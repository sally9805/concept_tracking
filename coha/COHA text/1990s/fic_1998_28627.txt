Friday nights , after the services and the meal , while the women of the house finished in the kitchen and settled down with books , Birnbaum and his son walked . They headed west , up the boulevard toward the city , or east , deeper into Queens . They marked their passage by landmarks -- the Midway Pharmacy , which bulged onto the boulevard ; the flat gray edifice of the county courthouse ; the bank , which was a replica of Independence Hall in Philadelphia . They recited the neighborhoods they passed into -- Rego Park , Corona , Kew Gardens . From odd vantage points they could see bridges -- the Verrazano , the green lights of the Throgs Neck ; on clear nights , very far off , the GW , or maybe it was the Triborough -- they could never be certain . Across Queens Boulevard they entered the shaded precinct of Forest Park , where the streets were softly lit by gas lamps and black , unmarred lawns lapped serene and elegant houses . Their conversation was muted , filled with a quiet and reluctant awe . Behind bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was dancing , right in somebody 's living room . Mahogany bookshelves , a special ladder on wheels just for books ; on their walls paintings , objects from foreign cultures , even their plates angled for display . His father never said a word but the boy understood that these people had what should be theirs , at least a portion of it , but that never would be . And it was a measure of the world 's perversity , the inherent unfairness of things , that this would always be so . They walked down the boulevard into the Italian section , pastrestaurants and bowling alleys and bars , people cruising , draped from car windows to call someone 's name . By the Trylon Theater , kids , not much older than David , boys in jeans and T-shirts , girls in short plaid skirts and leather jackets , out on their own , smoking cigarettes , kissing , touching each other in full view of whoever passed . Sometimes a bright glance sizing him up , a searing flash of invitation , then amused smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to hurry through these streets but his father liked to take them slowly . Before the brick-fronted clubs with their neon signs in looping script , men in knit shirts stood smoking , rubbing down cars , overseeing the street . David kept his eyes averted , aware of their Shabbos clothing , strayed from their own neighborhood , while his father distributed Good evenings , How are yous , as if he knew these men . As if they might say , Good evening to you , sir , why not stop and have a drink with us ? , and he could smile and say , No , no , my son and I are out walking , perhaps another time . They walked for hours , talking , not talking . Once they kept going , ended up in Whitestone , all the way to the water . In a park under the bridge they were the only people , the gray southern pylon towering over them like some ancient battlement , a fortress 's looming wall . Far out on the black water lights bobbed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . After half an hour , the only ones in the park , Birnbaum said to his son , Did you see ? That Friday they did n't get home till past midnight . But their favorite spot was not far off , east on the boulevard , then south on Union Turnpike , a few blocks to the overpass . From here , they could see twenty-two roads , east , west , north , south . Four major highways converged at this spot , dumping cars onto service roads , trading traffic in a maze of interchanges and swooping ramps that circled high above their heads , doubled back , and fanned out into more highway . Close by was the IND subway yard , where trains done for the night would pull themselves across their own bridge with a faint metallic chatter the boy could make out , tracing the lit windows and the pink circle at the train 's back until it came to rest in the yard and went dark . It was loud here , a whirring background tumble of noise , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the trains , the sound effect of a truck passing above them , spiraling , then disappearing in a stream of taillights toward the east . With their hands on the cold steel rail , they stood and watched , slowly turning their heads , feeling the distant flutter of traffic through the tips of their fingers . His father pointed things out . " Those trucks drive out to the Long Island farms at night , " he would say . " The cabbies are lining up for La Guardia . " " From here you could go anywhere , anywhere on earth . " The high school where his father taught had once reminded David of a castle . Older , looking back , he retained the memory , though he could hardly understand what had given him the idea . There were two scarred cement columns at the top of a wide staircase , and if you stood across the street and looked , a certain symmetry to the tall windows above the entrance , the gilt lettering on black glass to either side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name . It was a serious place -- it even smelled serious , something deeper about its mustiness than in David 's school , as if no one here ever opened a window -- and no matter what time he arrived there were always groups of boys huddled over Talmuds in the harshly lit rooms . There was no playground , no gym . This was a school for scholars , for future rabbis , and even the students wore suits and hats . David remembered running through these halls . A secretary who had long since died or retired gave him odd , sweet , coffee-flavored candies . Now he was shy and resentful coming here , fingering the baseball cards in his pocket , hurrying through the first floor , where boys swayed over books , murmuring . His father 's class was on the second floor , down the hallway to the back . On the walls no posters , no maps , not even the little grids by the stairwells telling you where to go in case of emergency or fire . Between two classrooms , portraits of the founder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Country . The founder was dignified and humorless . The founder 's father was in a fur hat and faded striped coat , pictured from the waist up , smiling a smile somehow both kindly and insinuating . He had died protecting his school from the Germans . His eyes followed you wherever you went . The impression he always got approaching his father 's classroom was of books as an ocean , his father adrift among them , possibly going down . There were books on the sills , on the students ' wooden desks , on a long table near the window , books piled open-face on each other , threatening to spill onto the floor . There were books on his father 's desk , and beside it a worn wooden box , filled with more books . Sometimes David knocked , sometimes he walked straight in , so his father would look up and see him . Other times he stood at the door , playing a game he did not really enjoy , seeing how long it would be before his father , hunched over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would notice him . David felt uncomfortable standing there , as if he were spying on someone 's privacy , and sometimes he was , his father shifting in his chair to pass gas , picking his nose -- but , uncomfortable or not , he did it anyway . He watched his father 's big head under its black yarmulke , watched his incomprehensible scrawl on the yellow writing paper , thought if he was an Arab terrorist or some crazed sniper like the man who shot Kennedy he could have picked him off twenty times by now . Still other times he just stood there and thought , This is his other world , when he 's not home with us . The response when it came , in any case , was always the same . His father would look up , startled , genuinely surprised to see him there , glad . He would check his watch . " Am I late ? " he would say , knowing he was , enjoying the ritual , " Just one more second . " And David would bring out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall , embarrassed in more ways than he could acknowledge , at his father 's absent-mindedness -- two , three times every week he had to come get him for dinner -- at his own unwanted role as messenger , at the shabby familiarity of these rooms and halls , at the way , whether he was ten minutes or two hours late , whether it was snowing outside or blazing hot , his father would look up from his books every time like a man shocked from dreaming , alarmed , happy , smiling to see him . On the way out , students would nod at his father , occasionally -- usually the younger ones -- stop and ask a question about their work . There were night classes , and students stayed at least as long as evening prayers , some after that , for dinner . It was a world David was suspicious of , and scorned , but even here he would have liked an occasional wave or smile from one of these serious young men , would have felt then much eased in his faltering sense of worldliness and self-possession . Who wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Older boys sat on the steps to argue , and they did n't rise , as David did n't for his teachers , as his father passed . They said good night in Yiddish or , not pausing in their conversations at all , simply raised their chins at his father , a bare acknowledgment in which David saw condescension , traces of contempt . It galled him that they knew his father in all his weaknesses -- his dreamy-mindedness , his affection for puns , his penchant for flying off the handle and his killing remorse afterwards -- they knew all these things as well as his own son did . He registered what he believed was the complacent derision in their faces , and recognized much the same in himself , which made him even angrier . He knew his father just that well , and of course he loved him . Did they ? Did they love him , these pale boys with their earlocks and green suits , smugly arguing laws nobody but they cared about anyway ? On the street , as his father pulled papers from his suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come undone , as he called , " Wait , David , tell me about your day , " the boy would tuck his chin into his neck and walk faster , willing himself deaf and blind . In Brooklyn , his father 's shul was a yellow brick building that , along with another shul next door , took up most of 50th Street between 13th and 14th Avenues . Birnbaum 's father had been rabbi here twenty years , was among the city 's prominent clergy , on school boards and planning commissions , knew aldermen , councilmen , deputy mayors . The script , though it had never been openly discussed , was that Birnbaum 's older brother , Rachmil , would take over one day . But he had not survived the war , the passage from Poland . The honor , the obligation , descended then to Birnbaum . But he was not his father , had other leanings , enjoyed his reading and translating medieval manuscripts , was uncomfortable speechifying , swaying crowds , being the center of everyone 's attention . Until the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in idle moments he saw himself up there , dispensing kind wisdom from the podium , leading the congregation with his example of quiet dedication and good works . His father distantly encouraged his scholarship , had even helped him get the job at the boy 's high school in Queens -- a favor , Birnbaum sometimes thought ; other times , exile . Now another man , Alan Ostrow , was being groomed as his father 's successor , and Birnbaum , who had managed to publish only a handful of monographs and one article , was not nearly as happy in his choices as he had once hoped to be , as his father 's impassive approval made him avow he was . He was disappointed in himself , and disappointed , obscurely , in his father , for accepting him as he had turned out . At the shul his position was conspicuous if not eminent . He was in charge of organizing the study groups and classes that met during the week , though he taught only occasionally himself . He was on committees , headed , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Jerusalem the shul sponsored . He was well liked , prized for his singing voice , his offhand humor . He sensed the congregation considered him one of them , approachable , one who could take a bit of ribbing , while the rabbi was grand , removed . This was true , and Birnbaum told himself it was all to the good . He tried to see himself as a simple Jew , a humble man who quietly did his duty to God and family and community . If he had doubts , he practiced keeping them to himself . And , if it was sometimes painful to admit this , given his relationship with his own father , he put great stock in his children . They were bright-eyed , affectionate , favorites among the congregation -- it was a special thing to be the rabbi 's grandchildren ( if not , he sometimes could n't help musing , the rabbi 's son ) and they seemed partly everyone 's kids . David had his clear singing voice , and Rachel a laugh everyone recognized , turned to smile at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community knew their most recent grades , what their teachers had to say . People would introduce his children as if they were their own : This year he learned twelve blat of Talmud by heart , most in his class . She did half the cooking for the seder , twenty-five people they fed . After the Torah reading David would climb the front steps to sit with his grandfather . As a young boy he had sat on his lap . Older , in his own suit and tie , he sat next to the rabbi , in a high-backed red-velvet chair identical to his and , across the velour-draped ark , the president of the congregation 's . You could hear him singing up there . Birnbaum would look over at Ruth , would try to catch his father 's attention -- here was something they could all be proud of together . When he had finally moved his family to Queens no one raised an eyebrow . It was nearer the job , after all . They had good schools for the children , the houses were newer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the right thing to do , people assured him . Brooklyn is finished , they all said . We 'll be joining you soon enough . But to Birnbaum there was defeat , a taint of abandonment in his leaving . He could n't put a name to it , did n't allow himself to , but he had never thought to leave . All his adult life , when he looked into his future -- well , he did n't know anymore what he saw , but he never saw this . Nothing was clearer than the logic of the move , the necessity , for it -- a man could n't stay forever in his father 's shadow , after all -- yet now he was doing it he had trouble keeping his mind turned forward toward the bright new life he and Ruthie had planned . It was reckless , he feared , and there would be costs . And this foreboding , this bracing for grief was only confirmed for him two years later when he returned to follow his father in the funeral cortege , Borough Park 's crowded streets hushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storekeepers , merchants , housewives , everyone in Brooklyn , it seemed , gathered in the streets to pay final respects to the great man . What Birnbaum remembered was the body before him in the box , swaying gently in the hearse , the cold door handle which he would n't let go of , all the long walk to the cemetery , the prayers and shattered apologies he offered under his breath .
