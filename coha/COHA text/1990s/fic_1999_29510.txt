" What if it 's a disaster ? " Sara asked as she got into bed . " It 's not going to be a disaster , " Jared said . " You 're going to be great . " " But what if I 'm not ? What if I 'm just average ? Maybe that 's what they were trying to tell me . Maybe that 's the lesson . " " There 's no lesson , and you 've never been average , " Jared said , joining his wife under the covers . " It 's just your first day of work . All you have to do is show up and be yourself . " He shut off the lamp on his nightstand and reached for the nearby alarm clock . " What time do you want to wake up ? " " How about six-thirty ? " Sara paused . " Actually , make it six-fifteen . " She paused again . " Five forty-five . Just in case the train 's running late . " " Shhhh , take a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his elbow . " It 's okay to be nervous , but there 's no reason to get nuts . " " I 'm sorry . I just  --  " " I know , " he said , taking her hand . " I know what 's riding on this one  --  I remember what happened last time . I promise you , though , you 're going to be great . " " You think so ? " " Absolutely . " " You really think so ? " " Sara , from this moment on , I 'm choosing to ignore you . " " Is that a yes or a no ? " Jared pulled one of the pillows from behind his head and held it over Sara 's face . " I refuse to acknowledge that question . " " Does that mean we 're done talking about work ? " Sara asked , her laughs muffled by the pillow . " Yes , we 're done talking about work . " Jared straddled his wife , keeping the pillow on her face . " Uh-oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull the pillow away , but she felt Jared press down even harder . " C'm on , that 's not funny , " she said . " It 's starting to hurt . " " Stop whining . " " What ? " she asked . He did n't respond . " I 'm serious , Jared . I ca n't breathe . " She felt him moving forward on her chest . Her left shoulder was suddenly pinned back by his knee . Then her right . " Jared , what 're you doing ? " She grabbed his wrists and dug her nails into his arm . He only pressed down harder . " Jared , get off me ! Get off me ! " Her body was convulsing now , violently trying to knock him from his perch . As her nails tore at his arms and legs , her lungs lurched for air . But all he did was hold tight . She wanted to stop fighting , but she could n't . Choking on her own tears , she called out his name . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jolted awake , Sara shot up in bed . Her face was covered in sweat and the room was silent . Jared was asleep next to her . Just a dream , she told herself , trying to stop her heart from racing . It 's okay . But as she put her head back on the pillow , she could n't let it go . Even more than the others , this one felt real . Her fears , his response , even his touch . All so real . It was n't about Jared , though , she told herself . It was about work . To prove it to herself , she pressed her body up against her husband and wrapped an arm around his chest . He felt warm under the covers . Clearly , it was about work . She took a deep breath and squinted at the clock on Jared 's nightstand . Two more hours , she realized . Only two more hours . " Here 's what I want , " Jared said to the redheaded man behind the counter at Mike 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all , of the seeds scraped off , a light schmear of cream cheese , and a coffee  --  very light , with one spoon of sugar . " " That 's nice , dear , " Sara said . " While you 're at it , why do n't you just ask him to suck the nougat out of the Snickers ? " " Do n't give him any ideas . " The man behind the counter started on Jared 's order . " In my whole life , I 've never seen a man who gave more instructions for a stinking bagel and coffee . You 'd think it was a work of art or something . " " Mikey , by the time you 're done with it , it will be , " Jared said with a wink . " Do n't suck up to me , " Mikey said . He turned to Sara . " Now what does the normal half of the family want ? " " Whatever you want to get rid of . Just make it exciting  --  nothing plain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my favorite , " Mikey sang . " No headache , no pain-in-the-ass demands , just normal , considerate  --  " " Are you the manager ? " a gray-haired woman with large glasses interrupted . " That I am , " Mikey said . " Can I help you ? " " I doubt it . I just want to register a complaint . " She pulled a coupon from the pocket of her LOVE IS A PIANO TEACHER book bag and thrust it across the counter . " This coupon says that I get one dollar off a box of original flavor Cheerios . But when I checked the shelves , I saw that you 're out of this item and that the coupon expires tomorrow . " " I 'm sorry , ma'am , but we 're a very small store with limited space . If you want , you 're welcome to use the coupon on the other flavors of Cheerios . We have multigrain , and honey-nut , and  --  " " I do n't want any other Cheerios . I want these Cheerios ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store to turn and look . " And do n't think I do n't know what you 're doing . When you print up these flyers with the coupons , you hide all the items in the back room . That way we can never redeem them . " " Actually , ma'am , we just do n't have the space to  --  " " I do n't want to hear your excuses . What you 're doing is false advertising ! And that means it 's illegal . " " No , it 's not , " Sara and Jared said simultaneously . Surprised , the woman looked over at the couple , who were still waiting for their bagels . " Yes , it is , " she insisted . " When he sends out those coupons he 's making an offer for his products . " " Hate to break it to you , but an advertisement is n't an offer , " Sara said . " Unless it specifies an exact quantity or indicates exactly who can accept it , " Jared added . " Uh-oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I smell lawyers . " " Why do n't you both mind your own business ? " the woman snapped . " Then why do n't you leave our friend alone ? " Sara said . " I did n't ask for your opinion . " " And our friend did n't ask to be talked down to like he was a piece of garbage , " Sara shot back . " Now , as a Cheerios lover myself , I can appreciate your frustration , but we do n't go for that kind of unpleasantness here . Instead , we 've taken a new approach : It 's called acting civilly to each other . I can understand if you do n't want to participate , but that 's the way we play it . So if you do n't like it , why do n't you make like a coupon and disappear . " As Jared fought to contain his laughter , the woman sneered at Mikey . " You 'll never see me in this establishment again , " she seethed . " I 'll live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman turned and stormed out of the store . Mikey looked over at his two favorite customers . " Make like a coupon and disappear ? " " What can I say ? I was under pressure . " " It did get her to leave , " Jared pointed out . " You 're right about that , " Mikey agreed . " Which means breakfast 's on me . " Fifteen minutes later , Sara and Jared were crammed in the middle of a packed-to-capacity subway car . Sara was dressed in her best navy-blue pantsuit , while Jared wore a frayed Columbia Law sweatshirt and a pair of jogging shorts . A long-distance runner since his early years in high school , Jared still had his athletic build , although a small bald spot on the back of his head made him feel far older than he looked . With his suit packed neatly in a trifolding backpack , he began every Monday , Wednesday , and Friday with a half-hour run . " That 's not a bad way to start the day , " Jared said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day on the job and you already have a victory . " " I do n't know , " Sara said as the train pulled away from the Fifty-ninth Street stop . " There 's a big difference between cranky piano teachers and actual criminals . And if past performance is any indication , this job is going to be an even bigger loser than the last one . " " One stupid incident at one hotshot law firm means nothing about your value in the job market . " " But six months of looking  --  c'm on , Jared . " " I do n't care , you 're going to be great . " Sara rolled her eyes . " Do n't give me that look , " Jared added . " I know what you 're thinking and it 's not true . " " Oh , so now you think you can read my mind ? " " I do n't think I can read your mind  --  I know I can read your mind . " " Really ? " " Really . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot . What 's going through my panicky little brain ? " Jared closed his eyes and rubbed his temples . " I see great unrest . Great neurosis . No , wait  --  I see a handsome , brilliant , casually dressed husband . My , my , my , is he a good-looking one .... " " Jared .... " " That 's his name  --  Jared ! My God , we 're sharing the same vision . " " I 'm serious . What if this job does n't work out ? The article in the Times .... " " Forget about the Times . All it said was that the mayor was announcing budget cuts . Even if it leads to layoffs , that does n't mean you 're going to be fired . If you want to be safe , though , you can call Judge Flynn and  --  " " I told you last night , I 'm not calling him , " Sara interrupted . " If I 'm going to stay here , I want it to be because I deserve it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't argue the point further . Since they had first met , Sara never wanted special treatment  --  no professional favors , no help . Her independent streak ran deep : When Jared 's uncle had offered to put in a good word so she could get an interview at his law firm , Sara had refused . To Jared , her logic was irrational and counterproductive . But Jared thrived on connections ; Sara despised them . " I 'm sorry I even brought it up , " he finally said . " Besides , if this job does n't work out , you can always find another . " " No . No way , " she insisted . " My psyche 's taken enough of a beating . " " That 's exactly what I was about to say , " Jared backpedaled . " No more psyche-beating for you . They 're going to love you here , and they 're going to realize you 're a genius , and unlike Winick and Trudeau , they 're never going to fire you . Starting today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby-fresh-scent perfumes . You 're not going to have to worry about the budget cuts and the butterflies will never swarm in your stomach . " " Let me ask you something , " Sara said with an affectionate smile . " Do you really believe all the noise that comes out of your mouth ? " " I 'm a defense attorney . That 's my job . " " Yeah , well you 're making the rest of us lawyers look bad . " " You 're not a lawyer anymore  --  starting today , you 're a DA . " " And that means I 'm not a lawyer ? " " Once you go to the district attorney 's office , you become a vampire . All you 'll care about is arresting and convicting innocent people . " " Says the man who helps guilty criminals go free . " " Says the self-righteous DA . " " Says the man who will never again have sex with his wife . " Jared laughed as the train pulled into the Fiftieth Street stop . " Says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should never again be doubted . " " Thank you , " Sara said . He kissed her then  --  a lingering kiss . " You 're going to miss your stop , " she said , pulling away . The doors of the train closed . " Do n't worry , " Jared said . " Today I 'm taking it downtown . " " You have some work in court ? " " No , " he said with a grin . " I just want to check out a new jogging path . I figure I 'll start at the courthouse and work my way back to the office . " " Wait a minute . You 're going to run an extra thirty blocks just so you can walk me to work ? " " It 's your first day , is n't it ? " She could n't help but smile . " You do n't have to do that . " " I know , " Jared said . When the number nine train arrived at Franklin Street , Sara and Jared got off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcrowded streets . The September morning was warm and bright and as close to sunny as the Manhattan skyline allowed . " All set ? " Jared asked . " All set , " Sara said . " They have no idea what they 're in for . " " There we go  --  that 's what I like to hear . " " In fact , if I get any more excited , I may get in another fight just for fun . " " Okay , hon , but no more than two a day . " " I promise , " she said . " That 's my limit . " Jared gave his wife a quick kiss , then took one last look at the woman he loved . When they first met , he was captivated by her deep green eyes and expressive eyebrows  --  he thought they made her attractive in an understated way . He also loved the fact that she wore no makeup except for a stroke of blush . Remembering the moment , Jared turned away and started his jog to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder as he headed up West Broadway . " And do n't forget : You 're smarter than everyone ! " Watching her husband wave good-bye , Sara laughed at how goofy he was . And within a minute of leaving him , she also realized how wrong he was . Now Sara was alone . And the butterflies were swarming . Tucking a stray curl behind her ear , Sara tried to get her bearings . She was the only still point in a flood of people , all in dark suits , all with briefcases , all in a hurry . All lawyers , she thought . Steeling herself with a tightened jaw , she headed forcefully toward Centre Street . " Kill the butterflies . Kill the butterflies . Kill the butterflies , " she whispered to herself . * * * * * * * At 80 Centre Street , the drab brick building that was home to the Manhattan District Attorney 's Office , Sara followed her mental map toward the elevators at the back of the building . As she headed down the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women in navy-blue suits pushed past her at a frantic pace . A man carrying an armful of files bumped into her and continued on his way . A woman in a pin-striped suit chased him . " Do n't forget  --  we have the Schopf hearing at two ! " she yelled . Another man , pushing a small cart full of files , wove his way through the morning crowd shouting , " Late for court ! Late for court ! " Frenzied and bleary-eyed , some of them looked like they had n't slept in days . But if there was any doubt that being an assistant DA was one of the most sought-after jobs in the city , one needed only to look at the six-month waiting list to interview for the position . Watching each of the tiny operas that played out around her , Sara felt her panic give way to excitement . After six long months , the law was once again animated and alive . This was why she wanted to work in the DA 's office  --  her old law firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits , never had anything like this vitality . To some , it was chaos . But to Sara , it was the biggest lure of the job . On the seventh floor , Sara passed through a metal detector and walked down a wide hallway with faded blue industrial carpet that reminded her of her old junior high school . Following the room numbers as she searched for her office , Sara could n't help but notice that plastic dry-cleaning bags hung from every available hook and decorated almost every single coatrack in the twisting hallway . Not a good sign for free time , she thought as she reached room 727 . The room number was painted on the translucent glass window of the heavy oak door , and no one was sitting at the desk outside the office . Feeling no need to wait , Sara opened the door and stepped inside . Her office was exactly what she expected : a large metal desk ; a Formica credenza that held an outdated computer ; a Leatherette desk chair ; two metal folding chairs ; two large metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sentencing guidelines , and other legal books ; and a coatrack , with dry cleaning hanging on one of the hooks . Typical government office . " Sara Tate , right ? " A stocky young man entered the office . " That 's me , " she said . " And you are .... " " I 'm Alexander Guff  --  your TPA . " Noticing the blank look on Sara 's face , he added , " Trial prep assistant . " " Which means ? " " Which means I do whatever you need me to do . At the very least , I 'm your secretary . But if you want to take me under your wing , I 'm your assistant , your right-hand man , your boy Friday , the Jimmy Olsen to your Superman , the Watson to your Holmes .... " " The Captain to my Tennille ? " " Yeah , something like that , " Guff said with a laugh . Guff was short and stocky , with bushy black hair that reminded Sara of a Brillo pad . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posture , which made him look like he had a slight humpback . " I know what you 're thinking , " Guff said , stuffing his hands in his pockets . " No , I do n't have a hump  --  this is just the way I stand . I 'm a nervous kid and this is an outward symptom of my internal anxieties . And just so you know , I also like to stuff my hands in my pockets . It helps me think . " " Whatever makes you happy , " Sara said with a shrug . " See , I can already tell I like you , " Guff said . " You see it , you say it , you let it rest . That 's a good sign . We 'll get along . " " Are you always this blunt ? " Sara asked . " This is just the way I am . Sometimes people like it , sometimes I creep people out . " " So that 's the nutshell , huh ? " Sara asked , taking a seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 're the witty assistant ? " " Do I look that obvious to you ? " Guff asked , pulling out a chair and sitting down opposite her . " I have n't decided yet . Keep talking . " She wanted to ask him about the budget cuts , but she still was n't sure if she could trust him . And she was n't about to open up quite so fast . " How long have you lived in the city ? " she added , trying to get more information . " Only since I graduated from college , which makes a little over two years . Personally , I 'd prefer living at home and saving some money , but I 'm in the process of revolting against my suburban upbringing . " " Oh , you are ? " Sara asked doubtfully . " And you 're doing this how ? By working in the DA 's office ? " " Of course not . I 'm doing it by just existing . I mean , look at me . With this posture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father is a doctor ? That my mom drives carpool ? " " Give me a break , " Sara said . " You sound just like my husband . " " So the ring 's for real , huh ? " Guff asked . " Real for six years . " She tapped her platinum-and-gold wedding band against her desk . " See , that 's just my luck , " Guff said . " All the good ones are taken . I can never meet someone who 's on her own , who is n't a psycho , who does n't want to set fire to my futon , who  --  " " Who digs suburban anarchists who think they 're much more rebellious than they are ? " Leaning back in his seat , Guff laughed . " No offense , Guff , but the entire female population is not plotting against you . " " Tell that to my Beatles collection and my missing stereo . I mean , my life is proof to the contrary . " " Uh-oh , chronic paranoia . Does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Depends how you define nut . I 'm not a fan of the overused conspiracies that Hollywood keeps recycling , but I do believe there are some unexplained phenomena we ca n't answer . For example , take your typical deck of cards . If you add up the number of letters in the words ace , two , three , four , all the way up to jack , queen , and king , you get the number fifty-two  --  the same as the number of cards in every deck . " Sara paused a moment . " So ? " " Secret code , baby . Believe the hype . " Sara shook her head , amused . " Do n't blame me  --  it 's all in the upbringing . " " With that , I actually agree . " " Of course you do  --  we 're all the product of our families . That 's why you have to tell me about yours . Do you have any brothers or sisters ? Are your parents crazy-insane like mine  --  " " My parents were both killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupted , stopping Guff in midsentence . " They were on their way back from a day trip to Connecticut when they hit a patch of ice , " Sara explained . " Their car slid across the road and plowed into an oncoming van . They died instantly . " " I 'm really sorry . I did n't mean to  --  " " It 's okay , " Sara said , forcing confidence into her voice . " You could n't have known . " " But I  --  " " Guff , please do n't worry about it . Everyone on this planet has a memory they 'd rather not recall . We just happened to hit mine early . Now let 's move on  --  we were having a good time . " Noticing the embarrassed look in Guff 's eyes , Sara realized he was genuinely upset . It was clear he felt awful that he 'd hurt her . That was all Sara needed to see . This was a good guy . Now she could open up . Taking a deep breath , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article in yesterday 's Times ? " " You saw that , huh ? " " It 's not good , is it ? " Guff paused . " Maybe you should go see Monaghan , " he said , referring to the district attorney . " Do n't do that , Guff . If you know something , tell me . " " All I know is the mayor 's trying to shrink the number of city employees by announcing across-the-board budget cuts for all city offices . " " Does that mean I 'm going to be fired ? " " I do n't know about you specifically , but when layoffs hit in this office , the last ones in are always the first ones out . And since the moment I walked in this morning , the office rumor mill 's been buzzing like crazy  --  according to a guy on the elevator , all the new hires are supposed to be automatically on notice . " " No one 's told me a thing . " Guff pointed to the metal tray on Sara 's desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm sorry , Sara . " Sara snatched up the single sheet of paper and read through a memorandum addressed to the entire staff of the Manhattan District Attorney 's Office . According to the memo , the mayor 's recent announcement " will require us to reevaluate our current staff size . In keeping with the historical precedents of this office , decisions will be made proportionately among support staff , trial assistants , and attorneys . While these decisions will be difficult for all involved , we expect that this period of reorganization will not interfere with the day-to-day operations of this office . " " I ca n't believe this , " Sara said , her voice cracking . " I ca n't lose this job . " " Are you okay ? " Guff asked . " I 'm fine , " she said , unconvincingly . " I just do n't understand it . Why now ? " " Are you kidding ? We have an election coming up next year . The mayor 's no dummy  --  he knows big government is out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll look efficient , fair , and industrious all in a day 's work . It 's a political coup . " Sara put her hands behind her neck , trying to massage away the tension . As she tried to organize her thoughts , her mind was reeling . This was even worse than she expected  --  a wrecking ball against her ego . Why is it happening again ? she wondered . Why is n't it ever easy ? Feeling self-pity wash over her , Sara remained silent . " Sorry . I did n't mean to ruin your day so quickly . " For a long minute , Sara did n't say a word . But when she realized that she could n't just sit there and sulk , self-pity slowly gave way to defiance . What would Jared do ? she asked herself . No , do n't do it like that . This is n't his . It 's yours . It 's yours and it 's not so bad , she thought . You 've been through worse . Much worse . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not alone . At least here you can use your brain . That 's what he said : You 're smart . You 're smarter than everyone . Looking up at Guff , Sara broke her silence . " When do you think Monaghan 's going to take action on the memo ? " " Probably a week or two . Why ? " " I want to know how much time I have . " " Sounds like you have a plan . " " Not at all . But it took me six months to get this job , so I 'm not losing it without a brawl . " Impressed by his boss 's determination , Guff asked , " Then what do we do now ? " " You tell me , " Sara said . " You 're the one who works here . " " All I know is you have to be in orientation until lunch , and I have a doctor 's appointment this afternoon , so we probably ca n't get started on a solution until tomorrow . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wall . She looked back at Guff . " What do you think my chances are ? " " My honest opinion ? " " Of course . " " Then let me put it this way : If I were a betting man .... " He paused . " What ? Tell me . " " I 'd put my money on another horse . " It was only one in the afternoon when Sara arrived back at her office , but her face was already showing signs of exhaustion . Although the four-hour orientation session was supposed to be a simple and informative introduction to the DA 's office , Sara spent every hour of it worrying about who would be the first to go . Still trying to figure out the answer , she collapsed in her seat . Before she could even catch her breath , the phone rang . " This is Sara , " she answered . " Well ? " Jared asked . " How is it ? I 've been calling all morning , but you have n't been there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , I found out I 'm going to be fired . " " You were fired ? " " Not yet  --  but Monaghan announced layoffs this morning and everyone thinks I 'll be the first to go . " " Says who ? " " Says my assistant .... " " What does your assistant know ? " " ... and my orientation leader , " Sara continued , " and the woman who helped me fill out my paperwork , and the attorney I had to cross-examine during my mock trial , and the four other lawyers I met in the .... " Her voice broke and her eyes welled up with tears . " I 'm not like you , Jared  --  it does n't all work out for me . That 's why people think I 'm such a failure . " " Whoa , whoa , whoa , " Jared interrupted . " No one thinks you 're a failure . This is n't anything personal  --  it 's a budget cut . " " But you know what comes next , " Sara said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejection letters .... " " Shhhhhh , calm down , " Jared said . " You 're going to be great . " " The only one who thinks that is you . " " That 's not true . Pop called me first thing this morning to ask if you won your first case yet . " " Jared , you 're talking about my grandfather . He 's not exactly an unbiased source . " " It does n't matter . You 're still going to be fantastic . " " No , I 'm not . I 'm not prepared for  --  " " Hunter College , magna cum laude . " " Big deal  --  it 's a small city school . " " What about Columbia Law School ? " " My parents paid the dean to get me in . " " No , they did n't , " Jared said . " And even if they did , did n't you do well there ? " " I guess . " Sara shot from her seat and walked around to the front of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry for myself ? I sound like I 'm in high school . Change the subject . What 's going on there ? " " Nothing , " Jared said . " I 'll tell you about it later . " Sara raised an eyebrow . " Tell me about it now . " " It 's not that important . " Something was wrong . " Jared , you better not be doing what I think you 're doing . " " Which is what ? " " Which is hiding good news just because you 're worried about me . " " I 'm not hiding anything . It 's not even that big a  --  " " See , I knew it . I knew that 's what you were doing . Now spill it . " Reluctantly , Jared gave in . " When I was coming back from lunch , Wayne came up to me and told me I was , quote , ' on the right track . ' " " Wayne ? " Sara asked , excited . " As in Thomas Wayne ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The general consensus is that I 'll be up for partner within the next six months  --  depending on how much business I bring in . " " That 's fantastic , " Sara said . Jared did n't respond . " Do n't tell me you 're still worried about bringing in business , " she added . " That 's why I did n't want to bring this up now .... " " Jared , I appreciate what you 're trying to do , but I can handle two things at once . Now stop hiding and start talking . What about the list we made ? Who 's left on that ? " " No one  --  I tried them all . Our alumni associations , the chamber of commerce , the synagogue , the church , the Ninety-second Street Y , the Democrats , the Republicans , the Kiwanis Club , the Rotary Club , the Toastmasters  --  if they have a newsletter , I 've put an ad in it ; if they have a meeting , I 've sat in on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Honey , I know you 're not used to being human like the rest of us , but it 's okay to admit that something 's actually a challenge . That does n't mean it 's your fault . " " I disagree . There 's got to be something I 'm overlooking . Maybe I should dress a little more casually next time  --  just so they do n't feel like it 's a hard sell . " " You never stop , do you ? " " Not until I figure it out . There 's always a solution . " " Now you 're suddenly bold ? " " I 'm always bold . " " Jared , the only reason you wear your slacks uncuffed is because your dad still does . " " That has nothing to do with a lack of boldness . The uncuffed look is elegant . It 's flawless . It 's in . " " No offense , dear , but you have no idea what 's in . And if it was n't for me , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you calling me a square ? " " All I 'm saying is , we 're no closer to solving the problem . " Just then , Guff entered her office . " Who wants to save their job today ? " he sang . " Give me one second , " Sara said to Guff , putting her hand over the mouthpiece . " Jared , I really should run . " " Everything okay ? " " Yeah . Hopefully , " she answered . " And by the way , thanks again for listening . " " Are you kidding ? That 's my pleasure . " Sara put down the phone and looked up at her assistant . " I asked a question , campers : Who wants to save their job ? " " What 're you doing here ? " Sara asked . " I thought you had a doctor 's appointment . " " I just heard Transportation 's letting three hundred people go , so I decided to cancel it . If this thing is moving as quick as I think it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And how 'd you know I would n't be out at lunch ? " " Once again , I must thank that wicked queen I call deductive reasoning .
