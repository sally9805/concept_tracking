The outer Cape in mid-October . A new tilt to the earth and its altered angle to the sun make for a suffusing clarity . Hopper 's light . With the tourists gone , the beaches have been reclaimed by gulls , and the road that traverses the peninsula is bare . At this time of year , delays occur behind school buses . <p> Telephone to his ear , Bernardin looks at the evolving geometry of the painting on the easel in his studio , and , filled with dread and sadness at what he is hearing , conjures up the face of Malcolm , who , according to a tearful Jocelyn , has just been pried dead from the wreckage of a head-on at the blinking yellow on Route 6 by something called the Jaws of Life . The woman who was Malcolm 's passenger has been taken to the hospital in Hyannis . The driver of the truck that crossed the center dividing line and struck them is unhurt . <p> " D' you know this woman ? " Jocelyn asks . <p> " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of us do . " <p> Malcolm 's secret , Bernardin thinks . <p> " The hospital 's calling her Jane Doe . " <p> " I 'd better call the hospital , " Bernardin says . This enables him to hang up without answering further questions . <p> A nurse in the emergency room tells him that the Jane Doe brought in by the rescue squad is in serious but stable condition with head injuries . <p> " Her name is Ingrid Torquist , " Bernardin says . " She lives in Oregon <p> " Are you by chance a relative ? " <p> " A friend , " says Bernardin , going back two hours in time , when Malcolm and Ingrid stopped by his place on their way to Malcolm 's house to pick up her luggage before driving up to Boston , so she could take a plane to Portland and tell her husband that she was leaving him and coming back to live with Malcolm , whom she has always loved . They imparted this intention to Bernardin in breathless confidence . Like a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's daughter , who is at college in Connecticut , and whom she just visited on the occasion of parents ' weekend , does n't know what 's afoot . <p> " Is Mrs. Torquist conscious ? " Bernardin inquires . <p> " Off and on . She 's been asking for someone named Malcolm . " <p> Malcolm of the grand , impulsive gesture , Bernardin thinks . " Tell her that Harry called , " he says . " Tell her I 'm going to contact her daughter and bring her to the hospital . " <p> A few minutes later , Bernardin finds himself talking to a dean of women , whose suspicions have been honed by the feminist times and the fact that Bernardin has forgotten Ingrid 's daughter 's Christian name . This is not an altogether surprising lapse , since he has only met her once , during the spring , when she and her mother spent a weekend at Malcolm 's while visiting various colleges in New England to which the daughter had been accepted . <p> " We 're very careful when granting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains . <p> Bernardin wonders if he should offer to supply some character references . The only names that come to mind , however , are those of his art dealer in New York and some gallery owners in Provincetown  --  none of whom are likely to inspire trust and confidence in the dean , whom he imagines to be thin-lipped . " Miss Torquist will remember me , " he says . " She and her mother and I had dinner last April at Malcolm Prescott 's house . " <p> His own memory of that improbably romantic evening  --  he will learn later that it was the first meeting between Malcolm and Ingrid in twenty years  --  remains vivid : Malcolm getting sloshed on bourbon while steaming lobsters in the kitchen ; Ingrid , languid as a cat in sunshine , watching from the table ; the daughter beside her absorbed in her impending choice of schools ; Bernardin unaware of having been invited for the same reason that Gatsby invited Carraway to tea with Daisy , but sensing that the occasion is momentous because of Malcolm 's elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( past fifty ) seldom confide in one another about women , and when they do they tend to leave out the details-even when they 're as close to each other as Bernardin and Malcolm considered themselves to be . <p> Bernardin decides not to tell the dean that Malcolm has been killed in the car crash . There 's no point in upsetting Maria any more than necessary . <p> " Maria ! " he exclaims . " Maria Torquist . " <p> The dean does not respond to this evidence of recovered memory . She asks Bernardin for his telephone number and that of the hospital , and says that she 'll call back . When she does , an hour later , it is to tell him that everything has been arranged . Maria has contacted her father , who will fly east tomorrow . Meanwhile , she and her roommate are packing . They will arrive at the airport in Hyannis on a chartered plane at about seven o'clock that evening . <p> " I 'll be on hand to meet them , " Bernardin says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replies . <p> There is windshield glass in the roadway at the blinking yellow , but the wreckage of Malcolm 's car and the truck that struck it have been towed away . The glass glitters in the flat trajectory of late afternoon light . Bernardin turns off the highway and drives out over Sansquit Neck to Malcolm 's house . Malcolm 's son , Ryan , who cooks at a restaurant in Chatham , opens the door and steps into Bernardin 's consoling hug . Beyond the young man 's shoulder , Bernardin sees two women whom he vaguely recognizes as neighbors , sitting on a sofa in the living room , beneath a wall on which one of his own watercolors and some of Malcolm 's photographs are hanging . Among the photographs are a battle scene taken at Pleiku and a female nude taken from behind . There are other people in the room Bernardin does not know . He does not see Malcolm 's wife , Helena , who suffers from schizophrenia and is in an institution . <p> " Has your mother been told ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Boston . She 'll be here soon <p> " I 'm on my way to the airport to meet Ingrid 's daughter , " Bernardin says . " I came by to pick up her bags . They 're probably upstairs , " he adds , aware that even if Ryan has figured out about his father and Ingrid , grief may have prevented him from considering the delicate problem that the presence of her luggage might now present . <p> As they are putting Ingrid 's suitcases into Bernardin 's car , Ryan tells him that the police have called about her purse . A garageman found it in the wreck , after it was towed away . They 're holding it at the station . <p> The plane that taxis up to the chain-link fence in front of the terminal is small and improbably sleek . Maria smiles and waves at Bernardin as she alights . She is taller and more heavily boned and not as delicate as her mother , whose chiseled features and pale complexion remind Bernardin of a European actress , whose name , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her roommate is a solemn-looking redhead , who appears to have been crying . While the pilot is pulling their bags from the nose compartment , Bernardin tells Maria that a staff neurologist has been notified of her arrival and is waiting at the hospital . He suggests that she inquire about the advisability of transferring her mother up to Massachusetts General so she can be examined by specialists there . <p> The neurologist says that Ingrid is suffering from a severe concussion , a broken nose , and a dislocated knee . When Maria asks about the specialists at Mass . General , he says that he expects Ingrid to pull through without complications and that it would be unwise to move her now . Happily , a CAT scan has not revealed any dangerous swelling of the brain . <p> When a nurse takes Maria in to see her mother , Bernardin is left in the waiting room with the roommate , whose name is Alison . <p> " She 's been terrific about all of this , " Alison says . " I 've been more scared than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , " Bernardin replies . He is thinking of how Malcolm would have hated the idea of people watching as he was being extracted from the wreckage by the Jaws of Life . <p> When Maria returns , she describes how Ingrid looks . " Both her eyes are black , and her whole face is black and blue and swollen , and she keeps crying out for Malcolm . The nurse and I tried to tell her he was dead , but she wo n't listen . She just keeps crying out his name <p> " She 's in shock , " Bernardin says , putting an arm around Maria 's shoulder . " It 'll wear off gradually . " <p> " But the way she keeps crying out his name . It 's so hysterical <p> " She 's in shock , " Bernardin explains again . <p> " I did n't even know she was coming here . I thought she was flying home from Boston . " <p> " The Cape 's only an hour or two out of the way . She probably wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot about the Cape , " Maria says . " She loved it here <p> She loved Malcolm here , Bernardin thinks . During the summer , twenty years ago ... " The police have your mother 's purse for safekeeping , " he tells Maria . " We 'll pick it up on the way to my place <p> The duty officer at the station , who sits at a desk that is bathed in glare , seems uncertain about his authority to release the purse . He telephones the chief , who lives close by . The chief  --  short , stout , and in uniform  --  arrives a few minutes later . Bernardin knows that to Malcolm 's mortification he and his men were called to the house on several occasions , when Helena got out of hand . He asks Maria a number of questions about her mother  --  maiden name , date of birth , that kind of thing  --  which means that he has probably examined the contents of the purse . In the end , he seems reluctant to hand it over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Only that we prefer to return personal effects to an adult relative . " <p> " This young lady 's in college , " Bernardin says . " Her father wo n't arrive until late tomorrow , and when he does he 'll want to be with his wife <p> The chief gives a nod of understanding and instructs the duty officer to make out a property transfer slip for Maria to sign . While this is being done , he draws Bernardin aside . <p> " Rotten shame about Prescott he says . <p> " A sad business Bernardin agrees . <p> " Quite a photographer , was n't he ! " <p> Of war and women , Bernardin thinks . <p> " How 's the girl 's mother ? " <p> " In a state of shock . " <p> " Conscious ? " <p> " Pretty much . " <p> " You 'll see she gets the purse and not the husband ? " The chief has put unmistakable emphasis upon the feminine pronoun . <p> " If you think it 's best . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief tells him . <p> Malcolm 's house is ablaze with a false festivity of light . Cars have been parked every which way in the wild rose and bearberry that line the dirt drive leading to it . Inside , Bernardin introduces Maria and Alison to Helena and Ryan , who are sitting on the sofa in the living room . Maria offers words of sympathy to Helena , who blinks like a child struggling to stay alert at a party . " Should n't I know you ! " she inquires . <p> ' Maria 's mother was a friend of Malcolm 's , " Bernardin explains . <p> " She was hurt in the accident but she 's going to be all right <p> " Well , that 's good news Helena says . She pats the sofa cushion beside her that Ryan has vacated in order to take Maria and Alison off for something to drink . " Harry . Dear old Harry ( ' <p> Bernardin sits and takes her hand . " Helena , I 'm so terribly sorry <p> " Well , Harry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get you anything ? " <p> " I 'm not allowed to drink , you know . On account of my medication . Tell me about the girl you brought <p> " She goes to college in Connecticut . She and her roommate flew in this evening to visit her mother in the hospital . They 're going to spend the night at my place . " <p> " Guess what , " Helena says brightly . " It 's not her I thought I should know . It 's her mother . Did you ever hear about the first time she took a ride with Malcolm ? " <p> " That was a long time ago , " Bernardin tells her . <p> " Yes , it was , " Helena says . " Dear old Harry <p> When it seems right to leave , Bernardin fetches Alison and goes to look for Maria , whom he finds with Ryan in Malcolm 's study at the rear of the house . They are sitting in chairs , face to face and hands in hands , elbows on their knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better when she sees your father , " Ryan is saying . <p> " Right now , she 's terribly upset about your father , Ryan . She knows something awful has happened , but she ca n't remember what " When you see her tomorrow , tell her we 're pulling for her <p> When Bernardin arrives at his house , he shepherds Maria and Alison inside and shows them the guest room in which they 'll be sleeping . Then he sits them down at a counter in the kitchen , puts a kettle on for tea , and goes out to fetch their bags , which are sitting in the car trunk next to Ingrid 's . Best for everyone to have gotten Ingrid 's bags out of Malcolm 's house , he tells himself , knowing that he has at least managed to spare Helena , Ingrid , and Maria some unnecessary pain , not to mention Maria 's father , who will have enough on his hands without having to confront head-on a truth there is no longer any reason for him to have to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernardin thinks grimly , as he reaches up to close the hatch . But just then he remembers what the chief has said about Ingrid 's purse . <p> Bernardin carries all the luggage into the house and sets it down in the guest room . Then he goes into the kitchen and makes tea for the two young women , whose faces reflect the fatigue he feels in himself . The three of them need to get some sleep , he says . Tomorrow will be a long and busy day . <p> Maria agrees , for she is anxious to return to the hospital early so she can be with Ingrid . Also , she must remember to get rooms for herself and Alison and her father at a motel near the hospital , and arrange for her father to speak with the neurologist and his colleagues . <p> Bernardin has been trying to think of how best to say what he has decided he should say . " I brought your mother 's bags inside , " he tells Maria . " You ought to go through them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just to make sure everything 's in order <p> Maria gives him a look of puzzlement that is quickly canceled by a shrug . " If you think I should ... " <p> " In the morning will be fine , " Bernardin says . <p> He awakens to the sound of weeping , which is overlapped from time to time by a comforting voice , and , lying still in his bed , hopes it is a letter Maria has found and not  --  as he suspects from what the chief has said  --  a photograph . When the weeping shows no sign of abating , he climbs out of bed , pulls on his clothes , and goes into the kitchen to make some coffee . Alison joins him a few minutes later . <p> " I take it there was something in Ingrid 's purse , " he says . <p> " Yes , " Alison replies . " You knew all along , did n't you ? " <p> " I only guessed . " <p> " I do n't see why Maria had to find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Ingrid was lying half-conscious in the hospital ? " <p> " Whatever it was , was pretty explicit . Maria 's devastated . " <p> " That 's sex for you , " Bernardin tells her . " It 's always explicit , often devastating , but almost never tragic . " <p> " Are n't you being kind of cynical . " <p> " I 'm trying to keep things in perspective , " Bernardin replies . Good old Malcolm , he thinks . Plying his profession to the end ... " Why do n't you go get Maria so we can cheer her up ? " <p> When Maria comes into the kitchen , her eyes are red , but she has managed to compose herself . <p> Bernardin hands her a cup of coffee . " It must be a relief to find out your mother 's not a saint he says . <p> Maria laughs and starts to cry . <p> " Just think , " Bernardin tells her , " how much easier she 'll be to live with now . " <p> Maria wipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Once they arrive at the hospital , Bernardin arranges for the motel rooms , keeps Alison company , fetches soft drinks , does what he can . In the evening , he goes out to the airport to pick up Maria 's father , who flies in from Boston on a commuter plane . Hervold Torquist is a slender man in his early forties , with deep blue eyes and an earnest Swedish accent . As might be expected , he has some questions . <p> " Have I understood correctly from Maria that Ingrid has been a passenger in this car that crashed ! " <p> " That 's right , " Bernardin says . <p> " Which has been driven by a friend of hers named Malcolm ? " <p> " Malcolm Prescott . A friend of hers and mine , and a fine photographer to boot . " <p> " I 'm sorry to hear he 's dead , " Torquist says . " Was he by any chance an older man . " <p> " My age , " Bernardin replies . " Middle fifties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . " <p> " Is that so ? " <p> " Oh , yes . And something similar to this has happened once before , when Ingrid was friends with a composer of music , a man in his sixties , who took her all the time to see foreign films , until one day while they were watching one together , he dropped dead , just like that , of a heart attack <p> During the rest of the way to the hospital , Torquist informs Bernardin that he is a cabinetmaker and that things are hard on the West Coast because the recession there has lingered . When they arrive at the hospital , he thanks Bernardin for picking him up at the airport and for his kindness to Maria . <p> Three days later , Bernardin is standing before Helena and Ryan and several dozen mourners on a cliff above the Great Outer Beach . It is an unseasonably cold day with a brisk northwest wind  --  the kind that migratory birds wait for at this time of year , before launching themselves toward the South Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops blowing , Helena will be taken back to the hospital , Maria will return to college , Ingrid Torquist will fly home with the sun , and Malcolm 's ashes will have mingled with the sand . <p> Bernardin waits as some elderly latecomers are helped across the dunes and listens to Malcolm 's voice , not as it came to him over the telephone the day after the dinner party in April , when he first met Ingrid , but as if it is being carried on the wind . " You wo n't believe what 's happened , " Malcolm says . " D' you remember the woman I once told you about , the one in the bikini down by the pier that time , twenty years ago , when I came by in the Buick convertible and called out to her how beautiful she was , who slid herself onto the hood and sat there like some figurehead on the prow of a ship while I drove slowly through the whole damn town and out to the beach ? Well .. <p> The wind is blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout if he is to be heard above it . <p>
