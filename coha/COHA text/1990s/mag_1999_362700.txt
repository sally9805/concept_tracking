The brass at DaimlerChrysler have finally decided to re-enter the world of stock-car racing . The German-American automaker will announce this week that it is offering a car with a Chrysler engine and a Dodge body to NASCAR teams . The old Chrysler Corp . dropped out of stock-car racing when the company slashed its motor-sports program in the 1970s in an effort to save money . It is no secret in Detroit that representatives from NASCAR have been wooing Dodge for years in hope that the addition of another big all-American nameplate will help make the Winston Cup series even more popular . With NASCAR events routinely outdrawing basketball , baseball and ice hockey on network and cable television , DaimlerChrysler officials believe the time has come to return to the track , putting aside those very ' 70s concerns about fuel economy and safety . <P>  --  By Joseph R.
