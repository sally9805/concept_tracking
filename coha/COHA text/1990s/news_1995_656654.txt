<p> ON a cold gray Tuesday in late October , David Rohde reached the limit of his endurance . Since his capture by Bosnian Serb police three days earlier , The Christian Science Monitor reporter had been herded at gunpoint , threatened with death , and forced to stand through the night while a guard toyed ominously with handcuffs . After 48 hours of questioning with virtually no sleep , he had been given one hour to admit he was a spy . Otherwise , the police said vaguely , " He will come for you . " <p> " He " was a man Rohde had last seen playing with a knife , who asked the interrogator when Rohde was going to be sent to a prisoner-of-war camp . <p> " I just flipped out , " Rohde remembers . Left with a guard who seemed sympathetic , he began sobbing , disoriented with fear . <p> " I do n't care , " Rohde told the guard in broken Serbian . " I 'll say anything . If I just keep saying I 'm not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The guard leaned over a battered desk that was the only real furniture in the tiny interrogation room . " I know you 're a journalist . Do n't say you 're a spy , " he whispered . " They wo n't free you . You 'll have a big , big problem . " <p> With that hurried advice from a man who was supposed to be his jailer , Rohde was pulled back from the brink , and perhaps from a bullet . " That guy saved my life , " says Rohde , now safely back in America . " No doubt in my mind . " <p> Journalists are n't supposed to become part of the news they cover . David Rohde did , through no choice of his own . When he drove out of Sarajevo in a rented red Citroen on Oct. 29 , he was in search of one of the biggest stories yet to come out of the brutal Bosnian war : evidence that rebel Bosnian Serb soldiers had carried out the worst massacre in Europe since the Holocaust . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a rifle and a dog . <p> Rohde was held in an isolated police station for five days , then dispatched to prison like a thief . Threatened with espionage charges and possible execution , he was released only after blunt threats from high US officials and a massive international pressure campaign . <p> His full story , related in a four-hour monologue , is one of ambition and moral choice , comedy and danger , paranoia and obsession . Most of all it is about the agony of a war that has raged for years and killed thousands of people , yet for many in the West remains dimly seen lightning in the distance . <p> Some of Rohde 's captors treated him cruelly . Many did not - and seemed themselves ordinary men imprisoned in a war of others ' making . " It sounds ridiculous and trite , " Rohde says , " but I think that if you can get rid of the extremists and stabilize the situation for a while , these people can live together in peace . " <p> Danger and opportunity <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes correspondent . Quiet , intense , and usually clad in khakis , he instead resembles an apprentice architect or a college instructor on the verge of tenure . He came to the Monitor in 1994 , after stints at ABC News and the Philadelphia Inquirer , and impressed superiors with his seriousness and dedication . In October 1994 , he was offered a plum post - coverage of the corner of Europe that used to be Yugoslavia . <p> To reporters , the Balkans conflict is this generation 's Vietnam . That means it is an assignment of great danger and correspondingly great opportunity . Years of tragic war have produced human stories that grip the heart : a Sarajevo cellist playing on a street corner , defying snipers to stop his Bach ; a hollow-eyed Bosnian Serb guerrilla recounting techniques for slitting throats ; children playing in the rubble of what was once the Yugoslav national library . The fighting has also exacted a journalistic toll . More than 40 news professionals have died covering fighting in the Balkans . <p> Pressure and proximity have made the international press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rohde entered this world he did not stay unknown for long . <p> In the late summer of 1995 he landed a valuable prize : a pass into Bosnian Serb-held territory . The Bosnian Serbs , self-styled rulers of the " Republic of Srpska , " are often accused by the West of being the main villains in Bosnia 's dismemberment ; they have returned this charge with a sullen suspicion that can bloom into paranoia about Western plots . They admit few US reporters , and tightly control where reporters go and whom they interview . Rohde may have received his pass simply because he had not yet had the opportunity to annoy them . <p> Traveling through Srpska in August , the Monitor reporter searched for , and found , a field that US intelligence had identified as a mass grave of murder victims , Muslim refugees killed after their enclave of Srebrenica was overrun by Bosnian Serb attacks . In a detailed report last August , Rohde wrote of the sad personal papers from Srebrenica he discovered , and a human leg protruding from the earth . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also an act that begged follow-up . He was at the forefront of the story of Srebrenica 's fate , and that was where he intended to stay . <p> But ambition is only half the reason David Rohde searched again for killing fields . Guilt , and a sense of moral necessity , made up the other half . In September , he traveled to the town of Tuzla in northeastern Bosnia to interview Muslim refugees who had escaped the Srebrenica area . Many asked him if he knew anything about the fate of their uncles , brothers , husbands , or sons . He could n't answer most of them and haltingly told them news he had heard of executions of their relatives . The West 's interest in Srebrenica atrocities seemed to be declining - and at the same time Rohde knew there were further possible mass graves to be explored . <p> " I could n't go face these people who had survived Srebrenica and know that I knew there were four more massacres out there , and that I knew how to get to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them because US-based intelligence officials had told him the precise locations of four new graves . Rohde had in his possession a map of eastern Bosnia and had marked the exact locations of the four other mass graves . On the evening of Wednesday , Oct. 25 , he sat at a dinner with his fellow reporters in Zagreb , Croatia , gradually withdrawing from conversation . A plan was forming . He felt he had to go . " I felt sick to my stomach , " he now admits . <p> The first thing he needed was accreditation to pass from the government-held Bosnian capital of Sarajevo into territory controlled by rebel Bosnian Serbs . Bosnian Serb press officials , based in the nearby town of Pale , were not about to give him one , so he resorted to forgery . He took an old accreditation - a piece of cardboard that resembled a library card more than a passport - and simply drew over the relevant dates . On Friday , Oct. 27 , he traveled to Austria and rented a car . ( The rental contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra jerrycans for gas and film for his camera . By Saturday , Rohde was in Sarajevo . <p> Things go wrong <p> On Saturday night , Rohde talked by phone with Faye Bowers , his Monitor editor in Boston , and told her that he was n't going to file a story on the Dayton peace talks until Monday . He did n't tell her that he was in Sarajevo , and that he was going back to the Srebrenica area . Rohde told his editor that he had sent an electronic message to her at work explaining what he was up to . " I was n't comfortable lying to Faye , " he says . " But I did n't want her to feel any responsibility for the trip . " <p> For a few hours , he briefly considered taking a friend who writes for The New York Times . He decided against it - if the Times got the story , no one would notice his , even if it ran a day or so earlier . And it was n't fair to have his friend make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story until after Rohde 's ran . <p> So on Sunday morning , Oct. 29 , a very nervous David Rohde drove his rented red Citroen to the Sarajevo airport , passed a UN checkpoint , and reached the checkpoint entrance to Bosnian Serb territory . Rohde said he was headed for the press center in Pale . <p> " The checkpoint guard goes , ' Great , let me come with you , ' " remembers Rohde , " Which is the first thing that goes wrong . " <p> Rohde insisted he knew where he was going . The guard opened the passenger door . He said again , louder , that he needed no direction . The guard said " OK , " shut the door , and waved the Monitor reporter through to Serb territory . <p> For a while , events then proceeded according to plan . " I drive through Pale . I 'm sweating like a pig . Then I 'm relaxing , I 'm getting more confident . Things are going well , " Rohde says . <p> An hour out of Pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad sign . There were n't supposed to be so many checkpoints . Road control inside Bosnian Serb territory was supposed to be loose because of the new cease-fire - or so the Western press corps had believed . Once again Rohde proffered his falsified credential . <p> " And the cop says something to me , and then I figured out from his Serbian that he was asking , ' Can you give these guys a ride ? " ' <p> It was unavoidable - the reporter on a clandestine mission had to take a hitchhiking soldier . This was a problem . Rohde had a camera and film , which , if accidentally discovered , might attract more than mere idle comment . <p> But the ride proceeded apace , with Rohde 's passenger believing the reporter 's story that he was just in transit to Belgrade , the capital of Serbia . The pair passed time chatting about the prospects for peace , and the soldier debarked at a checkpoint in Nova Kasaba . <p> This was , ironically , the site of the one killing field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I see the old graves , and they 're pretty grown over , " says Rohde . " I thought about stopping . But then I decided , ' Do n't be stupid - new sites are what matters . ' " <p> A sign that says ' war zone ' <p> At that point , Rohde remembers , he went to plan " B. " There were too many checkpoints around , too many policemen . He 'd hoped to visit all four new graves in a day , and then proceed over the Drina River into Serbia and relative safety . Clearly , that was not going to be possible . He decided to visit only two alleged massacre sites that were near the town of Karakaj . These sites were far from any line of retreat that Bosnian Muslim soldiers would have taken as they fought their way out of Srebrenica . That meant that any mass graves in the area would likely be filled with the bodies of civilians - not battle casualties as the Serbs said . And Rohde had five detailed eyewitness accounts from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Just south of Karakaj , Rohde remembers , he reached down and loaded his camera . At first , he turned down the wrong road . He pulled up to a sign that said " War Zone " and turned around ; if he ran into a patrol of soldiers now he was likely to be shot . Then he found the right ul day with farmers working in the fields nearby . " <p> Rohde remembers that he went into a sort of shock . He took out his camera and snapped away , aware that he could be arrested at any moment . He took pictures of shoes and canes , and piles of clothing . He found berets , an identity card from Srebrenica , and personal photos with Muslim names on them . He found no bodies or bones , but one of the graves reeked of rotting flesh . He searched for hours . " I 'm there way too long , " Rohde says . <p> By then it was around 3 in the afternoon . After taking more shots of a nearby school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that perhaps he should leave . A young boy had stood in the middle of the road , staring at his license plate . He could be across the Drina in minutes . But he decided on a quick visit to the next Karakaj site , near a dam about 20 minutes away . It was crucial that the breadth of the killing - as many as 3,000 people executed - be proved . <p> ' Get away from the car ' <p> Rohde missed the first turn for the dam , too . He turned around and went on , safe in the knowledge that off the main roads there were no police checkpoints , and found the dam easily enough . He parked in a large graveled area . He walked around the area , then up a bluff to a dam . Nothing . He saw an old man walking his dog , who waved . Rohde waved back . At that point , he was discouraged . He got in the Citroen and drove to a second graveled area . He parked , looked to his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rohde quickly loaded his camera , relieved to be done . This was all he would need . He opened the door . " And I step out of the car , and the old man yells . I look out , and he 's standing there with the dog and a big rifle . And he says , ' Get away from the car ! Put your hands up ! ' " <p> Rohde would soon be in the hands of Bosnian Serb security . It was Sunday , Oct. 29 , about 5 or 6 in the afternoon . " I spent many hours in my cell wondering if these two femurs were worth it , " he says . <p> Faye Bowers , the Monitor editor who handles Bosnia stories , arrived at her desk in the Boston newsroom on Sunday at 6:30 a.m . She checked her electronic mail and found a message from David Rohde telling her the truth about where he had gone and what he was looking for . She was worried immediately . Rohde 's first grave-site excursion had been dangerous , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in alone , and the Bosnian Serbs had been furious at his first grave story . The paper 's higher-ups were n't going to be happy . <p> * First in a three-part series . Monday , five days of interrogation .
