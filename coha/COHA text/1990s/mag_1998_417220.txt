Although his palette consists of just six hues and a basic white , John O. Encinias ' lush canvases capture all the subtleties of color that he sees in his subjects . <p> Ask Colorado oil painter John O. Encinias what colors he mixes to get a particular result , and he will tell you , " Blue , red , and yellow . " Indeed , when it comes to color , his philosophy is simple . " Almost everything you paint is going to have the three primaries in it , " says the artist , " so understanding them will make your color sense stronger , and everything you mix will help you see these tones more . " <p> Encinias restricts his palette to a warm and cool version of each of the three primaries . " Cadmium yellow medium is warm , cadmium yellow light is cool ; cadmium red light is warm , alizarin is cool ; and ultramarine blue is warm , compared to the cooler cobalt blue , " he explains . With these six colors plus white , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , warm or cool , in any value . <p> " As painters , we train our eyes to decipher all the subtleties in the subject we 're painting , " he says . " You can represent anything you see with this palette . " <p> For instance , when mixing a yellow ochre , he begins with yellow , the primary . He then adds red , along with a touch of blue to tone it down . To create a raw sienna , he adds a bit more red to it . Using the two yellows on this palette , he can also adjust the coolness or warmth . And to emphasize sunlight on grass , the artist mixes the warmer yellow with the warmer blue , and then adds some of the warmer red . <p> Encinias begins by using his keen sense of color to identify various hues . " If I 'm working on a land-scape , I 'll ask , What color is the sky ? ' Then I 'll start with one of the blues , add some yellow to it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the ground , I 'll start with the red , maybe , add some of the blue , and then add a pinch of yellow to warm it up . And for the trees , I might start with blue and yellow , and then add a little bit of the red . " <p> This process was n't always easy for Encinias . When he first started painting outdoors , he admits he was less sensitive to the nuances of color in nature . " I saw a branch as just a branch , " he recalls . " I was using a lot of timbers because I just did n't know what to do with color . And as a result , I 'd come back with all these dirty little paintings . " <p> But once he became more receptive to the hues before him , he was able to clean up his canvases . " Now , I can see that a branch is made up of a lot of different colors . Nature provides us with so much color to work with  --  we just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows him to create paintings that reflect the beauty that others might overlook . In some situations , bleak weather may obscure the color of a landscape , such as in the painting Winter Grays . Encinias did a 12 " - x- 16 " field study for this painting near his Denver home on an early February morning . " It was still cloudy , but the lights was breaking , " he says . " Even within those grays , there was a lot of color in the rocks and grass . Some people think that on a cloudy day there is n't going to be any color . It 's definitely there  --  it 's just subdued . " <p> Encinias also notes that each spot of color is affected by the hues around it . For instance , a tree trunk with an ochre cast in winter will start to appear more violet in spring because of the greens surrounding it . " Nature does this so beautifully , " he says . " You really have to see how the light affects an object at a particular time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light and you mix it according to the color and temperature , it still may not be right until you put it against the colors already on the canvas and adjust it . " Shaking his head , he adds , " I see some people working on just one spot of the painting , and they ca n't get that one color right because everything around it is wrong . <p> " To me , color is an illusion , " he continues . " If you have an orange against a red , it wo n't be as intense as it would be against a blue , its complement . You can brighten a color by using complementary colors around it . If it gets too intense and you want to tone it down , just put a touch of the complement in it . " <p> Compared to other artists who use a lot of hold colors , Encinias says he tends toward the neutral . " My colors are softer because that 's the way I see nature , or light , " he explains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a still life in the studio , with natural northern light  --  a very cool , hut soft , light  --  the shadows are soft , too . " <p> Outdoors , Encinias works quickly to capture the effect of light . For instance , in the 12 " - x- 16 " field study for the painting Evening Sky , the clouds are the primary feature and needed to be established right away . " I had about half an hour , " he says . " But if you know your palette very well , you 'll know exactly how to get where you 're going in a matter of minutes . And to capture some things in nature , you often need to move fast . " <p> The way the light strikes the top of the roof and the top of the rocks in Evening Sky is an example of subtle things that the camera ca n't capture . " Once you learn what the light does outdoors , then you can take a photograph and know basically what you 're doing , " says the artist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's still no substitute for being out there and seeing it yourself . " <p> Only when he has all the information on his canvas does Encinias begin to refine certain areas . " The most difficult part is not over-refining it , " he says . " I work back and forth until I feel that I 've captured the light and color . The details can be adjusted later in the studio . " <p> For the field study of Evening Sky , the artist made only small adjustments . " That little barn was n't actually there , but to the right of me . Later on , however , that spot was just too empty , " he recalls . " You could still see the main effect , the clouds , but the painting did n't have the feeling I wanted . Putting the dark shape of the barn in there was just an afterthought . " <p> And Encinias is pleased with the result . " I like the bottom section a lot , " he says . " The design is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sky . The reason for composing a painting is n't just to zap you in and out . Rather , it should keep you there , letting you wander around and enjoy it .
