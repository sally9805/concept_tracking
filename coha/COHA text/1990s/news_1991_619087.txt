<p> The crippling Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 and the devastating East Bay hills fire in October have focused attention on one of the most complex issues facing disaster planners and the public : What is the price of safety ? With all the destructive power that nature can unleash , should local communities spend more on preparedness ? Or , as some critics contend , are zealous officials bleeding businesses and homeowners to death with excessive safety mandates ? <p> The issue is far from academic . In the matter of earthquakes alone , tens of billions of dollars are at stake , both in potential seismic losses and in the cost of retrofitting buildings . As cities across the country begin considering California-style building standards , the weighing of costs and benefits has become an urgent matter of public policy . <p> Yet the question of too much or too little remains largely unanswered . Few cities have had the resources , analytical tools or hard data to undertake anything but the most primitive review of their preparedness programs . <p> The same is true at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with little analysis and sparse data " to support them , according to Thomas Tobin , executive director of the state 's Seismic Safety Commission . Instead of dispassionate investigation , he said , " policies are formed by the often conflicting pulls and tugs of interested parties , whose concerns may be limited to a very small portion of the overall problem . " <p> This messy process of competition and compromise can produce a sensible outcome if the players have all the facts and take the long view . But with everything about earthquakes open to doubt , from their size and impact to their timing , public policy usually hinges less on expert opinion than on the narrow and often opposing incentives of safety regulators , property owners and politicians . <p> When policymakers do step back from the fray long enough to study the relationship of costs to benefits , they gain vital insights into how best to ensure the public 's safety . <p> If retrofitting old buildings costs 10 times as much per life saved as investing in stronger water mains for fighting fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former . And if some measure throws 10,000 people out of work for every life it saves , the public may not accept the price . <p> Most earthquake experts believe that , partly by luck , California cities are roughly on track in their approach to earthquake preparedness . <p> " I would be confident that the ratio of benefits to costs would be very high " for current standards , said Bob Olson , a Sacramento consultant who just completed a two- year project for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help cities analyze the merits of various retrofit proposals . " It 's darn worthwhile to make buildings meet the standards we have now . " <p> If anything , some analysts say , California may be too slow in setting safety standards for concrete buildings erected before the 1970s , which pose a real risk of " pancaking " on their occupants . Instead the state has focused too exclusively on unreinforced masonry structures , according to Leo Levenson , an Albany earthquake consultant . <p> DANGERS IN OTHER STATES <p> More surprising is the finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investing enough in their own safety , running the risk of catastrophic losses . <p> Faults near Memphis , St. Louis , Salt Lake City , the Puget Sound area in Washington , Boston , Charleston , S.C. , and New York City could cause property damage of $ 50 billion and indirect losses  --  from business disruption and workers ' compensation  --  of three times that amount , according to Elliott Mittler of the University of California at Los Angeles ' Anderson Graduate School of Management . <p> In Eastern cities , the lack of seismic building codes , the close packing of fire-prone wood houses and poor-quality soils " are a disaster waiting to happen , " said Eugene Lecomte , president of the National Committee on Property Insurance , based in Boston . " We have n't been engaged in preparedness as long as California . " <p> Robert Litan , an economist at the Brookings Institution , just finished a detailed study of building code proposals in Memphis and Los Angeles . Looking only at property damage , he found that tougher codes for new buildings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be even more cost-effective than in Los Angeles . <p> Yet this kind of careful calculus is the exception when it comes to making policy ; political and bureaucratic squabbles are the rule . <p> DRUMBEATERS FOR SAFETY <p> In California , numerous agencies exist to promote earthquake and general disaster preparedness , from the Seismic Safety Commission and state Office of Emergency Services to the U.S. Geological Survey . Their job , while not losing sight of costs , is to beat the drums for more and more safety measures . <p> The safety bureaucrats enjoy support from officials who know that the public will look for scapegoats when disaster does strike . " If there 's an earthquake , and buildings tumble and people are hurt , we 'll all be held accountable , " said Assemblyman Rusty Areias , a Salinas Democrat and a leading advocate of greater preparedness . <p> Or as California Department of Transportation spokesman Jim Drago put it , " If we err , we err on the side of safety . " <p> Strongly countering such tendencies are the resistance of property owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uncertain disasters ; the reality that numerous other pressing concerns compete for public dollars ; and the fact that many politicians have an attention span extending no further than the next election . <p> " I ca n't sit here and tell you in good conscience that earthquake preparedness is the best or most important priority that we have , " said Areias . " We have immediate crises taking place in individuals ' lives and communities every day , problems of prenatal care , mental health and homelessness . " <p> ' THE LARGEST PUBLIC PARK ' <p> Compounding these factors is the reluctance of most people to admit the magnitude of the catastrophe that could hit their communities . " We do n't want to face the facts , " said Gladys Hansen , co-author of Denial of Disaster , a study of the 1906 earthquake . " If we did , San Francisco would be the largest public park in the state of California . " <p> In fact , public denial may be the single biggest deterrent to sensible planning and investment in preparedness . Lidia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , calls her state " a marvel of stupidity " for allowing expensive , highrise residential and commercial development on the most slide-prone sites in Anchorage , including some parcels that moved as much as 11 feet in 1964 . " In the early years , people took risks seriously , but over time people forgot and politics took over , " Selkregg said . <p> What may save California from a similar fate , many experts point out , is the very frequency of its earthquakes . The earth rolls often enough in this state to remind voters and policymakers of the need for adequate preparations . <p> DANGERS OF FADING MEMORIES <p> But in cities like Memphis , which last suffered an earthquake in 1812 , no one alive today has any sense of the danger . " As memories fade , so does the sense of urgency about disaster preparedness , " said Ted Glickman , a senior risk analyst at Resources for the Future , a Washington think tank . <p> Legitimate cost issues further tilt the debate , particularly when regulations threaten to put people out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealer in a potentially vulnerable masonry building , argues that proposed city retrofit standards will wipe out a host of unique , small businesses that give San Francisco its charm . <p> " How safe can you practically make a city ? " he asks . " It 's not possible to remove all the danger unless you tear down all the buildings , which would destroy our architectural heritage . And in the midst of recession , we do n't have excess millions to do it . If they pass a law that 's too strong , nothing will get done anyway . " <p> In Oakland , many earthquake- damaged buildings still sit empty , their owners unable to afford city- mandated upgrades . Other buildings are at risk of closing because of tighter city standards now under consideration . <p> " You get real economic problems with retrofitting , " said Assistant City Manager Ezra Rapport . " Many buildings are bordering on obsolescence anyway . If required to retrofit , rents will not support them , and they will become vacant . " <p> Such mandated retrofits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Small businesses may have to relocate during periods of construction , and tenants may be forced to pay higher rents as landlords pass along their costs  --  although some may accept the disruption in exchange for a more durable home . <p> S.F. ANALYSIS <p> San Francisco recently analyzed such considerations in a pioneering study of how far to strengthen its unreinforced masonry buildings . Examining five options of varying toughness , it explored their direct costs , the indirect costs of disrupting tenants during construction and the likely savings of lives and property in an earthquake . <p> From that study , a city team chose a combination of standards that produced the most safety for the buck . <p> " This was a ground-breaking study , " said Paul Deutsch in the City Planning Department . " I do n't know of anyone else who 's gone as far as San Francisco in looking at the costs , benefits and impacts of the unreinforced masonry building retrofit program . " <p> Still , even this comprehensive review made no attempt to compare whether more lives could be saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ideally , you should look across various public safety programs at the number of lives saved per dollar , " Deutsch conceded . <p> But according to consultant Levenson , the reality is that " it 's easy to for studies , but very difficult to do them . We just do n't have good data . " <p> BC <p> CHART : SAN EARTHQUAKE EARTHQUAKE SAFETY COST <p> . <p> San Francisco has more than 2,000 unreinforced masonry buildings that could substain significant damage in a major earthquake .
