" Chapter 1 " &lt; Colonel Harrison read the letter a second time , then leaned back in his chair and smiled . The answer to a prayer , he thought . That was the only way to describe the letter : the answer to a prayer . Just to make sure it did indeed say what he thought it did , he looked at the letter again . General Yovington had issued orders from Washington , D.C. , that Lieutenant L. K. Surrey was to leave the post of Company J , Second Dragoons , for a special assignment . But since Lieutenant Surrey had died just last week , Colonel Harrison would have to choose someone to take the assignment in his place . Colonel Harrison 's smile grew broader . He was choosing Captain C. H. Montgomery to take Lieutenant Surrey 's place . The lieutenant , now replaced by Captain Montgomery , was " requested " to escort a foreign opera singer into the gold fields of the Colorado Territory . He was to remain with her and her small band of musicians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to protect her from any dangers she would possibly encounter on her journey and to do what he could to make her travels more comfortable . Colonel Harrison put the letter down , handling it as though it were a precious relic , and smiled so broadly his face nearly cracked . Lady 's maid , he thought . The high and mighty Captain : Montgomery was being ordered to be nothing more than a lady 's maid . But , more important , Captain Montgomery was being ordered away from Fort Breck . Colonel Harrison took a few deep , cleansing breaths and thought about having his own fort to command , and about not having to deal with the perfection , the cool knowledge of Captain Montgomery . No longer would the men look to their captain for confirmation of every order , for permission to do : what their colonel asked of them . Colonel Harrison thought back to when he first came to Fort Breck a year ago . His predecessor , Colonel Collins , had been a drunken , lazy old fool . Collins 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of Indian country and go back to Virginia , where people lived in a civilized manner . He was content to turn over all responsibility to his second-in-command , Captain Montgomery . And why not ? Montgomery 's record had to be seen to be believed . He 'd been in the army since he was eighteen , and in the ensuing eight years he 'd worked himself up through the ranks . He 'd started as a private , and , after extraordinary heroism on the field of battle , he 'd been made an officer . He 'd gone from second lieutenant to captain in a mere three years , and at the rate he was going he 'd outrank Colonel Harrison in another few years . Not that the man did n't deserve everything he 'd ever earned in the army . No , as far as Colonel Harrison could tell , Captain Montgomery was perfect . He was cool under fire , never losing his head . He was generous , fair , and understanding with the enlisted men , and as a result they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to him with their problems ; the officers ' ladies fawned over him and asked his advice about social events . Captain Montgomery did n't drink , did n't patronize the whores outside the fort ; he 'd never lost his temper as far as anyone knew , and he could do anything . He could ride like a demon and , while at a full gallop , shoot the eye out of a turkey from a hundred yards away . He knew Indian sign language and a smattering of several Indian languages . Hell , even the Indians liked him , said he was a man they could respect and trust . No doubt Captain Montgomery would die before he broke his word . Everyone in the world seemed to like , honor , respect , even revere Captain Montgomery . Everyone , that is , except Colonel Harrison . Colonel Harrison loathed the man . Not just disliked him , not just hated him , but loathed him . Everything the captain could do that the colonel could n't made the colonel despise him more . The enlisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Harrison did n't know anything about the West , and the truth was , this was the first time in his life the colonel had been west of the Mississippi . Captain Montgomery had n't volunteered to help the colonel learn the ropes ; no , he was much too polite for that , but , in the end the colonel had had to ask him some questions . The captain had always known the answer , always known the best way to settle any dispute . It was after Colonel Harrison had been at Fort Breck for five months that he began to hate the man who had all the answers . Of course , having a sixteen-year-old daughter who practically swooned at the sight of the man , did n't help matters . Colonel Harrison 's resentment had come to a head one hot morning the previous summer when , in a vile mood , the colonel had ordered a man who had done no more than oversleep reveille to be punished with twenty lashes . He was sick unto death of the drunkenness of his men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignored the looks of hatred from the other men , but his stomach began to hurt . He was n't a bad man ; be just wanted to enforce discipline at his post . When Captain Montgomery stepped forward to protest the punishment , Colonel Harrison saw red . He informed the captain that he was in charge of the fort , and unless the captain meant to take the man 's punishment , he was to stay out of this . It was n't until Montgomery began removing his jacket that the colonel realized what he meant to do . It was the worst morning of the colonel 's life , and he dearly wished he could go back to bed and start the day over . Captain Montgomery  --  the fearless , perfect Captain Montgomery took all twenty of the man 's lashes . For a while the colonel thought he was going to have a mutiny on his hands when all the enlisted men refused to wield the whip . In the end a second lieutenant applied the whip to Montgomery 's broad back , and when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned on the colonel , his eyes blazing with hatred . " Anything else ... sir ? " he 'd asked , sneering the last word . For two weeks hardly anyone on the post spoke to the colonel  --  including his own wife and daughter . As for the captain , he was back on duty the next morning without so much as a grimace of pain for a back that must have been killing him . That he would n't even commit himself to the infirmary for a few days was the last straw . From that day on , Colonel Harrison did n't even bother trying to conceal his loathing for the captain . Of course the captain never once betrayed what he felt for the colonel ; no , perfect human beings like Montgomery do n't give away what they feel . He just continued to be the perfect officer a friend to the men , a charming escort to the ladies . A man trusted by all . A man who , as far as Colonel Harrison could tell , had no feelings . A man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . A man who never tripped on his horse 's stirrup or missed whatever he was aiming to shoot . A man who would probably smile in the face of death . But now , Colonel Harrison thought , now he was going to get rid of this perfect man . Now General Yovington had requested an escort for some opera singer through gold country , and he was going to send the illustrious Captain Montgomery . " I hope she 's fat , " the colonel said aloud . " I hope she 's real fat . " " Sir ? " his corporal asked from his desk on the other side of the room . " Nothing , " the colonel barked . " Send Captain Montgomery to me , then leave us . " The colonel ignored the look the corporal gave him . Promptly , as always , Captain Montgomery appeared and the colonel tried to keep from frowning . There was n't a speck of dust on the captain 's dark blue uniform , which he suspected had been privately tailored to fit the captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir ? " Captain Montgomery asked , standing at attention . Colonel Harrison wondered if the man could slump . " I have orders for you from General Yovington . Ever hear of him ? " " Yes , sir . " What had the colonel expected , that Montgomery did n't know the answer to something ? He rose from behind his desk , put his hands behind his back , and began to walk about the room . He must try to keep the joy from his voice . " As you know , General Yovington is a very important man and he has reasons for what he does . He does not allow people like you and me to know those reasons , but then , you and I are mere soldiers and ours is to obey , not to question the reason behind an order . " He looked at the captain . There was no impatience on his face , no annoyance , just that calm look he always wore . Perhaps the colonel could break that perfect calm . He 'd give a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonel went to the desk and picked up the letter . " I received this by special courier this morning . It seems to be of utmost importance . The general , for whatever reasons , seems to have formed an , ah ... attachment to an opera singer and now that ... lady wants to sing for the gold miners . He wants her to have an army escort . " The colonel looked hard at Captain Montgomery , his eyes wide , for he did n't want to miss the man 's reaction . " The general requested Lieutenant Surrey , but as you well know , the poor unfortunate man wo n't be able to make it , therefore I 've thought long and hard about a suitable replacement , and I have chosen you , Captain . " Colonel Harrison almost did a little jump of joy when Montgomery blinked twice and then tightened his lips . " You 're to keep her out of trouble , see that the Indians do n't bother her , keep the miners from making advances toward her , see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's she 's fed and that her bath water 's hot and  --  " " I respectfully decline the assignment , sir , " Captain Montgomery said , his back straight , his eyes straight ahead , which was some inches over the colonel 's graying head . Colonel Harrison 's heart swelled . " This is not a request , it 's an order . You are not being asked , you are being told . It is not an invitation you can refuse . " To the colonel 's astonishment , Montgomery dropped his rigid posture and , without being given permission , he sat down in a chair , then withdrew a thin cigar from inside his jacket . " An opera singer ? What the hell do I know about an opera singer ? " The colonel knew he should reprimand the captain for sitting without permission , but if he 'd learned nothing else in the last year , he 'd at least learned that the western army was not like in the East , where discipline was understood . Besides , he was enjoying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come now , Captain , you can figure it out . Who better than you ? Why , in all my twenty years of service I 've never seen a man with a better record . Commissioned on the field of battle , an indispensable right-hand man to any officer . You 've fought Indians and whites , You 've rounded up outlaws and renegades . You 're a man 's man and yet you can advise the ladies on how to set a table , and according to what I hear from the ladies , you dance divinely . " He smiled when Captain Montgomery gave him a malevolent look . He had n't broken that facade even on the day he 'd taken the twenty lashes for the private . " What 's Yovington to her ? " " General Yovington did n't make me his confidant . He merely sent his orders . You 're to leave in the morning . As far as I can tell , the woman has already reached the mountains on her own . You 'll recognize her by ... " He picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She 's traveling in a modified Concord wagon . It 's red and it has , ah ... let 's see , the name LaReina painted on the side . LaReina is the woman 's name . I hear she 's very good . At singing , I mean . I do n't know what else she 's good at besides singing . The general did n't tell me that . " " She 's traveling in a stagecoach ? " " A red one . " Colonel Harrison permitted himself a small smile . " Oh , come now , Captain , surely this is n't a bad assignment . Think how this will look on your record . Think where this could lead . If you perform this duty well , you could start escorting generals ' daughters . I 'm sure my own daughter would give you a recommendation . " Abruptly , Captain Montgomery stood . " With all due respect , sir , I can not do this . There is too much unrest now and I am needed elsewhere . There are white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the possibility of war , I do not believe I can desert my post to  --  " Colonel Harrison lost his sense of humor . " Captain , this is not a request . This is an order . Whether you like it or not , you are on an assignment of indefinite length . You are to stay with this woman as long as she wants , go wherever she wants , do whatever needs to be done , even if it is no more than pull her coach out of the mud . If you do n't do this , I will slap you in jail , court-martial you , find you guilty , and have you shot , And if I have to , I 'll pull the trigger myself . Is that understood ? Do I make myself clear ? " " Very clear , sir , " Captain Montgomery answered tightly . " All right , then , go and pack . You 're to leave at dawn tomorrow . " The colonel watched as the captain seemed to be trying to say something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toby , " was all the captain could get out through a jaw tight with anger . So , the captain did have a temper , the colonel thought , and he was tempted to antagonize him further by insisting that the orders had not included the garrulous , scrawny little private who was never more than a few feet from the captain 's side . But the colonel remembered too well the anger of the enlisted men the day the captain had taken an enlisted man 's lashes . " Take him , " the colonel said . " He 'll be of no use here . " The captain nodded his thanks but did n't speak them as he turned on his heel and left the colonel 's office . After the captain was gone , the colonel sank onto his hard chair and let out a sigh of relief , but at the same time he was a little nervous . Could he control this unruly fort , where most of the " soldiers " were farmers who 'd signed up merely to fill their bellies ? Half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desertion was rampant . For the last year his record had been excellent , but he knew that was due a great deal to Captain Montgomery . Could he rule the fort on his own ? " Damn him ! " he said , and slammed a desk drawer shut in anger . Of course he could command his own fort ! ' Ring Montgomery stared at the woman through the spyglass for a long moment , then angrily slammed it closed . " That her ? " Toby asked from behind him . " You sure she 's the one ? " He was a foot shorter than ' Ring , wiry , and had skin the color of walnut juice . " How many other women would be fool enough to travel alone to a town of forty thousand men ? " Toby took the spyglass and looked through it . They were standing on a hill looking down into a pretty valley where a bright new red stagecoach sat , glittering in the setting sun , a tent not far away . In front of the coach was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner while a thin , blonde woman served her . Toby lowered the glass . " What d' you think she 's eatin ' ? It looks like somethin ' green on her plate . Do you think it 's peas ? Maybe string beans . Or is it just green meat like the army has ? " " I could n't care less what she 's eating . Damn Harrison ! Damn him to hell and back ! Incompetent bastard ! Just because he ca n't run a fort the size of Breck , he sends me off to do his dirty work . " Toby yawned . He 'd heard this a thousand times . He 'd been with ' Ring since ' Ring was a boy , and he might seem stoic to others but Toby knew the truth . " You ought a be thankin ' the man . He got us out of that godforsaken fort and put us out here where the gold 's ours to be had . " " We have an assignment , and I mean to fulfill it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army . " ' Ring started to remind Toby of the uniform he wore , but he knew it was a waste of breath . Toby had joined the army because ' Ring had and for no other reason . The purpose of the army , the work that needed to be done , meant nothing to Toby . But it meant everything to ' Ring . He 'd joined the army before his first beard had fully grown , and he 'd always tried to do his best , to always be fair , to see what needed to be done and do it . He 'd been quite successful and quite happy until last year , when Colonel Harrison had become his commanding officer . Harrison was an incompetent fool , a man who 'd never seen any action , a desk officer who had been sent west and had no idea what to do . He 'd dumped his anger at his own incompetency on his captain 's shoulders , making ' Ring take the blame for what the colonel could n't do . " She 's eatin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking through the spyglass . " You think it 's lettuce ? Maybe carrots . You think it 's somethin ' besides hardtack ? " " What the hell do I care what she 's eating ? " He walked away from the ridge . " We have to make a plan . First of all , she 's either a good woman or a bad one . If she 's good , she has no business being out here alone , and if she 's bad , she does n't need an escort . Either way , she has no need for me . " " What 's that say on her door ? " ' Ring paused in pacing and grimaced . " LaReina , the Singing Duchess . " He looked back down at the red coach . " Toby , we have to do something about this . We can not allow this young woman to go into the gold-mining area . I 'm sure she knows nothing about what she 's getting into , If she knew the many dangers she faced , I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her point of  --  ? " Toby said . " Origin . Where she came from . " " You know , I was just wonderin ' how she got this far by herself . You think she drove that coach herself ? " " Heavens , no ! A Concord is n't easy to drive . " " Then where are her drivers ? " " I do n't know , " ' Ring said , waving his hand in dismissal . " Perhaps they 've deserted her to work in the gold fields . Perhaps the woman will be grateful if I explain to her the hazards involved in a journey such as she 's planning . " " Humph ! " Toby snorted . " I ai n't never yet seen or heard tell of a woman that was grateful for anything . " ' Ring took the spyglass from Toby and looked through it again . " Look at her , sitting there calmly eating , and unless I miss my guess , that is very fine china she 's eating from . She does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a gold camp . " " She looks pretty fine to me . Big top on her . I like the top half to be big . And the bottom half , too , if the truth be told . I ca n't see her face from here . " " She 's an opera singer ! " ' Ring snapped . " She 's not a dance-hall girl . " " I see . Dance-hall girls sleep with miners and opera singers sleep with generals . " ' Ring glared at him and Toby glared back until ' Ring walked away . " All right , here 's the plan : We show her a little of what the West is really like , what she can expect in the camps . " " You ai n't plannin ' to use her for target practice , are you ? " " Of course not . I 'll just , maybe , well , scare her a little bit . Put some sense into her . " " Great , " Toby said with a sigh . " Then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That man 's gon na be as glad to see you as he would be to see a pack of Apaches . He do n't like you none at all . " " The feeling is mutual . Yes , we 'll return to Fort Breck , but I 'll put in for a transfer . " " Good . In four , five years we should be able to get out of the place . By then you ai n't gon na have no skin left on your back from tryin ' to play the hero and impress the men . " " It was something that had to be done , and I did it , " ' Ring said as though from rote , for he 'd said this a thousand times to Toby . " Like you got ta go scare this lady now , is that it ? How come you do n't just go tell her you do n't wanta ride around the gold fields with her ? " " It must be the woman 's decision to return to civilization . Otherwise , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " So maybe you 're plannin ' to scare her for yourself and not to save any of her skin . " " You have a very pessimistic outlook on life . It would be the best thing for both of us if she were to turn back . Now , are you coming with me or not ? " " I would n't miss this for the world . Maybe she 'll offer us somethin ' to eat , but I sure hope she do n't sing . I sure do hate opery . " ' Ring straightened his uniform , adjusted the heavy , long saber at his side . " Let 's get this over with . I have many things to do back at the fort . " " Like keepin ' ol ' man Harrison from killin ' you ? " ' Ring did n't answer as he mounted his horse .
