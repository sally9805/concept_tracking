The ceremony was rich with symbolism , but the circumstances were awkward , to say the least . Shortly after U.S. troops began to move , a new government was inaugurated with the aim of restoring democracy in Panama . The swearing-in took place at Fort Clayton , a U.S. military base , with only a few Panamanians present . After the new President , Guillermo Endara , and his two Vice Presidents , Guillermo Ford and Ricardo Arias Calderon , took their oath of office , they remained at the base for 36 hours . <P> Endara 's first words to his countrymen on Wednesday were broadcast not by Panamanian radio , which was still controlled by Noriega 's forces , but by Radio Impacto in Costa Rica , which had taped him by telephone . On Thursday the new President , under the protection of American soldiers , left the base for his first speech to the National Assembly . He pledged to lead " a government of reconstruction and reconciliation , " but by then his fledgling regime distinctly bore the label " Made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politician inherited a nation in the midst of chaos . A 250-lb. labor lawyer with little political experience before he ran for President in last May 's aborted election , Endara must rebuild a society that was seriously damaged by U.S. economic sanctions , then savaged by invasion and ravaged by looters . His support comes mostly from the white business and professional classes in Panama City ; he must win over the darker-skinned Panamanians of the barrios and the countryside  --  those who felt emboldened and empowered by Noriega 's populist anti-Yanqui tirades . <P> Endara will have to establish his legitimate claim to the Panamanian presidency over Francisco Rodriguez , whom Noriega picked after calling off the election last May . Rodriguez urged Panamanians to resist the U.S. troops , then disappeared . Endara had little international support last week , except from the U.S. Neither the United Nations nor the Organization of American States would accept his ambassadors . <P> Most foreign experts agree that Endara , the candidate of an eight-party anti-Noriega alliance , won the May presidential election over Carlos Duque . Noriega declared that election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Endara , Calderon and Ford were beaten by the pro-Noriega vigilante groups known as Dignity Battalions . Endara embarked on a two-week hunger strike to protest Rodriguez 's subsequent appointment . After last October 's failed coup attempt against Noriega , Endara went into hiding . " Nobody doubts ( ( his ) ) courage , " says a senior U.S. official , " but it 's a lot easier to get yourself beaten up than to put a country together from scratch . " <P> Endara might have an easier time if he were starting from scratch . His biggest challenge is to obtain the loyalty of the 12,000-strong Panama Defense Forces , a militia created and nurtured by Noriega and bent on its own survival . As the nation 's police force , the P.D.F . will be essential to maintaining order . But given the army 's continuing loyalty to Noriega and the rampant corruption within the officer corps , it is a breeding ground for future plots against any civilian government .                @ @ @ @ @
