Every day across Canada , hundreds of parents place phone calls ( to agents , casting directors , photographers ) that start like this : " I have a beautiful ( cute , talented ) son ( daughter , baby ) and everybody says he should be a model ( actor , star ) . How do I do it ? " If you 're thinking the same thing , pause for a moment before you make that call . Opportunities abound , it 's true . We see the sweet faces of children on magazine covers , bus shelters and diaper packages . In the booming film and television industry , the demand for child performers is huge  --  and growing . " I do n't think I 've done a project in the last two years that has n't had a child in it at some point , " says Vancouver casting director Stuart Aikins ( Legends of the Fall , Little Women ) . " At least 50 percent have a child under 12 or 13 as a major character . " And showbiz can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of a camera with Lamb Chop and Shari Lewis . When Langley , B.C. modelling hopeful Michelle Henshall , 17 , landed a Mattel commercial six years ago , she had the time of her life . " We just played , " she says . " And when it was over they gave me a bunch of free Barbies . " Financially , too , the rewards can be handsome . One good national commercial with residuals might bring in $4,000 to $5,000 ( which , wisely invested , could pay university tuition ) . Although most child actors in Canada are lucky to earn between $3,000 and $30,000 annually , a handful bring in $100,000 to $150,000 in a good year . Nathalie Gaulthier , a children 's talent agent with offices in Toronto and Montreal , reports that her top client made half a million dollars in 1994 . But it 's not just the money . " It teaches an enormous amount of discipline and confidence , " says Gaulthier , who started acting at age five in Montreal television . And industry jobs can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting  --  even famous  --  people . Beneath the razzmatazz , however , lies a hard reality . " Kids sell , " says Gaulthier bluntly . " Kids sell like crazy . It 's big bucks . " How big ? In the U.S. and Canada , Twentieth Century Fox has made $140 million on its 1990 surprise hit Home Alone . And that 's just box office profit alone . Its child star , Macaulay Culkin , reportedly demanded  --  and got  --  $5 million plus five percent of the gross on the sequel . This is a far cry from Johnny hamming it up on a home video . Parents enticed by the glamour of the entertainment industry should take a hard look before they start dialling for dollars . They call it show business Parents who want to put their kids in front of the camera have to understand that it is a business . If you want to be involved  --  even just so your little one can be in one photo layout in one Sears catalogue  --  you have to recognize that . Your job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ward , " is to know what the business is . " He admits that 's a problem for parents who are new to the industry . " But , you can learn , " he advises , " by talking to people in the business  --  actors , models , agents , parents , the unions . You can enroll in courses , read books , articles , trade magazines . " Gaulthier estimates that busy Toronto kids may go to as many as eight auditions a week , although the average may be three or four a month . Auditions may take two or three hours including travel time . Then if Johnny gets the job , count on at least an eight-hour call per day for movies and TV shoots , one-or two-hour calls for print modelling . If your child is going to be in the business , he will need at least one adult to support that decision by providing business and financial management , chauffeuring , chaperoning , wardrobe and a host of other services . And be prepared to help your child deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other words , being a stage parent can easily become a full-time job . Parents also have to know what is not their job . Acting coach or art director is not part of the job description . " The best kid actors are the ones who learn the part themselves and their parents do n't get involved at all , " says Aikins , who notes that kids who read early have a definite advantage in getting parts . Similarly , if your daughter is doing a photo shoot , do n't hover in the background telling her to smile . That 's the photographer 's job . An overzealous stage mom or dad can end a career before it begins . It 's also important to know the specific business you 're in . Stunningly beautiful Julie may be perfect for print modelling , but too pretty for TV commercials , where the kid-next-door look is what they 're after . And your ten-year-old 's ability to eat pizza like a pro in a 30-second spot does n't mean he 'll be right for the movies . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercials , " says Aikins . " They just have to know how to react . When they get into movieland , it 's a whole different style . " Watch out for the bad guys In any industry where there are fortunes to be made , you 'll find shysters and dream smashers . A lot of heartache can be avoided through education and common sense . For example : Although most industry experts agree that to work regularly , your child needs an agent for representation , Bruce Ward stresses that an agent ca n't get your child auditions or jobs . An agent only recommends clients to casting directors ( or photographers or art directors ) , and they decide who they want to see . Toronto actress Teresa Tova , familiar to TV-viewers as Marge on the now-cancelled E.N.G. , is the mother of two successful child performers , Tara and David Pearson ( ages nine and 11 ) . She is passionate when it comes to parents ' responsibilities . " You have to ask questions . That 's your job  --  to be a parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child will be OK . If you do n't ask questions , how can you safeguard your kids ? " You also have to safeguard your bank account . Tova chairs the children 's committee of the Alliance of Canadian Cinema , Television and Radio Artists ( ACTRA ) , Toronto performers branch . Recently she was contacted by a Toronto woman who had paid an unscrupulous entrepreneur a $300 " finder 's fee " to obtain a " hand-picked " agent for her child . The " finder " pocketed the cash , took a bad Polaroid of the little girl , and handed the mother a photocopied list of agents with one name highlighted . " This was her hand-picked agent . It was an agency that specialized in extras , " Tova says in disgust . Suspicious , the woman called the agency , did n't mention the finder , and easily got an appointment . " When she walked in the door , the agency wanted $400 from her to  --  get this  --  make her three-year-old a principal performer ! " says Tova , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make anybody a principal performer . " Michelle Henshall temporarily gave up modelling after a similar experience with a Vancouver agency . Along with several other Vancouver youngsters , Henshall paid her agent $3,000 and invested another $2,500 in clothes and photos to travel to New York for a modelling " showcase " three years ago . " I was hoping I 'd get some work out of it , meet some people , " she recalls . Instead , the girls were left on their own . They went to some sessions , but on the final day when the New York people made offers , their agent slept in . " When she finally did show up , all she did was show photos of girls who could n't make the trip . " It was disappointing . And expensive . Parents need to be aware of on-the-job exploitation as well . Vancouver actress Lynn Johnson recalls a commercial for a major department store where she was contracted to play the mom and her 18-month-old son , Connor , was hired as " back-up baby . " The experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , " says Johnson , " there were no provisions for the children  --  no quiet place , no crayons , nothing . " But what horrified her was the lack of safety standards . " The set was a platform ten or 12 feet off the ground . The other actor and I had to keep jumping up to make sure the baby was n't going to crawl over the edge . I was appalled . " Where was the baby 's mother ? " They did n't want her around , " Johnson says . " And she said OK to that . " To top it all off , the production staff constantly fed the baby gummy bears during shooting . " To each his own , " Johnson admits , " but it seemed they were going to get the shot no matter what it took . " The producer will try to get the shot  --  you can count on it . That 's his job . And if you are doing your job as parent , you will draw the line when your child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk as being . And do n't rely on labour legislation or union working agreements to do it for you . Laws regarding working children vary from province to province and do little to take into account the special needs of children in the entertainment industry . Performers ' organizations are lobbying for legislation in Canada similar to statutes in place in California ( which are specific to children in the entertainment industry and cover schooling , health and safety , hours of work and parental responsibilities ) . And industry representatives are negotiating stronger regulations in current production agreements . But the fact is that neither provincial labour ministries nor performers ' organizations have the ability to monitor every set . That 's where parents come in . If you know the business , you 'll know that an 11-year-old ca n't work for more than eight hours , for example . You wo n't agree to things just because the product is a trusted children 's brand or the producer makes great kids ' movies . And you 'll know when to be flexible and when to stand firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers with eyes glued to the balance sheet who exploit children . Teresa Tova is alarmed by some parents ' attitudes . " I see parents feed their kids coffee at two in the morning to keep them awake , because , " You know , the producer might want them in that other little shot . ' There 's no reality check . " And what about the money ? Given that you feel comfortable with children working at all , what kind of pressure lies on a child who is bringing in $15,000 never mind $500,000 a year ? And how will you manage the money ? Many industry professionals would like to see Canada adopt some version of California 's Coogan Act , which requires that a certain percentage of a child 's income be held in trust until she comes of age . But so far , there 's nothing similar in this country . The bottom line Like everything , having a child in the entertainment business is all about finding the balance . There are places to go , people to meet , fun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a wonderful opportunity for creative expression and personal development . But parents need to see through the glitz to the balance sheet . My wish , " says Tova , " is that parents do n't forget to be parents when it comes to children in the business . Do we really want a whole bunch of Macaulay Culkins and Michael Jacksons running around the world  --  children who have completely lost their childhoods ? If acting got in the way of my kids ' lives , " she says , " if they could n't play baseball and dance and have sleepovers , we would n't be doing it . The only reason we 're doing it is because it 's fun for them and they enjoy it . And , " she adds , " let 's be clear . It will pay for their education . " Now , go ahead , make that call . INITIAL INVESTMENTS Any business requires some investment . How much should you invest if the business happens to be your child ? No money up front , " advises Teresa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ACTRA Toronto Performers Branch . " Not for classes , not for photography , not for registration or finder 's fees . " If you 're asked for money ? " Walk away . All they are doing is lining their own pockets . " And be wary of agents who insist on a specific photographer . Reputable agents often give clients a list of recommended photographers , but it 's up to you to choose who you want . Fees vary , but usually run around $100 to $200 for a session ; copies are extra . Go to a photographer who specializes in thiskind of work , not a regular portrait photographer . Although eventually your child will need professional photos , for initial contact with an agent , a good snapshot should be fine . Delta , B.C. flight attendant Gail Francis and her son Andrew , ten , walked into their first agent interview four years ago with " no photo , no resume , no nuttin ' ' , honey , " she recalls with a laugh , " and went right to an audition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be very cautious , too , about spending money on classes . " If you think your child will benefit from modelling classes because it gives her poise and confidence , that 's one thing , " says casting director Stuart Aikins . " But commercial acting or modelling classes will not train your child to be an actor . " Nor are classes a guarantee of work . Some modelling " agencies " make their money from schools . They will be happy to take your money even though your child is not photogenic and has no aptitude for modelling . Although too much or the wrong kind of training can kill spontaneity in a child , most insiders agree that children who want to act in film , television , or theatre , eventually need training . " If kids are really interested they should go to classes where there are improvisational elements , " says Aikins , " where they expand their imaginations , where they are taught communication skills , singing , dancing . " Ask around about the school you are considering . What do students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is the school certified by anyone ? What does the Better Business Bureau say ? And if you 're just starting out , a class that introduces you to the business may be worthwhile . Some very reputable agents are connected to schools , but be wary of agents who insist you take their classes exclusively . " If they 're in the business of classes or photography , " Tova points out , " they 're not in the business of getting your kid work . " One final tip : never pay a registration fee . Extras agencies will often charge a small registration fee to separate the curious from the committed , but usually around $25 . Nathalie Gaulthier , who chairs the children 's committee of the newly formed Talent Agents and Managers Association of Canada ( TAMAC ) , knows of one Toronto agency that charges a $1,300 annual registration fee , a practice expressly forbidden in TAMAC 's guidelines . Agents make their money from commissions . The agent is paid after the job is done , and the industry standard is the same for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatre and print modelling . A STAR IS BORN ? Does your child have what it takes to be in front of the camera ? The basic and most important rule is this has to be your child 's idea , not yours . In every part of the business , whether it 's print modelling or feature films , the people who hire the kids look for enthusiasm and desire , and they can tell if your child does n't want to be there . Agent Nathalie Gaulthier watches how children and parents seat themselves when they come into her office for the first interview . " I look at body language , " she says . " If a parent sits right in front of me and the kid sits back against the wall , I know then and there it 's not going to work . " Vancouver Youth Theatre founder Carole Tarlington , now a children 's agent , has worked with child performers for 20 years . " The kids who are really successful want to do it more than anything , " she observes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones who ca n't imagine doing anything else . " Some may argue that small children are too young to know what they want , but Gaulthier disagrees . " When I was five years old , I said " I want to do that . " And I did . " She went on to work for ten years as a child performer in Montreal . If you 're not positive about your child 's interest and desire , test it out . " Enroll her in an extras agency , " casting director Stuart Aikins advises . " Let her do that for a while and see if she 's got the stamina . " Or try some classes . " Maybe what the child is looking for is some way of expressing herself other than going to school , " he says , suggesting dance or gymnastics classes might be all your little one really wants . Successful kids are those who are outgoing , bright and comfortable with adults . They must be able to listen and take direction . And rejection . While some kids may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months before they get the lucky phone call . Most work goes to children aged five to 14 . Kids who look younger than they are have a definite advantage . Although classic good looks are n't necessarily important , good teeth are . Special abilities in sports , music and dance are also a plus . Another , and perhaps , most important requirement is a good attitude . The child who makes it in showbiz will also have a family that is supportive and understanding , and parents who regard this as a business , not a social opportunity . And while looking out for your child 's interests is mandatory , pushy and aggressive stage moms or dads are definitely a liability . RULES AND REGULATIONS Many parents are intimidated by the entertainment business and do n't speak out on their kids ' behalf . While aggressive stage parenting will put a quick end to your child 's career , your child 's health and safety requirements are your responsibility . Here are a few of the basic rules that make sense in any venue . 1 When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " complete terms and conditions " of employment , including location , hours , hazards and special abilities required . The producer must also provide you with a script , including revisions , prior to and during shooting . 2 You must familiarize yourself with what 's required of your child . If you do n't understand , ask . If your child has a medical or psychological condition that limits his ability to perform , you must tell the producer . 3 If your child is under six years old , you must accompany her to the set and stay with her . No matter what your child 's age , one parent has the right to be within sight and sound of the child on set at all times , subject to production requirements . 4 Your child can not be required to work in a situation where there is clear and present danger . If you believe your child is in danger you have a right to make that known . 5 Auditions , tests and fittings can not be held during school hours ; after-school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be required to work after 11 p.m. without written parental consent .
