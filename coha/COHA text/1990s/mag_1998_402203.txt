// The man who 's internationally known as Puff Daddy has always been Sean Combs to me . His parents , Janice and Melvin ( who was murdered when Sean was 3 ) , and I were youngsters together in Harlem . I 've known Sean since the day he was born , and to him I 'm " Auntie Susan . " So naturally , ESSENCE 'S entertainment editor thought I 'd be the perfect person to get at what has n't already been reported or speculated about Sean . At first I did n't agree . But as I reviewed the many articles on my " godson , " I knew that there were many more layers to this very sensitive and complex young man than had been revealed-his vulnerabilities , his insecurities , his vision and his growing understand ing of his own personal power . Sure , over the last five years he 's dominated the music industry , garnering dozens of awards , tailoring artists into platinum acts and traveling in the upper echelons of entertainment . And sure , at age 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with film , fashion and publishing ventures in the works . But along the way , Sean has begun to realize that his success has come at a hefty price . Here he shares how the burdens of his celebrity-suspicion , gossip and even death-have edged him into a lonely space , and how he 's using that space to reevaluate what 's important to his life . I feel like this is a special time in my life because I 'm finally growing up ; I mean at a deeper level , where I 'm looking at myself and deciding what I really want out of life . I 'm trying to be more in control of what I do and say and build , so I can drive my life in the right direction . And that 's learned from really seeing myself and not being afraid to look at the mistakes I 've made in the past , or my successes either . And being able to decide at the end of the day what it all means-what has value and what is just materialistic . What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the smaller things in life , instead of like it 's been . Everything came in such a fast way for me-the tragedies and the successes . Like I was forced to grow up and act mature before I was ready . It 's like my whole life has been on display as this wonder kid or as a person always in some sort of controversy Now I just want to be me . Of course I still want to be Puff Daddy " cause that 's a part of me . But I want to make sure Sean Combs gets a chance to live . I would hate it if in the end I were just Puff Daddy ; that 's not who my parents brought into the world . I never would disrespect my father 's memory " cause it 's real unfortunate he 's not here , but my mother , she really held her own . She toughened me . I did n't miss a beat not having a father because my mother filled his shoes . Photograph // She was constantly pushing me . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had a gay uncle , a straight uncle , all her incredible women friends around me . She got me involved with sports . I lived in the suburbs and played with White kids . I went to Catholic school , but went to an after-school program in Harlem . Then I went to Howard University . I feel like I was nurtured into wanting to be somebody special . Like a lot of kids who grow up in single-parent homes , I had to get a job much quicker and start thinking about the future much earlier . I had to help out and become the man of the house sooner , so I had my paper route when I was 12 . I used to always get cracked on by the other kids about working at Playland and having two and three jobs . But I would always say to myself that I wanted to be somebody who makes history , and not selfishly , not for me . I just wanted to make a change . I did n't want to be a person who just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew I did n't want to just get a degree , like I was reaching to be the greatest stockbroker or the greatest lawyer . I was always creative and reaching beyond , out of the box . I had made up my mind that I was going to be successful , a multimillionaire . Now I 'm learning that I have the ability to be so strong in both negative and positive ways , but I want to give off only positive vibes and to motivate our youth . I 've tried to motivate young people in the music industry to be responsible Black executives , take control and get their own production companies and record labels . I 'm not saying that I 'm perfect . There are still days when I 'm a big asshole , when I 'll say or do something and it 'll be insensitive and very immature . It 's one of the worst things in my personality , and that 's the part of me I 'm trying to change . I go home and pray and ask God to help me when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm really moody , but I 'm trying to be more in control of my actions . Part of that means not being afraid to look at the mistakes I 've made in the past . That right there is frightening because I have to go deep inside , fight with myself , fight the fear of seeing the truth about myself . Keep Your Head Up I feel like I 'm fighting for so many things . Black men are born into the world fighting . We 're fighting for our dignity and for control of our lives . It 's like Black men 's lives are defined by pain . Everybody has pain , but if you 're a Black man , you 're gon na get your ass whipped from the get-go . Young Black men have been smothered with so much negative energy growing up always seeing ourselves on TV being arrested , hearing all the statistics about how we ca n't make it . So many of us have given up , feeling like " niggers will be niggers . " I want to help change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest people in the world-the way we look , the way we move , our creativity , the emotion and sensitivity we have . It 's definitely harder for me doing my work than it would be for a White man . But difficulties make me stronger . I feel like the Black man is untouchable . We just ca n't be stopped . We wo n't die . You can kill one of us , two of us , kill four of our spirits , but at the end of the day we 're still here . We just keep getting up . A Leader of Black Men I want to be accountable for myself , take some responsibility for my generation and become a leader of Black men . I 'm coming to understand my power , and I 'm not afraid of being a role model . I have these hit records . I have this money . I have this knowledge . But what am I going to do with them ? I want to become more of a leader outside of music , and definitely see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going on , how our people are being treated and the kind of world my kids are going to live in . I feel like I could use my economic power and the power I have in hip-hop and with young people to help determine who becomes the next president . That 's one of my missions : to mobilize the hip-hop community to endorse a presidential candidate . And one of the nominees is going to be smart enough to sit down and talk to the leaders of the hip-hop nation , because if we say we 're going to roll with that candidate , we potentially represent millions of votes . Photograph // We can put mayors , governors and a president in office . But before we endorse anyone , we want some guarantees that urban schools are going to be improved . We have to start getting what other nationalities get for their vote . Our kids are going to be locked out of the tweny-first century if they do n't know computers . So many ca n't even read , let alone use computers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uninformed . My music does n't have a political approach , but selling it results in economic power , and economic power is the basis of political power . The Soul oF Street Serenades It 's true that I 've written music that 's about violence and that some people thought I glorified it . But I was just dealing with reality . When Biggie was freestyling on " Gim me the Loot , " he wrote about the mind of somebody robbing and stealing for survival . There was this line where he said , " Give me the baby rings and the number-one-mom pendant . " It was so severe for this guy that he robbed this pregnant woman . I made Biggie change the lyric . But it 's like a double-edged sword . It was important to change the lyric and mute it out for radio , but I also felt it was important for everyone to know that when people in our communities are starving , we turn into savages just trying to survive . It was a prime example of what happens when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biggie and Tupac are dead , and that has nothing to do with any East-West thing . It has to do with ignorant people . And it 's not just in hip-hop either . Gianni Versace got his brains blown out and my man Phil Hartman 's wife blew his out . In hip-hop there 's always this push and pull between what 's real in the world and what people should hear . But in the last couple of years I think hip-hop artists have been checking themselves . I 'm not saying that hip-hop is all the way clean , but I will say that I 'm proud of the artists in the hip-hop community for not putting out music talking about bitches and ho 's like they used to . We are the modernday Marvin Gayes , and hip-hop is the music of the people . It 's the voice of our generation , and there is a lot of pain in our community . Pain and Promise I have my own personal pain , too . I ca n't really say I have any real deep friendships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of friends . A lot of that is due to me because I have n't been very trusting . But more than anything , it was the City College tragedy that broke me nine young people died at the New York City school in 1991 when fans rushed the doors at a celebrity basketball event that Sean had helped promote . Nobody can know what I went through . Everybody was saying , " Did he oversell the tickets ? Did he kill those kids ? " The world turned against me . Everybody I thought was my friend and loved me backed away , except my family and Misa , the mother of my first child , Justin . And she lost her best friend in the tragedy . I had never really experienced anybody dying , and then to be right there in the center of it . After the frenzy I looked up and everybody was gone . I was always taught never to run if you did n't do anything wrong , so I stayed in the gymnasium . I knew I would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there with nine bodies on the ground . Nobody else was there . No police , nobody . Just me and nine bodies . It was too much for me to handle . After the incident , it was like I was crazy , losing my mind ... thinking about the people who died , thinking about the families , thinking about their pain . For a while I was probably clinically insane . And then the personal losses hit me . It seemed like every two years-as soon as things would start getting good-something terrible would happen . My grandmother died , and just when I was getting over that loss , me and Misa broke up . Then , again , when I began to feel better , Biggie was murdered . We had gone through the whole East-West controversy for years , and we felt like people were trying to CONTINUED ON PAGE 198 Photograph Son Justin , 4 , happily encircled in a loving hug from Daddy .
