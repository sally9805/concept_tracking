Ken Host eases his bell 206 L3 helicopter up along the western side of Sunset Lookout , in the Boise National Forest . Once clear of the 7,500-foot peak , he is treated to a vast and stunning sight : hundreds of square miles of southern Idaho engulfed by fire . A palette of color  --  pink , gray , brown , black , magenta  --  spreads across the canyons and ridges ; parts of the mountainside are charred and smoldering . Thousands of feet below , stands of Douglas fir are ablaze . A great blond blanket of smoke obscures the eastern horizon . Though 24 firefighters have died this summer in the western inferno , the sight of the Rabbit Creek blaze below is , to the hovering pilot , somehow less terrifying than eerily beautiful . " Is this the best job in the world ? " asks Host , 48 , a U.S. Department of Energy pilot from Fort Collins , Colo. , whose job includes tracking the fire , dropping flame-retardant slurry on it and evacuating emergency victims . " Yep . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unlike thousands of other men and women who have come from all over the country to battle the western blazes this summer . With more than a month yet to go in this year 's fire season , they may be exhausted and unable to purge the smell of smoke from their clothes and hair , but their desperation to leave the line of fire alternates with an exhilaration in their work . " My wife says I 'm one of the last of the dragon slayers , " says Host 's commander Wayne Eddy , 51 , proudly . And this fire , he adds , is one tenacious beast . " We keep flanking it , trying to pinch it off at the head , " he says . " You never take a fire this big head-on . That 's death  --  that 's toast . But the longer you let it go , the more it changes direction on you . Fire is nothing if not unpredictable . " This summer the only sure thing that can be said about the fires raging through the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any in recent memory , a result of decades of fire-suppression policy combined with windy weather and eight years of drought . To date over 58,000 fires have destroyed some 3 million acres in the West  --  a territory four times the size of Rhode Island . Last week 17 major wildfires were raging in Utah , Oregon , Idaho , Montana and California . " This is probably , in terms of breadth and length , the most demanding fire season in the 29-year history of the National Interagency Fire Center , " says Rodger Vorce , co-commander of the Boise , Idaho , agency that , like Mission Control for NASA , is the nerve center of the entire fire-fighting operation . Since June 6 , Vorce , his co-commander Woody Williams and their colleagues have kept the NIFC running full throttle 24 hours a day , seven days a week , rounding up and dispatching crews and supplies across the West . But even this weary professional understands the enemy . " It 's just fire , " he points out . " It 's part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blaze is the most active of the fires that have blackened more than 288,000 acres across the state . Sparked by lightning in the mountains 30 miles northeast of Boise on on July 28 , it has already destroyed more than 100,000 acres in America 's national forests . Though rain last week has helped the cause , this blaze , which now covers some 240 square miles and may cost roughly $150 million in lost timber , will probably not be completely extinguished until the first snows arrive in mid-October . Until then , the 2,000 men and women who have been fighting Rabbit Creek  --  from planes , from helicopters and on the ground  --  are not ready to give up . " It does get in your blood , " says Wayne Eddy , echoing comments made by most of his fellow fighters of the flame . " You become enthusiastic about coming out here and slaying that dragon . " Not all the firefighters are hard-core parks and wildlife employees . This is the second summer that Laura Farnsworth , 28 , a Manhattan paralegal , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire-resistant pants and a yellow , flame-retardant shirt . And she has gone straight to the front lines . One of two women in the Pleasant Valley , Ariz. , Hotshots  --  an aggressive , 20-member fire-fighting unit that does the initial attack on the fire  --  Farnsworth was just looking for a little excitement when she heard about the job from a friend , sent in an application and passed a physical endurance test that included running , push-ups and sit-ups . " All the people at the firm where I work , " she says , " are jealous that I 'm out fighting fires . " And of the excitement she found . " I 've been in some ticklish situations , " she says . " But the scariest thing is n't the fire . Every once in a while , when it heats up , boulders will explode and come rolling down the mountain at you . It 's a big rush . " On Sat. , Aug. 27 , Farnsworth gets out of her sleeping bag at the Idaho City base camp , 18 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of a ridge at Willow Creek , at the northwestern edge of the fire . Until she crawls back into her tent after a 30-hour double shift , she will be mopping up after a " burnout "  --  when Hotshot crews deliberately set a fire in order to deprive an coming blaze of fuel . She and fellow Hotshot Tom Foster , 35 , have been assigned to keep an eye on charred trees that are still on fire . Like every other firefighter this summer , Farnsworth and Foster can not but think of the tragedy on Storm King Mountain in Colorado , where 14 people , including nine members of the Prineville , Ore. , Hotshots died on July 6 , when the wind changed direction and created an instant inferno PEOPLE , July 25 . " It 's always in the back of your mind , " says Foster , a construction worker from Macon , Ga . " But in a bad situation you have to trust each other . I 'd trust Laura with my life . " In addition to the " shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a user gets under only in the most dire of emergencies ) she carries in a pouch lapped to her toolbelt , Farnsworth puts her faith in a lucky charm she wears  --  a silver necklace , black from two summers of soot . When she can , she steals a moment to write home to her parents on a pad she keeps tucked in her fireproof shirt . " I keep telling them that what I 'm doing is fun and outdoorsy and is n't dangerous , " she says , picking up her shovel to put out a small fire a few feet away . " Do you think they 'll buy it ? " It is n't excitement that draws Farlan Ghahate close to the fire ; it is his humility in the face of nature . As he watches the flames lapping at the ponderosa pines and Douglas firs above and below him , Ghahate , 29 , a Native American who is a member of the Zuni 47 firefighting crew from Zuni Pueblo in northwestern New Mexico , sprays anything he can find that is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountain . " As a boy I was taught that trees are like people , " he explains . " It 's sad to see a tree that has survived so many years suddenly leave this life . " Every morning at sunrise , Ghahate and the other 19 members of his unit say a prayer and toss a handful of cornmeal on the ground before beginning their 14-hour shift . " The prayer is for safety , " he explains , " and the cornmeal is to pay respect to the trees , in case you have to cut one down . " A landscaper in Gallup , N.Mex. , and on his ninth summer with the Zuni crew , Ghahate has seen his wife , Georgia , and his two children , Cherissia , 5 , and Farley , 3 , only a few days this summer , but he says his family understands how important the work is to him . Still , he admits , " this fire is probably the most dangerous I 've been on  --  the whole forest could go up any minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He takes a swig from his canteen and squints into the stinging smoke . " I was taught to respect the land , " he says , " but now I have an even greater respect for the fire . " As well he might . Two days later the fire is still raging along Willow Creek , and 20 Sawtooth , Idaho , Hotshots are urgently trying to cut a new fire-containment line up the slope . Tony Davis , 32 , in his third season with the Hotshots , has been logging 80-hour weeks all summer , spending July in the Capitan district of the Lincoln National Forest in New Mexico before being called in on the Rabbit Creek fires . As the Hotshots , some wielding chain saws , others with Pulaskis ( a hand tool with a pick on one end , an ax on the other ) , hack their way up the trail , Davis admits he 's exhausted . " It 's been a gnarly season , " he says . " We 're living on four to five hours of sleep a night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotshots get paid $8 an hour plus overtime , plus a 25-percent hazardous-duty bonus , so by the end of his three-month stint , Davis should pocket some $12,000 . But for Davis , who works at a Sun Valley ski resort during the winter , the thrill is not in the money . He thrives on the danger and adventure of the work  --  particularly when he sets a fire for a burnout or fells trees to keep the flames from spreading . " It 's one of life 's greater experiences , " he confesses . " It 's kind of a taboo . I think we all like a little action on the line . " Davis 's girlfriend Stephanie Nelson , 23 , is also a third-year Sawtooth Hotshot , one of two women in the crew , and she too is an adrenaline junkie . Nelson , who grew up in Parkdale , Ore. , and graduated from the University of Puget Sound , has lost 16 pounds this season . But , she says , " I get to experience things that other people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciates her toughness . " She 's the first girl I 've ever I met who could keep up with me , " he says . " And she 's good and upbeat . I 'd hate to be without her . " Above the buzz of the Hotshots ' chain saws and the roar of the flames are the sounds of their air support . As many as seven helicopters and four C-130 military cargo planes fly back and forth dumping fire-retardant slurry  --  a gooey mixture of fertilizer , water , a gelling agent and pink dye that leaves bright lines across the landscape to show which areas have already been hit . The C-130s  --  with names like " Mrs. Dowsefire " and " Forest Dump " painted on their fuselages  --  can unload 3,000 gallons of slurry at once , painting a stripe a quarter-mile long and 60 feet wide . But though the pilots do not come close to the flames , this is dangerous work . As soon as they drop their pay loads , the planes become drastically unbalanced ; hot air can suck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead gray trees blend in with the smoke , leading to terrifying near-misses . " Every pilot is thinking all the time , " How do I get out of this if I have to ? ' ' " says Lt. Col. Clyde Doheney , 47 , of the Air National Guard in Point Mugu , Calif . Doheney went to law school after he quit the Air Force in 1973 but joined the National Guard when he got bored of doing corporate law . On a busy day he may fly as many as 8 to 10 hours of continuous missions , going back and forth between the fire and the airport in Boise to get more slurry . But Doheney takes a modest view of his role in the war . " This is like the cavalry , " he says . " We come from far away , make our strike and leave . The guys who are really doing the work are out there in the dirt , sucking smoke all day long . " At the end of a day fighting the Rabbit Creek blaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and school buses , back to the base camp at Idaho City . The 10-acre camp , at a National Forest Service maintenance facility , has 800 tents , a bank of four pay phones , a commissary and a shower trailer . But the most popular spot is the mess tent , where kitchen crews are working 12-hour shifts . At a typical breakfast , says Mark Frandsen , 37 , who manages Blagg 's Food Services and has worked seven fire sites in two months , the troops will run through 2,160 eggs , 375 pounds of bacon and sausage , 3,000 slices of toast , 800 pounds of Idaho potatoes and 200 gallons of coffee . And though Frandsen has not seen his three children in 62 days , he says , " I 'm not alone . There 's lots of people who are missing their kids ' first day of school or a birthday . We 're all united in our cause : get the fire put out , so we can go home . " To many of the men and women fighting the Rabbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They find themselves repeating a version of the same mantra : " Only a few more weeks to go . " But as the forests go through their natural cycles of destruction and rebirth , many of these same firefighters will be back on the lines again next summer . " Some days you may have a tough day , and you whine , but you stick with it , " Tony Davis explains . " And in the winter you forget all the hateful stuff and remember the cool stuff , and it keeps sucking you back in . " <p>
