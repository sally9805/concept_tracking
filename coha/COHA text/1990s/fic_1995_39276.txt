It was 1973 , the summer of Watergate , but my mind was not on politics , but literature . While the parade of unreliable narrators told their stories on daytime television to be followed by their nightly commentators , I read , mostly Russians , mostly classics : Tolstoy , Dostoyevsky , Chekhov . I did n't really enjoy Chekhov , those lonely doctors , shabby and sentimental . I preferred the grandiose passions of their fathers , and thought I understood them . <p> There was a girl  --  there were still twenty-year-old " girls " then . How long ago was it , oh , about as many springs as she was young that summer . You can always count on a thief for a fancy prose style . And you , the one with the degree , you already think you know where I 'm going , you 've already over-leaped the transition from the blunt forms of Czarist fiction into the heady flamboyance of the twentieth century . <p> It was actually Andrei Biely who led me to Mr. Nabokov . Usually it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autodidact without benefit of tutelage , and relied upon one volume to pull me to another . I haunted the used bookstores of Fourth Avenue , inhaling the must from Dauber and Pine 's basement as if it were motes in the rose window at Chartres . Even then the grand street was a shade of its glorious past , but there were remnants of the glory . I found a dog-eared Grove Press edition of St. Petersburg . The title called to me and even more so the quote on the back , declaring this book one of the four great works of the century , along with The Metamorphosis , Remembrance of Things Past and Ulysses , so I bought it for a dollar , but what really thrilled me was not the unknown masterpiece , but its unknown advocate who dared to place it in the same pantheon as those other monuments  --  as if he defined such realms . The arbiter 's name was Nabokov . <p> I had heard of Lolita , but only after reading the author 's extravagant , arrogant blurb for the esoteric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best-seller out from the disorganized bins in front of the Pageant , several blocks and a half-dozen other venerable antiquarians away from Dauber and Pine , and fell in love  --  with the author as well as his heroine . Every word fell into place , each syllable echoed , and I sought out his other books . None were less thrilling . In Ada , he penned the best parenthesis in literary history , describing a character 's tragic demise " ( picnic , lightning ) . " After several wrong guesses , I made it a point to learn how to pronounce his name , moving from Nah-bah-kov , accent first on the first , then on the second , and third on the last syllable , to Nuh-boak-off , accent dead center . <p> I found a photograph taken of him sitting on a stone-balustraded terrace in the Alps , a delicate kirschwasser at hand , a butterfly net angled against his attan chair . He was wearing thick loden shorts with a button-down shirt . In this first image , I saw no shoes , but had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw him in my mind , and then in the flesh . <p> I was walking the streets of the city that summer , map in hand , determined to cover every block on the magic island before Labor Day . Do n't ask why . It was the literal-minded youth 's manner of making the city his own . Sometimes this led me to inspiration , more frequently to a mathematical figure . I learned the best pattern to cover the most blocks without overlapping footsteps , the snake , rive to river , east to west , down a block , river to river , west to east . Later I strode in 100-block straight lines down the avenues . I took in brownstones , warehouses , office towers , imagining the lives led there , as I avoided dragging my march-sore feet to soak in the bathtub in the kitchen of my girl 's apartment on West Fourth , near where it intersects West Eleventh , where the grid gets tangled and you ca n't pursue a simple snakewind . <p> That day , July 15 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nation , I was on Madison Avenue in the thirties when I was yanked from my plan to cover Turtle Bay by a familiar profile not twenty feet away . It was Mr. Nabokov himself ( despite our subsequent intimacy , I will never be able to refer to him as Vladimir , emphasis on the fit or second syllable , let alone the sweet diminutive Vlady ) . I recognized him as much by stature as profile . He was a heavy man  --  made substantial by vocabulary  --  and had thin hair swept back off a high , sweaty forehead . It was summer , and Nixon was sweating too . The novelist had smallish eyes and a prominent nose and presidential jowls that I could not see at first , since he was angled , keeping a watch on a checker cab  --  there were still checkers then  --  taking a too tight right turn in order to pick up a woman holding a small dog . Perhaps he was thinking of Chekhov , whom he admired . <p> Then he crossed the street . Maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few moments for me to realize that I was following . " Hey , " I said to myself , " this is a creepy thing to do . This is what G. Gordon Liddy did . " Then I relaxed and enjoyed my transgression . <p> I assumed that he was heading for the Morgan Library , to examine the antique etchings in the mansion that may have reminded him of his family home confiscated by the Revolution sixty years earlier . But he passed directly by the stately porte cochere . We continued northward against the pedestrian traffic flowing southward from Grand Central Station . I was astonished that people did not recognize him , pester him , adore him . I turned to make certain I was not the lead sheep for a flock of acolytes and nearly lost him . He wove with an elegant , even mincing , gait through the commuters ' rough oceanic flow . At Thirty-eighth Street , he paused to examine a hot-dog-and-pretzel salesman , inhaling the scent of the New World . But despite the apparent randomness of his path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps he was in New York for a meeting of a genealogical society or to confer with a lawyer suing the Soviet regime for restitution of stolen property , an estate roughly the size of Connecticut , or to make a presentation at a symposium on the sexuality of verbs . Or perhaps he was en route to a lunch date with his publisher , some bushy-haired thug who planned to berate him for not repeating the succes de scandale of Lolita . <p> The man clearly had a reason for being on this block in this unseasonable city . <p> There was a bookstore on the corner that specialized in travel writing , its window full of Baedekers and memoirs . Perhaps he required some esoteric volume on Micronesia for research into a new project , Pnin in Tahiti . By following I might anticipate his next novel . But he passed the store without so much as a glance . <p> He veered off the avenue at Thirty-ninth Street , where the buildings rose in height , and I hurried and nearly bumped into him . He was stationary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe store with a slim brown awning  --  perhaps to catch me off guard . I think he sensed my presence all along , but was too generous , or too removed to take offense , and the sinister bend in his path was meant to allow me to pass ahead gracefully and leave him be . Instead , I pretended great interest in a sign designating local parking regulations , as if the low-slung sports car at the curb belonged to me . I noticed that the meter had expired , so I fished into my trousers and found a dime and gave it another half hour , and leaned against the hood I felt I had rented for half a circle on the tiny municipal timepiece of sorts . <p> But the master 's absorption in the wares of the shoe store seemed genuine , and then he entered . I was close enough to feel a draft from within . Since then I 've learned that shoe stores always turn the air-conditioning way up , so that sweaty socks do not create unpleasant odors to offend other customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a tired manner appeared , to join him on the inside of the front window . Words were exchanged . <p> The fellow took a pair of wing tips from the window , but Mr. Nabokov shook his head and gestured several inches to the side , moving his finger in an arc that bisected the window and my stomach like a surgeon 's blade . I could have told the clerk which shoes such a man preferred , an oxblood cordovan , with cylindrical laces like spaghetti rather than the more common flat linguini style . They were comfortable , elegant , Italian . <p> Suddenly I was keenly aware of my own footgear , a pair of Converse All-Stars that had seen better days . How long ago , oh , you know that one . A lace had broken and I had made an awkward knot between grommets that kept it from tying snugly . There was a tear in the side and , worst , a worn spot in the sole . I was standing in a slight depression in the asphalt in which a pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wetting my socks . It was the third day I had worn those socks and they were stiff . The puddle was a cooling lubricant to my chafing toes . <p> Mr. Nabokov held the sample and flexed it to make certain it had the suppleness he required to cushion his great bulk . It was a left shoe , as were all the samples . I wondered if Mr. Nabokov knew that the right foot is usually larger than the left , the reason why stores always use left shoes for samples , to fool people into thinking their own feet are minimally more tasteful than they really are . Of course , he knew everything ; he would factor that into his decision and did not require my advice . Appreciating the texture , he nodded , and lowered himself ponderously into a row of chairs linked together like those in a movie theater as if he had hemorrhoids . <p> The clerk then knelt at his feet  --  I would have exchanged positions with him in a flash  --  and placed the novelist 's rather small hoof into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small silver tray with sliding extrusions , ridged to simulate toes , that came from the top to the black marking that read 7 1/2 , while another bar slid in from the side to determine width . The result was unusual ; his feet were wide , perhaps splayed from Alpine hikes in search of rare butterflies . By then I knew his hobbies , habits and obsessions . Now I knew his shoe size . <p> Then the clerk disappeared into the back room to fetch the requested shoes while Mr. Nabokov peered about the store , at the other styles of left shoes on display together with wooden stretchers and other accoutrements of the trade . The store also sold umbrellas , but it was n't raining ; it was humid . <p> The clerk returned , and knelt again to insert Mr. Nabokov 's foot into the merchandise . Thus shod , he paced back and forth in front of a mirror set upon the carpeted floor . He looked out the window at me , and I patted the car proprietarily while a man in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man looked at the meter , perplexed , and then at me . Distracted , I missed the next phase of the transaction , but when I looked back Mr. Nabokov was at the counter , reaching into his vest pocket to extract a wallet whose Florentine leather was as luscious as the shoe , and then came the moment I was not waiting for . Apparently spontaneously , he plucked a pair of shoelaces from the spindly , multiarmed rack on the counter beside an enormous brown cash register . I might have guessed he would purchase an extra pair of laces ; the man was fastidiously prepared for any contingency a traveler might face . I was caught with a hole in my sneakers , wading in a puddle , prepared only to make rubbery squishing noises for the rest of the afternoon . There was only one problem . The laces were yellow . <p> I was so shocked at this whimsy I forgot the fellow whose car I had usurped , and hardly heard as he cleared his throat and said , " Excuse me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ring and authoritative chunking open of the cash register . <p> " Please get off my car . " <p> Lemon yellow . <p> " I 'm going to call the police . " <p> Crayola yellow . <p> Fortunately , Mr. Nabokov left the store . He was cradling a rectangular box presumably containing his old shoes , since he was sporting his new ones , enjoying every step , dancing a one-man quadrille between sidewalk squares , composing a line in his furrowed forehead , something about a chessboard . <p> " Take your fucking car , " I sneered , and gratuitously kicked the fender of the steel perch I had been evicted from , as we moved further north , past the railroad terminal , toward the hotel . <p> It was n't the Algonquin , which I would have expected from my callow early readings , but an anonymous hostelry on the same block , also named for an Indian tribe  --  in those days there were still " Indians . " <p> Pretending that water was not cascading back and forth in the cavity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liveried doorman as if I belonged , or maybe my parents belonged , and I , the impoverished prodigal , was visiting them for a good meal and a handout designated to pay the rent but destined to be squandered in used bookstores . My first thought once past the sentry was that the state of the air-conditioning he guarded was far from the shoe store 's . The lobby was nearly as sultry as the street . It had a few sickly palms in pots . <p> Mr. Nabokov made a side trip to the thick mahogany receptionist 's desk to check for messages , but there were none in whichever empty pigeonhole the clerk cast his bored glance upon . If there had been , I was ready to note the room number , but there was n't . I was already plotting how I might call in from the lobby phone booth in order to see which slot he placed a faint blue " While you were out ... " slip into , but then Mr. Nabokov moved toward the elevator . <p> It was an old-fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working arrow without a tip , and it was protected by an art nouveau gate operated by an elderly man , who was either a midget or looked like one , sitting on a stool behind the large brass lever that controlled the elevator . He wore a rumpled brown uniform and matching cap clamped low over his brow . The fellow saw me and paused , to avoid a second trip , but I quickly feigned interest in the sundries stand , examining a Time magazine with John Dean on the cover . Nonetheless the operator 's wait was well-timed for purposes of saving his own labor because a well-dressed woman entered the elevator a second before his left arm , elongated by decades of single-limbed exercise , stretched to pull the gate closed . Then I rushed for the stairs that spiraled around the vehicle as it rose . At each floor , I glanced at the position indicator atop each closed entry door . At each floor , the arrow was still ascending . I was out of breath , but determined . I was dizzy , circling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could hear its chains clanking . It stopped on six , and I halted several feet below , directly behind the cab , gasping for breath , looking down at all the flights I had climbed and the wet sneaker prints evaporating in my wake . The woman got off . <p> Once stopped , it was hard to recapture my breath , but I followed again as the elevator recommenced , and the woman stared at me as I brushed past her in my eagerness to match the elevator 's pace . We passed seven and eight and then , thank God , it stopped again on nine and Mr. Nabokov alit . I peered from behind , while the operator continued upwards alone in response to an urgently blinking light that summoned him to twelve , the penthouse . <p> Mr. Nabokov , who did not lodge in the penthouse , walked down the hall , its carpet thinner than the shoe store 's plush , and stopped in front of the third door on the right . If I was correct in my estimation of direction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one to the rear , from the hotel into an air shaft between it and another ninth floor in a building fronting on the next block . He shifted the box with his old shoes from one arm to the other and removed the key from his trousers pocket . I heard it click , and saw the door swing open , revealing a glimpse of an unmade bed and a plaid suitcase . Then it closed . <p> I was steeling myself to knock , to introduce myself , and perhaps kneel . I walked to the door , and stopped . Brass numbers were glued onto the ersatz wood-grain surface glued to the steel that the hotel 's original portals had been replaced with in order to comply with city fire regulations , one askew . A yellow shoelace was strung around the knob . <p> There was a bar off the lobby of the hotel , but it was mote of an extension of the lobby than a room of its own . It was a dark alcove , suitable for assignations and mediocre salesmen . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could think of , and I tried to look as if the bartender did not need to request identification from me , as if I was used to drinking by myself in midtown hotel bars on Tuesdays in July . The television in the corner showed Senator Ervin , full of righteous indignation . <p> Did Mr. Nabokov purchase the shoe merely to justify purchasing the laces ? That yellow strand was obviously a symbol , but of what , and to whom ? Or was it some aristocratic Russian custom , gone with the monarchy in all but his own personal etiquette ? I ransacked my recollection of his books in search of a clue . <p> Of one thing I was certain , it was not an affectation . Neither was he here for a publisher , nor did he say to the members of the genealogical association , " I 'll be in the Hotel Mohawk , on Forty-fourth Street , in the room on the ninth floor with a yellow shoelace draped over the knob . " Was this a message left for a salacious schoolgirl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to return to the ninth floor and confront the mystery . I thought He would do no less . This time I took the elevator , despite the smirk of the operator . <p> As soon as he let me off onto the stained carpet lit by dim fixtures , I knew that something had changed between the thickly impastoed walls during my sojourn in the bar . In front of Room 918 , there was a pair of shoes . The great man had left them for shining , but they were his brand-new cordovans , which did not require shining . They fairly glowed with their own pale fire . Nonetheless , my first inclination was to expedite the great man 's request , to take them down to the bar and caress them with the cocktail napkins embossed with a cartoon of a martini glass and an olive on a pike . Then I thought of peeing in the shoes . <p> It was a moment of high giddiness , the liquor speaking , I told myself . But what would he think ? Perhaps that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the texture of the ruined leather now resembled the flakiness of a butterfly 's wings . <p> Or would he fail to think in images , and merely fume with outrage at the vulgarity  --  or delight in the vulgarity  --  of American culture ? Or would he remember a day back at the homestead when , four years old say , and already quadralingual , he peed in his family 's butler 's boots , and chuckle at the reminiscence of how the man had to wear them anyway , squishing around for afternoon tea as if he was a child in water-sodden sneakers much to the young Vlady 's ( I mean Mr. Nabokov 's ) barely restrained hilarity . <p> Then I noticed the really remarkable thing ; the shoes were there , but the yellow lace was not . <p> It was back to the bar , shattered by the strangeness . I scribbled frantically on the napkins I would have used to shine the shoes if I had made that decision . I made diagrams and charts of the series of events . First shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lace on the door . Then the lace off the door and the shoes in front of the door . I made arrows back and forth , like the arrows atop the elevator . Perhaps he was a spy  --  there was still a U.S.S.R. then  --  and this was an elaborate code meant to convey information . <p> I tried to recall if the lace had been looped around the knob in a particular knot , the shape of a double helix connoting biological research or coiled in representation of a hydroelectric plant or tied into crisscrossed ovals for uranium . I flailed myself for my lack of perception and analytical capacity . I considered returning upstairs , but was terrified that I might find no shoes , and laces again , and began to question my own sanity . <p> " Another ? " the bartender said . <p> I thought I had had enough . <p> " This one 's on the house , " he said . <p> I did n't know that this was standard procedure . It 's called a buyback , and occurs after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had n't intended to tip well , but had miscalculated in my confusion . Ignorant of my generosity , I thought he recognized me , admired me . So I accepted his gift , as graciously as a Nobel Prize . I started to make an acceptance speech , but he was called to the other end of the bar by the woman whom I had last seen on the sixth-floor landing . She must have changed out of her uncomfortable heels and taken the elevator down while I was pondering the situation on nine . I think she winked at me . I gulped the drink and fled , leaving no tip . <p> Much as I wanted to exit onto the street and return to my grid , I was compelled upstairs one last time . I know my behavior was suspicious , but I was beyond caring . I think the elevator operator would have called the house detective if he gave a damn . I could n't tell if it was me or him who smelled of Scotch . The cage came to a shuddering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man said . <p> I did . The difference in levels was so miniscule I could barely discern it , and I wondered if he was sarcastic . I might have ripped that dumb monkey 's cap from his head , or thrown him down the shaft . <p> The cage lingered while I inspected the safety certificate framed besides a standpipe with a hose like an endlessly elongated shoelace for a giant 's seven-league boot . It was expired . I was about to turn to check on the elevator certificate too , me , Mr. Probity , when the vehicle was summoned , probably by the woman downstairs , disappointed in the bar 's booze or the company . <p> As warily as if I had been invited to a beheading , I tiptoed down the hall , studiously keeping my eye on the doors on the odd-numbered side until I was about even with his door to my blind side . <p> I did n't know what to expect when I turned : a lace without shoes , a pair of shoes without laces , an open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dogging him , a jar of live butterflies , Vera , or an autographed copy of Lolita inscribed , " To Kevin , With Lust . " In any case , I knew , knew in my belly , that I would not be faced with a blank door . <p> It was the least dramatic of these alternatives , the shoes , alone , again , as if the lace had been my mistake , a mirage . For a second I wondered if I was not mad , but simply wrong , if the man I had followed was not Mr. Nabokov at all , but just a salesman , in town for a convention and a little shopping and maybe some hanky-panky , and if the shoes were not new , but overdue for a shining . It was a service of the hotel that anyone would use , like the shampoo in the complimentary miniature tubes . But the shoes were new and they were beautiful . <p> Before I knew what I was doing , I had slipped off my sneakers and tried on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny bit smaller than my right . I did n't pace the corridor to make certain of the fit . I did n't ask the clerk or the genius for another size . I slipped on the right . And then , dear reader , I fled . I honestly ca n't say whether it was because I did n't have a box to place them in , or in shabby recompense , but I left my wet sneakers in front of the door without the shoelace . <p> I did n't dare face the elevator operator and took the stairs three at a time , slipping on my new shoes ' barely scuffed soles , but on six , as I rounded the corner toward five , I could have sworn that I saw another shoelace , lime green , Crayola green , hanging from a knob several doors down the corridor . <p> The palmed lobby was different in my new shoes . And the city was different in my new shoes . I tossed my idiotic map of the grid into a garbage can on the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet ached a little , for the fit was imperfect . My feet were larger and narrower than His . <p> The real problem came later when I arrived in the West Village . I walked up four steep and creaking flights to my girlfriend 's apartment without leaving a single wet footprint , and I was n't happy when I turned my key in the lock . Vanessa did n't read and she did n't steal , not even shoplift . <p> Nixon resigned later that summer . <p>
