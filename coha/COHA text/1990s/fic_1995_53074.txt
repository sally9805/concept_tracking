I 'd never expected to return to Britain , but there I was , standing in the Immigration line at Heathrow airport . Apparently it used to be one of the busiest airports in the world . When I had flown out twenty years ago , it was already well into its decline . Now most of the buildings and all but one ranway were closed down . Half the fluorescent lights had been switched off to conserve power , and the temperature in the terminal was barely above freezing . <p> I squeezed my daughter 's cold hand , glanced down to check that her coat was still buttoned up . She had taken her toy rabbit out of the baggage trolley , and was busy chewing its long ragged gray ears . <p> " Clarissa  --  " I tried to get her to let go of the rabbit , but she braced herself , her thin face scrunched up with determination . <p> " Eat rabbit , " Clarissa told me . <p> The old man ahead of me in the line turned round , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue tattoo on the center of her forehead . He nudged the woman beside him . " Look , there 's one of those morons behind us . I thought they were all meant to be upgraded by now ' . " <p> I pulled Clarissa closer to me , but she did n't seem to have heard . Or maybe she did n't understand . Her vocabulary had peaked around her seventh birthday . Now , less than a year later , the hard-gained knowledge was coming unraveled , more words slipping from Clarissa 's grasp every day . <p> Slowly the line shuffled forward , all of us smelling of stale sweat and desperation . The handful of tourists and reporters had long since vanished past the Temporary Visit booth . Anyone crazy enough to be immigrating to Britain had to be desperate in one way or another . <p> The old couple ahead of me were refused entry . I could n't hear the reason , but I heard the old man swearing his face darkening to a choleric red . His wife tugged at his sleeve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the dim expanse of the terminal . <p> " Next , " called the immigration official . <p> Swallowing hard , I walked forward . In the chaos of leaving New York , sifting through twenty years of accumulated junk to pack a single suitcase , I 'd never considered that I might be denied entry to Britain . <p> I handed the man my documents , and he paged through them with bored efficiency . " Says here you used to be a British citizen . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " But you took the technical proficiency test , and qualified for entry to the U.S. " <p> " Yes . " The words had run out of my head just like Clarissa 's . Her fingers were entwined in mine in a sticky knot . I stared at the man dumbly . Despite his navy blue uniform and crew cut hair , he managed to look scruffy . At night , he probably went home , put his feet up on the sofa , and watched telly all evening . But here he was judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " See , we do n't ordinarily readmit people who upped and left soon as things got tough . You re-scin-ded your citizenship when you went . " He spun out each syllable of rescinded as though it were a parliamentary edict . " You got any ex-tenu-ating circumstances ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> He looked at me expectantly . <p> " My daughter  --  " the rest of the speech died in my throat . I lifted Clarissa up so that he could see her tattoo . <p> He leaned forward , and reached out to touch Clarissa . I put her down quickly , but his face was unexpectedly sympathetic . " My sister had a boy like that . Her husband wanted her to sell him , you know , to America or Japan for upgrading . So my sister divorced him , and she 's looking after the kid by herself . " <p> He stamped my papers . " You can go . I 've given you unlimited entry on compassionate grounds . Your daughter looks like a nice kid . Good luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to cry . He did n't know me , but he was trying to be kind . I 'd almost forgotten what that felt like . As Clarissa and I were walking away , he called after us , " If you 've time , take her to the Zoo . They 've got a baby giant panda . " <p> London had n't changed . Oh , the youngsters were sporting primary-colored bands of body fur instead of the spiky hairstyles I remembered , and there were few private cars left on the road . But in comparison to Los Angeles or Tokyo , it was like stepping into the past . A few decades ago , back when parliament almost revoked the fight to silence , pundits predicted that Britain would soon be a Big Brother state , complete with twenty-four hour surveillance and electronic ID cards . <p> But in 2009 , the Ecorights party passed stringent laws forbidding any form of electronic recording or tracking of people 's movements . Two years later , they finally gave Britain a constitution , protecting human rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aliens ) , animal rights , and plant rights  --  all the way down to the endangered country hedgerows . And despite the failing economy and the seesaw of political power , the constitution had survived intact . <p> As Clarissa tagged along with me on my job-hunt , she kept stopping and looking around as though she 'd lost something . <p> Finally she tugged on my hand as we waited at Piccadilly Circus tube station . " Mummy , where did the eye-spies go ? " <p> " Spy-eyes " I corrected automatically . Then I hoisted her up on my hip . " There are n't any spy-eyes over here . No spy-eyes , no hovercars , and no tattoos . " <p> I brushed her forehead gently . The day we 'd flown in , I 'd taken Clarissa to Great Ormond Street Children 's Hospital . The plasterwork was flaking from the walls , and the medical facilities barely rose to X-ray machines , but the doctor pretended to talk to Clarissa 's rabbit while he examined her . And three hours later , Clarissa had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't even charged me . <p> Clarissa had been remarkably patient during the job-hunt , but I 'd noticed the ears on her rabbit getting more and more ragged . Whenever I had to leave her , she took the rabbit out and chewed on it . Sometimes a receptionist would try to play with her , but Clarissa just chewed the rabbit in big-eyed silence until I returned . <p> I finally found a job predicting rates of chemical contamination in the water supply . On the morning before I was due to start , I took Clarissa to London Zoo . After all the U.S. media reports of starvation caused by Britain 's outdated anti-technology stance , I was bemused that they were still keeping the Zoo open . I had n't seen any evidence of starvation in London itself , but I presumed the situation was worse in other parts of the country , and a single elephant eats enough to feed six families . <p> But the Zoo was not only open , it was the most crowded , most high-tech place I 'd seen since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the enclosures , watched holographic computer simulations explaining the animals ' diets and habitats and life cycles . A pool the size of two football stadiums extended into Regent 's Park , filled with eighty dolphins and a bewildering assortment of fish . <p> Clarissa clutched my hand as we walked through a tunnel extending through the middle of the pool , the blue-green water glowing all around us in the sunlight . She let go of her rabbit for a moment to stare at a baby dolphin sliding up and over the glass tunnel , its gray belly inches from her nose . Audio speakers relayed its high-pitched squeaks , and Clarissa whistled back at it . <p> She pointed at the water . " Want to go play . " <p> " I 'm sorry , that 's only for the dolphins . They 'd be frightened if you joined them . " <p> " I want to play . " <p> I took a deep breath . " Clarissa  --  " <p> But she 'd already switched her attention to a bright yellow ball that was rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spun i t around until the boy who owned it came along . Her fingers trembled as she let him take the ball . I pressed my hands against her fingers , trying to hold them still , but the shaking continued , like a small rapid echo of her heartbeat . <p> Clarissa looked up at me . " Mummy sad ? " <p> " No , no  --  I 'm happy . " I patted her shoulder . " Let 's go and see the bears . " <p> But I 'd read the scientific literature on DIMS ( degenerative impaired mentation syndrome ) , and I recognized the symptoms . First , higher level cognitive functions are affected , often causing aphasia and other linguistic problems . Next , secondary motor control functions deteriorate , producing both the onset of palsy and severe tissue damage to Broca 's area , the part of the brain that is the center of speech . In this phase , children begin to stutter and develop muscular twitches of increasing severity . <p> Somehow we 'd reached the bear enclosure and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . Clarissa crouched down , watching intently as the man tossed out food , the bears deftly snagging the carrots and other tidbits with their paws . <p> I pressed my forehead against the cool metal netting closed my eyes for a second . Maybe I should n't have brought Clarissa back to England , maybe Paul was right . The night Clarissa was diagnosed with DIMS he had held me for hours in bed , not asking questions , not trying to kiss me . <p> Eventually Paul had cleared his throat . " Emma , I 'll go with you to Electrosim in the morning . " <p> " What ? " I pulled away from him . " Paul  --  that 's not funny . " <p> His face twisted in a way I 'd never seen , harsher , patronizing . " Oh come on , you know we ca n't keep her . Why would you even want to ? Electrosira is nearby and they pay well . " <p> I stood up , started dressing . I 'd spent five years with Paul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He expected me to sell my daughter to Electrosim like a broken car . And then they 'd implant the cyber enhancements in her damaged cerebrum , and in a few weeks she 'd be sold again as the world 's most expensive luxury , a human robot . Add the correct software and she could pilot a hypersonic jet or carry out a preprogrammed sexual fantasy . <p> " Emma  --  do n't overreact . " He sat up in the bed , the fine blond hairs on his chest picked out by the bedside lamp . " I 've always been willing to spend time with your daughter , but this is something else again . It 's not fair to Clarissa to drag this out . You know I 'm right . " <p> " Mummy ? " <p> I snapped back to the present . Feeding time was over , and Clarissa 's face was screwed up . " I want to go wee-wee . " <p> I led her over to the toilets , waited outside her door , wondering how long it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIMS drool and may lose bladder control . It 's a messy , ugly disease that steals children piece by piece . I 've read the theories about what causes the cellular changes , the impact of various chemical pollutants on the formation of the central nervous system . But none of the theories evoke the reality of the disease as clearly as an interview with one of the first parents of a DIMS child . <p> He said it was like watching the tide flow out of his son . <p> And so it was . Every day , another piece of Clarissa ebbed away , and there were pebbles and broken shells left behind , fragments that would never come whole again . <p> At work , my boss was very tolerant . He allowed me to take Clarissa into the office , where she spent most of the day sitting underneath my desk  --  holding her rabbit and drawing pictures with fat wax crayons . <p> I took the pictures back to our rented apartment , pinned them on the walls . At first the pictures were recognizable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yellow dogs , and luminous pink fish . After a month , I had to ask her what the swirling loops of color meant . After another month , she could n't answer . <p> But she smiled . <p> Her smile widened as her vocabulary shrank . Except for the brief periods when I had to leave her , or the jab of a syringe on our weekly appointment at Great Ormond Street Hospital , she seemed to always be smiling . <p> One evening in April , after work , we celebrated her eighth birthday in our apartment . I 'm not sure Clarissa knew what the cake represented , but she beamed at me while I blew the candles out . Seconds later , she had chocolate cake over everything from her cheeks to the tablecloth . <p> I spooned a little of it into her mouth , checked her diapers , carried her over to the bay window . The rain was still pelting down , the sky nearly dark though it was only six o'clock . <p> Clarissa laid the side of her face against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the different sounds as it splashed against the glass window , the leaves , the puddles in the gutter . Provided I overlooked the persistent tremor of her skinny arms , she looked like a normal child . <p> I knelt down beside her , and hugged her tight , breathing in the clean sweet smell of her hair . <p> Two days later , Clarissa had a severe asthmatic attack . I held her in my lap , waiting for the ambulance to arrive , waiting for each wheeze of air from her lungs . The skin around her nose and mouth paled , then tinged to blue . <p> A siren wailed toward us , and I raced out to the road . The paramedic had to force my fingers loose from Clarissa 's arms . All the way to the hospital , I sat opposite her , watching the imprint of my fingers fade from her arms , the thin oxygen mask hiding her face . <p> The hospital waiting room was a blank horror . All I remember was the tea , thick white pottery cups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , briskly sympathetic above his starched labcoat . " We 'll need to keep Clarissa hospitalized from now on . Her autonomic nervous system is beginning to be affected . " <p> He led me to the ward , steered me to the chair by her bed . <p> Clarissa was sedated , an oxygen mask fastened over her nose and mouth . I did n't even know if I wanted her to wake up . I was n't sure she 'd recognize me . I was n't sure I 'd recognize my daughter in what was left of Clarissa . <p> I closed my eyes , Paul 's parting shot returning across the months . " What do you want to do ? Watch your daughter turn into a vegetable because upgrading is unnatural ? That 's selfish bullshit . " Paul lowered his voice , held out both hands palm up . " If she 's upgraded , then she can give something back to society . " <p> And in a way Paul was right ; I 'd known that all along . The American administration is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a net importer or exporter of human robots , whether they can be used to boost national productivity . <p> From the start they overlooked abuses in the system : mothers who took drugs to induce subnormal babies so they could sell them , children condemning their parents as legally senile so they too could be upgraded . Three weeks before I left America , Congress passed a bill making upgrading compulsory for all subnormals . <p> Yet despite that , despite the rich men who buy nubile human robots for evening entertainments that are n't subject to the usual restrictive laws , most hu-bots are used constructively . The U.S. has thousands of hu-bots in the emergency services alone . Equipped with infrared sensory enhancements , they compute optimal trajectories through smoke-filled buildings , calculating the maximum stress they can put on their bodies without concerns about pain or panic . <p> The human body is more physically dexterous and adaptable than any machine yet built . Interface some electronic controls to the basic human nervous system , and the result is a triumph of modem technology . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . <p> Maybe if I 'd been a better person , I would have sold her . I smoothed her hair back from her cheek , picked up her cold hand lying still on the sheet , squeezed it . <p> Only , only no one knew what the hu-bots felt inside , whether they ever wondered why they were trapped in bodies that no longer listened to them . The surgeons open up the subject 's skull , insert the electronics , use destructive gene therapy that wipes out many neuron links even as it halts any further degradation of the nervous system . Once the procedure is finished , the software has control of the mouth and eyes and muscles . <p> If there 's anyone left inside , they have no means to communicate , no way of asking what happened . <p> I let go of Clarissa 's hand , walked down the ward , past a dozen beds with other DIMS children . Beneath the surface disinfectant , the hospital smelled of aging brick walls riddled with damp . Half the blankets had holes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been there for two years , comatose for most of that time . An oversized orange duck nestled at the crook of his left arm , but that was just some adult 's sentimentality . Unlike the hu-bots , we can be virtually certain that third phase DIMS victims are oblivious to their surroundings , their intellect destroyed . <p> I paced back to Clarissa , stared at the ragged-ear rabbit at the bottom of her bed . There was a promise I 'd broken . <p> While she could still understand , I did my best to explain DIMS to Clarissa . She wanted to see how it would change her , but of course there were no advanced DIMS cases in New York  --  they 'd all been upgraded . So we watched a video together on an antiquated VCR , white static flickering across the picture . The boy on the tape forgot the words for knife , and baseball , and the name of his sister . He stumbled when saying Mommy ; a ribbon of drool tracked down his shirt ; his arms quivered like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape , scrunched up her fists . With careful precision she said slowly , " I do n't want ever to be like that . Do n't let that happen to me . " <p> " Hush , now . " I had folded her against me , rocked her . <p> " Mummy , I mean it . Please do n't let it happen . I 'd rather be a robot . " <p> " I wo n't let it happen , I wo n't . " <p> But I lied . I kept telling myself that tomorrow I 'd take Clarissa to Electrosim . I 'd stipulate in the contract that her body was not to be sold to a private buyer , but instead used in one of the humanitarian projects . <p> And then tomorrow had slipped into the day after , and the day after that . Congress passed the bill that rendered upgrading compulsory , and I had fled here to London . <p> I took one last look at Clarissa lying in the bed , walked to the nurse 's station . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I signed the paper . The doctor came . They wheeled Clarissa to a private room , slipped the needle into the thin blue vein of her wrist . <p> I decided to stay in London . There was a voluntary organization that helped parents of DIMS children , and I even joined a local environmental group . I kept myself busy , but the loneliness grew . Even my memory of Clarissa blurred , until I could n't recall the shape of her eyes , the texture of her hair . <p> One afternoon in November , I went to London Zoo and stood by the bear enclosure . The keeper was throwing food , and I watched the bears snag carrots and apples in mid-flight . I remembered Clarissa crouching down beside me , the warmth of her body against my legs , the way the weak sunlight gilded her hair . <p> And day by day , the memories returned to me , bringing back the wholeness of Clarissa 's life , an unexpected benison . <p> <p> By Mary Soon Lee <p> Mary Soon Lee has lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she was raised in England .
