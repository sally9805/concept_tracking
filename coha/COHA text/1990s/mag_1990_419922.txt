Amplifications Continuing Notes on the Land Ethic <p> The grim consequences of the drought of 1988 were evident early that summer . Sizzling crops , desperate farmers , rising food prices , grounded barges , threatened drinking water supplies  --  if we did n't feel such effects firsthand , the media daily brought more pessimistic forecasts and worrisome images . The most troubling reports came from atmospheric scientists . With a certain I-told-you-so self-assurance , the researchers suggested that the drought was concrete evidence of global warming  --  a predicted result of the " greenhouse effect . " One ominous projection by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) , broadcast on television , depicted with dazzling state-of-the-art computer graphics an inexorably catastrophic scenario , in which vast swaths of the earth 's land mass seemed to be burning up by the early decades of the next century . <p> By the summer of 1988 there was widespread public recognition of the dismaying chain of climatic events that is apparently turning up the earth 's thermostat : increased burning of fossil fuels and the destruction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methane , thereby trapping the radiant heat of the sun . The scientists explained the phenomenon ( and others equally disturbing , such as the destruction of the earth 's ozone layer ) with such confidence and their technical wizardry was so impressive , one almost forgot that they were describing a slow-motion apocalypse  --  an apocalypse quietly creeping up day by day , brought on by our own substantial intervention in natural processes . <p> While the scientists declared the drought a sure harbinger of global warming , environmentalists used the crisis to renew their faltering campaigns for energy conservation and the development of renewable energy resources . Likewise , nuclear-power advocates experienced fresh hope for that economically and environmentally troubled technology . By a facile exercise of logic , they declared nuclear-generated energy to be safe and desirable because the burning of fossil fuels is dangerous . Editorialists and pundits of all ideological persuasions had a field day , pointing fingers and sounding portentous alarms . <p> George Perkins Marsh , a man of the world , would not have been surprised by all the ruckus and rhetoric . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence on what he once described as " the proper working of the great terraqueous machine . " <p> " The earth is fast becoming an unfit home for its noblest inhabitant , " he wrote in the introductory chapter of Man and Nature , his 1864 classic , " and another era of equal human crime and human improvidence , and of like duration with that through which traces of that crime and that improvidence extend , would reduce it to such a condition of impoverished productiveness , of shattered surface , of climatic excess , as to threaten the depravation , barbarism , and perhaps even extinction of the species . " <p> So far , more than a hundred and twenty-five years after Marsh 's warning first appeared in print , we have not yet succumbed to extinction  --  though some may feel that the verdict is not so clear on the questions of depravation and barbarism . In any event , it might not be too late , during these gradually warming days , to turn to some of the timeless and cautionary lessons George Perkins Marsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Physical Geography as Modified by Human Action . <p> If Man and Nature is " the fountainhead of the conservation movement , " as critic and historian Lewis Mumford once wrote , it is a safe bet that few but the most ardent of conservationists and the most dogged of graduate students make their way through Marsh 's dry , dense text today . But there is another reason besides archaic literary style that Marsh 's work and message are not better known and more readily heeded . Like many another neglected and unpopular prophet , Marsh urged his readers , individually and collectively , to take responsibility for the consequences of their actions . He asked his fellow citizens ( and Marsh was a prominent public figure who took seriously the duties of citizenship ) to take a clear-eyed look at how they lived , the better to mend their harmful ways . <p> Unlike many other prophets , though , Marsh was no fire-and-brimstone evangelist , no tub-thumping mountebank . His rhetoric was usually subdued , his profuse evidence marshalled with logic and precision , his conclusions equivocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Man and Nature reflected Marsh 's legal training , diplomatic background , and resolute faith in the powers of empirical observation and scientific investigation to reveal the path out of humanity 's environmental dilemma . <p> Marsh 's eyes were opened to the dynamics of nature , he once recalled , during a boyhood excursion across the countryside surrounding his Woodstock , Vermont , home . His father " called my attention to the general configuration of the surface ; pointed out the direction of the different ranges of hills ; told me how the water gathered on them and ran down their sides .... He stopped his horse on the top of a steep hill , bade me notice how the water flowed in different directions , and told me that such a point was called a watershed . " This simple but profound lesson in physical geography was the starting point for Marsh 's sweeping attempt to comprehend the relationship between human activity and natural processes . <p> Born in 1801 , Marsh attended Dartmouth College and was a self-taught lawyer Restless with the legal profession , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " bred sheep , ran awoolen mill , built roads and bridges , sold lumber , edited a newspaper , developed marble quarry , and speculated in real estate , " as biographer David Lowenthal summarized . In the 1840s Marsh served four terms as a Congressman from Vermont , during which time he was influential in the creation and administration the Smithsonian Institution . A five-year stint as U.S. Minister to Turkey provided him the opportunity to travel in Egypt and Palestine . In 1861 , Abraham Lincoln appointed Marsh to serve as American Minister in Italy , a post he held until his death in 1882 . <p> Throughout his life , Marsh , who read twenty languages , pursued a prodigicous variety of scholarly endeavors . His prolific writings included a treatise titled The Camel , based on his firsthand experiences with the creatures and his belief that they might be profitably used in the arid regions of the United States ; a groundbreaking Report on the Artificial Propagation of Fish prepared for the state of Vermont ; an Icelandic grammar ; a dictionary of English etymology ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he attempted to prove a then-popular and unabashedly racist theory that the virtues of American institutions and of the nation 's Puritan forebears could be traced to Germanic origins . <p> But Man and Nature ( retitled , in later editions , The Earth as Modified by Human Action ) was the masterwork , the synthesis of Marsh 's eclectic learning , extensive travels ) and varied experiences . Among the objects of the book , he wrote , besides chronicling " the extent of the changes produced by human action in the physical conditions of the globe we inhabit , " was " to illustrate the doctrine , that man is , in both kind and degree , a power of a higher order than any of the other forms of animated life , which , like him , ire nourished at the table of bounteous nature . " Marsh wrote and published Man and Nature at a time when the theological I certainty of the natural hierarchy was under attack ; the debate over the theory of evolution had only just begun ( Darwin 's Origin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such seemingly conflicting ideas about science and religion  --  at least to his own satisfaction . His book was a plea that humankind understand and accept its place as the supremely influential species in the global web of life . <p> Buttressed with the pages of evidence and example that comprise the bulk of Man and Nature , Marsh forcefully advanced his argument that humanity was not merely the passive object of geographical forces but the powerful , if usually unconscious , instigator of profound environmental transformations . " Man is everywhere a disturbing agent , " Marsh wrote . " Wherever he plants his foot , the harmonies of nature are turned to discords . " <p> Marsh composed much of the book in Italy , while the nation he represented was still in the throes of the Civil War and Italy itself was for the first time being governed as a unified nation . It was obvious enough , in his eyes , that history , political struggle , and the state of the natural environment were inextricably intertwined . The long introductory chapter of Man and Nature begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed to the downfall of the Roman Empire . Marsh 's parable of how the Romans laid waste their domain 's abundant natural endowments set the moral tone for the rest of his book . <p> From Rome he led his readers on a long excursion through time and history , ranging across landscapes from his Vermont hometown to the steppes of Russia , exploring " The Woods , " " The Waters , " and " The Sands , " as he titled the book 's three central chapters . His linguistic talents and his correspondence with many eminent scientists , scholars , and public figures of his era provided him access to an unusually wide array of sources . ( Indeed , some of the most interesting and pointed digressions in the book appear in his extensive footnotes . ) Marsh was a pioneer environmental historian . His aim was to sort out , describe , and interpret the complex ecological chains of cause and effect by which mankind had transformed the face of the landscape . And he had a talent for simplifying these connections . Marsh abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concise , vivid images that graphically dramatized his theme that there is " nothing small in nature . " Consider , for instance , how he distills the long arc of one region 's history into a single sentence : " Thus the earth loosened by the rude Abyssinian ploughshare , and washed down by the rain from the hills of Ethiopia which man has stripped of their protecting forests , contributes to raise the plains of Egypt , to shoal the maritime channels which lead to the city built by Alexander near the mouth of the Nile , and to fill up the harbors made famous by Phenecian sic commerce . " <p> With a skeptic 's eye , he compared conditions in his youthful native country with those in the long-settled lands of the Old World . His fellow Americans , he observed , were repeating many of the same mistakes whose grim outcomes could be read on the ravaged landscape of Europe and the Near East . " Let us be wise in time , and profit by the errors of our older brethren ! " Marsh warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted Americans had not yet had time to raze all their forests or to build extensive and vulnerable communities in river floodplains . <p> In the destruction of America 's forests , though , Marsh saw a disheartening flaw in the nation 's character . he concluded his chapter on forests with a short exhortation under the heading " Instability of American Life , " in which he posed a challenge still worth heeding : <p> All human institutions , associate arrangements , modes of life , have their characteristic imperfections . The natural , perhaps the necessary defect of ours , is their instability , their want of fixedness , not in form only , but even in spirit The face of physical nature in the United States shares this incessant fluctuation , and the landscape is as variable as the habits of the population . It is time for some abatement in the restless love of change which characterizes us , and makes us almost a nomade sic rather than a sedentary people We have now felled forest enough everywhere , in many districts far too much . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal proportions , and devise means of maintaining the permanence of its relations to the fields , the meadows , and the pastures , to the rain and the dews of heaven , to the springs and rivulets with which it waters the earth . The establishment of an approximately fixed ratio between the two most broadly characterized distinctions of rural surface : woodland and plough land  --  would involve a certain persistence of character in all the branches of industry , all the occupations and habits of life , which depend upon or are immediately connected with either , without implying a rigidity that should exclude flexibility of accommodation/to the many changes of external circumstances which human wisdom can neither prevent nor foresee , and would thus help us to become , more emphatically , a well-ordered and stable commonwealth and , not less conspicuously , a people of progress . <p> Marsh 's message , while well received by other scientists , scholars , and reformers of his era , had a limited immediate impact on a nation still hellbent on expansion , settlement , and the unrestrained exploitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold . Indeed , his penetrating discussion of the relationship between forest cover , soil erosion , and streamflow laid down the fundamental tenets of the American forestry and conservation movements of the early twentieth century . Third World deforestation today , and related wood shortages , soil erosion , and flooding , duplicate processes Marsh documented from the Old World 's long history and observed personally on the steep hillsides of Vermont . <p> Despite his exhaustive depiction of the careless and profligate ways of humanity , Marsh held out hope . No enemy of the public ownership and control of natural resources , he pointed to the stirrings of intelligent public regulation and restoration of forests in southern France and elsewhere in Europe . The diking , draining , and creation of land in Holland , he concluded , had been generally benign and successful . And he recounted the experience of the Italian province of Tuscany , which had long been engaged in an effort to prevent floods and restore lost agricultural lands through a flexible , imaginative program of rechannelling the region 's much-abused rivers . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landscape ; the only question for Marsh was whether the result would be beneficial or harmful to humans and their environment , whether such transformations would be pursued purely for private gain or for the commonweal . Marsh 's call for active , constructive rehabilitation of damaged landscapes anticipated today 's nascent " restoration ecology " movement . Moreover , he echoed the sentiments of those who now worry about the world 's exorbitant military expenditures . " The cost of one year 's warfare , if judiciously expended , " he wrote , " would secure , to almost every country that man has exhausted , an amelioration of climate , a renovated fertility of soil , and a general physical improvement , which might almost be characterized as a new creation . " <p> Influenced by the Transcendental spirit of his native New England , Marsh hewed to a faith that human beings might yet come to comprehend and appreciate their unique place in the natural order . And , in the spirit of his age , he believed in the virtues and benefits of scientific endeavor  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its potential to satisfy humanity 's most fundamental spiritual yearning . " The collection of phenomena must precede the analysis of them , " he concluded , " and every new fact , illustrative of the action and reaction between humanity and the material world around it , is another step toward the determination of the great question , whether man is of nature or above her . " <p> The questions Marsh posed in 1864 are fundamentally , if not always scientifically , identical to the ones that confront us today . The drought of 1988 , the dire prospect of global warming , and other recent environmental calamities , from floods in Bangladesh to the enormous oil spill in Alaska 's Prince William Sound  --  such phenomena dramatize the paradox Marsh well understood before there was a genuine conservation movement or a sophisticated scientific understanding of globe-encircling environmental processes : The technological and economic forces that provide valuable material benefits can also produce the very conditions that undermine the planet 's ability to sustain life . <p> The contemporary significance of Marsh 's observations will be evident to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild places . If , as he proclaimed , " a certain persistence of character " is a requisite for any hope of preserving a healthy , stable environmental order , the complexities of large-scale ecological forces can nonetheless confound the noblest of human intentions . On a globe blanketed with increasing amounts of carbon dioxide and soaking up acidified precipitation , wilderness has no real boundaries or protection , no matter if designated by law and depicted on a map . <p> His chapter on " Transfer , Modification , and Extirpation of Vegetable and of Animal Species " catalogued the ways human cultures affected the range , distribution , and survival of a multitude of life forms . His arguments in favor of preserving organisms and their habitats anticipated virtually every point made by environmentalists today  --  from the possible medical uses of little-known organisms and the protection of biological diversity to the spiritual and aesthetic value of undisturbed terrain . And in an era when species are swiftly being rendered extinct while genetic engineers simultaneously attempt to invent new organisms , Marsh 's warning about the ecological hubris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cogency . " We are never justified in assuming a force to be insignificant because its measure is unknown , or even because no physical effect can now be traced to it as its origin , " he wrote , neatly summarizing the challenge faced by today 's scientists as they attempt to understand the earth 's intricate atmospheric biological , and geographical processes . <p> " The equation of animal and vegetable life is too complicated a problem for human intelligence to solve , " Marsh wrote , " and we can never knocker how wide a circle we produce in the harmonies of nature when we throw the smallest pebble into the ocean of organic life . " As we continue throwing pebbles , we should also be keeping an eye stained on the horizon for the first signs of an environmental tidal wave . <p> The worldly Yankee author of Man and Nature , working in his study in a medieval castle near Turin , had a less provincial viewpoint than did many of his counterparts in the pantheon of American conversation history and literature . Marsh 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly as lyrical or inspirational as other American volumes of environmental scripture , such as Thoreau 's Walden , Muir 's The Mountains of California , or Leopold 's A Sand County Almanac . <p> Some students of the American conservation movement , in fact , pigeonhole Marsh as a " utilitarian , " who mistakenly places mankind at the center of terrestrial environmental affairs . His ideas , the critics say hinder the development of a biocentric , truly ecological understanding of huminity 's role in the natural scheme of things . Maybe so . Meanwhile , the news pours in and the scientific evidence piles up documenting the link between human activity and environmental degradation . Perhaps Marsh 's matter-of-fact candor , expansive perspective , profound historical awareness , and outright common sense accurately reflect the stark facts of life on the planet Earth in this epoch . <p> Indeed , in his clear-headed analysis of the challenge facing humanity in his time , George Perkins Marsh spelled out some of the indisputably human qualities that are equally necessary today as we plunge headlong into the future : humility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persistence of character , " and a forthright recognition that there is indeed " nothing small in nature .
