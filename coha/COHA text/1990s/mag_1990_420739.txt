Section : Business <p> An American hit maker is the big winner in Japan 's MCA deal <p> David Geffen had just gotten the of news that would have sent anyone else packing for a long , pleasant vacation . Entertainment giant MCA Inc. had agreed to be purchased by Japanese consumer-electronics conglomerate Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. for $6.6 billion  --  $8 billion if you count the corporate debt . Geffen , who sold his Geffen Records label to MCA just eight months ago for stock then worth $545 million , netted a cool $710 million for tendering his shares  --  far more than Michael Milken made in 1987 . <p> Yet instead of flying to Aruba  --  or buying Aruba , for that matter  --  Geffen was back on the job . At 7 a.m. the day the deal was announced last week , he phoned Eddie Rosenblatt , president of Geffen Records , to discuss the packaging for Peter Gabriel 's new CD  --  just the first call in his daily schmooze frenzy . Later in the week Geffen tried to get a visitor excited about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's The Simpsons . " It 's a really extraordinary record . You want to hear it ? " Geffen asks . " The Simpsons record for Geffen Records . " It seemed both to thrill and amuse him , this oddity that arose from a chat with Simpsons producer James Brooks . The title cut , " Do the Bartman , " opens with a voice-over that is pure Bart  --  and pure Hollywood . " I did n't do it . Nobody saw me do it . You ca n't prove it . " This is David Geffen 's vacation . As Bart raps on , Geffen is transported ... somewhere else , smiling his squinty smile and gently swaying his body in time to the music  --  " stoking the starmaker machinery behind the popular songs , " as Joni Mitchell wrote about him 16 years ago . <p> From Joni Mitchell to Rapmaster Bart ? In an industry known for evanescent careers , few have lasted so long and had such scope  --  and Geffen has also scored major successes in the movies ( " Beetlejuice " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saigon " ) . " Because I have a relatively short span of concentration , " he says , " I have many things which interest me . " The Matsushita deal makes Geffen , already the wealthiest entertainment figure on the Forbes 400 list , even richer . Geffen is n't just a beneficiary of the deal ; he 's one of Matsushita 's most important assets . And the behemoth has the resources to match all of Geffen 's varied interests . " He 's the sole , solitary , absolute and complete winner in this , " says Fox chairman Barry Diller , a friend . " Everyone else has some baggage . " <p> The deal makes Geffen 's new Japanese employer the biggest entertainment company in the world , a massive experiment in corporate synergy ( page 51 ) . MCA brings Universal Studios , movie theaters , theme parks , MCA records and publishing to the altar ; Matsushita mass-produces every conceivable electronic gadget , from Panasonic and Technics stereos to rice cookers and computers . The deal is the largest Japanese acquisition of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorny foreign-ownership questions that surrounded Sony 's nearly $5 billion purchase of Columbia Pictures in 1989 . <p> Just days after the sale was completed , Geffen did n't want to talk about the money . " Do n't you think it 's an obnoxious question , to talk about how much money someone has ? I do . " The most he would say was , " My bet on MCA has turned out to be a very lucrative bet . " He loves the bettor 's rush , and his wagers are measured in markers like money , platinum records , art , real estate and the admiration of rivals . " It 's exciting , " he says . " Every week it 's like a horse race . " But friends say yes , the money matters too . A lot . His first mentor , Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun , says , " David is both inquisitive and acquisitive . " Last October Geffen asked record mogul Irving Azoff , " Who better to be a billionaire than me ? " <p> Geffen 's success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some rivals say , more than alittle pushiness . " He 's both smarter and more driven than anybody else , " says rival Azoff . Geffen is also as quick as an Aero-smith guitar riff . " He 's pure instinct , " says Jon Landau , Bruce Springsteen 's manager and a friend for 20 years . Landau recalls once agonizing at length over his business options , and finally approaching Geffen for advice . Thirty seconds into his labored explanation of the problem , Geffen told Landau what to do . Landau tried to carry on with his explanation , but Geffen interrupted : " No ! Now do ! Stop thinking and do it ! " That kind of advice can be one benefit of Geffen 's friendship  --  but if he feels he 's been wronged , watch out . " He 's the best friend in the world to have , " Landau says , " and the worst enemy . " Azoff agrees . " You do n't want to get on his bad side , because the same energy he puts into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts himself into the equation . ' I believe perhaps even more strongly than David does that this is a business where you reward your friends and punish your , enemies . " <p> Final jewel : Geffen made enough friends  --  and dispensed with enough enemies  --  to make his first million by the age of 25 . He had flunked out of two colleges and drifted from job to job until finding his calling in the mail room of the William Morris agency  --  a job he got by lying about his college record . He began signing rock musicians and eventually formed the Asylum label . He sold that to Warner in 1972 for the headline-grabbing price of $7 million , staying to run Asylum and another Warner label . He persuaded chairman Steve Ross to give him a shot at Warner Bros. ' movie studio , an abortive stint that ended after a year . After leaving Warner , ' Geffen was diagnosed as having bladder cancer . He withdrew from the business for four years , slowed down , invested in real estate and began collecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been misdiagnosed. lie came back with his Geffen Records label , which eventually would boast bands ranging from Guns N ' Roses to Edie Brickell and New Bohemians , as well as former companion Cher . Associates noted that the abrasive kid from Brooklyn had mellowed , though he had lost none of his drive . Having made his label the third largest , with a record $200 million in sales , Geffen decided to cash in on a wave of industry consolidation . " He wanted to be the final jewel , " recalls Geffen 's New York lawyer , Allen Grub-man . After a bidding war that included Britain 's Thorn EMI and ( at one stage ) Time Warner , he joined forces with MCA , whose musical strengths complemented his own . <p> MCA , the company that had produced such hits as " E.T. , " had long been looking for deep-pocketed partners , and Matsushita 's plans for it had already begun when Geffen came on board . The dealmaker behind the Sale was Michael Ovitz , the powerful and intensely private head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " software consultant , " he helped settle the Sony deal . Soon after , Matsushita approached Ovitz . In November 1989 , Ovitz flew to Hawaii to meet with Matsushita 's No. 2 , Masahiko Hirata , who signed him on as a consultant . After reviewing the entertainment industry , only two companies really made sense for Matsushita : Paramount and MCA , with MCA far ahead . As Matsushita had been for many yearn , it was conservatively run by a strong patriarch  --  the venerable Lew Wasserman . <p> The four months of talks began in August . Price was n't seriously discussed until late in the game  --  Nov. 19 , the morning after a formal summit dinner in New York . The parties were widely divided . Earlier , MCA 's execs had hoped to see $90 or even $100 per share , and by some accounts , Ovitz had promised $75 . ( Ovitz denies this . ) Frenetic negotiation by Ovitz and middleman Robert Strauss , as well as Herbert Allen for Matsushita and Felix Bohatyn for MCA , barely budged either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Thanksgiving  --  but urged Allen to push MCA , or lose the deal . Ovitz pressed Matsushita to up its offer to $66 and stock ; weary MCA , facing dim prospects in a slowing economy , accepted . The two sides negotiated through the holiday weekend . At 9:15 a.m . Monday the deal was signed , and the negotiators groggily sipped champagne to celebrate . <p> As soon as the sale was announced , the comparisons to Sony 's previous purchase of Columbia began . Matsushita is known in Japan as a copycat , and it appears to have learned from the leader 's mistakes . Some analysts say Sony overpaid for Columbia ; the more conservative Matsushita kept a hard line on price . Matsushita was also after more steady creative talent than Sony , which parted ways with the flamboyant Walter Yetnikoff as head of its CBS Records unit and took a gamble on the fiery duo of Jon Peters and Peter Guber as Columbia 's leaders . MCA 's respectable films and records  --  as well as Geffen 's proven ' success  --  lead many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Matsushita got a steal , and Sony got stuck , " says one investment manager . <p> What does the MCA sale mean to David Gefen , besides a fatter bank account ? His job description does n't change  --  although he 's rumored to be a candidate for the top MCAjob after Lew Wasserman retires . But second-in-command Sidney Sheinberg is officially next in line for the job and Ovitz is also a likely pick . Geffen says his hands are full with his own label . " Ninety-one will be the biggest year in our history , " Gefen says , projecting a stunning $300 million in sales based on new albums coming from his strongest acts . He has started a new label , DGC , for new talent , and signed pop gospel singer Amy Grant 's manager for another label , Reunion . With Matsushita 's bankroll , MCA is primed for a buying spree  --  a role tailored to Geffen 's recruiting skills . So few industry figures believe Geffen will stay quiet for long . " To think he 's not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seymour Stein , head of Sire Records . " Wherever David is , he calls the shots . Titles are meaningless for the most part . " Will he take a larger role in the movie business at MCA ? Contractually , he ca n't  --  yet . " For the moment , I have deals with Warner Bros. for films and theater , " he says . <p> ' Good buy ' : In the meantime , he continues the renovations of the old Jack Warner mansion on 10 acres in Beverly Hills , which he bought for $47.5 million after completing the MCA sale . Geffen says he knocked the cost down by bundling off the antique art and fUrnishings to auction houses  --  and selling Warner 's leather-bound film scripts and Oscar statuettes to Warner Bros. for $3 million . He thinks his final price is about $36 million  --  " a very good buy . " But he 's not sure he will leave his present home in Malibu .
