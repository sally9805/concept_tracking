" But you do n't understand ! " says a man in his mid-forties  --  a firm-jawed sort , about six feet tall , wearing the expensive casual weekend clothes of an upper-middle-management honcho . He is pleading his case to a woman in a ticket booth under a carved wooden sign that says HOWDY , PARDNER at the Roy Rogers-Dale Evans Museum , alongside Interstate 15 in Victorville , California . " You simply do not understand , " he repeats . " I drove two thousand miles from Chicago with this picture , and it is n't fair for you to tell me I ca n't meet Roy Rogers and have him sign it . " He waves a faded eight-by-ten photograph from 1950 that shows the cowboy movie star atop a beautiful golden palomino galloping at breakneck speed . He slides the picture under the grate and the ticket seller slides it right back to him , explaining that Mr. Rogers is not at the museum this morning . After a few more thrusts and parries the man begins to have what is seldom described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " I want to see Roy Rogers , I want to see Roy Rogers , " he whimpers , pouting and stomping his foot . Grown men and women acting like children is a daily event at the Roy Rogers-Dale Evans Museum . At the edge of the Mojave Desert , a third of the way from Los Angeles to Las Vegas , this roadside attraction is an emotional lodestone for the progeny of midcentury America , in whom Roy and Dale and their wonder horses , Trigger and Buttermilk , provoke a tumble of memory and sentiment . For adults seeking a reminder of what life was like half a century ago , Roy and Dale 's museum makes it easy to recall an era when popular culture was sweet and decent and the good guys always wore white hats . Now in their eighties and waging battles with serious heart problems , Roy Rogers and Dale Evans remain heroes to yesterday 's children . They live at their ranch in Apple Valley , about seven miles from Victorville , and on mornings when he feels well enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shake their hands . During his off hours , when he is browsing at his favorite local swap meet , or on his way home to catch the TV soap opera The Guiding Light , which he has followed for years , he wears a baseball cap and a windbreaker . But Roy Rogers never appears at his museum outfitted other than as the man he refers to as " Ol ' Roy "  --  the most beloved singing cowboy in the history of movies , and arguably the best dressed . To greet his fans Ol ' Roy wears a white Stetson hat , double creased around the rim of the crown and with a rakish sloping brim . He fancies beautiful gabardine cowboy shirts festooned with embroidered horseshoes or flowers on the yoke . To hold up the western-cut trousers that still fit him perfectly some forty years after they were made by the celebrated cowboy couturier Nudie of Hollywood , he chooses a gleaming silver-and-leather belt made by Edward Bohlin , who was known in his day as the Michelangelo of saddlecraft . Ol ' Roy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of his neck and a pair of glossy cowboy boots with pointed toes and high heels on his feet . " He is very serious about Ol " Roy , " explains Roy Rogers Jr .  --  or " Dusty , " as he likes to be called . Dusty runs the museum and has also handled his dad 's career since Art Rush , his father 's manager for forty-six years , died , a few years ago . " He says people come here and they expect to see Ol ' Roy . Dad 's legs were bothering him recently , so I tried to get him to wear Reeboks or walkers , but he would n't do it . He said people expect to see Roy in boots , not sneakers . He is very protective of that image . It 's important to him because , he says , all you have in life is your word , your handshake , and the image you portray . There 's no difference between Ol ' Roy and my dad . It 's just that Ol ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appearance at the museum , strange things happen . A burly six-footer spots him and rushes him , forgetting that he himself is no longer eight years old and that Roy is eighty-one . He hugs the old man , lifting him off the ground with the power of his embrace , laughing with glee . Suddenly he realizes what he has done ; he puts Roy down , turns sheepishly to his wife and teenage children , and introduces his boyhood hero . A policeman shows up one morning and explains that when he was growing up , his father was an abusive drunk . Roy Rogers was his model when he could n't find one at home . " Even today , " he says , " when I am faced with a predicament on the job , I ask myself , What would Roy Rogers do ? " Women in their fifties complain to Roy because he married Dale Evans , on New Year 's Eve in 1947 . " You were supposed to wait for me to grow up ! " they tell him . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , able only to recite a now-familiar litany : " When I was a kid , I had a Roy Rogers lunch box , a Roy Rogers bedspread , a Roy Rogers wristwatch ... " Many people who come to the museum have heard that there is a good chance they will meet Roy if they arrive in the morning . The pilgrims ' goal is something more than a brush with celebrity ; for most of them , Roy and Dale were part of growing up , maybe the best part . When the couple were box-office stars , they represented everything good about the western myth  --  adventure , romance , and fair play . It is a heroic image they maintain to this day , and although they have not appeared together in a movie or a Wild West show or on a regular television program since the early 1960s , they still exert a powerful pull on people 's heartstrings . They were billed as King of the Cowboys and Queen of the West , and yet their meaning has always gone beyond those roles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The life they have shared , on display in their museum for the price of an admission ticket , is n't only about the West ; it is about America , and when you enter the quiet halls in which their mementos are displayed , the idealized nation they once exemplified comes whirling back to mind in a rush of sentiment . Today one does n't hear much about Roy and Dale 's America  --  a country of small towns , family farms , fraternal halls , church picnics , and Fourth of July parades , a country in which members in good standing of the Roy Rogers Riders Club promised to obey these rules : 1 . Be neat and clean . 2 . Be courteous and polite . 3 . Always obey your parents . 4 . Protect the weak and help them . 5 . Be brave but never take chances . 6 . Study hard and learn all you can . 7 Be kind to animals and care for them . 8 . Eat all your food and never waste any . 9 . Love God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect our flag and our country . From the outside the museum does not look like it will set off emotional tremors . It resembles the frontier fort in the TV sitcom F Troop , or perhaps a steak house  --  a square wooden stockade with two low guard towers at opposite corners , surrounded by an immense parking lot . The front door is guarded by a thirty-foot painted plaster replica of Trigger rearing up on his hind legs , facing north . The white-maned palomino has been reproduced in anatomically correct detail ; in the barren parking lot , where the eye has nowhere else to go , you can not but acknowledge that Trigger was , as Roy still likes to brag , " A stallion to the day he died . " If the Rogers family had given the job of assembling their artifacts to a professional curator , their museum would likely have been very different , perhaps more like Gene Autry 's . Autry , the other most renowned singing cowboy , opened a fine Western Heritage Museum in Los Angeles five years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all handsomely displayed in a splendid building with names of benefactors and patrons along one gleaming wall . Roy and Dale 's place is , to say the least , very different . " This is n't really a regular museum , " Roy says of the treasure house he dreamed of creating almost from the time he started in movies , in the 1930s . " It 's a personal museum . It 's things that Dale and I have done , and the kids and the family and Trigger . I was born and raised in an area where people did n't have anything . I got a pocket knife for Christmas and made all my own toys with it : slingshots , whistles , things like that . So when I grew up and started getting things , I could n't get rid of them . The drawers would fill up with stuff , and Dale would say , " Honey , when are you going to empty them ? ' What I did was put everything in a box and send it off to Bekins Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about twenty-five years ago , I had two big truckloads of stuff . " The museum 's original location was Apple Valley ; it was moved to Victorville in 1976 . In all that time the collection has never stopped growing . Today the exhibit space is packed with mementos , and Dusty Rogers says that there are many more things in storage than there are on display . Dusty is the " curator "  --  a term that even he chuckles at . Along with Roy and Dale , he decides what objects will go into the dioramas and glass cases , rearranging the exhibits when he gets tired of the way they look or when his dad acquires something else , which frequently happens on weekends when Roy goes to the Victorville swap meet . Dusty says , " I come into my office on Monday and there will be some little table made out of burl wood that somebody handcrafted , or a model ship with the rigging all torn up . Dad will say , " Somebody built that with his own two hands . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth it . ' ' " Everything in this museum is presented not with apology or pretense ( or in any apparent logical order ) but with absolute sincerity . A lifetime of stuff sings of the heights of Hollywood renown and also , among the benign ephemera , reveals excruciating family tragedies . THIS IS OUR LIFE , announces a varnished wooden sign with carved gold letters at the museum 's entryway . The welcome is flanked by a picture of Roy tipping his hat and one of Dale smiling . This museum is their life  --  an epic autobiography in which nothing is withheld . There are grand things , including a $50,000 silver-and-gold parade saddle , and little ones , including a half-used bottle of 6-12 bug repellent saved from a long-ago family camping trip . A picture of Roy 's grizzled sidekick Gabby Hayes at age nineteen , playing the role of King Lear , is preserved a few cases away from a stunned-looking taxidermized golden eagle that Roy 's band , The Sons of the Pioneers , found electrocuted under a high-voltage line . The band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've lived through so much , " he says . " When I walk through the museum , I get about a quarter of the way and get so tired just seeing where I 've been . " A few of the things you see just past the entryway are Roy 's first cowboy boots , in bronze ; his first guitar ( not bronzed ) ; a wedding photo of Roy and his first wife , Arlene ( Dusty 's natural mother , who died of a brain embolism a few days after he was born , in 1946 ) ; a collection of several dozen wristwatches that Roy has owned over the years ( nothing too fancy  --  some Rolexes , but also a lot of 1970s Seiko digitals , all piled up together ) ; a hunk of the Berlin Wall ; some dollar bills folded into funny origami shapes ; a little statue of a pig ; and a selection of pretty glass vases . Just beyond these memorabilia are cases containing Roy and Dale 's tributes to their three children who died . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what you will find  --  which makes it a lot like real life , and the most personal and intimate museumgoing experience imaginable . Dale have had nine children altogether . When they fell in love , a few years after co-starring in The Cowboy and the Senorita in 1944 , he was a widower with three youngsters , and she had a son from her first marriage , which she had entered into at age fourteen in Arkansas . A couple of years after they were married , Dale , who was then thirty-seven , gave birth to their daughter Robin Elizabeth , who suffered from severe Downs syndrome . Flouting the conventional wisdom of the time , which was to place Robin in an institution ( or at least not to let their fans know about the imperfect child ) , they kept Robin with them as part of the family until she died , a few days before her second birthday . Her case in the museum  --  identified " Robin Elizabeth Rogers : 1950-1952 "  --  contains pictures of her as a frail blonde baby ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory book , and a well-worn stuffed animal from her crib . Next to Robin 's case are the personal effects of Deborah Lee Rogers , an adopted Korean orphan who died at age twelve in a bus crash on a church trip . Pictures of Debbie show her with her friends wearing silly hats and grinning . Her dolls lean alongside a letter from President Dwight Eisenhower expressing his sadness on learning of her death . Then there is a tribute to John L David " Sandy " Rogers , an abused boy whom they adopted after one of Roy 's many goodwill trips to orphanages . A picture of Sandy shows him shortly after he came to live with them , wearing a plaid shirt with a souvenir Roy Rogers and Trigger necktie , his nose still twisted to the side from the beatings he had received before Roy and Dale rescued him . Next to his picture is a letter he wrote to them in 1965 , not long after he left home and joined the Army , explaining that someday he would like to raise a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the triangularly folded American flag from his Army coffin . Near the children 's memorials are large artificial-flower arrangements . A plastic yucca plant honors the couple 's home in Apple Valley , and an arrangement of golden poppies set into a wicker floor stand is labeled as an homage to the state of California and to the golden palomino Trigger . The ripples of Roy and Dale 's life spread wider and wider as you continue through the museum . Many things are what you would expect in a movie stars ' reliquary : the fabulous clothes they wore in their traveling rodeo ; hundreds of Roy and Dale magazine covers and comic books ; licensed toys and souvenirs , including a humming lariat and a ten-cent-a-ride mechanical Trigger ; publicity pictures from their movies and their singing career ; awards ranging from California Mother of the Year ( Dale , 1967 ) to Honorary American Indian of the Year ( Roy , who has Choctaw blood , 1986 ) to membership in the Cowboy Hall of Fame ( Roy and Dale , 1976 ) . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening dress , and a picture of her a few years later reclining glamorously on a couch for test shots at Twentieth-Century Fox . Some of Roy 's favorite vehicles are parked among the artifacts , including a chartreuse 1964 Lincoln convertible with a sign on its trunk saying I DROVE THIS CAR ALMOST 100,000 MILES  --  ROY ROGERS ; the 1923 Dodge that Roy 's father owned ; and Nellybelle , the cantankerous Jeep once driven by Roy 's sidekick Pat Brady . Here , too , are some other celebrities ' things , which Roy somehow acquired over the years : Hoot Gibson 's piano , Tom Mix 's shirt , chairs once sat in by Clark Gable and William S. Hart , a souvenir Hopalong Cassidy milk glass . There are letters of affection to Roy and Dale from every American President since Truman and from political and religious leaders all over the world . Among such glittering star memorabilia are frequent unexpected displays showing the many ways in which the life Roy and Dale have lived is typically American . One set of shelves holds Roy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ El Zagal , and other fraternal temples around the country . There are Roy 's 4-H Club blue ribbons for Swine Showmanship in 1927 , 1928 , and 1929 , and a picture of him with Martha Washington , his prizewinning sow . A large case is devoted to Roy 's favorite pastime , bowling : it contains his shirts , his scorecard from the time he rolled a 667 series , pictures of his team , and favorite bowling balls , including one sparkling clear-plastic beauty with a replica of Trigger ' s head embedded in its core . HOW ABOUT A LOOK INSIDE ROY 'S PERSONAL TACKLE BOX ? asks a sign above one display , which shows a nice array of " baby hellbenders " and " pal o " mine " lures . The Rogers family 's dining table ( a round one with a lazy Susan in the center ) is set with china bearing western brands and a large Bible . Above the table in this diorama is a big picture of Jesus . The single most popular attraction in the museum is Trigger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At closing time it is not unusual for late-arriving tourists to beg the cashier to be allowed just five minutes to run in and see him . He is in a glass case along with Dale 's buckskin horse , Buttermilk , and the couple 's German shepherd , Bullet . Trigger is big and serious-looking , preserved for all time rearing up on his hind legs , wearing a gleaming silver saddle . His upkeep is Dusty Rogers 's responsibility , and it involves brushing the dust off his glass eyes , shining his saddle , and having him sprayed occasionally for bugs . To groom his golden hide Dusty uses Dale 's old natural-bristle crumb brush . " I could talk about Trigger forever , " Roy says with true emotion . " He was one of the greatest horses that ever came along . He was just terrific . I made all those pictures and all those TV shows with him ; we ran through everything and he never once fell with me . He was just so sharp . He liked to perform in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him he would n't do . He walked up stairs in hospitals to visit the sick children . He was so gentle I used to put all my kids on him at one time , from his neck clear back to his tail . I insisted that Trigger get star billing in all my pictures . After all , what 's a cowboy without a horse ? " The museum abounds with as many pictures of Trigger as of the rest of the family : Trigger and Roy in Hawaii ( Trigger wears a gigantic lei ) , Trigger coming down a special gangplank from a KLM jetliner , Trigger making funny lips and kissing Roy , and , of course , Trigger rearing up heroically on his hind legs as Roy waves his hand in the air  --  the iconic pose of cowboy jubilation which is imprinted on the minds of a generation . Trigger was thirty-three when he died , in 1965 . " I got a call on July the third , at five o'clock in the morning , " Roy recalls . " I recognized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danny , old Trigger died , did n't he ? ' I had had a premonition , because Trigger was getting old . He ate that morning , and he was turned out in the pasture , and just a few minutes later he was lying down in the field . There was n't any dirt kicked up or anything . I just could n't put him in the ground , so I sent him to old man Bischoff , in Los Angeles , to be mounted . They did a good job . I still ca n't hardly walk past him in the museum without getting tears in my eyes . " The Smithsonian Institution had wanted Trigger when he died , but Roy could n't let him go . " I once joked that I 'd told Dale that when T die . she should just skin me and put me up on Trigger , and I could smile down at the people from now on . " When he was a young boy , Roy dreamed of becoming a movie cowboy . Born Leonard Slye , in Cincinnati @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters in " the last house in the holler " in Duck Run , Ohio , where his boyhood ambition was to become a dentist . It seemed a glamorous and necessary profession , especially to a person who to this day remembers the country custom of getting a molar yanked out while someone 's knee was in his chest . " When I made enough money in pictures , one of the first things I did was to get myself some jaw teeth . It was a long time before I got a chance to buy these . " Roy proudly hoists the detachable bridgework out of his mouth to show us his manmade choppers . Who were his heroes when he was growing up ? " My horse , Babe , and my mule , Barney . Babe was an ex-sulky racer , and boy , I thought I had it made . I rode her to school and I rode her to church . First , though , I learned to ride with my mule : old Barney , he was my buddy . I just loved him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't know anybody else but them . I knew we had a President , because I learned that in school , but we did n't even have a radio , and I sure never got to see the cowboy stars back then . " After raising pigs and chickens on the family farm , Roy took a job working alongside his father in the insole department at the U.S. Shoe Company , in Cincinnati . His oldest sister had moved to California , and in 1930 , flush with ninety dollars he had saved , Roy convinced his father that they should quit their jobs and drive west . " We stayed four months and then went back to Ohio . Winter was coming , and I never could stand cold weather , so I said " Happy Trails " to my dad and hitchhiked back to California . I 've been here ever since . " One thing Roy Rogers remembers vividly about the start of his career is how hungry he was . During his early years as a singer of cowboy ballads , he recalls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Arizona , and Texas , and we got to Roswell , New Mexico . We did n't have a dime . So we got on a little radio station , and I came up with the idea to talk about our favorite things to eat , thinking maybe some listener would send us something . I said I liked lemon pie , and we got a phone call at the station from a fella who said that if I would sing " The Swiss Yodel , " his sister would bring a lemon pie to our motor court that night . By golly , I sang " The Swiss Yodel " better than I ever did , and sure enough , that night a car pulled up and there were not one but two pies ! Man , we could n't wait for them folks to leave so we could eat those pies ! " When Roy tells this story , his eyes still sparkle with delight , and when he describes the pies he got , he shows the height of their meringue by holding one hand high in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggles to stand up from the couch where he 's been sitting . He wobbles a little when he gets to his feet , the way eighty-one-year-olds sometimes do . But the person talking about the lemon pie does n't seem at all like an old man . Inside him is the heart of an all-American boy . When he describes the scheme he concocted to get the pies , and when you see the impish way his face creases when he remembers how good it felt to scratch the elemental itch of hunger , you realize that in some significant way Roy Rogers has never aged . He still radiates all the rapture and expectation of boyhood . It is that eternal boyishness that made him such a good King of the Cowboys fifty years ago and that makes him , even at age eighty-one , such a fitting symbol of a young America in which all things were possible . His career as a singer started slowly . When he came to California in 1930 , he made ends meet by picking peaches . A song recital on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join The Rocky Mountaineers , a group that performed regularly on the air for glory rather than money . In 1935 he formed The Pioneer Trio , soon known as The Sons of the Pioneers , which specialized in such sentimental cowboy ballads as " There 's a Round-up in the Sky " and " Moonlight on the Prairie . " That year The Sons of the Pioneers appeared in Gene Autry 's first big picture , Tumbling Tumbleweeds . Singing cowboys were suddenly hot , so when Gene Autry made it clear to Republic Pictures that he expected significantly more money the next time he signed a contract , Republic started looking for another headliner . Leonard Slye heard about the audition in a hat shop while getting his ten-gallon Stetson cleaned . He beat out seventeen other singing cowboys and got the job , at $75 a week . Republic gave him a new name , Dick Weston ; but when his first starring role , in Under Western Stars , was being planned , in 1938 , that name was discarded in favor of Roy Rogers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as having " a drawl like Gary Cooper and a smile like Shirley Temple " ; but Republic was so concerned that he appeared to be squinting that they suggested he put drops in his eyes to widen them . A flood of letters made it clear that fans adored the crinkly cowboy expression in Roy Rogers 's eyes . The movie going public cast their votes , and he went on to make eighty-seven cowboy movies by 1951 , when he moved to television . In 1943 Republic Pictures dubbed him King of the Cowboys . Roy fell in love with the person who had made the lemon pies  --  Arlene Wilkins  --  and married her in 1936 , one year before signing his contract at Republic . He was a family man from the start , and when it appeared that he and Arlene could n't have a child , they adopted one , Cheryl Darlene . Then , as sometimes happens , Arlene became pregnant , giving birth to Linda Lou Rogers in 1943 ; Dusty was born in 1946 . After Roy and Dale were married , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a Scottish foster child named Marion . " I always wanted a big family , " Roy explains . " Every time I 'd go on the road , I 'd play orphanages and children 's hospitals and places like that . No wonder I wound up with so many . " Roy and Dale now have sixteen grandchildren and twenty-six great-grandchildren . " And I 'm close to having a great-great-grandchild , " Roy says , beaming . " Except for Dusty , none of my kids went into show business , and none of them have any horses . " In a moment of reflection he says , " I think it goes back to when they were little . They would never say it , but I was on Trigger all the time , making pictures . Horses took me away from them . " Even during his twelve-year reign as the nation 's top-box-office cowboy , when he appeared on a Life magazine cover and was a favorite of the gossip columnist Louella Parsons , who declared him to have " the best behind in show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie star . " I did n't like those Hollywood parties , " he recalls . " The studio insisted I go to them for publicity , but I could n't figure out for the world how to enjoy it . I ca n't sit down and talk to someone I do n't know . So the next time I was invited , I asked if I could take a friend , and they said sure , thinking I would be bringing someone glamorous with me . But instead I took my two or three good hunting buddies . We sat in the corner and talked about hunting , and then I had a good time . " Roy Rogers and Dale Evans have been married for almost forty-six years and are about to celebrate their fiftieth year together in show business . When she enters the room , his eyes light up as brightly as they do when he remembers lemon pie . " Come on in , Mother , " he says to Dale , who arrives fresh from the beauty parlor . Her tresses are the color of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink-white skin remains unlined . The Queen of the West herself does almost all the shopping and cooking and laundry at the Rogers home . " When we were younger , with me working and all the kids , we had to have help . But I spent so much time when I was off my horse arbitrating between the help that I vowed I would never do it again . " When you talk to Roy Rogers and Dale Evans , even when Roy is outfitted in King of the Cowboys regalia , it is easy to think of them the way they think of themselves  --  as normal folks who just happened to have some good luck in their careers . At the peak of their movies ' popularity , in the late 1940s and early 1950s , Roy had more than 2,000 fan clubs in America and around the world , and 400 licensed products bore Roy and Dale 's names and images ; they set the all-time box-office record at Madison Square Garden and were the only couple ever chosen as Grand Marshals of the Tournament of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dale never changed or felt the need to be reclusive . " Mom and Dad are very public people , " Dusty Rogers says . " We 've always been accessible . never walled up our house . I remember times when folks would just find us in Apple Valley and come knocking on the door . There would be Mom in her bathrobe and slippers . One guy asked if she was the housekeeper . One time Dad came down in the morning and found strangers sitting in the living room . They said , " Hi , Roy , we 're from West Virginia , and figured you would n't mind . ' Dad made them coffee and they yakked awhile . " Dusty Rogers long ago grew accustomed to having parents who belonged to the public , having grown up , as he puts it , " sharing my mom and dad with twenty-five million other kids . " Today some of Roy 's honorary heirs include the country-music headliners Randy Travis , Clint Black , K. T. Oslin , and Emmylou Harris , who teamed up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top country stars in 1991 for an album of cowboy songs called Tribute , on which the highlight was them all joining in on Dale 's composition " Happy Trails , " Roy and Dale 's theme song since their TV show began , in 1951 . Victorville has grown since the Roy Rogers-Dale Evans Museum opened there . Restaurant franchises and strip malls stretch out toward the desert Just as in Los Angeles , graffiti mars walls and homeless drifters panhandle in supermarket parking lots . Amid the rudeness of the modern world , Roy and Dale , as always , draw their comfort from life at home . They prefer watching old movies on their large-screen TV to going out to see current pictures  --  which , Roy says , " are so bloody and filled with cussing , I would n't let Trigger see them . " They spend a fair amount of time worrying about the daily doings of their cat , a tabby named Charlie . " When he 's in , we worry that he , should go out ; when he 's out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amused by the small concerns that are so absorbing in old age . Sometimes Roy and Dale come to their museum in the early morning , before the visitors arrive , and wander through it , looking at the collection of mementos that symbolize their long life together , and remembering the America of high hopes and happy trails over which they once so graciously reigned . <p>
