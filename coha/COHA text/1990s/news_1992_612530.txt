<p> Mayor Maynard Jackson 's decision to revoke the liquor license of the Cotton Club and The Point exemplifies the trend of avoiding personal responsibility for our actions . <p> I am in no way suggesting that Mayor Jackson is in any way responsible for the Jan. 13 , 1991 , death of 20-year-old Michael Adams . His decision , however , was at best reactionary and clearly based on thin evidence . <p> Mr. Adams irresponsibly chose to drink to excess and this decision led to tragedy . To punish third parties who may have served Adams is ludicrous and does nothing to address the real culprit - irresponsible abuse of alcohol . <p> Society unfortunately fails to recognize that alcohol is a drug that causes more tragedy and death in America each year than any other . Perhaps if we rejected the notion that drinking to excess is a necessary rite of passage , more people would not feel the need to drink . When I was 20 , many of my peers viewed drinking to excess as a sign of masculinity . Today , several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case of a greedy merchant selling booze to a 15-or 16- year-old with peach fuzz on his face . Mo one made this man drink until his blood alcohol level hovered at nearly twice the legal limit . Depriving these two men of the ability to make a living does nothing to address the real problem we face . <p> Recent articles reported on the the loss of the Cotton Club 's and the Point 's liquor licenses , and Atlanta politicians ' attempts to make the owners of these establishments scapegoats for the unfortunate death of Michael Adams . <p> I am almost 29 and have attended approximately two dozen shows at the two clubs , and their employees have never failed to check my ID . <p> From what I understand of the facts , Mr. Adams did the vast majority of his drinking earlier , and his patronage of the Cotton Club was not a relevant factor in his tragic accident . <p> While I feel for Mr. Adams 's family 's loss , the sad truth is that Michael Adams was an adult who chose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the consequences of his own actions . <p> If politicians such as Maynard Jackson and Eldrin Bell feel compelled to find scapegoats , they may do better to look a little closer to home for culpability . <p> Mr. Bell may want to ask himself why one of his own officers did not arrest a visibly drunk citizen causing a disturbance at 2:30 a.m. for disorderly conduct or public intoxification . <p> A recent letter concerning the use of cable snares for trapping beaver in Georgia suggested that the board members of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources hold the power of life and death for Georgia 's wild and free animals . <p> This statement requires clarification . The board listens to the wildlife biologists and wildlife management personnel with DNR to establish a needs analysis . These professionals leave out the emotional side of the issue and deal with the sometimes harsh facts about wildlife management . <p> Without some form of animal control , and without the expertise of wildlife management , we would be faced with an overpopulation of wild animals , which would run rampant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this state are the most regulated of all the users of wildlife resources . For years , game management and the trapping industry have been trying to come up with more efficient means of animal control . So far they have only improved on already efficient methods , the foothold trap and the cable snare . <p> Numerous states use snares as a means of nuisance and predator animal control , now the trappers and game management personnel in Georgia will also be able to use these tools . <p> In opposition to a June 13 letter , the U.S. government made a sound judgment by denying political asylum to Haitians fleeing their country . <p> Haiti has and will always be a country besieged by political and economic corruption . However , this is not a blanket requirement whereby America opens its arms to more immigrants . <p> The letter writer 's attempt to bring African-Americans into the fight is purely racist . After receiving their assistance , the letter writer as others would simply turn his back and fight only for Haitian movements . <p> The last three presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians who do n't ask us to sacrifice . <p> In 1980 , President Reagan promised lower taxes , higher defense spending and a balanced budget . He won in a landslide . <p> In 1988 during the Republican presidential primaries , Sen. Robert Dole ( R-Kan. ) would n't rule out a tax increase to reduce the deficit . President Bush said , " Read my lips , no new taxes " and became our next president . <p> In this year 's Democratic presidential primaries , Paul Tsongas favored a gas tax and taxes on Social Security benefits for incomes over $125,000 per year . Bill Clinton hammered Tsongas on these positions in campaign ads and won the party 's nomination . <p> Recently , Congress tried to pass a balanced budget amendment , but it fell 10 votes short . <p> Reagan , Bush , Clinton and balanced-budget amendment opponents share a common theme : pain avoidance . Whether throught tax increases , spending cuts or a combination of both , sacrifices must be made to balance the budget . <p> In the wake of the Rodney King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial tension in the United States , I am appalled over the media 's all-time low of giving credence and coverage to the verbal escapades of Sister Souljah and presidential hopeful Bill Clinton . <p> If Sister Souljah 's remarks advocated the killing of white people , regardless of the context in which they were made , they were wrong . The results of such remarks could be devastating . <p> Perhaps we would do better to address the issues of homelessness , hunger , domestic violence , how to develop family relationships and the like . <p> We could even give greater coverage to people who make and have made significant contributions to this society . <p> Perhaps we could air more proposed solutions to the many problems we face . I hardly think these issues would get the same attention as Sister Souljah and Ice-T . <p> The Georgia National Organization for Women must be thrilled with its new president , Clara Bostic , who was quoted in The Constitution as saying she thinks " it 's more cruel to give a baby up for adoption than to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wonder where is my child ? " ' <p> Should I apologize to my 3-year-old adopted son for the cruelty his birth-mother showed in allowing him to be born ? <p> Should his adoptive father and I apologize for the cruelty we have shown him by bringing him into our home and loving him with all of our hearts ? <p> I agree with Ms. Bostic that a quick marriage is not usually the best solution to a teen pregnancy . <p> And contrary to the Murphy Brown scenario , bringing a baby into a single-mother home is not ideal , either . But to say that adoption is more cruel than abortion ? Please !
