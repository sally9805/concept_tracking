The crash of Avianca Flight 52 on Long Island 's North Shore , which killed 72 of the 161 people aboard , was the first major air disaster in the U.S. since the United Airlines DC-10 crash in Iowa last July that killed 111 . But for Colombia 's national airline , it was the third serious mishap in eleven months . Counting last November 's terrorist bombing of a Boeing 727 , the disasters have taken 279 lives . <P> Bogota 's El Tiempo reported that poor maintenance had caused two near crashes in the past two months , prompting indignant pilots to send a letter of protest to Avianca management . The pilots cited 37 failures of flight-control equipment on one plane alone between last October and December , said the paper . <P> In the Long Island catastrophe , Flight 52 , bound from Bogota via Medellin to New York City , smashed into a wooded hillside in the wealthy community of Cove Neck . The absence of fire or explosion on impact and the lack of fumes afterward led to speculation that the 23-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was supposed to land at New York 's Kennedy Airport . <P> The disaster 's most poignant aspect was the number of children on board  --  estimates ranged from seven to 15  --  who were being flown to the U.S. for adoption . Because Colombian courts recess from Dec. 15 until Jan. 15 , there was a backlog of Americans in Bogota who had received permission to bring their adopted children home . The approvals came just in time for some to catch Flight 52 . At least two of the children are known to have survived , but the fate of the rest remained unclear at week 's end .
