No compromise . Who says a great PC has to cost $2000 ? Fast , full-featured systems based on Intel 's new Celeron-366 and AMD 's K6-2-400 could make you forget the Pentium II . 4 By Laurianne McLaughlin Photograph CyberMax Enthusiast Kill 400 Photograph HP Vectra VE Series 8 // IF YOU CONSIDER $999 desktop PCs too light on features and $2000 PCs too heavy on price , you 'll like the new alternatives . Machines based on economical chips from Intel and AMD provide an excellent balance of speed and features , at a price that 's right on the mark-about $1499 including a monitor . FAST AND CHEAP THE BEST CELERON-366 and K6-2-400 systems we tested for this review zipped through business productivity programs , in some cases running applications like Word and Excel faster than a Pentium II350 system . Do you work ( or play ) with demanding graphics applications and games from time to time ? No problem . Several of the new systems are strong graphics performers . ( Note that graphics performance depends heavily on a system 's graphics chip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're feature rich . All five systems we tested came with 64MB of RAM , and only one had a hard drive smaller than 10GB . The most impressively loaded , CyberMax 's Enthusiast KII 400 , includes a DVDROM drive , a graphics card with 16MB of SDRAM , and a 19-inch monitor-all for an eye-popping $1499 ( see " CyberMax 's Feature-Packed Enthusiast : Best of a Good Lot " ) . BUDGET GETS BRAWNY HOW DID BUDGET PCs turn into such racehorses ? For one thing , Intel 's rivals , especially AMD , are keeping the CPU business as competitive as ever . Meanwhile , Intel has been trying to build a strong reputation for its budget-oriented Celeron chips . Moreover , Intel has learned that making Celeron chips too much slower than Pentium Ils is risky business : Reviewers panned the first Celeron , the cacheless 266 , because it performed poorly . The Celeron-333 , which tacked 128KB of secondary cache onto the chip , ran much faster . Now , Intel is trying to further improve Celeron 's image by rapidly cranking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read this , some vendors will be shipping computers based on the 400-MHz Celeron , a product Intel had originally planned to ship much later in the year . ( The chip was not avail- able for testing at press time . ) As a result of these changes , the once-lowly Celeron now packs enough punch to please even a power user . CELERON VS . PII FIRST CONSIDER the Celeron 's performance . Two of the three shipping Celeron-366 machines we tested , the Hewlett-Packard Vectra VE Series 8 and the Micron Millennia C366 , recorded PC WorldBench 98 scores of 188 and 186 , respectively , on business apps ( see the test report below ) . In comparison , the Pentium II-35o machines with 64MB of RAM that we 've tested earned scores between 178 and 188-almost identical to , if not a bit slower than , the numbers posted by Celeron366 computers . And the average PII-400 machine snagged a score of 198 , only about 5 percent faster than the HP Celeron-366 machine . It 's unlikely you 'll notice that small a difference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 64MB of RAM we 've tested scored 203 , an unexciting 8 percent faster than the HP system . Now compare the prices : While the new budget PCs we reviewed range from $1399 to $1568 , you 'd have to pay at least $1599 for many Pentium II-350-based PCs and at least $1699 for many PII-4oo systems . ( Some high-end PII-35os and PII-400s sell for closer to $2000 . ) You 'd pay at least $2200 for most PII450 systems , but such machines are significantly faster ( an average of about 13 percent ) than the best Celerons . For some people , a Pentium II-based computer offers advantages that go beyond clock speed . PlI350 , - 400 , and - 45o PCs incorporate a 100-MHz system bus , whereas the Celeron-366 and - 400 system bus runs at 66 MHz . The faster bus speeds up some tasks , particularly those that involve large graphics or database files that do n't fit inside the secondary cache . So for work like intensive desktop publishing or database mining , a fast Pentium II-powered system is worth the extra cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Also , systems with a 100MHz bus make it easier to upgrade the CPU later . And users with demanding graphics needs , for whom every second counts , will probably want a PII-450 machine . Outfitted with good graphics cards , PII450 machines run applications like Macromedia Director ( a multimedia authoring tool ) and games like Redline Racer faster than machines powered by a Celeron-366 or K6-2-400 processor can . SMART CONFIGS BUT FOR MANY people , the new Pentium II alternatives from Intel and AMD offer plenty of speed . You 'll see the Celeron-366 in systems designed for corporations , small businesses , and homes . At just $1434 with a 17-inch monitor , the HP Vectra VE Series 8 is a smart midrange corporate system for running Microsoft Office-type applications . Like other Vectra VEs , it has a 3Com 10/100 network card ; HP 's manageability software , which lets IS managers detect hardware problems early ; and theft-prevention features like a lockable case . It 's not suited for image-editing work , but its integrated Matrox MGA G-100 AGP graphics chip with 4MB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only quibble : HP 's 4.3GB hard drive is the smallest of the bunch . For $1449 with a 15-inch monitor , Micron 's Millennia C366 home PC delivers goodies like a V.90 modem and an integrated NVidia RIVA 128 ZX graphics chip ( with 8MB of SGRAM ) on the motherboard . The extra memory helped this machine play 3D games more smoothly than the other two Celerons did , and to run one game , Redline Racer , faster than some PII-400s ( see " Micron and CyberMax Provide Solid Graphics for Under $1500 " ) . But remember , graphics speed often boils down to the graphics chip , not the CPU . Compaq 's Prosignia Desktop Model 310 , part of a new line aimed at small businesses , costs the least of the five systems we reviewed-just $1399 with a 17-inch monitor . Like the Micron , it carries a V.go 56-kilobits-per-second modem . The Prosignia 310 also has a Diamond Viper V33o graphics card armed with 4MB of SGRAM . K6-2-400s : BRING " EM ON NOW ON TO THAT healthy competition from AMD . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold their own against Celeron-366 machines and slow Pentium II-400s . Like previous K6-2 chips , the K6-2400 includes AMD 's 3DNow CPU instructions , designed to speed up applications specially enhanced for 3DNow or DirectX 6. o . Today , less than 20 applications have native support for 3DNow , and most of these are games . // Micron and CyberMax Provide Solid Graphics for Under $1500 // Of the two K6-2-400 systems we tested-the CyberMax Enthusiast KII 40o and the Compaq Presario 5240the CyberMax was the clear winner . This $1499 machine earned a WorldBench 98 score of 187 , almost identical to the scores of the HP and Micron Celeron-366s . The two slowest PII-400 systems with 64MB of RAM we 've tested earned similar scores ( 191 and i85 ) , whereas the fastest PII-40 system earned a score of 203 , or about 9 percent faster than the Enthusiast ( a negligible difference when you 're running a word processor or spreadsheet ) . // CyberMax 's Feature-Packed Enthusiast : Best of a Good Lot // The Enthusiast comes with an STB Velocity 4400 graphics card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory , the most generous here , helped the PC outperform the other four systems on two of four graphics tests : It earned the best score when running a PowerPoint presentation with an AVI file operating in the background , and when running a 3D game called Incoming . Considering that the Enthusiast also comes with a 19-inch monitor and a DVD-ROM drive , its price makes it a steal . To top it off , CyberMax earned good marks in our recent Reliability and Service survey ( see " PC Reliability and Service : Who Can You Trust ? " www.pcworld. com/nov98/service ) . Compaq 's Presario 5240 looks less impressive in comparison-$1568 gets you a i5inch monitor and a graphics card with 8MB of SGRAM . The system was noticeably slower than the CyberMax on business apps , too , earning a WorldBench 98 score of o70 . CENTS AND SENSIBILITY COMPUTERS BASED on the Celeron-366 and K6-2-400 chips are right on the money for many PC buyers . They are solid , reasonably priced work and home PCs that do n't skimp on features . They run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your system 's CPU with such demanding work as database mining , or you live and breathe graphics apps that cry out for every bit of speed available , these $14-range PCs have plenty of power . ( If you must have a high-end Pentium II , it pays to look ahead . See " Your PC in the New Millennium " on page 104 . ) We ca n't make sweeping assumptions about K6-2-400 systems based on the two we tested here . But if there are more like the CyberMax Enthusiast out there , all we can say is , " Bring " em on . " Finally , you 've got a great choice in between $999 lightweights and $2000 wallet busters . <p>
