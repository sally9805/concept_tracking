Part One THE SHERIFF 1938 Selfmade men always do a lopsided job of it , and the sheriff had come out conspicuously short on the capacity to sympathize with anyone but himself . No doubt ears still were burning at the Fort Peck end of the telephone connection ; he 'd had to tell that overgrown sap of an undersheriff he did n't give a good goddamn what the night foreman said about dangerous , get the thing fished out of the river if it meant using every last piece of equipment at the dam site . This was what he was up against all the time , the sheriff commiserated with himself during the drive from Glasgow now , toward dawn . People never behaving one bit better than they could get away with . Die of eyelids , you could on this monotonous stretch of highway down to the dam , he reminded himself , and cranked open the window for night air to help keep him awake . He 'd been up until all hours , sheriffing the town of Glasgow through the boisterous end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone jangled . Catch up on sleep , the stupid saying went , but in five years as sheriff he had yet to see any evidence that the world worked that way , ever made it up to you for postponement of shuteye and all the other  - -  The cat-yellow shapes of bulldozers sprang huge into his headlights , causing him to blink and brake hard as he steered onto the approach to the dam . Past the bulks of earthmoving equipment parked for the night , on the rail spur stood a waiting parade of even more mammoth silhouettes , flatcars loaded high with boulders to be tumbled into place on the dam face . Then , like a dike as told by a massive liar , Fort Peck Damitself . The sheriff hated the sight of the ungodly pyramid of raw dirt that the dambuilders were piling across the throat of the Missouri River . He hated Franklin Delano Roosevelt for this project and its swarm of construction towns , if that 's what you wanted to call such collections of shacks , and the whole shovelhead bunch down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Damn this New Deal crap . Was n't there any better way to run a country than to make jobs out of thin air , handing out wage money like it was cigarette papers ? The sheriff hated having to call himself a Democrat , though he knew that a person could n't even get elected to town idiot these days without that tag . By now he was nearing the floodlights , could see the workbarge with its crane arm poised and the cluster of men at the truck ramp where it must have happened . He crept the patrol car along the crest of the dam and when he parked made it a point not only to leave the car in gear but set the emergency brake , hard as he could yank it . Before heading down to the group at the water 's edge , though , the sheriff stopped and took a long look east across the river , past last month 's trouble here , to the bankside promontories of bluffs and badland ravines emerging in dawn outline like scissored shadows . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of the earth to tend justice on . The upper Missouri River country , or anyway the seventy-five-mile series of bends of the river that Valley County extended north from , like a castle footed into a seacoast . Kinnick 's own climb up through life began beside this river , familyless boy mucking out barns and calcimining chickenhouses , working up to the haying jobs , the alfalfa-seed harvest jobs , up and up , squirreling every loose cent away until he had enough to make his start in Glasgow , the county seat . After that there was no stopping him , of course , but he 'd always felt  --  still did feel  --  somehow that first lift into career , into politics ( or as he preferred to think of it , law enforcement ) had come from the spell of the river . As far as Carl Kinnick was concerned , the Missouri with its broad fast flow and its royal-green cottonwood groves and the deep bottomland that made the best farming in eastern Montana , the Missouri had been next thing to perfect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until this giant federal dike to put people to work with the excuse ( benefit , the Roosevelters were always calling it ) of stopping floods in the states downriver all the way to St. Louis .

He picked his way from boulder to boulder down the riprap face of the dam to the cluster of men waiting for him . He nodded only to the night foreman . The owl-shift workers all had turned to watch him arrive , the bibs of their overalls fencing him in . The sheriff was the shortest by half a head in any group , and how he felt about that can be guessed . Singling out his undersheriff , without preamble he asked what was delaying matters . " We 've about got it up , Carl , honest . The diver had a hell of a time with it in the dark down there . " The sheriff bit back an impulse to tell the big scissorbill that excuses are like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms and rocked back and forth on the small heels of his boots while watching the crane at work . Its cable into the water was being reeled in by the operator on the barge , the steel strand making a steady low hum through the intricate pulleys of the boom arm , until suddenly  --  a lot quicker than the sheriff expected , actually  --  a wallowing sound came and then the splash of water falling away as the surface was broken upward by a Ford truck . I 've seen some lulus since I got myself elected to this badge , Kinnick thought as the vehicle dangled from the cable hooked around its front axle , water pouring from the wide cab and box as if a metal trough had been yanked straight up by one end . But I never had to put up with them wrecking themselves on the bottom of the river before . For a moment he hoped the Ford 's cab would be empty , then canceled that at the prospect of having to drag this river , lake , whatever this stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe , just maybe there had n't even been anybody in the truck when the thing rolled down the ramp and plunged into the water about an hour after midnight . The section watchman swore he had n't heard a motor running , only the splash ; then when he raced over , he 'd seen only what appeared to him in the lack of light to be the cab and boxboards of a truck going under . Maybe this was only a case of a poorly parked rig that coasted loose somehow . But if there was n't some brand of human misbehavior involved in a truck visiting the bottom of the Missouri on a Saturday night at Fort Peck , Sheriff Kinnick was going to be plentifully surprised . The Ford ton-and-a-half twisted slowly in the air like cargo coming ashore . When the crane operator lowered the load as far up the face of the dam as the boom arm would reach , the men clambered to it and the undersheriff , at Kinnick 's impatient nod , wrenched the driver's-side door open .

Both were naked . Without taking his eyes off the dead pair , the sheriff put out an arm and , even though he knew the gesture was useless , waved back the gawking damworkers behind him . This was the moment he always searched for in a case . The instant of discovery . Any witness 's first view of what had happened , right there was where you wanted to start . Now that he himself was essentially the first onto the scene of whatever this was , though , the sheriff was more than a bit uncomfortable at the lack of exactitude here . An entire circus of circumstance , here before his eyes , yet somehow not as substantial as he would have liked . As if the bunch behind him with their necks out like an ostrich farm were sopping u                    @
