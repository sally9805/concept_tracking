SPEEDING ACROSS the skies at up to 28,000 kilometers per hour , artificial satellites are surprisingly visible as they go about their business hundreds , or even thousands , of kilometers above the Earth . The first satellite I ever saw was the derelict Skylab on one of its final passes over Boston in 1979 . As I watched that brilliant " star " cruising low in the south after sunset , I could n't help but wonder : what would it look like through a telescope ? You too may have been tempted to aim your telescope at passing satellites . Perhaps you 've tried to . Calculations show that even a 6-inch telescope can resolve large structures in low Earth orbit . MOVING TARGETS In June 1995 I invited Marek Kozubal , a computer-science student at Brandeis University , to join me in exploring the problems surrounding telescopic satellite observing . In our spare time during the next several months we developed a system that enables us to routinely use a 12-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain and 7-inch refractor to view satellites at up to 460x , even during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that of predicting and following satellite motion . If satellites were stationary in the sky , viewing them would be as simple as staring at a star or planet . In theory you could even pop in a highpower eyepiece and leisurely check out the shuttle 's cockpit or what 's going on in the payload bay . Of course , most satellites move too quickly to keep them centered in an eyepiece 's tiny field of view . Try it manually and you 're in for a bad case of orbital whiplash . Attempts at tracking satellites by hand also introduce considerable telescope vibration , which is fatal to the subarcsecond resolution desired for discerning fine details . Our goal was to have a computerized telescope smoothly follow the satellites . In Boston , at the Museum of Science 's Gilliland Observatory , our telescopes are controlled by the Archimage mount built by Tom Melsheimer of Merlin Controls Corp . With its 2-arcminute pointing accuracy and programmable slew rates , the Archimage mount excels at moving along trajectories that would be impossible to pursue by hand . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method for predicting a target 's location and speed , and software to guide the mount along the computed path . We could not find suitable existing software , so Kozubal and I decided to create it ourselves . We started by browsing the abundance of information on the Internet . A particularly good site was the Air Force Institute of Technology ( ftp : /ll **30;87;TOOLONG ) , where we acquired fact sheets about so-called SG and SD orbital-perturbation models . Perturbation theory produces accurate trajectory predictions by modifying Kepler 's fundamental equations with terms for atmospheric drag , lunar and solar influences , and gravitational harmonics due to an inhomogeneous Earth . SG models are for low-altitude orbits ( with periods less than 225 minutes ) , SD models are for high-altitude orbits . We found other helpful resources in Jean Meeus 's Astronomical Algorithms and several articles in Sky &; Telescope . The programming itself was tough going . After a full day at the planetarium , we would spend hours discussing algorithms , writing code , and testing the software , often until sunrise . After months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a workable solution . We completed our preliminary version of the software , C-Sat , just in time for the Space Shuttle 's July 1995 docking with Mir . ( We finished coding only an hour before they passed over Boston ! ) Since then , we have added many features that significantly enhance the program 's accuracy and ease of use . Photograph Astronomical Computing // To operate , the software needs accurate time and location . The computer 's clock can be set manually , or via modem with C-Sat 's atomic-clock synchronization routine ( which operates much like those discussed in the February issue , page 81 ) . Your location can be determined from topographic maps , or for space-age precision , you can use a Global Positioning System ( GPS ) receiver . After inputting these data , the computer automatically scans the space above the telescope and displays an ever-changing menu of all the satellites visible from your location at that moment ( see the illustration on the next page ) . Selecting a target from the list causes the telescope to move to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At zero , the satellite crosses through the field of view and the mount 's servo motors match the target 's angular speed , resulting in the spacecraft remaining centered in the eyepiece . To illustrate the software 's pointing accuracy , we often have the telescopes lock on to targets that are completely invisible , hidden in Earth 's shadow . As the satellite emerges into sunlight , it brightens smack in the middle of the eyepiece - an orbital " sunrise . " We have also successfully observed 3rd-magnitude satellites during the daytime . Although we can track hundreds of satellites each night , most of them , even at 460x , appear only as pinpoints . Basic trigonometry illustrates why : a 2-meterwide satellite 400 km away subtends only 1 arcsecond . While most objects in orbit will remain starlike , there are some notable exceptions . For example , the 37meter-long Space Shuttle can subtend some 40 arcseconds when passing overhead in a 200-km orbit . That 's roughly the angular size of Jupiter . Another favorite of ours is the space station Mir . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 33 meters long . Its high-inclination orbit often yields very favorable flyovers in the midnorthern latitudes . Despite its altitude of 400 km and 17-arcsecond maximum apparent size , it is a fascinating object to observe . Our 7- and 12-inch scopes easily resolve Mir 's solar panels , modules , booms , and antennas . The occasional resupply ships and Space Shuttle dockings are always exciting to watch as well . Another shuttle/Mir rendezvous is scheduled for August , so we 'll be watching once again . Among the other interesting targets are the hundreds of burned-out rocket stages . Many of them look like little pencils , sometimes tumbling end over end . And of course there are more than a few top-secret spy satellites up there . Some - telescopes , perhaps  --  appear cylindrical , about 15 to 20 meters long , with solar panels . ( In the interest of avoiding a massive tax audit , that 's all I 'll say on the topic ! ) GETTING GOOD IMAGES Viewing satellites with the eye is one thing , but Kozubal and I also wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the telescope would surely amaze others as much as us . Our challenge was to take sub-arcsecondresolution images of objects only a few arcseconds across and traveling at high speed . This was to be done in a few optimal seconds during each pass through sea-level atmospheric turbulence . To record big and bright satellites such as the Space Shuttle and Mir we use a GBC 505E black-and-white video camera on the observatory 's Meade 12-inch f/10 Schmidt-Cassegrain . The camera 's 512by-768 array of 9-micron pixels offers excellent resolution . When the telescope locks on to a passing satellite , the target is centered on the tiny CCD with help from a flip-up mirror assembly and reticle and by making fine adjustments with a joystick . The NTSC video output is recorded on a professional-grade Sony Beta-format deck for later examination . Photograph Photograph // Atmospheric turbulence obscures most detail even in the best conditions Since a laser adaptive-optics system was way out of our price range , we adopted a poor man 's solution for " untwinkling " the spacecraft images : videotape . By recording 30 high-resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepping through in slow motion . Out of the thousands of images on the tape , a few flawless frames show spectacular detail , with almost no atmospheric distortion at all . Digitizing the best video frames and combining them increases the signal-to-noise ratio of the resulting image , which is then suitable for processing . AMAZING SIGHTS AND THE FUTURE Satellites transiting the lunar disk are quite common , but one of the more unusual events we observed was the solar " double transit " of the Space Shuttle Columbia on October 22,1995 . On this date the shuttle was due to transit the Sun on two consecutive orbits as seen from a single location in Attleboro , Massachusetts . Using a GPS receiver , we drove to the precise location and set up two Meade 8-inch LX200s to observe the event in white and hydrogen-alpha light . At the duly appointed time , the shuttle 's shadow raced over us at more than 25,000 kilometers per hour . Columbia became visible in both telescopes as a black dot zipping across the solar disk . Ninety minutes later we watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing color of orbital sunset playing across Mir as the space station slips into Earth 's shadow . Upon entering the penumbra , Mir shifts from brilliant white to gold , to a lovely iridescent orange in just a few seconds . Once inside the umbra , the structure remains visible by refracted sunlight for several more seconds before fading to the deepest red imaginable and disappearing completely . In addition to our ongoing studies of Mir , we look forward to our first attempt to perform three-dimensional satellite imaging during August 's shuttle/Mir docking mission . Another project involves a detailed exploration of the geostationary satellite belt 36,000 km above the Earth 's equator . And , we have mused that perhaps someday we 'll use an integrating CCD to detect the Space Shuttle 's cabin or payload-bay lights when the spacecraft is otherwise hidden in Earth 's shadow .
