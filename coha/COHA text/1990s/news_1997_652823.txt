<p> IT 'S AN EARLY JANUARY EVENING IN 1967 , and with the dinner dishes cleared the nuclear family settles in around the Magnavox black-and-white . Samantha seethes at Endora for turning Darrin into a donkey on the night before an important presentation . Sister Bertrille , the Flying Nun , has got herself in trouble again , trying to raise money for the orphanage . The Riddler is leading Batman and Robin on a wild-goose chase  --  wham !  --  through the sewers of Gotham City . <p> Flash forward 30 years , to an early January evening in 1997 . The Domino 's pizza boxes are in the trash , and what 's left of the nuclear family clicks on the 27-inch Sony and hunkers down for some prime-time tube . On " The Nanny , " Fran , in a skintight mini , teases her handsome boss with not-so-veiled allusions to her sex life . On " Men Behaving Badly , " Jamie runs out of coffee filters and uses his underwear to make coffee for a woman he is trying to pick up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumps out of a cake half-nude , Chippendale's-style . A promo for " Spin City " promises that Michael J. Fox 's character will be impotent with his live-in girlfriend . <p> By all measures , the television sitcom has changed radically in 30 years . Some people moan over the demise of the Golden Era , saying there 's too little original humor . Others counter that series like " Seinfeld " and " The Larry Sanders Show " ( and " Cheers " a few years back ) represent a hybrid form that meshes intelligent comedy with keen social observation . But there 's one thing that virtually anyone who watches television comedies these days will agree on : sex is everywhere . <p> A study released in December by Children Now and the Kaiser Family Foundation , two public-policy groups , found that three out of every four shows in the " family hour "  --  8 P.M. to 9 P.M.  --  now contain " sexually related talk or behavior , " a fourfold increase since 1976 . The study has given new ammunition to family-values advocates across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuade the television industry to adopt a ratings system that would specifically flag sexual material rather than simply characterizing shows according to age appropriateness . <p> But for many people within the industry  --  and no doubt many viewers  --  there is a more important issue at stake than the moral one . " The biggest problem with how much sex there is on TV now is n't whether it 's offensive , " says Norman Lear , one of the people who broke television 's sexual taboos in the 1970 's to raise social consciousness . " It 's that most of the sex on TV today just is n't funny . It 's stupid and boring . " <p> As network executives point out heatedly , most of television 's sex play does n't proceed to sexual intercourse . Generally it involves a lot of " physical flirting , " some stroking and a steamy kiss or two . In fact , the Kaiser-Children Now study concedes that out of 451 depictions of " sexual behavior " in the family hour , only 15 involved sexual intercourse . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about sex . The study reported that in each 8 to 9 P.M. viewing hour examined , there were an average of 3.1 instances of " comments about others ' sexual activity " and " comments about own sexual activity . " After 9 , the average goes up significantly . From the so-called quality sitcoms , like " Mad About You " and " Third Rock From the Sun , " to more downscale versions of the genre , like " Martin " and " Married . . . With Children , " a majority of story lines in prime time revolve around the characters ' sexual gratification  --  or lack of it . <p> Parents , politicians and religious leaders will continue to argue about whether all this sex affects the nation 's moral fiber . But what about the nation 's need for laughs ? In the last several decades , television 's depiction of life has taken a 180-degree turn toward the prurient , but virtually no one  --  including the writers and producers responsible for today 's shows  --  says that all this sex makes sitcoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could ever argue that , " says Larry Charles , a former " Seinfeld " writer who is executive producer of " Mad About You . " " There are reasons to write about sex and there are times when it 's very funny , but most of the time it 's cheap , easy and moronic . " <p> Like many sitcom writers , Mr. Charles makes a distinction between good sex and bad on television . The sex on NBC 's " Seinfeld , " for example , is handled with great sophistication , he says . Even the famous episode in which the four main characters compete to see who can refrain longest from masturbating  --  Mr. Charles did n't write it  --  was executed with remarkable subtlety . " Most important , " he says , " it was very , very funny . " <p> NBC 's " Frasier , " says Mr. Lear , is another example of a show that deals with sex in a grown-up yet lighthearted manner . The unrequited physical desire of Niles , Frasier 's repressed brother , for Daphne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd . " And it adds another dimension to the show , " Mr. Lear says . " Because it 's all about sexual confusion and class distinctions . " <p> On " Mad About You , " Paul and Jamie , who are married and , for a little while longer , childless , seem to have plenty of sex and seem to spend plenty of time arguing about the amount of sex they 're having . Last season they almost broke up because Jamie was almost having an affair . " ' Seinfeld ' is about the hopelessness of intimacy , " Mr. Charles says , " whereas ' Mad About You ' is about the hopefulness of it . We try to create a relationship that includes sex , just like relationships do in real life . It 's not done to titillate ; it 's done to make our characters multidimensional . " <p> Not so on shows like Fox 's " Married . . . With Children , " which began as a cleverly bawdy parody of the saccharine family sitcoms of the 1950 's but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-the-top parody of itself . " We do n't have any sort of deep philosophical reason for joking about sex , " says Ron Leavitt , the creator of the show . " Our intention was just to subvert the genre of squeaky-clean family entertainment . " <p> After 10 seasons  --  it 's the longest-running sitcom on the air  --  even the characters ' outrageousness has become predictable . The few jokes that do n't refer to the sexual habits of the characters ( a sexually frustrated mother , a prematurely ejaculating father , a slutty daughter , a sleazy son ) revolve around their bad personal hygiene . " It 's pretty much lowest common denominator with an edge , " Mr. Leavitt admits . <p> ( In at least one case , life has been said to imitate so-called art . Tisha Campbell , a star of Fox 's " Martin , " several weeks ago sued her co-star , Martin Lawrence , accusing him of " repeated and escalating " sexual harassment . Ms. Campbell contends that Mr. Lawrence groped her body and simulated intercourse in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denies the accusations . ) <p> The highly sexualized approach of the tamer , more mainstream shows is harder to categorize . On a recent episode of " Friends , " which occupies the controversial 8 P.M. spot in NBC 's highly rated Thursday lineup , Chandler 's plan to make money by donating sperm affects his performance in bed , forcing him to master the skills of oral sex . The central premise of " Third Rock From the Sun , " also on NBC , is that aliens learn to be human by learning about sex . And on a recent episode of NBC 's " Men Behaving Badly , " a man who has been nursing his sick girlfriend asks eagerly if he can give her another sponge bath . " I do n't think so , " she answers . " My breasts are clean enough to eat off of . " <p> Michael Weithorn , who created Fox 's " Ned and Stacey , " says it is business realities that force writers these days to mine the mother lode of sexual humor . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 18 and 49 , and sometimes 18 and 34 , " he says . " The style of humor is aimed at them . That 's what it takes sometimes to make them laugh . " Although he tries to put " Ned and Stacey " " a step above that , " he concedes that " sex is an easy place to go for a cheap laugh . " <p> Eric Tannenbaum , the president of Columbia Tri-Star , the studio that developed " Mad About You " for NBC and " The Nanny " for CBS , says that there simply are n't enough talented writers to insure that sex will be handled with aplomb . " With all the new outlets  --  the WB , UPN and cable  --  there are too many shows and not enough originality , " he says . <p> CONCERN ABOUT EXPENSE also plays a role . Most sitcoms are shot with three cameras , to give the shows their stage-play feel . But three-camera comedy is expensive ; it 's difficult to shoot on location and in the studio . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and presumably focus on topics other than sex  --  are often impractical . <p> A live audience , now de rigueur for most sitcoms , also limits plot possibilities , writers say . When actors have to wait for laughter to subside , the pacing changes , and all too often the actors play to the gallery . Writers say that because of this , they often choose plots that will evoke properly timed titters . " The network keeps telling you , ' Make it funnier , more laughs , more laughs , ' " says Amy Sherman , who spent four years writing for " Roseanne . " <p> When Jay Tarses , who created " The Bob Newhart Show " in the early 1970 's , began work on " Buffalo Bill " in 1983 , he insisted that there be no audience . That show , which treated sex with a hilarious sourness that has not been seen on television since , needed the closed set to " liberate " the actors . " We could n't do that today , " he says , referring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dabney Coleman , played out an imaginary World Series game in his living room to decide whether to pay for his girlfriend 's abortion or to simply turn his back on the woman . " We would never be able to create that level of anarchy . " <p> As clinical as Mr. Tarses ' explanation seems , treating sex as any sort of technical issue or plot device was inconceivable before the 1970 's . Before then , sex simply did not exist on the small screen , save for veiled fantasies like " My Living Doll " and " I Dream of Jeannie . " <p> In the 1950 's , the Kramdens ' bedroom was virtually off limits to the camera , and Donna Reed radiated no more than wholesomeness to her husband . Lucy and Ricky Ricardo slept in separate beds  --  as did Rob and Laura Petrie and every other married couple in a sitcom in the 50 's and 60 's . There was even public outcry over Mary Tyler Moore 's shapely appearance in capri pants . The raciest it got was when Morticia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips up her shrouded arm . <p> Back then , says Mr. Tarses , writers had to get creative with characterizations because there were so many things they could n't say . " You could n't even get away with a subtle double-entendre , " he says . <p> The sea change came in about 1970 , largely prompted by two men : Mr. Lear and James L. Brooks . True products of their era 's new cultural explicitness , they were the first to champion sitcoms as realistic , albeit deeply ironic , reflections of the human condition . In 1971 , Mr. Lear created " All in the Family , " which , in addition to attacking bigotry , limned topics like abortion , breast cancer and sexual fantasy . Although Mary Richards , the heroine Mr. Brooks created for " The Mary Tyler Moore Show , " was never shown puffing on a post-coital cigarette , it was understood that she sometimes had sex with the men she dated . <p> It was n't laughs Mr. Lear was after when he broke those taboos , he says ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with the problems of human sexuality and with the societal condemnation that surrounded those problems , " he says . " We did n't have much forethought about it ; we just thought it should be done . " <p> MR . LEAR ALSO BROKE another , more subtle television taboo : he refused to adhere to the tradition of providing a punch line every two minutes . " There were times , " he recalls , " that Edith and Archie talked for four or five solid minutes without a big joke . They said amusing things that went to the heart of their characters , but we did n't feel like we needed a big payoff all the time . " <p> For Larry Charles , who was a teen-ager at the time , it was a " breathtaking time , an inspiration . " " For the first time in situation comedy , " he says , " the characters could have a normal conversation . " <p> But Mr. Lear acknowledges that he was only allowed to test the limits because his show was a hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honesty , and there was a lot of support , " he says . " When you have good ratings , the networks suddenly think all that crazy stuff you wanted to do is all right . " <p> With the taboos broken , the sexual content of television reached a new high  --  or low  --  in the mid-1970 's . Amid the disillusion surrounding Watergate and the dissoluteness of the disco era , Fred Silverman , then the programming guru at ABC , ushered in such " jigglefests " as " Three 's Company . " That phenomenally successful show , which ran from 1977 to 1984 , was essentially a reworking of classic bedroom farce ; virtually every joke sprang from the theoretically comedic situation of two women sharing an apartment with a lusty male roommate who had convinced the landlord that he was gay . <p> Although the show was weakly written and the characters barely two-dimensional by any standard , " Three 's Company " showcased the slapstick talents of the young John Ritter . And it tapped what might be a perpetual audience hunger for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mr. Tarses says , " in some form since Feydeau  --  which does n't mean it was n't dumb . " <p> In the 1980 's , in the atmosphere of wholesomeness typified by " The Cosby Show " and that of nostalgia cultivated by Garry Marshall , the creator of " Happy Days " and " Laverne and Shirley , " sitcoms grew tame again . Many people in the television business agree that " Cheers " and " Roseanne " were among the only shows of that era that explored sexual themes in a manner that was both acute and fresh . " Cheers was able to go deep within the heart of a womanizer and make him funny , sad and sympathetic , " says Ms. Sherman , the former " Roseanne " writer , " and we introduced the world to a couple that was big and fat and still wanted to have sex all the time . " <p> By the early 1990 's , sex had seeped back into sitcoms in a big , and often broad , way . Many shows trotted out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the smaller networks  --  Fox , WB and UPN  --  began to franchise leering sexual innuendo , especially after 9 P.M. With their biggest stations in large urban markets , the nascent networks began developing comedies they believed would appeal to young people living in the cities . So far that strategy has proved marginally successful ; WB and UPN are gaining viewers , and Fox has created genuine hits like " The Simpsons . " <p> What does the future hold ? Will most sitcoms continue to recycle tired sexual themes of the wink-and-nudge variety ? Probably , writers seem to concede . " I do n't think audiences know how to be audiences anymore , " says Mr. Lear . " They just want to hoot and make sounds . " <p> But Mr. Charles says that some of the writers of his generation do see themselves as heirs to Mr. Lear and Mr. Brooks , and to Les and Glen Charles of " Cheers . " The question of whether television sex is funny is ultimately a question of the quality of writing , he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A show that does clunky and gratuitous sexual humor is not likely to be well written in any way , " he points out . <p> For Mr. Charles , the challenge is to resist the " urge to recycle " to fill the industry 's insatiable hunger for product . " We need to step up to the next level , " he says , " to include more dramatic elements and explore sexuality in greater depth . The sitcom has to break the boundaries again . Otherwise it will eat its young . "
