<p> Doug Drabek and Greg Swindell came home three years ago , hoping the best years of their careers would be spent playing for the team they grew up watching . <p> They were the two pitchers who were going to be the cornerstones for the team new Astros owner Drayton McLane was hoping to build . And McLane was willing to pay an enormous sum to get them . <p> Drabek signed a four-year deal worth almost $ 20 million , while Swindell came to the Astros via a four-year contract worth close to $ 18 million . But despite the $ 38 million investment , the two have combined for a 61-64 record in three Houston seasons with a 4.05 earned-run average . <p> Now , the two veteran pitchers enter the final year of their contracts on a team that has a chance to make the playoffs for the first time in 10 years . And the achievement of that goal will depend heavily on how well Drabek and Swindell perform . <p> Since the two pitchers signed with the Astros before the start of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ERA , and Swindell is 30-31 with a 4.32 ERA . <p> " " We know we have a good team , " Swindell said . " " But the big question mark is our pitching , and a big part of that is whether Doug and I can turn it up a notch . No doubt about it , this is a big year for me and Doug . Our futures are going to be determined by it . " <p> Both pitchers had 10-9 records in 1995 . But Swindell 's ERA of 4.47 was his highest since 1987 , and Drabek 's 4.77 was his highest in a 10-year career in the majors . <p> " " I 've just got to get back on track and be more consistent than I have been , " Drabek said . " " My curveball and my sinker have been lacking at times over the last three years . I want to pitch the way I did at Pittsburgh , where I know I can rely on those pitches every night . " <p> Drabek 's record as an Astro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season in Houston , but he had a respectable 3.79 ERA . The Astros scored only 30 runs in his 18 losses . <p> " " Not a lot of people will know that , " Drabek said . " " You see what you see on paper and do n't think about how it happened . " <p> Drabek has been a notorious slow starter , and last year was no exception ; he was much better in the final two months of the season than he was in the first four . In his last 10 starts , Drabek allowed more than three earned runs only twice . He was 3-1 in his last six starts . <p> " " I do n't know if I get stronger or what it is , " Drabek said . <p> " " One thing is I seem to find a groove late in the season and I 'm able to stay in it . It may have something to do with getting the timing down on my breaking ball . " <p> Drabek would n't blame last season 's slow start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strike . <p> " " No , I ca n't say that , " he said . " " The year the owners locked us out ( in 1990 when he won the Cy Young Award ) , we only got three weeks of spring training , but I was 22-6 . " Swindell 's situation last season was the opposite of Drabek 's - Swindell was 8-5 before suffering four consecutive losses . He had a 4.44 ERA in 26 starts before being taken out of the rotation after a 6-2 loss at Florida on Aug. 26 . <p> Management toyed with the idea of making Swindell a full-time reliever , but new general manager Gerry Hunsicker has said Swindell will enter spring training as part of the starting rotation . <p> " " I 'm happy to go into spring training back in the rotation , but I realize that can change at any moment , " Swindell said . <p> " " In this game , anything can change . <p> " " But I 'm willing to do whatever it takes to win . If that means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the outfield if they asked me to as long as it helped us win . " <p> Both Swindell and Drabek realize they will have to pitch well in 1996 to have any hope of playing for the Astros beyond this season . <p> Drabek grew up in Victoria and attended the University of Houston . Last year , he moved into a luxurious new home in The Woodlands with his wife Kristy and their three children . He will turn 34 in July and admits he spent a lot of time contemplating his future over the last few months . <p> " " This offseason is the most I 've ever thought about it , " Drabek said . " " I kept looking down at my kids . In five years my sons will be 14 and 13 . That 's right before they start high school . <p> " " I missed so much of the things they do already , I do n't want to miss those years , whether they are playing sports or not . I guess I 'm using that as my time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to stay in Houston . I want things to work out so I can finish my career here . I guess that would be my plan . " <p> Swindell , who turned 31 last month , does n't have an elaborate plan . <p> " " I just want to keep playing until somebody kicks me off , " he said . " " I have a lot of pride , so I never want to just quit until someone tells me I 'm done . I would like to play at least five more years unless I feel like I ca n't compete at this level anymore . " Like Drabek , Swindell wants to stay in Houston . He grew up here and played baseball at Sharpstown High before becoming an All-American at the University of Texas . <p> And Swindell recently became the first Astros player to make a commitment to help keep the team in Houston by purchasing $ 15,000 worth of tickets to give to underprivileged youngsters this season . Swindell said he wanted to show what the Astros mean to him and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also said he wo n't place added pressure on himself this season . <p> " " I 've never been one to put too much pressure on myself , " Swindell said . " " I want to go out and enjoy myself . But I know if I do n't do well , I wo n't be here . And even if I do well , that does n't mean I will be able to stay . " <p> The club has a contract option on both pitchers for 1997 , but the prevailing logic is that McLane will want to rid himself of more than $ 9 million in salary that Drabek and Swindell cost him per season , no matter how well they pitch this year . <p> The team believes it has two rising stars on the mound in starters Mike Hampton and Shane Reynolds , and Billy Wagner is waiting in the wings to show his blazing fastball to big-league hitters . <p> Drabek and Swindell do n't appear to be part of the long-range picture for the team . <p> " " I understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " " Basically , I try not to think about it because you never know how things will turn out . If it works out , great . I 'm going to try my best to make it happen . That 's what I 'm hoping for . " <p> Swindell is hoping this season brings two things that have n't happened in the three years he has been here - a division title for the Astros and a consistently solid performance for himself . <p> " " Just not reaching the playoffs has been the biggest disappointment , " Swindell said . " " But my earned-run average also has been disappointing . You ca n't really control your won-loss record , but if I had kept my ERA in the threes , the wins and losses would have been different . <p> " " I try not to look back . If you sit around saying , ' What if this , ' or ' What if that , ' it can only hurt you . When my career is over , then I 'll look back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither Drabek nor Swindell shows his emotions openly on the field . Swindell realizes some fans have viewed his lack of emotion as not caring . <p> " " People who perceive me that way do n't know how I am , " Swindell said . " " I do n't even like to lose to my kids in Chutes and Ladders . I give all I 've got out there . <p> " " If I 'm laughing when someone hits a home run off me , it 's because I 'm laughing at myself . It may be weird , but it 's my way of letting out my frustration . " Drabek and Swindell have had more than their share of frustrating days since coming to the Astros . Whether they stay beyond this season or not , both men want to see the frustrations end with a playoff season and a chance at the World Series . <p> " " We really had a good thing going before the strike began in 1994 , " Drabek said . " " Then we got rid of a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year and we made a run at it . <p> " " This seems to be the best team we 've had , maybe as good or better than ' 94 . Even our younger guys have a couple of years under their belts now . " Swindell does n't want to go through what the team experienced last year when it fell one game short of a playoff spot . <p> " " The ' 94 strike was bad for us , " Swindell said . " " But nothing was as bad as having to sit in that locker room on the last day last season and watch another team win ( Colorado ) to take away our playoff spot . <p> " " I 'm not sure if this will be the best team we 've had since I 've been here , but I know we will be good enough to make the playoffs . The experience of the last two years will help us . <p> Everything appears to be set . Now it 's up to us .
