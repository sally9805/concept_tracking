<p> TOTALITARIAN REGIMES , having a lot to fear from photographers , control what can be seen and shown . Democratic regimes , having a lot to fear from photographers , control what they can , stage-managing public life as a set of photo ops . <p> So what happens to photographers when they suddenly slip out of the net of totalitarianism into the wide sea of democracy ? Sometimes they discover that freedom has its own limitations , and sometimes they encounter currents of history that are tricky for anyone to navigate . In 1989 , the fall of the Berlin wall abruptly opened Western markets to East German photojournalists who could find a way into them . The East Germans already had talent to spare ; what they needed , overnight , were new coping skills . Some photographers who had been secure enough in a narrow life were undone by an excess of opportunity . <p> One group that has succeeded in the brave new world is an agency called Ostkreuz , formed by seven East German photographers after reunification . The radical changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once to overwhelm them , but they managed to thrive in the jungle of Western commerce largely because they were smart , they were good , and they had a telephone . <p> Other photographers in the East found themselves incommunicado without the perks of modern technology . The outdated East German phone system had a limited number of telephones and lines to the West . When the wall fell , the East was suddenly hot news , but no one could get through . Ostkreuz invested in a radiophone ; it rang like a cash register . Then they bought file cabinets for a couple of dollars apiece from the Stasi , the former secret police , and went into business . <p> But Communist states had not trained their citizens to operate in an open market , to compete , to understand credit . Suddenly photographers could have better equipment , decent film ( East German color film was so untrue to life that West Germans coveted it for its artistic effects ) , cars , bigger apartments and ruinous debt . Instantly they needed more assignments . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all managed to earn a living , which was a miracle then and still is . Sibylle Bergemann and Ute Mahler take portraits , photo essays and fashion pictures . Werner Mahler specializes in semi-abstract , color landscapes , Jens Rotzsch in color images of travel , Thomas Sandberg in serious , rather old-fashioned black-and-white photo essays , Harf Zimmermann in large-format photographs of architecture . Harald Hauswald ( travel and slightly eccentric reportage ) earned an enormous Stasi file by being published in America , entirely without his knowledge , in High Times magazine and continuing to work for Western publications . Sometimes he used a pseudonym because the state helped itself to a share of foreign earnings . The agency 's signature , if it has one , is its diversity and individuality . Recently it added four younger photographers to keep itself up-to-date . <p> Twenty-five years ago in America , freelance photojournalism , never an easy way to make a living , became exponentially more difficult when the general-interest picture magazines died or doddered . Europe is now facing a similar predicament . Things were better in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory . Mr. Sandberg and Mr. Zimmermann , who speak fluent English , betray both wonder and sorrow over the differences life style and politics make on the practice of photography . <p> In East Germany , a photographer was paid a fixed , limited price for a picture , however long it took to get it , and then only if it was published . No day rate or guarantee , which are standard in the West . " They saved money no matter what it cost , " as Mr. Zimmermann puts it . Still , living was cheap , and no one starved . <p> Artists in fact were cosseted in a peculiar version of paradise , or anyway guaranteed employment . A Government-sponsored organization would arrange murals for factories or documentary films about work . Many bad artists lived quite well . Mr. Sandberg thinks this was insidiously damaging for artists , who need a market in order to find out whether they might be better butchers than painters . ( There were no commercial galleries ; the only official gallery spent most of its energy illegally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamps that were in demand in the antique-crazy West . ) <p> The official organization for photographers did not dole out jobs but set fees and made it impossible for anyone who was not a member to collect them . Photography shows were surprisingly frequent , especially in the official " culture houses " set up by the state . According to Mr. Sandberg , the Government saw these shows as a kind of safety valve , where pictures that could not be printed in large-circulation magazines could be displayed to smaller audiences , because who cared ? <p> The people who came did . The exhibitions were not about censored material but about aspects of everyday life that were not in the official news , so they became a kind of replacement for photojournalism . Unable to find a lot of reality in the newspapers , people were hungry for information . Frequent photography shows continue in East Berlin but no longer mean so much . Everything can be printed in the papers now . <p> Back then , the party decided what could be printed . Every day the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central Committee saying : " Why did that story look ugly ? Our working class is beautiful . They have the power in this country . They deserve to be treated well . " Someone would lose a promotion , and the editor would be even more careful next time . <p> Photographers knew what was expected of them and tried to make good pictures out of it ; essentially that is what they do on assignment , no matter what government holds sway . " The most dangerous thing , " Mr. Zimmermann says , " was inside our minds . " The rules had been learned and internalized , forging " a scissors in your head " that automatically censored what would never get shown anyway . <p> And then the wall came tumbling down and everything changed : what people ate , what they wore , how to get subway tickets and credit cards , and how to deal with that new phenomenon , opportunity . Not all of this was for the better for photographers . Mr. Sandberg , who was on the staff of an East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then : he conferred on layout and once or twice a year did an end run around editor and party to get an essay the way he wanted it . Today , an assignment for Stern , the major German magazine , allows him no input whatever . <p> The photographers note that when they needed less to live on they had more time for their own projects , and even more time to think . Things move too fast now . The old way , of course , had certain disadvantages . Photographers adopted the motto , " In the average we are at the peak " ; it was not good to be better than that . Mr. Zimmermann says , " If nothing can happen to you , you have time to think about what you want and do what you want , but you never have a chance to do something big . " <p> Mr. Sandberg , who was brought up to believe in the socialist ideal by a father who was imprisoned for being a Communist and then put in a concentration camp for being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never worked . " In the closed society , you did n't have a chance to make your own personality , " he says . " You did n't have a chance to take risks , make decisions , fail , be successful . Yet if you can only walk in a little garden for many years , you see every flower , tree and bird . It gives you the possibility of concentrating yourself . Most East Germans just live to have bananas now . " <p> Some in Ostkreuz have discovered that paradoxically , they have simply exchanged one tyranny for another . It used to be the party . Now it is a magazine 's questionable taste , or illusions about life , or ideas about what will appeal to the masses . Mr. Zimmerman says that in the totalitarian system the reason a picture was not picked lay precisely in the picture itself : what it showed , what it said . No longer . Trendiness is now the criterion . The world today is in too much of a hurry to worry about making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the 1960 's we had six months for a story , in the 1970 's six weeks . Now it 's more like six hours . " <p> Besides , photojournalism is in some peril . " Twenty years ago people needed magazines , " Mr. Sandberg goes on . " Who needs them now ? We have TV . Newspapers are beginning to print in color . " This issue is bedeviling photographers everywhere . The magazine market emphasizes celebrity portraiture , color and single pictures that make a quick points rather than the complexity of a series . The pressure to be commercial makes it difficult to maintain an individual style . <p> Mr. Sandberg is convinced that the only way to do real photojournalism and get published in an important way in an important place today is to be a war photographer . " But I 'm in my mid-40 's , I have children , and I 'm not stupid enough to go into a war zone . " Instead , he is thinking of leaving Ostkreuz , which he founded with Werner Mahler , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by computer . With luck , he hopes to have time to do his own work and perhaps even keep his vision intact as opportunities for photojournalism dwindle . <p> East German photographers have had to adapt to a lot of change in a short time : first to the sport of Western competition and media enterprise , then to rules that changed while the game was still going on , and now to the fact that a lot of the spectators have simply gone home .
