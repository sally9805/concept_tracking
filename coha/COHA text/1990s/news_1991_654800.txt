<p> IN Ljubljana 's vibrant city center , street vendors hawk souvenir prototypes of Slovenian passports , their covers embossed with a linden leaf , the republic 's national symbol . <p> A few miles away , at a sprawling research and development complex on the outskirts of the Slovenian capital , government workers are designing a new , as yet unnamed , national currency . <p> Yugoslavia 's volatile federation of 45 years is crumbling . And if Slovenians have their way , cartographers will soon have to redraw the map of Europe to include at least one new independent state . <p> Yet the future of Yugoslavia 's most-prosperous republic is uncertain ; fraught with political upheaval and the threat of intervention by communist-led troops loyal to the central government . Call for independence Nevertheless , in a plebiscite in December nearly 90 percent of Slovenia 's voters said they wanted full sovereignty and supported a six-month timetable for independence . That timetable could be speeded by growing violence between Serbians and Croatians , the nation 's two largest ethnic groups , and by rising anticommunist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The leaders of Serbia and Croatia held a surprise meeting March 25 in an apparent effort to diffuse tensions . Tanjug news agency said Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman met for several hours at an undisclosed location . <p> Although the European Community and the United States have appealed for Yugoslavia to remain united , officials in Ljubljana say privately there are indications that Austria and Hungary would recognize Slovenia as a state . Slovenia , along with neighboring Croatia , have proposed that Yugoslavia 's six republics and two provinces form a loose federation of sovereign states . Croatia has vowed to follow Slovenia if it secedes . Serbia wants control Communist-ruled Serbia , Yugoslavia 's biggest republic , insists that it retain control , which the new center-right governments in Slovenia and Croatia have rejected . They remain at odds with the hard-line Mr. Milosevic , whose pro-Serbian policies have brought Yugoslavia to the brink of civil war several times and spurred protests in Belgrade . <p> " It is really unimaginable that Slovenia , a democratic country with a parliamentary system and respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , " says Vitodrag Pukl , deputy speaker of Slovenia 's Parliament , who is helping to draft a new constitution . He insists that in legal terms , Slovenia became independent on Feb. 20 , when it annulled the force of federal law on its territory . <p> Slovenia 's leaders say they want the separation to be peaceful and orderly . But there are lingering worries about how the national Army , whose officer corps is dominated by Serbs and communists , will react . Slovenian President Milan Kucan warns of possible military intervention if there is a power struggle . <p> If a clash does erupt , it would more likely pit Serbia against Croatia , two longtime rivals . The large Serbian minority in Croatia has already declared itself autonomous from the Croat government in the capital of Zagreb , and vows to join Serbia if a breakup occurs . <p> Serbia has threatened to absorb territories from adjoining republics heavily populated by ethnic Serbs . There have already been several violent confrontations between Serbs and Croats . <p> Price of independence But geography , ethnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any fighting . Slovenia 's only internal Yugoslav border is with Croatia , and it has no sizable minority groups . <p> " We hope this will make it possible to pull out of Yugoslavia in peace , " says Dusan Plut , a member of Slovenia 's presidency . <p> Although Slovenia is Yugoslavia 's most-developed republic , the transition could still be difficult . And while its production capacity is considerable , its economic survival is by no means assured . <p> Much of the mountainous republic 's production , though better than most in the nation , is far below Western competitive standards . Several economists have predicted independence could cause a 50 percent reduction in Slovenia 's gross national product - a drop that would bring at least temporary hardship to the republic 's 2 million inhabitants . <p> Other economic experts warn that Slovenia could find itself dependent on Austria and Italy , its prosperous Western neighbors . <p> " Slovenia could end up being sold at bargain prices because of the ruin communist mismanagement has caused , " says Alexander Bajt , a leading Slovenian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic market would also put pressure on the economy . Domestic trade accounts for about 30 percent of the republic 's exports and 25 percent of its imports . Domestic trade will be hurt , he says , if bellicose relations between republics continue and exports increase to the West . <p> But Slovenian officials say they 're confident that the economy will pick up speed once free-market reforms take hold and the republic is no longer required to help support Yugoslavia 's other impoverished republics . <p> Josip Skoberne of Slovenia 's Economic Chamber says about one-third of the republic 's products are competitive on world markets and that reforms could make another third competitive within years . Foreign investment , at a trickle because of Yugoslavia 's instability , will also increase after Slovenia becomes independent , government officials say . " This is critical if we are going to succeed , " Mr. Skoberne says . Squabbling over the debt Meanwhile , Slovenia and Croatia seek an accounting of Yugoslavia 's $17 billion foreign debt . They want an agreement to divide the nation 's assets between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talks will be tough . Slovenia says its share of the debt is $3 billion , including about $1.2 billion in interest costs . But poorer republics say Slovenia should take more of the debt because it benefited most from foreign credits . <p> Despite the bickering and brinkmanship , Slovenians say they will pursue an independent course . Says presidency member Plut : " Slovenians are prepared to suffer for their sovereignty . " <p> Fear of a violent breakup has lent urgency to Solvenia 's quest for autonomy . " We do n't want to be caught up in a civil war between feuding Yugoslav nations , " says Janez Kocijancic , a parliamentary deputy . " We want no blood in our streets . " <p> But , he adds , " the Slovenian nation has came to the irrevocable conclusion that life in Yugoslavia as it is now no longer makes any sense . "
