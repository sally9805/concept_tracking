<p> Crazy colored ladies <p> Wait <p> To be loved , <p> held , <p> cared for . <p> Crazy colored ladies <p> Are crazy from waiting . <p> Why ca n't <p> Crazy colored men <p> Understand that ? <p>  --  From " The Harlequin Cafe and other poems on sex , race and love " by Warren Brown <p> If the romantic picture for single African Americans were a Rorschach test , men and women would perceive two wildly divergent scenes . Inside the inkblot designs , men would describe a veritable paradise , a Garden of Eden overflowing with lush , available Eves . Women , on the other hand , would discern a barren wasteland of disappointment within the inky patterns , where desirable Adams are few and far between . <p> Maybe that 's why Larry E. Davis , associate professor of psychology and social work at Washington University in St. Louis , says that for many black people today  --  especially women  --  finding true love has reached a level of crisis . <p> " It 's just a mess out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not going well for us . " <p> In " Black and Single : Meeting and Choosing a Partner Who 's Right for You " ( Noble Press , $ 10.95 ) , the 47-year-old social scientist zeros in on the specific whys of the ubiquitous " a good man ( or woman ) is hard to find " syndrome in the black community , and offers practical suggestions on how to do better . <p> Going on professional experience and employing real-life anecdotes , Davis 's book reads like a folksy compendium of intelligible sociology and fatherly recommendations , with a smattering of statistics . Although there 's bound to be some racial overlap  --  sound advice is sound advice  --  he contends that three major characteristics distinguish the black experience when it comes to love . <p> For starters , the numbers are n't good . Nationally , he says , the majority of black adults are single , about 60 percent . In contrast , only about 40 percent of their white counterparts are not married . Davis adds that there are approximately eight black men for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution is about even . Also , two out of every three black marriages end in divorce , compared with one of every two white marriages ( and fewer blacks than whites ever remarry ) . <p> Second , income  --  or the lack of income  --  can upset the balance of power within intimate black relationships . Davis says that when white couples quarrel , the friction typically stems from how the financial resources should be distributed . But black twosomes are more prone to argue about having too few resources to share in the first place . <p> The final distinction is what Davis calls the " negative and unfair " perceptions among some blacks about one another that smack of racist stereotypes . These include applying Caucasian standards of beauty  --  such as skin color , facial features and hair texture  --  to potential partners , as well as making reckless generalizations about either gender based on past let-downs . Their jaded attitudes toward those of their own race can inhibit closeness . <p> Family therapist and Howard University counselor Audrey Chapman explores that stereotyping in her forthcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Women and the Battle for Love and Power " ( Henry Holt , $ 22.50 ) . <p> " African Americans are no different than others in the way we buy into the myths and stereotypes about ourselves , " Chapman says . " There 's this overdramatized myth about black women  --  that we 're all strong , powerful , overbearing , aggressive super-women . Or else we 're supposed to feel bad or ashamed because we 're not like that . " <p> Because this subject is so troubling especially to D.C. 's black singles , both Davis and Chapman will be participating as guest lecturers at the Smithsonian 's African American Studies Center lecture series on singles at the end of the month . <p> " I 'm speaking in generalities , of course , " Chapman says , " but there 's this idea that black men are not encouraged to be expressive or emotional . As a result , they 're unreliable , irresponsible , insensitive , noncommunicative , shiftless , worthless dogs . Not an attractive picture , is it ? " <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has a historical foundation . " Black women are very sensitive toward the issue of respect , " he says , " because they 've been mistreated and exploited for such a long time . " <p> " I think it all goes back to slavery times , when the family unit was broken up , " says Bonita Bennett , editor in chief of the Chicago-based magazine Being Single . " It 's something that has come down through many generations . Black people today do not grow up seeing a lot of romance in their homes . The struggle to survive does not allow for a romantic atmosphere , and a lack of love makes people angry . If the boy ca n't get no work , how 's he gon na get romantic ? Black people have plenty of sex , but that is not the same as making love . " <p> " That 's the truth , " says Denise Savage , 41 . The divorced Washingtonian , who dates " off and on , " directs legislative and regulatory affairs for a local HMO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of burden to be used and abused . We were not supposed to have feelings . So we have values that we do n't even know have been passed along . I 've had to survive on my own . And it seems that the stronger I get , the less attractive black men find me . I do n't feel that upbeat about the future , " she admits . " I 've pretty much resigned myself to being single . Sometimes I miss the companionship of marriage . I miss having that special someone in my life , someone to talk to that I do n't have to be so ... so guarded with . " <p> The theme of being afraid to remove one 's mask of indifference or machismo recurs among black singles because they anticipate that something bad will happen once they open up . And they share a unique history that supports being fearful . <p> " These concepts go back so far and down so deep , " says D.C. psychiatrist Denise Holland , medical director of outpatient services at St. Elizabeths Hospital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have seen so much violence and catastrophe that we are always reacting to that level of tension in our lives . There 's a suspicion that what you say may hurt you . So you can never just be yourself . But living with your guard up all the time eats away at you emotionally and physically . You 'll never have a comfortable , supportive love relationship if you 're out there trying to keep secrets . " <p> Janice Gump , a Washington psychologist , concurs about the legacy of slavery and its impact on love . <p> " We may be decades past it , " she says , " but whether we are conscious of it or not , our history is inside of us . The feelings of impotence , rage and sorrow beyond measure  --  have been passed down ... . Whatever happened to our parents has direct impact upon us , even if we do n't know the precise facts . And sadly , I think our culture overall undervalues the significance of developing a deep relationship . People act as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> And those " people " may come in either gender . Jeff Hardy , 41 , a never-married Washington correspondent for the Mobile ( Ala . ) Register , finds that some black women here pass over the " mere Alabama reporter " for the preferable member of the " upwardly-mobile black crowd making 100-plus a year . " <p> " Washington women go by what 's on the outside , " he says . " They 're more apt to look at your shoes , your suit , ask where you work . They have a specific image of who they want , and sometimes miss the good ones because they 're looking elsewhere . " <p> " Our hunger for status images comes from not having had much , " says Poussaint . " And that 's a problem because it keeps the depth out of our relationships . The materialistic demands by middle-class women on men ... creates a power-struggle among us . " <p> Hardy , who has two young sons by previous live-in relationships , admits that being an unmarried father may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " mere " professional status . At any rate , marriage is strictly optional for him , not a necessity . " If it does n't happen , " he says , " that 's just fine . " <p> But Larry Davis wonders about the kind of men and potential husbands Hardy 's two boys will grow up to be . <p> " Sixty percent of black families are female-headed , " he says . " Kids who perceive the world only through the eyes of their mothers will never get that dual perspective that comes from watching two parents relating to each other and negotiating . Consequently , they do n't know how black men feel because they 've been brought up with ' it 's either Mom 's way or no way . ' The deprivation of a male role model at home for the kids can be disastrous . Broken families , crime , black men and women not getting along  --  it 's all connected . " <p> Chapman agrees : " Black guys who do well have strong male role models . And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be any man who encourages you to work as much on your educational training as on physical virility . " <p> For Bonita Bennett , that man , besides being a role model , must be a black man who 's a composite of Einstein ( brains ) , the Marlboro man ( ruggedness ) and Denzel Washington ( basic heartthrob ) . <p> Does that sound just a tad unrealistic ? <p> " I figure if you stand at the bus stop long enough , the bus will eventually come , " says Bennett . " But I 'd never look for a white man . Because there 's nothing like the brother , honey . There is no deep voice in the world like a black man 's . It exudes character , soulfulness , earthiness and sensuality . " <p> Larry Davis admires Bennett 's affection for black men . " I always tell black women , try to be positive , try to be fair ... . Bitchy positions are defeminizing , they only hurt you . It may be cultural , but Roseanne Arnold is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " We black people can be less tender in our feelings , " says Janice Gump , " because we 've had to conceal our vulnerability . I 've had patients say , ' I 've had to be hard . ' So if we appear to be somewhat angry , well , we have lots to be angry about . It feels dangerous to be tender . The roots of it are in childhood , and by the time you 're an adult , it 's all set . " <p> Of course , the irony is that real intimacy demands risking vulnerability . <p> " It 's difficult to get underneath the jive , " acknowledges Gump . " I think what black men respond to more is that edge , that covering up of need . " <p> " Our problems are complicated , " Davis says . " But hostility leaves no room for sharing . She says , ' Hey , boy , I do n't need you ! ' and he says , ' You 're right , so why are we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a woman who 's more demanding of me than accept whatever minimum I have to offer , " says thirtysomething D.C. trial attorney Erroll D. Brown . The never-married Brown says he 's looking forward to settling down and having kids  --  eventually . For now , he finds himself consumed primarily with his practice , and enthusiastic about the opportunities available to him that did not exist for his parents . <p> " Being a black man and being a professional is one of the most exciting things in the world , " Brown says . " I own my own law firm , and that 's very rare . My sons will be able to say , ' Well , now I know that a black man can be a lawyer ! ' " <p> Until he went to college , Brown did n't realize that having grown up in a two-parent home was such a novelty . That 's why creating a solid family of his own someday and being a good father matters to him . <p> " Except for Bill Cosby , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . America sees us as being overly aggressive , hostile and altogether unappealing . I 've gone into court on a criminal case and the judge says , ' Are you a defendant ? ' As the old saying goes , you 're carrying on your shoulders the burdens of all black men ... . I also wonder if black women appreciate what we have to endure . " <p> On the amorous front , Brown is taking it slow with one " patient " woman . <p> " When you meet the woman for you , " he says , " you 're supposed to get this magical feeling . And I want to make sure I 'm going to stick with her always . " <p> So who is the ideal romantic partner for him ? <p> " I want to find , " he sighs , " my solitude in my companion .
