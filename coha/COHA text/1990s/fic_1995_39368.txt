First the sounds , the wheels bumping across the joints , punctuating the prolonged hiss of metal against metal . Then I notice my eyes are open . I notice the gray light pouring in through a narrow chink under the blind , so narrow that the compartment is still dark . Fatigue makes the sounds seem more powerful , though not louder , like a deaf person sensing the blast of an explosion , an unceasing series of silent concussions . Detached words emerge like objects half-buried in sand , and the train stops , I do not know where . Outside , unintelligible voices from a loudspeaker , not even distinguishable as language , only a rumbling , throaty sound , a clapping of shoes against flagstones , abating , and doors are banging , a whistle , squealing wheels , and I lie impassive , trouserless , in my darkness , behind the chink of daylight , while waves of sound roll over me , slowly washing fatigue from the darkness , world sound , community sound , State Railway sound , uncovering the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put aside , on the beach , for instance , in my sleep or some other time . At first smooth and rounded , the words seem to have lost their barbs , pincers , spikes , claws ; they slip , as a mountain climber tearing his nails bloody on a glacier , having lost his backpack , rope ladder , ice ax , or whatever it is they use to hold on with , sliding back into fatigue , the sound of the joints , the singing of metal , voices rolling over me and sucked back again , so that for a moment I am a smooth , wet mirror reflecting sky , clouds , anything , until I am once again flooded , whipped with frothy sounds in half-darkness and the water closes around my warm skin , receiving my body as I fall and <p> I turn around in the illuminated green fog , facing the bright mirror , letting myself be lifted upward , and break through . She is walking toward me , in slow motion because of the resistance of the water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her black bathing suit , her ribs stand out beneath the wet elastic fabric , her hair sticks to her head and her neck thick and dark , droplets sparkle in the eyelashes around her clear green , almost transparent <p> eyes , open , that saw nothing , the squares of light from the window reflected in her pupils , two quadrangles , two rectangles , convex , distended , shining opaquely on each side of a black cross : the mullions and the transoms of the window . We had no curtains , nobody saw us anyway , the house on the other side long since torn down , vanished in a yellowish brown , lazy billowing cloud of dust , plaster , rubble , rotten woodwork , scraps of wallpaper , rusty pipes , broken porcelain , crunching like sand between teeth . Afterward , only a hole remained between the facades , like a gap where a tooth has been pulled , knocked out in flight , a gulf of light in the block , like a mouth gaping against <p> Squeaking and shrilling , the vibrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer there . Sounds washing darkness from my head , the sound of wheels again more rapid , the light stronger , reflected in a shiny toenail , revealing a white foot , the green and red woolen flames of the carpet , green and red dashing past , ferns , sleepers , road stones , and after tightening and stretching , readjustment of the limbs , the abrupt retreat of the blind and alignment of the gazing muscle : something suggesting the ocean , a flat gray brim barred below by a metal strip inscribed E Pericoloso Sporgersi <p> I shoot forward again and swim toward the small pontoon that is anchored farther out and from which you can dive . When I swim like this , toward the sun , the water is a white resistant film of dazzling reflections speckled with black spots where the soft waves stir the surface . Turning to her , I see my body under the water , broken , enlarged as under a magnifying glass , against the yellowish green sandy bottom ribbed by the waves . A man and a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazy backlight . They jump simultaneously , the woman squeals , the movement makes the pontoon rock and strike the surface with wet smacks . I climb up and offer her a hand . The pontoon is covered with coir mat , wet , with threads of sea grass , tangled into the web of the mat . She lies on her stomach , her head resting on one arm , and looks into the water . The weight of her body flattens her breasts against the mat . From out here it is difficult to spot the villa , which is almost hidden behind the growth at the top of the cliff above the other houses , the hotels , the road edged with palm trees , and the beach with its rows of beach chairs , sun shades , and people standing , walking , lying in the sand . The pontoon is moving gently up and down , at intervals extending the shadow of my head to her elbow under the damp , loose-hanging hair smelling sharply of salt and something else , skin , body  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the tiny bleached hairs , and I say , think , half-aloud or silently , I do not remember which , something like this <p> At this moment . . . at this moment you are . . . right now it 's as if the sun is blinding me , turning away again , and I am looking out at factories , chimneys , silos , bridge constructions , power pylons , cables strung through the air , rising and falling outside my window , side by side , crisscrossing , and the tracks , side by side , so numerous that I am unable to make out which rails form pairs , long gleaming lines between the rusty stones and sleepers ; everything along the tracks is rusty : walls , plants , workmen 's sheds , concrete foundations , signal boxes , points , shunted freight wagons ; and , as an alien element rising behind the bristling antennas and the laundry lines , a church dome , its red tile like a distant signal in the sun . The light is dimmer under the huge glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resounding loudspeaker voices , the muffled names of towns and the voices surrounding me , the waiting travelers , the greetings of those just arrived and the impatient call of those departing , a porter in a blue frock , stooped , forehead beaded with sweat , pulling an old-fashioned luggage cart , two young tourists with bursting nylon backpacks and bare , sunburned legs , a man in a striped tie with a newspaper under his arm Corriere Della . . . half-hidden behind the raincoat he is carrying , a pale nun with flashing glasses and skin like rising dough , an old man with a gray face behind a gray beard in an overcoat smelling of urine , the neon sign lit from within , with the young woman in a black bathing suit , laughing with white teeth , the dark hair pasted to her head , beads of foam in the air around her as she wades through a green wave , tan , supple , hands stretched out , reaching for a green beach ball floating in the air above her , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea &; Sky . . . the newsstand collage of letters and glazed or blurred pictures of exposed muscle armor , exposed breasts with hard nipples , smoking , bombed-out towns , torn beyond recoginition , charred ... the hectic waiters in the station restaurant with their affected air of arrogance , orders shouted in shrill voices but nonetheless absorbed by the clamor of cups , glasses , the hissing fumes from the percolator , the rattling signs showing destinations and hours of departure . I make my way through the faces , the bodies , the names , the signs and the suitcases toward the large yellow poster with the printed caption Treni in Partenza , I go on until I am seated again with my forehead resting on a smooth , vibrating pane while the train rolls out from the platform , through the shunting yard 's snake pit of entangled rails , passing control towers and signal boxes , apartment houses with television antennas and wet sheets on clotheslines on the roofs , open shutters revealing bedrooms and kitchens with naked light bulbs dangling from the ceiling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hair pins and coins of no value under the cracked flagstone floors , like the gray dusty back of a large set piece , the junkyards , the tenement houses , the cables strung through the air , the zigzag-folded skylight windows of the factories for a second reflecting the hazy shine of the sun , before the train , the sounds of wheels , buffers , rails , joints , unfamiliar voices , names and words , only half-intelligible behind the red haze , the blood in my eyelids illuminated by the sun , the verdigris green , saffron yellow and rosy pink slowly receding outline of things on the other side of this averted <p> face , half-buried in white cotton with gray creases where only a reflection of the light from the window fell in , soft pockets of half-darkness like tracks in the sand , dunes in a desert landscape , hunches and pits in the closely woven covers , fluffing slightly from numerous washings . A face that drowned in a dry wave of hair that had rolled over the cheek and not yet retreated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each hair its own cowlick , its own shade of brown , chestnut , latakia , mold , foaming hair that had hit the slightly domed cheek like a blow and found rest in the furrow under the cheekbone , like a blow transformed into a caress , a single hair quivering delicately beneath her nose , the idea of this warm stream of air from the densely packed space under the skin where the body has a life of its own , in darkness , under domes , between pillars of cartilage and bone . A face halfhidden behind hair and blanket , the furrowed banks of the lips enclosing a winding string of darkness , silence , listening to this subdued murmur from the body as she opened her eyes , suddenly and without blinking , and the sky between the window frames and the posts cut into the iris and the black pupils that quickly contracted , shrank and were again separated from the light by the moist eyelids , I am invisible again , waiting on the other side of her face , outside her body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I happened to see her one day , without recognizing her at first . It was only for a moment , through the bus window , standing with her back to the street in front of a shop , her face and figure reflected in the pane , that was all , the bus stopped farther on and I got off . She was still standing there , motionless before her own reflection , absorbed in something , herself , a displayed item in the half-darkness behind the glass . I did not recognize the dress , flowered , longish , tightened at the waist with a leather belt . She might have bought it a few minutes ago and put it on in the shop , but she was not carrying a bag , her hands were empty , hanging beside her flowered hips , like a child paying attention . She might have pitched it into a garbage can , left it on a bench , nobody noticing , nobody running after her You forgot your bag ! Or she might have had it for a long time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not worn it while we knew each other . The flowers might suggest it , small , faded , possibly roses , difficult to determine from that distance , twenty yards or so , roses like the ones your grandmother , serving pancakes in the kitchen , impossible to tell , could have come back into fashion . Young girls appearing everywhere in the faded cotton of a distant past , fragile , thin , like ghosts . She did not see me . Not even when she turned around for a moment , as if she felt someone watching her , as if someone in the passing crowd on the sidewalk had spoken her name , as if our eyes had met for a moment through the wash of faces constantly moving in the bright backlight , shimmering in the heat and the car exhaust , before she turned again , her light , rather drifting steps and the flimsy fabric mimicked in the smoke-colored pane of a bank . I could have called out to her Alice ! and she would have stopped , turned around at the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange faces , my hand waving above their swaying heads , until I had caught up with her , to the place where she stood , where I had seen her from the bus , smiling , until her hands , lips , until the warm stream of air from her lips , her body . .. I did not call out , let her continue , continued myself , still about twenty yards between her movable flower bed , the nape of her neck , the back and forth of her ankles across the pavement and my own , following her without coming any closer . <p> No stranger would believe that there was a connection between this young woman in the flowered dress and this particular young man who was pushed forward at random by the crowd in the same direction as she , traversing a crosswalk a little way along the opposite sidewalk , passing a cast-iron gate , with foliage sticking out , eagerly , avidly , pleading , through the entrance gate to the park , continuing along the wide graveled paths between the lawns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , between balls , seagulls and a fountain 's extended , renewed fall of detached , shattered , shapeless entities of water through the air . Not even here below the rustling leaves of the crowns , among the sporadic outcries of children and seagulls , indiscreet and foreign , no contact here either , she was sitting on one of the benches by the round pond , with floating ice-cream paper and dead leaves from last year , ducks among the alternating reflections of the sky and the trees , disturbed and mingling in concentric folds on the surface <p> that seemed to double them as they spread and expanded , eventually bursting against the side of the pond , and were regenerated as small circles with rapidly increasing radii to the bronze swan and the boy of the same metal , his hand grasping the bird 's neck where the jet of water shot up into the light , caught by the light in a towering , shattered jet which was scattered before the wind in a foam of sparkling drops . I was standing near the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flaked bark of a chestnut tree , hidden from her in the shadow under the dense foliage , she as someone unknown and unapproachable on the bench with the hollow of her knee resting on the knee of the other leg , her shoe dangling from the tip of her toe , gazing at what ? now stooped , now with a cigarette between her lips , looking for something in her purse , probably a lighter , a box of matches , now addressing the passing male figure who stopped and concealed her completely from me , disappeared from head to toe , impossible to hear what was said , a moment later both were sitting on the bench smoking . Nothing indicated whether they knew each other , not the way she answered , smiling , not his stooped way of asking something , listening and nodding congenially , his legs crossed too , surprisingly intimate if they did not know each other , but no , shortly after he got up again , and she did not look in his direction as he left along the path and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom ? the fountain , the floating ducks , ice-cream paper , shining coins below the ridged reflection of the clouds , children on bicycles , the foliage , me behind the chestnut ? No , she could not have seen me , or she was remarkably good at ignoring me . I did not exist there , did not belong in this image , the park , the trees , the fountain , ducks and children . Her name was not necessarily Alice . She could have been sitting there , gotten a light from a stranger and listened to the wind in the leaves , the splashing of water , the shrieks of children and seagulls , without my observing it , beyond the range of this gaze that did not catch on , repelled the slightest attempt at connecting . Or I was a stranger , could have been a stranger , stooped beside her on the bench with a light and crossed legs , she could have sat on the bench in the park for an instant and then no more , period , only a dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a radiant , billowing cloud of gravel , water , leaves , windows , faces and chromed parts on the bodies of the passing cars that shone silvery in the sun <p> penetrating the glass , the fabric , the skin , the blood , the flesh , sinking into my blindness like wheels on rails , like a low voice speaking to me , the heat , shapeless , incorporeal and yet palpably present , like the voices , positioned differently in the perspective on the other side of this nonbody pressing against my chest and breathing into my face , voices without bodies , drifting , fluttering , clapping like hands , rattles , wings , like the noise from a complex mechanism , the speech of men and women , impossible to distinguish sentences , words , just this clatter in the air , like something moving on hinges , opening and closing with the draft , this stream of air from the body , the stomach , the lungs , the throat hissing , chattering , jabbering through me , through this wide-open ear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been reduced to a scaffold , a skeleton , an incomplete building , abandoned , forgotten , left to decay , and comprehending nothing . The heat , the voices , the rhythmic sound of wheels passing across joints , penetrating me , waves , shocks , vibrations transmitted to the flesh , and I do not comprehend it , no longer able to speak to anyone in my own language , just wanting to walk and stand or sit in the sun , look at the colors and movements of an unfathomable world , listen to its abstract music , nothing more , a man , walking , standing , sitting , the very least one can be , outside the world , because I am unable to speak , a part of the world , because all that I do will be as simple and unambiguous as only facts can be . A foreign language chants under the vault of my skull , and the heat dries me out , until I am a light construction of leather , bone , cartilage , and membrane , rattling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those early airplanes , sketched in scratchy feather on parchment of about the same color as <p> the moon , scarcely visible above the mountains behind the pine grove , partly dissolved in diluted blue . I listen to the crickets . The sound is there whether I listen to it or not . I ca n't distinguish one cricket from the other . It is that same dry wash of sound approaching and receding over and over . The mist from the ocean , evaporating in the heat , blurring the view from the terrace . From my beach chair beside Alice , the ocean is only a slightly darker blue band below the sky , woven through the oval balusters , the tall cactus lined up in wide pots and Michael 's averted body , his oblong back above a pair of creased canvas trousers , naked , bisected by the furrow along the spine , forming a slightly curved S , his back like a soft V between the shoulders and the pelvic bone , tan , only a shade lighter than the burned clay of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies of plants , behind the cars passing by down on the highway , radio commercials and pop tunes blaring out from the lowered windows , he must have a view of the beach with the pebbly sand , the tan people , faces behind sunglasses , inflated playthings , naked children at the waterline , their cries and voices behind the passing music like invisible waves , a foaming , now distant , now closer , like the offshore waves drawing darker diagonal lines across the scattered glittering of the water surface in the intensifying afternoon sun , still possible to see the sandy bottom from up here , with its varying shadows of seaweed suggesting uninhabited continents in an untamed , preglacial world . The horizontal line is nearly erased , the sky and the ocean almost one in the mist , an open , indefinite space between the rocks rounding off the small cove like two gigantic crab claws . Behind the square pontoon , which is anchored further out , he can probably discern a few windsurfers , barely moving in the soft wind , floating on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the colors of their sails indistinct in the blinding milky sheen . Alice holds out her glass and makes the ice cubes chink with an impatient movement of her hand . Michael turns around , he is coming toward us , already reaching out for the glass , his face impassive , the narrow mouth , <p> the narrow , hooked nose , eyes hidden behind the narrow sunglasses beneath the white cloth that he has tied around his head as protection from sun , like a pirate , Captain Hook , but he has two hands , one closing around the glass , his fingers covering hers for a moment , before he takes the glass , only a split second longer than I had expected the movement to last , before he has turned again , now facing the open door of the house behind us , no longer visible , now present only in this whisper of hard skin under dry , bare feet against the flagstones of the terrace , abating , and now he is inside the house . <p> Her bare , softly arched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distended cactus break the woolen horizontal line above the balustrade now . Above her brown , shining body with the slightly paler breasts , above the red tile of the roof , far behind the hillsides covered with pine , cypress , olive and scrub , I can see the gray massif of the mountains , in the evening an elusive brim of purple . She is not moving , she looks as if she is asleep . A drop of sweat is making its way from her collarbone to the space between her breasts . At this moment the drop of sweat is the only thing moving on her , but she is not asleep . She turns her face slightly toward me , and as she speaks to me , I suddenly see my own reflection doubled in her sunglasses <p> Shall we go ? <p> Michael returns , appears from the darkness of the house like a body surfacing from the depths of a well , a missing corpse , inflated , floating , almost absorbed by the black water , suspended for a moment in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , us , the pale blue horizon , impossible to tell , his eyes hidden behind the dark glasses , as if the darkness had sailed across his face , until he comes back out , this time to hand Alice the filled glass with a fresh slice of lemon attached to the rim , a secret sign as in the ads , Martini Bianco , these brown , wonderful people , immediately returning to the cool dim of the villa . Soon after , I hear the typewriter . Now and then the sound disappears , it disappears and returns without any regular rhythm , a monotonous series of taps or just one tap , a comma in the verbiage of crickets , locusts , car radios , swimmers . I can hear every word he writes , but not which one , every letter , but not whether it is a vowel or a consonant , a comma , a period , a question mark . I can hear it every time he hesitates <p> Did n't you hear what I said ? <p> Now and then I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upside down , children and adults , a young recruit in uniform , the soldier with his girl , a family picnic , in front of a fountain and at the dinner table , smiling with red eyes in the chalky light of the flash , friendly , vacant eyes turned toward the observer , the invisible camera lens , an impossible point beyond time . The two women are both plump , dressed in sleeveless , flowered dresses , exposing their pale vaccination scars . They are sitting beside each other on the same scat , one holding the pictures in a small pile in her lap , taking one at a time and giving it to the other one who takes it , so that for a moment they are both holding on to the picture , as if they were about to fight over it , as if the other wanted to check the pictures with her fingers and perhaps reveal a touch-up , a successful forgery , as if the first woman is trying to defend , cover up something exceedingly intimate , shameful , a dreadful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likeable family . She quickly hands the other woman a new picture  --  a diversion ?  --  as if to keep her from examining the pictures too closely , perhaps discovering that tiny detail at the bottom , behind the people , the small chip that has come off , the crack in the setting that shatters the illusion , allowing something horrible to appear in all its inconceivability , at once transforming the cordial smiles of the family members into treachery 's , secrecy 's conspiracy 's mask of depravity . <p> Her face constantly transformed , I am not sure that I remember her correctly , the way she looked ; I can not picture her . She was never the same , never exactly the way she had been the day , the moment before . I never photographed her , do n't own a single photograph , not even one of those taken in a red booth at a station , a strip of four , Adjust Stool and Wait for the Red Light , grimacing with an extended tongue and eyes wide open , slightly overexposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person on the other 's lap , or alone after all , eyes closed because of the light of the flash and this dreamless expression , hypnotized , sedated , this drooping state , the face no longer a reflection of the soul , more like its molehill . Her face is like one of those puzzle cubes one gives to bright children , impossible to put together once they have been taken apart , a cube of irregular wooden pieces cut out to fit into each other that end up at the bottom of the toy drawer among toy cars with no wheels , Parcheesi pieces and plastic Indians with the upper parts of their bodies missing . I remember nothing but isolated features , a heap of loose seconds , the distinct nose , the wrinkles around the wings of her nose when she smiled , like whiskers , the heavy eyebrows that concealed part of her eyelids , this gaze from deep within , her lips of the same color as her skin , often dry and chapped , the ; fold of her upper lip when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , her edged chin , as if carved out in marble , like marble covered with skin , and it never comes out as anything more than the sum of details , jigsaw pieces with far too much , still more space between them . Only her voice is always there <p> Did n't you hear what I said ? <p> not what she said , but the sound of her body , deeper than you had expected , slightly hoarse , this noise that constantly surrounded the sentences and sometimes threatened to devour them or crush them at birth , these gratuitous cracks , chinks , and chips in her speech , as if an invisible disintegration had already set in , the words already not to be taken at face value , as if the voice were returning to a preverbal state , not that of the child , but of a different time , beyond , like the stones of ancient ruins that are gradually repossessed by oblivion . Perhaps she was asleep again , but I was n't certain , her body , naked on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying on her side , knees bent , her calves brought together , her behind pushed forward , buttocks shining in the even , gray light , reflecting each other along a curved axis , expanding in a bushy darkness between her thighs , the projection of the hipbone and the soft concavity of the waist contrasting with the dimmer , more distant parts of the room , a long arm stretched out in an open angle below her face . Perhaps she was still awake , perhaps not , a warm , obscure , hieroglyph breathing calmly , now and then quivering as if suffering shocks , chills , bad dreams , her arm stretched out before her face on the pillow , as on a frieze in a tomb among cats and slaves , addressing what ? whom ? I could not read this body , this sign of bone , flesh and hair . Now and again I asked her What are you thinking about ? Nothing she replied . The house we lived in was to be torn down too , most of the tenants already relocated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always a rattling briefcase in his hand , only the stray cats with dusty , torn fur , and the junkies , huddled up in the basement passage , faces thin and transparent like paper , an occasional rat . Soon the entire street , what used to be a street , would be an empty cleft in the eroding massif of the town , still expanding , an open mouth gaping still wider , as at the dentist 's , bristling with instruments , drills , cranes , gigantic wrecker 's balls . <p> Soon the entire town would be a shell , hollowed out from within , a fence of skyscrapers protecting nothing , keeping strangers from breaking into nothing , a bottomless pit of light between the abandoned launching pads of the blocks , satellite towns , empty parentheses along freeways , loops and viaducts . I sat on the bed and tied my shoes , felt her hand on my knee , the heat from her palm through the fabric , and looked at the squares of light from the window , doubled in her pupils as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the gum curling around her teeth , carnivorous , but also exposed , like a nearsighted child . <p> Translated by Ida Mackintosh and Tonny Pedersen <p> JENS CHRISTIAN GRONDAH <p> Former coeditor of the prominent Danish quarterly Fredag , Jens Christian Grondahl ( b. 1959 ) writes novels in which the language itself and its movements are both medium and message . He seeks to make of language a model of consciousness , sense , and time , where all of experience , past and present , fill the flowing moment like a sea of lava or the course of a river . This is illustrated in bevaegeiser ( Movements of a Journey ) , which takes the form of a train trip from Denmark to Italy , with all the metaphoric implications of the journey and its movements reflected in the prose as well as in the specific " story . " It is gathering of fragments of consciousness , memory , sense , and impressions with a Joycean simultaneity of time , reflecting Grondahl 's origins as a poet and his education as a film director at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the prestigious Literature Prize of the Nordic Council . In his own words , Grondahl views the novel as " an architecture of sentences ... a way to structure the vacuum in which the reader finds himself with his interpretations and sensibilities , experience and personality with which to give the work meaning . " <p> Jens Christian Grondahl 's other novels are Kvinden i midten ( The Woman in the Center , 1985 ) , Syd for floden ( South of the River , 1986 ) , Det indre blik ( The Inner Gaze , 1990 ) , and Dagene skilles ( Parting of the Days , 1992 ) . Jens Christian Grondahl 's books are published in Denmark by Vindrose Publishers ( Copenhagen ) . <p>
