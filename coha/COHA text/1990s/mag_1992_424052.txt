How the Wise Use Movement employs corporate money and questionable tactics to stake its claim to public lands . <p> " Our goal is to destroy , to eradicate the environmental movement . " Ron Arnold <p> <p> IT IS CLEVER , CALLOUS , politically astute , and very well funded . It is the dark side of conservation , environmentalism 's evil force . And at a time when a spectrum of environmental organizations are having to trim staffs and mark time , it seems to be expanding exponentially . It is the Wise Use Movement , and its chilling agenda includes : Breaking up the National Park Service . Opening all national parks and wilderness areas to mineral and energy production . Clearcutting all ancient forests using the bizarre argument that " decaying and oxygen-using " old-growth contributes to global warming . A major 20-year construction program to build lodging and concessions in national parks . A public land give-away : redefining grazing rights to " recognize that these ranches are not public lands but split-estate lands , co-owned by government and the rancher . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off-road vehicles ( ORVs ) . Immediately developing petroleum resources in Alaska 's pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) . <p> They must be kidding , you say ! What and who is the Wise Use Movement ( WUM ) ? Is n't it just a new Sagebrush Rebellion ? Ca n't it be dismissed as another group of strident right-wing kooks ? Wo n't it wither under the righteous light of scientific reason ? <p> No-on all counts . Wise use has been with us since Day One . Gifford Pinchot , father of the National Forest Service and the man who coined the word " conservationist , " argued for the controlled and " wise use " of natural resources . Conservationist Pinchot was a good friend of preservationist John Muir , founder of the Sierra Club . Both were trusted advisors to President Theodore Roosevelt as well as point men in the fight against rapacious monopolistic exploitation of the West . They were ecological pioneers at a time when few believed that America 's natural resources could possibly be limited . <p> Muir , who found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought exploitation because he held nature sacred : " The clearest way into the Universe , " he wrote , " is through a forest wilderness . " Pinchot , who equated natural resources with national prosperity , fought exploitation because he recognized natural limits . Nature , like time and money and every other resource , must be " used wisely " . Muir had his victories  --  Roosevelt saved the Grand Canyon from mining interests in 1906  --  but Pinchot 's progressive or wise-use precepts shaped the early days of conservation , emphasizing use for the public good over private gain , and giving us such important principles as multiple use , scientific management , and sustained yield . <p> The Muir-Pinchot alliance ( and friendship ) foundered on the cliffs of Yosemite National Park . Pinchot , calling it a " wise use , " supported flooding the beautiful Hetch Hetchy Valley to supply San Francisco with water and electric power . Muir likened the proposal to damming a cathedral to make an urban water tank . But Pinchot , branding his opposition " misinformed and unreasonable nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U. S. government once declared " inalienable for all time " was ordered drowned for the public good . The year was 1913 . <p> The popular embrace of Muir 's preservationist views has been more recent . The more finite our resources seem , the more precious they become . As species disappear , we recognize the need for diversity . As the effects of wetland loss multiply , we move to save what 's left . As crowds clog Yosemite , we realize more fully what we lost at Hetch Hetchy . A movement is born , and the Earth gets its Day . <p> But Newton told us that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction . His principle would seem to apply to society as well as physics . Movements beget countermovements . Given the growing strength and success of preservationist environmentalism , the re-emergence of wise use as a movement should surprise no one . It has done so , however , with many environmentalists either unaware of WUM and its agenda , or else discounting it as a minor brushfire of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use victories : The Vision for the Future document , a plan to protect Yellowstone National Park and its surrounding 12-million-acre ecosystem , was gutted when WUM out-organized and out-shouted both bureaucrats and environmentalists at public hearings . The $1.9-million New York Bond Act of 1991 , which included $800 million for land protection , was defeated after the New York Farm Bureau launched a major media campaign attacking the " Land Grabbing Bond Act " as a threat to individual property rights . $30 million in gasoline taxes was siphoned off a highway and mass-transit bill to build trails that will open up wilderness areas to off-road vehicles . Japanese manufacturers of ORVs are major financial supporters of WUM . General Electric announced it would not renew its multi-million-dollar funding of " World of Audubon " TV specials . In a massive fax and letter campaign , WUM threatened GE with a boycott following specials on ranching and logging . Similar WUM campaigns led Stroh 's Brewery and the Ford Motor Company to pull sponsorship of Audubon specials . <p> The Wise Use Movement is an umbrella covering hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies to ranchers and real estate developers , and there is nothing new to their central philosophy  --  the removal of any and all restrictions to the exploitation of nature . What is new is the coalition and the savvy use of grass-roots activism to mask a corporate agenda of continued exploitation . <p> The coalition was born in 1988 when 250 groups , ranging from the American Mining Congress to the National Rifle Association , the American Motorcyclists Association to the National Cattlemen 's Association , gathered at the Bellevue , Washington , offices of The Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise . They were joined there by relics of the Sagebrush Rebellion , the naive and underfunded effort during the Carter and Reagan years to have federal lands turned over to the states and to private interests . <p> The purpose of the Bellevue meeting was to find a common ground from which to fight environmentalism . The timing was fortuitous : three major pieces of legislation  --  renewal of the Endangered Species Act , renewal of the Clean Water Act , and repeal of the 1872 Mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in formation of a working coalition united by two correlating goals : to curb any constraints on the use of private land and to abolish all limits to the abuse of public land . <p> Specific goals were spelled out in The Wise Use Agenda ( excerpted above ) , the bible of the movement . Taken together , they call for turning the clock back to the very beginning of conservation . <p> Hosts for the meeting were Allan Gottlieb and Ron Arnold . The two men are the gurus of WUM , and their backgrounds explain much about how the Wise Use Movement differs from the Sagebrush Rebellion . Gottlieb is a sophisticated fund raiser for conservative causes ( perhaps a bit too sophisticated ; he was sent to prison for a year in 1984 for filing false income tax returns ) . He runs a direct-mail network built while raising money for the NRA , claims to have a list of more than five million potential contributors , and is busy gathering fistfuls of funds to fight environmentalists . <p> Ron Arnold , author of The Wise Use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destroy the environmental movement . He is the Benedict Arnold of environmentalism , a former Sierra Club activist who has torn whole chapters from the textbook of grass-roots activism and used them to rewrite industry 's rules of engagement . Organize grass-roots organizations , Arnold told Canadian timber executives in a 1989 speech . They can " evoke powerful archetypes such as the sanctity of the family , ... form coalitions to build real political clout , ... be an effective and convincing advocate for your industry . " They can , he told the timbermen , " do things industry ca n't . " <p> If you 're going to exploit nature , Arnold seems to reason , why not exploit your workers as well ? And so we see all of the activist 's tools  --  petition drives , fax and letter campaigns , protest meetings , media events , lobbying and organizing  --  brought into play as Arnold fans the flames of populist fear to create a smoke screen for big business . Too often today , the " environmental activist " you see on the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Washington , D.C. , 300 activists worked the halls of Congress , staged media events , and pressed bureaucrats over the fate of wetlands , fisheries , national forests , and endangered species . It was the September " Fly-in for Freedom , " a carefully organized and orchestrated WUM lobbying effort . " Wear work clothes , " organizers told participants , " with special attention to gloves , boots , hard hats , bandanas ... " The working-class getup proved to be far more effective than the pin stripes of most industry lobbyists . In Portland , Oregon , 12,000 loggers rallied to protest curbs on clear-cutting . TV coverage made the spotted owl look like the Willy Horton of the environment . No one mentioned that the men had been given a paid day off to attend the rally , with lunch and transportation provided by the timber companies . And no one mentioned the Bureau of Land Management report showing that 15,000 jobs could be saved with a ban on the export of raw timber . In Bozeman , Montana , 700 WUM supporters overwhelmed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They simply out-organized us , " rued Ed Lewis of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition . But there was more than organization involved . The region was flooded with rumors that Yellowstone National Park was to be expanded five-fold , and that hunting , fishing , mining , and logging would be banned . Pre-hearing rallies whipped the crowd into near hysteria , and Yellowstone Superintendent Robert Barbee found himself accused of being everything from a communist to a Nazi . <p> It 's not difficult to expose the sham . The Oregon Lands Coalition , which organized the Portland protest , began its life housed in the Association of Oregon Industries office . The Council for Solid Waste Solutions shares office space with its parent , The Society of the Plastics Industry , Inc . The National Wetlands Coalition ( NWC ) , another industry arm hiding behind a feel-good name , professes to redress problems small landowners have with wetlands regulation . Actually , as Sen. John Chafee ( R-R.I. ) pointed out in a speech last year , its membership roster " reads like a Who 's Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Amoco . BP , Chevron , Exxon , Marathon Oil , and dozens more who do not see wetlands as natural filtration systems . NWC , in a bit of literary legerdemain , says it supports the goal of no overall loss of wetlands " as long as no net loss remains a goal " and does not become the law . <p> People for the West ! ( PFW ) , which led the fight at Yellowstone , was formed by John Wilson , head of the Western States Public Lands Commission , to fight repeal of the 1872 Mining Law ( which allows mining companies that find deposits to buy public land for no more than $5.00 per acre ) . It 's no surprise that People for the West ! is one of the best-funded WUM groups ( see sidebar ) ; founder Wilson is CEO of Pegasus Gold , and in 1991 , 12 of PFW 's 13 board members were mining company executives . When PFW turned out 500 people ( vs. 50 environmentalists ) to speak against mining law reform at a congressional hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by having Phelps-Dodge and Molycorp bus employees in from around the state . It also bused in school children to wave placards proclaiming the PFW vision that repeal would destroy families and communities alike , ultimately causing deterioration of values and the American way ! <p> Never mind that mining companies have a long history of unsafe working conditions , union busting , and pay and benefit cutting . Never mind that overgrazing destroys the land ranchers says they 're fighting to protect . Never mind that shipping raw logs overseas costs more jobs than all the spotted owls and environmentalists put together . The recession has hit hardest where jobs are most tenuous . Rural America is a vast pool of land-bound workers  --  miners , loggers , ranchhands , farmers , and fisherman  --  fearful for their future . Drowning people grab first the lifeline , and ask later who 's pulling them in ; a jobless worker with a mortgage and family to feed has little sympathy for an endangered species when his own habitat is threatened . <p> The cynical manipulation of workers , who have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible in part because the environmental movement has let its grassroots atrophy . Environmental groups do n't have WUM 's huge reservoir of corporate funding ; limited monies have increasingly been funneled to fight Reagan-Bush efforts to gut national legislation . At the same time , legitimate fears about lost jobs have not been addressed , and individual injustices , especially in wetlands enforcement , have been ignored . A gulf has grown between Environmentalism with a capital " E " and people with a small " p , " to the point that Ron Arnold gets knowing nods when he charges that the environmental movement has an anti-human agenda . Charles Cushman , of the National Inholders Association , goes even further , railing that preservation is " a new religion , a new paganism , that worships trees and sacrifices people . " Inholders , people who own property inside national parks and recreation areas , have an understandably jaundiced view of federal land management , and Cushman is the charismatic organizer of the property rights movement . " It 's a holy war , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a somewhat ironic statement , given the Wise Use Movement 's odd affiliation with the Rev. Sung Yung Moon . One of the shakers in the Wise Use Movement is the American Freedom Coalition ( AFC ) , founded by Rev. Moon 's chief U.S. lieutenant , Bo Hi Pak . Ron Arnold is on the Washington state board of the AFC , and another WUM grass-roots organizer , Merrill Sikorski , is a paid AFC staffer . Jon Roush of Canyon Consulting in Montana believes Moon is using the Wise Use Movement as a means to further the establishment of his far-right political base . <p> " This is a war zone , " Arnold told ABC News . Environmentalists should prepare for a battle that will be fought everywhere from the trenches to the commander-in-chief 's office . WUM is well organized , extravagantly funded , and has proven it knows how to motivate the troops . It also has friends in high places . The cover photo on The Wise Use Agenda shows Allan Gottlieb arm-in-arm with a grinning George Bush . And does anyone need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked to sabotage wetlands protection as well as federal clean air and recycling regulations ? <p> The fight is not over jobs . Those loggers in Portland are out of work despite the fact that cutting in Oregon 's national forests has increased 16 percent in the past decade . Environmentalism is not their problem ; exportation and automation are . The fight is what park historian Alfred Runte calls " a battle for leftovers " ( " A Word to the Wise , " National Parks , May/June 1992 ) . Industry , having squandered natural resources to the point of scarcity , can find no room for conservation compromise . Just as the extractors and exploiters have taken pages from the notebooks of social and environmental activism , so now must environmentalists re-read their tattered notebooks , nurture their grass roots , and tear the mask of respectability from the face of the Wise Use Movement . The failure to do so will surely sanction a thousand replications of Pinchot 's success in Hetch Hetchy Valley . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : An early " wise-use " battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above ) polarized the conservation movement in the early 1900s . John Muir and his supporters lost the fight in 1913 , when a dam ( left ) was built , permanently submerging the valley . It is the only dam ever to be constructed in a national park . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> This article is the first in a three-part series .
