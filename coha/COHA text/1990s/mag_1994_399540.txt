When it comes to buying cars , smart shoppers look for models with a long record of reliability . If you are among the estimated 40 million Americans investing in mutual funds these days , you 'd be wise to do the same . Today , after an unsettling six-month period that saw three out of four stock funds ( and nine of 10 bond funds ) lose money as the dollar , the Dow and bond prices all drooped , this 51-page special report will help you do precisely that . ( Our complete midyear performance update , which includes our biggest-ever midyear ranking of 3,045 mutual funds , begins on page 50 . ) If you 're looking for the best place for your fund money today ( and who is n't ? ) , remember this above all : The handful of fund managers who have regularly outperformed the pack  --  such as Shelby Davis of $1 billion New York Venture , pictured at right  --  are likely to continue doing superior jobs of building up your capital . Of course , that does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 favored funds suffered declines in this year 's stormy first half . Yet seven of our stalwarts kept losses below that of the average fund in their categories . And with fears about 5%-plus inflation and a sub-100-yen dollar continuing to spook investors , holding down losses can be just as important as maximizing gains . Hence , in this story , we present a midyear roster of 10 exceptionally durable top performers , each chosen for an uncanny ability to outpace its peers in a variety of market conditions dating back to 1986 . So what about that old numbing phrase so familiar to veteran fund consumers : Past performance is no guarantee of future results ? Well , here 's a new twist . Says statistician and pension consultant Mark Cunningham : " The majority of money managers are unpredictable . But a few  --  maybe 15 or 20 out of 1,000  --  are so consistent that we can predict from their past records that they will continue to outperform their competitors . " Cunningham , director of the investment consulting subsidiary of Buck Consultants , a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose money managers using statistical techniques identical to those that automakers employ to evaluate manufacturing quality . He says that studies purporting to show that past performance has no predictive power are flawed . For example : They typically look at how many of the funds in the top fifth or quarter of their categories keep that rank the next year . But such rigid yardsticks , he says , arbitrarily exaggerate swings in fund performance . For example , a fund that moves from the bottom of the first quintile to the top of the second 20% really has n't fallen much . Under the terms of many studies , however , it would be deemed inconsistent . Instead , says Cunningham , who advised us in our search for today 's most reliable competitors , analysts should measure performance by looking at precisely how each fund fared against its rivals over many time periods . That 's exactly what we 've done . Specifically , here 's how we found our 10 sultans of steadiness : We asked the Chicago fund ranking service Morningstar Inc. to examine performance records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least since 1986  --  a cutoff that allowed us to include the many worthy funds launched in the great wave of fund proliferation in the mid- ' 80s . We measured the funds ' total returns over 23 separate , overlapping three-year periods , with a new one beginning each quarter ( the first was Jan. 1 , 1986 to Jan. 1 , 1989 ; the final one was June 1 , 1991 to June 1 , 1994 ) . Going back 8X years , says Ken Gregory , editor of the No-Load Fund Analyst ( $195 a year ; 800-776-9655 ) , " is long enough to see if a fund 's strategy is successful . " Gregory adds that examining a series of three-year periods , as we did , allows you to test funds under a range of conditions . For example : the sharp downturns of October 1987 , the summer of 1990 , and February through April of this year . To make the comparisons of money-management skill as precise as possible , we did not include sales loads in figuring performance . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true competitors , using 10 categories that we believed would produce the most useful results . We divided funds that focus on large U.S. companies ( total stock market value of $5 billion or more ) into three groups based on the investing style : value , seeking issues that are cheap relative to their earnings or assets ; growth , buying shares of companies that can sustain earnings increases of 15% or more ; and blend , which combines the two . We created one category for all funds investing in small companies ( below $1 billion in market value ) ; one for those buying mid-size firms ( $1 billion to $5 billion ) ; and one for international funds investing exclusively outside the U.S. We broke bond funds into four groups : short term ( portfolios holding bonds with average maturities of four years or less ) ; intermediate and long term ( maturities of longer than four years ) ; high yield ( junk bonds ) ; and mortgage backed ( Government National Mortgage Association bonds and similar securities ) . Morningstar ranked funds in each category @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for every one of the 23 periods under consideration . The top performer in each period received a score of 100 , meaning that it whipped 100% of its competitors ; a fund that topped 83% of its peers got an 83 , and so on . Morningstar then averaged the percentile rankings for the 23 periods . Our 10 champs , profiled below , are the funds with the highest average consistency score in each category . ( We disqualified specialty or sector funds , because their narrow focus makes them too vulnerable to steep losses . We also bypassed those closed to new investors . ) Detailed performance data for each fund appear in the table on page 46 . ( Table omitted ) STOCK FUNDS New York Venture manager Shelby Davis , 57 , scored a 93 to top our large-company value category . His approach : Defy conventional wisdom . A recent case in point has been Davis ' attraction to financial services stocks . Such shares are supposed to suffer when interest rates rise  --  and a key short-term rate has levitated 1.25 percentage points to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100-stock New York Venture ( 4.75% load ) in banks , insurance companies and federal mortgage-funding agencies such as $232 billion ( assets ) Fannie Mae . One reason : Since the vast majority of business and personal loans and credit cards carry adjustable rates these days says Davis , banks now profit when short-term rates rise . Their lending rates rise automatically , while they are slow to increase what they pay savers , widening their profit margins . Investors who love Davis ' style but loathe his fund 's load should note that he now applies his contrarian principles to Selected American Shares , a $430 million no-load that he began managing last year . Runners-up to New York Venture among large-company value funds were $528 million Phoenix Income &; Growth A ( 4.75% load ; 80 average score ) and $1.6 billion AIM Charter ( 5.5% load ; score : 75 ) . Our winner among large-company growth funds , outgaining an average of 85% of its peers , was $285 million IDEX Fund . Swollen by such giants as Citicorp , Merrill Lynch and Coca-Cola , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion . Also beefy , by the way , is the fund 's 8.5% sales load . Manager Tom Marsico , 39 , who also runs Janus Twenty ( closed to new investors ) and Janus Growth &; Income , says his strategy is to pay below-average prices for above-average growth . IDEX 's typical stock sports a price/earnings ratio of about 14 , well below that of the S &P; 500 . But the 20% average annual earnings growth rate of its stocks is about twice that of the companies in the S &P; index . To avoid a sales load , investors may want to consider $9.3 billion Janus Fund , managed by Marsico 's colleague James Craig ; it ranked third among large-company growth funds ( with an 83 score ) . The No. 2 entry was $3.8 billion IDS New Dimensions ( 5% load ) , which tallied just under 85 . Like a championship track relay team , a succession of four managers  --  Beth Terrana , Jeff Vinik , Andrew Midler and current captain Steven Kaye  --  has kept $8 billion Fidelity Growth &; Income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styles , posting a category-leading score of 92 . Indeed , Fidelity , which has the top fund in two of our six equity categories , seems to foster consistency by promoting younger fund managers after they have trained with veterans . In a true blend of value and growth styles , the 35-year-old Kaye , who has been in charge since early 1993 , loads his 250-stock fund with companies whose earnings are about to jump but whose stocks are still selling cheap . For instance , Kaye recently bought $9.1 billion Toys R Us when the stock 's P/E ratio was an unusually low 10% below that of the S &P; 500 . Kaye believes recovering foreign sales will help the discounter 's earnings grow by better than 15% annually for the next five years . Other large-company blend funds that earned high consistency scores were $450 million Founders Special ( no load ; score : 87 ) and $3.1 billion Fidelity Destiny I ( sold only through brokers , usually with an 8.25% load ; score : 86 ) . Manager Will Danoff , 34 , contends that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key to the success of $7.5 billion Fidelity Contrafund ( 3% load ) , which led all mid-size company funds with a consistency score of 92 . A recent example of his flexibility : In early 1993 , when he saw a recovering economy lifting cyclical stocks  --  those whose performance closely tracks the strength of the economy  --  Danoff had about 10% of his portfolio in shares of auto companies and other cyclicals . By June he had sliced that stake to less than 5% in the belief that Detroit 's growth spurt was over . Now he is shifting to high-growth issues . He recently had 15% of the 600-stock portfolio in technology issues like $1.5 billion Micron Technologies . Other strong finishers among midcap funds included $1.8 billion Berger 100 ( no load ; score : 91 ) and $900 million AIM Value A ( 5.5% load ; score : 90 . With a median market value of just $330 million , Twentieth Century Giftrust Investors  --  our top-ranked small-cap fund with an average score of 87  --  is a quintessential " all small " portfolio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains and sometimes vertiginous volatility . For example , the team-managed $179 million no-load has lost 9.6% so far this year , compared with about 5.8% for the average equity fund . But in the past five years , Giftrust has gained 25.8% a year , nearly double the average equity fund 's 13.8% return . Such long-term results make it worthwhile to meet Giftrust 's requirement that any investment  --  which must be a gift to a child or other beneficiary  --  irrevocably remain in the fund for at least 10 years . Major holdings in the 60-to-80-stock portfolio recently included $150 million Roberts Pharmaceutical and $200 million Microchip Technology . Other small-cap funds that are tops for consistency are $790 million Columbia Special ( no load ; score : 81 ) and $165 million FPA Capital ( 6.5% load ; score : 79 ) . Manager Mark Holowesko , 34 , has steered $4 billion Templeton Foreign ( 5.75% maximum load ) to the top spot among international funds , notching a consistency score of 89 . Holowesko looks worldwide for beaten-down stocks that seem ready for a rebound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot region , " he says . Yet many of his choices lately have been in Europe , which he views as having the world 's best buys today . One example : $5 billion DSM , a Dutch oil company whose stock is up nearly 20% this year . ( For more on Holowesko , see Money Pro in the May issue of MONEY . ) This year , the 230-stock fund has lost just 0.4% , compared with a 2.5% loss for the average international fund . Two other foreign funds that fared well are $6.5 billion EuroPacific Growth ( 5.75% load ; score : 88 ) and $89 million GAM International ( 5% load ; score : 85 ) . BOND FUNDS It should come as no surprise that Vanguard funds top three of our four bond categories . For one thing , reliable results are an explicit goal of Ian MacKinnon , 46 , senior vice president and head of fixed-income investing for the $128 billion Valley Forge , Pa. no-load fund behemoth . Thus Vanguard 's managers do n't make major adjustments in the average maturity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e heading . Instead , they make relatively minor corrections , mainly in response to changes in the relationship between short-term and long-term rates . Vanguard 's other advantage is low expenses . Short-Term Corporate , for example , the winner in our short-term category with a score of 86 , charges just 0.26% of assets a year for expenses , compared with about 0.75% for a typical short-termer . That smaller cut means shareholders get almost half-a-percentage-point head start on the competition . Moreover , says MacKinnon , " with our low costs , we do not have to go shopping for yields . " And that lets Vanguard steer clear of derivatives  --  the high-paying but risky securities that funds with higher expenses sometimes buy to beef up their payouts ( see page 26 ) . For his part , MacKinnon thinks the short-term corporate fund , which he co-manages with Robert Auwaerter , 38 , is the best place for bond investors right now . " You are getting relatively low risk from rising interest rates and a yield of 6.25% , " he says . Other short-term-bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion Scudder Short-Term Bond ( no load ; score : 77 ) and $43 million Smith Barney Income Return A ( 1.5% load ; score : 60 ) . More than most of our 10 top funds , Vanguard Long-Term Corporate benefited from prevailing market conditions during our test period . Beginning in 1986 , interest rates on long-term Treasuries dropped from above 9% to just below 6% , before turning back up to 7.5% recently . ( As bond yields fall , prices of previously issued bonds rise ; and the longer the maturity , the bigger the boost . ) Vanguard 's steady-as-she-goes approach and low costs gave it a category-leading consistency score of 89 . Other strong finishers among long-term-bond funds include $112 Million FPA New Income ( 4.5% load ; score : 88 ) and 4.5%-load , $110 million UST Master Managed Income ( 4.5% load ; score : 83 ) . In addition to reacting to interest rates , mortgage-backed bond prices move in a complicated dance of expectations about how fast homeowners will refinance their old loans ( and cut bondholders ' yield ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . The $6.1 billion Vanguard GNMA ( with a recent yield of 6.97% ) led all mortgage funds with a score of 89 . Other mortgage funds that stood out included $260 million Princor Government Securities Income ( 5% load ; score : 86 ) and $1 billion Benham GNMA Income ( no load ; score : 84 ) . After losing 10.2% in 1990 , junk bond prices have snapped back with gains of 37% , 18% and 19% in the past three years . Leading this parade was $900 million Merrill Lynch Corporate High Income A ( 4% load ) , which has rung up a consistency score of 85 . Manager Vincent Lathbury , 53 , who has run the fund since 1982 , specializes in buying moribund bonds ( call ' em moribonds ) that have a knack for springing back to life . Other high-yield funds that placed well in our consistency ratings include $560 million AIM High Yield A ( 4.75% load ; score : 83 ) and $430 million Liberty High-Income Bond A ( 4.5% load ; score : 79 ) . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winner too . <p>
