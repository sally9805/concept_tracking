<p> Dave Wannstedt has only been a head coach for four games , but he learned coachspeak a long time ago . <p> So as his Chicago Bears go into Philadelphia to play the 4-0 Eagles , the former defensive coordinator of the Cowboys says he 's more concerned about facing Bubby Brister than he would be if he was going against Randall Cunningham , who broke his leg last week . <p> " When I was with Dallas , we played Philadelphia twice each year , and we developed a good feel for Cunningham 's strengths and weaknesses , " Wannstedt says . " We do n't know that much about Bubby Brister , and that will be a concern . " <p> It 's more a concern for Rich Kotite and the Eagles . <p> Brister was fine last week , relieving Cunningham and playing a big role in the Eagles ' comeback from a 21-0 deficit to a 35-30 win over the Jets . He finished 11 of 16 for 108 yards and a touchdown . <p> But that happens often - a backup comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second week who injured his knee against the Jets . He 'll be replaced by rookie Victor Bailey , who sees this as his opportunity . <p> " The intensity level is definitely jumping , " he says . " Guys are out there trying to pay for these cars and these houses and make a name for themselves later on . So you have to watch out . " <p> Brister , of course , is no rookie . <p> He was Pittsburgh 's starter until Joe Walton became offensive coordinator and instituted an offensive system that Brister thought was written in Greek . <p> But he 's more important than Jim McMahon was two years ago - without Reggie White , the Eagles depend more on offense than they did in 1991 , when Cunningham missed the entire season with a knee injury and the defense carried them to a 10-6 record . <p> The Bears , meanwhile , are 2-2 and suddenly in contention in the NFC Central , where the winner may need to go no better than 8-8 . They went from 47 points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was good enough to win 6-0 against an offense that had been piling up points . <p> " To get a shutout against any team is tough , " Wannstedt says . " But to have to do it to win a game is an added accomplishment . There is pressure on every play and it was great to see the team respond that way . " <p> In other games Sunday , Cincinnati is at Kansas City ; Dallas is at Indianapolis ; Miami is at Cleveland ; the New York Giants are at Washington ; Tampa Bay is at Minnesota ; San Diego is at Pittsburgh ; New England is at Phoenix ; the New York Jets are at the Los Angeles Raiders ; and Denver is at Green Bay . Houston is at Buffalo on Monday night . The NFC West is off , along with Detroit and Seattle . <p> Houston ( 1-3 ) at Buffalo ( 3-1 ) ( Monday night ) <p> A return to the scene of the crime for the Oilers , whose slide began in the third quarter of their playoff game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35-3 lead that they eventually blew in a 41-38 loss . <p> That led to owner Bud Adams firing defensive coordinator Jim Eddy , hiring Buddy Ryan , and wrenching the team apart . That 's one reason Houston has just one win . <p> " We certainly have n't done much since then to get our confidence back , " acknowledges coach Jack Pardee . <p> The Oilers have tried to regroup during their week off : Pardee got the obligatory vote of confidence from Adams . And Warren Moon , who is at the bottom of the quarterback ratings , has tried to unify the team by shifting the blame to himself . <p> Jim Kelly 's been having problems in Buffalo , too , although he got things together long enough to lead the drive that beat the Giants 17-14 last Sunday night . <p> Miami ( 3-1 ) at Cleveland ( 3-1 ) <p> An interesting test , particularly for the Browns , who got a week off after their loss in Indianapolis two weeks ago . And a nice little twist on the Miami connection - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's musical quarterbacks , both played their college football there . <p> Kosar is starting , with a $ 27 million , seven-year contract in his pocket . His teammates do n't mind . <p> " I know it was n't BK 's fault , " says wide receiver Mark Carrier . " He was n't the one jumping offsides . He was n't the one in motion illegally . We just were shooting ourselves in the foot . " <p> Miami could be prone for an upset . The Dolphins are coming off two high-profile wins : one in Buffalo , the other Monday night over Washington . <p> But they control the AFC East and maybe the AFC . And Don Shula , three wins away from tying George Halas ' career record , does n't tolerate letdowns . <p> New York Giants ( 3-1 ) at Washington ( 1-3 ) <p> A must for the banged-up Redskins , which is why Richie Petitbon was trying to get Mark Rypien back into shape earlier than expected . In last week 's 17-10 loss in Miami , neither Cary Conklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry the Skins . <p> The Giants lost last week in Buffalo , 17-14 , but the game demonstrated they belong on a level with the playoff contenders . Rodney Hampton , on a pace to set a record for carries in a season hurt his leg ( inevitably ) but his backups , Lewis Tillman and Dave Meggett , are capable . <p> Playing at home will help the Skins , but not as much as with most teams - the Giants have won six of the last eight non-strike games at RFK , even last year under Ray Handley . <p> New York Jets ( 2-2 ) at Los Angeles Raiders ( 2-2 ) <p> The season could turn here for both teams in the Ronnie Lott reunion game ( OK , he played only two seasons at the Coliseum . ) <p> The Jets were devastated after blowing a 21-0 lead at home to the Eagles , and the fourth quarter was Boomer Esiason 's first bad one as a Jet . They also lost center Jim Sweeney in that game , and the offensive line is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Raiders have their own injury problems , specifically at quarterback . They hope Jeff Hostetler can play instead of Vince Evans , who is venerable but long past his best days , which were n't that good to begin with . <p> San Diego ( 2-2 ) at Pittsburgh ( 2-2 ) <p> Yet another season-turning game and another quarterback controversy : Stan Humphries vs . John Friesz for the Chargers . <p> The Steelers , awful in their first two games , were coming on when they hit the bye week . That gave Neil O'Donnell 's arm more time to heal and Rod Woodson time to make his debut as a television analyst . <p> The Chargers were shocked in Seattle by the 31 points scored by the hitherto punchless Seahawks against their hitherto tough defense . This one should be low scoring - look for kickers , John Carney and Gary Anderson to play a major role . <p> Denver ( 3-1 ) at Green Bay ( 1-3 ) <p> Yet another team in a must-win game : the Packers , who expected to be 3-1 here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bounce here or there , our record would be better , " says coach Mike Holmgren , whose team lost in the final minute to Philadelphia and Minnesota before getting beaten 36-14 in Dallas . <p> Two disappointments have been Brett Favre and Reggie White . Favre 's having problems after his first good season and White had been double- and triple-teamed during the holdout of Tony Bennett , the other premier pass-rusher . <p> The Broncos have more trouble on the road than at home . But there 's a match here : the Packers are vulnerable in the final minute and John Elway pulls four or five games a year out just before the gun . <p> Cincinnati ( 0-4 ) at Kansas City ( 3-1 ) <p> This apparently will be Joe Montana 's alternate week off . And although Marty Schottenheimer wo n't come right out and say it , why risk his hamstring against the Bengals ? <p> Much is being made of the status of the " savior " in Kansas City . <p> " How much Joe Montana will play for us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general manager Carl Peterson . " We hope a great deal . But we ca n't control that , as we ca n't control how much Marcus Allen or Neil Smith or anybody else might play . " <p> Cincinnati will bring back David Klingler as the quarterback after some tutoring on toughness from coach David Shula during the off-week . <p> " He 's had a good work ethic , " Shula says . " But he was more enthused about things and showed he 's got that competitiveness that we see him exhibit as he 's playing . " <p> Dallas ( 2-2 ) at Indianapolis ( 2-2 ) <p> There 's quite a difference between these 2-2 teams . The Cowboys are coming off a 36-14 win over Green Bay ; the Colts off a 35-13 loss in Denver . <p> But there 's a similarity at quarterback . Jeff George , No. 1 overall pick in the 1990 draft , will probably make his first start of the season for the Colts , against Troy Aikman , No. 1 overall in 1989 . <p> The only question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36 days , is the hand he hurt when he came in at the end the beating in Denver . Aikman 's banged up , but it 's the shoulder and ribs on the left side and does n't affect his throwing . <p> Tampa Bay ( 1-3 ) at Minnesota ( 2-2 ) <p> Just when they looked like they would n't win a game all year , the Bucs smote the confused Lions , who ca n't figure who 's the quarterback . The Bucs seem to have theirs : Craig Erickson , who 's starting to look like he did in college before he got hurt . <p> The Vikings have scored just four touchdowns all season and questions are starting about Jim McMahon . <p> " Jim 's our starting quarterback , " says Dennis Green . " His performance is a lot like the team 's . It 's not been real consistent . We have n't hit it just right , but I think we will . " <p> New England ( 0-4 ) at Phoenix ( 1-3 ) <p> It probably wo n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and almost always beat them in his previous incarnation . The Patriots ' two losses at home have been by a total of six points ; their two road losses by a total of 62 . <p> The Cards are in a different category . None of their four games has been decided by more than a touchdown . But this is still a
