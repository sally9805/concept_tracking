<p> United Parcel Service and its striking workers announced a tentative contract agreement last night , signaling an end to one of the country 's biggest and most costly labor walkouts in more than a decade . <p> Officials with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters hailed the settlement as a big victory for labor . UPS agreed to create 10,000 new full-time jobs , give raises to full- time and part-time workers and allow its workers to continue receiving pensions and benefits from a series of multi-employer funds run by the union . <p> In exchange , Teamsters negotiators agreed to a five-year contract , longer than they wanted . They also apparently agreed that some of the 10,000 new full-time jobs would fall under a new pay scale that is slightly lower than what current full-time workers receive . <p> Although the contract must be ratified by the 185,000 striking UPS workers , employees are expected back on the job as early as tomorrow . <p> " In virtually every area , this agreement is much better than what was on the table before the strike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union news conference that came after more than 80 hours of round-the-clock negotiations . " This sends a signal that American workers are on the move again . After 15 years of taking it on the chin , working families are telling corporate America that we will fight for our rights . " <p> Strikers at UPS ' Oakland facility were jubilant last night . Union officials sent pickets home to celebrate , even though the strike was not officially over . <p> " It 'll be approved . I guarantee it , " said Randy Stanley , a Berkeley Teamster . " People have been out here too long . " <p> The settlement came after four days of intense negotiations that were overseen by U.S. Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman . <p> Word of the settlement trickled out yesterday afternoon . Herman scheduled a 7:45 p.m. news conference with both UPS and the Teamsters to announce the pact , but then postponed it for about two hours as the settlement nearly unraveled over a dispute between the two sides over the wording of items on which they had verbally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a win for both sides . <p> " Today 's agreement represents their hard work and determination to reconcile their differences for the good of the company , its employees and the customers they serve , " Clinton said . <p> UPS , which lost an estimated $ 300 million a week from the strike , declined to comment on details of the settlement . <p> " We realize our customers suffered many inconveniences , and we want to assure them our great service will be available to them very soon , " UPS chief negotiator Dave Murray said while standing at Herman 's side . <p> " We will encourage our members to get out there and get those customers back , " Carey added . <p> According to the Teamsters , the tentative settlement includes the following points : <p> * The creation of 10,000 new full-time jobs . That 's the number that had been sought by the union , while UPS , which employs 338,000 altogether , initially offered only 1,000 new full-time jobs . <p> * UPS ' continued participation in the Teamsters ' multi-employer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new UPS-only pension plan  --  a change that had been sought by UPS management . <p> * Pay raises of $ 3.10 per hour for full-time workers and $ 4.10 per hour for part-time workers , who currently average $ 11 per hour , over five years . <p> * A raise in starting pay for part-timers , from the current $ 8 per hour to $ 8.50 . <p> * Creation of a new full-time pay scale of $ 15 per hour that will cover many of the 10,000 new positions . That 's less than the $ 20 per hour that most full-time UPS workers currently make . <p> " To get where we had to be  --  with the creation of good full-time jobs , secure pensions , and a substantial increase in pay rates  --  we had to ( accept ) a five-year contract period , " Carey said . " I would have preferred a three-year or four- year contract , but that 's what it took . " <p> As news of the tentative settlement filtered out last night , about two dozen Teamster pickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to pick up news . <p> " At this point I 'm just ready to go back in , " said Latrice Jones , a part-time package loader who lives in Hayward and supports three children with her five-hour-a-night job . <p> UPS drivers and package handlers walked off the job August 4 over two main issues  --  union efforts to improve the lot of the company 's large part-time workforce , and company efforts to withdraw from multi-employer pension and benefits plans run by the Teamsters plans and set up its own , UPS-only plan . <p> UPS , the world 's largest package delivery firm , saw its daily deliveries plummet from 12 million to 1 million during the strike . Thousands of small businesses that rely on UPS found themselves stranded and scrambling for alternatives . Some UPS customers even laid off workers because of the strike . <p> " It 's hurting us bad right now , because we 're people who live paycheck to paycheck , " said Margie Rosario , whose husband was laid off from a San Carlos plumbing supply company because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely , but we 're getting to a point where keeping food on the table is difficult . " <p> Yesterday 's tentative settlement is n't the final word on the UPS dispute . <p> The UPS board of directors is scheduled to hold a meeting later this week that is likely to focus on the contract . <p> And Carey must brief local leaders and then put the contract to a national vote by mail  --  a process that could take a month . <p> But union officials said that , unless anything unexpected happened to scuttle the deal , UPS ' familiar brown delivery trucks could be back on the roads within two or three days . <p> " If both sides agree , they could start calling us back to work as early as Thursday or Friday , " said Jack Bookter , secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 278 in San Francisco . " They 'll be doing a lot of pickups Thursday and Friday , since a lot of customers have been saving stuff up . It 'll be real hectic for a few days , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a former UPS driver whose father was also a UPS driver , had spent several years gearing up to bargain over the part-time worker issue . Six out of 10 UPS workers today are part-timers , who have n't gotten a raise since 1982 and who earn $ 11 an hour on average , compared to $ 20 an hour for most full-timers . <p> The company said it wanted to withdraw from the multi-employer pension plan because it was subsidizing other companies . It said its workers would get a better deal by shifting into UPS-only pension and benefit plans . <p> But Teamsters officials argued that losing UPS would destabilize its multi-employer plans and would make it easier for UPS to pare benefits in the future . <p> Political analysts said yesterday that the Teamsters clearly managed to gain the upper hand in the 15-day strike  --  inflicting economic losses of $ 200 million to $ 300 million a week on the company and garnering much broader public support than other big strikes in recent history . <p> " The union very skillfully undertook a PR offensive , exploiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Bill Schneider , a political analyst with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington . " I do n't think it was that people suddenly became champions of unions , but people were sympathetic with the workers . Everyone knows and likes their UPS worker , who does hard , often unpleasant work , and brings people goodies . " <p> DETAILS OF TENTATIVE UPS CONTRACT <p> . <p> According to Teamsters President Ron Carey : <p> . <p> * Life of contract : Five years . Carey said he would have preferred a three- or four-year contract . <p> * Wages : Full-timers will receive an increase of $ 3.10 per hour over five years ; part-timers will receive an increase of $ 4.10 per hour . Starting part-time wages goes from $ 8 per hour to $ 8.50 . <p> * Part-time jobs : The company agreed to create 10,000 new full- time jobs over five years . The union had sought 10,000 ; the company had offered 1,000 . <p> * Pension plan : UPS employees will continue to be covered by a multi-employer plan run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan and set up a UPS-only plan . <p> * Safety : UPS agreed to negotiate with the union to find a safe way to increase package-weight limits UPS employees handle .
