<p> Everything I know I learned from television . <p> My sense of myself , my world , my desires , even my language , comes from , like , you know , television . I measure time not by cycles of day and night , but by half-hours and hours . My year divides not by months but by sweeps . <p> I studied Feminism 101 with Mary Richards , did my postdoctoral feminist training with Roseanne . I learned to perceive the world as a dangerous place from Rod Serling , Chris Carter , the psychos on ' Hill Street Blues ' and the bedtime news . <p> I learned , after doing rounds at St. Eligius and Cook County General , that doctors simply have too many personal crises going on to focus on patients . <p> I know that , if a young lady in heels takes the short cut through the woods on a stormy night , there is a killer on the loose . <p> I know Saturday morning is for overstimulation . I know thinner is better , per Richard Simmons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , from ' Family Ties ' through ' Touched by an Angel , ' that I should value family and friendship above all , except maybe the ability to get my whites whiter . <p> My understanding of science , first tutored by Mr. Wizard , went hip-hop with Bill Nye . My appreciation of logos and themes dates to the CBS eye and the NBC chimes . My fashion sense evolved from Gidget to Mrs. Emma Peale , accessorized by MTV and imprinted by Nike . ( When did commercials take over my clothes closet ? ) <p> It only feels like I 've been watching TV for a millennium . Actually , I left the house twice last week and was n't involved in a single car chase . <p> TV is a great window on the world , even if we rarely see ourselves there . In my years as TV critic for The Post , I 've learned that TV 's version of reality is less important than TV 's ability to bring us together to share a reality . <p> Pick a reality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Beatles on ' Ed Sullivan ' - are not real , personal experiences . The sharing with 30 million others , not the thing itself , gives those moments resonance . Marshall McLuhan got the message . So did ' The Truman Show . ' <p> TV is funny and serious , shallow and deep , on and off - but mostly on . Among the things I 've learned from television : <p> I wave , therefore I am . <p> TV offers evidence of our very existence ; witness the network morning shows , where tourists stand in the cold , holding signs and waving madly . Witness the volunteers eager to get on ' Jerry Springer . ' Anyone desperate enough for notice can be noticed by television . <p> Reality we 've got , romance we need . <p> I understand love and marriage , thanks to television . Love and marriage are what ' Mad About You ' had that made it unfunny , while rocky romance is what kept ' Moonlighting ' and ' Cheers ' hot . Marriage ( with children ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that love and marriage are dreary , hard work , while rocky romance is exciting and fun . We get the distinction : Love is what Ally McBeal may think she wants but romance is what she 's after . <p> We 've learned a lot about human nature and relationships from the tube . It 's obvious that , if three young men share an apartment while they recover from divorce or try to get a job , at least one of them will turn out to be gay . <p> We know that , when a divorced <p> dad and a divorced mom meet <p> they will behave like overheated teenagers , prompting their offspring to make wise remarks and act more maturely than their parents . And when a coed bunch of roommates shares a flat , it wo n't matter if anyone has a job because they 'll spend most of their waking hours in deeply superficial introspection at the local coffeehouse . <p> Love of country . <p> TV instills in us a firm picture of what it means to be an American , starting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a holy day ( the orthodox observe the whole weekend ) with rousing theme music , red , white and blue graphics , and a gathering of the tribe , often chanting and wearing face paint . Similarly , the Olympics are a couple of xenophobic weeks during which the networks grudgingly acknowledge there are people from other places - often with unpronounceable names - out there sweating , too . <p> More thoughtful patriots turn to ' MASH , ' where American team spirit and high ideals still make us laugh and cry . <p> Live coverage unto death : <p> TV is not just cradle-to-grave , it 's wall-to-wall , thanks to the cable news channels . Starsky needed Hutch , Laverne needed Shirley , so MSNBC needed Monica , O.J. and JonBenet to fill the void . Nature abhors a vacuum ; TV abhors post-cold war tranquility . <p> The importance of major life passages like weddings and funerals is taught by television , normally in the context of royals , either British or Kennedy . We gather for milestones , often knowing better , and marvel at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an all-Kennedy , all-the-time cable channel , I can not say . ) <p> TV teaches by omission , too . The tube lets us know when to worry : A story about 10 people killed in a London bomb blast is more important than 10,000 killed in a flood in India . I hear America singing . <p> My views of the American West were shaped by ' Bonanza , ' ' Gunsmoke ' and ' Little House on the Prairie ' while my ideas about cosmopolitan life in the East were formed in Lucy and Ricky 's apartment , ' Make Room for Daddy 's ' duplex and ' That Girl 's ' flat . I 'm still rooting for Lucy to get out of the house and down to the club . <p> I know more about the Psychic Friends Network than anyone who got sufficient sleep through the ' 80s . <p> I know modern history is TV history , a succession of mass Nielsen gatherings , Archie Bunker through the Berlin Wall . We are rewarded for caring : ' Who Shot J.R. ? ' is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we 've been paying attention , we 're in on the joke . Just as Rather , Brokaw and Jennings have ushered us through many election nights , the recycling of Jane Pauley on MSNBC assures us there is continuity to American life . <p> TV makes life user-friendly . <p> From Neil Armstrong 's walk on the moon to the vivid pictures from Mars , there is nothing that TV ca n't make ordinary . Seen on TV , the Mars photos are just another remote feed . When television gets up close and personal with anything , even profound concepts , they become oddly familiar and flat . Juxtaposing Joseph Campbell and a pitch for PBS pledges , or a live birth and a baseball game , TV is the great leveler . <p> I know the Challenger explosion by heart , not that I understand it , but I have the billowy smoke image on file in my mental hard drive . If you were n't around when TV explained that this shook America to its foundations , you ca n't see it as profound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hilarity . <p> A word causes a near-revolution when televised one year , then passes into common TV currency . Ultimately , it loses all meaning . ' That sucks ! ' a TV child chirped on ' Uncle Buck , ' a forgettable 1990 sitcom . After an uproar , the word spread around the dial . Now TV grownups use it , too . In the past Rowan &; Martin blushed over ' you bet your sweet bippy ' ; nowadays , Beavis and Butt-head feel free to show us their bippies . <p> Silly TV expressions define our times . ' Nanu , nanu , ' ' Stifle yourself ! ' ' Dy-no-mite ! ' Some carry the weight of a decade : ' Hi , honey , I 'm home ! ' Like it or not , the lingo connects us . ' Is that your final answer ? ' <p> After a millennium in front of the idiot box , give or take , even casual watchers can feel a shift in the way TV networks think about greed . Greed used to be the somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proud title of a prime-time network game show . They 've got our number , we 've got theirs . <p> You do n't have to be a professional TV watcher to be acculturated this way . <p> A Martian , if placed in a screening room for several hours and given a short course in TV history , would learn enough about human sexuality to pass , if not as a human , then at least as a couch potato . He would note that , while Lucy and Ricky slept in single beds and were not allowed to utter the word ' pregnant , ' human evolution now favors cameras in delivery rooms and blow-by-blow descriptions of Phoebe 's surrogate motherhood for Ross ' former wife and her lesbian partner . <p> ' Teacher , mother , secret lover ! ' - Homer Simpson addressing his TV . <p> Future anthropologists will conclude that television at the millennium provided solace and predictability . We can count on death , taxes and cartoon logic . A character flattened by a falling anvil will pop back into shape in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The Simpsons , ' where the joke will be on the self-appointed anti-TV-violence crusaders . <p> Commentators of the future also will say TV in the 20th century provided continuity amid technological upheaval . I may have a slow modem and wimpy RAM , but I know my way around the remote control . Computers may talk , the remote may send e-mail , but at the end of the day , which contraption casts just the right blue glow for Chinese takeout ? <p> ( Note to future historians : Stone Phillips only appeared to be animatronic . ) <p> Certain television truths are self-evident . <p> Splashy Vegas magic acts play inexplicably well on TV , even though we know not to trust the camera when it comes to sleight of hand . We also accept that national political candidates will win or lose based on their TV charms , and that an entire season of ' Dallas ' was a dream . <p> We know cliffhangers will be resolved in February , May or November . We know local ' news ' reports about tangentially related subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , television adds 10 pounds to your lips . <p> TV truths are as reliable as laugh tracks , understood by few but trusted by many . <p> I learned from a millennium 's exposure to the tube , give or take , that selling is entertaining . And vice versa . Money makes the world go around , advertising is a respected American art form , a political method , a way or romance , even a form of worship . It 's OK to covet the new Lexus and dance a jig over a flavor of gum . That 's all part of belonging . Selling is programming , programming is selling . I learned from TV that the ads can be funnier than the shows ( early Volkswagen , Alka-Seltzer ) and oddly racier ( Bob Dole on his particular dysfunction ) . I learned that the reason domestic comedies are n't set in conditions of poverty is that the sponsors want to sell the idea of a well-appointed modern kitchen . <p> I know that , if the networks think one Joey Buttafuoco or Jesus movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I know that , when a cluster of happy children begin to sing alongside an inane purple dinosaur , it 's best to run from the room . <p> I know that , when I seek a quiet , meditative state of mind , that 's the time the theme from ' The Patty Duke Show ' will persist in my head . <p> I know that nothing can touch the memory of Carol Burnett doing Scarlett O'Hara with the curtain rod on her shoulders . Unless it was the ' Chuckles the Clown ' episode of the ' Mary Tyler Moore Show . ' <p> I know there are too many programs on too many channels to keep track of ; I know that it 's occasionally worth trying because , in the end , the sharing 's the thing .
