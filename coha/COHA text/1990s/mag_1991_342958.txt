Another full-fledged war began last week , complete with its own heavy weapons , intelligence reports and international team of experts on strategy and tactics . This one was against an enemy no less redoubtable than Saddam 's army : an oil slick estimated at 80 km ( 50 miles ) long and 19 km ( 12 miles ) wide that is breaking into pieces as it spreads down the Persian Gulf , its consistency like that of melted chocolate . <P> An estimated 1.1 billion liters ( 294 million gal. ) of crude oil had escaped from Kuwait 's Sea Island terminal before allied bombing raids on pumps feeding the facility reduced the torrent to a trickle . That makes the spill by far the largest ever , not 12 times the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster , as originally thought , but 27 times as large . And that does not include oil that began gushing last week from a second spill farther north . The magnitude of the mess is such that " it ca n't be cleaned up , " says Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based in Houston . <P> Saddam Hussein may have engineered the spill to foil any allied plans for an amphibious invasion , but he was also probably trying to shut down seaside desalination plants that provide much of the fresh water for Saudi Arabia 's Eastern province . Another target may have been Saudi power stations and oil refineries , which rely on seawater for cooling . Saddam 's action will not prevent an invasion , says the Pentagon , but temporary shutdowns of plants and refineries seem inevitable . <P> The danger is vastly greater , though , for the billions of creatures that inhabit the Persian Gulf . The gulf waters , shores and islands are dotted with coral reefs , mangrove swamps and beds of sea grass and algae , brimming with birds , sea turtles , fish and marine mammals . This complex ecosystem , already pushed to the limits of survival by years of pollution , is now threatened with total collapse by the inexorable spread of the smothering , toxic oil . <P> Early on , experts might have blunted the slick 's destructive power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispersants to break it up and removing more with surface-skimming devices deployed from boats . But the best they could hope for in a war zone was to protect a few key spots . " We learned in the Exxon Valdez cleanup that you ca n't control the oil but you can exclude it from a small area , " says Randy Bayliss , a consultant involved in the Alaskan effort . <P> Workers last week began placing miles of plastic booms around the desalination facilities . Because petroleum generally floats on water , such booms , which extend up to 1 m ( 3 ft. ) below the surface , can contain a slick . The next step is to put skimming equipment inside the booms and begin scooping up the oil , either with vacuuming devices or by drawing oil-absorbent plastic ropes through it and wringing them out . Some of the crude can be salvaged as kerosene . <P> Such techniques work best during the early days of a spill , before the crude begins to separate . Unfortunately , by the time a U.S. oil-spill assessment team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oil had evaporated , leaving heavier chemicals that were whipped by waves into a thick water-oil " mousse " or turned into tar balls , which sink .
