<p> Supporters and opponents of President Clinton 's deficit-reduction plan have made claims and counterclaims about what the plan will or will not do . <p> In basic terms , what the bill will do , over five years , in 1993 dollars , is lower the annual deficits by $ 496 billion . Of that , $ 241 billion will come from tax increases and $ 255 billion from spending cuts . <p> Here are some of the claims and the facts behind them . <p> Claim No. 1 : Retroactive tax increases have never been approved before , and they are unconstitutional , say Republicans . <p> Retroactive tax increases are commonplace . The income tax increase just enacted , along with a rise in taxes on estates in excess of $ 2.5 million , will be retroactive to Jan. 1 , 1993 . <p> However , wealthy taxpayers will have an extra two years to pay the additional income taxes . <p> Congress has raised taxes retroactively at least 26 times , according to the Treasury Department . The increases sometimes have been supported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax reform act pushed through by Republican President Reagan . <p> Income tax rates alone were increased retroactively twice during the 1980s under Reagan . <p> But Democratic presidents have done it , too . The most notable such increase was President Johnson 's surtax , imposed in 1968 , to help pay for the Vietnam War . The law was passed on Oct. 22 , and the tax was retroactive to Jan. 1 for corporations and April 1 for individuals . <p> The constitutionality of retroactive rate increases was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1981 . <p> Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole , R-Kan. , a major opponent of Clinton 's plan , has backed retroactive changes in the past , including a 1982 increase that subjected more unemployment benefits to taxation . He was wrong when he said , " " Never before in American history has the government increased tax rates retroactively . " <p> Claim No. 2 : The budget is the largest deficit reduction in history , says Clinton . <p> Claim No. 3 : The budget is the largest tax increase in world history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for inflation , this year 's budget is neither one nor the other . <p> The budget agreement that Democrats in Congress developed and President Bush signed in 1990 contained $ 482 billion in deficit reduction  --  higher taxes and lower spending . Adjusted for inflation , that plan , some of which is still in effect , was worth $ 532 billion in 1993 dollars . That compares with $ 496 billion in Clinton 's plan in 1993 dollars . <p> As for taxes , the 1982 law enacted under Reagan raised taxes by $ 215 billion over five years , which amounts to $ 286 billion in 1993 dollars , considerably more than this year 's figure of $ 241 billion . <p> Claim No. 4 : There will be no income tax increase on working families earning less than $ 180,000 , Clinton says . <p> That is not precisely correct , and if the president had not used the phrase " " working families , " his statement would be further from the truth because some retirees face income tax increases . <p> Under the budget , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of over $ 140,000 . Taxable income is what is left after deductions , and personal exemptions are subtracted from adjusted gross income . As a rule of thumb , a couple with a taxable income of $ 140,000 probably has a total income of about $ 180,000 . <p> But some surely have an income below that , accountants say . <p> As for retirees , more than 5 million of them with annual incomes as low as $ 34,000 ( counting half their Social Security benefits ) will see their income taxes increase because they will be taxed on up to 85 percent of their Social Security payments , from 50 percent . <p> And even the " " working families " phrase does not cover the thousands of cases in which one spouse works and the other is retired or disabled and receives Social Security benefits . <p> Claim No. 5 : Most Americans will feel a lot of financial pain . <p> This is a popular misconception , polls indicate . <p> In fact , most Americans will not feel a lot of pain , although everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hit the rich hardest , direct hits on the wealthy inevitably also affect other Americans indirectly . <p> But two features of the plan will hit lower- and middle-income Americans directly : the new gasoline tax and the expansion of the Social Security tax on higher-income retirees . <p> The increase in gasoline tax of 4.3 cents per gallon is expected to raise about $ 23 billion . For the average family of four , the cost should come to about $ 50 a year , although suburbanites and Westerners , because they drive more , will pay more . <p> The government hopes to raise $ 25 billion over the next five years by expanding Social Security benefits that can be taxed , and retirees with decidedly middle-class incomes will be affected . <p> Clinton was accurate , according to most official and private estimates , when he asserted that 80 percent of the higher taxes would be paid by taxpayers with incomes above $ 200,000 and 90 percent by those with incomes above $ 100,000 . <p> Claim No. 6 : The national debt will continue to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans agree on this one , but they phrase it differently . The national debt is the accumulation of all annual deficits over the years . With the deficit-cutting in the Clinton plan , the deficit will grow by $ 1 trillion in the next five years . If the plan had not become law , it would have grown by $ 1.5 trillion . Clinton likes to point out that he will cut down on the deficit by half a trillion dollars ; Dole likes to point out that under the Clinton plan the national debt will grow by a trillion dollars . If projections are reliable , they are both correct . <p> Claim No. 7 : With the budget in place , the economy will create 8 million jobs over the next four years , Clinton says . <p> That 's a prediction that is impossible to prove either way . <p> However , most public and private economists agree that the job growth is likely to happen with the Clinton deficit-reduction plan in place . But , they add , it would have happened without the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending cuts are not conducive to job creation . <p> Republicans predict the plan will create a recession , but economists tend to disagree with that , although they do agree that economic growth will be slowed . On the other hand , Clinton 's proposal of the plan , in part , has led to a decline in interest rates , and that means that many more Americans may be in a better position to save money and thus be in a position to spend more . <p> Claim No. 8 : The Clinton plan will cost 1 million jobs in the next four years , Dole says . <p> Before the plan was announced , the Congressional Budget Office projected about 9 million new jobs over the next four years . <p> When Clinton predicted that 8 million jobs would be created , Dole seized on the two figures as a sign that a million jobs would be lost . CBO officials say that is a misinterpretation of the data . <p> Clinton is relying on the average of three private forecasts that were made more recently than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 800,000 small businesses will owe higher taxes , Dole says . <p> That is probably true , but it lacks perspective . The business owners with higher taxes represent less than 4 percent of the 21 million taxpayers who report business income . Many more small businesses will have their taxes cut than will have them raised under the legislation . <p> Claim No.10 : Many small business organizations , including the National Association of the Self Employed and the National Venture Capital Association , backed the Clinton plan , Clinton says . <p> Most business groups opposed the legislation , including the National Federation of Independent Businessmen , the largest association of small businesses . <p> Claim No. 11 : About 80 percent of the spending reductions in the bill will come after the 1996 election , says Dole . <p> Dole was making a good point but exaggerating the numbers . <p> The plan is backloaded . Most of the spending cuts in the five-year plan will come in the fiscal year 1997 , which begins Oct. 1 , 1996 , or in the fiscal year 1998 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending cuts is 61 percent in the last two years if lower interest payments are counted as a spending reduction and 53 percent if they are not , Senate Budget Committee calculations show . <p> NOTES : Compiled from the New York Times , Newsday and Reuters .
