<p> BERRIEN SPRINGS , Mich.  --  On a blustery day , a man slowly emerges from his farmhouse , the soft white stubble on his moon-shaped face gently pelted by an autumn rain . Once outside , his gait accelerates , and quite purposefully . <p> " Gon na make a comeback , " Muhammad Ali offers to me in a whisper . <p> I 've heard this pronouncement before . It is vintage Ali , a typical shock-o-gram he wants dispatched to the world to create some commotion . I 've always suspected he does this so we wo n't forget . <p> But how could we ? <p> He motions to me to follow him to a half-million-dollar custom-made boxing gym on his 100-acre farm . Inside , the walls spring to life with photographs . There 's Ali crashing a right hand off Foreman 's skull ; there he is giving Frazier the eye . Reading a Muslim newspaper with Malcolm X. . . . Barking at Cosell . . . . Standing over Liston . <p> Ali opens a closet and slips on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heavy bag and begins dancing on his toes , teeth gritted . He whaps the bag , forcing the big lug to gently swing from its mooring . When he 's finished he meets up with a speedbag . Within a few seconds , Ali 's fists have the dangling air bladder rapping in a satisfying staccato . <p> Surprisingly rhythmic with his punching , Ali punctuates the workout with a powerful , thudding right hand . <p> I check to see if he 's on his heels . <p> He is not . But I sure am . <p> He conducts this mini-workout not to show off , I surmise , but to let the world know one thing : <p> Tell them I am OK . <p> Tell them not to cry for me . <p> Tell them to help others who need it . <p> Do n't look at the man 's trembling limbs . Look into his eyes . They have not changed . For me , they speak one thing : <p> Love . Not for some of us . For all . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arena or another , commanded our attention . Here it is , 1999 , and we 're still mesmerized . Parkinson 's is no match for Ali . Even at 57 . He is a come-to-life definition of his Muslim namesake : <p> " Worthy of praise " and " Most high . " <p> And so we honor him . Muhammad Ali is USA TODAY 's Athlete of the Century . <p> Some might not agree . We understand . <p> Indeed , many superb athletes have sunk their indelible footprints on the vast sporting landscape the last 100 years . The Babe . Jesse Owens and Jackie Robinson , Jim Brown and Henry Aaron . Jim Thorpe , Wayne Gretzky , Jack Nicklaus . Babe Didrikson Zaharias and Jackie Joyner-Kersee . Willie Mays . Wilt . <p> And , of course , Michael Jordan . <p> ( For the record , Ali casts his vote not for himself but for Sugar Ray Robinson , viewed as the finest pound-for-pound pugilist ever  --  " Better than me , " Ali says . ) <p> As great as those athletes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity over four decades is unrivaled . James Anderson , a former Ali security chief , loves to tell when the champ was in Germany before fighting Richard Dunn . " We were in front of our hotel getting ready to leave for a sparring session . Ali had the window down . Two elderly German ladies were coming out of a grocery store . They saw him and started crying . Then he broke down and started crying . Soon , we were all crying . " <p> When I watched Ali unsteadily light the Olympic caldron in Atlanta in 1996 , I thought the world was going to melt in adoration . I like to think of him as the embodiment of the " A Package " : athleticism , artistry , accomplishment , alpha-star appeal and ambassadorship . He stood for something besides himself . A man who sacrificed principal to uphold his principles . A superstar who has an uncommon touch for his fellow man . <p> " Ali , Ali , Ali " we chanted . <p> I am The Greatest . <p> I am pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was . <p> He was outlandish and outrageous . Sometimes we did n't care to hear the " Louisville Lip " flap . Always , he gave more than he took . How many athletes can say that ? He humanized our perceptions of athletes , made them seem more real to us . <p> Sure , he sold us the sizzle with those tongue-in-cheek poetic diatribes directed at the Big Ugly Bear , the Rabbit , the Washerwoman , the Gorilla and the Mummy . But you know what ? The steak he delivered tasted pretty good , too , and rare it was when Ali did n't elevate the sport through words or action , like " The Thrilla in Manila " and " The Rumble in the Jungle . " <p> More often than not , he backed his boasts . First at the Rome Olympics in 1960 with a gold medal . Then the fight that put him on the fistic map : <p> Sonny Liston . <p> As Cassius Marcellus Clay in 1964 , he was a monumental underdog against the glowering champ . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sting like a bee " 22-year-old challenger began refining a couple of characteristics that would serve him well during his remarkable career : non-pareil self-promotion and the mastery of ring psychology . He taunted Liston : <p> " I predict that he will go in eight to prove that I 'm great ; and if he wants to go to heaven , I 'll get him in seven . If you want to lose your money , bet on Sonny . " <p> Ali 's speed , reflexes and strength overwhelmed the baleful ex-convict . Liston surrendered after the seventh round . He never was the same . In the rematch , he was clipped by a short right hand  --  the so-called Phantom Punch  --  and toppled to the canvas . Ali stood over him and shouted , " Get up and fight , sucker . " <p> Liston did nothing of the sort . He knew better . <p> Clay-Liston I remains one of the biggest upsets in sports history . " I was n't scared of Sonny , " Ali tells me later in his den , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We 're seated at a large , round table . Ali is working over a wad of pink bubble gum like a teenager . He reaches down and mightily lifts an 8-inch-thick stack of photographs from his life . We begin sifting through the memories . Wives , children , managers , trainers , business associates , parasites , politicians and assorted flakes and fakes . Ali was more at home with the abject poor than with his rich and famous friends . <p> Ali spies a picture of himself with the late , legendary Sam Cooke . In hushed tones , he begins singing , " Darling , you send me . " <p> By the mid- ' 60s , it would n't be long before Ali himself was jettisoned . <p> After winning the title , he spoke his mind . It was a subject mainstream America was doing its best to ignore : the plight of black America . He changed his religion . He changed his name . He raised the consciousness of his people . And though his strident views were not born of hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his personal message of freedom , justice and equality for all Americans lost in the din of dissent over his association . <p> " Countries rejoiced , " Ali says , his big eyes opening Ali-wide . " From Tunisia and Morocco to Pakistan and Turkey , Malaysia and the Philippines . ' Cassius Clay is a Muslim ! Cassius Clay is a Muslim ! ' If I had n't become a Muslim , I would n't be who I am today . " <p> In 1967 , he refused induction into the Army for the Vietnam War . Ali , citing conscientious objector status based on religious beliefs , was pilloried . The media called him Clay , a name Ali considered to have slave-master roots . Red Smith , the venerable New York Times sports columnist , labeled him a " slacker . " The government placed Ali under surveillance , and in 1968 he spent 10 days in jail for  --  get this  --  driving without a license . Death threats were common . <p> A personal stand <p> Boxing , too , turned on its favorite son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title without due process for refusing military induction and banished from the sport he so loved . Indicted , fingerprinted and photographed , harangued and ostracized by the public , Ali spent 3 1/2 years in exile from the sport . He was vindicated when the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously reversed his conviction . <p> " If I had lost my case , " he says , " I was looking at five years in jail . And I would 've sat there and done my time . I knew I was right . I had to make a stand . " <p> He did so , but at great detriment to his career . By the time he returned in 1970 to fight Jerry Quarry , Ali was not the same fighter . Time had robbed him of his incomparable legs and hair-trigger reflexes . The invincibility vanished . But his chin , and fighting heart , could not be spirited away , and Ali resurrected his aura with some of the most memorable performances in boxing history . <p> " This is the greatest event in the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and I ai n't gon na be jokin ' . I 'll be peckin ' and pokin ' and pourin ' water on his smokin ' . This might shock and amaze ' ya , but I 'll retire Joe Frazier . " <p> In his initial bid to regain the title in 1971 , he lost a 15-round decision to Frazier , the first in a trilogy of confrontations that concluded with their grueling grudge match in Manila where , as Ali says , " Frazier quit on his stool " after the 14th round . <p> " I wanted to quit , too , " he tells me . I believe him . <p> Ali would not get another crack at the crown for 3 1/2 years , against George Foreman , when Ali gave birth to invention again with his " rope-a-dope " strategy . He knocked out the frightening knockout artist and regained the heavyweight championship , something not even Jack Johnson or Joe Louis had accomplished . <p> Ali was not finished shocking us . <p> He made 10 successful title defenses in the mid-70s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional r&eacute;sum&eacute; , Leon Spinks . Seven months later , in the rematch , Ali became the first man to win boxing 's marquee title a third time . <p> He retired 20 years ago , and we cringed when he uttered the word " comeback " in 1980 . On a fall night in Las Vegas , the 38-year-old deteriorated warrior not only lost badly to his former sparring partner , Larry Holmes , he could have lost his life . Ali had been ingesting pills by the cupful each day , partly to lose weight , partly for a misdiagnosed thyroid condition . <p> Ali , of course , was fallible . In his autobiography , he admitted to slapping his first wife , Sonji , and to repeated marital indiscretions that led to four marriages . His humiliation of some fighters , particularly the race-baiting done at Frazier 's expense , was beneath him . Ali said he was only hyping his fights . <p> In the years since , he has acknowledged some of his shortcomings . He became more serious about his spirituality and spreading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to further world peace and charitable causes . He works with the Robin Hood Foundation , which feeds disadvantaged mothers . He has visited Morocco , Indonesia and the Ivory Coast for Global Village Champions , which has fed millions during catastrophic events . <p> Just last week , he traveled to Italy for an international peace conference . <p> Back home , he gets as much as he gives . The man is hopelessly spoiled , but in a good way . Wife Lonnie and a doting staff tend to nearly every whim or need . In the meantime , Ali continues to spoil us with his generosity , his enormous empathy for people . Over the years , many have taken advantage of Ali 's loving nature . They have conned him , ripped him off , abused him  --  even to this day . Ali knows who they are , but he never , ever , will say a bad word about any of them . <p> He just does n't say anything at all . <p> As Ali and I prepare to leave the gym , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He makes each of them feel special . He does his well-rehearsed magic act , pulling an orange silk from an empty palm , then appears to levitate . <p> He is the eternal little boy . We are forever his witting , grateful dupes . <p> " Would n't that be beautiful : ' Ali Coming Back , ' " he says as we leave the gym . " It 'd give the press something to write about . I 'll have new poems and predictions . It 's worth a try . " <p> Of course , there will be no comeback , not in the ring , not anywhere else . That implies he has gone somewhere . Ali is too busy being Ali for that to happen .
