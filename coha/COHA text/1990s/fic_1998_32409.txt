Prologue Dobbs ' Pantry 20 Battersea Rise Battersea , South of the Thames April , 1886 Young Jenny Dobbs , the grocer 's wife , her black merino shawl slipped down over one shoulder , stood before the upstairs window overlooking Battersea Park . Everything appeared motionless , drenched in spring sunlight and freshest green . Here , on the other side of the begrimed window , the atmosphere was fetid , seasonless , oppressive with burning tallow and the stench of sickness . For three days now , the woman in the bed behind her had maintained an inexplicable grace , inexplicable considering her history , as Jenny had heard it , had raptly listeneda steep decline from fame and beauty 's fortune to this . The emaciated figure in its linen chemise with a rich embroidery of scarlet honeysuckle about the neck and wrists , attempted sitting up . Hearing her efforts , Jenny turned from the window . A vein in the woman 's neck swelled like softest lilac cording , her chestnut hair lay pasted in thin vines around her shoulders . Her hooded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the room she was in , their once fine colour given over entirely to an expanding blackness of the pupil . Her skin 's humid whiteness suggested a root or bulb brutally brought up from its underground chambers . The bedclothes , the sheets and counterpane , held an ominous fated stillness . Pat and Jenny Dobbs ' only tenant , scarcely thirty years old , was dying of pneumonia in a cheap flat above their grocery , where a bad drain smell crept from beneath the warped flooring , and a small stove gave off a thinraveling of warmth . The woman lifted her hand in a gesture weak but nonetheless urgent . " What is it , Selene ? What is it , dear ? " The hand lapsed back upon the quilt . Jenny moved in the direction it had seemed to suggest toward a black leather trunk across the room . Raising the lid , she saw , set atop a neat stack of books , an envelope sealed with a blood bright orb of melted wax . Envelope in hand , Jenny recrossed the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when she came to the bed , it was too late to receive any living answer . Selene Cook 's face bore an expression of what could only be described as calm , cold peace . With wetted fingers , the grocer 's wife extinguished the several candles surrounding the bedside . The goldfinch in its domed cage she would carry downstairs as Miss Cook had insisteda gift . And the old-fashioned , dark blue dress she had asked to be buried inthe same dress she told Jenny she had worn in all her seancesthat needed to be prepared as well . As for relatives , there was only a sister in Kensington to be notified . What more ? The letter . As she studied the address , it occurred to Jenny to say nothing to her husband . He was a cautious , short-tempered man , and she found herself wanting , purely for her own adventure , to take the omnibus to Mornington Road and deliver poor Miss Cook 's letter herself . That would be the best thing , the thing Miss Cook no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet still awake to the possibilities of romance , Jenny Dobbs stood on the room 's threshold , the finch 's cage in one hand , the letter to Sir William Herapath in the other , regarding the silent , diminutive figure upon the bed . Fancy what a world ! Here was someone familiar with the dead , at one time famous for being so , now , within the past hour , become finally , everlastingly , one of them . THE HACKNEY SEANCES 1873 it grows worse . instructions , mischief , powers . a trembling throughout . 6 Bruce Villas , Eleanor Road Hackney , London January , 1873 Mathilde , or Tot , as she preferred to be called , took her time lighting the coal fire . The girl was face down upon the bed , still in her corset of scarlet flannel , her petticoats tangled about her , while her pet finch , freed from its domed cage sat perched in the girl 's loosened hair , regarding Tot with a fierce , indolent eye . A checked muslin gown , a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a chair Muddy black boots stood beneath them . Tot ignored the sleeping girl , grateful to be relieved of her usual morning 's routine which would have involved returning at least twice before the brat bothered to wake up and demand that Tot unlace then retighten her corset , help fasten up her teacher 's dress , comb and pin up her thick , unruly hair . Meanwhile the younger sister , Octavia , would have eaten her breakfast , memorized her bit of French and be waiting coolly beside the front door for her ride to Miss Cliff 's where she was an obedient and tractable pupil , while this other , this one , was said to be a most eccentric and bad-tempered teacher . Yesterday 's news of Selene 's dismissal from Miss Cliff 's School for Young Ladies , of the consequent loss to the Cook household of thirty pounds a year , of the forfeiture of Octavia 's education due entirely to her sister 's selfish behavior , had plummeted the family into unexpected crisis . All this , with its dread implications , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbursts of hysteria from all save Mr. Cook , who remained calm because he had known enough to stay away . Tot left a fire blazing hotly in the girl 's room . Three more days passed in this same suspension from routine . The front steps accumulated unswept snow and a treacherous sheeting of ice formed underneath . Indoors , lamp chimneys darkened with soot , vegetables sprouted waxy tendrils , furniture became lightly cloaked in dust and the culprit , Selene , continued to lay as if dead , in a fit , with Tot obliged to carry upstairs and back downstairs , platefuls of uneaten toast , while a morose Octavia plucked listlessly at what lay on her plate before locking herself back in her bedroom . Mrs. Cook launched herself about the house on opposing tides of rage and melancholy , working her hands as if they might produce something in their constant wringing to save the situation . And Mr. Cook , a man much weaker and more precarious in his health than his wife , fell ill but took himself out of the house anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Tot sprinkled wetted tea leaves over a muddy footprint on the hall carpet , preparing to whisk the whole mess back up with a handbrush , she was rapped on the head by her employer . " Tot , " Mrs. Cook loomed above her , reeking of bacon . " Go upstairs and bring Selene and Octavia down from their rooms . We are going to demand of those spirits responsible for this crisis what it is they would have us do . We are on the very brink of ruin . What , I will ask them , is to keep you from losing your employment and the rest of us from falling straight into the workhouse ? " So Tot , terrified of spirits , of devils , of ghosts , of all things that refused visibility , stood outside the girl 's bedroom , crossing herself repeatedly , until she summoned enough courage to open the door and rouse a creature whose body had become a shadowy crossroads , a meeting place for the unholy or at the very least , the unseen . Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such terror , my own name eludes me . And my familystrangers gazing at me , their eyes like barbs in my flesh . All night I was awakened by a voice calling itself Phoenicia . At her instruction , I rose from my bed and wandered over the dark house . Then she said I must go outside and wash with snow . This I did . Bathe in fire , the voice said . I feel a great iron heaviness in all my limbs . Denis Cook 's worsening grippe convinced him to quit work early and travel straight home to bed . He dreaded the mare 's nest that would no doubt greet him , but hoped the sight of his nightcap on his head and the bedcovers sealed over him at four o'clock in the afternoon would persuade his family to leave him in peace . As he stood in the foyer , knocking snow off the tops of his boots after having nearly been assassinated by a bit of ice hidden on the stoop , as he unwound the red woolen muffler from his inflamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became aware of an eerie silence . " Mrs. Cook ? Tot ? Octavia ? " He stepped gingerly , tiptoed in stockinged feet about his own house . Were they in some plural faint , poisoned or run off ? When he cracked open the double doors to the parlour , his discovery scarcely comforted him . The patterned drapes were closed tight , the room itself dark except for a coal fire in the grate by fitful light of which he saw the women of his family seated , hands clasped in a ring around the parlour table . A fourth figure , he could identify its pear-shaped bulk as Tot 's , was present as well . Whatever the women were doing in that circle , heads thrown back and eyes closed , Denis Cook felt chiefly disappointed . He had wanted Tot to prepare him his favorite horehound syrup , the usual mustard poultice for his chest . As he stood there , Selene , Octavia , even his wife of eighteen years ( whom , out of some misplaced awe , he still called Mrs. Cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest heed so rapt were they in their trance . He experienced a distinct sympathy for himself as he closed the doors upon their bizarre little tableau and made his way , throat burning as if a small hot cinder were stuck at its back , up to his bed . Halfway up the draughty stairway , he was stopped by a thump from below . As if , he thought , a heavy object ( a table perhaps ? ) had been hurled across the parlour and struck heavily against the wall . He heard Mrs. Cook shriek . Tot 's short huffings and declarations , he could hear those too . Did they have need of him ? In a paralysis of illness and indecision , he heard again the stifled whump of furniture . Neither sealing himself into his bed nor striding manfully into the parlour , Denis Cook crouched outside its doors , his eye fitted to the keyhole like a scarab in its setting . His eldest daughter was talking in a voice at once coquettish and demanding . He heard no respondent . Through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the crook of her elbow . She appeared to be writing something down . Denis Cook heard mention of a Navarino Road , a little street he knew well , not far from their own . There was a decent pub on Navarino , The Sword and Garter , where the owner would gladly fry up a chop if he brought one along to accompany his beer . Due to recent poverty , he had n't been there in a fortnight . Oh , pish . He stood up irritably . They 've gone mad . First the one daughter , now the rest of them hysterical as queens . For a second time , Cook trod the stairs which now seemed steeper and colder , climbing upward toward the comfort of his nightcap , the little oblivion of sleep . Queer this becomes , Madness . Now a second voice , not hers , but a man 's , speaking through me to mother . I am , it says , to be taken to a place on Navarino Road . I am , it says , to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't speak except to insinuate I 've deliberately ruined her life , that I 've no regard for anyone but myself , that I indulge myself in theatrics , that everyone pays for my behaviour . Does she think I can command myself any differently ? I feel as if I am inhabited by a host of selves , only one of them the sister she knows , rifle others are strangers to us both , and they are cruel , mischievous , indifferent , what is happening to me , what is happening to me ? Mother is frightened . Wit 's end , she says . These new instructions relieve her . Something to do . This afternoon I woke , having slept again all day . The new servant girl was standing beside the bed , staring down at me with a most peculiar expression . She was , I think , praying . Harriet Cook stood with her two daughters before a red brick Georgian terrace house , regarding the plaque affixed to the door THE DALSTON ASSOCIATION OF INQUIRIES INTO SPIRITUALISM 74 NAVARINO ROAD THOMAS BOYNTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplation of this address given them by Spirit . " Good Lord , it 's just a house , is n't it ? " With that , Selene raised her black-mittened hand and briskly reached for the brass knocker in the shape of a fox 's head , rapped three times , dislodging a tiny heap of snow between its sharp brass ears . On the several blocks ' walk to Navarino Road , they had had to traverse Richmond Road , pass directly beneath the row of tall , claret-draped windows of Miss Cliff 's School for Young Ladies . This had greatly vexed Octavia , who had not ceased brooding over the circumstance of her expulsion from that avenue of learning . Now however , Selene turned on her booted heel and descended the steps to the brick sidewalk , the first of their party to admit the pointless effort of their walk . Thus she only overheard , rather than observed , as did Octavia and Harriet Cook , the door draw open , the voice with its gravelly thread of cough , " Yes , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , I can not . Give your card , I 'll tell my son . I 'm no spiritualist . The dead have n't told any of us a thing we need to know . " The green door shut with sterner emphasis than it had opened . The three women walked back . In the late afternoon , rooks scudded heavily from wintry branch to wintry branch , and the sun burned with a silvery whiteness . Crossing the various streets , returning the way they had just come , they stepped cautiously , avoiding the unswept horse dung from carriages . Back home , they would await the response of the Secretary of the Dalston Association to their modest visiting card . * * * Thomas Boynton arrived at 6 Bruce Villas the next day by hansom cab . With neither hesitation nor inhibition , he mounted the icy steps , knocked at the door and waited until a giantess in a pink servant 's dress answered . Thomas Boynton found himself ushered into a scorching-hot dining room where Mrs. Cook sat none too patiently mending one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her desk conjugating French verbs , while the object of his visit , Selene Cook , lay draped upon a gold brocade sofa in a languid , heavy pose . Mr. Boynton was a youngish gentleman , short , too short , Mrs. Cook adjudged , with a well-proportioned but rather pimply face topped off by an unruly mop of black hair well in need of pomade . She could n't abide untrained hair on a man . He had a sparse beard , mournful black eyes and a strangely pendulous lower lip . There he stood in his black frock coat , top hat in his hands , sober and silent . Much like an undertaker 's assistant , Mrs. Cook thought . She spoke to the point , describing the recent , peculiar history of her eldest daughter , of Selene 's fits and trances , tantrums , the seeing of orbs of flame , the hearing of voices . Mr. Boynton listened , perched on the edge of Mr. Cook 's favourite , much stained chair . He listened with a solemnity which Mrs. Cook would later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense excitement . He declined tea or any sort of refreshment , for which Tot , batting about like a moth in the doorway , was grateful . Their supply of food in the pantry was much reduced these past weeks . Boynton asked if he might , however , return the following evening for a seance . He wished to observe for himself the girl 's powers . Mrs. Cook , having just stabbed her finger with the needle , nodded consent as she sucked at the dot of blood . ( Continues ... )
