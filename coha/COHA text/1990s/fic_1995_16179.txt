EXT . KENNEDY HIGH SCHOOL , DAY - 1994 GLEN HOLLAND , early 60 's , gets out of his ten-year-old Chevy station wagon . He approaches the school entrance . The dull , weathered letters on the building spell out " John F. Kennedy High School " . A marquee on the grass in front of the building says , " Home of the Hawkeyes " , and " Good Luck ! Class of 94 " . A few kids outside wave at Herrick . There are a few cars in the parking lot , fewer people hanging around  --  school is out . The rope on the flagpole clangs against the pole . A lonely , desolate sound . Holland , battered briefcase in one hand , folded file boxes in the other , trudges into the building . INT . KENNEDY HIGH Holland walks down the hallway . At the far end of the corridor a janitor is sweeping . All of the lockers hang open and empty . Holland enters a classroom . INT . MUSIC ROOM Holland stands in the doorway and takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circling high on the wall are pictures of Stephen Foster , George Gershwin , Art Tatum , Dizzy Gillespie , Hank Williams , Chuck Berry , Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys , one each of the four Beatles , Stevie Wonder , Elton John , The Ramones , Chrissie Hynde , Dylan , Springsteen , and of course , Bob Seger  --  this is Michigan after all . Cluttering the classroom is the detritus of the years  --  a dusty , stuffed Opus figure , a .45 record player , records , sheet music , a clear plastic paperweight with a dandelion suspended inside  --  a stained glass clef note hanging in the window  --  a bust of Beethoven , painted psychedelic . Holland breaks himself out of his reverie and walks over to the desk and drops the box and his briefcase . Where to begin ? He starts by trying to put one of the file boxes together . Without luck . He just ca n't figure it out . He is angry , frustrated , and very tired . And none of it has anything to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task that he does n't hear the entrance of NICK MEISTER , the boys ' gym teacher . Near 60 , his head as bald as a baby 's butt , a stomach like he was smuggling a watermelon under his sweatshirt.  --  3  --  &nbsp; MEISTERHi , Glen . . . Let me help here . So the bastards finally cut the music program . Damn shame . Damn shame . Wo n't be too long before the penny-pinching bastards start barking at my heels . You fought the good fight , Glen . &nbsp; HOLLANDAng got my butt whipped . But good . &nbsp; MEISTERKnow the feeling . I 'm the B'ball coach , remember . Meister takes the box from Holland and assembles it easily . &nbsp; HOLLANDYou do n't have anything to worry about , Nick . The day they cancel the sports program in any High School in this state it 'll be a sign of the collapse of civilization as we know it . &nbsp; MEISTERThey did it in Chicago . . . What are you going to do ? &nbsp; HOLLANDClean out my desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not sure , exactly . . . I 'm too young to retire and too old to rock and roll .

There is an uncomfortable silence as Holland looks around the room .  --  4  --  &nbsp; HOLLANDYou think so ? Obviously Holland does n't . Meister pauses a moment , then leaves . &nbsp; HOLLANDYou really think so ? Holland pulls open the desk drawers and starts sorting through them . Some things go into the wastebasket , others into the briefcase or the box . There is no joy in his work . Holland finishes with the desk drawers and goes over to the record player . There is a stack of .45 records on the table next to it . Sorting through the records brings a nostalgic smile . One record even prompts a laugh . Then he notices the electric keyboard , a Farfisa Mini-Compact . Scarred and beat with age . He turns it on with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken key , hits a chord . Section Details EXT . HOLIDAY INN , DUSK - 1962 The Holiday Inn marquee reads , " Goodbye ' 62 - Hello ' 63 Ring in the New Year w/Murray and the Madcaps " .

Iris is taking photographs of everybody .  --  5  --  " Mr. Custer " is brought to a big finish . Holland yanks off his hat as quickly at possible . &nbsp; MURRAYWe 're gon na take five , ladies and gents . But we 'll be right back to dance you into the New Year . Holland taps Murray . The two whisper . Murray shakes his head . Holland persists . " Part of the deal . . . " is heard from Holland . Murray goes back to the microphone . &nbsp; MURRAYBut first , an original song by our keyboard player , Glen Holland . Take it , Glen . Murray and the other band members leave the bandstand . Holland begins to play . Iris , fending off admirers and sorting out the drink order , takes notice of the song . A sweet melody , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays with all of his heart . And sings  --  not a great voice . Iris takes a photograph of Holland . &nbsp; HOLLANDI know you do n't know me , And I do n't know what I need to say . Words always fail me , And I 'm somehow worse today . But I can slow dance And the music is playing , So take just one chance And hear what it 's saying . Listen to the music , It 's speaking for me . Listen to the music , Put your arms around me . Listen to the music , That 's exactly how I feel .

His new keyboard . &nbsp; IRIS ( O.S. ) Need some glue ? Holland turns to see Iris , who reaches into her purse and pulls out a bottle of mucilage . He takes it , nonplussed . &nbsp; IRISThat was a pretty song . &nbsp; HOLLANDPretty . . . He thinks about that . He 'll take it as a compliment . He smiles at her . She smiles back . INT . HOLIDAY INN LOUNGE , LATER 3:00 a.m . The shambles of the party are being picked up by a couple of cleaning people . Holland and Iris are talking at a table .

Holland smiles and tries a twirl . EXT . BAR , DUSK Holland is unloading his Ford . Iris helps . Her ' 62 Corvair is parked nearby .  --  8  --  &nbsp; IRISBut how are you going to save money on these penny ante jobs ? At the end of the week you hardly clear gas and rent .

I 'm working out a plan , for the future . You know that teaching degree your mother made you get ? &nbsp; HOLLANDSomething to fall back on . Teaching . . . &nbsp; IRISWell , we could fall back on it . If you got a job teaching , High School pays the best , and we saved for , say , three years . . . No new car , and I worked , you could take almost two years off to work on the opus , with just me working . The way I have it worked out , twenty months , maybe twenty-two , without any large , unexpected expenses . Holland thinks about it . &nbsp; HOLLANDTeaching ? It 's almost a nine- to-five job .

Above the entrance the name of the school is being changed . " James A. Garfield " is now just a shadow on the unfaded brick . The maintenance man is on a ladder scrubbing away the dirt with a wire brush . On the grass below , the new letters are laid out  --  " John F. Kennedy " . There is no marquee on the grass yet . Holland enters the school with the flood of students . INT . KENNEDY HIGH , DAY Holland gets a few curious looks from the students as he walks down the hall .

The bell rings while he is still printing . He takes a breath and turns to face a classroom of kids . &nbsp; HOLLANDGood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I prefer to be called . Mr. Holland .

They fired her cute little butt . &nbsp; HOLLANDAnd him , too , of course . &nbsp; MEISTERNo , it was n't his fault . She was a flirt . Bunte got a reprimand , but his wife hit him with their Buick . He 's in Arizona recuperating and the wife is in Chicago , auditioning lawyers I 'd guess . Wolters is measuring each of the girls ' skirts . Several of the skirts do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the skirts are unrolled at the waist until they hit linoleum . The girls are released , their faces red .

Where 'd you go to school ? &nbsp; HOLLANDWestern , class of ' 59 . Never thought I 'd be here . I only got the teaching certificate because my parents raised such a ruckus .

Principal Wolters suddenly raises his head , like a predator catching scent of prey . &nbsp; WOLTERSWhat 's that ? The other teachers look up and pause . There is the sound of faint music in the air . &nbsp; HOLLANDWhat ? &nbsp; WOLTERSThat sound . &nbsp; HOLLAND " Surfin ' Bird " , by the Trashmen .

The living room of the house is a photography studio , lights set up , a large paper backdrop hanging from one wall  --  everything crowded among a huge record collection , the Farfisa , and a small piano . The baby wails , tears streaming down it 's red face . The mother waits in the doorway . &nbsp; MOTHERI do n't understand this at all . He 's usually such a happy baby . Iris and the mother try to amuse the baby , but to no avail . Holland enters , takes a look at the bawling kid . &nbsp; HOLLANDPerfect . He drops his briefcase . Iris gives him a peck on the cheek .

He screams like a banshee.  --  17  --  &nbsp; HOLLANDI remember when I was in school . I always wanted to be some place else .

Iris pins the schedule and budget to a cork board . &nbsp; pp. 20-38 INT . MUSIC ROOM , DAY Holland writes on the blackboard  --  " Lydian Mode " . &nbsp; HOLLANDThe Lydian mode is equivalent to the white keys on the piano , from F to F. From this we get the Ambrosian and Gregorian modes . Who can tell me where the term Gregorian comes from ? Holland looks at the class  --  they are in a severe trance of boredom .

The few notes do n't copy Young and Brubeck , but take the music to another level . He makes notations .  --  20  --  Totally absorbed , he does n't hear Iris , wearing a rubber apron over her clothes , come out of the red-lit bathroom . She slips up behind him and kisses his ear . &nbsp; HOLLANDOooh , what is that perfume , madame ? Eau de developer fluid ?

Why mess around with all of that paperwork for nothing ? I 'll stare at you and you stare at me and we 'll accomplish just about as much as when I lecture . Your grade point might even improve . The silence goes on for a long , uncomfortable moment . They are saved by the bell . &nbsp; HOLLANDClass dismissed . You can go , but I expect things to be different tomorrow . Understand me ?

She waits for the applause to die down . &nbsp; GERTRUDEI came here today to say my thanks to Mr. Glen Holland . I remember him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life . On a lot of lives , I know . And I have the feeling that Mr. Holland considers a great part of his life was misspent . He was always writing this symphony of his , this opus . Possibly to make him famous or rich , probably both . That is the American dream . . . But Mr. Holland is n't rich , or famous , outside our little town . And that does n't mean he 's a failure . ( more )  --  118  --  &nbsp; GERTRUDE ( continuing ) I think he has achieved a success beyond riches and fame . Look around you , Mr. Holland . There is not a life in this room that you have not touched . And each one is a better person because of you . This is your symphony , Mr. Holland . These people are the notes and melodies of your opus . And this is the music of your life . The audience gives Holland a standing ovation .

Mr. Holland , if you would take the baton and begin the first public performance of " The American Opus " by Glen Holland . She hands him the baton . He turns to the orchestra . The instruments are poised and ready . He looks down at the music stand . The sheet music is a copy of the original , in his handwriting . " The American Opus " by Glen Holland . He touches the sheets of music , looks at Iris . His Iris . He loves this woman . She motions him to get on with it . Then raises the baton , taps it once on the music stand and . . . the orchestra plays . The opening strains of the music fill the gym . Holland 's face glows and his chest fills with pride . It is a great symphony with elements of jazz , rock , country , tin pan alley , and classical . Gertrude goes over to one of the girls playing the clarinet and whispers in her ear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat , and plays . Then , out of the audience , one or two at a time , other adults approach the stage and  --  one by one  --  replace the students in the orchestra . Eventually the orchestra is composed completely of adults .  --  119  --  Holland cries openly as he leads them . And the various themes become clear  --  Gertrude 's theme , " Listen to the Music " , the music for Louis Rus , an ode to Coletrane , Rowena 's theme . And in the audience , resting in Iris ' lap , is the needlepoint  --  words encircled by twining ivy  --  " Life Is What Happens While You Are Making Other Plans " THE END pp. 77-98 &nbsp;
