Smoke billows from burning houses in the Valley of a Thousand Hills in Natal province , where at least 39 die in clashes among feuding Zulus . In the town of Welkom in the Orange Free State , a black mob surrounds a minibus , hacks to death the six black occupants and sets fire to the vehicle . In the southern Transvaal township of Sebokeng , police open fire on a crowd of 50,000 people protesting high rents , killing perhaps eleven . In Katlehong , east of Johannesburg , war erupts among black taxi drivers , leaving at least 25 dead and scores injured . <P> Is this the new South Africa promised by the unbanning of the African National Congress and the release of Nelson Mandela ? As the A.N.C . prepared for its first meeting with the government of President F.W. de Klerk  --  an April 11 session has already been called off by the A.N.C . in protest at the Sebokeng shootings  --  the spiral of violence was forcing Mandela to face a sober reality : that he may have wielded more moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does as a political leader in his second month of freedom . <P> Locked away in jail , where he could not speak publicly or even have his picture published , Mandela was an ethereal inspiration to continued resistance against apartheid .

" When he was still in jail , there was nothing that he could do wrong , " says Willie Breytenbach , head of African studies at the University of Stellenbosch .
