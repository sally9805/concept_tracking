From I Am the One You Think <p> " Actually that child never should have been born , and her parents just disappearing  --  leaving their car and vanishing . Drunk , obviously . Leaving the child to an elderly female and a severely disabled old maid who has n't left her sickroom for the last thirty years . <p> " Well , maybe that 's an exaggeration , but the child 's alive and has to be educated . She 's intelligent and writes to us dutifully every month . She gets good marks from the headmistress ... but we ca n't get close to her . She 's polite , but she goes her own way ... I 'm afraid of her . <p> " She does n't take after her mother or her grandmother , she 's more like Aunt Malena , more 's the pity . It was Gustava and Aunt Malena who drove me away from home . No normal person can breathe in that house . It was definitely because of that house they felt they had to go out to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had found a place . And then they go and disappear ... " <p> She writes in her diary , which of course I read every time I visit them , know where she hides it , she writes she is afraid of me and that I 'm polite . I hope my grandmother was n't like her  --  they 're twins , but Gustava says they were n't identical . <p> Gustava says it 's the grief of losing both her sons that makes her so  --  unapproachable , Gustava calls it . <p> I 'm her only grandchild , my father was her eldest son . Is it my fault he disappeared ? She never says dead . Uncle Bernhard is dead . He drove into a house in his car . He is still alive in a way because he has a grave she can visit . I have always wished they would find something or other  --  a bone or two from a skeleton that might have belonged to my parents  --  then she would be happy again . Know where they were . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is silent and introspective . Retired from the state railroad . Loves his trains and spends every morning on the platform of the little station near their house . That stretch of line is closed now . Gustava says he grieved that more than his children . I usually go down to the station with him every time I visit . <p> They are my nearest relations even though I feel closer to Gustava ' s side . I do n't understand family . <p> Actually I never should have been born . But is it really true that I was born ? <p> I know when I myself began . When I was seven and had been going to school for a year , every day I would draw the plan of a house with a huge yard around it . People I had seen and whose faces I liked for one reason or another lived in its various rooms . I talked to them , and they told me about themselves . About their lives and about what they were going to do later on  --  always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I myself lived in different places out in the big yard . Most often in a special tree where I had built a hut . <p> It was there I met the other . <p> At first , I thought it was my unborn twin sister  --  why should n't I have been a twin too ? But it soon became clear that the other was a bird ; it lived in my treehouse and , without my knowing , it had helped me to build my house there . I seldom got close enough to the other that I could see its feathers and colors properly . At first , I thought it was very big and kept itself hidden only so as not to scare me . That seemed funny to me , because I was n't afraid of anything at that time , or so I thought . I heard its voice close beside me when I sat drawing my daily plans of reality . You see , I had to learn to understand reality before it was too late . <p> It was either too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or it was a question of waiting for the opportunity . <p> The day my bird showed itself to me for the first time , I was frightened , even though it had given me plenty of warning . <p> " Why do you want to see me ? " it asked several times , " Surely it 's enough for you to know I 'm close by and that we speak to each other with no trouble ? " <p> But I wanted to see it and had collected various especially lovely pine cones  --  it lived on pine cones  --  that I wanted to give it . It had already caught sight of the pine cones , perhaps it had even shown me where they were  --  anyway , I could see that it arranged the cones in that particular pattern that stood for satisfaction . It made me almost happy and very sleepy  --  the kind of sleepiness that comes over you in the shade on hot days just after a meal . <p> The light hummed as if it were full of bees , and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun . <p> Suddenly I felt a coolness come over my face , and a heavy weight pressed my left hand down to the ground . I was sure it was the ground my hand was pressed onto , I could feel the stones and the big tree roots very clearly . But I was sitting up in the tree , and nobody could possibly have such long arms . When I opened my eyes in a great fright  --  because of the long arm I must have grown and wanted to pull my hand back-I was looking straight into one of the bird 's globelike eyes . <p> I saw myself sitting in there surrounded by a rainbow ; then the bird blinked twice and I disappeared from its eye . Now I saw the whole of its head . It was very black and somehow gleamed  --  lit from within at the base of the feathers ; and its beak was yellower than a lemon . It smiled , and it had a slightly paler ring round the root of its beak . I wanted to touch its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was forced down on the ground , and I now saw that the weight was due to the bird 's having put one of its feet on my left hand . I got scared again and tried to move my hand out from under its claws , but it was impossible . <p> " Now you 're frightened of me , " the bird said in its familiar voice . " I said you 'd be frightened . " Then it took its leg away and my hand resumed its usual form . The bird accepted all the pine cones , and I saw the rest of its body . It was gleaming . Iridescent black on its back and wings . Had this almost fiery glow just beneath the surface of the feathers . Its legs were yellow like its beak but did n't shine quite as much . <p> At the start of our friendship , I was frightened each time it moved on its legs . It did n't bother me when it spread its huge wings and now and then closed them around me . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and very lonely . <p> It was only later that I understood why . <p> It did n't take long before I could fly too  --  although only with the bird , whom I named Grikulla . It flew underneath and supported me on the currents of air made by its wingbeats . I swam there , just as I did in the river , and I could see the valley and all the towns along the river . Grikulla had the strange quality of being translucent to the point of invisibility when she flew . I was invisible too , of course , which had great advantages . <p> It was during that period of my life that I learned how useful it can be to remain unseen in human affairs . Not invisible , merely unseen . I brought my experiences with me even when I was not flying with Grikulla . She was always with me somewhere or other , nearby . As far as I could tell , her place was on top of my bookcase . <p> So I had to keep this place free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> My roommates at school were very surprised when , for instance , I refused to allow them to put their suitcases up there when I had so much room and their shelves were always chock-full of stuff . I had my own things stored under my bed . The only thing I would have on my bookcase was my globe . Because I knew Grikulla would appreciate the wide view of the world provided by a globe at that time . <p> I never told anyone about her . It would frighten them needlessly . After all , they could n't see her since she was visible only to me . She also taught me to transfer the panorama I loved to immerse myself in when we flew to my schoolwork . The letters and the words they formed were like houses in towns spread out over a landscape , spread not randomly but corresponding to the necessity felt by the people who lived in the houses to exist in that very place . This meaning behind the words , the sentences , and the passages they composed appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to see and install in my early houses in the big garden . I remembered and understood by studying the expressions on these faces . By waiting till they turned their faces toward me and told me their stories . <p> So it often happened that I knew different things  --  and sometimes more  --  than my teachers said I was supposed to . Grikulla asked me to keep certain details to myself . <p> Every time I did not follow her advice , difficulties arose ; and when she distanced herself from me for a time  --  in the period when I was at a school far from any pine forest  --  actually it was located in the middle of a town , and of course she lived on pine cones  --  at that time , I did poorly at school , and my schoolmates complained to the teachers about my strange behavior . <p> During that time , I always had to explain my actions , and since I could seldom remember them when they were succeeded by fresh " actions , " I spent most of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which looked out on the only tree in the school grounds , waiting for Grikulla to come back . <p> Perhaps it was the only tree in the town ? <p> Obviously it was n't , but it was a little pine tree that , for some reason or other , had been allowed to remain there . All the other trees in the town were deciduous trees , attractive and friendly , but with no longing in their leaves . <p> It was also in this isolated phase of my life that the headmistress received a complaint from a laundry in the neighborhood . The four women employees complained that a pupil was spying on them when they were at work . <p> They had tried to ask if she had some errand there , perhaps was bringing some clothes to wash or picking something up , but had n't gotten an answer : the girl had gone away without a word . But she had turned up outside their windows again for the next few days , so they had felt obliged to inform the school . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their service , but they objected to pupils ' intruding into their business . <p> From the description the ladies at the laundry had given of the pupil in question , the headmistress knew at once that it must be me , and she called me into her office one afternoon after school . She looked at me in silence for a few minutes , then asked whether I was lonely . <p> She did n't mention the complaint right away . She asked me whether I was without friends just then . While waiting for me to answer , she lit a small , dark , slender cigar and then carefully studied the half-empty box to see that the rest of the little cigars lay in the right order . She let the smoke filter slowly out over her lower lip and chin . Blew it down over her chest and took a used envelope out of the wastebasket . Still waiting and smoking , she folded the envelope a couple of times so that it fit into the empty space in the cigar box and placed it carefully inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then tested the system to verify that it worked before closing up the box and putting it up on a shelf beside the big writing desk behind her . <p> She had noticed me watching all her movements attentively and at length she said , when I still had n't answered her questions about my loneliness and possible lack of friends at the moment : " You have to understand that not everybody likes someone looking at them . Your way of looking is quite-now how shall I describe it  --  " she smiled suddenly and looked completely different , her face spread out , somehow opened , and she let the cigar smoke escape crookedly through the left side of her smile , " your special way of looking at people is troubling for those who may not realize what in heaven 's name they 're doing , poor things . They can certainly feel that you see through the mechanics of their movements , and then maybe they feel you 're asking them about something they themselves never imagined anyone could think of asking . Something very private about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was right , and then I asked why she had blown out her smoke like that . The very moment I asked , we both knew that I already knew why , so instead she asked me to help her arrange the flowers for the Easter festival in the school 's little chapel . <p> Not until several weeks later did she ask me what it was at the laundry that had interested me so much . <p> Grikulla , having eaten her fill up in the mountains behind the town , had come back by then , so I told the headmistress that it was the way the laundresses walked back and forth . <p> " Walked back and forth ? " she repeated , and now for the first time she looked at me in genuine astonishment . Her dark triangular eyes looked directly through my own . I could feel her gaze searching for something she could understand at the very core of my head , so I could n't help putting one hand to the back of my neck . <p> She saw my movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people you look at feel sometimes , " she said , and her eyes turned more oval . " The language of the eye is the most powerful means of human expression . Far more violent than a blow . Can be deadly . Take care you do n't expose anyone to the force of your eyes without a very good reason . " <p> She turned her back on me and looked out through the odd narrow window of her office . I knew that she could see the same tree that I had looked at all winter from the dining hall . <p> She repeated : " Walking back and forth . " <p> I saw the shadow of Grikulla over her shoulder outside the window . She was obviously sitting in the tree at that moment , so I felt warm and happy . " Yes , " I answered , " they run back and forth with short little synchronized steps , as if it was against the rules to take longer steps between the washbowls and the big mangles . " <p> " Have you noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the window and sitting down in her chair behind her desk . " Come over here , and I 'll show you something . " When I went up to her , she had lifted her skirt above her knees , and I saw that one knee consisted of a jointed mechanism with a bowl-shaped top in which her own leg  --  the rest of the thigh  --  fitted . Padded leather straps held the artificial leg in place and apparently led up over her lilac-colored , very elegant underpants to a belt . Directly below the knee joint , the artificial leg was shaped just like her other leg , and a knee-stocking , matching the other leg 's long stocking , was carefully pulled up to the knee joint , ending in a little roll . <p> " You had n't expected that , had you ? " she asked , and her voice suddenly sounded different . <p> I wanted to go on looking at the leg but forced myself to look into her eyes . She looked a little sad and reached for one of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the desk , so I got it , remembering at the same time to bring along the dancing female figure carrying a torch ; you could get a flame from it by pressing the dancer 's head . I took out a cigar and gave it to her , then pressed the dancer 's head and watched the flame spring up . She sucked on the cigar and took the dancer from my hand . The strong-smelling blue smoke wrapped itself round us , and I noticed fleetingly that her fingers were cold . <p> " Your leg ca n't be seen when you walk , " I answered , " but it can be heard . There 's a slightly different sound to your walk . " <p> " I ca n't get rid of it , " her new voice replied . " Even though every evening , when I take off the leg , I lubricate the four joints that make up the knee . Sewing machine oil , " she added smiling , " oil I steal from the Crafts room . It 's become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle or two from the school now and then  --  without the Crafts teachers finding out , mind you . " <p> She laughed properly now , and when I heard her laughter , I was more surprised than I had been at seeing her artificial leg . She noted my changed expression at once and stretched out a hand to me . I did n't want to touch her hand , but Grikulla whispered that it was necessary to show her some trust , so I put one of my hands in hers and could feel that her fingers had grown warmer and that their grip was firm . <p> " You do n't need to be so afraid of other people 's feelings . We all have something or other we keep hidden from others . It 's always something we ourselves dislike , but that 's where we have to start our life . It 's in this hidden and painful place that we must begin to love . Then we also dare to live . " <p> " Yes , " Grikulla said behind my back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What is it that 's hurting you ? " she asked and pulled her skirt down over her legs . <p> " I want to see myself , " Grikulla spoke out through my voice . That Grikulla had answered made me so dizzy that I sat down without thinking that I had never seen anyone  --  either teachers or other pupils  --  sit down in the headmistress 's presence . But now I sat and felt that this chair had been waiting for me always . <p> " I 'm glad you 've managed to sit down at last . I 've been waiting for that for a long time . " She said , " It 's hard to get close to you . " <p> I felt an immediate urge to get up , but Grikulla whispered to me to stay where I was : " She is n't hunting , and you 're not an animal in the forest ; besides , you have only to look at her with your open gaze , then you 'll be able to understand that she 's shown herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with what Grikulla called my open gaze , and it made me so happy that I tucked one leg up underneath me , which I always did when I sat in the kitchen at home with Gustava . <p> " Why do the laundry ladies run around like that ? " came my voice . " They have white faces , and their eyes look inward into the dark . I can see that they 're talking but ca n't hear . anything because of the noise of the big mangles . That 's why I had to go there so many times . You should just see how they run , a bit bent forward even when they 're not carrying anything . And it looks so strange when they open the washing machines and empty out the clothes into big baskets . They look like the guts of big animals . They pull everything out of the machines ' bodies . They pull and tear out the clothes and pile them into their baskets as if they hated them . I would n't want them to wash my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill them and then crush them in the mangles . That 's what I saw . " <p> " But you know what it is they 're really doing . Even though I can certainly understand that 's what it can look like . Do n't you have a washing machine at home ? " I had expected her question , so I was glad to be able to tell her that Gustava always did her washing in " the old way , " as Aunt Malena called it . <p> " In the winter we use the washing machine in the basement , but in the summer Gustava goes up into the mountains just behind town where the real washing place is . In the summer there are still several women who go and do their washing together beside the river . Gustava says it 's better for people 's clothes to be washed out in the fresh air . Lots of us children g6 with them up there . We go swimming while the others are washing . Afterwards we help spread the clothes out on the flat rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the midday wind starts to lift the corners of the sheets , we know it 's time to collect the small garments or they 'll fly off like birds , and that can give you bad dreams at night . Once or twice I forgot some of my own night clothes on purpose , so I could see them fly away . It can be hard to find them again then , but usually they get stuck in the big chestnut trees below the washing place ; the pants kick in the wind as if they want to go even farther away , and if you do n't get them down before it 's dark , that 's when you dream . " <p> I heard the headmistress 's voice asking from far away what you dreamed about . She had lit another of the little black cigars , and I saw how she pressed the dancer 's head once or twice and made the torch flame up . The smoke drifted around her face , and she seemed to be hovering up into the bookshelf behind her . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard my voice say . And Grikulla whispered inside me that now I could tell her about our flying trips over the valley and the towns . <p> " I fly out over the valley and look down on the towns along the big river . I can see into all the houses , and I see everything they do in their kitchens , in the living rooms , where they eat ; and even at night , I can see through the dark into their bedrooms . They 're not always asleep . The grown-ups often talk about their children ; they think the children are always asleep when they 're in bed , but the children listen through the walls and hear everything they say . That 's how the children get to know that they actually should never have been born . " <p> Suddenly I could n't say anymore . I got up from the chair , but had forgotten I 'd tucked one leg under me , so I fell down , and not until I 'd pulled myself up again and stood upright in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew she would ask . <p> " You actually should never have been born ? " <p> I was afraid she would go on , but she got up too and came toward me . <p> She had a little book in her hand , one of the ones we always used for our vocabulary lessons . <p> " You must write a couple of pages in this for me every day . <p> Now , I 'm going to write your name on the outside , and write that this book is to be brought to me by you yourself when you feel like it . " <p> Then she wrote very carefully what she said she would write , and gave me the book . <p> " It 's not a diary , " she said when I took the book , " It 's a story book that can keep hold of reality for you . It 's important that you write it to me because you can be sure I 'll be glad to read it . Everything  --  you do n't need to hide anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add that , and I could see she agreed with me about it . <p> Not long afterward , when I had filled the book and came to give it to her , I had bought a little bottle of sewing machine oil , which I had decorated with painted birds . The paint was still not quite dry  --  I told her this when I put it beside the dancer on her table . <p> She did n't thank me but gave me a new book , which she had already written on and given a number  --  a 2 drawn with big flourishes and a couple of flowers growing out through the head of the number , like the capital letters in a real live book . <p> At first , Grikulla helped me write in the books , but she gradually came to feel more and more trapped in the town . She stayed away for longer and longer periods , and one morning she said she wanted to go back to her own home . I had my books and knew where I could find her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I called for her . <p> We said good-bye in the sunshine of the dining hall , and the last I saw of Grikulla was her beautiful wings as she rose from the tree outside the window and flew straight up toward the sun and left the town behind . <p> She had put a big shiny green pine cone on the windowsill for me , and I just managed to hide it in my pocket and shut the window before all the others came in to breakfast . <p> That day we had ham and fried eggs and fresh baked bread , because it was the last day of school before the summer vacation . The headmistress gave me twelve new books , and I promised to write . <p> Note 8 <p> For 26 April 2038 <p> After reading and studying the second text-unit of the Fieldbook , the four decided on the areas in which each would undertake further investigations . <p> Achillea maintains that the name of the child can only be interpreted/ understood in context with the mother 's first enormous reaction . Her view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the point of view is the child 's . She will also pay particular attention to the child 's relationship with the two other residents in the house . <p> Malva 's formulation was brief and precise : a closer investigation of fantasy figures and symbols as escape routes from reality . <p> Urtica presented an equally limited and precise formulation : the importance of names to existence in time . <p> Viscum wishes to isolate/delimit the nature of memory . Seeks permission to postpone a final formulation until further text-units have been studied . But is already aware that he will probably choose his examples from the men described in the texts . <p> The day following their first experience of scent and silence , it was found necessary to make a further increase in the daily rations to the point of intensive care . All very worried . I have explained to them that station assignments out in these particular positions always demand extraordinary rations and that they would never have been selected for further training in recording the cultural expression of human studies if their **28;105;TOOLONG tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> The weather is windy and overcast .

Viscum both whistles and raps out sound signals-undoubtedly musical . Uses his voice in the wrong way . Pressed . Smiles now and then . <p> Note 9 <p> For 27 April 2038 <p> The change of viewpoint in the second text-unit fascinates them . Want verified evidence as to who speaks/writes . Assume for the time being it is the child , as Achillea calls the narrator . They agree on the child 's age . Fourteen . <p> When I asked how they could say that with such certainty , they all replied that there were various examples of developed understanding of symbols . But Malva agreed with me that the narrator seemed emotionally immature , although this might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was remembered . Viscum declared to us that " selective omission " would be his research starting point . Urtica thought this theme was inadvisable , as it was not possible to verify . Malva wanted to test the name Grikulla . Ascertained that it did not exist . But as the name covers a definite function in relation to the child , all accepted her limitation both of the origin of the word as an imitation of a sound as well as of the range within which the concept was applied . Escape route from reality . " What reality ? " I asked . " The historically conditioned year 1984 , " she replied . Consideration has been given to both geographical area and middle-class tradition . As proof she presented data from the geographical-historical generator . <p> I asked no further questions . Heard that Viscum retested the origin of the name . Thinks that the common blackbird may be the natural explanation . Urtica does not understand why this creature should not then be called blackbird . <p> None of them had any knowledge of blackbirds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while , then looked at two short films about blackbirds . They felt the sounds were too extensive and could not possibly emanate from the relatively minor movements that production of the sounds induced in the sample birds . But all had to accept the visual documentation and actual sound recordings as former documentation of nature . Viscum whistled several times like a blackbird . Problem set aside as unsolved for the time being . <p> The wind has shifted to south-southeast . The weather will improve . <p> Note 10 <p> For 30 April 2038 <p> The weather is fine . Sun and light easterly breeze . <p> We have carried out two outdoor investigations . None of them has yet needed to go outside the station alone . Yesterday I myself made a trip to the lighthouse .

Only home births could bring about such erroneous reactions . She declined to provide any further evidence . Problem remains open . <p> Urtica has found two fossilized sea urchins . Smiled for the first time . Has the others ' permission to regard them as her own . Wants to sketch them . <p> For 2 May 2038 <p> Gale from the west . All working separately .
