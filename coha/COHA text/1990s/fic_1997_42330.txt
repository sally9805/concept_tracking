It was a chilly autumn night , and Jack and Melissa were snuggled on her couch , watching a video and getting in a cozy mood . She was in her underwear and a T-shirt , with black socks pulled up over her calves . Her work clothes were in a pile on a nearby chair . Jack was still in his jeans and a T-shirt . <p> The one non-cozy aspect of the situation , from Melissa 's point of view , was the video that Jack had selected , or rather insisted upon watching : Apocalypse Now . Other than a brief shot af Martin Sheen 's bare ass , she was finding it a bit abstract . But she knew that he wanted her to like it , so she leaned into his shoulder , pulled her feet under her , and watched . She could feel the warmth of his chest . He was a warm person , literally . <p> They had been together nine months . In the beginning they went out often . There was something exhibitionistic about their ventures into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other off , and to revel in their newfound status as one half of a pair . But lately they 'd been spending more and more time at home , her home . She had made an effort to make her living space accommodating and pleasant ; it was soft-edged , pillow strewn , a bit peach in atmosphere and color . His place was either barren or pristine , depending on how you looked at it , and their time there was a little like time in a motel roomexciting , theatrical , and alienating . <p> Then the phone rang , and Melissa cocked her head at the sound of it , not wanting to walk the ten steps into the kitchen and wanting with equal measure not to subject one of her friends to the humiliation of babbling into a machine while the two of them listened . <p> " I 'll get it , " she said in the middle of the second ring , and got up from the couch . <p> " Do you want me to press pause ? " asked Jack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . The voice on the phone belonged to Roderick Donoghue . It took her by surprise and made her shiver . It was deep and low and much too intimate . <p> " Hello Melissa , it 's Roderick , " he said . " I 'm just calling to say hi , see how you are . " He had a way of pronouncing the most innocent comments in a sordid , suggestive manner , as though he were stroking her ass while saying it . This sort of duplicity was , she had come to understand , his **25;678;TOOLONG and cordiality providing a thin gloss for his weirdly obsessive and unpleasant nature . His faintly Southern accent was particularly useful in obscuring his cause . <p> " Hi , " she said , and instinctively glanced at Jack to see if he had registered any anxiety , any falseness in her voice . She thought she sounded shrill and self-incriminating , but Jack just stared at the screen , watching Martin Sheen sulk on a boat going up the Mekong River . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last conversation , " Roderick said . <p> " You mean the one where I said I did n't think you were behaving properly and that your behavior was in fact offending me and that I wanted you to stop touching me that way , " she wanted to say . <p> " Umm , yeah ? " she said instead , and concentrated on the background noise-a faint hiss-trying to figure out if he was calling from his cell phone again . When he had last called she had talked with him merrily for an hour , feeling the peculiar liberation and freedom that comes with the implied distance of a phone conversation , only to have him blurt out : " I 'm in a car right in front of your building . Why do n't I just come up and we can continue this in person ? " She had been so flustered by this that she agreed . <p> " I thought the conversation did n't really go the way it should have , " he said now , " which was unfortunate given that we normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television talk show host of the highbrow variety . Rapport was his specialty . She had spent several years of her life concluding many of her evenings lying in bed and watching him nod intelligently at one important , fascinating , and powerful guest after another , interrupting them with penetrating questions and lulling her with his deep , comforting , and faintly paternal voice . Who could blame her for being excited when she met him at a party ? <p> She had rehashed this line of thought many times-Her Innocence at the Beginning . They had met at the party for the New York Film Festival , where she worked as a publicist . She had placed numerous calls to his office reiterating the invitation at the instruction of her boss . So it was natural that she should introduce herself They had chatted amicably and he had listened attentively and nodded as she spoke-just like he did on the show-and she had felt the particular thrill of that enrapt , attentive expression he always bestowed upon his guests . <p> " You 're a very intelligent and perceptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm curious to hear suggestions you might have for people on my show . " She was aware that he was flattering her . She did n't mind . She was flattered to be flattered . <p> " Um , I 'm sort of watching a movie , " she said now . <p> " Which movie are you sort of watching ? " he asked . <p> " Apocalypse Now , " she said . " You can hit pause , " he said . She wanted to snap something rude and witty at him . <p> " I 'm just going to watch the movie now , " she said instead . " Why do n't we speak later ? " This was as terse as she could to be without being conspicuous . <p> " All right . I really wanted to say that I 'd like to see you again . I do n't want there to be any awkwardness between us because of my last visit . I enjoy your company and also value your opinions . I 'm doing a onehour special on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe even help produce . It 's all very preliminary . " <p> She was amazed to note her body stiffen a little when he said all this , as though she were a cat being stroked . Her intellect registered the falseness , but she had heard him utter so many words with that homespun Southern accent of his , addressing the guests on his show , that she was instinctively pleased to have such good company in being deceived . She flashed to another moment of weakness , when she had ushered him into her apartment as though he was there all the time . In a sense , he was . Something very similar to the body that had stood before her had been in her apartment countless numbers of times before , but it had been confined by the parameters of the television screen . It had been unsettling to have it before her in all its ungainly , life-sized reality . <p> She remembered the weird way his body had occupied space in her apartment , sitting right there on the couch where Jack now sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his suit and tie , smelling faintly of cologne . She did n't smell the cologne until he got near her , and right away she could picture him applying it , standing in the mirror and letting his face go slack with admiration while thinking : " Women love this smell , and they love me . " <p> He had said kind , intelligent words of praise to her , loosened his tie , and then he had put his hand on her thigh and stroked it . There was so much gross sexual energy in that single caress that she had almost abided it and allowed him to continue . <p> The idea of letting this overly suave , self-possessed , attractive , and successful older man barge into her life and f-k her , thereby letting his already distorted ego pump even further out of shape at his success with her , was so repulsive that her mind froze in a kind of fascination when considering it . He stroked her thigh several times and moved closer . She was under a kind of spell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphor for the whole situation . There was something rank , false , and toxic about this man . She slapped his hand away and asked him to leave . <p> " All right , " she said now . " I 'll talk to you soon . " Her voice softened at the very end , as though to leave the door to Roderick open just a crack . She put the phone down , aware of her moment of duplicity . <p> She went back to the couch where Jack sat slouched , clutching the video remote and , as she leaned back against him , was aware of how much she hoped he had noticed something . She wanted him to call her on it . He was always getting into moods and sulks . What she wanted from him was some rage , threat , and anger . She wanted action . <p> Jack , without looking at her , pressed rewind . Images flickered backward on the screen . A boat raced backward down a river , lead by man water-skiing backward . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should really see the whole thing straight through . " He put his right arm around her and casually pulled her against him . <p> " Who was that on the phone ? " he asked nonchalantly . <p> " Jim Milford , " she lied , citing an old friend from college who was familiar to Jack as Just a Friend . She was a terrible liar . Whenever she attempted it she tried to remember what she normally sounded like , and drew an utter blank , thereby being forced to impersonate a self she could n't imagine . The words slipped out and she glanced at his expression to see if there was a flicker of suspicion . She half hoped to find it . There was nothing but Jack 's slack television gaze , focused on the screen , and for a brief moment she hated him for his complacency even more than she hated herself for her duplicity . For a split second she considered blurting it all out but then decided that would be ridiculous . She had n't done anything wrong . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't going to do all the work . <p> Jack kept his cool . There was nothing to be gained by expressing the intense pang of anger and fear that had shot through him when he heard her voice dip and observed her body twist slightly , turning away from him just before she put the phone down . And now this outlandish lie about who she was talking to , her voice trilling upward , her nostrils flaring , her desperate glance to see if he noticed . He had always cherished her sincerity , and in a way he was touched by this transparency . But he was also furious , disgusted , and frightened , and all the emotions that had been coursing through him for weeks were further inflamed by this new complication . He had come to see Melissa as an enormous shock absorber between him and the world . He sank into her house , her pillows , her ; he experienced this as a narcotic , not as love . It removed him from life as opposed to bringing him closer to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the concern that , like a narcotic , he was becoming addicted to her . He felt the swell of fear-as well as the resentment-that comes with dependence . He depended on her even for housing at this point . His own home was strange to him . It was a place he changed socks . And even these had been migrating to her fluffy apartment . <p> " Baby , " he said , summoning the paternal , Big Daddy attitude he often did when he wanted her to calm down and do what he wanted . " This is a really good movie . You have to concentrate a little , but it 's worth it . " <p> " Okay , honey , " she said . She looked into his eyes in that way of hers-trusting , sweet , soft , and open , but spiced with a tiny but fierce self-preserving instinct , within which , he thought , was the ability to deceive . He admired that . He liked it when she was strong . <p> Then he remembered the betrayal he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinding desire to slap her across the face . He wanted it both ways . He had no idea what he wanted . In the midst of his confusion he was determined to be calm and bide his time . <p> He tried to resist the pleasure the night had to offer-her kindness , softness , the sweetness of coupledom-but could not , and eventually , as sugar turns into energy , his anger and irritation transformed into lust . He began stroking her hair and kissing her neck . Their bodies melded into one another . She received his touches with a weird energy that stemmed as much from relief as from desire . <p> The sounds of a helicopter attack on a small Vietnamese village filled the room . At first he found the war sounds to be an interesting juxtaposition , but then they became distracting , and , grappling for the remote , he hit pause and threw it on the floor with abandon . They started touching and kissing again and soon were having an amazingly desperate encounter on the couch , his pants around his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pants around his ankles . Then the pause automatically ended , and the movie picked up right in the middle of Robert Duvall walking around with his bastard expression and cowboy hat saying , " I love the smell of napalm in the morning ... smells like victory . " <p> " I do n't believe it , " Jack said , a little embarrassed , as though someone had in fact walked into the room . He had to grapple to find the remote control in order to turn the video off , then a game show popped on the television when the video went off , necessitating a frantic search for the other remote to quell the horrible screams of game show pleasure . By then there was almost nothing left . <p> " I 'm being destroyed by technology , " he feebly joked . For a while they just lay there next to each other , breathing . Gradually , they recovered and began again . There was some nugget of panic and desperation in his chest-triggered by the frantic search for the remote controls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hushed sound of her voice on the phone-but his insecurity made the sex better , as though he wanted to devour her and thereby be assured that no betrayal was forthcoming . At the end of it he noticed her cheeks were bright pink . He was never sure whether this meant that something had actually happened , but he always took it as a personal triumph . <p> Afterward she went to the bathroom , and he stood , pulled his pants up , and went to the kitchen counter , where a gaggle of electronic devices were pushed into the corner-phone , answering machine , and a small white gadget she had purchased several months ago , Caller ID . This little white box registered the number and the name of the person calling you on a small LED screen . He hit the " last call " button and a number popped up along with a name : R. Donoghue . What a clever little device , he thought . <p> She had told him it had been an impulse buy at Bed , Bath , and Beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I thought , what the hell , $19.99 , it could be interesting , " she had said . Perfect that a store specializing in the pleasures of the home and hearth , a place devoted to the comforts of couples , should have such a suspicious device stuck there as an afterthought , as though the hour or two their patrons had spent contemplating the pleasures to be had using their fluffy white towels , cuddling in flannel sheets , cooking on immaculate Teflon , was the perfect setup for a pang of paranoia : What is really going on with the person with whom all this comfort is to be shared ? <p> He stared at the number on the little gray screen . He heard the faint sound of the toilet flushing and , like a shoplifter who stuffs something in a pocket without thought only to feel a sense of shock at what they have just done and a simultaneous sense of its irreversibility , he picked up the phone and dialed the number . There was something perverted and betraying about this gesture just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then he had been betrayed , too . Or had he ? He hovered on the edge of hateful , seething feelings that , in all truth , had no real basis . And if he hung up right away , they never would . Some self-preserving instinct told him to do so ; the part of him addicted to the soft warmth of her , the fluffy-towel-loving part of him that wanted pleasure and comfort and softness in the world , told him to hang up and be done with it . <p> But there was another force within him too , destructive and condemning , an Old Testament fire-and-brimstone force , that said life should be hard , that wanted to punish . <p> She came into the room in her nightgown , a powder puff of loveliness . She gave him a mildly quizzical look when she saw him on the phone . <p> " Hello , " came a voice after the second ring . " Hello ? " If one went to Central Casting and said , " We need a voice for the Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It almost made him laugh . The only weird thing was that there was a hint of familiarity in it . He looked at Melissa standing there looking at him , and felt horrible at last . It was a kind of catharsis , to be such a sh-t that one no longer hated the other person but hated oneself . In feeling guilty toward her he could cleanse himself of his anger toward her . He put the phone down in the middle of the third , " Hello ? " <p> " Do you want to watch the movie some more ? " she asked . She was being accommodating . <p> " No , hon. That 's fine . " He went and hugged her . <p> " Who was that ? " she said softly . <p> " My answering machine . " <p> They got into her fluffy bed , cuddled , turned on the television , held onto one another , flipped channels , browsed through countless voices and images , shared the remote control , both secretly thinking that the television was killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the world against which they could define themselves , and when the remote was in his hands he happened to come across Martin Sheen , of all people , being interviewed on a talk show of the highminded variety , by a man whose low Southern accent was vaguely familiar . " Let 's watch this for a while , " he said . <p> Author Affiliation
