Section : The Nature of Learning <p> Injury to a small curlicue of brain tissue called the hippocampus produces such profound amnesia that people so affected greet as a stranger someone they met and talked with minutes earlier . Reasoning and intelligence remain intact in these people , but recent experiences vanish , destroying all hope of a normal life . Humans are not alone in their dependence on an intact hippocampus . The ability of many other animals to learn from experience has also been show n to involve this part of the brain . <p> The hippocampus  --  more properly called the hippocampal formation because it consists of a number of structures  --  was given its name by the sixteenth-century Italian anatomist Giulio Cesare Aranzi , who saw in the overall shape of the human hippocampus a resemblance to Hippocampus , the seahorse . The human hippocampus is distinguished by curving , inter-leaved fields of neurons . It is a bilateral structure about the size and shape of a small green bean , occupying 2.5 to 3.0 cubic centimeters in the right and left temporal lobes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C-shaped curve deep in the brain with the same distinctive arrangement of neuron fields . In birds , the hippocampus is wedge shaped , descending from the top of the brain into the crevasse dividing the left and right hemispheres . Despite these differences in appearance , embryological and neuroanatomical evidence shows that the hippocampuses of birds and mammals are true homologues , that is , they evolved from a brain structure possessed by an ancestor common to both groups . <p> Recently , laboratory and field studies have shed light on the different functions of the hippocampus in a variety of animals . Jays , chickadees , and nuthatches , for example , are champion food storers , hiding thousands of nuts , seeds , and other comestibles over the course of a year ; they have a remarkable ability to remember , weeks or even months later , where they stashed their food . Part of the secret to their success is a big hippocampus . <p> The black-capped chickadee stores seeds and invertebrate prey in scattered hiding places , mostly in fall and winter . Its hippocampus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 percent of the forebrain , compared with about 4 cubic millimeters and only 1.5 percent of the forebrain in the house wren , a species that feeds on insects and other invertebrates and does not store its food . The forebrain in both species is about 300 cubic millimeters , about the size of a raisin . Hippocampus size varies even among species of birds that store food . In western North America , the life of a Clark 's nutcracker largely revolves around collecting , transporting , and storing pine seeds in the fall and retrieving them during the winter and spring . The pinyon jay , gray-breasted jay , and scrub jay  --  other western members of the corvid ( crow ) family  --  store nuts , seeds , and acorns , too , but not to the same degree ; they also are less successful at relocating caches and solving other spatial problems in laboratory experiments . Significantly , the hippocampus of these species is considerably smaller than the Clark 's nutcracker 's . Similar relationships between food storing and hippocampal size have been found in European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chickadees and titmice . <p> Researchers working with voles  --  small rodents in the genus Microtus  --  have also uncovered a connection between hippocampal size and an animal 's ability to remember the places it has been and where it needs to go . Working in the laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh , Steve Gaulin and his colleagues tested the skills of meadow voles at finding their way around a maze and discovered that males are better at it than females . The male meadow vole 's hippocampus , as shown in further studies by Lucia Jacobs , now at the University of California , Berkeley , turns out to be larger than the female 's . There is a good ecological reason for these sex differences . Like most species in this genus , the meadow vole is polygamous . During the breeding season , the male expands its home range to encompass the smaller ranges of several females and then faces the challenge of navigating within this home range , finding the females , and mating with them . Prairie and pine voles are closely related to meadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to search out multiple females . In these species , there are no sex-based differences in home range size , spatial ability , or hippocampal size . <p> Another example of the interplay of ecology , behavior , and hippocampal size comes from the brown-headed cowbird , a member of the blackbird family . Rather than build nests or care for their young , these brood parasites lay their eggs  --  up to forty a year  --  in the nests of other birds , including warblers , vireos , fly-catchers , finches , and thrushes . Female cowbirds usually lay an egg shortly before dawn , spending the remainder of the morning searching for nests to parasitize on subsequent days . They may sit quietly in the trees , spying on unsuspecting potential " hosts , " or walk silently along the forest floor while looking up into the canopy ; sometimes they fly noisily through the brush , perhaps to locate a nest by flushing out incubating birds . Female cowbirds must find and remember  --  perhaps for several days  --  a variety of nest sites dispersed through the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spatial memory . With no need to find or remember nest sites , they spend much of their time following the females around and feeding with them later in the day in livestock yards and grain fields , away from the forest edges where most host nests are situated . These males have a smaller hippocampus than do the females . Closely related species that are not brood parasites , such as the red-winged blackbird , show no such difference between the male and female hippocampus . <p> Of all the evolutionary influences that can affect hippocampal size , the crucial variable in all animals studied so far is how they use space  --  whether it is to remember seed caches or nest sites or to navigate around in a big home range . What about human amnesiacs ? They , too , have difficulties with spatial memory , but that 's not all . People with damage to the hippocampus ( caused , for example , by strokes , head injury , or Alzheimer 's disease ) lack what Larry Squire and his colleagues at the University of California , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring remembered information to mind . Remembering what is on the cover of this magazine or what the weather was like last winter are examples of this sort of memory . Tying your shoes or understanding the meaning of printed words also requires memory , but in these cases its role is more implicit and seems not to involve active remembering in the way declarative memory does . Hippocampal damage does not disrupt memory of this kind : people who can not remember a conversation that took place minutes ago may be able  --  gradually  --  to learn and remember how to play a new game or carry out a task on a computer . With repetition , amnesiac individuals can acquire these skills without remembering when or how they learned them , or even if they ever did . <p> What explains the apparent difference in the role of the hippocampus in humans compared with its role in other mammals and birds ? One possibility is that until the advent of primates , spatial ability was the major force shaping the evolution of this part of the brain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ultimately humans may have led to the acquisition by the hippocampus of a more general role in memory , handling not only spatial memory but information of many kinds . If this idea is correct , it would be interesting to discover whether declarative memory of the more general kind bears traces of its origins as spatial memory . Spatial imagery certainly pervades our thinking about all sorts of topics . Events lie ahead of us or behind us in time . We stand beside our friends or go out of our way for them . We get behind good ideas and try to get on top of problems . <p> Alternatively , declarative memory may have long been the function of the hippocampus in birds and mammals , but for most of these animals , the task of remembering where they are , where they have been , and where they are going may be the main job of declarative memory and the easiest such memory to observe . Only new information on the function and evolution of the hippocampus can provide a complete answer to this question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
