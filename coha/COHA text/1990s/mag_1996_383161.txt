Two reasons to play at Grand Cypress : 45 holes designed by Jack Nicklaus and the best-kept fairways and greens in Orlando . // IT HAS BEEN SAID that you could spend an entire month in Orlando , Florida-home to Walt Disney World and countless other attractions-and still not see and do everything . Well , the same can be said for the golf in Orlando . More than 150 courses lie within a 45-minute drive of downtown , putting Orlando up there , in terms of quantity , with such other golf meccas as Myrtle Beach , South Carolina , and Phoenix , Arizona . And the courses are diverse too , ranging from all-world resort layouts to surprisingly good public tracks . But where does one start ? Clearly , some distinctions would be helpful in dealing with the huge selection available . So we 've come up with a system , picking out some " mustplay " courses-where the price of admission is n't even a consideration-for the top tier , some strong semi-private and upscale public facilities for the middle tier , and several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result is 11 places that pretty much represent the greater Orlando spectrum . IF PRICE IS NO OBJECT TWO ORLANDO RESORTSGrand Cypress and Walt Disney World-are current GOLF MAGAZINE Gold Medal winners , and Arnold Palmer 's Bay Hill Club and Lodge has been a perennial Silver Medalist . Considering that the coveted Gold Medal graces only about 15 resorts throughout the United States , it is a measure of the standard of golf in this area that two awardees lie within 10 miles of each other . Grand Cypress has the plushest resort tracks in town . Its 45 holesall designed by Jack Nicklaus-are maintained to private club standards . The North , South , and East nines weave through the resort 's trademark pyramid mounds , which resemble giant chocolate kisses coated in golden fescue . Along with legions of white-sand bunkers and glimmering lakes , these mounds provide a striking contrast to the carpet-like fairways and greens . An entirely different experience awaits at the New Course at Grand Cypress . Built in 1988 , this expansive links was created to capture the flavor of the Old Course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as parking lots and virtually no trees , the New Course relies on pot bunkering and slick double greens to supply the challenge . Play it in the afternoon , when late-day shadows bring out the subtle ripples and rolls that Nicklaus agonized overand gusting winds provide a hint of golf 's homeland . Grand Cypress also has one of the more advanced teaching centers in the country , the Grand Cypress Academy of Golf , which offers a computerized " perfect-swing " model that allows you to match up your move to that of the world 's best touring pros . Access to the golf courses and the Academy is available to guests staying in resort villas or at the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress . Current green fees are $85 . ( Note : All quoted green fees include cart rental and apply at press time . Rates will go up in the fall and again in December or January. ) // Quick Facts Photograph Southern Dunes is loaded with native-sand bunkers , nearly 200 in all . // When Nicklaus arrived on the Orlando golf scene , Arnold Palmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Bay Hill in 1965 , and liked the place so much that he and a group of investors wound up buying it . Today he spends most of each winter at Bay Hill , playing golf and playing host . Although several PGA Tour pros-among them Corey Pavin and Steve Lowery-call Bay Hill home , this is unmistakably Palmer 's place . The clubhouse is full of photos of The King in his glory days , and the golf course stirs the emotions in the same way Palmer 's go-for-broke playing style once did . Famous for its watery doglegs and swift , multitiered greens , Bay Hill currently ranks 15th on GOLF MAGAZINE 'S list of the top 100 public-access courses in the country and is a favorite among Tour players , who compete here each spring in the Bay Hill Invitational . From the " Palmer " tees , the course plays to a hardy 7,114 yards and dares you with long approach shots , half of which must contend with greenside water hazards . When the holes are tucked in their traditional Sunday positions , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the Invitational telecasts every year . The club is private but open to guests of the charming , course-side Bay Hill Lodge . Green fees , breakfast , and range balls are included in an overnight stay at the Lodge for $165 ( single ) or $254 ( double ) . The Disney World Resort can be considered a golf destination all its own , with 99 holes of public-access golf . The Palm , Magnolia , and Lake Buena Vista courses , all designed by Joe Lee , host the Tour 's Walt Disney World/Oldsmobile Golf Classic each fall . Stalwarts since the early 1970s , these courses represent solid , old-style Florida golf : Flat , wellbunkered , and strong from the back tees . But Disney took golf to another level in 1992 with the opening of a new 36-hole facility called Bonnet Creek Golf Club . No stones were left unturned in the development of Bonnet Creek . The two hottest architects in the game , Tom Fazio and Pete Dye , were commissioned to design side-byside layouts on a secluded tract of sandy pineland five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dye course , is a low-profile test characterized by generous fairways and big , boldly undulating greens . The holes are framed by slash pines and water oaks , and sandy stretches of pine straw and love grass provide the visual appeal . But even from the back tees , at 6,772 yards , Eagle Pines is eminently playable . Better players should head for Osprey Ridge , a 7,101-yard Fazio gem that roams among wetlands and thick wilderness . Huge , serpentine bunkers dart in and out of the fairways and water lurks on about half the holes . Approach shots must negotiate elevated greensites and lots of deep , scalloped bunkers . Osprey Ridge is the toughest and best-looking course at Disney . Both courses at Bonnet Creek were selected by GOLF MAGAZINE as top 10 new public-access courses in the country in 1992 . And with no housing visible from either layout , Bonnet Creek provides a quiet respite from the pandemonium of the nearby theme parks . Green fees at all five Disney courses : $95 ( $85 for Disney Resort guests ) . THE DEALS JUST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a half-hour south of Disney World in the woodlands of Haines City . Grenelefe has three 18-hole courses , the East , West , and South . Designed by Robert Trent Jones , the West Course is the meatiest of the three , playing at 7,325 yards from the tips to a Course Rating of 75.0 and a Slope of 130 . It can be truly unyielding , which is one good reason the PGA Tour has held its Qualifying School Finals here three times since 1985 , and will again in 1997 . Framed by stands of pine and oak trees , the West typically calls for allcarry approaches over bunkers to small greens . If you play from the back tees , you 'd better know how to float a 3-iron high and soft or you 'll have a rake in your hand all day . This is one course where good sense should prevail over machismo : Step up to the appropriate tees . The South Course , which has cohosted the Q-School with the West , has the largest , most treacherous greens at the resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lakeside scenery . The East is the shortest but tight treelines allow for plenty of adventure . Grenelefe caters to the resort guest but is open to the public on a space-available basis . Green fees : $30-$50 . Photograph With five lakeside holes and sculptured bunkers , Falcon 's Fire is a visual feast // Neighboring Southern Dunes Golf &; Country Club got its start thanks to a natural disaster . On Christmas Day of 1989 , a brutal freeze gripped the region , devastating the orange groves that flourished on this site . Soon after , the decision was made to turn the land into a golf community . Local architect Steve Smyers was called in to lay out the course , which sits atop a vast sand ridge that runs through much of central Florida . The 7,227-yard layout is defined by multiple cuts of thick , gnarled rough-trees were a decorative afterthought-and is kept hard and fast , inviting the bump-and-run game . Most memorable is its collection of some 200 broad , gaping bunkers , whose clay-colored " sugar sand " is the native soil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third birthday , Southern Dunes has established itself as one of central Florida 's top semi-private golf facilities . Green fees : $27-$40 . Heading back towards Orlando you 'll find an excellent daily-fee course in Kissimmee called Falcon 's Fire , five miles from Disney . Opened in 1993 , Falcon 's Fire is distinguished by superb turf conditions and five precarious lakefront holes . Architect Rees Jones lined the fairways with extensive mounding , which helps to redirect errant drives , but clusters of fairway bunkers await the unlucky bounce . The 394-yard 13th hole alone boasts 14 fairway bunkers on the left-and water on the right . A battle from tee to green , it 's aptly named " Bunker Hill . " Falcon 's Fire is part of a planned resort community called Seralago , which is scheduled to include five hotels , more than 500 villas , and several restaurants . To date , only the golf course and clubhouse have been developed . Green fees : $52-$62 . MetroWest Country Club , as its name suggests , lies just a few miles west of downtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones in the late-1980s , this semi-private course is a city-side jewel , rambling alongside numerous lakes and through 100-foot elevation changes . The 13th green sits on the highest point in Orlando , offering a broad panorama of the golf course and the city 's business center . Roomy off the tee , MetroWest toughens up around the greens , where plenty of flash-faced bunkers and even a few pots come into play . Green fees : $52 . THE STEALS ABOUT 10 MILES west of Orlando in the suburb of Ocoee is Forest Lake Golf Club , a two-year-old semiprivate layout designed by the local firm of Clifton , Ezell &; Clifton . Carved from thick stands of oak and hickory trees , Forest Lake sprawls over a peaceful , wooded site , with no plans for housing development . Especially eye-catching is the use of several natural lakes , which feed right up into the sand of greenside " beach bunkers. " // Private Stash // Also notable , Forest Lake has two sets of forward tees : One for inexperienced players and juniors , measuring 5,103 yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate to a longer course but still not suited to the middle tees . A post-round libation can be enjoyed in " The Rusty Niblick , " a cozy , dark-wood grill . Green fees : $25-$30 . Back within Orlando city limits , Hunter 's Creek Golf Course has an interesting claim to fame : It 's the longest layout in Florida . Stretching to a monstrous 7,432 yards from the way-backs , Hunter 's Creek is a true titan , with eight of its 10 par fours exceeding 420 yards , and three at 450 or better . Designed by Lloyd Clifton in the mid-1980s ( before he started the aforementioned firm with his son , George , and Ken Ezell ) , Hunter 's Creek allows ample room off the tee to bust the driver , which may be required from the fairway as well . The course is a favorite among both locals and tourists , notching 60,000 rounds a year without a dime spent on advertising . Green fees : $32 . The same Japanese company that built Hunter 's Creek developed Palisades Golf Course in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A creation of Joe Lee , designer of the original Disney courses , Palisades is sited on a remote piece of hilltop property adjacent to Lake Minneola , with holes perched on tall bluffs overlooking the water . Within the course , three holes run along the shores of Spring Lake and marsh features define some of the fairways . It 's an incredible tract of elevated land , unusual for central Florida , and golfers are flocking to see it . Green fees : $26-$30 . Word is out about EastWood Country Club , too . A semi-private facility , EastWood opened in east Orlando in 1989 and is already wellknown for its outstanding conditioning-some say its greens are kept as well as any in the area . The first project to be completed by the Clifton , Ezell &; Clifton firm , the course contains water on 11 holes , including the 184-yard 14th , the club 's island green signature hole . EastWood winds through a housing development on the front nine before ducking into the woods for the second half . Green fees : $29-$39 . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexpensive day away from the theme parks , Orlando should be able to satisfy your golfing appetite .
