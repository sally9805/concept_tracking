Thanks to some inspired golf , the Presidents Cup is getting better , but it 's still an imitation . // THOSE WHO work at PGA Tour headquarters will doggedly insist that September 's second version of the Presidents Cup was at least as dramatic as the last five Ryder Cups combined . However , participant Fred Couples-in his own uniquely eloquent way-explained the difference between this conjured-up event and the event it was conjured up to copy . " If we want to play this in their home country , " he said of the opposition , " I guess we 'd have to play it in Orlando . " Exactly right . While the International team consisted of golfers born in far-flung places like Australia , Zimbabwe , South Africa , Fiji , and Japan , only five actually live overseas . Five Internationals live in Florida and two reside in Texas . More than half of the so-called bad guys , including the team 's two superstars , Greg Norman and Nick Price , were familiar and friendly with the American players and popular with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be the same-as squaring off with all those brooding , obsessed-with-victory Europeans . As popular as Seve Ballesteros is worldwide , his attitude toward the Ryder Cup has made him a hero to Europeans and the perfect villain for Americans . Nick Faldo 's image might have changed lately , but he 'll always be the enemy after 20 years of playing on the European Ryder Cup team . Colin Montgomerie ? European fans do n't even root for him most of the time . What the Presidents Cup lacks-besides 70 years of tradition-is tension . That 's not to minimize the drama of the last afternoon or Couples 's heroic 2 5-foot putt on the 17th hole of the final match against Vijay Singh that clinched an emotional , narrow one-point victory for the Americans . Everyone involved was thrilled that the Internationals , after an awful start Friday ( down 712 to 21/2 ) were able to battle back to keep the match alive until the 32 d and last point was decided . Even so , the feeling in that dramatic last hour was a long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Couples mugging for the camera on the back nine of his singles match during the Ryder Cup ? That 's what he did at the Presidents Cup , looking into a CBS hand-held camera and joking about how he was playing so badly he had managed to mess Singh up just as much . You might say , Oh , that 's just Fred . ' But Fred is n't Fred when the Ryder Cup is at stake . Remember 1989 , when he collapsed in tears on the 18th green at The Belfry after losing his singles match to Christy O'Connor Jr. ? Or 1993 , when he practically bit Tom Watson 's head off when the U.S. captain tried to give him a pep talk as he struggled to two Saturday losses ? What sets the Ryder Cup apart is that players want to win the Presidents Cup , but they do n't thirst for it in the same way . The people who run the PGA Tourand there were no fewer than 79 Tour folks airlifted in from Ponte Vedra Beach for this event-will tell you that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Captain Peter Thomson threw down the gauntlet on Thursday by declaring his pairing of Norman and Robert Allenby " invincible , " there was no one in the vicinity on Friday who invoked the names of Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal when Couples and Davis Love III beat the " invincible " duo twice . No one accused anyone of coughing at the wrong moment or using a wrong ball or of any kind of gamesmanship . It was good , clean golf . Many will say that 's as it should be . They are n't wrong . This is not to say the Presidents Cup does n't have a future or that it is without significance . Although the International team players said repeatedlyand justifiably-that they think Presidents Cup III should be played overseas , the plan when the ' ' 96 Cup ended was to come back to the U.S. one more time-no , not to Orlandoand then go to Australia in the year 2000 and have Presidents Cup IV coincide with the Olympics in Sydney . Officials think the event should be staged in the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major deal . It is worth remembering that before Couples 's Sunday heroics , the Presidents Cup was n't even the biggest golf event of the week : It was Tiger Woods 's attempt to win the Quad City Classic . In fact , several prominent media members bailed out on Sunday to fly to Coal Valley in case of a Woods win . Fortunately for those who want this event to become-as the onslaught of pre-event hype kept telling us- " a tradition in the making , " Woods faltered on Sunday and the 12 singles matches produced some superb moments . Chalk one up for PC-that 's Presidents Cup , not Political Correctnessalthough the week was full of that sort of thing , what with President Clinton in attendance Friday and former President Bush around the entire week as the honorary chairman . No doubt a lot of politicking and haggling will be done before a final decision is made on exactly where PC III will be staged . There 's no question that the players on both teams will object if PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golf Club for a third time . All the weird slopes and mounds on the greens and the placing of the fairway traps have not made the course popular with the players , in spite of the breathtaking scenery . Assuming the event returns to the U.S. in 1998 , Finchem and company will have to make a decision : return to RTJ where it costs almost nothing to stage the event because of a sweetheart deal from the club , or pony up some serious bucks to go to a more traditional venue . While the future of the Presidents Cup remains a question that only time will provide an answer for , the weekend in Virginia did make one thing crystal clear : while Europe continues to search for the Ryder Cup successors to Ballesteros , Faldo , Olazabal and company , the next generation of American players is very much ready to take its place for the team Tom Kite will captain at Valderrama next year . Consider this : David Duval , Steve Stricker , Justin Leonard , and Phil Mickelson , four key elements in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Throw in Woods , who already has a proven track record in match play , and even John Daly , who has yet to make a U.S. team but does have two major titles to his credit , and you have six players with serious resumes , the oldest of whom is Daly-at 30 . Finchem certainly would n't want to hear his event described in these terms , but if nothing else , the PC will be a valuable Ryder Cup training ground for Americans . In 1994 , Mickelson , Tom Lehman , and Jeff Maggert all made their debuts as part of an American team in PC I and all three played very well a year later in the Ryder Cup . You can bet that this year 's experience will benefit Duval , Stricker , and Leonard in Spain . Of course , the Ryder Cup players will have a totally different experience . That event will be played in front of a hostile crowd against players who , generally speaking , show up in the U.S. six or seven times a year . Since all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tour PC ( political correctness ) not to publicly castigate the PC ( Presidents Cup ) in any way , getting them to compare the two events for the record is difficult . But one player did say this : " The difference is simple : we all feel as if we want to win the Presidents Cup ; the Ryder Cup we need to win . " That does n't mean the Presidents Cup wo n't grow into an outstanding event or that this year did n't provide memorable shots . At least now , when the hype starts to build for 1998 , there will be some actual " moments " to show instead of the overhyped , overplayed alleged moments from PC I , a 20-12 U.S. romp . Two days before PC II began , U.S. captain Arnold Palmer , whose presence lent credibility and grace to the week , made this comment : " It would n't be a complete disaster if we were to lose . " He finished the thought by saying that it would be a disaster for him , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 30 times , it will no doubt become more meaningful and significant . For now , it was a fine week of golf . There is no need to try and make it anything more . Right , Fred ? <p>
