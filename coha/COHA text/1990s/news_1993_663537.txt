<p> Part II : Tampa Bay Still Waiting for a Baseball Team <p> Fool me once , shame on you . Fool me twice , shame on me . But seven times ? By that measure , the people of St. Petersburg are baseball 's fools . <p> This is a city that built a $ 138 million stadium with no tenant . That tried and failed to lure five teams . That lost an expansion bid to Miami . That signed a contract to buy the San Francisco Giants only to watch it scuttled by baseball 's owners . <p> " Tampa Bay feels like it 's been beaten like a rug by baseball , without apparent good cause , " said Tony Cunningham , a lawyer for investors in two of the lost bids who are suing baseball . <p> All this , and yet sunny St. Pete , with its quiet , palm-lined streets , long causeways and postcard harbor , still desperately wants to join the club that wo n't have it as a member . The desire is part money , part pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want major league baseball ? <p> The more relevant question , though , is why baseball has n't wanted Tampa Bay , the nation 's 13th biggest media market , a population of 2 million within 30 minutes of the Florida Suncoast Dome , St. Petersburg 's empty spaceship-by-the-sea . <p> The rejections lean heavily on matters political and economic . But like so many issues in the business of baseball , they are linked to the game 's exclusion from federal antitrust laws . <p> Last August , a group of local investors reached agreement to buy the Giants for $ 115 million . San Francisco-area voters four times had rejected new stadium plans and local bidders had not emerged , so then-baseball commissioner Fay Vincent said the Giants met relocation criteria . <p> But National League owners rejected the sale on the grounds of protecting franchise stability . Baseball then helped recruit local investors , led by then-Safeway Inc. chairman Peter Magowan , who bought the Giants for $ 100 million . <p> " We had a binding contract , with an exclusivity in it , with earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager , Rick Dodge , the area 's most determined lobbyist for and dogged critic of baseball . <p> From 1984 to 1992 , Tampa Bay unsucessfully wooed , in order , the Minnesota Twins , Oakland Athletics , Chicago White Sox , Texas Rangers and Seattle Mariners . Expansion franchises were awarded in 1991 to Miami and Denver . <p> Most local officials rationalized those failures , largely because there were no contracts . In the Giants case , however , everyone smelled a double-cross . <p> The rejection has prompted two lawsuits in Tampa Bay , two in San Francisco and a bid to investigate the deal by the state attorney general 's office . Two businessmen who were removed from the group are suing baseball in federal court in Philadelphia . Another set of investors , spurned in the Twins and Rangers courtings and in expansion , has sued baseball on antitrust grounds . <p> Baseball 's defense : The game 's 71-year-old antitrust exemption gives it total control over the matters under litigation . <p> " Franchise ownership and location issues are central to the business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers . " And any suggestion ... that the exemption does not apply to these critical issues is simply wrong and without legal support . " <p> Baseball officials stress that Tampa Bay never was promised a team . In fact , then-baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth advised the city in 1986 that building a stadium would n't help it get an expansion franchise . <p> St. Petersburg and the Tampa Bay investors argue that the National League and San Francisco illegally interfered with and conspired against a signed contract to sell the Giants . They say the behavior exceeded baseball 's monopoly right to control franchise movement . <p> By soliciting new bids , the plaintiffs claim baseball used non-competitive tactics to override Tampa Bay 's offer . They also accuse the Miami franchise owner , H. Wayne Huizenga , of conspiring with other National League owners to block the bid . Huizenga and baseball deny the allegations . <p> " Just because a monopolist is recognized ... does n't give that monopolist the right to commit other illegal acts in the name of the monopoly , " said Bruce Kauffman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tampa Bay group . <p> Baseball argues that league approval is required before any franchise relocation - there has n't been one since 1972 - regardless whether a deal is signed . No one told Tampa Bay the move would be approved , and officials argue the deal was n't legally binding . <p> " That ' contract ' was subject to several conditions , the most definitive of which ... was the submission and approval of major league baseball , " said Pat Mahoney , San Francisco 's assistant city attorney . <p> A blow to the antitrust fight came in January when a Florida circuit court judge quashed a bid by the state attorney general to interview National League President Bill White about the Giants non-deal . <p> The judge , R. James Stroker , said the exemption " quite clearly contradicts the entire existing body of law concerning the application of antitrust regulations , " but that he was bound by 1953 and 1972 Supreme Court rulings upholding it . <p> " If baseball 's decision to keep the Giants in San Francisco is exempt from antitrust laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that decision must also be protected and exempted business activity , " he wrote . <p> Baseball has beaten similar challenges before . In 1966 , Wisconsin sued the Milwaukee Braves under state antitrust laws when the team moved to Atlanta . The state supreme court rejected the claim . <p> Washington state sued the American League after the Seattle Pilots left for Milwaukee in 1972 , claiming the city built the Kingdome at the league 's behest . The case was settled out of court in 1975 when the AL granted Seattle an expansion franchise . <p> That 's a solution Tampa Bay would welcome . In fact , the litigation and recent congressional inquiries into removing baseball 's antitrust exclusion may be tactics for St. Petersburg to get a team . <p> City officials and economists believe the region is a victim - of other clubs ' using it as leverage to get better stadiums , and of baseball 's desire to retain Tampa Bay for expansion , in which owners could share a $ 100 million-plus fee . <p> To placate Tampa Bay , and end the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than later . For instance , baseball could add two teams for a total of 30 and split into six five-team divisions . <p> Until that happens , the Suncoast Dome hosts arena football and monster truck rallies and horse jumping , costing more than $ 1 million a year in city subsidies . The Florida Marlins draw big crowds in Miami . The Giants lead the Western Division . The only major league baseball in St. Petersburg is spring training , dating to 1914 . <p> " Here 's the greatest irony - this community has done all it 's done out of love for baseball , " said Dodge , the assistant city manager , who remains convinced St. Petersburg will get a team . <p> " It 's going to happen because the economic interests of baseball are like arcing stars in the sky that will intersect for the 28 owners , " he said . " When that day comes , baseball will be here . " <p> NEXT : Without Exemption , Could Minor Leagues Survive ?
