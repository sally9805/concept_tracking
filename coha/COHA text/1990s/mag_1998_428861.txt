A new class of painkillers could revolutionize arthritis therapy , and may even fight cancer and Alzheimer 's . <p> In the autumn of 1979 , I began to train for the Boston Marathon . Each day I ran from my laboratory , at the Harvard Medical School , along the Charles River and back  --  some 15 miles . To increase my stamina , I began to row on a stationary machine . I soon developed a stabbing pain in my lower back . A sports orthopedist I consulted told me that I had early arthritis of the lumbar spine , probably from years of running on city pavement , and that some of the disks there were bulging from the strain of rowing . <p> I was told to stop all exercise , lie in bed , and begin taking high doses of aspirin . It was a wonderfully low-tech approach , and as a physician , I appreciated its good sense . Sir John Vane , a pharmacologist in Britain , had recently elucidated how aspirin works . ( He later received the Nobel prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called prostaglandins , which are responsible for the cardinal features of inflammation : pain , redness , heat , and swelling . Aspirin reduces the prostaglandins by blocking an enzyme that helps make them  --  an enzyme known as cyclooxygenase , or COX . <p> I soon learned that the reality was n't as elegant as the theory . Aspirin and similar nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , or NSAIDS  --  their trade names include Motrin and Aleve  --  were disappointing in their benefits and significant in their side effects : my stomach burned , my ears buzzed , I became dizzy . In desperation , I underwent back surgery . When I woke up , my legs were frozen in pain . I had bled around the spinal nerves during the operation : NSAIDS prevent blood from clotting normally , by poisoning the platelets . I was then placed on Percocet , a narcotic , which made me dopey and nauseated . For three months , I lay in bed on a rubber pad filled with ice chips to numb my back . I ended up with worsened spinal arthritis , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and similar maladies , I 've had to make do with those NSAIDS , while pondering the inadequacies of the modern medicine cabinet . <p> People often think of inflammation as merely an annoying symptom . But inflammation does n't just signal injury ; it can  --  in a vicious cycle  --  perpetuate injury . That 's why disorders like arthritis can be so crippling , chronic , and hard to treat . And that 's why patients are willing to risk serious side effects for drugs that offer even a temporary respite . <p> Several biotech companies have plans to bring out a number of powerful drugs to treat the severest of the joint diseases , rheumatoid arthritis . So debilitating is this affliction that these treatments have been widely heralded despite their potential dangers . The drugs  --  including Enbrel and Avakine  --  may make you vulnerable to life-threatening infection and cancers such as lymphoma . In addition , the animal proteins on which some of these new treatments are based can trigger severe allergic reactions . <p> So the alternatives have remained grim : high-risk  --  and necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of inflammatory disease , and NSAIDS for the rest of us . But recently an industry scientist , Philip Needleman , has transformed the treatment of pain and inflammation by creating a compound that is potent in its effects , yet appears to be far safer than any other known anti-inflammatory . More than 10,000 people have been tested , and none have experienced any side effects . Not only does the drug represent a quantum leap forward in the therapy of arthritis , but if some promising research is borne out , it may even play a role in preventing or treating a host of other conditions , from cancer to Alzheimer 's disease . <p> " So I 'm cranking along , you know , studying inflammation in rabbits , " Needleman told me , in an exuberant Brooklyn accent . " And this rabbit 's kidney was exploding with prostaglandins . Where , I asked myself , was this explosion coming from ? " Needleman is over six feet tall and , with his broad shoulders and fleshy face , resembles an aging linebacker . He cheerfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's kidney he was studying years ago when he was the chairman of the pharmacology department at Washington University in St. Louis . A series of experiments involving the kidney tissue pointed to agitated white blood cells , which were recognized sources of inflammatory substances . " But then we did the T-shirt experiment ! " <p> Needleman is one of the most eminent researchers in the study of inflammation  --  a member of the National Academy of Sciences and , since 1991 , the chief scientist at the Monsanto Company . His lab is stocked with high-speed centrifuges , protein sequencers , and gamma counters . But a T-shirt experiment ? <p> " You know  --  like , you 're with your kid , and you get a stenciled T-shirt , so you wear it across your chest , " he explained . " It 's someone or something that you believe in , that you 're willing to do anything and everything in the world to see through , to the very end . And you want to wear it on your chest  --  like Save the Whales ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Needleman had bathed tissue from the inflamed rabbit kidney in a chemical that eliminated the source of ordinary prostaglandin manufacture . And yet prostaglandins were still being pumped out . What if inflamed cells had a way of manufacturing prostaglandins that was completely different from the way healthy cells did so ? At this point it was merely a conjecture , but Needleman felt so confident of it that he was ready to wear it on his chest . <p> And the more research he did , the more certain he became that there were two kinds of COX enzyme . One enzyme would provide the " housekeeper " prostaglandins  --  the regular , modest levels that kept our stomach , platelets , kidneys , and other tissues in working order . The second enzyme was produced only in the event of inflammation or trauma , and generated the high levels of prostaglandins that cause inflammation . If COX-1 was a garden sprinkler , COX-2 was a water cannon . <p> Late in 1990 , at an international conference in Florence , Needleman gave an address predicting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that blocking COX-2 would selectively control inflammation without disturbing our physiology . Shortly afterward , other scientists confirmed his hypothesis and isolated the second enzyme . Now Needleman 's efforts were directed at finding a drug that could discriminate between the two enzymes . " I mobilized all the medicinal chemists at Monsanto , " he told me . " It was a once-in-a-lifetime chance . " If his faith in his hypothesis was impressive , so was his ability to convince a chemical giant that it should enlist a large portion of its pharmaceutical resources to work on a single project . In fact , he was recently named co-president of G.D . Searle , Monsanto 's pharmaceutical division . <p> Needleman and his expanded team attacked the problem on several fronts . By cloning the gene for COX-2 , they prepared a large amount of the enzyme . Needleman had already gone on what he called a " seven-day sabbatical " to Sir John Vane 's laboratory , in England , in order to learn all the Nobel laureate 's techniques for assessing inflammation . Now he reviewed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach while still effective against inflammation . These , he reasoned , might have a much greater affinity for COX-2 than for COX-1 , and their chemical structures might give a clue to why . Soon , the Monsanto group sculpted a chemical backbone that was refined into a compound , called celecoxib , that blocked COX-2 and spared COX-1 . Studies of celecoxib progressed smoothly from the test tube to animals and then to man . In March 1995 , five years after Needleman floated his hypothesis in Florence , the first patient was treated with the new drug , which Monsanto has named Celebra . <p> For thousands of years before Needleman 's breakthrough , the medical approach to inflammation essentially amounted to variations on a theme . The ancient Egyptians employed preparations of myrtle leaves to relieve joint and other pains . Hippocrates prescribed the sap of willow bark for similar complaints and for fever . The active substance in these botanical remedies was salicylic acid . In 1897 , the Bayer Company . in Germany , synthesized a more effective preparation  --  acetylsalicylic acid , better known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortly after the Second World War , could not be used for chronic therapy of arthritis , because it proved to have devastating effects . ) The newer NSAIDS developed in this century are chemically distinct from aspirin but work by the same mechanism that John Vane discovered : they , too , reduce prostaglandin production by inhibiting the COX enzymes . <p> NSAIDS , despite their many side effects and limited potency , are some of the most heavily used drugs in the world . Indeed , they 're one of the pillars of the modern pharmaceutical industry , prescribed for everything from migraine headaches to tennis elbow . Last year , 77 million prescriptions for NSAIDS were written in the United States , and an equal quantity of these drugs was probably bought over the counter . In this country alone , they account for sales of as much as eight billion dollars a year . The cost of their side effects is more difficult to calculate , but every year some 80,000 Americans are hospitalized , and some 8,000 die , as a consequence of them . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pills regularly for pain do n't experience any dire medical emergencies . For many of them , including tens of millions of arthritics ( whose numbers grow as the population ages ) , the NSAIDS present a choice between ulcers and aches . And even at high doses , the relief afforded too often falls short of the relief required . <p> Rich Dillon is a 53-year-old firefighter from Lincoln , Nebraska , who had long suffered from arthritis in his knees . Four years ago , the pain and swelling became so severe that he could not comfortably support the heavy bunker gear and the oxygen tank that he had to wear in order to enter a blaze and do his job . His leisure activities , too , were curtailed : more than an hour of driving caused his knees to balloon and stiffen . Dr. Arthur Weaver , a rheumatologist , diagnosed the most common form of arthritis , termed osteoarthritis . Over time , wear and tear abrades the smooth surface of the joints ; the trauma generates prostaglandins ; and  --  in that characteristic vicious cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worsens the abrasion . Dr. Weaver finally prescribed Voltaren , which is a strong NSAID . " It did n't upset my stomach , " Dillon told me . " I have a strong constitution . It just did n't help enough . " He 's one of those arthritis patients for whom NSAIDS are limited not by their side effects but by their impotency . <p> About two years ago , Dillon entered a clinical trial of Celebra . " It 's been tremendous , " he says , with undisguised enthusiasm . He has had no side effects from the treatment and has enjoyed sustained improvement in his knees . He can now do his job without pain . Still , he points out that if he misses a single dose , within a day he notices a return of pain and reduced flexibility in his joints . The study Dillon is enrolled in ends in two years ; his greatest worry is that if the drug does n't gain FDA approval by then , he may have to go back to the kind of life he had before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dose of Celebra : Monsanto initially proceeded cautiously in its clinical trials , seeking to establish the drug 's safety and efficacy before exploring its upper reaches . But with efficient COX-2 inhibitors , clinicians may be able to address one of the most vexing scientific questions concerning arthritis : If you could reduce inflammation enough , would a joint be able to heal permanently ? Should this prove to be the case , COX-2 inhibitors may represent far more than symptomatic relief . They may offer a means of modifying the underlying disease itself . Potent inhibition of COX-2 also opens up the possibility that noxious and addictive narcotics , like codeine and Percocet , could be superseded  --  and there 's been support for this in clinical trials of Celebra for dental pain . ( It 's noteworthy that American Home Products , which recently announced plans to merge with Monsanto , makes Advil , an ibuprofen-based pain reliever that Celebra may ultimately render obsolete . ) <p> Excitement about COX-2 inhibitors is growing even among cancer researchers . Several studies published during the past decade have indicated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colon cancer . But only recently have scientists figured out why this might be . Most colon cancer is believed to arise from two sequential mutations . The primary mutation causes levels of COX-2 in the cells to soar , which results in excessive growths called polyps . A second mutation can then cause a polyp to become cancerous . It stands to reason that inhibiting cox-2 would block the first step of the process , and there 's now evidence of this in studies of mice specially bred to have the primary mutation . These mice are prone to develop precancerous polyps , but when they 're given Celebra , such polyps never develop and cancer never gets started . Clinical trials of Celebra as a cancer preventive are already under way in people who have multiple colonic polyps and are at high risk for colon cancer . <p> Philip Needleman thinks the results of these trials will mirror what has been seen in the mice . He readily admits that mice are not men , but there is now hard science to explain the reported link between NSAIDS and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cox-2 may play a role in other kinds of cancer as well . Researchers are hastening to analyze tumor specimens for the enzyme , and there are indications that breast cancer is also promoted by cox-2 . <p> Alzheimer 's disease is another debilitating malady for which cox-2 blockers are being tested . When I asked Needleman why blocking cox-2 might help , he replied , " Ver veyst ? "  --  Yiddish for " Who knows ? "  --  and added , " Ask your neighbor Cliff Saper . " <p> Clifford Saper is a professor of neuroscience at Harvard and a prominent figure in the biology and treatment of Alzheimer 's disease . Saper told me that there have been 14 published studies on NSAIDS and Alzheimer 's disease which showed a significant decrease in the progression of the disease when NSAIDS are used . Saper had been tracking the research , and he and Needleman talked about it . " At the time , everyone was focused on arthritis , " Saper said . " But when Phil is struck by an idea , nothing can stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> How might a cox-2 inhibitor be helpful in treating Alzheimer 's ? Saper points out that when a neuron in the brain is damaged , an inflammatory reaction occurs , but that  --  as happens with arthritis  --  this inflammation can itself cause more damage . Celebra , he said , promises to " break open the vicious cycle of inflammation in Alzheimer 's . " A national study of Celebra is under way , with more than 300 patients who have mild to moderate Alzheimer 's disease . Saper says he expects to find that the drug slows the rate of cognitive deterioration by at least 50 percent . <p> The potential market for cox-2 inhibitors is enormous . Analysts have projected sales of up to five billion dollars a year in the United States . ( Prozac , by comparison , has sales of two billion dollars . ) Monsanto is seeking initial FDA approval only for the treatment of arthritis . But Celebra is likely to have considerable " off-label use "  --  as physicians use it to replace narcotics for relief of moderate pain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when conventional NSAIDS can cause uncontrolled bleeding . And if Celebra should eventually prove to be a safe way of preventing colon cancer and slowing Alzheimer 's disease , the sales would be stratopheric . The total market could easily exceed ten billion dollars yearly in the United States alone . <p> Given these figures , the arrival of Celebra , which represents not merely a new drug but a new category of drugs , has invited fierce competition . Merck , a formidable opponent to Monsanto , has already completed advanced clinical trials of a cox-2 inhibitor of its own , called Vioxx . The development of both Vioxx and Celebra required screening tens of thousands of compounds in tedious test-tube assays . A second generation of cox2 inhibitors will take advantage of recent developments in computerized drug design . Computers can now assess how different chemical structures fit into the nooks and crannies of the cox-2 molecule . It turns out that there are subtle but important differences between the surfaces of cox-1 and cox-2 : the latter enzyme has a so-called side pocket , into which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Needleman has confirmed that Monsanto 's computer analysis of the cox-2 molecule has already yielded a " son of Celebra , " or second-generation inhibitor . Celebra has a thousandfold propensity to block cox-2 over cox-1 ; the new compound 's selectivity is 42,000-fold . <p> But could there be a third cox enzyme ? Sir John Vane has recently speculated that there might be such an enzyme , which could mediate pain and fever rather than inflammation . " I look every day at new gene sequences in the database , " Needleman told me , referring to the growing repository of DNA codes that have been deciphered . He is seeking similarities between recently discovered genes of unknown function and the known gene sequences of cox-1 and cox-2 . So far , he has n't seen any evidence of a cox-3 , nor has anyone else , as far as we know . But when the stakes are this high , scientists and their companies are constantly in a state of restless vigilance . " What you do n't know worries you , " Needleman admits . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years I wo n't have to do this to you , " Lee Simon said as he injected my elbow with cortisone ; I 'd banged it a couple of weeks earlier and had developed bursitis . <p> Dr. Simon , a colleague of mine at Harvard , works on innovative treatments for arthritis . He helped design the Celebra trials , and was one of the organizers of the First International Workshop on cox-2 , which was held in New Orleans this past September . He 's known in the field for having a sharply critical attitude toward most of the new therapies being touted for inflammation . Over the new decades of his career , he has seen many false starts and has developed an ingrained wariness . So I was startled by his assessment of the new cox-2 inhibitor . <p> " Celebra is incredible , " he said , and went on to point out that more than 10,000 patients have received the drug  --  many , like Rich Dillon , for more than a year  --  and no side effects have been observed . " None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lengths to which he and others have gone to look for toxicity  --  even peering right into people 's stomachs via endoscopy . Take a handful of aspirin , and you 'll start to hear ringing in your ears , but in studies of animals that are much more sensitive to cox inhibition than people are , researchers had to administer an amount of Celebra that was at least a hundred times as great as the therapeutic dose before any side effects began to appear . Twenty percent of a group of people taking naproxen ( the active ingredient of Aleve ) had developed gastric ulcers after only one week of treatment ; none of those taking Celebra had . Investigators had also isolated platelets from Celebra-treated patients and found the cells to be unaffected . The clinical trials in dental pain , rheumatoid arthritis , and osteoarthritis had proved that Celebra significantly and powerfully alleviates pain and , in arthritis , also improves the range of joint motion . <p> " It seems too good to be true , " I told Lee Simon . Clinical investigators always have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinded by the love of your hypothesis , to scant the counter-evidence the way a parent overlooks the misbehavior of a child . Simon conceded that the clinical experience is still limited in time : no one has taken a cox-2 inhibitor every day for decades . But so far all the signs are good  --  and for people like me , they are more than good . I imagine myself , in the year 2000 , popping a pill , comfortably bending down to tighten the laces of my sneakers , and beginning the 26 miles from Hopkinton to Boston . <p> <p>
