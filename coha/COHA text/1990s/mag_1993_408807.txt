Or , if you cuss in English , Ouch ! The Big Pinch squeezed the world 's 500 largest service companies last year even more tightly than in 1991 . Total profits fell by 17% and 62 of the companies  --  ten more than in the previous year-recorded losses . For the second year in a row the biggest money loser was Deutsche Bundesbahn , a German railroad company . It lost $5.3 billion . To assemble such numbers . we divide the world 's biggest service corporations into eight categories : diversified services , commercial banks , diversified financial companies , savings banks , life insurers , retailers , transportation companies , and utilities . We rank them by sales , revenues . assets , depending on industry practice . By using figures for fiscal years ending as recently as this past March , we give you as up-to-date as possible a picture of the world at business today . For all the record losses , that picture includes bright spots . American Telephone &; Telegraph , for example , roared to a record profit of $3.8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Mexico ( $2.5 billion ) , British Telecom ( $2 billion ) , Bell South ( $1.6 billion ) , and Nippon Telegraph &; Telephone ( $1.3 billion ) . Certainly something for stockholders to call home about . Another category that thrived : savings banks . Their profits rose 20.4% overall , partly because of tighter lending practices . But what happened to the less fortunate ? Deutsche Bundesbahn blames higher labor costs and interest rates . Global jitters about the economy hurt most companies , but mauled retailers . Hangovers from bad real estate loans still numbed commercial banks . And acts of God like catastrophic volcanoes lambasted insurers . Sears Roebuck , the second-biggest loser ( $3.9 billion ) , took several direct hits , including corporate restructuring costs , new accounting rules  --  and Hurricane Andrew , which battered its Allstate insurance subsidiary . International competition cost most big airlines . Doubtless their crews knew just what the Japanese business traveler  --  likely an employee of a money-losing investment bank  --  meant when he exclaimed , " Maittanaa !
