Today Cindy , the social worker , told us that depression is anger turned inwardslike we had n't heard that a thousand times before-and she had us try to get in touch with our anger using batakas , bright blue bats made of foam with cutlass handles , made us beat them on the floor while we shouted out our rage , and I thought what a stupid exercise , if we did n't already look like lunatics we do now , so I got in a sword fight with Johnny O. instead , the two of us jumping from chair to chair , whacking at each other with our batakas until Johnny O. , who 's six-two , two hundred and fifty pounds , knocked over the pottery wheel and broke it . Then Cindy got all pissed off because of the wheel and because she does n't want us doing anything that cathartic , we might accidentally have fun which is not at all the point of a psychiatric hospitaljust look at the doctors ' faces , they look angry themselves ; I would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , of course , I do n't say that because everything you say here is caught like a rat and dissected . <p> I 've been at Sunrise fourteen days including my birthday and St. Patrick 's Day and except for the touchy-feely exercises , I ca n't say I mind it , though I was scared at first because when they brought me into the locked ward the first patient I met had electrodes all over his head , a twenty-four-hour EEG it turned out but I did n't know that then . They still do a lot of ECTs at these places and even though Sunrise has a good reputation , there 's nothing preventing them from putting six hundred volts through my brain or pumping me full of Thorazine if they want to . So I do what I 'm told , take my meds , try not to get too excited about things , because even though they want you to express your emotions , when you do they get angry or scared , even if you do it in the Sunrise Approved Method of Emoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiencing feelings of extreme anxiety right now . I respect your authority as a doctor but I suffered a traumatic event as a child and would feel more comfortable if you took your finger out of my butt " - that kind of thing . And if you do n't stop expressing your emotions when they ask you to , you 're " acting out " and they lock you in the isolation room , or shoot you up , or both . Johnny 0 . got both but that 's because he broke the doors down and made them chase him down to the bus stop ; they had to bring him back in restraints , crying like a baby-he 's really nothing more than a big baby , gives me hugs all the time which I do n't like but they mean a lot to him so I do n't say anything-and then they shot him up and stuck him in the isolation room for a day and a half . When he came out he was smiling and laughing , thanking them like they 'd done him a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to knock you down , to tell you how misguided you are , how your perceptions are skewed . Like my shrink , Doctor Sispan . She 's Indian or Pakistani , I do n't know which , but she 's short and bowlegged and she talks as if every consonant in the English language is pronounced like a b or a p . After I got through telling her how my wife was fooling around with an editor at Rolling Stone , how I 'd lost my job , how my dog had been swept under a street-cleaner , she told me , " This narcissism has got to stop , Alan , " as if it 's narcissistic to be upset about your marriage , your job , your dog . Like they do n't matter . Maybe they do n't in India ; I do n't know . I thought of saying " My sacred cow died , " thought maybe she could understand that , but what difference would it make ? <p> My first day in the locked ward , the duty nurse had this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny , barely five feet , with limp black hair tinted purple at the ends and chewed-up fingernails , and she wears kids ' sneakers and even looks a little like a kid though she 's twenty-four and has hips and breasts enough for her size though not much by most men 's standards . It confused the hell out of me because I could n't figure out whether she was a patient or an intern , she seemed too young to be either , though lately I 've noticed a lot of teens in here , which makes sense I guess , since teenagers are walking emotional aneurysms . Anyway , the first thing Susan showed me on her guided tour of Lunatic Central was the supply closet . " If you can get in there you can have all the razors you want , " she said , laughing , and I thought she was pretty far gone , but later , when I got to know her , I realized she just does n't give a shit what people think , likes to make fun of everything and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even says to people who have tried to kill themselves , " Guess you botched that one , huh ? " Johnny 0 . told me she 's been locked up five times , keeps threatening to kill her parents , but when I asked Susan she said it was all bullshit . <p> " I stole my father 's gun and threatened to blow my brains out at breakfast one morning , " she said . " He did n't give a shit whether I killed myself or not , but he did n't want me doing it in front of him . So he grabbed the gun and smacked me in the side of the head with it . Busted my eardrum . " Which is the way it is with familythe first time they 're concerned and understanding ; the second time they 're angry but sympathetic ; the third or fourth time they wish you would just do it and get it over with . This is only my second time , but I felt the ties severing even after the first : friends become afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself up in their bathroom or call them at two in the morning , whining about typical depressive shit : " Nobody loves me , " " I 'm ugly and fat and I just ate a gallon of ice cream , " " I 'll never learn the metric system " - like we 're big leeches that are going to grab onto them and suck the life out of them . It does n't matter if you never once tell them about your suicidal feelings , does n't matter if you go home and sit in your room for days at a time just to recover from the effort of being cheerful when you 're around them , if you wear long-sleeve shirts even in the summer so they wo n't have to look at your scars . The fact is , you 're the tyrannosaurus rex of the emotional kingdom : someday , somehow , you will consume somebody-and it will be whoever 's closest at the time . <p> Doctor Sispan gave me outside privileges last week , which means they trust me enough to let me walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a beeline for the bus , or arrange to have someone pick me up and drive me off to Arizona , or just break into houses and steal women 's clothing . So today I hail a cab and take it to my apartment in Oakland , and I plug in my guitar and wail on Green Day 's " Basket Case , " bouncing across the dog-stained wall-to-wall , ripping through the strings until my knuckles are scraped raw , thinking , let me bring this into the hospital , Cindy , then I 'll get in touch with my feelings . I crank the volume up higher , smack out some twelfth-fret harmonics and launch into " Layla , " when suddenly in walks Denise , my wife , and her Rolling Stone stud-du-jour in knee-length Levis shorts and a ripped Nine-Inch Nails T-shirt-like he 's not forty years old and divorced with a Volvo and a car phone and his legs do n't look like frozen waffle batter . And Denise is wearing baggy shorts and hiking boots , her long blonde hair pulled back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's an ad for springwater . They 've been picnicking together , trying to eat their way back through time , how youthful , how romanticnow I suppose they want to exchange sweat , but lo and behold , the husband has mysteriously come home when everyone thought he was lost in the war , what a tragedy . And Denise has this pained look on her face like I 'm her senile grandfather who 's gotten lost again on his way to the bathroom . <p> " What are you doing here ? " she asks and she tries to hug me but the guitar 's in the way and makes an awful screeching sound , so I put it down and Mr. Geriatric Grunge Rocker has enough sense at least to leave the room so Denise can talk to me , but what is there to talk about ? She 's crying and I 'm apologizing and the whole thing 's a mess , until finally the police show up , Sispan 's winged monkeys come to drag me back , and Denise argues with them , offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and when she keeps arguing they threaten to take her in , so Rolling Stone Man pulls her back and they pile me into the back seat behind the chicken wire and off we go to Sunrise , back to the locked ward , back to Doctor Sispan 's emotional crematorium . <p> I made an ashtray in Arts and Crafts today . It 's shaped like a butt and you have to stick the cigarette in its asshole to use it . Cindy got pissed off and made me leave . I do n't know what they did with the ashtray , but it 's the same old story anyway : art is supposed to bring out our feelings ; art is supposed to get us in touch with our emotions . But the only emotions they want are the little ones , emotions they can hold like hamsters in their hands and stroke and soothe . Well , I do n't have hamster emotions , I do n't have any that fit inside of me . I have to keep them in a garage and truck them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like we 're second-gradersa picture of how we feel now and a picture of how we expect to feel when we get out of Sunrise , and I drew a mouse in a box sitting at a computer for now and a dead mouse in a box for later . I knew what she wanted , but I was so pissed off , her in her nice pleated pants and prissy white blouse , her hair flicked behind her ears , like the whole world was as clean as her clothes , like everything she touched was going to blossom ; the dead were n't just going to come back to life for her , we were going to laugh and sing and live productive lives in meaningful jobs . She had her head in social science heaven and I yanked it down into the dirt : this is who I am , this is who I expect to be , who everyone else will be sooner or later . Because as far as I 'm concerned there are only two reasons anyone in this world can be happy : either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Denise comes to visit today and I can tell she feels bad about last week , but we do n't talk about that . In fact , we do n't talk about anything until I bring up , once again , the subject of divorce . And then she starts crying , like she always does these days , and while we 're talking and crying , crying and talking , I think what a perfect place this is to take care of these things : because if you 're going to cut your own heart out , it might as well be in a hospital , where the doctors can stitch you up afterwards , maybe even give you a new heart , though I doubt their ability to do that-they 're pharmacists , not surgeons . They 're more likely to give me a drug to forget I had a heart , forget I ever needed one , and if I stay on that drug for the rest of my life , I 'll be fine , not happy , just fine , until by some miracle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , or just roll over and die . And as I am talking to Denise that is exactly what I want to do , roll over and die-because it is the easiest thing to do , the least painful , because I ca n't reconcile the happiness I feel in being with her and the anger that she 's abandoned me and the fear that she still wants to hold onto me . Because I am afraid that even now we both will want to hold onto each other , that we will slip into another four years of marital rot because it is easier than getting divorced , or because Mr. Rolling Stone has scared her and she wants to get back to something safe , or because trying to kill myself has scared me and I want to return to what I know-that we will scramble back to barren rock and count ourselves lucky that we have something to cling to . <p> Denise has brought me a present , wrapped in Doonesbury paper , with a ribbon and sprig of lilac tied to it . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and fragile-looking , no more than a neck with a tiny balalaika body and a three-inch sound hole , but loud enough to hear , so I start strumming the chords to " Tangled Up in Blue " and she laughs , and I think of the time I serenaded her outside her window in college at three in the morning , how angry she was though she would n't tell me why , how only recently have I come to understand that it was not my singing , or my playing , or the songs I chose that made her angry , but simply the fact that I was not the man she wanted outside her window , that my serenade only confirmed her fear that I would never go away and that there would never be anyone else out there for her , that she had to accept this finally or make changes she could not contemplate making . So she settled-and maybe I settled , too , though this is harder for me to understand because she has always been everything to me . Even now when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about divorce , I feel that she 's everything , though I 'm aware that I must be angry with her , that I must love her and hate her as much as she loves and hates me . But those feelings are not there ; they 've been checked out of the library , and the only way I know they exist is there 's an empty slot where they 're supposed to be . <p> I brought the guitar to Cindy 's class today and she let me play it and everyone sang songs , including Cindy . She has this high soprano voice and as soon as I started in on the Joan Baez songs she let loose and there was no holding her back . We sang Beatles songs and Dylan and Simon and Garfinkel songs , with Johnny 0 . and Susan putting in some harmonies , and anyone passing by would have thought it was a meeting of the Campfire Girls , until Johnny 0 . started singing " Big Ten-Inch Record , " which turned Cindy ten shades of pink and made her announce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music made us feel , only I did n't want to stop playing so I kept strumming until finally Cindy took the guitar away and I walked out . <p> Later , I tried to get Sispan to get my guitar back for me , but she told me that it was a disruptive force . All the other patients like it , I told her , but she said I 'm not here to entertain the other patients and , in any case , things like that are n't allowed on the locked ward , and then my fifteen minutes were up . Sispan had to finish her rounds , get back to what she 'd really rather be doing , juicing rats down in the basement , slicing paper-thin segments of their brains off with a microtome and comparing those with Prozac to those without , though the damn rats would n't need Prozac if they 'd just let them go . But that 's the history of psychiatry : " First , do no good . " <p> Dinner tonight is pork chops with french fries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit next to Susan and between the two of us we eat nine bowls of the chocolate , but she wo n't even look at the rice pudding , says it looks like sperm , which it does . I like Susan . She 's pretty and funny and she 's got more balls than any woman I 've ever met . The other day , as we were waiting for the evening wrap-up session , twenty of us in plastic chairs in the rec room , she leaned over to me and said , " I 'm so horny . If I do n't get out soon , I might have to fuck my doctor , " which sent the soda I 'd been drinking spraying out my nose . And then , last night , I had a dream about her : we were in the shower together and I hoisted her up onto my dick and we were going at it like dragonflies , only just as I was about to come I woke up instead , like I always do , but still it was good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on anti-depressants is like a day without windchill in Antarctica . Only now I ca n't stop looking at her , ca n't get her off my mind , though she 's not really my type . I tend to go for the tall , emaciated ones , the female versions of no-pest strips that do n't do anything except stand there and look beautiful while all these stupid guys cling to them , poisoning themselves on a diet of love . I was in love with Denise , never loved anyone more , but now here I am getting my emotional dialysis , detox for the soul , shrinks tapping into my brain and draining all the poison out , though what good does it do , really , when you ca n't live with the stuff and you ca n't live without it ? " Black and white thinking , " Doctor Sispan would say , but that 's what life is-black and white , ones and zeroes , synapse and soul battling it out , each one claiming the other is the disease . Some days you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These days , I ca n't do either , but what difference does it make ? I 'm just a hole in the ground , a place where a person used to be , a grave in reverse , the real methe me that this hole commemorates-gone somewhere else , though everyone gathers around this hole anyway , pokes and prods thinking that I am still in here . Doctor Sispan , Doctor of Holes , fills me with dirt , with paper , with medicine , whatever she thinks will work , though she never understands that this is only cosmetic , that a hole remains a hole as long as its heart is missing . But she keeps shoveling her shit into me anyway , hoping that by the time I leave I 'll be ready to grow some grass , sprout a few trees , let people walk all over me , and I keep shoveling it back out , knowing that this is not what I want inside of me , that maybe what I really want is for everything inside of me to disappear . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chart today , but I was n't in the mood to play along . On the Rorschach Test , I told her the blot that 's supposed to look like two ice-skating Santa Clauses looked like my mother screwing the pope in the Teacup Ride at Disney World . On the Borrti Test , I answered " true " to " Sometimes I think I have been possessed by the devil , " " I possess mystical powers , " and " My thoughts are being broadcast so that other people know what I am thinking . " Then she showed me some pictures and asked me to make up stories about them , and I went on for twenty minutes about how the farmer in the picture was a deserter from the Israeli army , that he had run off with the pregnant woman , who had been Yassir Arafat 's barber but went AWOL because she never had anything to do , that the pregnant woman was now having an affair with the other woman in the picture , who was really a man in disguise , or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know was that a huge radioactive meteor lay underneath the field and all the cells in their bodies were slowly mutating and the baby would be born with an extra brain , which it would first use to bring peace and love to the earth but eventually would turn to evil when its parents were executed by the Mossad . <p> Afterwards , Doctor Sispan asked me , " Do you think you are mentally ill , Alan ? " And I said , " Do you ? " <p> And she said , " I think you have a lot of anger . And you are very imaginative . But perhaps you wish to be more than this ? " Yes , Doctor ; I 'm dying to be filled with Haldol and stumble around like a constipated vegetable for the rest of my life . What could be better ? But I did n't say this . <p> Denise comes straight from school today , her leather bag bulging with Easter cards her second-graders have made for her . She seems down , so I tell her about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though she wants me to get help , she thinks the doctors here are jokes , children in oversized armor clanking their way through the mazes of the mind . And then she shows me a card one of the kids made , a lopsided bunny trying to hatch an egg , only she starts crying again and I do n't know what to do , so I just sit there like an idiot , until finally she fishes around in her bag for a Kleenex and says , " I broke up with Sean , " which comes as a surprise to me . I thought she was ready to marry the guy , ready to pop out a couple of Rolling Clones , buy the house , do the upscale suburban thing . <p> I ask why and she says , " My husband 's in a mental hospital and I 'm having an affair . I ca n't talk to my friends . I ca n't talk to my family . I ca n't even look at myself anymore , " which is not a surprise , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Have an Affair , " and the fact that she did says more about me than about her , because , after all , it was n't Denise who bailed out first , was n't her who started this mess , though everyone will look at the situation and say , " He went into the hospital and she jumped into the arms of another guy , " which is kind of true . But it 's truer to say , " He took a razor and wrote in blood , ' I do n't care enough about you to stick around , " ' and she went and found someone else , had to , because it was too much to take alone , too much to be alone , the way some people , after losing a partner , fall into bed and it has nothing to do with being glad the person is gone , nothing to do with sex , but just that to lose one 's partner is to lose one 's intimacy with the world , and no one wants to be that isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We love each other , Alan , " Denise says . " Why is n't that enough ? " I know what she is saying : it feels as if we are being punished , as if new rules were imposed while we were asleep and suddenly it 's no longer enough to love each other ; marriage is about some other mysterious element that we have never seen and no one will tell us about . I hold her and she cries on my shoulder and I feel as if I want to cry , but there is no understanding between my feelings and my actions , no treaty has been worked out . I get nothing when I am upset , tears when I am feeling fine , nausea when I am angry , laughter when I am nervous-the whole thing a giant bureaucratic battle between my brain and body , each doing its best to screw the other . <p> Denise lifts her head , wipes her tears with the back of a wrist and says , " I do n't want a divorce , " words I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is she talking about love or something else-fear of the unknown , fear of what she might become in the eyes of her friends and family , of herself , if we get divorced ? Or has she just decided that " in sickness . . . " is the best she can hope for from our vows ? But even if she wants to be the Mother T eresa of matrimony , I do n't want to be her leper . Tell me you love me , I want to say to her . Tell me you ca n't live without me , that I am , even after all we have been through , the person who makes you happiest . Tell me I am not a burden , not your cross to bear . Tell me that you want me , that I excite you , that making love with me is not something you endure but a gasp of air in a submerged world . But she is already pushing away , saying to me , " We belong together . We fit together well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shoe , as if love is the same thing as comfort , as if we had not , in all these years , missed the difference . <p> I am out of the locked ward , finally . A busload of crazies came in over the weekend and they needed the beds , so Doctor Sispan transferred Susan and Johnny O. and me over to the unlocked ward , but I do n't really care . My conversation with Denise has left me angry and depressed . I feel the hospital like a yellow haze in my brain , a flickering , fluorescent smog that 's choking any sanity I might have had , and if somebody set fire to the building right now , I 'd lie down in the middle of the floor and go to sleep , pray that some stupid fireman minded his own business and limited his heroics to rescuing all the buxom screaming nurses , people with a healthy fear of death , people who , if the fireman said to them , " I can take you out of here but you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would answer , " Take me out of here . " Of course , there 's nothing standing in my way if I really want to die , so if I 'm still here it means I 'm either incredibly incompetent or I do n't really want to die . But I feel like I do , and it 's that persistent misery , the unending quality of it , that makes it hard to imagine I will ever have anything better to look forward to . Denise watches me go through my contortions and wonders how I can get that way , how anyone could be so miserable for so long . She has been depressed herself now and then , but it is a different thing , an experience that is upsetting but not crippling because she knows it will pass-the cycle broken because it knows it can be broken ; whereas I am a victim of my own perpetual feedback loop-hopelessness born out of paralysis , out of experience , misery increasing harmonically until I have faith in nothing but the unbreakable noise of the soul : kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a " living sculpture " today , meaning we all had to compose ourselves into something that represented how we feel about ourselves and how we relate to others , and everyone shuffled around looking for something meaningful : Susan put herself in a chair , a princess on her throne , slouching with her legs spread wide like she could care less , and Johnny O. stood behind her , bouncing up and down , dancing , I guess , though it did n't look like any dancing I 'd ever seen , and this other patient , Philip , curled up like a turtle at Susan 's feet , his knees and forehead and arms all drawn in tighter than anyone could imagine possible . I watched the sculpture come together , everyone finding some position , but I could n't think what to do and did n't want to do anything , until finally I was the only one left , and Cindy and the others were calling to me to find a place . The more they insisted , though , the less I could think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through me like a razor drawn from head to foot , and I thought I was going to pass out but I did n't , I just stood there , staring at everyone as if they were words on a page and I was dyslexic , until finally Cindy said it was wind-down time and everyone took their seats . Then she called on me first , like she always does , asking me why I had n't joined in , and I did n't want to answer but she kept pushing , so finally I told her it was a stupid exercise , everyone acting out their cliches about themselves- " Look at me , I 'm a turtle ; look at me , I 'm a dancing fool . Let 's all act out our pathology ! " <p> " Acting out our pathology , ' as you call it , can sometimes be helpful , " Cindy said . " It can give us insight into how we feel about ourselves . " " Oh , we 're getting a lot of insight here , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make nice little ashtrays and pictures . Get in touch with your nice little selves . " <p> Then Johnny O. and one of the other patients , Belinda , started crying , and the others got pissed off at me and told me to shut up-all except Susan , who was laughing-and pretty soon Cindy had her hands full what with all the crying and yelling and arguing going on . So now I 'm banned from Crap &; Wrap and it 's fine by me , I never got anything out of it anyway . <p> At dinner tonight , Susan kept talking about how horny she is , how she misses her boyfriend , even though the asshole has n't called her in nearly a year . I did n't pay much attention because Susan always talks like that , but then as we were walking back to the elevator , she whispered in my ear , " Do you want to do it ? We can go outside . No one will see us . " And even though it had been months since I had even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dreaming about Susan constantly , I was n't sure I really wanted to take the risk . But Susan grabbed my arm and dragged me out into the big wooden stockade that hides the central air-conditioning fans and the power connections , and then she started unzipping my pants and I tried to kiss her , but she would n't let me ; she pressed her face into my chest instead and took out my penis , which was rock hard , and started rubbing it , and I unzipped her pants and started rubbing her , but then I got this panicky feeling : I did n't know why she wanted me , did n't know if she really wanted me or just something , anything , and then I felt the noise and heat of the AC fans rushing over me and my dick started going soft and I wanted to get away but Susan was holding me so tight I could n't breathe , making all these noises , and at first I thought she was coming , but then I realized she was crying , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if I had raped her , even though it had n't been my idea , was n't my fault , though maybe it was . I should have said no . I could have . But I was lonely and frustrated , ready for someone , anyone , to say , " I want you , " even if that person did n't know what she was doing . <p> I zipped up her pants and mine and I managed to get us back to the floor , but as soon as she got to her room , she went berserk-screaming and throwing things , tearing the sheets off her bed , ripping her clothes , scratching at her arms . The nurses came running in , but she escaped into the bathroom and jammed the door and by the time they came around the other side , she was lying in the shower with the water on , beating her fists against her head . <p> I went back to my room and lay on my bed , feeling dried out , desiccated-some four-thousand-year-old shell of a human being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any human life . This is how I have bungled my way through every relationship , how I have hurt those I least wanted to hurt . Because I have no idea how people work , what goes on in their minds . They are spheres bouncing and rolling past me and every attempt I make to connect with them , to look inside , only creates another collision . And some are hard and impenetrable and they knock me down , some are tough and rebound away , but a lot of them are fragile and when we touch , they crack open , and what I find inside is not the person I was looking for but my own violent self , anger and aggression and selfishness spilling back onto me like a broken yolk . <p> Later , Doctor Sispan asks me what happened , and I am not sure at first whether she is referring to Susan or arts group , so I say , " I do n't know . " But she smacks her pencil down on the table and says , " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not return to the floor after dinner . When you did finally return , Susan suffered a very bad reaction . Now I want to know what happened . " <p> And now I have that sensation I had when I was a kid , that someone is watching everything I do , that there is no crime , large or small , that I can commit without being caught . My heart compresses in on itself , tries to make itself small , invisible , and yet I am full of too many things . <p> Doctor Sispan waits for an answer , but when she does n't get one , she says , " Where did you go ? " <p> " Outside , " I answer , my voice no more than a shoe sliding across the floor . " Where outside ? " she asks . " To the stockade , " I say . " And what did you do there " But I ca n't answer this question . The words are barbed and pulling them out will mean pulling myself out , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and when I do n't answer , she says , " Do you know that Susan is a very sick woman ? Do you know that ? " <p> I nod my head , though I am not sure I knew this before today . I am not sure I knew anything about her , other than the fact that she is small and pretty and funny , that I was attracted to her and she was attracted to me , though , knowing what I do now , I can see that it was not attraction but something much more dangerous , the pull of dark starless fields inside of us . <p> " Did you have sex with her ? " Doctor Sispan says . " No , " I say , shaking my head , but I start to cry then and can not stop myself I confess the whole thing to Doctor Sispan and she watches and listens without expression , questioning me , probing for every detail , and I feel that she does not believe me , that no matter how much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all as a lie . You raped this poor defenseless girl is what she will think , and though this is what I think , too , though this may be the ultimate truth , it is not all of the truth . <p> " I did n't do anything , " I say to Doctor Sispan . But I do n't even believe myself . Later that night , Doctor Sispan comes back and when we are seated in the conference room , she says to me , " You are a very lucky man , Alan " - like that , as if I have won the lottery or something . " Susan shows no signs of intercourse or injuries . And she denies being with you . " <p> " I told you that , " I say . <p> " I believe you , " Doctor Sispan says . " But do you understand , Mr. Salter , that there are people here whose needs far outweigh their perceptions ? Do you realize that each patient in this hospital is here for a reason , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would advise you to look around . Perhaps by the time you leave , you will understand what I mean when I say you are a very lucky man . " <p> Denise is in today . We are meeting with Doctor Sispan and I am not sure what the point is , except that Denise is not willing to give up yet . We sit across from each other , a colloquium of two , ready to present our papers , engage in lively debate , parry and thrust in the name of better communication and understanding while the moderator , Doctor Sispan , watches for hidden knives , guns , agendas . Denise looks anxious , a woman who has returned to her family after months in space and is not sure what she will find . But she is eager to get on with things . <p> " What 's hard for me , " Denise says , " is not knowing who I 'm going to be with from day to day . " She talks about me in the third person , like that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this is a parent-teacher conference and I am the second-grader not working to his potential . " He 's fine when he 's on his medication , but then he goes off of it and the whole thing starts up again . " <p> How long would you stay on a drug that makes you gain forty pounds , turns your shit to bricks , your mouth to sandpaper , gives you the sex drive of a geriatric slug , I want to say , but it 's not my turn to speak yet . And anyway I recognize that tone in Denise 's voice , the " we can resolve this " syndrome , gut-level philosophy based on her firm belief that if she works hard enough at something , she ca n't fail , has never failed , though she forgets that I have failed at everything in my life , that my one great success is to be a complete fuck-up . And in the physics of this universe , stars and black holes do n't cancel each other out ; one swallows the other whole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Sispan asks me finally . " I ca n't see how things are going to change , " I say , which clearly upsets Denise . <p> " How can you say that ? " she says . " You make it sound so hopeless . " Which is true . But if I had any hope , we would n't be here . And even if I am willing to try , I know things wo n't change overnight , so what do we do in the meantime ? I 'll try to be less dysfunctional and Denise will try to be more patient , but if two weeks from now she comes home and finds me lying on the couch again , staring at nothing , what will she do ? How many relapses am I allowed before she starts getting cold and distant again ? How many times can I stand to have her push me away before I want to kill myself all over again ? <p> " I 'm depressed , Denise , " I say . " That 's the way I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body settling over me , a crumpled , airless bag with no holes , no opening , and I would like nothing better than to curl up inside myself and go to sleep . <p> But Denise gives me a look of pure hatred , says to me , " No . It 's the way you want to be , Alan , " and as she stares at me through red , tearing eyes , I feel the whole discussion has become a titanium Gordion knot , something that I ca n't cut or unravel , and part of me wants to shove the whole thing back in her face , say , " If you can figure it out , be my guest ; I do n't care , " but the other part of me knows that she is right , that my sickness and my life are intertwined in a way that is as much habit as it is dysfunction , that even though the cords were cut long ago , I am still stumbling around like a bound man . Even now I feel myself ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Sispan are in charge and that whatever I say is just a paper wrap over what I really want , that to them I am just a box of boxes , and no matter how many times I tell them , " This is me , " they will say , " Oh no , you came from that box , " or " No , there 's another one inside you , " and they will proceed to tear me open or close me up , do whatever it takes to form me into the size and shape they need , until I am left with nothing but this image of myself , a container that would be completely empty if not for their good graces . <p> " Why do you want to keep doing this ? " I say to Denise . And she says , " Because I love you , " as if I am a man standing on a ledge and she is the devoted wife who has come to convince me that it really is a wonderful lifeexcept , of course , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another man , and when she said it to him , it probably had the same meaning it does now : she does not want change . And now , as she 's staring at me , waiting for my answer , I realize suddenly that I may be confused about anger and despair but she is equally confused about love and need , believes that comfort is the same thing as passion , caretaking the same thing as marriage , and that we have never , in all our time together , been husband and wife , only parent and child , each one to the other . <p> So I sit in my boiling , silent sphere , watching Denise and Doctor Sispan press their faces uselessly against the glass , patient and impatient , demanding and dependent , and I know it would be easy to say nothing , to sink back under the current of what 's safe , what 's familiar , and let Denise and me slowly drown in our own marriage . But I do n't want this . There is either more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced there is nothing , I say to Denise-not loud because I am not sure of myself , because I do n't know how to say such a thing , because the words feel dangerous and hurtful and more desperate than anything I have ever said before-I say to her , " I do n't want to . " And she watches me , angry , waiting for more , waiting for the hook , the catch , not realizing that the line is already broken even as Doctor Sispan sighs and lays her pencil down . <p> I meet with Cindy today to see if I am rehabilitated enough to come back to Bore &; Snore . After two weeks on the floor , with nothing to do and no one to talk to , I am ready to eat a little crow . I explain that I was just upset by the whole sculpture exercise , I did n't mean to disrupt the class . <p> " You should have said something , " Cindy says . " We ca n't read your mind . " But she lets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been through in the past two weeks , I ca n't say I 'm not glad , especially as the hospital has finally gotten a new pottery wheel to replace the one Johnny O. broke . I 've never " thrown " clay before , but it 's always looked soothing , like running your fingers along a slick , spinning breast , which is exactly what Johnny O. makes , only with a thin hole in the nipple so he can use it as an incense burner when he goes home . Philip surprises everyone by making this perfectly sculpted pitcher with a lip and a handle , and Belinda manages to carve out a wobbly fruit bowl . Then it is my turn and I throw the biggest lump of clay I can fit onto the wheel and wet my hands . But when the wheel starts spinning I find that it 's hard , in fact , to shape clay , and just as I 'm about to take the lump and throw it across the room , Cindy , who is sitting opposite me , puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this . " Only I do n't want her touching me , do n't want the pressure of her pity-filled , mothering fingers , so I shrug her off and throw myself at the clay again , feeling it spinning under me , twisting , bending , growing into something I can not picture . <p>
