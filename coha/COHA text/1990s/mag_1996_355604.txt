Pity the poor beleaguered cable guy . Direct-broadcast satellites are eroding his turf from the air while the Baby Bells and the burgeoning Internet creep in over the phone system . Worse still , he faces this growing competition while trying to shake a public image only a bit more benign than Saddam Hussein 's . <P> The cable empire is finally striking back . Its secret weapon : blisteringly fast access to the Internet , courtesy of the cable modem , an electronic gadget that connects computers to the outside world via cable-TV lines instead of phone lines . In the past two weeks , America 's two largest cable operators , TCI and Time Warner , launched the nation 's first commercial cable-modem services in Fremont , California , and Akron , Ohio , respectively . Time Warner built its own service , dubbed Road Runner ( after Warner Bros. ' lightning-speed cartoon character ) ; TCI joined forces with a Silicon Valley start-up called @Home . The basic pitch , however , is the same : Net access at speeds hundreds of times faster than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch . Weary Netizens know all too well that browsing the World Wide Web these days is less like surfing than like crawling : data drips like molasses onto your computer screen , sometimes taking several minutes to create a single page of text and graphics . If you want to download , say , a 5-minute rock video , you 'll have time to catch a quick meal  --  maybe even a movie  --  while the phone line churns away . <P> Your cable line , by contrast , has enough data-carrying capacity  --  or bandwidth  --  to deliver 60 or 70 channels of live video the instant you turn on the tube . It is , in high-tech parlance , a very fat " pipe "  --  some 300 times as fat as " twisted pair " copper phone lines . What if , the cable industry breathlessly asks , some of that bandwidth could be diverted to the Internet ? How might entertainment and commerce  --  not to mention the industry 's bottom line  --  be transformed ? <P> It is to answer that question that the leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today 's media darling , @Home , which launched last year vowing to build the first national cable-modem network , has exclusive deals with TCI , Cox and Comcast . In addition to its Fremont service , it is readying rollouts with TCI in Hartford , Connecticut , and Arlington , Illinois ; Cox in Orange County , California ; and Comcast in Baltimore , Maryland . " We 're in a frenzy , " says CEO Tom Jermoluk . " We 've got 20 or 30 cities going online . We 'll reach hundreds of thousands of homes very shortly . " <P> Time Warner 's Road Runner service , which began as a small trial in Elmira , New York , is available to 300,000 homes in Akron and neighboring Canton , Ohio , and is set to expand in Elmira and Corning , New York , this year , and to San Diego soon after . <P> The price , for those already paying for Internet access , is probably right . Net users pay at least $20 a month for bare-bones access , and users of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can rack up huge monthly bills . Cable modems , for about $35 a month , not only deliver dramatically faster performance , but also , like cable TV , are " on " 24 hours a day with no extra-usage charge . Time Warner Cable president Glenn Britt says the Akron rollout has a waiting list 1,800 names long .
