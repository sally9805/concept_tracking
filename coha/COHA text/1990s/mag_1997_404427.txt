In the early years of a marriage , you build up trust and goodwill between each other by doing a lot of things and sharing a lot of things . It 's like putting money into a bank account . But when you have a child , you 're not making steady deposits to that bank account anymore . You 're withdrawing an awful lot . And , if you 're not careful , you 'll have an overdraft . " This explanation from John Hunsley , a University of Ottawa psychology professor , hits home with a lot of new parents . It 's not brain surgery : The addition of a child to a couple 's world demands that primary attention be shifted from marital to parental roles . Parents no longer have the same time to devote to their relationship , so it 's frequently shuffled off to the most remote burner on the family stove  --  with no flame lit beneath it . Robert Colby , a Vancouver psychologist , attributes that chilling reality to our education system , which , as he puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reading skills , but it does n't prepare people for being parents , both in the role of parenting and the effect on the relationship . " And as any new parent or parent-to-be knows , it 's just the work involved in rearing a child that gets any airplay in the pregnant and early months . Conversation rarely turns to how the tornadic new addition is going to challenge a couple 's values , their views of themselves , their sense of competence , and their life as a duo . In recent years , a flurry of research studies has feasted upon this phenomenon , and most of them have surfaced with the unhappy news that the belief that children enhance marital quality is unfounded . Having a baby , it seems , is more likely to detract from , rather than add to , relationship satisfaction  --  particularly the satisfaction of the female partner  --  right from day one . " And you ca n't blame the poor baby , " says Sandra Byers , a professor of psychology at the University of New Brunswick and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Still , a great many marriages not only survive the experience , but are enriched by it . So why do some partnerships break down when a child enters the picture , while others embrace the challenge and grow stronger ? Among the most troubled couples , Byers believes , the seeds of discontent are sown long before the baby comes . Some relationships suffer from disastrous communication , a shortcoming that can only worsen with the addition of a baby . " Some couples get along well as long as there are no disagreements , but they do n't know how to communicate when they do disagree . You take that and throw in a baby  --  a situation that adds more stress , more decisions to be made  --  and marriage satisfaction is going to decline . " The key to rising above it all , say the experts , lies in the seemingly simple art of sharing . New parents have got to excel at sharing their thoughts , concerns and anger , as well as sharing the new duties that a baby brings . Robyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in October 1995 ) brought a great gift to her relationship with husband Luciano , in addition to the obvious tangle of challenges . " We 're always complaining about how hard it 's been , " says the Toronto room , " but the most important thing Elise has done for us is help us to realize how well we work together as a team . In the past , the problems we dealt with were either his or mine . Now , through her , they 're ours . It 's up to both of us to instill her with values , teach her to be a good person and sort through her temper tantrums . We recognize how well we 've been able to approach all of this together , and that 's brought us closer . " But most parents-to-be never take the time to contemplate the myriad side effects a baby might have on their relationship , largely because no one ever suggests that they should . The only kind of advice Marion Green ever got before she gave birth to her son Jamie , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was about to give up . Mind you , says Byers , the point about exhaustion is a good one to make , because almost every new parent will experience it . " But I think people are more ready for the sleep deprivation than they are ready to realize that their lives have been fundamentally changed forever . " Green says nobody warned her about the explosion the baby would set off in her relationship with her husband . And nobody told this Halifax room that a child can unearth unpleasant  --  and previously unexhibited  --  characteristics in people . A baby , says John Hunsley , places new demands on people " to find out about areas where you and your partner may have different opinions . You typically choose a spouse based on a number of factors , but those do n't usually include a thorough discussion of child-rearing practices . " When people become parents , they often discover things about their partner that they never knew before , because they were never relevant before . These discoveries represent a whole new realm to be negotiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big arrival . They should explore a range of issues before visiting the maternity ward , including the negative feelings each person harbours about relationships with his or her own parents , the practicalties of arranging their respective work lives post-baby , the " who does what " debate , and the trouble spots in their relationship . If they are both clear on what their expectations are and have already tried to come up with some creative solutions around problems that can be anticipated , " says Byers , " then they 're that much further ahead . " Otherwise , all of this can be a work-in-progress , so long as the couple acknowledges the key word : work . Still , says Colby , the work can be fun if it 's approached in the right spirit . " You have to redefine what is going to be a difficult , frightening  --  for some people , overwhelming  --  task into a shared positive experience . With all the worries , concerns , exhaustion and biological confusion that 's created , you have to remember you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of a day when you could n't get anything done , did n't have time for a shower and were merely able to move the basket of unfolded laundry from one end of the living room to the other , you must sit down with your partner , look at the baby you created and try to enjoy what you have , as a family , together . As Colby stresses , " you have to account for the positives so they do n't slip by you . " But what about finding time for sex in all this psychological effort ? If you 're a new parent for whom sex is infrequent  --  or even nonexistent  --  you 're not alone . Therapists report this issue among the most frequently discussed at their clinics . Morns , with scrambled hormones and not enough sleep , and dads , buckling under added responsibilities and , sometimes , decreased sexual desire , do n't make the most active of sexual partners . Even when couples do have the desire , it 's not that easy to translate into action . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find it , since spontaneity becomes a thing of the past . You might try having sex in places other than the bed , which takes on an exclusive reputation as a sleep haven in the early months of a child 's life . Scheduling " dates " can be effective . And just because you ca n't have it as often as before , the quality of your sex can take precedence over the quantity . But among the principal causes of problems with sex are problems with a relationship . In one common scenario , says Byers , the stay-at-home mom starts resenting her husband because he still gets to see friends , go out for dinner , have private time , etc . The burden weighs heavily on the mother , and she 's exhausted . " Meanwhile , the other partner still thinks they should have sex regularly . He thinks that they have the baby , but everything else should stay as it was , and that becomes a conflict , instead of realizing that , maybe if he did more , they 'd both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joyful presence of five-year-old Kieran and two-year-old Zachary has admittedly put a crimp in his sex life with wife Sandra , but he prefers to look at this as a challenge that 's enjoyable to work through . Besides , says the London , Ontario dad , while children may complicate a couple 's life , they also enhance it . For one , having kids has opened up a whole new world of friendships with other couples who share similarly child-bound lives . And family life overall has improved . " We look forward to family functions now , " says Delamont , " because we realize how important they are to the boys . But we used to think of them as a chore . " Most of all , the addition of children to their relationship has allowed the pair to put things into perspective and recognize where priorities lie . " I do n't get bugged by little things anymore , and neither does she , " Delamont explains . " That 's got to help us as a couple .
