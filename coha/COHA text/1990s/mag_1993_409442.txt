New insights into a dog 's all-important first year reveal ways that you can help a pup get off to a good start . You may have read about Joan Bailey in this column before . Some people know her as the self-proclaimed " Nag of NAVHDA "  --  the push and shove that moved the movers of the early North American Versatile Hunting Dog Association ( NAVHDA ) . Rolf Benseler , president of Klub Deutsch Kurzhaar , U.S.A.  --  the excellent new German Shorthair group  --  introduced Bailey at a judges ' seminar as the Margaret Thatcher of the dog world . He now denies giving her that much scope , claiming instead that he only thought of her as prime minister of hunting dogs . But I 'm afraid he 's too late . Joan Bailey is hard to demote . Not even the stroke she suffered could do it . Those who read my column " Bringing Training Into The ' ' 90s " ( April 1991 ) know of Bailey 's strong-willed determination . She surprised the medical profession and her friends  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet to hunt again behind a Wire-haired Pointing Griffon . She did that for herself . Her latest surprise is for us  --  for everyone in hunting dogs . Bailey told me her plan during a telephone conversation almost three years ago . I did n't want to say that she was crazy , but I did want to suggest she cease drinking soda out of aluminum cans until they prove another cause of Alzheimer 's . Good grief ! She was going to write a book about the first year in a dog 's life ! Friends , I had heard Bailey insist adamantly , time after time , that training should n't begin before the pup is a yearling . To me , that denies the pup its potential . So what 's left to talk about besides that ? Worms ? Germs ? A book is a monumental effort , and who would buy one written about a year of shots , soiled rugs and socialization ! ? Fortunately , I knew that saying , " Do n't write that book , " is like telling someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ugly . I kept quiet . And one day UPS rolled in with a first-draft manuscript that was exactly the opposite of my expectations . Bailey had not neglected the nuts and bolts of puppy rearing , but her principal thrust throughout was " how to help gun dogs train themselves . " I ca n't imagine an idea more attractive to dog owners . Eventually , this phrase became the title of the book . How could Bailey be adamant about not training during the first year , yet write a book about helping a pup train itself during its first 12 months ? Perhaps we writer types can become too fixed in our own word definitions to communicate well . Anyhow , to me , training means anything I do to modify a dog 's behavior . To Bailey , the word " training " is associated with obedience , discipline and pressure , and that 's for the yearling and older . Bailey chooses to call puppy training " conditioning . " I call it " play training . " Once I got our buzz words in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the works . The subtitle is " Taking Advantage of Early Conditioned Learning . " It 's a little like mama coyote taking eight-week-old pups along on short hunts . She does n't yank them by the neck , push down their rumps or yell orders in a foreign language . She simply exposes them to life . Mama knows that the youngsters have canine instincts , and she understands how the pups will react . They learn swiftly at this important time because they 're too young for their own ideas to get in the way . " Conditioning " is more difficult for us than it is for mama coyote . We only know how humans react . We need a book to learn how baby canines react . When we fail to learn this , we send wrong and often conflicting signals . Maybe the retriever puppy delivers a knotted sock . We reach down to pat the dog affectionately on the head . But in the litter , only punishment comes down from above in that manner . The confused pup , taken aback by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to commit that offense again . If the process is repeated often enough , the unsuspecting amateur trainer suppresses his retriever 's willingness to retrieve . Bailey helps the reader avoid the dog/human language barrier by drawing heavily on the works of researchers and animal behaviorists such as Eberhard Trumler , John Paul Scott , John L. Fuller , Edward Bailey and Konrad Lorenz . And she keeps everything in perspective . She does not select bits and pieces and elevate them to articles of religious faith , as writers have in the past . A good example is the 49-day-separation theory . Scott and Fuller did the study that pinpointed seven weeks as the time that pecking orders begin in litters of pups . If badly inhibited by littermates , a pup can carry a feeling of worthlessness with it throughout life . That pup may fear and shrink from all new experiences . A very calm , patient trainer might bring a pup out of its inhibition , but few will try . Without a large investment in time , how do we know whether the problem stems from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur overnight , however . There 's no immediacy at exactly seven weeks . Yet once the word got out , the 49th day was all but written into law . Buyers are still insisting on pups exactly 49 days old . As Bailey points out , the pecking order is n't the only thing happening within the litter . She quotes Ed Bailey and Eberhard Trumler , who say that three to 12 weeks is the critical period for development of the learning process that sets the pattern for relationships with other dogs , humans and places . She prefers to buy a pup that is 10 to 12 weeks old . Another thing happening at this time is that the pup is learning how to learn . Trumler says that curiosity in pups begins at 16 to 18 days . From then through 16 weeks , curiosity and ability to learn accelerate in proportion to how much we challenge the pup 's mind . For that reason , eight to 16 weeks is the most precious period in the pup 's life . The more we expose the puppy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quicker it will learn for the rest of its life . If we own the litter and have chosen a pup , it 's easy to take full advantage of this valuable period . We can expose the eight-week-old pup to conditioning , then plop it right back in the litter . By 10 or 12 weeks , if the pecking order appears to be affecting this pup , we can move the youngster . Bailey prefers to have the pup in the house , where its exposure to life is an ongoing process . And she wisely insists on just one pup . Two will divide her time and attention . And worse , two will continue the preoccupation with pecking order while ignoring her much of the time . If we do n't own the litter , it 's a trade-off . I would n't accept a six-week-old pup , because it definitely has n't yet learned how to get along with other dogs properly . And because I pick a pup by behavior , I do n't worry a lot about the pecking order . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eight-to-16 week time period so highly , I do cheat on Bailey 's 10-to-12-week recommendation . Rather than lose 25 to 50 percent of those short , but mind-accelerating weeks , I select at eight weeks and take my chances with eventual social development . So far I have n't been a loser using this method , but I 'll keep an open mind . As might be expected from people opinionated enough to write books , Bailey and I do not always agree on what techniques are best . I 'm always looking for quicker , more innovative ways to speed up the process . For example , there 's a faster , more convenient way to gun-condition a pup . And allowing youngsters to chase birds to build enthusiasm has to be corrected later . That can be time-consuming . Instead , I prefer Bruce Ludwig 's silent whoa or Jim Marti 's use of stop-to-flush as a basic tool . Bailey tends to employ more traditional methods . But she adds these marvelously nurturing twists . Let me show you what I mean . Say , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up and proudly heads your way . Most trainers will fill the air with a roaring , " No ! " Bailey says , hey , deal with the stinking mess . That pup is trying to please you . You ca n't say that it 's wonderful to bring me the dead bird I want , but a crime to deliver one I do n't want . Maturity will teach the dog the difference without the confusion your interference would cause right now . In the beginning , Bailey does n't use the fetch command , either . She tosses the dummy and encourages a retrieve with an excited , " Get it , " or , " Bring it here . " Remember , this is puppy conditioning . There is no pressure . The pup may suddenly decide not to retrieve this time . If Bailey had said , " Fetch , " the pup would have learned it was n't necessary to comply . Save the fetch command for controlled conditions in later , more formal training . Bailey says , yes , teach a pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pup is completely trained to whoa . That 's in the dog 's second year . Bailey and I differ a tad on birds . I find pigeons extremely useful for retrievers and spaniels of all ages and for pointing pups younger than 16 weeks . When pointing pups learn to trail me to the planted pigeons , I switch to recall quail or maybe flight-restricted pigeons . With the Marti method , dogs can be trained throughout with no other birds but pigeons . Pigeons are easy to keep and raise , and homing to the loft cuts overall training time . Bailey , however , is strong on versatile dogs , admits that they have less pointing instinct than English Pointers and Setters , and correctly advocates only recall quail or wild birds for these dogs . Bailey also makes an intuitive observation that planted birds are traumatized and in shock from being caught , carried , dizzied and planted . Other than lack of blood on feathers , they probably smell like dead birds . Those young dogs without an extremely good pointing instinct  --  and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On this we certainly agree . Dizzied birds of any species are not the best for most pups after 16 weeks . Once again , however , I remind you that How To Help Gun Dogs Train Themselves was not meant to be a training manual for a finished dog . Bailey said that she would deal with that all-important first year , which is often neglected . She said that she would show how exposing the youngster to life in the home and field  --  along with properly guided no-pressure responses from us  --  can have the spring-born pup hunting for the gun by autumn . She has . In fact , many hunters would be satisfied with such a dog if it never learned another thing in its career .
