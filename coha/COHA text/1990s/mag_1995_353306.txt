THE PEOPLE OF JAPAN WELL KNOW THE SHOCK AND FEAR THAT AMERICANS are experiencing as a result of the bombing in Oklahoma City . The sarin-gas attack on the Tokyo subway in March killed 12 people and sickened thousands more , and ever since , a sense of unease has gripped the country . That anxiety deepened last week when terror struck again , this time in Yokohama . <P> Emi Sakamoto , 65 , was walking along the first-floor concourse of Yokohama 's central train station last Wednesday afternoon when she was assaulted by fumes that " smelled like thinner . " They seemed to come from a bag carried by a man in front of her . Another commuter , Kyoko Amano , detected the same odor one floor below and began having trouble breathing . " Oh no , " Amano recalls thinking to herself . " What if this is sarin ? " <P> Turpentine , nail-polish remover , sulfuric acid-passengers reached for a host of comparisons , both sinister and mundane , to describe the mysterious substance that was released at three different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas , which police said was nonlethal but still have not been able to identify , sickened hundreds and provoked a headlong charge out of the station by people holding their noses and shouting " Kusai ! "  --  " It smells ! " <P> The injuries were not serious . Of the 310 people treated for stinging eyes and coughs the first day , 21 were hospitalized and all but six released the next day ; everyone was expected to recover . In the meantime , the military 's special chemical-warfare unit combed the area for clues and evidence . It found none . Then two days later , in a department store beside the station , 27 people began coughing after noticing a funny smell around the third-floor escalators . Again , no evidence was found . <P> The investigation into the sarin attack remains a frustrating endeavor . Police continue to focus on Aum Shinrikyo ( Supreme Truth ) , an apocalyptic religious cult , but so far they have had no success in firmly linking it to the crime . Police have arrested more than 100 Aum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday they took into custody Kiyohide Hayakawa , reputedly the cult 's No. 2 leader , for trespassing in a Tokyo apartment . Unlike Shoko Asahara , Aum 's shaggy-haired leader who went into hiding immediately after the Tokyo killings , Hayakawa was not hard to find . Wearing a suit of lustrous pink ( a shade his boss favors as well ) , he had just finished an appearance on national television before his arrest . On tv he had issued a by now familiar disclaimer : Aum has never manufactured nerve gas , studied biological warfare , amassed guns or engaged in any other illegal activities . <P> With each passing week that contention has looked more and more farfetched . In a series of highly publicized raids , the police have uncovered hidden laboratories , secret decontamination chambers and a trove of toxic chemicals on the sect 's various properties . Police now say it is " almost certain " that the cult has spent the past couple of years assembling all the ingredients needed to produce sarin . <P> The authorities claim to be " approaching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for the attack are brought to justice , it will be a long time before Japan 's sense of calm and security is restored . It 's a feeling of uncertainty Americans may have to get used to as well . <P>  --  By Kevin Fedarko . Reported by Irene M. Kunii/Tokyo
