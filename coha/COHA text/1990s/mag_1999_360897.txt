Call it the first bionic handshake . Last week , when an apparatus resembling the business end of a blender unfurled like lily petals and grabbed an outstretched finger , humanity was officially embraced by one of the world 's first artificial muscles . <P> It was n't exactly a display of super strength . The " grip , " generated by four polymer strips designed to bend in response to electrical charges , was barely noticeable . But that force is more than enough for the individual strips to wipe dust from the windshield of a palm-size rover that NASA and the Japanese space agency isas will use to explore an asteroid in 2003 . " Clearing dust may not seem like a big deal , " says Yoseph Bar-Cohen , a physicist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , who created the muscles . But using old-fashioned gears and motors , he says , would make the wiper mechanism " bigger and heavier than the whole rover . " <P> No wonder the prospect of artificial muscles has NASA , well , pumped . Traditional robots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the limited power supplies on a space probe , and their weight translates into higher launch costs . Bar-Cohen says the components required to construct each strip of artificial muscle cost a total of $200 , need just four volts of power and weigh only a fraction of an ounce . Says Rob Manning , chief engineer for nasa 's Mars Lander missions : " With all of our basketball-sized spacecraft , we 're going to need this kind of technology . " <P> Which is one reason artificial-muscle researchers convened for the first time earlier this month at the International Symposium on Smart Structures and Materials in Newport Beach , Calif . " It 's clear that if we 're going to build little robots that do things , then they 've got to have muscles , " says Paul Calvert , a materials scientist at the University of Arizona . He uses polymer gels to construct " Jell-O jacks , " which resemble the wobbly dessert but are capable of raising and lowering small objects . Agrees Qiming Zhang , an electrical engineer at Pennsylvania State University : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfect muscle materials . " <P> That could change , because the mission to asteroid 4660 Nereus has thrust artificial muscles into the limelight . Whereas human limbs move by contracting and relaxing muscles , Bar-Cohen 's artificial variety bends in response to electricity . Apply a charge to one side of a strip , and ions within the polymer are pushed to the opposite side , effectively lengthening one surface while shortening the other . <P> Bar-Cohen foresees construction of artificial limbs that would allow a human to lift heavy objects the way an ant does . He has already received impassioned letters from disabled patients offering to test the first bionic limbs . But such equipment remains years from reality , because the polymer strips and gels being used for muscles are far too pliant to lift heavy weights . Until a new material is found , says Calvert , " you 've only got to look at your arm to realize how far we have to go . " <P>  --  By Dan Cray              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
