As a lad in Texas in the 1950s , Terrence McNally learned his catechism . But he may never have heard a commandment expressed more fervently than the prayer he has written in his new play , A Perfect Ganesh : <P> " Look ! Attack things with your eyes . See them fiercely . Listen ! Hear everything , ignore nothing . Smell ! Breathe deeper than you 've ever dared . Experience . Be . But , above all , remember . Carve adamantine letters in your brain : ' This I have seen and done and known . ' Amen . <P> " No , above all , feel ! Take my heart and do with it what you will . " <P> That 's fine , reckless advice for any person , any writer . The surprise is that McNally , 54 , took his own dare . He is , after all , best known for the zippy romance Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune ( which became a movie with Michelle Pfeiffer and Al Pacino ) and the funny-poignant Lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles ) . Among his dozens of plays are daft farces ( The Ritz , Bad Habits ) , an Emmy-winning TV play ( Andre 's Mother ) and a clever sitcom ( Mama Malone ) , but nothing so eloquent , capacious and true as A Perfect Ganesh . <P> In Ganesh , at the Manhattan Theatre Club , McNally sends two American women to India because they " heard it could heal " and has them face troubling truths about the cancer of prejudice and privilege inside the nicest people . Guided by the cheerful Hindu god Ganesha , the women learn to recognize the illness and  --  not to cure it , but something harder  --  to live with it . <P> " Terrence has the rhythm of life , " says Chita Rivera , star of two musicals ( The Rink and the current Tony winner Kiss of the Spider Woman ) for which McNally wrote the books . " He 's musical . He writes to the rhythm of the person . If he knows you , he 'll go to the core , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of McNally 's recent plays , sees a flowering in the veteran playwright . " In his earlier work , " he says , " he wanted to write about deep feelings but felt he did n't have the right to do it . Who would have guessed that the acceptance , the healing , the mystical philosophy of India would be so ( fully understood by a man from Corpus Christi ? " <P> In McNally 's Texas family , his father Hubert was a wholesale beverage distributor ; mother Dorothy worked as an accountant . In school , Terrence 's passion was opera . " An Ursuline nun played records for us , " he says , " and I loved it from the start . " He is a noted opera prince  --  a regular panelist on the Metropolitan Opera radio quiz  --  with a huge record collection : " I could never play it all in my lifetime . " From this fascination came his higher- than-camp opera fantasia , The Lisbon Traviata ( 1985 ) , and a play in the works , L'Age d'Or ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters who are rival divas . <P> He worked for a Corpus Christi newspaper on summer vacations from Columbia University ( Phi Beta Kappa , 1960 ) , but was soon disenchanted . " I saw that electronic journalism was the future , " he says , " and I did n't want to be that kind of journalist . I was old-fashioned ; I wrote on a pad . " So he traveled on a grant , started a novel and wrote a play , which got him into the Actors Studio . He worked as a stage manager there too . " I did a lot of moving and sweeping , " he says . " But I also saw how some great professionals worked , how they shaped , rehearsed , rewrote. "
