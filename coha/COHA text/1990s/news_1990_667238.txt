<p> Today 's college football question is tricky : Name one player on No. 3 Texas . <p> Give up ? The 10-1 Longhorns have marched impressively , though largely anonymously , to a Mobil Cotton Bowl date with Miami and shot at the national championship . If they pull it off , they 'll be one of the few teams to be unranked in the first poll and No. 1 in the last one . <p> " Everyone knows the Longhorns are back on top , " said safety Stanley Richard , the team 's lone All-American . " But they do n't know anything about the Longhorns . " <p> Who are these players ? Only Texans might know for sure , because 21 of 22 starters are native sons . <p> - There are twin receivers Kerry and Keith Cash , who , when living with their parents in Japan at age 4 , were in commercials in Tokyo . <p> - There is walk-on kicker Michael Pollak , who spent the spring watching the social upheaval in Europe as an exchange student . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked three field goals in the 17-13 opening win against Penn State . <p> - There is sophomore defensive end Shone Dronett , who hunts alligators and is a budding star as a pass rusher , one of the men who helped destroy Houston 's run-and-shoot . <p> - And receiver Johnny Walker , who had 40 catches and is an outfielder in the Atlanta Braves system . <p> - And quarterback Peter Gardere , whose statistics are yawners except for this one : As a healthy starter , he is 13-2 . <p> They are surprise crashers to the No. 1 party . Upon dumping Penn State in State College , Pa. , Keith Cash - older than Kerry by four minutes - coined the phrase , " We 're gon na shock the nation . " <p> Could T-shirts be far behind ? You often see them now : " Shock The Nation Tour - 1990 . " <p> " The best thing about this year , " Keith Cash said , " is we 're not supposed to be here . The pressure is not on us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell out of everybody . We may be favored by one point ( against Miami ) , but I do n't believe anybody thinks we can win . " <p> A year ago , Texas was suffering its second consecutive losing season for the first time since 1938 . <p> College football without a good Texas team felt strange . In this state , it was tragic . It is not hard to sense the local relief at seeing the Longhorns return to prominence . <p> " It 's put the excitement back in our lives , " men 's athletic director DeLoss Dodds said . <p> Not to mention what it 's done for coach David McWilliams , who was handed a five-year contract by the university president in the locker room after the Cotton Bowl-clinching victory against Baylor . <p> He is a Texas boy , so they love him here - as long as he does n't lose too often to A &M.; His father was captured by the Germans in World War II . His mother died suddenly in the early 1960s , just as her son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas . He was an assistant here for 16 years , had one good season as head coach at Texas Tech , then returned in 1987 to a program beginning to show cracks . <p> Then the storm broke . <p> After a reasonable 7-5 his first year , the Longhorns slumped to 4-7 and 5- 6 . Hard times had hit Texas , and having a born-and-bred Longhorn in the coach 's chair had to hurt . <p> " There was no soul-searching about whether I wanted to be here , " he said . " But about what more I could do . There was a little more pain those two years because I came from this program . But there 's been a little more satisfaction at seeing it turn around . " <p> Was McWilliams in trouble ? <p> " I 'm not going to say you never think about it , " he said . " You read it in the papers . You see it . But I knew the people here who counted supported me . That gave me the feeling to go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was never any wavering in support of McWilliams : " The difference in this deal is everybody loves David McWilliams . Everybody wanted to see him make it . " <p> Texas ' rejuvenation might have been born in 6 a.m. workouts by the players in the winter and spring . And instead of using the new weight room , they temporarily repaired to the old , dingy chamber under the stadium . Return to the basics , return to the roots . <p> " We were just tired , " Gardere said , " of getting beat . " <p> Whatever it takes , was McWilliams ' motto for this team . He set an example by having a workout regimen that took off 25 pounds . <p> " I thought I was in the Army , " tackle Stan Thomas said . " Or they had reopened Alcatraz . They 'd just built this $ 12 million weight room , and we 're over here working out with the spiders , the crickets and the bats . But in the spring , I felt something was different about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Cashes have been perfect examples . Inseparable since they were kids , they now face the prospect of playing their last game together . <p> Keith , the flanker with 33 catches : " It was a given we 'd always go to the same college . Now this is the top of the peak . But we know we 're not going to be together the rest of our lives . " <p> Keith on Kerry : " He 's my favorite player . " <p> Kerry , the tight end with 22 catches , on Keith : " If I had to pay to see him play , I 'd pay . " <p> Keith : " I have the most catches . But he has the best . " <p> The Penn State victory was the best way to start , but the Longhorns say they began to truly believe after their only defeat . They led Colorado most of the way before losing 29-22 . <p> " We took one of the top teams in the nation and beat the crap out of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . We talked after the game that we never wanted to have that feeling again . " <p> So the victories began to mount . A 14-13 , last-minute win against Oklahoma was a big step . But the nation was not really stirred until the night the Longhorns took apart Houston 's run-and-shoot 45-24 . <p> McWilliams decided there would be no gimmicks . Just what Texas did best - a four-man line to rush , and man-to-man in the secondary . <p> The result impressed no one more than Miami coach Dennis Erickson , who lately has been an avid viewer of that film . <p> " They rushed the living dog out of ( David ) Klingler , " he said . " That may be as good a job as I 've seen done against the run-and-shoot . " <p> End Oscar Giles can still remember the sweet sensation in the second half when " Houston finally realized they were n't going to score a lot of points . They were in shock . " <p> Shock the nation . Gardere , who has 11 touchdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - outpassed his more famed counterpart 322-299 . <p> " I do n't think much about statistics , " he said . " Except wins . " <p> It 's a good year to do that in Texas . The Longhorns are back . Maybe the Southwest Conference , too . It has been a dark decade for that league , and this should be tonic . <p> " The league needed this badly , " Dodds said . " Now there are eight athletic directors out there who may not agree , but I can be as biased as hell . We 're a national school , if the conference has a national school . " <p> National . Unknown . Shocking . <p> TEXT OF GRAPHIC <p> ' Horns make run at No. 1 <p> The Texas Longhorns were not ranked in the preseason USA TODAY/CNN Top 25 .
