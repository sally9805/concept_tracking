<p> Rap rap . Who 's there ? Dozens of screaming , rhyming , youthful voices wanting to brag , party , preach , teach or just tell it like it is . <p> This prideful pot of street poetry is no longer edging its way into the mainstream . It is the mainstream . <p> Rap 's takeover has been swift and merciless , supplanting rock this year as the cutting-edge sound in pop . <p> " The rest of the country has begun to agree with what those of us in the industry have been saying all along , namely that rap is the popular rock ' n ' roll of the day , " says Bill Adler , author of Rap : Portraits and Lyrics of a Generation of Black Rockers . <p> Just look at the charts : The top-selling album of the year is M.C. Hammer 's Please Hammer , Do n't Hurt ' Em , with 8 million records , CDs and tapes sold . The " dancin ' machine " from Oakland , Calif. , kept even such stars as George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In fact , it took another rapper to unseat him : Vanilla Ice , whose Ice Ice Baby became the first rap single to nab the No. 1 pop slot . His album , To the Extreme , reached the Top 10 in just five weeks , faster than any other debut this year , says Billboard 's Paul Grein . It 's second now only to Hammer , with 6 million copies sold . <p> This year , Hammer and Ice toured together , giving thousands their first exposure to a rap concert . But their raps , blatantly commercial and heavily sampled ( " borrowing " snippets of old hits ) , are only a small part of a mushrooming rap world . Besides a small but growing army of rapping women ( Monie Love , Queen Latifah ) , the genre incorporates wildly diverse offshoots ranging from Christian rappers to rap-dance hybrids . " This is the year that rap exploded , " says Grein . <p> Indeed , the fallout is everywhere . Fresh Prince ( of duo D.J . Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful prime- time TV show , NBC 's Fresh Prince of Bel-Air . Duo Kid ' N Play starred in the first rap prime-time special in May , NBC 's Rock the House . They even have their own Saturday-morning cartoon show . <p> And rappers have invaded Hollywood : Soundtracks feature D-Nice rapping in Glory and Hammer in Rocky V. Upcoming rapper roles include L.L. Cool J. in The Hard Way ( starring Michael J. Fox ) , Ice-T in New Jack City and Vanilla Ice in Ninja Turtles II : The Secret of Ooze . <p> But the most popular rap medium is videos . " M.C. Hammer and Vanilla would n't have anywhere close to the success that they have had today without video , " says David Mays of Source , a rap magazine . " Rap is changing from the lyrical and musical to the visual . " <p> Hammer 's 51-minute video , Please Hammer , Do n't Hurt ' Em : The Movie , has sold 205,000 copies - 50,000 copies sold is considered a hit . One of MTV 's highest-rated shows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music . " If you ... pump it into over 50 million homes six days a week , you 're bound to have an impact , " says MTV 's Doug Herzog . <p> Yet radio still shies away from all but the most inoffensive rap . Urban stations " are always trying to get away from their blackness , " complains Chuck D , leader of the highly political Public Enemy . <p> " I love rap music , but I know if I play too much of it , I run the risk of losing my high ratings , " counters Tom Joyner , a DJ who commutes between stations WGCI-FM in Chicago and KKDA-FM in Dallas . <p> " Although there 's a large segment of the audience that loves it , an even larger segment of the audience ca n't stand it . " <p> That may be partly because hard-hitting forms of the music have opened controversy . The free-speech issue that encompasses all the arts was galvanized by 2 Live Crew 's obscenity trial in Florida in October . <p> Public Enemy preached explosively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is landing on many critics ' year's-best lists . And the violence and horrors of inner-city life were recounted in graphic and sometimes grisly detail by so-called gangsta rappers . <p> These chroniclers of ganglife and street reality have grown tremendously in popularity . Ice Cube ( AmeriKKKa 's Most Wanted ) , Luke Featuring the 2 Live Crew ( Banned in The U.S.A. ) and N.W.A. 's 100 Miles and Runnin ' , all made the Top 30 pop album list . <p> Rap has certainly come a long way since DJ Kool Herc , considered the father of rap , began " scratching " records ( deliberately drawing the needle across the vinyl to create rhythmic patterns ) " for fun . I never knew what I did would turn out like this . " <p> Like rock ' n ' roll in its infancy , rap faces problems . Darryl James , editor of Rappin ' magazine and of the syndicated radio show " Hip Hop Countdown and Report , " points to 2 Live Crew 's trial as a symptom of racism : " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N ' Roses and Andrew Dice Clay ? " <p> And most live rap shows - except for highly commercial , positive-message acts - are becoming an endangered species . The fear of violence has prompted worried insurers to charge some acts several million dollars , pricing rappers out of the concert halls , says G-Street Express concert promoter Darryll Brooks . <p> But James says , " You look at performances of other types of music , and there 's the same kind of violence . " <p> Despite its growing pains , rap continues to sprout in every direction . This year has seen the emergence of Christian rappers like P.I.D. ( Preachers in Disguise ) , Hispanic rappers ( Mellow Man Ace ) , British rappers ( Snap ) , and downright silly rappers ( Biz Markie ) . <p> Though women are still greatly outnumbered by men , they 're gaining in popularity with the eclectic Queen Latifah , the critically heralded Monie Love , and Bitches with Problems , who spew graphic diatribes with the zeal of N.W.A. <p> Still , Hammer and Vanilla Ice represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And some fear that just as over-exposure and bad records killed disco , overly commercial rap and record labels ' haste to sign anyone who rhymes could sound the form 's death knell . <p> " It 's scary to see somebody like Vanilla Ice come along and become successful when so many rappers , great vocalists as well as writers , have been out here for years , " says rap mogul Russell Simmons , whose Rush Management handles such top acts as Run-D.M.C . <p> But Simmons relents : " Ice is probably opening some new ears to rap music . And maybe , just maybe , some little girl may get turned on to rap and end up with an L.L. Cool J record . " CUTLINE : M.C. Hammer tops the charts with this year 's album CUTLINE : Vanilla Ice runs close second behind Hammer CUTLINE : Public Enemy will make many pop critics ' year-end lists CUTLINE : MONIE LOVE : Female rapper finds an audience
