I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation ; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight . There ... the sun is for ever visible ; its broad disk just skirting the horizon , and diffusing a perpetual splendor . There ... snow and frost are banished ; and , sailing over a calm sea , we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe ... What may not be expected in a country of eternal light ? Delaware River while the sun beat on his shoulders . A mild breeze , the smells of tar and copper . A few yards away the Narwhal loomed , but he was looking instead at the partial reflection trapped between hull and pilings .

If the dew is pure , the pearls are brilliant ; if cloudy , the pearls are dull . Far above him , but mirrored as well , long strands of cloud moved one way and gliding gulls another . fleet . Everyone headed somewhere , Erasmus thought . England , Africa , California ; stony islands alive with seals ; the coast of Florida . Yet no one , among all those travelers , who might offer him advice . He turned back to his work . Where was this mound of supplies to go ? An untidy package yielded , beneath its waterproof wrappings , a dozen plum puddings that brought him near to tears .

How had half the meat biscuit been stowed with the candles and the lamp oil ? And where were the last members of the crew ? In his pocket he had another list , the final roster : ZECHARIAH VOORHEES , Commander AMOS TYLER , Sailing Master COLIN TAGLIABEAU , First Officer GEORGE FRANCIS , Second Officer JAN BOERHAAVE , Surgeon ERASMUS D. WELLS , Naturalist and Mr. Francis , who together would have charge of the ship 's daily operations , were experienced whaling men .

Erasmus feared , for him to fail . He was forty years old and had a history of failure ; he 'd sailed , when hardly more than a boy , on a voyage so thwarted it became a national joke . Since then his life 's work had come to almost nothing . No wife , no children , no truly close friends ; a sister in a difficult situation . What he had now was this pile of goods , and a second chance . up to see Zeke hanging from the rigging like a flag . His long arms were stretched above a thatch of golden hair ; as he laughed his teeth were gleaming in his mouth ; he was twenty-six and made Erasmus feel like a fossil . Everything about this moment was tied to Zeke . The hermaphrodite brig about to become their home had once been part of Zeke 's family 's packet line ; with his father 's money , Zeke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the ice , iron plates wrapped around her bows , tarred felt layered between the double-planked decks . In charge of the expedition -- and hence , Erasmus reminded himself , of him -- Zeke had chosen Erasmus to gather the equipment and stores surrounding him now in such bewildering heaps . malt , knives and needles for barter with the Esquimaux , guns and ammunition , coal and wood , tents and cooking lamps and woolen clothing , buffalo skins , a library , enough wooden boards to house over the deck in an emergency . And what about the spirit thermometers , or the four chronometers , the microscope , and all the stores for his specimens : spirits of wine , loose gauze , prenumbered labels and glass jars , arsenical soap for preserving bird skins , camphor and pillboxes for preserving insects , dissecting scissors , watch glasses , pins , string , glass tubes and sealing wax , bungs and soaked bladders , brain hooks and blowpipes and egg drills , a sweeping net ... too many-things. from the Utah mountains . Just then he would have given anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it meant to leave a life . But Copernicus was gone , still , again , and the wolf skins were handsome , but where would they fit ? The sledges , specially constructed after Zeke 's own design , had arrived two weeks late and would n't fit into the space Erasmus had planned for them ; and he could n't arrange the scientific equipment in any reasonable way . Every inch of the cabin was full , and they were not yet in it . one hand for a second , and then dropped lightly to the deck . Soon he joined Erasmus among the wharf 's clutter , moving the theodolite and uncovering a crate of onions . " These look nice , " he said . " Do we have enough ? " walked up with the news that their cook had deserted . He 'd last been seen two days earlier , Mr. Tagliabeau reported .

Mr. Tagliabeau , if you 'd be so kind as to take a small recruiting tour among the taverns ... " drunken sot . " dressed in Lincoln-green frock coats , white pantaloons , and straw hats trailing black ostrich feathers come dancing up the wharf . The United Toxophilites , Erasmus saw , making a surprise farewell to Zeke . The sight made him groan . Once he 'd been part of this group of archers ; once this had all seemed charming . Resurrecting the old sport of archery , flourishing the arrows retrieved from those first , magical trips to the Plains -- as a boy , he 'd participated in a meet that drew two thousand guests . But he 'd lost his taste for such diversions after the Exploring Expedition , and he 'd let his association with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new young crowd that had taken over the club . other ships stared . " Voorhees ! Voorhees ! " length of the wharf , and formed a circle around him . Erasmus received courteous nods but no recognition . He listened to the mocking , high-spirited speeches , which likened Zeke to a great Indian chief setting off on a buffalo hunt . One youngster with a shock of red hair presented Zeke with a chalice ; an elflike boy offered a patent-leather belt from which dangled a grease box and a tassel . Zeke accepted his gifts with a smile and a handshake , thanking each man by name and showing the poise that had made Erasmus 's sister call him a natural leader . he eyed the grease box . A few years of sailing from Philadelphia to Dublin and Hull on the ships of his father 's packet line , investigating currents and ocean creatures , although often , as he 'd admitted to Erasmus , he 'd been too seasick to work . Other than that all his learning came from books . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through their fathers ' friendship and an interest in natural history . Now they were further bound by Lavinia . But that Erasmus should be standing in Zeke 's shadow , setting off for the arctic under the command of this untried youth -- again he was amazed by his decision . through the circle of green-coated men , seized Erasmus 's arm , and drew him into the center . " I could n't do this without Erasmus Darwin Wells , " he cried . " Three cheers for our chief naturalist , my right hand ! " mixed with disdain ; as if Zeke wanted to emulate him , but without his flaws . But exactly this grudging caution had stranded him alone in midlife , and he pushed the thought aside . When the Toxies presented their green-and-gold pennant , he grasped the end marked with a merry archer and smiled at Zeke . Zeke made a speech of thanks ; Erasmus made a shorter one , not mentioning that he 'd known the club 's founders or that he 'd learned to shoot a bow when some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Captain Tyler hanging over the Narwhal 's rail , gazing curiously at them . His face , Erasmus thought , was the size and color of a ham . Erasmus was once more alone . He folded the pennant and tucked it into the wolf skins . Then he reconsidered the stowing of the sledges : back to front in a line down the center of the hold ? or piled in a tight tower near the bow ? He worked quietly for an hour , pushing down his worries by the repeated checking of items against his lists . Mr. Tagliabeau interrupted him , returning to the wharf in the company of a fresh-faced , dark-haired , blue-eyed boy . Zeke hopped down to investigate . After making introductions all around , Mr. Tagliabeau added , " Ned would like to join our expedition . " Ned over . " You 've had experience cooking ? " the rough area by the wharves , Erasmus noted his heavy Irish accent . have enjoyed them . But I believe I would have , if I 'd had work and meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck very much .

Loggers are hungry men . " he can surely feed us. " seamen . They can be a bit rough . " and say your good-byes , we leave in three days . " Off he went , bounding down the wharf like an antelope . shoes , came to join the expedition . Later Erasmus would think many times how little might have steered Ned away . Mr. Tagliabeau might not have bumped into him beneath the chandler 's awning ; the Toxies ' ostrich-feathered hats might have spooked him had he arrived but a few minutes earlier ; Zeke might not have been there to interview him had he arrive but a little later . Any small coincidence might have done . THAT NIGHT ERASMUS was sleepless again . In the Repository , his family 's little natural history museum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he 'd been doing . For twelve years he 'd been camped out here , his world contracted to display cabinets stuffed with dead animals , boxes of seeds and trays of fossils , the occasional stray beam of light shining through the windows like a message from another planet . Framed engravings of eminent naturalists leaned down from the bookshelves , watching benignly as he bent to work that was n't work , and went nowhere . Who could understand that life ? Or how he 'd decided , finally , to leave it ? more than a decade . Everything showed his father 's hand , from the carved ferns on the moldings to his own name . He was Erasmus Darwin for the British naturalist , grandfather to the young man who 'd set off on the Beagle ; his brothers were named after Copernicus , Linnaeus , and Alexander von Humboldt . Four boys gaping up at their father like nestlings waiting for worms . An engraver and printer by trade , Frank Wells 's passion had been natural history and his truest friends the Peales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Audubon of the beautiful birds and poor peculiar Rafinesque , who 'd died in a garret downtown . Pliny 's Natural History to his sons . Pliny the Elder had died of his scientific curiosity , he 'd said ; the fumes of Vesuvius had choked him when he 'd lingered to watch the smoke and lava . But before that he 'd compiled a remarkable collection of what he 'd believed to be facts . Some true , some false -- but even the false still useful for the beauty with which they were expressed , and for what they said about the ways men conceived of each other , and of the world . Sometimes pacing , sometimes sitting on a tuft of grass , Erasmus 's father had passed down Pliny 's descriptions of extraordinary peoples living beyond the edge of the known . A race of nomads with legs like snakes ; a race of forest dwellers running swiftly on feet pointed backward ; a single-legged race who move by hopping and then rest by lying on their backs and raising their singular feet above their heads , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of thinking about the great variety and mutability of human nature . How easily , he 'd said , might we not exist at all . How easily might we be transformed into something wholly different . the imagination and the perils of not observing the world directly . Yet although he was a great collector of explorers ' tales he 'd traveled very little himself ; Erasmus had never known what his father would most like to have seen . As a counterpoint to Pliny he 'd offered his sons the living , breathing science of his friends . They 'd helped design the Repository and delighted Erasmus and his brothers with accounts of their travels . When Lavinia was born , they 'd named her after her dying mother and tried to distract their friend from his grief with bones and feathers . floor . He stopped at a wooden case holding trays of fossil teeth . Beneath the third tray was a false bottom , which only he knew about ; in the secret space below the molars was a woman 's black calf walking boot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before the servants took her clothes away , to be given piece by piece to the poor , he 'd stolen the boots she 'd worn most often . For years he 'd hidden them in his room , sometimes running his hands up the buttons as another boy might have fingered a rosary . Later , about to leave on his ill-fated first trip , he 'd given Lavinia the left boot after swearing her to secrecy . This other he 'd buried . Had it always been so small ? The sole was hardly longer than his hand , the leather was cracking , the buttons loose . Where Lavinia 's was he had no idea . the Repository , a small income , and the care of Lavinia until she married . Which meant , he thought , that he 'd inherited all the responsibility and none of the freedom or even the solid work . Was it his fault he had n't known what to do ? The family firm had gone to his middle brothers , who 'd settled side by side downtown , within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a planet that did n't interest him . Meanwhile Copernicus had headed west as soon as he received his share of the estate . Out there , among the Indians , he painted buffalo hunts and vast landscapes while Erasmus and Lavinia , left behind , leaned against each other in his absence . been shown at the Academy of Fine Arts . And sometimes -- when he remembered , when he could be bothered -- he sent packets of seeds , shaken from random plants that had caught his eye . His afterthoughts , which had become Erasmus 's chief occupation . Erasmus had examined , classified , labeled , cataloged , added them to his lists . He filed them in tall wooden towers of tiny drawers , alongside the seeds his father 's friends had brought back from China and the Yucatan and the Malay Archipelago , and those he 'd salvaged -- stolen , really -- from the collections of the Exploring Expedition . When his eyes grew strained and his skin felt moldy , he retreated out back , between the house and the river and behind the Repository , planting samples in oblong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . In Africa , his father had said , are a tribe of people who have no heads , but have mouths and eyes attached to their chests . Sleep eluded him yet again and his lists bobbed behind his lids . In Germantown and along the Wissahickon , people sent him socks and marmalade and then dreamed of this expedition . Vicarious travelers , sleeping while he could not and conjuring up a generic exotic land . Lavinia had friends like this , for whom Darwin 's Tierra del Fuego and Cook 's Tahiti had merged with Parry 's Igloolik and d'Urville 's Antarctica until a place arose in which ice cliffs coexisted with acres of pampas , through which Tongan savages chased ostriches chasing camels . Those people sent six candles encased in brown paper but could n't keep north and south straight in their minds , placing penguins and Esquimaux in the same confused ice and pleating a continent into a frozen sea . the planning and buying and stowing but the months sitting idly on the decks of a ship , the long stretches when nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolved and one became a stranger to one 's life . No one knew how frightened he was , or the mental lists he made of all he dreaded . Ridiculous things , ignoble things . His bunk would be too short or too narrow or damp or drafty ; his comrades would snore or twitch or moan ; he 'd be overcome by longing for women ; he 'd never sleep . Sleepless , he would grow short-tempered ; short-tempered , he 'd say something wrong to Zeke and make an enemy . The coarse food would upset his stomach and dyspepsia would upset his brain ; what if he forgot how to think ? His hands would be cold , they were always cold ; he 'd slice a specimen or stab himself . His joints would ache , his back would hurt , they 'd run out of coffee , on which he relied ; a storm would snap the masts in half , a whale would ram the ship . They 'd get lost , they 'd find nothing , they 'd fail . On his earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion , but tonight it let him down . Pen , inkpot , words on white paper ; an inkstain on his thumb . He could n't convey clearly the scene at the wharf . He gazed at his first messy attempt and then added : Why is it so difficult simply to capture what was there ? That old problem of trying to show things both sequentially , and simultaneously . If I drew that scene I 'd show everything happening all at once , everyone present and every place visible , from the bottom of the river to the clouds . But when I describe it in words one thing follows another and everything 's shaped by my single pair of eyes , my single voice . I wish I could show it as if through a fan of eyes . Widening out from my single perspective to several viewpoints , then many , so the whole picture might appear and not just my version of it . As if I were n't there . The river as the fish saw it , the ship as it looked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kynd , the Toxies as they appeared to Captain Tyler : all those things , at once . So someone else might experience those hours for himself . these pages meant only for his own eyes , he was n't honest . He 'd left out the first mate 's self-important strut ; the appalling sight of his own hands , which amid the onions had suddenly looked just like his father 's ; and the sense that they were all posturing in front of each other , perhaps for the benefit of the green-coated boys . He rubbed at the stain on his thumb . Nor was it true , or not wholly true , that he wanted to paint the scene as if he were n't in it . He did want his own point of view to count , even as he also wanted to be invisible . Such a liar , he thought . Although chiefly he lied to himself . He 'd wrapped himself in a cloud . Beyond it the world pulsed and streamed but he was cut off ; people loved and sorrowed without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WERE N'T ready to leave . Captain Tyler banished Zeke and Erasmus the next afternoon , while the men tore out and then rebuilt the bulkheads in the hold . The sledges had n't fit after all , in any configuration ; the wood took more space than planned and the measurements on Zeke 's sketch had turned out to be wrong . A clock ticked in Erasmus 's chest : two days , two days , two days . They could leave no later , they were already late , the season for arctic navigation was short and the newspaper reporters and expedition 's donors were ready to send them off on Thursday . Did he have enough socks ? The right charts , enough pencils ? and Lavinia and her friend Alexandra Copeland . They were in the front parlor , all four of them working . Maps and charts and drawings spread everywhere . Without explanation he rose and ran to the Repository , which he ransacked in search of Scoresby 's work on the polar ice . he could n't remember packing it . And could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so crucial . The wry face Alexandra had made as he bolted embarrassed him . Yet her presence had been his idea -- Lavinia could n't stay alone , with only the servants for company , and she had n't wanted to join Linnaeus or Humboldt . " A companion , " he 'd proposed . " Who 'd like to share our home , in return for room and board and a modest payment . " rooms on the second floor . When Linnaeus and Humboldt , unexpectedly generous , offered work hand-coloring the engravings they were printing for an entomology book , Alexandra had accepted that as well and made herself at home . Now there was no escaping her ; sometimes she even followed him into the Repository . But she was good for Lavinia , he reminded himself . The way she pulled Lavinia into her work was wonderful . He took a breath and headed back . frowning with concentration and shifting her gaze from the original painting pinned above her desk to the engraved copy she was coloring with Alexandra 's help . Caught up , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his seeds . The plates showed four tropical beetles . The sun lit the brushes , the water jars , and the ruffled pinafores so dabbed with gold and rust and blue that the beetles seemed to have leapt from the plates to the women 's legs . " Has anyone seen my copy of Scoresby ? " he asked . her brush to the paper , leaving three tiny golden dots . " I did n't know you needed it . " room for one more thing . " away , Lavinia called for tea and leaned over the table on which Erasmus and Zeke had spread their papers : rather too close to Zeke 's shoulder , Erasmus thought . As if she were pulled by the fragrance of Zeke 's skin ; as if she did not have the sense to resist the almost farcical beauty that made women stare at Zeke on the street and men hum with envy . It pained him to watch her betrayed by her body 's yearnings . To him she was lovely , with her wide hazel eyes and rounded chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to the gaze of others -- perhaps even Zeke -- she was merely pleasant-looking . She seemed to know that herself , as she knew that among her monthly meetings of earnest young women , gathered to discuss Goethe and Swedenborg and Fourier , she was valued more for her sensibility than for her brilliance . One by one those women had married and disappeared from the meetings , leaving behind only Alexandra and her . Once , when he 'd been voicing his concerns about Zeke , she 'd said , " I know I love him more than he loves me . It does n't bother me . " Then had flushed so darkly he 'd wanted to pick her up and pace her around the floor , as he 'd done when she was an infant and needed comforting . past Devon and Cornwallis and Beechey Island , where Franklin 's winter camp had been found , then south along Boothia Peninsula and King William Land , Erasmus thought how maps showed only two things , land and water . To someone who had n't traveled , their journey over that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turn right , go north or south , steer by this headland or that bay . He and Zeke , who 'd pored over their predecessors ' accounts , knew otherwise . Ice , both fluid and solid , appeared and disappeared with consistent inconsistency ; one year an inlet might be open , the next walled shut . Lavinia , unaware of this , traced the route backward and said with satisfaction , " It 's not so very far . You 'll be home before October . " expeditions have to winter over . We 've provisioned for a full eighteen months , in case we 're frozen in. " with Erasmus 's book and then asked the question Lavinia might have been framing in her mind . " I have n't understood this all spring , " she said . " If you take this route , which you say concentrates most efficiently on the areas in which you have some evidence of Franklin 's presence , how can you also search for signs of an open polar sea ? De Haven and Penny reported Jones Sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothed her paint-stained garment . " Ross found most of Barrow Strait frozen , and Peel Sound as well . Even if you manage to approach the region of Rae 's discoveries , which lies south of all those areas , surely you ca n't also simultaneously head north ? " worried him for months , but he 'd pushed it aside ; Zeke had n't mentioned his desire to find an open polar sea since the evening that had launched them all on this path . Lavinia 's twenty-sixth birthday party , back in November ; Alexandra had been present that night as well , although Erasmus had hardly noticed her . He 'd been full of hope that Lavinia was about to get what she most desired . with greenery and lining the sills with candles , scrubbing the dissecting table and shrouding it with crisp linen , on which he 'd spread biscuits , a roasted ham , a turkey and a salmon in aspic . Lavinia had rejected her first three suitors -- too dull , she 'd said . Too weak , not smart enough . While her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for Zeke and somehow won him . Erasmus had been terrified for her during her long campaign , then relieved , then worried again : his own fault . Zeke had asked for her hand but been vague about the details , and Erasmus had failed to press him . His father would have known better , he thought . His father would n't have permitted Lavinia to bind herself for an uncertain length of time . The damage was done , but secretly Erasmus had hoped Zeke might choose the party to announce a wedding date . herself , radiant in white silk trimmed with blue ribbons . She stood perfectly still when Zeke , just as Erasmus had hoped , silenced the room and said , " I have an announcement ! " looked confused . Zeke rested his elbow on a case that held a bird-of-paradise . " You 've all heard the news announced by John Rae earlier this month , " he said . He stood with his chin up , his chest out , one hand dancing in the air . " No doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the fate of Franklin 's expedition , and my relief that some news -- however fragmentary , and possibly incorrect -- has been obtained . " men , the many rescue attempts , the details of what Rae had discovered -- old news to Erasmus , who 'd followed every newspaper article . His guests listened , glasses in hands , among them women who would have listened with equal interest had Zeke been reciting the agricultural products of China ; anything , Erasmus imagined them thinking , for this chance to gaze at Zeke blamelessly . Yet his own sister was the woman Zeke had chosen . " Perhaps you also feel , as I do , " Zeke added , " that now that the area has been defined , someone has to search further for any possible survivors . " of Lavinia 's face . She looked as puzzled as he felt . backing of a number of our leading merchants for another expedition . Our valiant Dr. Kane has been searching for Franklin in the wrong area , and although we 're all worried about him -- and although I 'd be the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't already being organized -- something more is needed . I propose to set forth this spring , to search more thoroughly for Franklin in the areas below Lancaster Sound . While I 'm there , I also propose to study the region , and to further investigate the possibility of an open polar sea . " something like a smile , hoping no one would notice his surprise . What merchants , when , how ... did everyone know about this but him ? Lavinia , even , who might have hidden her knowledge -- but she wore a smile as forced as his own . Zeke must have made these arrangements in secret , taking pleasure in presenting his plan only when it was complete . about where Zeke might go , and how he might get there , and what sort of ship and crew he envisioned , Zeke took Lavinia 's hands . She beamed as if his announcement were the ideal birthday present , and when a guest sat down at the piano and began to play , she and Zeke led the crowd to the floor . his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still night air when Zeke appeared with two glasses and a bottle . He had to ask questions , Erasmus thought . Fatherly questions , although that role still felt odd : what this meant in terms of the engagement , whether Zeke wanted to marry Lavinia before he left -- or release her , perhaps , until he returned . the glasses and lit a cigar for himself . Erasmus opened his mouth to speak , and Zeke said , " Erasmus -- you must come with me . When are you going to get another chance like this ? " expeditions he 'd already missed -- was this what he 'd been waiting for ? Even Elisha Kent Kane had spurned him , sailing off with a crew of Philadelphians younger but no smarter than himself . Perhaps Zeke sensed his discouragement , and the extent of his wounded vanity . else as knowledgeable about the natural history of the polar regions ? Or as familiar with the hardships of such a journey ?

Erasmus said , " You 're kind to think of me . But you might have asked me earlier -- I have responsibilities here , and of course my own work ... " he said , pacing before the columns . " It 's a huge imposition -- I would n't think of asking you if your work were n't so invaluable ... but that 's why you 're the right person . I did n't want to bother you until I was sure I had backing for the expedition . Think of what we 'll see ! " still be trapped in the Erebus and the Terror . Even if they could n't be found , many new species , even new lands , were there to be discovered . Erasmus thought of being free , this time , to investigate everything without the noxious Navy discipline . He thought of northern sights to parallel , even exceed , his brief experience in the Antarctic ; of discoveries in natural history that might prove extraordinarily important . Then he thought of his sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foaming like a spray of catalpa blossom . to talk with you .

So Linnaeus and Humboldt can run the business without you . So you have n't found anyone to fall in love with since Sarah Louise . " made him feel like he 'd swallowed a stone . A dull ache , which never quite left him . As Lavinia knew . do n't see Copernicus moping around , you do n't see Copernicus wasting his life ... I need you . " and his brothers used to bolt for the woods and return hours later , to find Lavinia waiting by a window with an unread book in her lap . He 'd been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoes and taught her to read . Sometimes , when the other boys were n't around and he 'd remembered not just that her birth had cost him his mother , but that she 'd never had a mother , they 'd drawn very close .

" Do you understand ? Do you remember what that feels like ? What if something happens to him ? You have to take care of him for me. " very hot . Once , after Zeke had been describing the shipwreck that made him a local hero , Erasmus had found her weeping in the garden . Not with delayed fear over what might have happened to Zeke , not with hysteria -- but with longing , she 'd managed to make him understand . A boundless desire for Zeke . When he 'd tried to remind her that Zeke had flaws as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , I know . But it does n't matter .

" You 're sure ... " he said . " You feel sure of his feelings for you ? " know he does . " the party . And through a process he still did n't understand , he 'd been led to this table and Alexandra 's pointed questions ; to the fact that , in two days , he 'd be sailing north in the company of a young man he 'd known for ages yet could n't imagine accepting orders from .

Now he avoided the eyes of the girl with the tray and drew a breath , waiting to hear what Zeke would say about the open polar sea . that she 'd remembered his comment at the party , it did n't show . " I 've noticed that . So you must have learned about the stretches of open water persisting all winter and recurring in the same places every year . What the Russians call polynyas . Inglefield found open water in Smith Sound . Birds have been seen migrating northward from Canada . A warm current flows northward beneath the surface , several people have observed it -- suppose it leads to a temperate ocean , free from ice , surrounding the North Pole beyond a frozen barrier ?

A portrait of Franklin in full-dress uniform hung in the Narwhal 's cabin -- Franklin , Franklin , Zeke had said , as he asked the men for money . It made sense that he concentrated on this aspect of the voyage -- how proud the merchants were , contributing to such a good cause ! In Zeke , Erasmus thought , they saw a young man who could succeed at anything . The man they 'd dreamed of being , the man they hoped their sons might be . Other expeditions might have failed , but Zeke 's would not . In the arctic one can never predict where the ice will allow one to go , nor one 's speed , nor even always one 's direction . My plan is to follow this route and search for Franklin . But were conditions to be unexpectedly good -- were one of the northern channels to be open , say -- it 's possible we 'd do some exploring . " months ? " the springy golden tufts ; perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Erasmus thought , a bit annoyed that Alexandra did n't . A sensible woman , she seemed immune to Zeke 's charms . here on the maps where you 'd head north at all . " raise this money to search for Franklin , and then purposefully head in another direction , that would be quite wrong . " " The maps never tell us what we need , " he said , turning toward Lavinia . " That 's part of the reason we go . " gestures and the women 's responses he had n't been paying sufficient attention . The lamps were lit , the sun was setting , they were munching delicious chocolate cake ; the maps beckoned and he was dreaming of glory . His own glory , his own desires . They might find survivors of Franklin 's expedition ; or if not , surely better evidence of what had happened than Rae 's dispiriting tale . With any luck they 'd find other things as well . All sorts of specimens , not just plants but seaweeds , fishes , birds -- he would write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their descriptions ; his talent was for drawing from nature , capturing the salient features as only a trained observer could . Copernicus , so skilled with color and light , would turn the sketches into paintings ; Linnaeus and Humboldt would prepare the plates . Together they 'd make something beautiful . For years , in the light of his disappointments , he 'd pretended to himself that he was n't ambitious -- but he was , he was . And lucky beyond belief to be part of this voyage . A blaze of excitement blinded him . all this ? " and take what opportunities are offered . " bring it , after all . Surely there was room for one small book . " Zeke and I will respond to what we find , and decide accordingly . " THAT NIGHT , IN her diary , Alexandra wrote : It 's not Lavinia 's fault her brothers underestimate her . I know she 'll be different once the men leave and we 're on our own ; her mind dissolves in Zeke 's presence . I 'll be glad when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so spacious -- what would my parents think , I wonder , if they were alive to see me in these two gorgeous rooms I now call my own ? The window over my bed looks down on a planting of dwarf trees . My bed-linen is changed weekly , by someone other than me . And this painting is such a pleasure , so much more satisfying than needlework . So much better paid . Beneath the lining of my sewing box I 've already tucked a surprising sum . Soon I 'll be able to purchase some books of my own , an extravagance when I have the Repository shelves to browse through , once the men leave ... I 'm impatient for them to go , I am . And wish that , like Erasmus , I might have the luxury of sleeping out there . Zeke speaks ? I wonder what Erasmus was like as a boy . Before he grew so frozen , before he sat with his chin tucked into his collar like that , and his right hand wringing his left so strongly one wonders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was a girl he was fond of beetles and moths , and teased the succession of governesses who raised her . I ca n't imagine him teasing anyone . THE NARWHAL SET sail on May 28 , in such a wild flurry that everything important seemed still undone and nothing Erasmus meant to say got said . He and Zeke stood on the deck in their new gray uniforms , waving their handkerchiefs . Above them the Toxophilites ' pennant streamed in the wind , snapping straight out then beginning to droop , snapping straight out again . Terns hung motionless in the high currents , and Erasmus felt as though he himself were hanging between two worlds . knots close to shore , followed by the cheering Toxies in their green outfits . Dotting the wharf in separate clusters were Zeke 's and Erasmus 's relatives and friends , their clothing splayed into wide colored planes by the wind whipping across the river . Alexandra had brought her entire family -- her sisters , Emily and Jane ; her brother , Browning ; and Browning 's wife and infant son -- all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even here , in the open air , they could n't expand beyond the confines of the tiny house they 'd shared since their parents ' deaths . They were small , neat , and yet somehow fierce-looking ; abolitionists , serious young people . They dressed in the colors of sparrows and doves but more closely resembled , Erasmus thought , a family of saw-whet owls . Browning had a Bible in his hands . she and Browning had over the verses he read out loud . Later she 'd sketch a portrait of Erasmus during these last minutes , which showed his hand clasped nervously around a stay , his graying hair curled beneath a cap that made him look oddly boyish , the tip of his long , thin nose sniffing at the wind . But for now she only stood silently , watching him watch everyone . In the oily water around the pilings wood shavings swirled and tossed . from the engraving firm and some representatives from the Voorhees packet line ; beyond them were Linnaeus and Humboldt , as plump and glossy as beavers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in swirls of blue and green and flashing in the sun like a trout . At the tip of the wharf , befitting their support of the expedition , came Zeke 's family . His father stood suave and proud , his still-thick thatch of ruddy hair moving in the wind and revealing his massive eyebrows and the lynxlike tufts on his ears . His mother , shrouded in black for the death of an aunt , was weeping . Not surprising , Erasmus thought ; she was famous for the way she coddled her only son . Flanking her were Zeke 's sisters , Violet and Laurel , beautifully dressed and seemingly contemptuous of their merchant husbands , who were n't sailing north . ship ; the tune piped by the Toxies ' piccolo player shattered in the breeze until the separate and unrelated notes merged with the calls of the gulls . Behind the mountains and beyond the north wind , Erasmus 's father had once read to him , past the cave where the cold arises , live a race of people called Hyperboreans . Here are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circuits of the stars . Here there is no disharmony and sorrow is unknown . The figures on the wharf began to shrink . Everyone , except the dead , whom Erasmus had ever loved ; every person who might be proud of him or admire his courage or worry over his fate . The faces faded , and then disappeared .
