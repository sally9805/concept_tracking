A Long Goodbye . Last Friday 71-year-old Hofstra coach Butch van Breda Kolff , retiring after a career that spanned 41 seasons and some 1,400 games at the high school , college and pro levels , took a 6-20 team into Buffalo for an East Coast Conference tournament first-round game that many thought would be his last appearance on the sideline . But the Flying Dutchmen knocked off Chicago State 86-77 that night and Troy State 90-89 in OT the next . On Sunday they prolonged their farewell to van Breda Kolff as long as possible by beating Northeastern Illinois 88-86 in double overtime for the ECC title  --  which does n't carry an NCAA tournament bid . It was sad but somehow fitting that this man , who was willing to coach anybody , anywhere , would end his career in front of a crowd that numbered little more than 100 . Van Breda Kolff never much cared who was playing or who was watching . He asked only that the game be played " the right way , " a demand that sometimes cost him his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departure from Hofstra  --  he decided to retire in part because of arrhythmia , which caused him to miss four games . His love of the basics made his last wins particularly sweet .
