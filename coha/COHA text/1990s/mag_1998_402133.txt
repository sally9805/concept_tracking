What a Scream ! // The same gooey-eyed gaze that Courteney Cox would plant on Tom Selleck , her former TV boyfriend on Friends-that was just the expression on her face one day last August . But Cox was n't acting when she visited the set of 20th Century Fox 's romantic comedy Never Been Kissed to watch her real-life beau , David Arquette , film a scene . " She had a big girlfriend smile on her face and was pointing out David for her mom and sister , " says Michelle Stephan , an extra on the film . " You could tell she was closely watching everything he was doing and smiling the whole time . " Get used to that grin .

" Cox recently told Craven that a chair Arquette moved into her sleekly decorated fourbedroom house in Brentwood , Calif. , was in the shape of a giant hand : " And Courteney said , " I do n't care . Before , if anybody had brought anything into my house that did n't match , I 'd have gone crazy . But now it just all seems kind of fun . " ' Craven capitalized on the Cox-Arquette mismatch by having their Scream characters-she played ruthless TV reporter Gale Weathers to his bumbling deputy Dewey Riley-kiss at the end of the sequel , a scene that made audiences cheer .

" Expect more of the same at the couple 's wedding ( they 've yet to divulge a date ) . " David is very creative with things like that , " says Patricia Childress , an actress who appeared with him in the 1996 TV miniseries Dead Man 's Walk . " He does everything with flair .

But rebounding from the breakup of her 5 1/2-year relationship with actor Michael Keaton , Cox seemed wary of the dating game . " Relationships are tougher than I thought , " she said to USA Today in 1997 , " and I 've got a lot of work to do on myself . " But , she added hopefully , " actors dating actors can work out .
