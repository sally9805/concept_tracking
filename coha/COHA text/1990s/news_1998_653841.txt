<p> On Monday , Jan. 4 , Europe 's new single currency , the euro , will be introduced in 11 nations with some 290 million people . But this old steel town , with a population of 250,000 and a tendency to attract unwelcome mockery of its provincialism , has beaten the rest of Europe to the punch . <p> While Britain itself has rejected initial participation in the single currency , the business leaders of Rotherham ( pronounced ROTH-er-um ) decided that for a week in mid-November , they would introduce the " Rotherham euro "  --  a voucher with a nominal value of 70 pence ( $1.12 ) , roughly what one euro was worth at the time . Two months before the euro 's debut in cross-border transactions and more than two years before real euro bills and coins will be available , some 90,000 euro vouchers were given out to the people of depressed South Yorkshire to let them know just what the euro-fuss is all about . In American terms , its equal would have been , say , a mock-dollar redeemable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a matter of " some hype , " acknowledged Phil Davies , a marketing consultant involved in the project . But he added that it " was hype , with substance , " because it drew attention to a debate that is growing more ferocious in Britain even as it watches the inception of the euro from the sidelines . <p> It is a debate in which economic issues have long been colored by a fierce nationalism , driven by conservative newspapers and politicians . Yet , it is also coming to reflect a more basic philosophic conflict between the freewheeling , market-driven ethos that Britain models on America and the big Government priorities of a Continent pressed to the left by the recent elections in France and Germany . <p> Many business leaders argue that Britain can not afford to delay joining the euro , saying that it will revolutionize European markets and that British exports will lose competitiveness if the country remains outside the euro zone . But others worry that monetary union would also mean higher taxes and heftier labor costs in line with the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency for long without a unified fiscal policy , " argued Kevin Gardiner , an economist with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in London . " So the question has to be raised : Do the British people want to cede fiscal sovereignty ? " <p> The latest flare-up in the debate concerns " harmonization , " the notion promoted by France and Germany that the euro will be undermined if some countries within the monetary union offer tax and labor incentives , drawing investment and money away from others , in much the same way as states in the United States compete for businesses . <p> But such talk is alarming in Britain , which cherishes its status as a magnet for banks and other companies that find the Continent too pricey . Compared with the 11 nations  --  Austria , Belgium , Finland , France , Germany , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Portugal and Spain  --  that will make up Euroland , Britain generally has weaker labor unions and lower taxes . Germany , for example , has a maximum tax rate of more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> France and Germany deny they are seeking uniform tax rates across Europe , saying what they want is a withholding tax on cross-border savings and an end to tax havens in places like Luxembourg . <p> While the British Government says it , too , is against unfair tax systems , it also does not want to alarm London 's financial district , the prime marketplace for Europe  --  euro or no euro . <p> " What we want , " said Gordon Brown , Britain 's Chancellor of the Exchequer , " is tax competition , not tax cooperation . " <p> The battle over taxation levels is one of several economic issues intertwined with the fiercely nationalistic political debate that has forced the Labor Government , like its Conservative predecessor , to adopt a wait-and-see policy . It says a decision on joining the euro will not be taken until after a referendum to be held after the next national election , which must be called , at the latest , by 2002 . <p> But , the single currency 's promoters maintain , the longer Britain stays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more conditions in Europe will be dictated by others . <p> In a way , Britain has already had a taste of that : when the central banks of the euro nations lowered interest rates on Dec. 3 , the Bank of England was a spectator . On Thursday , Britain 's central bank lowered its benchmark rate a half-point , to 6.25 percent  --  but still double the Euroland norm . <p> For critics of the euro , being outside Euroland is a plus , not a minus . Britain , they say , is at a different point in the economic cycle and has nothing to gain by exposing its strengths  --  cheaper labor , lower taxation and flexibility  --  to any further dictates of common European policies . <p> At its most visceral level , the political debate is driven by such euro-skeptic institutions as Rupert Murdoch 's mass-market newspaper , The Sun . A front-page of The Sun , for instance , described Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine of Germany as the most dangerous man in Europe , and hinted at a vulgar expletive to tell him what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nationalistic vein that there has already been a debate about whether Queen Elizabeth 's head would appear on the euro  --  as it does on the pound  --  even though Britain is not a member . ( Under current plans , an image of her head would be allowed . ) <p> For many euro advocates , though , Britain has already waited too long . <p> " Too many people in Britain have spent the last few years deluding themselves , some hoping that if we all shut our eyes tightly enough the single currency would simply go away , " said Niall Fitzgerald , the chairman of Unilever , the British-Dutch consumer products company . " Others arrogantly assumed that if Britain did n't like the idea it just would n't happen . " <p> On Nov. 23 , 114 business leaders took out a full-page advertisement in The Financial Times to urge a speedy embrace of the new currency . An earlier survey cited 63 percent of business respondents as saying they favored the euro . <p> Why ? Ask Julie A. Kenny , managing director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park on the outskirts of Rotherham . Mrs. Kenny started the business in 1986 with a start-up stake equivalent to $32,000 from the sale of a house with a further $13,000 in outside capital . These days , its annual sales , she said , are around $18 million , and her company , Pyronix Ltd. , is seen as a local success story . <p> Since 1992 , when the European Union introduced its single market , knocking down nearly all the remaining barriers to trade , finance and travel within Europe , Pyronix has exported some 40 percent of its output , the bulk of it to the Continent . But in recent years , as the pound has strengthened against the German mark and French franc , Pyronix 's Continental customers have complained about rising prices , while her British market has been undercut by cheaper imports . <p> " The exchange rate has meant tremendous pressure , " she said . The cost of a strong pound " has got to be found in reduced profits . " <p> Like other small British exporters , her company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with clients that want to pay in euros  --  only Siemens , the German electronics giant , has so far said it will  --  and it will put out a euro price list in January , when the currency comes into use in electronic transactions . Rotherham 's biggest employer , British Steel , is also prepared to use the euro . " We are going to allow our customers to decide which way they want to do business , " said Colin Jackson , a British Steel manager . <p> Mrs. Kenny now believes , with some qualifications , that Britain should join . " If it 's successful and the Europeans are trading extensively in euros , then we as businesses have to be on the inside , playing on the same terms as everyone else , rather than on the outside looking in , " she said . <p> The 114 signatories of business leaders ' advertisement made similar points . The euro " will promote low and stable interest rates and low inflation , and encourage prudent fiscal management , " they wrote . <p> But even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain joins . For instance , Continental labor laws make it harder to lay off workers . Personal and corporate taxes are generally higher . As a proportion of national output , British tax revenues account for only 40 percent compared with some 50 percent in Continental Europe . If Britain were forced to emulate other European nations , Mrs. Kenny said , it would mean " higher prices , and more companies going bust . " <p> Indeed , Ralph Robins , chairman of Rolls-Royce , told an audience in Australia that " the last thing we want in Britain is some of the European labor laws appearing in the United Kingdom , and I 'm not just saying that for Rolls-Royce , I 'm saying it for every industrialist in the U.K. " <p> A move in that direction is unlikely because Britain retains a veto over having to impose such measures adopted by the 15-nation European Union . But the anxieties touch the core of Britain 's euro debate , fueling the argument that by joining Britain would cede control over taxes and Government spending . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that taxes need not be uniform . " You have a single currency in the United States , but they have different income , corporate and sales taxes right across the U.S.A. , " he said after meeting with other European finance ministers in Brussels . " So there is no reason why the single currency requires the same tax rates for businesses to be able to work . " <p> But there is no denying that joining the euro means giving up control over interest rates . That leaves individual countries unable to rely on monetary changes to counter economic ups and downs when they are out of step with the rest of Europe , as Britain is today . <p> " There 's going to be a single euro interest rate set by the European Central Bank , " an economist in London said . " While that may be appropriate for Europe as a whole , it may not be appropriate for individual countries . " <p> In Rotherham , some of the arguments seemed arcane , particularly for those who are , as Mr. Davies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting over decimalization , " when Britain abandoned pounds , shillings and pence in favor of decimal currency . That was in 1972 . <p> John Redwood , a Conservative Party foe of the euro , dismissed the Rotherham euro as a " ridiculous stunt . " Not so , Mr. Davies replied . The point was to show that obscure places like Rotherham are ready to deal with euros when necessary . " The issue of whether we join or not , " he said , " is for another day . " <p> Chart : " European Disunion " The euro may shape the fiscal policies of the nations in the monetary union . In Britain , critics of the euro argue that membership would mean that British taxes would go up , more in line with the rest of Europe .
