<p> It started out as a cross between experiment and longing . My husband , Mark , wanted to try out a recreational vehicle as a precursor to an extended national park trip planned for next summer . I just craved warmth . That 's how we ended up with four adults and four children in a seven-person motor home headed to Florida for spring break . <p> If overstuffing an RV and driving 900 miles without stopping was n't foolhardy enough , we also decided to rent a private home from a travel club that provides introductions between vacation home owners and prospective renters . Our decision and deposit were based on one black-and-white photo of the property and one brief conversation with Bill , the owner . Some called us crazy . <p> It was the best vacation we ever had . <p> Minus the RV , that is . <p> Prospective motor home renters should be forewarned that RVs are a lot like boats on asphalt . As soon as I stepped into the rocking vehicle , I knew that the trip would require steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a double dose , I was asleep before we cleared the Springfield , Va. , bypass on I-95 . I awoke somewhere in Georgia . <p> Vero Beach , on the Atlantic Coast , was our destination . I picked it because it was the least amount of driving time to a locale that stood the greatest chance of having bathing-suit weather in late March . ( In fact , the chamber of commerce bills it as the northernmost spot " where the tropics begin . " ) More important , the quaint town of Vero Beach and surrounding areas were reputedly imbued with " old Florida charm . " <p> I am a lover of natural Florida , and our house and location did not disappoint my fantasies . Situated on an extremely narrow stretch of barrier island two miles south of Sebastian Inlet and 10 miles north of Vero Beach , the house had the Atlantic Ocean for a front yard , and the Indian River across the two-lane A1A in the back . <p> Bill , the property owner , was waiting under a gateway arch of intertwined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to park on the side of the road . My sister , the girls and I immediately went off to explore . <p> " This is the best house you ever rented ! " shouted my eldest daughter , Gretchen . " Just like ' Gilligan 's Island , ' " said her sister Rachel . <p> But . . . hmm . What were those looks on the faces of my husband and brother-in-law ? The RV again : Somehow Bill and I in our communications had failed to determine that the motor home would not fit under the beautiful archway guarding the driveway , nor could we park the behemoth on the side of the road . Too narrow . <p> Luckily , the gods were with us . Four miles up the road we found Honest John 's Fish Camp and parked the beast for a mere $ 20 a week . <p> With our new rented car , we were able to explore this slice of paradise , known as the " Treasure Coast " in memory of the 11 Spanish galleons that wrecked on its shores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars , coins and medallions , and sometimes find them . <p> We did n't strike treasure , but we had fun trying : the beaches here are wide and great for walking . Most days we saw less than a half-dozen people , but plenty of herons , egrets and lizards . We were initially alarmed by the snakelike heads poking up through the surf until we learned that we were in the vicinity of the largest sea turtle nesting area in the United States . <p> On the Indian River side of our property , the guys and girls spent most of their days catching sea bass . Between casting lines and sunset parties on this western front , we were entertained by ospreys , pelicans , hermit crabs and manta rays . <p> With some reluctance , we tore ourselves from our tropical wonderland for a couple of excursions . My sister and family made the two-hour trip to Disney World for the day , while my family traveled an hour north to the Kennedy Space Center . I 'm ashamed to say we were not overly thrilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait in line to buy tickets to wait in line to board buses ( to the launch sites ) . We were most impressed by the freeze-dried space dot ice cream , a lone alligator in the reflecting pool and by a bird that built its nest atop a rocket exhibit ( ah , nature conquers , after all ) . <p> We abandoned Cape Canaveral for the surrounding Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge and were duly rewarded . Thousands of alligators live in the refuge ( so many , there 's now a hunting season ) . But we really struck gold with the sighting of a flock of rare roseate ( pink ) spoonbills , which we thought were flamingos until a kindly bird-watcher corrected us . <p> I was determined to see a manatee , and we found a cluster within the refuge at Haulover Canal  --  one of their favored hangouts . <p> On another jaunt , we drove an hour north for an air-boat ride through St. John 's Marsh near Melbourne . The air-boat outfit  --  Camp Holly  --  was vintage cracker Florida . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog lay sleeping atop a picnic table . Inside , a hungry traveler could purchase alligator meat and beef jerky , or , just for fun , dried baby alligator heads on a stick . <p> The refuge boasts some 18,000 of these infamous reptiles , and our guide , complete with crew cut and beer gut , regularly ran them over with the boat . Despite our protestations , he insisted that it did n't hurt them  --  a notion even my 10-year-old found hard to believe . <p> The site favored by locals on the Treasure Coast is Sebastian Inlet State Recreation Area , the place where river meets sea . In addition to being an inexpensive family spot for swimming , snorkeling and boating , the recreation area is considered one of the best surfing sites in Florida . Rangers lead several eco-tours , including nighttime hikes to see loggerhead turtles nest in June and July . <p> The Treasure Coast is so rich in natural beauty and ecological adventures , Disney built its Vero Beach Resort here . Unlike most other Disney properties , this site specializes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and area parks and reserves . And for those with less nature-oriented desires , downtown Vero Beach earns its reputation as quaint . A river runs through it , and the main street is clustered with the requisite cute shops and restaurants . <p> I 'm happy to say that I did not overdose on Dramamine on our return trip home and was , therefore , able to do my fair share of driving , and we made it home in a mere 18 hours . Arriving at 4 a.m. , I opened the passenger door , " At last ! " I cried , forgetting the two-foot drop between step and ground , and landing face first on the green , green grass of home . <p> Washington writer Amy Fries and her family will be renting a Lincoln Town Car on their next vacation . <p> WAYS &; MEANS <p> GETTING THERE : Close to a dozen RV-rental businesses operate in the Washington area ; one of the largest is Cruise America ( 1-800-327-7799 ) . Lots of information is available from the Recreational Vehicle Dealers Association ( 1-800-336-0355 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ //www.rvamerica . com ) . Our seven-person RV cost about $ 1,300 for nine nights , and the directions are easy : Think I-95 . For visits of a week or less , I 'd recommend flying ; US Airways and Southwest fly nonstop to Orlando from Washington and are quoting a round-trip fare of $ 178 , with restrictions . Amtrak 's Auto Train and " Silver Service " passenger trains make the 19-hour trip to Orlando daily ; fares start at $ 258 per person for a round-trip coach seat ( no beds , no car ) : 1-800-872-7245 . <p> WHERE TO STAY : Vero Beach has a variety of accommodations , including family-style motels with kitchenettes . These get repeat visitors , so book early ; listings are available from the Indian River County Chamber of Commerce ( 1-800-338-2678 , Ext. 17802 , http : **30;386;TOOLONG ) . If you want luxury , try Disney 's Vero Beach Resort ( 1-800-359-8000 ) . And for privacy and adventure , Hideaways International ( 1-800-843-4433 ) is the club we went to for our vacation home . The club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fee to join , but trial memberships are sometimes available . <p> WHERE TO EAT : Where we stayed , the restaurant pickings were nonexistent . We stocked up at the grocery store and did some fine home cooking . Both Vero Beach and the town of Sebastian , over the Indian River Bridge , have a wide selection of restaurants , including many with waterfront dining . Check with the county chamber , above .
