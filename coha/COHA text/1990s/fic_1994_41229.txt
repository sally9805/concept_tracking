All of this was in Rolla , Missouri , I remember . We had a nasty little office space in the middle of a shopping center that was going downhill : clean , plastic-smelling carpeting , one window in the outer office , with a view of a parking lot and the highway . Three couples had arrived ; two looked like good bets . The third one , newlyweds , sat against the back wall of the office ; they burped a little when I told them they 'd have to listen to my sales pitch if they wanted their prize , looked me in the eye , folded their arms , nudged each other ; they were n't buyers . The husband in the second couple was maybe seventeen , and his wife was just starting to show , and they looked pleased as apples that I had invited them to take advantage of a terrific opportunity . The first couple had a drooling baby that was so obese it looked goitered . <p> I was on the fourth page of the demo album . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youngest couple , showing them a photo of a couple superimposed on a brandy snifter . " This kind of thing would run you forty , fifty dollars at Owen Mills , but I 've got three pages of coupons that will allow you to get these pictures for just seven dollars apiece . " I told them I had n't had to buy wedding presents for years . I just promised the bride and groom their picture on a brandy snifter , sent the proofs , bingo . <p> " Can you do other stuff , shot glasses and Jack Daniel 's bottles ? ' Cause me and Rhonda do n't drink brandy , " the seventeen-year-old said , and the blonde woman in the back rolled her eyes . <p> " You name it , we can do it . We can put you on a shot glass , a Bud can ; hell-pardon my language  --  we can put you on the stomach of a glass Bambi deer if you want . " <p> I went through the rest of the talk , and the two couples in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get unlimited free film , I told them ; they would pay only for the developing costs . We would airbrush out the red eyes in the pictures if they wanted . They would get one hundred coupons that would allow them to have oil paintings made out of old photographs for only forty dollars apiece ( done by computer to eliminate any possibility of error ) ; one hundred coupons for photo mattings in the shape of hearts , kidneys , bicycles , ovals , houses , and Christmas trees ; two dozen old-photo retouches absolutely free ( done by our experts ) ; and an unlimited supply of plastic photo-protector album pages ; and we would start them out with two hundred free rolls of film . " And I do n't know about you , " I said , pointing at the couple in back , " but I know that you people here with this gorgeous child will tell them that two hundred rolls will last you maybe six months , because you just ca n't have enough pictures of your baby . " <p> The baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is so true . " I gave her a napkin , because the baby was spitting up . The blonde in the back was looking at the ceiling , adding up rolls of film in her head and figuring out that a mortal human being could never use up anywhere close to two hundred rolls of film in six months . <p> Then I got to the tricky part . What we had done , I explained to them , was to add up the actual value of the many options we were giving them at such great savings . Since we had given them forty coupons for oil paintings , which would save them $20 apiece , or $800 , and two hundred free rolls of film at four dollars apiece , which made $800 , they were already ahead by $1,600 . I added up all their savings  --  all the coupons , all the pictures , all the free rolls of film . They would be saving a total of $8,000 . The pregnant girl gasped . " And all we 're asking you to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little . We 're a small company , not much capital , and to give you this kind of bargain we need your help . So we 're going to ask you to pay one tenth  --  that 's right , just ten percent  --  of the total savings you 'll be getting . Just eight hundred dollars . " <p> Then I waited , because they and I had arrived at the ever-loving moment of truth . This is the point where in St. Louis a big black woman shouted , " You mean you are asking us to pay you eight hundred dollars so that we can pay you to develop some pictures ? " <p> I waited just a heartbeat , and while they were still puzzling over all those terrible numbers , I told them about the pricing plan . I told them that they could pay either over a period of three years , though we would charge them interest at a competitive rate , or all at once . " And frankly , " I told them , " I do n't like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just too much of a strain , especially on young people like yourselves , just starting out . " I told the couple in the back  --  the doubters and eye-rollers  --  that they did n't need to stay for this business conference , and I got them out of the room . I told them that I had sent them a complimentary ticket for a free boat , car , camera , or prize to be named later , and that they could turn it in to my wife in the outer office if they wanted to collect their prize . When they were gone , I turned back to the others . The office looked clean , the demo album lay spread open to a picture of an oil painting , water was moving through pipes somewhere in the walls , and I could almost feel the sun setting outside . <p> " I just do n't see how you can afford to give us a deal like this , " the woman with the baby said . <p> " It 's an investment in you , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're willing to pay to get it . " Both couples signed , but the one with the baby did n't leave . The man leaned back in his chair . He was a big man , but something in the way he relaxed made him look especially heavy , like nothing could move him out of that chair . He looked tanned , though his skin was burned in places . His wife stood with the baby on her hip , bouncing it in a quick , nervous way . I felt myself wince every time the baby 's neck jounced up and down . <p> " That is one good-looking child , " I told her . <p> " I think so , but every mother does , " she said . " For all I know , this could be the ugliest baby in the world . The very ugliest . " <p> " You know that 's not true , " her husband said . <p> " Heavens , no  --  that child is an angel , " I said . <p> The woman said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at one another for a minute or two , and her husband shrugged . The baby 's head kept bouncing on its neck . Then the woman made a breathy noise in her throat . " It 's not like you two are experts on beauty or anything . It 's not like anyone elected you two to be God ! " <p> " No , ma'am , " I said . <p> " No , they did n't , " her husband said . <p> The woman was frowning down at the desk , not looking at anyone . She straightened up and smiled . " Since we are practically going into business together , I think we ought to have you and your wife out to the house for dinner , " she said cheerfully . I told them we would n't be able to make it just now , but perhaps in a few months , when we were back in town , we would look in on her to see how the picture deal was working for them . She and her husband shook my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked at their contract and found her signature in a tiny , neat hand at the bottom : Linda Ranier . <p> The pitch always tired me out . All my weight settled in my stomach like lead , I worried about ulcers and blood pressure , and some days I would forget I had already done the pitch , or I would mix up the people in my head and two hours later , at dinner , I would get in a panic , thinking that we had to be at the office to sign someone up . That day I watched through the blinds as the man helped the woman into an old , heavy seventies car . Behind me I could hear Natalie putting their addresses into the computer . Out of four batches of three couples each , we had four contracts , which meant we 'd had a good though not a great day . Natalie had on a red business suit , one of those that are built to shape a woman like an ironworker , but she was tall and thin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gawky elegance . Her hair was long , thick , Spanish hair , so dark and shiny it looked as if it were oiled . She was tapping her foot and chewing gum , and if she was n't doing that , she was looking at her nails . She had never been a real secretary , but the mannerisms were in her genes . <p> " When do you want to bill those four ? " she said . <p> " Wait a couple of weeks , " I told her . " We do n't want them to think that they 're dealing with some fly-by-night operation . " It was the same little joke I used every night , and neither one of us laughed . " God , that was one ugly baby ! " I said . <p> " All babies are ugly at that stage , " she said . " When they get older and talk and walk , they get cuter . " <p> " Yeah , and then they get big enough to pull pans of boiling grease off the stove and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know why anyone would put a pan of boiling grease on a stove with a baby around , " she said . " And anyway , they can choke on apples at any age . You or me could choke on an apple tomorrow . " <p> " Not likely , " I said . I went into the back office and sorted around as if I were looking for something important , because we were rattling along in one of our old ruts , and I knew what was coming next . <p> " I do n't see why we ca n't have a baby , when every other stupid couple that walks through that door has one , " she said . I reminded her that these were the same people who would pay $800 to have their pictures superimposed on a brandy snifter . I told her we would worry about babies sometime further down the road , that she should forget about them . She stared me down , and I told her I would take her out to dinner at the best restaurant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , and we had to clear the walls and desks , and put the pictures and the albums and the computers and the contracts in the van . <p> The company made the money . I had been with them five years , and in the best year I made $30,000 , but I had no expense account and $30,000 does n't go far on the road . We moved every two weeks , found the names of new babies and newlyweds through the state or in town at the courthouse , and mailed our flyer . They learned that they could win a boat , car , camera , or other free gift if they just listened to <p> half-hour sales pitch . Maybe five percent came to see us , enough to set up four three-couple meetings each night for a while . We got maybe a third of the people to sign a contract , and about half of those stopped paying after the first $300 . When they did , we sent them a couple of threatening letters , signed by an attorney ; some coughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and felt happy that they got out of the contract minus only $300 . Nat and I handled all the paperwork , and the company got the money , and after eight years I was supposed to get a job in the office in Kansas City , but I was n't holding my breath . <p> Natalie was nineteen years and a month younger than I was . I had met her at the Stuckey 's in Terre Haute after I 'd been on the road six months . I sat down in a booth and Natalie came over to take my order . She was nineteen then , but she had already finished one marriage , and the tiredness around her eyes made her look older than she was . <p> " Darling , " I said to her , " if you come with me , I guarantee that you will never wear a polyester short dress again . " <p> She smiled and shook her hair away from the pad in her hand . <p> " If you come away with me , I will guarantee you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses running in the fields . " <p> After we talked some more and I finished dinner , I went around the corner to the building where I had my office for the day , and I did two pitches . When I was done , I walked back around the corner and Natalie was there , waiting next to my car . She still had the order pad in her hand , and even from the corner I could see the pages fluttering in the wind . <p> That night in Rolla , after we packed the van , I drove around for an hour looking for a good restaurant . We asked the guy at the motel and he suggested an Italian place and a Chinese place , the Temple of Happiness , but both of them were closed . We ended up at the Waffle House , on a service road next to the interstate . It was crowded and noisy , smelling of diesel and syrup , and when we sat down in a booth , a waitress came over and told us that tonight booths were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to sit at the counter . Nat gave me a look . I put a ten-dollar bill on the table , and the waitress left us two menus . <p> " Well , they do n't have filet mignon , or that 's what I 'd order for you , darling , " I said . <p> " You 're sweet , " she said . <p> " How about a chicken-fried steak ? Best thing on the menu . " <p> " That 's fine . " <p> " And a glass of buttermilk , " I said . " It costs more than coffee , orange juice , or Coke . " <p> " That 's all right . I 'll just have water . " <p> " You sure ? " I said . " We can afford the buttermilk . We got three contracts today . Darling , if you want , we can put your picture on a brandy snifter . " <p> She wanted to smile , but did n't do it . " You know , I do n't even like buttermilk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a little too far back in her throat , and her words came out slowly , carefully , as if her tongue had to study each one before she could say it . She was speaking like that now , but I could not tell just what it meant . When the food came , we ate and talked , about nothing that was of any particular consequence . A few of the truckers at the counter started a loud argument about whores and hemorrhoids and who had had the best and the worst of each . Any kind of vulgar language drove Natalie crazy , and I noticed that after each outburst she would lay her fork across her plate for a minute or two . Some more truckers came in , and the waitresses called them all by name . They wandered around swatting one another with seed caps , and soon even the spaces between the tables were full of laughing , yelling truckers . <p> " Not exactly the romantic evening I had in mind , " I told Nat . <p> We left and drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a bad place . The room smelled like clean wood ash instead of the usual air freshener , coffee in the morning was free , the sheets were mostly cotton , and the toilet did n't rock . When the shades were open , we could see a scrub field that looked too sparse for pasture , and beyond it a Texaco station . I turned on the TV and flipped through the channels . Nat took off her red jacket and blouse , and sat down in her bra on one of the chairs , gazing at the paintings . They were both original art by the motel owner , who did tempera landscapes of the Southwest . Frowning , she looked slowly from one to the other without much interest , the shadowy light from the TV shaping her arms and face , and her shoulders exhausted . A pretty , tired woman sitting on a motel chair . I thought that I had never seen anything sadder . <p> " Something wrong , darling ? " I said . <p> " I just feel dirty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I mean from the things we do , " she said . " Sometimes the things we do to people make me feel dirty . " <p> " Darling , it 's all legal , " I said , but I knew that did not make any difference . " If we did n't take their money , somebody else would . It 's a part of their educational process . " <p> " Sometimes I miss Dorry , " she said . Dorry was one of the girls Nat worked with at the Stuckey 's . They wrote to each other once or twice after Nat came on the road with me , and Nat mentioned her whenever she was really down . <p> " I know you do . " I went over and put my hand on her shoulder . " If you ever get tired of traveling around , we can drive you back home to Terre Haute . " <p> " No ! " she said . I thought for a moment she was going to say " Never . " She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who accepted troubles as they came to her , and I realized that the most impressive thing she had ever done was to leave the Stuckey 's and get in my car . Now she needed that car ; it was the only thing between her and truckers who told hemorrhoid jokes . <p> Someone knocked on the door , and Natalie jumped up and went into the bathroom . <p> It was the Raniers . The baby , crying , was slung in a backpack on Mr. Ranier 's back . <p> " Hello , folks , " I said . " What can I do for you ? " <p> " We want to make the first investment , " Mrs. Ranier said . <p> " Yes ? " <p> " We had to call every motel in town to find out where you were , " Mrs. Ranier said . <p> " We brought three hundred along with us , " Mr. Ranier said . <p> " You know you do n't have to pay until we bill you ? " <p> They nodded . Nat came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to get a receipt ready . " What a lovely baby ! " she said . <p> Mrs. Ranier insisted that Nat hold the baby . The three of them took a minute to wrestle the baby out of the backpack , and it spit up as soon as Nat put it against her chest . Mrs. Ranier suggested that they take it outside to let it get some fresh air . The women left before the receipt was ready , and I had to get it myself . I was going to ask Mr. Ranier how he planned to pay , but before I could , he dug into his pockets and started pulling out stray bills . " I think I 've got enough , " he said , and grinned . He had $120 in tens , and the remainder in fives and ones . We had to flatten out the bills and count them carefully on the bed , since most of them looked as if they had been balled up in the bottoms of his pockets for a month . He had $352 altogether , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call him Pete . <p> Nat and Mrs. Ranier came in after a few minutes , laughing about something the baby had done , and when we finally got the Raniers to leave , after about fifteen minutes , Mrs. Ranier had promised to write and tell us about the baby 's progress . <p> We left Rolla the next day and went to Joplin for two weeks . While we were in Joplin , we got a letter . <p> Dear Mr. Norton , <p> I would like to write to thank you for your fine offer of film since , as you may not know , my Linda and me lost our first baby a year ago . Down to business . I would like , as you promised , another book of two-hundred roll of film free coupons . <p> Friendily yours , <p> Pete Ranier <p> Two other thick envelopes were enclosed in the first . One contained $200 in small bills , and the other had a letter from Mrs. Ranier on the progress of their daughter , Julie , along with four glossy color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said to Nat . <p> She looked over the packet and smiled . " I think it 's sweet . " <p> " Sweet , maybe , " I said . " But why on earth do they need another two hundred coupons ? " <p> " They paid for them , did n't they ? " she said . <p> " Sure they did . But I 've got a trouble meter in my head that tells me these people are n't on the level . " <p> Nat said I was crazy . That night she wrote them a letter saying how much we appreciated their pictures , and she sent it back along with two sheets of a hundred coupons each and a receipt for the money . She also gave them our PO box numbers in Tulsa and Edmond , so that they could find us . When we pulled into Edmond , at the end of August , the Raniers had sent us the balance of the $800 in a brown envelope , along with a picture of Julie superimposed on a glass cradle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long letters to the Raniers . She sent candy and a few small toys , and postcards from all the different cities we visited . She wrote all her letters to Julie , telling her about the highway and about selling pictures to happy people all over Oklahoma . " They 're for Linda , but I think Julie will like the thought , " she said . Linda started addressing her letters to Aunt Natalie , and Nat trimmed down one of the pictures and put it in her pocketbook . I told her she seemed happier . " It 's nice to have something to look forward to when we get into town , " she said . We worked our way toward Amarillo , where the van broke down for a day in the middle of the flat Texas plain . Then we started north , across Kansas . When we got to Kansas City , the baby was trying to stand up , and by the time we crossed the Mississippi , it could walk across the room without help . We decided to make a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing out some of the smaller towns along the way . I did n't like small towns  --  word traveled too fast in them , the people did n't trust easily  --  but Natalie wanted to get back to Rolla to see the baby before it started talking . <p> She sat down and wrote the Raniers a letter . Four , five , six pages she filled up with small print . She fell asleep during the late news , and after I put her to bed , I read over what she had written . <p> Dear Julie , <p> Wanted to be sure and write to you , to tell you that your uncle John and me will be through Rolla sometime in a month or so , and would love to come see you and your parents then . Sorry I have no pictures , am too busy to have them taken ( funny , ha ) . Saw the Miss . River for about the hundredth time the other day , it was muddy and wet as always . This side of the river we stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brand new skirt and pantyhose . Felt like crying as both were ruined and had to change clothes in the gas station bathroom and door would not latch so a woman came in while I was wiping my bare bottom and legs off with paper towels . John thought it was pretty funny , but sometimes little things bother me so much . Feel better today , but rest of that day I thought about jumping out of the car . Right out onto the highway . Did n't do it , though , ha . <p> The rest of the letter was about the Raniers ' home out in the country , and how much Natalie wished we had a house , and how sometimes she thought that I was not the best man in the world but that someday we were going to live in a house with a tree in the yard . I had already forgotten about the spilled gasoline . <p> The company called while we were in Springfield . Apparently one of my contractees was causing a stir . They were supposed to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing , and then send the next one in . Instead this client had sent the company two hundred rolls of film at once for developing , and the kid at the lab , who was supposed to catch problems like that , had let it slip . With developing costs , the contractee had an outstanding bill of $1,4000 The company believed that we had been scammed , that the client was never going to pay a dime , that I was at fault . They would , they said , take the $1,400 out of my commissions if I could n't get the whole mess straightened out . Obviously , the contractee had been farming the free film out to friends or selling it to customers and then dumping it on us . When they told me the name , I was not surprised : Linda Ranier . <p> " Well , Aunt Natalie , " I said , " it looks like your niece and her family have put our ass on the fire . " I explained the situation . <p> " I do n't think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hell they would n't . They saw us coming from farther away than we saw them coming . " She told me she would write them a letter to ask for an explanation ; she was sure someone had made a mistake . <p> " I never did think it was a good idea for you to be writing to a mark , " I said . <p> She looked at me as if I had bitten her . " She 's my friend , John . " <p> " She may be . " <p> " Why do n't you ever let me have any friends ? " <p> I stood behind her , held her face in my two hands , and put my cheek against her hair . " Darling , I want you to have friends . But these people are using us . They are up to something . " <p> " They have the right , " she said . " They signed the contract for the film , did n't they ? It 's all legal , what they 're doing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat fourteen hundred . " <p> " The company will take them to court , " she said . <p> " The company , " I told her , " is not in any position to take anyone to court . " <p> " They 'll pay  --  they paid eight hundred already . " <p> " We 'll see when we get to Rolla . " <p> " You do n't trust anyone , " she said . " They got a little girl . " <p> I left it at that . She wrote them another long letter that night . I did n't read it , and when I went to the post office to mail it the next day , I found another letter from the Ranier woman already in the box , with pictures of the whole family . <p> When we moved the operation back to Rolla , three weeks later , I called the Raniers . Linda got excited when she heard who it was , and she spent a few minutes trying to get Julie to talk into the phone . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her account , and Nat and I wanted to meet with them sometime while we were in town to straighten it out . She muffled the phone , and I could hear her yelling at someone for a minute or so , and then she came back on the line and gave us directions to her house , which was in the hills north of town . <p> From a distance the house did n't look too bad  --  it was white clapboard , with a nice porch that ran around two sides . When we got closer , though , I could see that the porch was coming loose from the roof , tilting away from the rest of the house at a slight angle . The land looked like it had been a farm once , but now the hill behind the house was overgrown with trash shrubs and bull thistles , and the grass in front was two or three feet high , except in big mysterious patches where it had been blasted into bare dirt . <p> I did n't see any junked cars , but two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the doors still on them and slashes of rust down the sides , and what looked like some kind of playground piece , made out of twelve or fifteen old whiskey barrels , was out in front of the house . Some barrels were on their sides , others were nailed to those , and old gray boards were nailed on top of them as a kind of walkway . The whole structure must have been twelve feet high , with the ends of barrels and stray boards sticking off into the air in all directions . <p> " Look at that , " Natalie said . <p> We followed the ruts up to where the path dissolved into one of the patches of dirt , and we parked . I could smell the dry rot of the house when we got out of the car . For as far as I could see , no other sign of human habitation was visible . There were no houses , barns , plowed fields , power lines , or animals ; the road we had come in on was hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same chest-high weed . With the sun shining down on that desolation , it was like a great hazy oven . <p> The front screen door swung open , and someone shouted , " They 're here ! " We both jumped . <p> The woman barged into the yard , dressed in cutoff jeans and an old blue-plaid shirt , her hair tied up in a bandanna . She had a backpack slung over one shoulder , and the baby cradled in her free arm . " Hey ! " she said , smiling . She put the baby down on the ground , in the dirt , and nudged it . " Show them , " she said . " Show Aunt Natalie what a good little walker you can be . " The baby crawled in a circle , trying to get its footing , and the woman took out a camera and crouched down . Sidling around the baby like a crab , so that she could keep herself on a level with the top of the child 's head , she started taking pictures  --  six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally got to its feet , it took two steps and collapsed backward onto its seat and froze , its smiling face posed for another picture . The woman scuttled around and snapped yet another one . Then she picked the child up and walked eight more feet toward us and put the child down again . <p> " Hello , " I said . " Linda ? " <p> " Be with you in just a minute , " she said . Her husband came out on the porch and leaned against one of the posts . He smiled and shook his head happily at us . Mrs. Ranier took four more pictures of the child and then two of us . <p> " Hello , " she said , when she finally brought the kid over to us . She was out of breath , and a smudge of dust was on her nose . <p> " What a sweet baby ! " Natalie said . <p> " She is adorable , " Mrs. Ranier agreed . She looked as if she was about to say something more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she shuddered . <p> " Goodness , are you all right ? " Natalie said . <p> " Oh , fine , " she said . " I just have moments now and again where my train of thought gets derailed . " She laughed in a way that made the hair stand up on the back of my neck . <p> She made Natalie hold the baby while she took pictures of the two of them , and then I had to hold it . I noticed that the baby had a purple welt on the side of its neck . I glanced at Nat ; she gave me a significant look , and I knew she had seen the mark . She was watching Linda carefully , with her hands held out from her sides in a way that struck me as strange , until I realized that she was waiting to be hugged . Linda broke us into groups . I had to take a picture of her and Nat and the baby , then she took one of Nat and me and the baby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up the child for the second time , it fell asleep immediately in my arms . <p> Her husband stepped down one step on the porch . " Linda , why do n't you invite our guests in and let them get out of the sun ? " <p> " Oh , you dear ! " she shouted . " Yes , please come in the house . " <p> We went inside , and Linda announced , " Time for some flash shots ! " I heard the whine of the flash charging up . <p> " Should we arrange ourselves at the table , ma'am ? " I said . <p> She looked at me as though I had said the stupidest thing imaginable . " I only take candid pictures , " she said . " And landscapes . " She took two of Natalie , one of her husband , and finished the roll on the baby , whom I had placed in a crib under the window . Then she unzipped the backpack . It was full of Gold 100-there must have been seventy rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera , putting the spent roll in the outside pocket . <p> We all sat down at the table  --  an old bar table with initials and brands of beer carved into the top  --  and I opened my briefcase . I was rattled , and for a full minute I just stared at the invoices . <p> " Let me just say , Mr. Norton , how much we appreciate what you 've done for us , " Pete began . He went on and on . I had changed their life more than I could know , he told me , and I would never know what a sad person his Linda was before my fine offer , my fine offer completely changed her and made her into the happy person that she was now . As he talked , his eyes filled with tears and he plucked with one hand at the thick black hair on the back of the other . While he was talking , I noticed Linda shiver again the way she had outside . This time she was looking at the camera , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her hand crept out toward it ; she glanced at me and put her head down , but her hand kept going and she pulled the camera toward her . The house was hot , and we all began to sweat . I tried to catch Natalie 's eye , but she was staring at the baby , who was sweating in its crib . All the color had drained out of Nat 's face . She took in the baseboards , which were grayed with scuff marks and dust . The smell of dry rot was even stronger inside the house . Finally Pete 's voice trailed off , and he and his wife sat staring across at each other . <p> " You do n't know how gratifying that is to me , " I told him . Then I hauled out the ledgers and explained that his account was short just over $1,400 , and though I appreciated his promptness in paying off the first $800 , the company just could n't afford to have him carrying such a big debt . I rattled on , meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mean you 're going to take away our free film ? " she said , when I had finished . <p> " No , not at all , " I told her . " But we may need to insist that you pay a certain amount before we can develop any more pictures . " <p> " I work , you know , Mr. Norton , " he told me . <p> " I know that , " I said . " And let me tell you that I care about no one more than the working man . " <p> " Pete works at the distillery , " Linda interrupted . " That 's how he gets those old barrels for free . He likes to say you can get drunk just crawling through one of those barrels , just from the ghosts of the spirits . " She laughed again . <p> Pete got up and went into the other room , and came back with an envelope full of bills . <p> " That 's what we 've got right now , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bills  --  they added up to about $500 . " That will be fine , " I told him , and nudged Natalie under the table to get her to write him a receipt . <p> She looked at me steadily . " Can Julie talk yet ? " she said . <p> " Oh , no , " Linda said . " You saw her  --  she can barely walk yet . She 's not the smartest thing in the world . In fact , if you want to know the truth , sometimes I think she 's stupid , clumsy . Stupid and clumsy . " <p> Pete and I said , " Hey , now , " at the same time . <p> " Well , she 's my angel no matter what , " Linda said . She sat for a moment and then piped up , " I 'm not always this way . " <p> " What way is that , ma'am ? " <p> She had the camera cradled in her lap . " On special occasions you have to take pictures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Absolutely . " <p> She looked over at Pete . " Can we show Aunt Natalie the town ? " <p> " Honey , I do n't think so . " <p> " Oh , come on , " she said . " Ca n't we please show them ? I bet Mr. Norton would like to see too . " <p> Pete ran his hand through his hair . " I do n't think they 'd want to . " <p> " I 'd love to see the town , " Natalie said . <p> We got ready , and Linda led us outside through the tall grass , just to the edge of the clearing with the barrels . " Ticks , ticks , everybody watch for ticks , " she said under her breath . They had a car parked out there  --  an old Impala from the seventies , as big as a bus , and we all climbed into it . <p> " Does the little one have a car seat ? " Natalie asked . <p> Linda did n't answer . Once she had us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julie and hold her up so that her head showed above the edge of the window frame . " Here 's little Jewel , going into town with Aunt and Uncle , " she said . She got pictures from two or three different angles and then switched to the other side of the car and took one from there . <p> They got into the car . " Do n't worry about a car seat , " Pete said . " There 's nothing to hit between here and town anyway . " <p> We started off , with the big car huffing along , hitting sometimes on two and sometimes on three cylinders , threshing down the burdocks and thistles until we dropped into the ruts of the lane . Pete kept the windows sealed to the top ; he claimed that if he just fooled with the knobs long enough the air-conditioning would kick in , and so we all inhaled the gassy smell of the old car . Natalie stared out the window . I looked at the delicate blue veins in the child 's eyelids as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose of her camera up against the side window , snapping the odd picture or two . By the time Pete pulled into an old church 's parking lot , she had finished another roll . <p> " Here we are ! " she said . " First stop . Take one of me first . " She opened our door and took Julie , giving Natalie the camera . " Aunt Natalie has to take this picture . This one will be me and Julie in front of our church . " She and Natalie walked over to the building , a small white house with a cross on the top . Apparently no one had been there in months . <p> " Nice place , " I said to Pete . " Is it Methodist or Baptist or what ? " <p> He touched his chin thoughtfully . " Let me see . I think this one is the Pentecostal or the Kingdom Hall , " he said . " The Methodist is out the other way . I think we 've been over there a time or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to come on and get in the family shots while we had enough light . <p> Next they drove us to the shopping center outside town , a big Wal-Mart complex with a grocery store . " I want to pump gas , " Linda announced . " I think Uncle John should be the cameraman here . " I took pictures of Linda pumping gas at a Mobil station . She posed and preened and brushed her hair back under her bandanna , as if I were a very old friend whom she could flirt with in front of her husband . When that was finished , Linda and Pete and I carried the baby the whole length of the Wal-Mart while Natalie took pictures of the three of us . " The couple , child , and a friend carrying their child , " Linda said . She looked at me . " It 's funny how you can make a whole summer vacation out of an afternoon , " she said . <p> In the store they took more pictures , perhaps three rolls . They took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all had to comment on how much she had grown , on what great progress she was making . Natalie managed to corner me once and asked me to please find a way to make them stop , but I could n't see any way to do it , short of grabbing the camera and smashing it . We moved to the toy section . Julie was finished by this time . She had had nothing to eat or drink all afternoon , and her eyes were glazed with exhaustion . Linda tried to coax the child into a sitting position from where she lay on the tile floor , but Julie would n't move , and the purple doll that Linda tried next only scared her . <p> " I think she 's tired , " Pete said . " It 's probably time to go . " <p> We drove back to their house , with the late-afternoon sun splashing through the windshield . Natalie sat perfectly still all the way back ; every so often she would run her hand over the baby 's head . Linda leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the flash . " Is n't this it wonderful ? " she said . About that time Julie caught her breath and began to wail , and she wailed all the way home . did not blame her . <p> Back at the house they invited us in for dinner , but we declined . Linda gave us each a big hug . " Thank you so much for a wonderful afternoon , " she said . Natalie and I walked without saying a word through the tall grass and blasted patches of dirt to our car . Behind us I could hear the camera shutter and the automatic winder , and the hum of flies and bees in the tall grass , and underneath those noises the sound of the child in the house , a hoarse , continual cry . <p> Nat stopped . " I 'm going to get that baby , " she said , walking toward the house . <p> I grabbed her by the arm . " Time to go , Nat . " <p> Her arm felt limp under my fingers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were as empty as pieces of slate . We got in the car and navigated down the ruts in the yard ; I do n't think I breathed until we were back on the paved road . <p> " Those people were crazy , " she said quietly . <p> " They were odd , " I agreed . <p> We drove along , got on the highway entrance ramp . <p> " Did we do that to them , John ? " she said . <p> " Honey , " I told her , " those people were crazy long before they met us . " <p> " That baby , for God 's sake . Hell ! " <p> She leaned into the car door , her elbow on the armrest and her head pressed against the glass . Her hair was pushed up on top of her head in a way that would have made her look funny if I had not known she was about to cry . I imagined that she was thinking about the road , about how when you have spent enough time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highway and into your mind , and rank after rank of them glare in your eyes and you can not close your eyes hard enough to make them disappear . And about gas stations and motel rooms and broken linoleum tiles and cheap offices that smelled like air freshener . And that every place , after a while , looks alike , and that if she had anyplace to go , she could leave me , and that she should be able to find a way to live that did not leave a steady , dull ache far down in her mind . She was probably thinking other things , too , but I was not sure what those things might be . <p> We drove on into Joplin . We did not have very far to go , but after Natalie fell asleep , the drive seemed to take forever , what with the silence in the car , and the wheels rolling evenly on the road , and the night coming on behind us . <p>             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
