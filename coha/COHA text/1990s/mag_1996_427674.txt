Section : Society <p> The pain is real , but the cause is far from clear . Facing thousands of lawsuits and billions in claims , Dow Corning asks science to solve the best-implant fiasco . ' BY SHARON BEGLEY <p> PERSONAL-INJURY LAWYERS may have survived , though just barely , the drubbing they got when they hauled McDonald 's into court for selling a woman a cup of coffee that scalded her and won a $640,000 jury verdict . But they are going to need all the good PR their contingency fees can buy if they want to survive the breast-implant controversy . Although the scientific evidence on the safety of silicone implants ( mostly breast , but also jaw , limb and others ) is completely unsettled , patients claiming they became grievously ill after receiving implants have won 18 verdicts since 1984 for up to $25 million , and an undisclosed number of out-of-court settlements . Implant manufacturers , in an attempt to put the lawsuits behind them , in 1994 offered to pay out $4.25 billion  --  the largest class-action settlement ever . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease , critics called this court-sanctioned robbery . <p> Things went downhill from there . The class-action settlement fell apart last year . Once again facing more than 19,000 lawsuits , Dow Corning Corp. , which sold about half of all implants , filed for bankruptcy-court protection . But far from settling anything , the legal maneuvers keep setting off new furors . Last week Dow Corning filed a new reorganization plan with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Michigan , with a controversial proviso : no patient claiming that an implant gave her a serious disease would collect unless a " science trial " found that implants can indeed cause systemic disease . <p> A science trial would seem exactly the cure for the " breast-implant fiasco , " as Columbia University law professor David Bernstein called it . Because courts allowed " junk science " into evidence , argues Dr. Marcia Angell in her recent book " Science on Trial , " one woman won millions of dollars from Dow Corning even though her own rheumatologist testified that her symptoms of connective-tissue disease began before she received implants ( other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of what caused a disease . They charged instead that the manufacturers hid research documents , played down the failure rate of breast implants ( at least 5 percent , and possibly 70 ) and told doctors that implants would last a lifetime before quietly amending that to 10 years . What could be more welcome , then , than asking a jury to decide , based on the testimony only of researchers deemed credible by the court , whether silicone can cause debilitating , systemic disease ? And to decide it once and for all ? As Barbara Houser , a Houston attorney for Dow Corning , asks , " Why does it make sense to have this issue tried 8,000 times ? " <p> The Dow Corning proposal reflects a touching faith that science will figure out what a preponderance of evidence implies . But research on silicone implants is anything but definitive : About 1 percent of American women have breast implants . And 1 percent have connective-tissue disease . So , by chance alone , among 100 million adult women , 10,000 will have both . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of their implants or because of other factors ? Two epidemiological studies seem to exonerate silicone . In 1994 researchers at the Mayo Clinic reported a study of 749 Minnesota women who had received implants . They were no more likely to develop 12 connective-tissue diseases than 1,498 women without implants . A study by Harvard Medical School researchers , published last year , analyzed the medical histories of 87,501 nurses . Of the 876 with implants , there was no detectably higher incidence of classic connective-tissue disease . But neither study was conclusive . As Angell concedes , " The Mayo Clinic study sample was not large enough to rule out with reasonable certainty as much as a threefold increased risk " of disease . Still , that would raise the risk of developing connective-tissue disease for a woman with implants from 1 percent to only 3 percent . Similarly , the nurses ' study could not rule out a doubling of risk , to 2 percent . Last February another Harvard study found a " small but statistically significant increased risk " of autoimmune disorders in 10,830 women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disease 24 percent . But this is hardly the smoking gun the plaintiffs have been looking for . The researchers relied on women 's own reports of disease and did not check their claims against medical records . On the other hand , the study looked only for classic , well-defined disorders . As FDA commissioner David Kessler and colleagues argue in a recent paper , " no study has specifically addressed atypical connective tissue disease . " A 1994 survey of animal , cell-culture and immunology experiments by the British government found them " disappointingly poor . " Consider the claim by a Memphis , Tenn. , lab that it could detect in blood samples an immune response to leaked silicone . Last March Dr. V. Leroy Young of Washington University School of Medicine reported sending the lab 12 blood samples that he said came from implant patients ; in fact , they were from women without implants . All 12 came back as testing positive for a reaction to silicone . Saying he is " not proud of this deception , " Young argues that the test for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be clinically useful . " <p> Recent court decisions based on science have favored the manufacturers . In Oregon , a federal district court held hearings this summer at which only " reputable " science was introduced . Judge Robert Jones concluded that there were " no scientifically valid studies " supporting the plaintiffs ' position that " could be submitted to the jury . " And in October two district-court judges in New York ruled , after a weeklong hearing , that the " evidence of both defendants ' and plaintiffs ' experts supports the conclusion that the silicone implants . . . do not cause classical recognized diseases . " <p> This string of legal setbacks , lawyers for implant patients insist , is not why they oppose Dow Corning 's offer of a science trial . They object that the deck seems to be stacked in the company 's favor . If the jury in the science trial decided in favor of the patients  --  agreeing that silicone implants can made recipients grievously sick  --  Dow Corning could still contest whether a specific woman 's illness was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco lawyer representing implant patients , " It would be heads Dow Corning wins , tails the women lose . " Also , lawyers for the women suspect that " Dow Corning is trying to get something through before the science destroys them , " says Philadelphia attorney Stephen Scheller . One study that Dow Corning funded at the University of Michigan , and which is still in the pipeline , looked at 206 people with autoimmune disorders . It finds that those with silicone implants had triple the risk of contracting the disorders of people without implants . <p> The idea of a science trial of silicone is based on the science trial of Bendectin , an anti-morning-sickness drug . The manufacturer faced lawsuits claiming that Bendectin caused birth defects . In 1985 a trial judge allowed science testimony only by recognized experts , and only about reputable , published studies . The jury decided in favor of the company . And in a landmark 1993 ruling , the U.S. Supreme Court agreed that trial courts could and should serve as gatekeepers for scientific evidence , barring fringe science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Houser , " we think we would prevail . " <p> If the jury in a science trial exonerated silicone implants , the looming liability that sent Dow Corning into bankruptcy would be lifted . The company , which reports $250 billion in sales and $247 million in profits this year , could emerge as robust as ever . But the plaintiffs ' attorneys have no intention of letting Dow Corning off the hook . They are negotiating an alternative plan . First they want Dow Corning to make available more than the $600 million it has earmarked for women with localized problems from implants , such as hardening of tissue or infections due to leakage or rupture of the implant . That amount , says Sybil Goldrich , cofounder of an implant-information clearinghouse , would not cover the surgical costs of removing them from an estimated 300,000 patients with Dow Corning implants . Patients ' attorneys are also likely to propose 30 or so trials  --  not just one  --  to decide whether Dow Corning 's implants made women ill . The results would be used to guide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be made available to patients . Fiasco or not , the breast-implant controversy will plague both science and the courts a while longer .
