IF A TORNADO IS NATURE 'S EQUIVALENT OF A DRIVE-by shooting  --  random and deadly  --  then the pair of storm systems that spun dozens of deadly twisters across 12 states , killing 25 and injuring hundreds , resembled a devastating artillery barrage . One trailer park in Rankin County , Mississippi , looked every bit the target of a heavy shelling after a twister roared through it . The storm , unleashing winds of more than 200 m.p.h. , tossed one trailer 150 yds. , wrapped another 's heavy steel frame around a tree trunk like a coat hanger , lodged an empty refrigerator high in a pine tree and left the forest strung with the sad confetti of broken lives : blankets , clothes and magazines . Said one Vietnam vet as he surveyed the site : " This looks like Hamburger Hill . " <P> The scene was repeated from Texas to Ohio and Maryland as the freak storms , caused by a southerly dip in the jet stream that slammed cold Canadian air against warm , moist air from the Gulf of Mexico , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus full of children off a road in North Carolina ( five kids and the driver were admitted to a hospital ) and tore the steeple from a Georgia church as the congregation sang Amazing Grace . Still , in Florence , Mississippi , fate smiled on a six-day-old girl , ripped from her father 's arms when a twister hit their mobile home . She was found 40 minutes later in the underbrush , wet and scratched  --  but alive .
