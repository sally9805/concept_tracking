The Living Word was Jerome 's bookstore . It was a cubbyhole , a small room jammed with Bibles , inspirational books , and cards for religious occasions ; and it was located in a Long Island shopping plaza , between a record store and a bridal boutique that had gone out of business months earlier and was about to reopen as one of a chain of restaurant-bars that catered to college students . On the street outside The Living Word , Jerome stared through the restaurant windows as a crew of workers prepared for opening night . From the ceiling , King Kong hung vertically suspended , one huge hairy arm swiping at a biplane dangling from a rafter just out of reach . His other arm was wrapped around a red supporting column , as if he were leaning out from it , holding on to keep from falling . A scantily clad Fay Wray trapped in Kong 's grip pressed the back of her hand to her forehead , on the verge of fainting . <p> From behind him , Jerome heard the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice waving for him to come into the record shop . Alice was the sales clerk and manager . At twenty-two she was only a couple of years older than his youngest daughter , but that did n't keep her from flirting . With the tip of her finger , seductively , she pushed her black , buttonless , boat-top blouse down off one shoulder . Jerome put his hands on his hips and frowned at her . In response , she pouted elaborately , making her bottom lip quiver as if she were about to cry Jerome laughed and went into the record shop . <p> " When are you going to stop playacting Jezebel ? " he said , as soon as he pushed open the door . <p> " Do n't start . " Alice pulled her blouse back over her shoulder , and glanced up at a large concave mirror suspended above her head like a satellite dish . There were no customers in the store . " I have a favor to ask . " <p> " What ? " <p> " Take me out tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm serious . Just for a couple of hours . Your wife 'll never find out . " <p> Alice sat behind the counter on a barstool , her hands in her lap , her black jeans and black blouse contrasting sharply with fair skin and platinum-blond hair cut short as a man 's . Jerome stared at her for a long moment , waiting for something in her expression to give her away , but she returned his stare unflinchingly , and in the end he could n't tell if she were kidding with him as usual or if she were serious . He said , as if trying to understand : " You want me to take you out tonight . " <p> She nodded , expressing exaggerated amazement at his lack of comprehension . <p> " Where ? " <p> " Next door . The new place . I want to drop acid . " <p> Jerome laughed again , this time throwing his head back and folding his hands over his belly , <p> " Cut it out . " Alice pursed her lips . Her slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her forehead gave her a birdlike look , her hair like a bird 's cap . <p> " What ? " Jerome said . " You 're not serious ? " <p> " You did it ! " Alice 's voice traveled up an octave . " You did drugs ! You were wild ! " <p> " That was twenty-five years ago , " Jerome said . " I told you like a warning , not like you should try it . " <p> " Well , that 's not the way I heard it . I 'm serious . I want you to take me out tonight . " <p> Jerome went behind the counter . He stood in front of Alice and took her hands in his . Their image was reflected in the concave mirror . Jerome was a tall , heavy man , bearlike in build , wearing a plain white shirt and blue jeans held up by bright red suspenders . His long graying hair was pulled back neatly in a ponytail , and he had a gold-crucifix earring in his pierced right ear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward on her counter stool . " Alice , " Jerome said . " You do n't want to drop acid . Believe me . Drugs will only make your life more of a mess . " <p> " Bullshit , " Alice said . " My life ca n't be any more of a mess . " <p> Jerome knew what Alice was talking about . She was in love with <p> performance artist from Brooklyn who called himself St. John of the Five Boroughs . They had been going out for over a year when he abruptly dumped her . He said she was too bourgeois , too middle-class . This happened a few months ago , shortly after Alice mentioned the possibility of marriage . Jerome felt a twinge of guilt over this , since Alice had met St. John in The Living Word , where she had been visiting when he came in to buy a Bible and a crucifix for use in one of his performances . When he left he had Alice 's phone number . " Look , " Jerome said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alice pulled her hands away . " Jesus . " <p> " Forgive me , " Jerome said . " I am fifty-two years old . " <p> Alice said plaintively , " My father would be fifty-five if he were n't dead . " <p> Jerome covered his eyes with one hand , and his chin dropped to his chest . " Alice , " he said . " You 're letting yourself get carried away . " <p> " Am not . " She jerked his hand away from his eyes . " All I want to do is drop some acid . I want to shake up my life . " <p> " So what do you need me for ? " <p> " I trust you . You 've got experience . " <p> " Go with your mother . " Jerome walked back around the counter . He glanced at the rows of CDs that filled the shop , at the brightly colored , rectangular packages . A mostly nude Prince reclined beside a rap CD that pictured four men totally naked except for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " My mom 's in St. Thomas with her latest . " <p> Jerome stepped between the two waist-high , black columns that would set off an alarm if he tried to leave without paying for a CD . " Alice , " he said . " Stop feeling sorry for yourself . And do n't be stupid and take a chance on screwing up your life " He pulled the door open halfway and a soft , electronic chime sounded . <p> Alice leaned forward to the counter and propped her chin up in her hands . " I 'll be there tonight around midnight , " she said . " I 'll feel better if you 're there . I mean , I 'll understand if you ca n't . But I 'm dropping acid tonight no matter . I already decided . " <p> " Mistake , " Jerome said . " Big mistake . " He left the shop . <p> The rest of the day , Jerome straightened out and dusted off stock in the Living Word . He moved a new edition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , next to a T-shirt that had a black handprint with a red circle in the center of the palm . At five o'clock , from behind his counter , he watched Alice pull down the metal gate over her storefront and insert and turn the keys that activated the alarm system . When she turned around and saw him looking at her , she mouthed the word midnight , winked , and crossed the parking lot to her car . As she walked away from him , Jerome 's eyes fell to her legs . He noticed every crease in her jeans and the movement of her body within her clothes . His breathing slowed a little . He did n't turn away until Alice unlocked her car door and stepped out of sight . In front of him on the counter , a collection of art on religious themes was opened to a portrait of his namesake : Leonardo da Vinci 's The Penitent Jerome . He stared for a moment at the saint 's wasted body before snapping the thick book closed with a loud clap . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her physically , produced a kind of heat inside him , a kind of heat that could only be released by touch . He had been married now for a little over twenty years . He had two daughters in college . He thought he had grown past the real desire for other women . He would always notice other women , he knew that . He would always be aware of their bodies , of he way they moved  --  but there was a line between noticing and wanting , and it was a line he did n't want to cross . When he was a young man , he had slept with every woman he could get into his bed . He had been a jazz musician , he played sax , and he lived for only two things : women and music . When he was n't doing one or the other , he was doing drugs : mostly marijuana and hashish , but coke too , and some horse . He could still see himself walking along Houston Street toward the Village . He walked with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place way over on Broome Street and he 'd cut across on Essex and walk down Houston into the Village , like there was a spotlight on him all he way . When he got to whatever club he was working , when he played his sax , he fell into a deep place . He 'd play with the group , whatever they were doing , a lot of Dizzy , " A Night in Tunisia , " " Groovin ' High , " a lot of Miles , and he 'd be with them , one star in a cluster , one piece of light , and then something would happen , he 'd break out , flare up and the guys would back off and let him play . That 's what jazz was like when it was good . That was why he did it . He 'd be playing and then something just happened , he flew away , he 'd be unconscious , flying , he 'd get high soaring up to a place and then he 'd level off and coast back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lights , and the audience would applaud and the guys would throw him a nod , a little gesture that said yes , he had been out there . <p> That was the good part . But the good part was tied up with the bad part in a way he could never understand . Anger was the bad part . Something that was anger and more than anger . At first it was only there in the morning . He 'd wake up with it . He 'd get out of bed , his senses raw , like his nerves were all exposed , something heavy wrapped around him like a smoldering robe . He was n't sure where it came from , he was n't sure it mattered . There were his father and mother , who hardly seemed to notice him . He was the youngest of six children , they did n't have time . There was his career as a musician , the next step just not coming , the recording contracts , the money and fame . That did n't matter , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing others move up while he stayed behind . But it was more than that . It was something inside him furious , something enraged He could n't rest , the anger pressed against his skin . It seeped into every part of his life . Then in 1972 he beat up a woman he had picked up after playing a club . He beat her up after having sex with her . <p> They had been lying together on his single bed . It was a summer night , the window next to the bed was open . There was a straight-back chair beside the window , and it was covered with clothes : several shirts were draped over the back , and pants were hung over the shirts . The seat was piled high with dirty clothes . From his bed , where he lay on his side , knees pulled up to his chest , he stared at the chair and at the buildings beyond the window . There was no breeze . The air was heavy . The sheets under him were wet from the sweat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face and neck . It was near dawn : he had n't quit playing till after two A.M. The moon must have been bright , because he could see the building out the window clearly . He was thin in those days , thin and wiry . The woman who lay behind him was tracing the outline of his ribs with a fingertip . She followed the hard bone from the side to the center of his chest and back and then down to the next one . She lay behind him , so she could n't see that his teeth were pressed together , that the corded muscles down his neck and to his shoulders were tight and hard . He had been doing blackbirds , thick amphetamine capsules , he could n't remember how many . He was crashing , he told himself he was crashing , to hold on . Who was he ? Who was the woman behind him touching him ? Why did he want to slap her hand away , a minute ago he had been driving himself into her ? Her touch was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He told himself he was crashing , he told himself to hold on : who was he , he was thirty-two years old , he was floating away he was sinking under , he was a musician , he was in bed with a woman he had met a few hours earlier , she was tracing the outline of his ribs with a fingertip . He was crashing . If he could hold on . He wanted to cry and he had no idea why he wanted to cry . He told himself it was the speed , but he felt lost , even though he knew exactly where he was : in the same apartment he had lived in then for five years , on Broome Street in Manhattan , in walking distance of the clubs where he played . He felt trapped , locked up , even though he knew he was free to do whatever he wanted , he had the money he needed , he had the access to drugs , there were women to spend the night . His body began to shudder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outline of his ribs , her hand went down lower , to touch him . She bit him gently , taking the flesh in the small of his back between her teeth . He turned around . Her eyes were glistening , playful . He hit her the first time when she leaned forward to kiss him . He said , " Do n't touch me . " She was more surprised then hurt . He had n't hit her hard . He had slapped her . She said , " You ... " and faltered . She hit him back , a half-slap , half-push at his chest , and something huge inside him flared white and hot and he flailed at her , beating her , kneeling over her and striking until her body stopped resisting , the flesh went soft under his fists . <p> He spent a week in jail . There was no trial . His lawyer bargained with the city 's lawyer and he got off with a suspended sentence . During his week in jail , he spent most of his time on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barred window at the sky . The night of the beating he had crawled away from the bed on all fours . The nightmare image of himself crawling naked away from the bed was locked into Jerome 's memory . It had never gone away , in all the twenty years since : the image of her startled eyes when he first slapped her , the feel of her body breaking under his fists , the animal explosion of grunts and screams from her and from him . Sometime long after she had stopped screaming , he crawled to the window . He had blood on his hands and face . He pulled himself up and looked out : the world was pulsing like the skin of a creature whose heart was beating hard . Color vibrated . The stars were white flames that flared like drumbeats . In jail it was different : colors settled , stars cooled . <p> After they let him out , he began raking long walks at night , and on one of his walks , he wound up all the way downtown , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was cold , and he was coming up on Trinity Church . A thin , haggard man with long , windblown hair . The building was open . He entered through the central portal , and when he pushed open the inner doors and stepped into the interior , he was looking along the aisle toward the altar , where Christ looked down at him from the cross . He had n't been in a church since he was a boy . He had been raised Roman Catholic . He had been baptized and had received communion , and that had been the end of it . Twenty , maybe twenty-two years since he 'd been inside a church . He genuflected , crossed himself , and walked to the altar , where he knelt and lay his head on the chancel rail . He did n't know what he wanted . He was sobbing , and when he looked up again at the cross , he felt something warm and calming spread though him . He thought it might be the memory of himself as a boy in church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers and sisters , watching the priest say mass , hold the gold chalice up to the light from a stained-glass window , as if offering it to the light , offering the chalice up to the light as if the light were alive and might take the chalice from his hand . He had felt warm then and safe and that feeling returned to him there at the chancel rail in Trinity Church . But it felt like something more than memory , like his anger was being transformed : bile turned to honey . After that , everything changed . He started going to confession every week and receiving communion every morning . He quit playing the clubs . He quit taking drugs . He met Sylvia and got married . They opened a Christian bookstore on Sixth Avenue . When they had a child , they moved the bookstore to Long Island . <p> Jerome put the art book in the display window , next to the C.S. Lewis , and then closed up the shop and went home . He found Sylvia in the kitchen pounding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded by food : a caldron of tomato sauce bubbled on the stove ; in the half-opened oven , two apple pies cooled ; on the counter beside her , bottles of spices were scattered among piles of raisins and pignoli . The tangy apple-pie smell overwhelmed the small kitchen " What 's this ? " Jerome said . He put his hand on the counter and it slid over a slippery film of baking flour . <p> " This ? " Sylvia pointed at the beef . " It 's braciole . " <p> " No . I mean all of this . " Jerome clapped his hands and a little cloud of flour dust floated slowly to the floor . <p> Sylvia shrugged and made a gesture with her hands as if to say she did n't know why he would ask . " I 'm cooking , " she said . She rinsed her hands in the sink and dried them on a green dish towel that pictured a line of geese flying in formation . She hung the towel over the faucet , held Jerome by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just because the kids are gone does n't mean I ca n't cook anymore . I like cooking . " <p> Jerome stepped around her and looked into the pot of sauce . " There 's enough here for a month . " He went to the kitchen window and looked out into the yard . In the reflection from the window , he could see Sylvia standing with her hands on her hips , looking at his back . Her expression wavered between anger and concern . In the twenty years they had been married , she had grown stout  --  not fat , but stout , almost matronly . She had turned fifty a week earlier , and last month , Beth , their youngest , had left for college : that , Jerome told himself , was why she was making a meal big enough for an army . <p> " Did you go to mass this morning ? " she asked . " Did you receive communion ? " <p> Jerome closed his eyes and leaned forward until his forehead touched the window . The glass was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Sylvia claimed she could tell a difference in Jerome 's behavior on the rare days when he missed mass and communion  --  probably not more than a dozen in the past twenty years . She said he got edgy and tense and hard to live with . He walked out of the kitchen without answering , and sat in the recliner in front of the living room 's bay window . The house around him was orderly and neat , as always , and as always he found that calming . The polished hardwood floors gave off a kind of warmth , and Jerome leaned back and settled into the comfortable familiarity of his surroundings . <p> From the kitchen , Sylvia called : " Do you want a glass of wine ? " <p> He did n't answer . She was right about church : he began his day with mass and communion the way other people started theirs with coffee and the newspaper . If he missed mass , he was off-balance the rest of the day . When he received communion , when he knelt at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the priest , and the priest placed the wafer of the host on his tongue  --  when he received the body and blood of Christ into his own body , he felt transformed . He felt himself change as the wafer dissolved on his tongue : a warming light seeped into the dark places in his body . But he had n't missed morning mass . He had gone at six A.M. , as always . He sat in his regular seat in the back of the church , under the stained glass window portraying Christ 's heart surrounded by a fiery light , and he had received communion . <p> The bay window in front of the recliner was lined with shelves crowded with knickknacks . Jerome picked up a soapstone sculpture of a dolphin and held it in his open hand . He liked the soft , doughlike feel of the stone in his palm , the warmth it had absorbed from sitting under the window radiating into his hand . He touched the dolphin to his forehead and held it there a moment , his eyes closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into the kitchen . Sylvia was pouring sauce into jars . She had bright blue potholder mitts over both hands . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I 'm acting sullen . " <p> " What 's wrong ? " Sylvia put the pot back on the stove . <p> He hugged Sylvia and kissed her on the cheek . " I think it 's Beth ... the kids being gone . " <p> Sylvia nodded . Her eyes got teary . <p> " I think I 'll go for one of my walks after dinner . " <p> " It 's getting cold out , " she said . She returned to pouring sauce into jars . <p> Jerome leaned back against the sink . " Then maybe I 'll go for a drive , " he said , casually . " Later on . " <p> After dinner , he watched television with Sylvia . When the eleven o'clock news ended , and Sylvia started upstairs for bed , he told her he was n't sleepy , and that he thought he 'd go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Sylvia continued up the stairs slowly , without replying . Then she joined him where he was sitting on the couch . " Are you sure you would n't rather talk ? " She put her hand on his knee . <p> " It 's not talk , " he said . " You know how I get . A long walk or a drive soothes me . " <p> " O.K. If you 're sure . " She leaned forward and kissed him on the cheek . " But try not to wake me when you come back in . You know what happens if I wake up once I 've gone to bed for the night . " <p> " I 'll be quiet . " He watched Sylvia walk up the stairs , and he listened while she prepared for bed . From where he sat on the couch , he could hear the floor creaking over his head , and each sound told him where she was in the bedroom and what she was doing . The silence meant she was standing in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The floor creaking again meant she was walking to the bed and pulling back the quilt . He waited until she was in bed a few minutes before getting up from the couch and getting dressed to go out . When he left , he pulled the door closed with a loud click , and he rapidly turned the key in the lock so that the dead bolt would snap closed loudly . By the time he started the car , it was midnight . <p> Jerome had n't been inside the bar for more than a few seconds when he heard his name being called from someplace over his head . The place was jammed with kids who did n't look like they could possibly be twenty-one , though that was the drinking age in New York Alongside him , two girls were holding each other at arms ' length and squealing with delight as they looked each other over and prepared to embrace . When he looked up , Jerome saw Alice leaning over a railing and waving to him . He smiled up at her just as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a fortune teller in a glass case . Jerome would have grabbed the kid if the crush of bodies had n't closed around him instantly . He leaned against the glass case as the fortune teller , apparently jolted into action by the collision , began mechanically dealing out a hand of tarot cards , accompanied by an eerie , high-pitched , violin music . He turned away from the black-clad , wizened features of the gypsy-dummy , and stood on his toes , trying to locate the stairway that led up to the second level . Before he could find it , Alice popped out of the crowd behind him and took his arm . <p> " I already dropped , I do n't feel anything yet , I 'm glad you came . " She jumped up and kissed him on his forehead . " I thought you 'd come , " she said . <p> " Is there someplace to sit ? " <p> Alice pulled Jerome through the crowd , toward the back of the bar . The decor of the place was overwhelming , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a glass-encased statue of Elton John ; Marilyn Monroe standing on a subway grating , her dress blowing up as she tries to hold it down ; a portrait of Charles Barkley wearing a T-shirt that advertised Nike sneakers and read : " The meek shall inherit the earth ... but they do n't get the ball . " The place was packed with stuff that ranged from an antique Amoco gas pump to a full-size , red-and-white ' 57 Chevy with an Elvis manikin in the driver 's seat , to an old-fashioned round clock on a lamppole , the kind you might have found in a railroad terminal or even on some town 's main street , before they were universally replaced with digital time-temperature displays . And overlooking it all was the massive King Kong , Fay Wray in hand . <p> As they made their way toward the back of the bar , the crowd thinned and the noise level decreased significantly . Jerome realized there was music coming through a PA system : Ella Fitzgerald was scatting her way toward the end of " Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit , the Fitzgerald number was over and Talking Heads were on . Jerome slid into a booth that was enclosed on three sides , like a small private room with a wall missing . Alice sat across from him . Over her head , light from an adjoining booth filtered through a round , multicolored , stained-glass window . A waiter appeared almost instantly . Alice ordered an Irish coffee and Jerome ordered bourbon . <p> " So how come you came ? " Alice asked , smiling . Then , before he could answer , she leaned over the table and her smile turned into a grin " But I knew you 'd come . I could tell . " <p> " I came to talk you out of the acid . " <p> " Uh uh , " Alice said . " That 's not it . Do n't bum me out . I want this to be a good trip . " She reached across the table and put her hand over his . " It 's weird , " she continued . " You look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of years now , right  --  but I 've never seen you except in my shop or yours . You definitely look different . " <p> " Who would n't look different here ? Jerome gestured toward a group of skeletons playing soccer . <p> " These are big tripping bars , " Alice said . " That 's what gave me the idea . I used to go to one of these in the city with John and everybody was always tripping . " <p> " Not hard to understand . " <p> " Well ? Do you know why you came ? " <p> The waiter showed up with their drinks before Jerome could answer . Alice put a twenty on his tray . " We 're not staying long , " she said . The waiter told her he 'd be right back with the change . <p> " Alice ... " <p> " What ? " <p> " I do n't know what you 're thinking . I 'm ... " <p> Alice 's Irish coffee came topped with a pyramid of whipped cream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one swipe of her tongue . " You would n't be here if you were n't interested . That 's something John taught me . To cut through the pretense . " <p> The waiter returned with the change . When he left , Jerome said to Alice : " I 'm worried about you doing acid . " <p> " I do n't think so . I mean , maybe that 's why you think you 're here ... " Alice appeared to weaken slightly , as if some of her confidence were slipping away . Then she crossed her arms on the table and leaned close to him . " Come on , Jerome . You 've been staring at me for two years . I 'm already tripping , so do n't play mind games with me . I know you 're interested . I can tell by your look . It does n't matter what you say , you can act like my uncle all you want . Your eyes do n't lie . " <p> " But it does matter what I say . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You ca n't hide what 's in your heart . " <p> Jerome picked up his bourbon . " It 's not my heart .... I 'm not trying to hide my heart . " <p> " You 're screwing around with me . You 're playing with my mind . " Her eyes got teary . " Now I 'm getting scared . I 'm getting bummed out . " <p> Jerome reached across the table to touch her . <p> " Shit . " She covered her face with her hands . " John does acid all the time . He says the world is like a mask that acid burns away . When he does acid he can see what 's under the mask . " <p> " What 's he see ? " <p> Alice shrugged . " I do n't know . I 'm getting scared . " She took her hands away from her face . Her cheeks were wet and her mascara was smeared . Black lines ran down from her eyes like soiled tears . " I do acid once and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and covered her face again . <p> Jerome touched her arm and found her muscles tense . He tried gently to pull her hands away from her face , but it was like pulling on the arms of a stone sculpture . He moved around the table to sit beside her . " Alice , " he said . He put his arm around her . " Are you all right ? " <p> She shook her head . <p> Jerome took her wrists in his hands and pulled her arms down . Her lips were opened slightly and her teeth were pressed together . She appeared to be staring at something that was n't there . Jerome held her face in his hands . He tried to turn her head to look at him , but she resisted . <p> " I 'm scared , " she said through clenched teeth . " I 'm really scared . " <p> " Of what ? " Jerome leaned back into the table , trying to get Alice to look at him . <p> " I do n't know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerome 's , and some of the stiffness went out of her . <p> " Why do n't we leave , " Jerome said . <p> " Will you take me home ? " <p> " Yes . I 'll take you home . " He put his hand under her arm and guided her out of the restaurant and to his car . It was a clear night , the sky bright with stars . Once Jerome was on the road , Alice lay down on the front seat and rested her head on his thigh . He stiffened at first . Then he saw beads of sweat on Alice 's upper lip and her forehead , and he wiped them away with the palm of his hand . He asked , " Are you feeling any better ? " <p> Alice nodded . " I do n't know what happened , " she said . " This feeling just came over me , like something terrible was all around me  --  like in nightmares when I was little and I knew something horrible was right behind me but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone now ? " <p> " Almost , " she said . " It 's melting away . I saw your eyes and it started . It 's like melting away , it 's almost all gone . " <p> " You 're high , " Jerome said . " It 's the drug . " <p> " It 's different . " She nestled her head into his thigh and stomach as if he were a pillow . " I do n't feel high . I do n't feel all messed up . I feel clear . It 's like something warm is spreading through me , melting away everything bad . " <p> " You 're high , " Jerome repeated . <p> Alice pointed up , out windshield . " Look at the stars , " she said . " How bright . " <p> Jerome had to lean down a bit so that he could look up out the window . " There 's nothing there . The light we 're seeing , whatever made it , it was billions of years ago . There 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then back out the window . " What makes you so religious , Jerome ? What makes you a religious man ? " <p> Jerome was quiet . He looked down at Alice and saw that she was examining her hand . She held her opened hand in front of her face and moved her fingers slowly , as if she were playing a piano in slow motion . Her eyes were full of wonder . " I 'm thankful , " Jerome said . " I feel like ... " He did n't know how to continue . <p> " I know what you mean , " Alice said , still examining the workings of her hand . " It 's just like feeling thankful that makes you good . " Then she pulled herself up suddenly , and knelt beside Jerome . She kissed him . " But we 're going to be bad tonight , " she said . " Just this once . We 're going to be so bad we 're good . " <p> Jerome pulled the car into the entrance to Alice 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space . Once they were out of the car and on the concrete walk that led to her apartment , Jerome put his hand on the small of Alice 's back . " Are you feeling any steadier ? " <p> Alice reached behind her and took Jerome 's hand and slid it down into the back pocket of her jeans . She held her hand over his . " I like it better there . " <p> Under his palm Jerome could feel the liquid smoothness and warmth of Alice 's body moving . Energy flowed into him : his heart beat faster , his thoughts scattered and bounced , like molecules of water heating up in a bowl . His breathing changed , became more rapid , so that he knew if he tried to speak a whole sentence the final words would be clipped or chopped off entirely . He did n't speak . He kept his hand in her back pocket as they walked up a flight of stairs . Alice leaned into him , her head against his chest . At the door , she produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having to unlock the door wearied her . When she had trouble getting the key into the lock , she seemed surprised . <p> Jerome steadied Alice 's hand with his own . He unlocked the door , pushed it open , and stepped into her apartment . The place was small , essentially one room divided into a living area and a kitchen . There were two open doors off a short hallway beyond the living room : one led to a bedroom , the double bed unmade , sheets and bedspread crumpled on the floor ; and the other opened into a bathroom . <p> " Sit down . " Alice gestured toward a frayed couch strewn with clothes . As she pointed , a brindled cat darted out of nowhere , between her legs , and jumped up onto the counter that separated the kitchen and living room . The cat startled her , and she lost her balance . She would have fallen if Jerome had n't caught her . " Whoa , " she said . " Maybe I am stoned . " She looked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She squinted and looked at a spot on the wall over the couch . " Does acid build ? Like keep getting stronger ? " <p> " I ca n't remember , " Jerome said . He was standing behind her now , letting her lean back against him . " It 's been more than twenty years . " <p> Alice was staring at the same spot . She said , " I think the walls are breathing , " and then she laughed . " No , " she said . " I 'm O.K. " She turned to face Jerome and put her arms around his waist . " I do n't feel stoned . " She stood on her toes and kissed him on the lips . " Wait here . " She walked off , down the hallway . With her hand on a doorknob , she stopped and turned around , and looked back at Jerome . The hallway was dimly lit , and in its shadows Alice 's features seemed softer , almost flawless : her skin not dark in contrast to her white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exotic , a native of a tropical island . " I feel like ... in harmony with things . I feel a ... connection .... Like , " she said , speaking slowly , each word taking its own good time , " right now I 'm feeling like everything is a kind of moving quilt , and I 'm one piece of the quilt over here , and you 're another piece over there . " She smiled , her eyes catching Jerome 's eyes , and then she disappeared into her bedroom , closing the door behind her . <p> Inside his head , a voice asked Jerome what he was doing . Jerome said he did n't know . He pushed a terry-cloth robe aside and sat down heavily on the couch . His heart was still beating hard . His skin felt prickly . Across the room , the cat was perched on the counter watching him , its tail resting on what appeared to be a stick of butter . Again the voice inside his head asked him what he was doing , and Jerome answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem possible that he would actually go to bed with Alice , and it did n't seem possible that he would n't . What 's the truth , he asked himself , and he answered that he wanted to sleep with her , he wanted to touch her , he wanted to enter her and feel each movement of her body deep inside him , and he wanted her to feel him , he wanted her hands and lips to touch him . That 's the truth , he told himself ; and then he told himself that he was n't going to . When he asked why not , he had no good answer . He was n't the same man who once put a woman in the hospital , who once crawled away from sex with blood on his hands and face . That man was long gone . That was n't what would keep him out of her bed . And it was n't his wife or his family or his religion , though those thoughts were there : Sylvia sleeping on her side , her hands folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliding open the window between the chambers and waiting for Jerome to speak ; his daughters as children , as young women now off in college , away from home . Those thoughts were there but they felt powerless , weak as sunlight at dusk . If he did n't do it , it would be because he just did n't anymore . It was n't the way he lived . When this answer came to Jerome , he laughed at himself , and not a pleasant laugh , but a laugh that carried a note of disdain . <p> Across the room , the cat leapt down from the counter , jumped onto a ledge and slithered out a barely open window . The apartment was dead . Jerome realized that a long time had passed since Alice went into the bedroom . It occurred to him that something might have happened to her . He knocked on her bedroom door . When she did n't answer , he went hesitantly into the room . She was lying on a wide ledge under a long double window . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking up at the stars . In the flickering light from a red candle burning on top of a white plastic dresser , she looked like the woman in a magic act , the one the magician makes float up on thin air . When Jerome knelt alongside her , he saw that she was naked under the sheet , the thin fabric clinging to her body , taking on the texture of her skin . She was breathing very slowly , her chest hardly moving . Her eyes were fixed on the sky . Jerome touched her shoulder , and she whispered , barely audibly , " There 's nothing there . " <p> It took Jerome a moment before he realized she was talking about the stars , about the starlight . <p> She turned to look at Jerome . " You can touch me . If you want to . " <p> He touched the palm of his hand to her cheek . Alice turned back to the window " I 'm someplace special , " she said . <p> " I 'm someplace strange . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed her on the forehead and left her staring out the window , her eyes moving from star to star . Half an hour later he was back in his own bed , lying quietly under a spread next to Sylvia . Her body was warm and he edged closer to her . His heart was beating slowly now , steady and calm . His thoughts felt clear and solid . Alice was young . She was alone and drugged looking out her bedroom window at the stars . He was with his wife and sober , looking , now , out his own bedroom window , at the same stars . They were different and they were the same , the three of them , everyone , wrapped in urging bodies , under the dead light of the stars . <p>
