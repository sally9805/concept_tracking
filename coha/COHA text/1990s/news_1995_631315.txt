Green Cars , Clean Fuel " Road-Testing Cars of the Future " April 2009 made statements regarding electric car technology . When referring to the Tesla motor car , you state : " Tesla -- which has delivered only about 150 cars so far -- has even applied for $350 million in low-cost loans from the Energy Department , prompting critics to ask why taxpayers should help fund a Silicon Valley lab experiment . " Perhaps you should have pointed out that Tesla cars get about 200 miles per charge , more than any other electric vehicle , and yes , it has delivered 150 cars so far . No mention of how that compares to the GM or Toyota models except that the Prius only gets 50 miles per charge . This Silicon Valley start-up is creating a better car because of innovation and ingenuity unburdened with unions and government intervention . Phil Zogran Stuart , Fla . I was surprised not to find mention of the new Ronn Motors Scorpion in your article " Road-Testing Cars of the Future . " This new car will run partially on hydrogen produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car appears to be on the horizon of this new century . John Bancroft Hugo , Okla . Algae and the Atmosphere " Why Making Coal Cleaner Will Take Years " covered the work being done to capture carbon dioxide and store it underground , but no mention was made of algae cultivation as a means of eliminating carbon dioxide from the atmosphere . There are a number of small companies already working on the idea . Water from the sea could be used both for cooling in the power plant and growing algae . The algae could be used to produce ethanol . So an ethanol plant could be built in the same vicinity . A given weight of algae can be used to produce four times as much ethanol as the same weight of corn . The benefits would be cheaper electricity , jobs , and reduced dependency on foreign oil . Problems to solve are design of facilities , transportation and disposal of coal , distribution of electricity , and urban infrastructure . If power plant combustors were designed to liquefy coal for high thermal efficiency , liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent a repeat of events that occurred recently in Tennessee . Transportation of coal from the mines could be handled by augmentation of existing railroads with minor additions . If started in 2009 , I believe , planning , design , and necessary rights of way and government approvals could be completed by 2015 , optimistically , or 2020 at the latest . Irving F. Littman Tustin , Calif . Harvesting Methane Until I read your article " Can Natural Gas Break Our Oil Habit ? " I did n't realize where all the Earth 's natural gases were located and the many problems involved in the switch . It seems like it would cost the United States consumer more to make the switch from oil to natural gas , and our country would still be dependent on foreign supplies . I have heard reports of methane gas being produced by rotting organic matter in our garbage dumps . It would be to our advantage to harness some of this energy since we have an endless supply . Kevin W. Boone Cedar Lake , Ind . The Nuclear Energy Option Nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got a kick out of your comment about nuclear energy in France " Nuclear Power Without Much Fuss " : " The lack of real debate in France about nuclear until recently , critics say , was less a vote of public support than a failure in the French political system . ' France is much less democratic than the United States . ' " So a country held hostage by ecologists is more democratic than a country that generates 80 percent of its electricity with nuclear ? If ecologists had not vetoed nuclear power and offshore drilling for oil and gas , we probably would not be in the economic mess we are today . And it looks like President Obama is in favor of more of the same . George Naniche Moraga , Calif . Reality Checks on Climate I object to Michael Barone 's statement about " legislation that imposes huge costs now on our ailing economy in order to avert a danger that is predicted for many decades hence " in " The Sins of Emission . " This is like ignoring a leak in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An ounce of prevention 20 years ago would have saved the United States this pound of pain today . Linda Fluhrer Pleasant Hill , Calif . Please point out to Michael Barone your article about Bangladesh " Where Climate Change Hurts Most " and " The Plight of Penguins and Polar Bears " in that same issue . His myopic view ignored a look at the future of our country and the world . Earl M. Fritz Columbus , Ohio " Where Climate Change Hurts Most " misses the obvious geological fact that change is mostly what climate does . The current phase of " global warming " ( or good weather , depending on where you live ) has been going on for some 25,000 years , since sea level was more than 256 feet lower than now . Jeffrey M. Reynolds , M.D. Yakima , Wash . Correction : The 2010 ranking of " The Top Business Schools " May 2009 misidentified the 10th school in the Executive M.B.A . program specialty . The correct program is the University of North Carolina -- Chapel Hill ( Kenan-Flagler ) .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
