txt A YOUNG COUPLE SETTLES DOWN My mother once told me that she first " noticed " Father when he came to the Putnam farm near Bedford , Iowa , to return a farm machine his father had borrowed . She was impressed by his skill and gentleness with his team as he maneuvered the wagon to unload the piece . Mother 's family seems to have been well respected in Taylor County , Iowa , farming land her father had bought after being mustered out of the Union Army , disabled in training camp with " consumption , " which was what tuberculosis was called by common folk . Mother had one older sister , Flora , several brothers , and a much younger sister , Stella . By 1901 it is likely that brother Jason , oldest child of Mother 's parents , Henry and Cornelia Putnam , was in charge of the family farm , and that Flora , who had married John Fitch , farmed nearby in Taylor County . My impression is that the Putnam and Fitch establishments were well-equipped and respectable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places where lesser farmers could take their cows or mares to be bred , or where they could borrow a cultivator. // Two questions arise when I attempt to place Morgan and Etta in context in Bedford . Why did they not settle near their parents ? Why did they find themselves twenty-nine and twentyseven years of age at marriage , early in 1901 ? There is no way to get into their skins or their diaries to throw light on these questions , but there are data . In an autobiographical sketch handwritten when she was seventy-nine , Mother writes that she spent a year at Normal School in Stanbury , Missouri , qualifying for a teaching certificate . She once confided to me that she did not , in fact , stay there for a full term . She said that she had been miserable with homesickness , weeping uncontrollably , and that she had come home . The fifteen years between returning from Stanbury , which I estimate to have occurred in 1885 , and her marriage in February , 1901 , were taken up , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in the office of the Taylor County , Iowa , Superintendent of Schools . During this time , she was available as a " supply " teacher , that is , a substitute for teachers temporarily disabled . I remember Mother as a homebody during my boyhood ; she was no gadabout . She preferred to stay at home on Saturday afternoons instead of shopping in town and gossiping . Her groceries were ordered by telephone and picked up by Morgan on his way home . When I was about twelve , neighborhood ladies formed what they called the Ladies Country Club . ( It was renamed Country Ladies Club sometime in the 1920s , when some of the members saw that the earlier name signified a much more free-thinking posture than they intended . ) This club was the only purely social activity Mother had . Morgan would not go 21 L I F E O N T H E D R Y L I N E to church , and she would not go without him , but I do not think she missed the church life a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove Mother home from Normal School in 1885 persisted throughout her life and that what might have been the usual courting and mating years ? in that culture from sixteen to twenty ? passed without enough social activity to encourage beaux . In 1900 , it was now or never ! A lonely occupation and spinsterhood loomed ; it is no wonder that she watched Morgan through the kitchen window . What about Morgan ? Why was he unwed at twentyseven ? Here the answer seems to be that his family was not healthy ? some or all of the four members seemed to be too sick to carry out normal duties much of the time , and Morgan , as the younger son and the lowest in authority , drew the duty of doing the farm work , whether he felt well or not . He did not talk much about his family , but I remember anecdotes in which he walked behind a cultivator , its plow handles holding him up because he was too sick to walk steadily without their support . He once related to me how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , a better man than his older brother Charley . In times past , their father had sent them always to the same field to husk corn , and Morgan could not bring himself to compete . He was content to keep his wagon abreast of that of Charley . On one occasion the boys were sent to separate fields , out of sight of each other , and Morgan , unloading his wagon at the crib , asked his father , " Where 's Charley ? " " Charley ai n't in yet , " his father said , and Morgan suddenly realized , he told me many years later , that he was the better man . What the family needed , Morgan would have to provide . During the weeks , he would fall into bed soon after supper ; family mores , as well as exhaustion , prevented socializ- // ing at Saturday night dances . Charley 's loud and fervent praying turned him away from attending church . There was little chance to socialize or court . Why did Morgan and Etta not settle near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's personal history suggests that he might have been eager to leave the home scene behind and escape the burden of being the least in the family hierarchy , the only member who could not afford to be less than able-bodied , no matter how sick or healthy he felt . Etta would go where her man led , as was the custom in those days . The newly completed railroads and the young towns of the Kansas prairie region advertised for settlers in all the Plains states . Railroads , and land companies as their agents , scoured European countries where immunities from military service , granted to the progeny of invited farm settlers , were running out . The temper of the times encouraged young farmers to move west . What they hoped for was affordable land which , tended according to the practices of Iowa or Europe , would yield abundantly . Like everyone who is not born rich , they hoped their children would be spared the privations and hard labor of their own youth . The possibility that they might someday be rich but unhappy probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become rich . Settlers recruited by land companies were directed to specific communities . Morgan was on his own and so needed to have picked a landing spot . He had seen Concordia and WaKeeney . There they would go . But before we see them in Kansas , there is the matter of religion . // Mother was a member of the Methodist church , but Father missed out on that honor , probably with little regret . As he or Mother told it , he was proposed for membership and his name was posted on a list . There was a probationary period , during which any member might object if he thought the young man unworthy of salvation through Methodism . During the probationary period , Father was scheduled to go to Kansas to thresh wheat ; an appeal that the probation be shortened was denied . He did not renew his application . Father was happy to let all of his children attend Sunday school and even join the church , but he held an aloof , superior attitude toward the clergy , keeping a respectful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been free to attend church , but she would not ask Morgan to harness a horse to the buggy and take her two and a half miles to church . Father 's brittle attitude toward organized religion troubled me during my youth . Emotional , undersized and given to fantasy , I was an early candidate for salvation . Only in my own later years have I seen his position as the beginning of my own agnosticism. // MASON REMEMBERS Mother left an account of Morgan 's and her first days together . It follows , though I 've edited it for clarity from a handwritten manuscript made in 1961 when she was eightynine years old . In February 1901 I married Morgan W. Mason , a farmer and auctioneer in Bedford , Iowa . We came to Republic County , Kansas , in March to a farm located fourteen miles from Concordia , Kansas . Our wedding trip was by train , starting early in the morning . Our first stop was St. Joseph , Missouri , about noon . We were hungry . We ate our wonderful lunch ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken , Iowa fruit , pickles , cake and cookies and sandwiches in the waiting room of the depot . I did not miss hot coffee as did my husband . Those were the days before Thermos bottles . We were Scotch , using the plain way . Water was our drink . We enjoyed our lunch and 25 L I F E O N T H E D R Y L I N E the resting place in the depot at St. Joe ; the next train ride was longer . When we arrived at Wayne , Kansas , in the evening , we were tired . Wayne was a very small place a mile from where we were going to live . We thought to rest until the morning , going up an outside stairway to our room . We slept very well and ate breakfast there . It was a beautiful March morning . We enjoyed our walk of a mile . The first thing we saw was Morgan 's team of fine horses in the barn and our young dog that met us . The house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground floor . It was built of three different materials : cement , stone and wood . This home-furnished room was in a separate room , and Morgan 's parents and brother lived in the other part . The owner of the place was quite old but active ; he boarded with Morgan 's folks . Being a hobbyist , he had gathered much of interest about the place . With his big mule team and strong wagon he would spend much time gathering all kinds of stones large and small , bring them home and make use of them on the place . In a different account , Mother wrote : Our part of the house consisted of a large bedroom and living room in which we placed our furniture that we bought for fifty dollars at a secondhand store in Concordia , Kansas . It conTHE FARM sisted of a cookstove , a table , four chairs , a bed , a washstand and bucket , a washboard and tub , culinary articles and some much needed dishes . We enjoyed the place ; it was much like Iowa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hermit ; I do n't know whether he was a widower or bachelor . I never did ask . He lived happy at home with his large mule team and strong wagon . He made daily trips gathering all kinds of fruit trees which he planted and cared for in a bachelor way , very careful . He brought a large flat white stone , four feet by three feet for my doorstep . I used to enjoy keeping it white and clean . Many trees were bearing fruit at that time . Mother Mason and I canned plums and peaches that year for next year . Over a small stream the landlord made a bridge of stones . It was an artist 's piece of work . This stream was pebbled bottomed . The train came by every morning quite early ; it made it seem like home . I never was homesick for Iowa . We probably would have stayed there , but the owner 's fields were all hedge fenced as were the cow lots and pig pens . Morgan planted corn , wheat and oats . Sixteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent that nothing would grow for that distance ; we decided to get us a home , which we located earlier , loading our cows , horses , furniture , some chickens and turkeys into an emigrant car . Morgan and his father came // to Trego County where Morgan 's father had bought 160 acres of land three and a half miles from WaKeeney , Kansas . We rented a place from George Baker , who lived in town . He was a butcher who furnished meat for railroad men working on the Union Pacific Railroad to Denver , which was completed to Denver in 1870 . While the men took our goods to WaKeeney , Mother Mason , Charley and I stayed with people in Concordia . Our men unloaded everything , put the stock in the corral and the furniture in the house and lit a stove to warm us . We all lived there until Morgan and I completed our sod house on our own place and his folk still lived in the rented house . We moved into the sod house and lived there two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for shingling the roof when one morning , as Morgan and I were going over to our place to work I drove the horses and Morgan held the plow to cut sod , we met a thresher man who wanted an engineer for two months and would pay five dollars a day until he was finished threshing . We hated to leave our roof that long for fear of storms . We talked it over ; money seemed good then so we decided for Morgan to be his engineer . During the time we did n't have any storms . We could finish our soddy . There was lots of straw in the country and Morgan smoothed the floor and packed straw for the floor . He built two-inch lumber around the sides and // ends of twelve feet by thirty feet , the size of the house and staked it solid . Mother Mason had given us an ingrain carpet she had , so we fastened the carpet to the two-inch staked lumber . I do n't know how the packed straw made such a solid floor , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the middle of our house two telephone poles held the slanting roof ; this made a division for two rooms , living room and kitchen , around our stove and eating table . I bought a table oilcloth and sewed it to the carpet . That way we kept the carpet clean by washing the oilcloth when needed . Our roof slanted from west to east , where our windows were ; as the east side was dug below ground with windows above ground we had plenty of light . Our bed was on the west side sloping to east ? that part of the room was lower . We got funny papers and pasted them over our bed . They were lots of fun to read . Our bed was dressed in white with valance to the floor . Morgan made us a wardrobe for our clothes which was curtained with the same material as our doorway between rooms . I brought my sewing machine Singer and my organ with me . When I married I had saved one thousand dollars from teaching etc . My father Putnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cow . We had bought some cows and , with Morgan 's team and wagon and our furniture , loaded them into a car the emigrant car mentioned earlier and came // West . We had a man who witched for wells find us a wonderful well . Roads were in the most convenient places . Then later grass land was being plowed . Several good crops were realized , so others ranchers followed suit and cattle , their main dependence , were being sold . When this happened , cattle sales were good and they brought cash . One February , Morgan had a farm sale every day but on Sundays . He drove a nice black team to sales in two counties , Trego and Gove . We farmed some and kept stock , kept a hired man to take care of things and be with I and the children when he would be late getting home . In 1904 we built a frame house near the well , pumped water with a windmill . Mary was born January 14 , 1905 , in the new house . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought their large hard coal base burner , which , with isinglass gave light and heat for our two rooms and kitchen . Any time in the night I could get up and take care of Mary , without any lamp light , and it was always warm ? a great blessing for us for many years until we could not get hard coal anymore . We used it for all the children ; Howard was just a year old in 1919 , when the top of our big barn was burned . The base burner stored in the barn fell into the basement and broke . The lower part of the barn was of made of cement , so we rebuilt it and it still stands in 1961. // Mother 's manuscript ends a few sentences farther down the page . She tells how , in building the frame house , " Morgan blasted rock from the side of a hill across from where he wanted to build . With this rock and cement he made the foundation for our house ; it had a bedroom with a closet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building that had been used as a granary , connected it to the other part and built porches on the east and west sides that were screened to keep the children in . " By the time when I can remember the house , the screens were no longer needed to contain the small fry , but were useful in excluding flies , which swarmed around the house and barns , were trapped in screen-wire traps , and immobilized on Tanglefoot Fly Paper , which came in castor-oil-glue sheets , stuck together until needed for use . When ripped apart , they sat on tables and other surfaces , sometimes with small saucers of vinegar , sugar or both together , to serve as fly bait . Horse farming apparently made farm premises attractive to flies . They were never so bothersome in town . // I can attest that Mother 's 1961 account of her life dealt in sanitary ambiguities . I heard bitter emotional soliloquies from her during rainy days in her kitchen while I built corncob corrals and entertained my own fantasy as I played on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before marriage had been frittered away ; the milk cow that was supposed to have been bought with the two-hundred-dollar dowry did not materialize ? it was lost somehow , blended in the interminable buyings and sellings that characterized my father 's style of livestock management . Mother 's written autobiography lacked a forthright emotional tone . History had been rendered to fit Victorian propriety . What circumstances in Mother 's account might have justified disappointment , without assigning personal blame to her husband ? First , she had married into a family of four other people in 1901 , and she was not rid of them , day or night , until the summer of 1904 . Today such an arrangement would almost automatically lead to divorce ; not then , and not for my conscience-driven mother . ( This family bitterness endured , as I recall , and was n't confined to Mother . During my childhood , Charley visited us several times . He held fervent prayer sessions // with Mother and exhorted Father to be saved . After a day or two Father would " lend " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled near LaJunta , Colorado , married , and raised two sons , though he was a bachelor until middle age . ) Not visible to the farmers who moved west with the encouragement of land speculators and the railroad , rainfall tapered off dramatically as one moved West . The 1938 Yearbook of the Department of Agriculture gives rainfall data for Bedford , Iowa , averaged back twenty-two years from 1938 , at thirty-two inches . For the forty years before 1938 , the comparable figure for Concordia , Kansas , was twenty-five inches ; for WaKeeney , where most of Mother 's married life was spent , the average was twentyone . It was not necessary to blame the Osage orange hedges for " sapping the moisture for sixteen feet " in order to account for slower growth of crops at Concordia , though the hedges made farming more difficult ; teams had to be turned more shortly ; at ends of fields because of them , and undoubtedly they took their toll of fertility to support seldom-rotated crops . In Trego County , wider fluctuations in rainfall were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had bought land right on the dry line ( the 100th meridian ) . These facts were masked , possibly , by the eloquence of real estate promoters , who had bought the land originally granted to the Union Pacific Railroad near its right-of-way . I have heard different accounts of the extent of this strip ? some say ten miles on each side of the track , some say five . It seems likely that railroad lawyers and land agents exercised judgment and were given power to substitute better , more level land for poor , hilly sections . My father used to delight in an account of one of the 33 L I F E O N T H E D R Y L I N E early real estate agents , doubtless a brother-under-the-skin of the man who sold him a rough quarter section two miles from the center of WaKeeney for about seven dollars an acre . ( His own father , I think , paid a dollar an acre less and got somewhat better land , about two miles farther from the county seat . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buggy and prospective buyer across the prairie , pause by a rain-filled buffalo wallow , take out his tin cup and swig water from the pond . Then he would smack his lips and say , " I have n't seen this spring so low in ten years . " Father was dedicated to progress ? his own and that of the community as a by-product . Father seemed always to have been a Republican Party County Committeeman . He bathed in a washtub near the kitchen range and shaved carefully in preparation for sale-crying trips with his team , and later in a Regal 30 horsepower car , still later in Model T Fords , sold off and replaced yearly when business was good . During World War I , Father was engaged almost every Saturday in an auction of donated items to raise money for the Red Cross or in promoting the current Liberty Bond drive . As a public figure associated with horseflesh , he started the trotting and pacing races at Trego County 's yearly fair , billed there as Colonel Mason ? a title country auctioneers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In spite of this , he never quite qualified as one of the boys among the powers of the community . I do not think malice kept him on the fringe . There is an historical background of which he could not have been more than dimly aware . It may not be fair , but prestige granted is usually more secure than prestige earned . In retrospect I see that earlier settlers ? from soon after the Civil War ? who had English or // Scottish surnames , were WaKeeney 's upper crust . Some of these were doubtless remittance men of old English families ? black sheep ? paid to stay in America and thus out from underfoot . Another circumstance granting prestige was to have homesteaded land before the railroad came through . This gave advantage in experience as well as in family acceptance . Some of the earlier settlers in Trego County had raised families and sent their children to Kansas University at Lawrence before 1904.1 remember that once my mother spoke to Mrs. Charles Hille , the wife of one of WaKeeney 's bankers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young who were returning from the university on the train . Mrs. Hille , who would have been Faith Wonner at the time referred to , said with shy embarrassment that she had doubtless been utterly silly and foolish , whereupon Mother reassured her ? quite unnecessarily . I felt confused when I heard this exchange as a youth ; now I see it as evidence that once prestige is granted , one can afford to be spontaneous . Mother could n't , and Father overdid it . Success as an auctioneer , being a trusted judge of livestock , the fellowship of the Masonic Lodge and the Mystic Shrine , community service in country school box-supper auctions and World War I fund raising were more or less the waste motion of fading youth . // Our bookcase on the farm south of WaKeeney held three or four heavy books that no one ever read . ( The Bible was not neglected . Mother read this often and I remember reading most of it during my adolescence . ) One of the neglected volumes was Morals and Dogma which seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as did most WaKeeney businessmen . Second on the unread list was Bigelow on Torts , bound to emphasize that it was a law book . I tried it and found it dull . Mother confided to me that Father had once started home study in law but gave it up . This prepared me for what I was to learn later when advising veterans of World War II . Few students ever go beyond the introductory assignments of correspondence courses . Their reasons were probably the same as Father 's . His first years of marriage were taken up with breaking sod and herding his own and other people 's cattle on the buffalo grass that paved the landscape of Western Kansas . Children arrived in 1905 , 1906 and 1908 . In 1918 brother Howard was born . By that time Father 's dream of being an educated man must have faded , though he continued to hope for conspicuous success as a businessman until the dust storm and Depression years of the 1930s. // The bookcase held two books that bore marks of use . These were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mother once explained that Father could not go to school to learn a profession , and that he saw that our county and adjoining ones did not have an auctioneer . Furthermore , one could become an auctioneer by showing that he could do the work . Father had stationery printed which showed a postagestamp portrait in the upper left corner , advertised in the Western Kansas World and was in business . He charged two percent of sale receipts , and , in his most profitable period , just after World War I , this translated into seventy-five to one-hundred-fifty dollars for a day 's work . Many sales were of the effects of farmers who had given up Trego County , and who had to clear obligations before moving on . Father was a good judge of livestock and worked hard for the highest price he could get . When an animal or a piece of machinery lacked for bidders , Father often bought it . The auctioneer did not bid openly , of course . There were always trusted friends present , and they were never surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were usually the sale clerks . Through them good citizens could arrange credit , even at cash sales , and having their man on the scene protected the bankers against slippage ; furthermore , they took out one percent for the clerk 's labor . Father was encouraged in his auction career by local bankers . Other people finally advertised to cry sales for one-and-one-half percent , but an extra half-percent was a good Investment if it improved prices , and the customers thought tat her 's work worth the difference . The farmer , of course , wanted all he could get , even if it was not enough to clear his debts . // Not all farm sales were forced . Old farmers retired and moved to town or to Florida , estates had to be settled and prosperous farmers had to sell off surplus livestock and outdated machinery . An auction was a social event , and the seller was a big man , even if only for a day . Father had two gunnysacks filled with tin cups . These were lent gratis to church groups or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lunches were free , provided by the seller and catered by church groups or by the one black , Hays Porter , who was tolerated in our free-state town . I must say for Father that he and Porter were friends on as near an equal basis as they could manage . Porter was not invited to our house for dinner , but Father was never invited to bring his family to the bankers ' houses , either . He aspired to the easy ways of assured position , but he never mastered them . Soon after World War I the statement " lunch stand on grounds " replaced " free lunch " on sale bills . Whatever else it did , it freed Porter to serve the sort of food he liked to prepare and which sale patrons doubtless preferred to what a bankrupt farmer could afford . I believe that Porter plastered the house in which I grew up , and that he was in charge of building the cyclone cellar . I 'm confident that he was regarded as the concrete building expert of the community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being plastered , eating meals with the family and sleeping must have tested his and his employers ' ideas of propriety . Father , at least , was spared considerable need to be thoughtful by the belief that blacks were biologically inferior . I remember him saying , one time , that their skulls lacked the longitudinal seam which he attested whites had ? that their skulls were truly // like a species of lump coal we used to buy and which was called niggerhead because many of the lumps seemed to have been formed by whorls of vegetable matter and resembled cannon shot in size . Relations between whites and blacks could be pleasant , but they required toleration on the part of the blacks and condescension by many of the whites . Sale business was seasonal , peaking before the first of March when farm leases traditionally ran out and loans fell due . Sometimes the farmer could hold on until July , when he harvested a last crop of wheat . Everything was complicated by rental arrangements . All farmers planted more land than they owned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the landowner if seed wheat had been furnished by the farmer and one-half if the landowner had provided seed . Many of the landowners were absentee individuals , and some land was owned by insurance companies or other corporations . In the years following World War I , Father was likely to have a sale on almost every weekday in February and many in March and April besides . Often , he drove twenty miles or more to the sale . Early , a buggy and team were used , with a Galloway steer lap robe for protection . Later , a Model T Ford served unless roads were exceptionally muddy . Tire chains were employed often during wet seasons . When times were good , Father bought a new Ford every year , often selling the old one at a sale . Farmers were happy to permit this . A car on the sale bill helped to draw a crowd . Trading in cars became the custom somewhat later . By the mid-1930s , with dust storms and the Depression , trading in was the order of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But by this time , Father had become a town-based 39 L I F E O N T H E D R Y L I N E automobile dealer and had begun to phase out the auction business . Throughout World War I , Father was a highly visible public figure . He was too old for the army , and with three small children , was not likely to be drafted in any event . He was active as a gratis auctioneer for almost weekly Red Cross auctions . In these , citizens would donate items such as knit scarves , kitchen utensils or poultry , which would be sold ; proceeds would go to the Red Cross . Often , the buyer , who ostentatiously paid an exorbitant price , would re-donate the item , and it would be sold again , and again it would bring an outrageous amount . In this way our farmers , in town for Saturday afternoon , would demonstrate solidarity with the war effort . Such demonstrations of patriotism were especially important for members of the German-Russian community ? or , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WaKeeney , most of these Volga Germans were German Lutherans , though in Ellis County to the east , most were Roman Catholics , and in places farther south and east , Mennonites . They were good farmers , and they were prospering , and it was important that they contribute liberally to all warrelated causes . Many of them spoke little English , and often were driven to extravagant gestures in their efforts to make the locals understand . Everybody understood very well that one could be ostracized and even have his farm buildings painted yellow if there was any hint that he was pro-German . Though no one spoke about it , credit at the bank and the grocery store were doubtless also conditioned by perceived patriotism during World War I. In the boom times of the early 1920s , Father was joined in the auction ring by O. H. Olson of Collyer . This arrangement // gave the farmer a more aggressive selling team and prolonged Father 's career as an auctioneer . Even so , Father recognized a need for a less demanding occupation and was ripe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began in 1925. // WORKSTOCK In 1916 , with America about to become involved in war , horses of all types were in demand . A sound animal four or five years of age and unbroken could be bought for about a hundred dollars . Green broke , the animal would be worth two or three times as much . Father was active in this trade and often had twenty or more extra horses on hand , either green broke and awaiting sale or ready to be harnessed for the first time . John Naiman , a neighbor 's son , helped as hired man . One " experienced " animal and one neophyte would be carefully hitched to the farm wagon . Father would stand in the wagon , holding the reins while John held a long rope attached to the halter of the green horse . When the team cleared the barnyard , Naiman passed the rope to Father and scrambled up the endgate . They would then proceed around a square mile and perhaps to town , where they could negotiate the wagon dump in the Hardman elevator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be repeated with a different pair if farm work permitted . A day later , the neophyte of yesterday would be the experienced horse and the daily routine started again . Mother probably // worried . I stayed at a safe distance . When a wagon team turns sharply , the inside front wheel screeches against a rub iron on the wagon box , and the box rides up dangerously . I was not one to take chances . The number of lessons a horse got varied with his probable worth and his resistance to breaking , but I think the average would be about three hitchings . Horses that showed five or six years age by mouth and which resisted handling were unfit for service . They were more likely to be sold for soap grease and hide than to be returned to pasture . Mules were in greater demand and were more profitable than horses . At first , Father would have nothing to do with them , but Naiman was a good mule handler and he and Father eventually broke many teams of mules . Thereafter we used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less greedy at the feed box than horses . Most of them walked faster than our horses and t hey were less likely to bite or kick unexpectedly . This might have been because they were handled more gently ; handler and handled seemed equally eager to keep the peace . C H I L D H O O D Grandpa Mason died beneath an ash tree near his potato patch on our South Farm ? one Grandpa had once owned before moving on to Dodge City and a truck gardening venture , then coming back to live with Father and Mother . Father had bought the South Farm in 1916 . My sisters and I , riding our horses , found grandpa when he had died . We had come over from the home farm for a visit . This was the first corpse I had ever seen . Months after the funeral , I remember that Father shared the first of a very few family confidences with me . " Harry , " he said , " today I paid the last of Pap 's funeral expenses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I preferred to work with Father , though most of the farm work was done by hired men whose pre-Chaucer stories made me laugh , yet feel sinfully guilty . The one type of work that Father and I did together and I did not enjoy was grooming livestock . Father liked to do this on Sundays , and he enjoyed it . I stood holding a halter rope , feeling guilty for working on the Sabbath and trying to be patient . The hope to move up in the world was clothed , for Mother and Father alike , in making their children 's lives easier than theirs had been . Mother did dishes alone after meals . The // girls , she said , would have plenty of that to do when they grew up . Father believed in chores . My sister Edith was not assigned outdoor work . My sister Mary was Father 's strong helper and boss and driver when we went , behind a slow but patient horse , to school in a buggy . Doing chores with Mary was somehow very grim for both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never hard . What was wrong was that we were on our own and responsible . We had to make such judgments as : Have we " stripped " the cow 's udder sufficiently ? Did a few flakes of chaff and possibly manure from the cow 's underbelly foul the milk too much ? Without a responsible adult presence , work standards tend to decline , guilt to accumulate and revulsion to set in . Early in childhood , I showed interest in machines and how they work . Father recognized this and nourished the interest in many ways . I remember one period in the summer , probably in 1916 or 1917 , when I would have been eight or nine years old , when Father and I sat , almost every evening , on the concrete wings at the end of our cyclone cellar while daylight lingered , then faded . He told me how a steam engine cylinder turned the expansion of steam into powered rotation of a belt pulley . He described the double-acting piston , the slide valve , the eccentric mechanism , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam dome , the flyball governor , the firebox and flues and the Penberthy injector which magically forced water into the boiler against its 150-pound pressure . I remember listening with rapt attention , asking questions and sweating through the problem of getting the engine caught on dead center , working the reverse gear ? which changed the timing of the slide valve ? and in fantasy , sounding the whistle . Father illustrated with pencil // drawings , most of them made on pieces of scrap lumber . I would gladly have provided a Big Chief Pencil Tablet if it had been needed . Father even joined me in fantasies of engine operation . He dramatized regulating the throttle , firing the boiler until the safety valve popped , listening for possible irregularities in the exhaust and checking dampers and forced draft . I could tell that he understood steam engines well , and from other conversations that he understood operation of the threshing cylinder , the shaking sieves , fans , return elevators and wind stacker of the thresher . It must have been in 1919 or 1920 that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday afternoons in town . He would auction miscellaneous items that people had brought to a vacant lot between two stores on Main Street , then spend time in conversation with farmers who had come to town to shop and visit . Probably unconsciously , he was keeping his businessman image shiny . He made it a practice to give me a quarter to spend as I wished when we arrived at our parking place . I think he expected me to find my friends Walter Kline or Harold Burnett and scrabble around in the downtown area . Kline 's father owned nearly a solid block of business buildings , including a grocery store , a furniture and embalming emporium , a men 's furnishing store , a drugstore and a bakery . On a few occasions I remember that we did roam the back rooms of the stores , but I detected a putting-off in the attitudes of the merchants , and this discouraged me . Merchants did not want to antagonize the son of their landlord , but they probably did not want two or three immature boys barging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least a year older than me and aeons more sexually advanced and aggressive . I felt inferior and a bit sinful , // listening to his accounts of exploits with girls , even with women mature enough to be thought of as mother or auntie . I gradually tapered off association with these playmates , and developed a routine of my own . I might spend five or ten cents of my quarter for an ice-cream cone , or I might save the whole quarter to apply to the purchase of a baseball or a fielder 's glove . Instead of looking up Kline or Burnett , I would walk up to Main Street , across a vacant lot and an alley , to the back entrance to Iry Woerner 's welding shop . The back of the shop was mostly doorway ? a space wide enough to drive tractors or trucks through or to accommodate the damaged projections of machines so that a torch could reach t hem . As one , two or perhaps three summers passed , the work of the welding shop changed . Repair jobs became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the projects were tanks for hauling gasoline or other petroleum products on highways . The oxyacetylene torches were supplemented with WaKeeney 's first electric arc welder . Without taking in its significance , I was seeing the emergence of an early surge in the petrochemical culture and the flowering of one of WaKeeney 's few successful manufacturing efforts . Woerner continued to make tanks in WaKeeney until the beginning of World War II ; then , I think , he moved to Wichita . In 1915 or 1916 , my two older sisters and I had started driving a buggy to school in WaKeeney . The first horse we drove was named Jeff , a freshly retired mover of Standard Oil Company of Indiana 's local tank wagon . It is useless to speculate whether Jeff fell from tank wagon horse to school buggy horse because of old age ? he was well past twenty ? or because increased demand 47 L I F E O N T H E D R Y L I N E for gasoline forced his former owner , Charley Sellers , to substitute a team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1923 we three Mason children had gone through Jeff and two more buggy horses , my sisters had graduated from high school and Sellers had put real horse power out of business hauling gasoline and kerosene . He had mounted Standard 's tank on a Reo Speed Wagon . I remember seeing the truck on its side on the road just south of WaKeeney 's cemetery one morning when the road was a bit muddy . Apparently autos , mostly Ford Model Ts , had created meandering ruts , and when the Speed Wagon followed these , a partial load of fuel had sloshed from side to side violently enough to lift the truck neatly onto its side , crosswise of the road . I hasten to emphasize that the tank was a company item ? not one made by Woerner . Woerner 's tanks contained baffles to decrease sloshing , and , I suspect , drivers had learned to drive slowly and carefully with partly loaded tanks of liquid . I did not invade the social space of the welding shop , but took up station on a stone or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned later , was a kind and sensitive man , and he might have had a hand in providing me something that was not a real seat , but usable as one . He and his men must have been amused to see a youngster come , Saturday after Saturday , to the back of the shop , sit on his block of stone or cement and stay there for hours with scarcely any perceptible movement . I did not speak or call attention to myself . Soon Father knew where to find me when it was time to go home to do chores . If he exchanged a wink with Woerner 's men , I was never conscious of it . In 1925 when Father went into the garage business , and for a few years after , Sellers was still delivering gasoline for THE FARM Standard Oil ; he was our tank wagon man . He had , of course , a truck larger than the original Speed Wagon , and he used a large hose to fill our underground tanks . If the price of gasoline were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made sure we were filled up at a lower price . Within a few weeks of the time when he would have had a vested pension from the company upon retiring , he was fired , and a new man took over . By that time Sellers had sustained an injury that left him with a severe limp . Everyone who knew about Seller 's treatment by Standard Oil was incensed , but none of us protested vigorously or formally . I like to think that things would be different today ? that a certificate of protest would be circulated , that , at least , we would have changed brands of gasoline . But , I do n't know . // Somewhere there is a yellowed photograph showing Father 's Old Billy , with me , on my third birthday , looking scared on Father 's saddle . Morgan must have stepped back out of camera range just long enough to see me achieving a milestone in horsemanship ? being in the saddle alone rather than clinging to an older person from behind the cantle or squirming uncomfortably in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be an earlier fragment of memory , in which I had fallen to the ground just as horses erupted from the barn door . Old Billy or one of the other horses walked over me , carefully placing its feet so that I escaped injury . Another early memory involves horseflesh . In the autumn of 1911 , Father had moved our family into WaKeeney so that Mary could start first grade . Edith , a year and a half younger , cried at being left behind and was allowed to accompany her ; the two of them then went on through grade school and high school together . The winter proved to be one long remembered for its blizzards and snow , and Father 's judgment was vindicated . As the house-high snowdrifts receded in the spring , Father began preparations to move back to the farm . // One morning I heard my sisters shouting ; there was a colt in the barn behind our rented house , and they rushed out to see it . Hopelessly behind as usual , I churned out of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barn . I fell on a broken bottle and cut a gash in my right leg just below the knee . I remember Doctor Jones , with his chewed-up cigar , cleaning the wound and sewing it with three stitches . The number of stitches was a measure of the seriousness of any accident . When I whined at the pain , he asked , " Does it hurt ? I ca n't feel it ! " So much for clinical humor and the status of children in WaKeeney in 1912 . I also remember that when I finally did see the colt , it was at least a yearling . It looked like a slightly undersized horse ? the endearing spindly legs had been overtaken by a developing body . Looking back from my eighty-fourth year , I see this as one of a long sequence of indifferent encounters with horseflesh . Why could my father give up horses reluctantly , Wendell Berry hold to them after nearly all farms were mechanized , and I , from the first , be driven to associate with them only to please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between horses and men can be roughly appreciated ( understood is too strong a word ) by thinking servant-master , adversary-friend . The horse 's role in the economy is to serve man ; the atmosphere that master and horse inhabit can range from grudging respect to warm affection . Berry seems to love his team and they to serve him gladly . Father was the Republican Committeeman , happy with his horses yet anxious that they keep their place . As a child , I could read Father 's attitude , but I was both too immature in person and too small physically to build a real master-servant relationship with a horse . I came to horses too young and too 51 L I F E O N T H E D R Y L I N E small . In summer , I could have had shoes , but I preferred to be barefoot . One of my more painful memories of Dandy , the painted pony , was of his left-front hoof sliding off my bare foot . Flies were abundant around the barnyard , and horses had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamp to dislodge them from thin-skinned front legs . Bare human feet suffered . Another source of trouble for a young rider was mounting up . Our saddle stock was broke to stand while the rider swung up from the left stirrup but to move off before the rider was fully seated . This kept a short rider anxious . One method we used when away from the barnyard was to find a cutbank ? a short cliff of about fourteen or fifteen inches , where the flat plateau of the prairie had slumped from erosion . Prairie land is not as level as it seems to be from an Amtrak car or from an automobile on the interstate highways that parallel the tracks . The railroad was laid out to avoid hills and valleys ; highways encroached on the rightof-way , often after lawsuits had been settled . So , in the pasture ? the less plowable land of my father 's home quarter section ? one could find a cutbank , guide the horse to expose his left or " near " side below the grassy crest and mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much pain and conflict for both horse and rider might have been saved if someone had convinced farmers sometime before 1910 that a rider must be able to mount easily from level ground before being trusted atop a horse . By the time I was six years old , Father had given up moving to town for the school year , but he had not given up having his children educated in the WaKeeney school ; it was presumed to be superior to the slightly closer one-room Chalk // District schoolhouse . At first , Father must have driven my sisters to school , either in his 30 Horsepower Regal or in a buggy . When I entered first grade , Mary was entrusted with a horse and buggy to make the daily trip . The pattern was to leave the farmyard in plenty of time , loaded with syrup-pail lunches and covered with a warm lap robe in cold weather , and drive to a livery barn near downtown WaKeeney , about a half mile from the school . There , liverymen unhitched our horse and put him in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in later years skated with roller skates on the sidewalks , to the schoolhouse . At first , Old Billy was considered too fractious for us , and Father bought Old Jeff , the retiree from pulling the Standard Oil Company tank wagon . Jeff was somewhere in the far end of his twenties , which is old for a horse , and he was devoted to taking his time . Mary slapped the horse 's rump with the lines and beat him with the short buggy whip , but nothing would inspire him to go fast enough to please us . Forcing the pace was the spirit of Manifest Destiny , and though we had never heard the term , we were of a temperament and a degree of immaturity to find moseying a sin . Within a few years , Father placed Jeff in his second and final retirement and gave us his beloved red bay Billy , the one that had carried him many miles in the saddle . There was a distinct class difference between saddle horses and draft stock , but a saddle horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a single buggy horse , without losing prestige . Mary 's driving record and growing maturity made her a suitable driver for the still fractious Billy . He must have been in his late teens . A Russian t h istle blowing across the road would elicit a brisk sideways " shy " 53 L I F E O N T H E D R Y L I N E but did not endanger the buggy if the driver was alert . Mary always was . There were two memorable emergencies during Billy 's tenure as school horse . The first one occurred during cold weather , when a lap robe was tucked in around feet to keep them warm . In addition , Father heated bricks , which were placed in the bottom of the buggy frame . These were taken out by the livery men and kept on the top of their office stove and replaced for the trip home . I remember that I had been left at home , probably with a cold . Looking out across the prairie shortcut Mary often took on the homeward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buggy , Billy straining at the bits , and my sisters frantically pitching out burning blankets . Had there not been snow on the ground , the dry winter grass would doubtless have burned . Father was furious at the liverymen but , as I remember it , he wisely decided that it was better for the children 's feet to be chilled than to attempt to educate the liverymen as to the proper temperature for foot warmers . As a bit of history , it is appropriate to say that there was a still more dangerous way to keep one 's feet warm in a buggy or in an early automobile . This was the charcoal footwarmer , a sloping-sided metal device that contained , in one end , a controllable vent for draft and , in its interior , a drawer in which two brick-sized chunks of charcoal could be housed . These heaters had such a firm reputation for danger that Father was not tempted to offer one for our use . During one long cold winter we rode horseback to school , employing , in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dandy and a mule named Alice . Alice had by far the easiest gait . She would walk fast // cheerfully , but she refused to trot or gallop . The greatest problem with horseback travel during that winter was snowballs , which caught in the hooves of the horses , built up to a height of an inch and a half and had to be removed with a stick ( or a schoolbag ruler ) to prevent stumbles . On a few occasions I rode behind Mary 's saddle , and I can remember having my fingers cramped shut cold , even through mittens , to the extent that my teacher rubbed them to ease them up . The nearest we came to frostbite , however , was when , several times , the middle of a rider 's cheek would accumulate a hard spot about the size of a cherry . It usually disappeared in a day or two , but the cheek might be tender for several weeks . Old Billy 's last school caper occurred on the way home on a spring afternoon . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and found a package from Sears or Montgomery Ward , containing a photographic developing outfit , complete with a red chimney for a kerosene lamp to be used in a darkroom not equipped with electricity . We turned left from the mailbox , eagerly unwrapping and inspecting the equipment , and Billy was allowed to trot , as was custom , down Sellers ' hill , a short dip in a draw that drained land to the north . Billy saw a tumbling Russian thistle and , probably feeling it his duty , shied to the right . This would not be much of a problem usually nor expose the buggy to danger . But this maneuver was different . The usually docile Billy went into a bucking frenzy , tore up the harness , broke the shafts and turned the buggy on its side . Two of us went out over the left side ; Mary went out and under on the right . None of us was hurt , but it took some time to gather up the contents of the package . We were not to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home ? a walk of a half mile . Then we could see a spot on Billy 's right hind quarter , about the size and shape of a football , where the winter hair had not been shed . Under this spot was an angry blister . When the blister was thrown against the buggy shaft , the pain had been so intense and unexpected that dependable old Billy shed his sanity . The blister 's explanation was simple . Our few laying hens ran freely through the stalls of the horse barn , and they had become infected with roup , a throat disease . The remedy for roup was to lace the hens ' drinking water with copper sulfate . Their drinking trough had been in the back of Billy 's stall . A splash from it had permeated the straw-and-manure bedding of the stall , and the blister had been the result . Regular grooming would have disclosed the blister , but Father 's days of devotion to horses had passed , and we children thought of the school horse only as a means of transportation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a fix . Old Billy figured in one other well-remembered incident . Up until the Armistice Day parade in 1919 , Father led WaKeeney 's parades astride Old Billy . On the occasion of Armistice Day , 1919 , members of the American Legion had decreed that the parade must be led by a retired officer of the American Expeditionary Force ; a local insurance agent , Max Coldiron , drew the job . Coldiron was not at home in the saddle , and there was some tittering when he teetered from side to side on the aging but still fractious blood-bay . He verged on the disgrace of " pulling leather , " a term we applied to tenderfeet who were obliged to grab frantically for the saddle horn , pommel or any straps that came handy , in order to stay astride the horse . // There is another story about Doctor Jones , the man who sewed my cut knee . He also had a farm about two miles south of WaKeeney , with Big Creek running diagonally through it from northwest to southeast . It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrigation project . The idea was to pump water from Big Creek up to an earthen reservoir , then pipe it down to ditches gouged among rows of crops and vegetables . To Initiate the project , he seined huge carp from the creek , cooked them and invited everyone in the area for a fish fry . There was a large crowd , the weather was fine , and everyone seemed to have a good time . When it came time to demonstrate the irrigation machinery , I remember that my father was given the honor of cranking up the Heider tractor that was belted to the centrifugal pump . Properly suited and hatted , he brought the crank up smartly , and the tractor burst into song . The pump , however , did not prime , and only a small trickle of water came out . This ended the demonstration almost before it began . Within a few days , the pump was made to work , and pumping to fill the earth-lined reservoir began . It soon became clear that the pond was not going to fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even where there is a saddle of loam and clay soil under the native 1rass , there may be sand or rock a few feet farther down . Sand seemed to be the undoing of the Jones reservoir . Doctor Jones did n't give up easily . He was pasturing a herd of fine steers for a man named Bob Kirk ? a devoted stockman who had worked his way I mm Scotland to America with a shipload of select Shorthorns . Now , years later , his way with cattle had made him affluent . Imagine the commotion when Kirk found out that his own stock was being used to tramp down the mud in the Jones reservoir . L I F E O N T H E D R Y L I N E The round and round circuit of the steers was stopped , of course , but not before proving that the natural bottom of the pond was too porous to hold water . Jones later devised some way to irrigate a few acres , though not large fields . Across the section line road to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had somewhat better fields for irrigation . He succeeded in raising forage crops with irrigation , and those fields were still being irrigated in 1987. 58 F I E L D W O R K Farmers who were oriented toward the town life , that is , who felt more fulfilled in a suit than in overalls , were more likely than others to concentrate on winter wheat as a crop , relegating egg gathering , milking and other barnyard enterprises to women . Some farm women became full field partners of their husbands ; they were the ones who had plenty of athletic energy and who felt little threat in being regarded as " coarse , " rather than " refined . " They probably reasoned that , to be refined , it was enough to shop in town on Saturday afternoons and perhaps attend a dance on Saturday nights . Like their husbands and children , they were captives of the American Dream . That dream , in WaKeeney , was to be realized by planting and harvesting progressively larger acreages of hard red winter wheat . Field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harvest . The ground was plowed with a share-and-moldboard plow , usually a gang of two fourteen-inch moldboards supported by a three-wheeled frame with a seat for the driver . Typically , the plow was driven along the edge of the field , counterclockwise , throwing the dirt outward toward the fence , if indeed there was a fence . Once around a portion of the field containing about twelve to fifteen acres , the team was directed so // that one horse walked in the furrow , the flat-bottomed ditch that had been exposed by the plow ; the plow 's arrangement of beams and doubletrees was adjusted to place the plow on unplowed land , neatly joining the inside of the furrow last plowed . Plowing the land then consisted of walking and pulling for the horses , and for the farmer , supervising the depth of penetration of the plow , urging the laggard horses by word ( they knew their names ) or by slaps of the lines , and seeing that the plow scoured . Scouring meant that the dirt slid smoothly off the moldboard in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dropping in a rough heap without being properly turned over . Soil that had the proper moisture content scoured easily . Soil that was too wet gave trouble . A plow that had been allowed to rust would not scour dependably until the rust had been worn off . A plow could be protected from rust by a thick coating of axle grease , left on the plow over the winter . This could be washed off before starting to plow , but a few hours ' plowing might yet be needed before scouring was assured . Bunches of weeds could clog up the space between moldboards and the beams that pointed them toward their work . Lines of rank grass that had evaded sod breaking along the edges of buffalo wallows could sometimes clog the plow , and they always put a sudden heavy load on the shoulders of the horses . Failing to wash caked sweat from horses ' shoulders , or fitting collars poorly , could disable horses . We usually had six horses , working abreast , pulling a gang plow ; shoulders were inspected and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse had its own collar . When we lent horses at harvest time to our neighbor , Sam Campbell , each one was accompanied by its own collar , and // Campbell always inquired about each horse 's name . Sometimes this was embarrassing , as when a particularly rigid-dispositioned animal was named " Sam , " or a mare mule was named " Alice V " for a local piano teacher . It was unthinkable to keep only six animals in the barn or corral in order to field a six-horse team . There had to be two or more spares to substitute for animals that needed rest . About once in ten days , a working bunch of horses was rotated to a pasture about two miles from the home farm , and a fresh cohort was brought in . All one had to do to get the bunch to pasture was to mount a saddle horse and open the gate in the corner of the sparse home pasture . The horses knew the way . One then had to outrun them and open the lush pasture 's gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was usually not hard to do . A few days at pasture seemed to leave the horses and mules bored , and they went back to work quite willingly . This could be said of the field teams , not of the saddle horses . When one of the saddle stock had been put to pasture ? a much less frequent event ? a half-day of hard riding by two horsemen might be necessary to round him up . Eventually the truant would give up and allow himself or herself to be caught , saddled and bridled with leather taken from one of the chase horses and ridden home . The unsaddled chase horse would then have a turn at pasture . The practice of laying out a patch to be plowed by plowing around it counterclockwise until the unplowed portion narrowed and shortened as the work progressed had two troublesome consequences . The soil near the field fence was thrown outward , year after year , until a considerable ridge appeared there , and a corresponding low place was created in the middle 61 L I F E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N E of the field . A better plan was to alternate anticlockwise plowing from the outside with clockwise plowing , starting with furrows made along a stretched string set up to define the center line of the field rectangle . In this way , dirt thrown outward one year could be thrown inward the next . One had to do some rough surveying to set up the line , however , and Kansas wheat farmers seemed to feel that they would be retired before the consequences of single-direction plowing caught up with them . With luck , this might be true . There was , however , another immediate disadvantage to the outward-in progress of plowing . Both the horses and their driver could see the job they were doing becoming smaller as the days wore on . The psychologists who wrote my early introductory texts and who denigrated animal intelligence should have spent more time on a farm . The horses not only saw the job nearing completion , they began to walk more and more briskly as they saw the area they were to plow diminish . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm work with a team . It must have been July or August of 1924 . Father had put a hired man with a six-horse team and a gang ( two moldboard ) plow and me with a three-horse team and sulky ( one moldboard ) plow to work preparing the South Farm field for winter wheat . He had inspected the field and decided that we would probably finish the field by mid-afternoon . He had been a little nervous about the job and , before going to cry a farm auction , had given strict instructions to the hired man . He was to stop plowing first , so that my team could finish its land while his team was still hitched to his plow , then finish his last few rounds after mine had been unhitched . He was not to make any substitutions in my // team ( three slow old mares ) to make it possible to get the two teams to finish at the same time . Father was well aware of the urge a team felt to speed up the pace when it saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feasible to have one plow follow the other on a single land , because my team walked more slowly and because my plow was two inches wider than one moldboard of the gang plow . To plow the same land with them would result in unsightly ridges , which would jolt harvesting machinery . At noon , seeing that my team was getting behind on the job , the hired man committed his first sin . He substituted the mare mule Alice V for my furrow horse . When his team was about to finish his land , he followed through with his second gaffe . He allowed his team to finish , unhitched it from the plow , secured the plow to trail behind the service wagon , hitched the team to the wagon and started for the home farm while I still had about two short rounds to finish . I remember vividly that my team began to trot on the outward trip of the last round and to gallop as they turned to produce the last furrow . Controlling them was impossible . I tried to retard them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this only raised the wheels of the sulky crazily above the ground , and I soon abandoned the effort . My runaways had about two hundred yards to go to catch up with the hired man 's outfit . Up over the trailing gang plow they came , coming to a stop with the long lever of the gang plow a few inches from my right ear and a bay mare 's right foot nearly cut off by one of the shares of the gang plow . Alice V , the mare mule that had triggered the runaway , was not injured . Within minutes , Father arrived . He had finished his auction and , apprehensive , had driven out to meet us . Fortunately // he was in his Model T Ford . We had no need for more nervous livestock . I remember that Father did not fly into a rage . He did not scold me , and I do not think he said much to the hired man . He did not fire him , I know . I think Father had a settled policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting out of control . There was , of course , more to field work than plowing , and plowing itself was seldom dramatic or difficult . Usually the stubble turned over smoothly , the team took the job in stride , and the plowman was free to listen to the meadowlarks , even to daydream . When plowing was done , there was a wait for the flyfree date for our county before seeding winter wheat . This was a date established by agricultural experts to allow time for a stage in the life cycle of the Hessian fly , a wheat pest , to occur under unfavorable conditions and thus give the new wheat a better chance to thrive . Usually , planting was delayed until after school had started in the autumn , so wheat was sown by Father or hired men . Sorghum crops were cut with a corn binder and shocked , and I sometimes helped with putting shocked feed into the mow of the barn or into stacks where cattle could , at first , reach through fences to nibble , and later have bundle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stacks . When bundles or other hay were to be put in the barn 's mow , I , as the " kid , " always drew the job of keeping the stuff back from the mow door . This was frustrating , because the two men on a wagon could always throw the stuff up faster than I could move it back , and I felt unworthy and choked with dust to boot . Sometimes Father sowed winter rye between rows of corn or forage sorghum . I drew this job only once . We used a narrow grain drill , which would fit // between rows of the row crop . It was pulled by a single horse or mule . The driver had to keep seed in the hopper of the drill and maintain a pattern of turning into unsowed rows . I was too much given to fantasy to do this properly . The pattern of sowing required that the drill turn past at least one unsowed row , in order to give a smooth turn at row ends . It was possible to skip a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same row twice . That I made both errors showed up when the rye sprouted , about the time school started . WHEAT HARVEST FURTHER NOTES Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn . ? Deuteronomy XXV ; 4 When crops were grown to be consumed on the farm , there was little penalty for having them ripen unevenly over a period of several weeks . The farmer and his family could take their own time about getting the crop in . As farms became more like factories , harvesting , particularly of wheat , was compressed into shorter times , and the anxiety associated with it was compressed into taller and sharper peaks , until , for the wheat farmer in 1890 or 1920 , harvest on a farm of five hundred to one thousand acres was accomplished in two periods : cutting and maturing in shocks or stacks followed , after a break of one or two weeks , by threshing . Violent weather ? rain , wind or a combination of both ? could wipe out a crop , and as farming on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wheat crop could be disastrous . In our rapidly industrializing society at the turn of // the century , machinery to manage the farmer 's risk was invented and marketed , some of the uncertainty of the farm field was overcome through use of the machines , and the focus of farmers ' anxiety moved to encounters with their bankers , who provided the credit to buy machines and seed and , by their judgments concerning renewal of notes , determined who " made good " or " went broke " on the land . To understand the changing fortunes of Morgan and Etta Mason , it should be helpful to know in some detail how the separate processes of putting away a crop of wheat have changed during the period of their active work lives ? from 1895 through 1920 . Binding , Shocking , Threshing Cyrus McCormick 's 1867 invention , the grain binder , was used on the smaller farms throughout Kansas to cut wheat during the period when sod was broken and open range converted into farms . The machine was pulled through the field by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its mechanism was powered by a cleated wheel drawn forward with the machine , connected by roller chain to the mechanism of the binder . This mechanism consisted of a sickle , a reel to tip the headbearing straw back onto a platform and canvas conveyors on the platform and on a short elevator section to carry the cut wheat to the binder head . The binder head itself accumulated bundles of wheat of about eight inches in diameter and tied them with twine . Bundles were accumulated on a bundle carrier , which the driver released to form windrows perpendicular to the sides of the // field . The machine typically cut a swath seven feet wide , and , in dry weather , about eight acres could be cut in a day . The farmer , his wife , the teenage children and perhaps a hired man could tip these bundle rows up into shocks , cover each shock with a broken bundle to shed dew or rain and have the crop reasonably secure against bad weather for the two weeks ' wait for a threshing machine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cut when not quite fully ripe , would mature and dry . Thus threshing might be the only part of the wheat-growing cycle that required transient labor ? usually for three to five days . Heading , Stacking , Threshing Large farms usually employed the header instead of the binder , and , instead of hiring just one man during cutting , employed crews of eight or ten men throughout cutting . Taking greater risks , these larger farmers allowed the wheat to ripen before cutting , leaving it standing several days more than did those who bound the grain . Then a header , rather than a binder , cut the wheat . Up through the canvas conveyor on their platforms , these machines resembled binders except that they cut twelve feet , rather than seven , at a swath . The conveyors were longer , however , and they fed the cut heads , with shorter straw , into horse-drawn wagons called header barges , which were pulled by two-horse teams and kept abreast of the conveyer of the header . Inside each barge were the driver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another barge would have been emptied , and it would move under the header 's conveyor ; the filled barge would be driven to a stack site , where it would be unloaded by its // two occupants onto what would eventually be a stack of wheat heads on short straw . As many as four men would spread the wheat out with pitchforks and build the stack ? ten feet wide at the base , fifteen feet long , and twelve feet high . Several stacks , parallel to each other and faced so that the prevailing summer wind would blow between them , were placed at a site , with just enough space between them to accommodate the extension feeder of a threshing machine . To head wheat and get it into stacks , farmers hired transient labor . The cutting-stacking crew included the header driver , four barge occupants and four or more stack builders ? nine or ten men in all , who must be fed three meals a day . The wheat , being nearly ripe when placed in the stacks , would mature without undue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farm a week to two after cutting was completed . When the threshing machine arrived , the farmer 's wife , again reinforced by neighbor women , teenaged daughters and perhaps a hired girl or two , would prepare meals for the threshing crew ? an engineer , a water hauler , a separator tender , six or eight pitchers who fed the machine from the stacks , four or more wheat haulers and the children who were too young to be employed in the operation directly . Thus , wheat harvest , circa 1895 to 1900 , involved two peaks of concentrated labor and excitement . A lot of critics worry now that farms are becoming factories ; the farm has been becoming a factory for a long time . L I F E O N T H E D R Y L I N E Combines Present-day readers are accustomed to thinking of wheat harvest as a single operation , taking place , on a two-hundredacre farm , in ten days . The machine that does this ? the combine ? is seldom a prospect for analysis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slogan of one manufacturer was , in fact , Once over and it 's all over to symbolize a new era in wheat harvesting . In 1992 , it is common to wonder why wheat harvesting seventy years ago was an exciting time . The excitement has now migrated to caravans of ten to twenty selfpropelled , twelve-foot combines , that are trucked from one community to another , northward as the wheat ripens , from the Texas Panhandle through Oklahoma , Kansas , Nebraska and the Dakotas and on into Canada , starting in early June and working until October . The caravans have their own combine-hauling trucks , mobile shops and mobile homes for workers ; in a word , their own social life . Horses In the wheat binder and its succesors , which dominated the harvesting of hard winter wheat between 1875 and 1920 , power to drive the sickle through the stalks , to push the wheat heads back toward it and onto a platform , to carry the heads and their straw supports across toward already-harvested land , as well as to form the grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ header barge ? all of this horsepower came from real live // horses . The significance of this fact is that the design of the machines and the ways they were used dictated whether or not the horses ' work could be called humane ? that is , regulated to the horses ' needs ? or be intolerantly forced upon the patient beasts . All this is likely to be lost on readers whose experience with harvesting wheat goes back no further than the early 1900s . To a concerned reader , it might seem reasonable that consideration for the farmer 's beloved teams would take preference over keeping the harvest moving at a brisk clip . This would be far from accurate . Conditions in the field ? roughness of ground , thickness of stand of grain , etc. ? vary in such a way that , when the horses most needed consideration , operation of the machine meant that the driver could not allow the animals to slow their pace . When the driver saw a rank patch of wheat he was obliged to force the team 's pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopefully , the rig got past the overload rather than getting stalled and skidded through it , leaving bent stalks and uncut grain behind . In 1880 or 1918 , farmers and horses simply had to cope . After that time , gasoline engines could be used to power the machinery . Without urging the team to a faster pace , the driver could speed up the engine and thus the machinery , while the team 's pace remained constant . In short , Cyrus McCormick 's inventions made demands exactly opposed to horses ' needs for compassionate treatment . By 1923 , the whole harvesting rig was likely to be gasoline-powered and the horses employed elsewhere . In 1900 , a time before most of my readers were born , things were very different , and the difference could account for longer periods of anxiety for farmers , shorter tempers , temptations to 71 L I F E O N T H E D R Y L I N E enlarge their farms inordinately and a host of other conditions , almost all of them bad . In my experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were more able to cling to responsible ways than their Anglo-Saxon , old American family brethren , who subordinated land stewardship to the ethic of being " up and coming . " // AND BUGGY HORSES In 1944 I worked at Waco Army Air Force Base , researching methods to induce aircrew members to speak loudly and clearly enough and to hold their microphones closely enough to their faces so that they could be understood in the din of World War II bomber aircraft . I was on leave from a job as counselor in the Testing and Guidance Program of the University of Texas ' School of Education . On weekends I went home to Austin , by bus or by one of the privately owned taxis that transported thirsty and lonely airmen from Waco to cities like Austin , where , with luck , they might be comforted . One of the domestic joys of these weekends for me was to hold our firstborn , John , on my lap and tell him stories . By far the favorite story was about the pony my siblings and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that Dandy had red spots and white spots and was a much loved and valued creature . From there on , however , a mythical Dandy developed , little impeded by horsiness . Dandy could retrieve boxes from the highest shelves in the kitchen ( " Wiff his lille paws " ) and climb the ladder to the tender of railway engines , escaping burning and abrasion because he wore // " metal mittens . " These deviations from ordinary horse-related limitations came to light , of course , when his mother quizzed him as to how a horse could do such things . In what follows I hope to escape the fantasies that bedevil not only children on the verge of becoming two-year-olds , but mature horsemen giving strictly " factual " accounts of their favorite mounts . Where horses are concerned , I feel I 'm not love-blinded . For me horses are all right , in their place . My sisters are four and two years older than I , and my brother is ten years younger ; thus three of us reached the age when being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time . Our neighbors , the Campbells , provided their children with bicycles , and we envied the Campbell children , but Father did not favor walking sitting down . Neither did he approve of the town banker 's solution to expanded child mobility , which was to provide a Shetland pony . Shetlands had a deserved reputation for being contrary , and their sharp , mule-like hooves were capable of causing severe injury , either from kicks or from stepping on their caretaker 's feet when being groomed . Nevertheless , Father was anything but coldhearted . He kept his eyes open for a suitable mount for us , and , one evening , he came home with a small bay-and-white-painted gelding , bought as a three-year-old . Little did he know ! I still feel pain in recognizing that Father could be deceived about the age of a horse . He routinely looked at their mouths and pronounced their age with confidence . Dandy , the gelding he brought home , had hooves shaped like those of a typical saddle horse , and this , plus the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to convince Father that he had a junior-sized mount for THE FARM us that was of a proper age to be " broke to ride " and that should have a good disposition instead of the willful attitude of the typical Shetland . Dandy was put in the horse barn , not with the other saddle stock in a stall , but in the alley in front of the mangers where handlers walked as they doled oats into manger boxes and climbed the ladder to the loft to fork down hay . Within a short time , and with Father 's connivance , Dandy soon carried one of us on his back whenever we were not employed currying , braiding his mane into pigtails or combing out and braiding up his tail . All this time , Dandy was growing like a weed . It thus came about that Dandy was never broken to ride in the sense usually implied by Western horsemen . He learned to turn in response to pressure of the reins on the side of his neck , " side reining " and to turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs , though this was a little slow because our legs were not long or strong enough at first . What he did n't learn was that , when we rode out of the farmyard into the section-line road , we did not always want to go left , toward the mailbox . One may have his own idea of the nature of this bad habit , but my father had a typically Western way of breaking it . He equipped us with a heavy quirt and instructed us to whip him on the side of his face to make him go the way we wished . I think that Father , like many another , refused to acknowledge that a horse has its own idea of the authority of its rider . I do not have any idea how a child can exert authority convincing to a horse , and without it , conflict between horse and rider is inevitable . No doubt each old hand with horses has a different way of teaching a mount to turn whichever way 75 L I F E O N T H E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But at the operational level , all of the methods would depend upon the animal 's acceptance of the rider 's authority , either through love or fear or a mixture of both . Nevertheless , we enjoyed our pony Dandy , and later , Dandy as full-sized saddle horse . It is only sad that we learned the cowboy 's ethic ? that cruelty is necessary in one 's relation to domestic animals . I still feel badly thinking and writing about it . Two situations illustrate the trouble that ensued when maturity was not taken into account in giving a rider authority over a horse . The first is a cowboy potato race , put on the Trego County Fair program by a committee that my father chaired . The second is an accident that resulted in a concussion suffered by my brother Howard who was riding behind my saddle . Dandy was the mount in each case . In the few years before each County Fair engaged rodeo promoters , there were a few cowhand exercises that gained some popularity as grandstand attractions , put on between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potato race . A half dozen men mounted on saddle horses , each man carrying an oak spear made by whittling a point on a binder-canvas slat about five feet long , gathered at a line just behind a strong wooden box about six inches high and perhaps a foot and a half square . This box was empty . Down the track perhaps seventy yards was another box containing potatoes . At a signal , the riders rode to the full box , attempted to spear potatoes , turn and , evading other contestants en route , deposit the potato in the receiving box . Scorekeepers counted , and the race was timed for a duration that I think might have been five or ten minutes . To say the least , it was a demonstration of rough riding . THE FARM One year , and I think one year only , a race was designated for riders not more than fourteen years of age . In preparation for it , several boys practiced on Sunday afternoons at our neighbors ' farmyard . In these practices , I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be able to crowd up to the boxes , and Dandy and I could n't . On the day of the race , I fully expected to be disgraced . I had not counted on the effect of the grandstand crowd upon the horses . My opponents ' plow horses were thoroughly frightened and could be kept on the track only with difficulty . Dandy ate it up . He promptly galloped to the full box , put a foot in it and waited until I had a potato speared . Then he dodged the opponents ' horses until we had arrived at the receiving box . I think I had to dismount to pull the potato off the stick . Then we went back , speared a piece of a potato and brought it to the proper goal . By that time , the race was over . Dandy and I had put the only potatoes in the end box . We were winners . I was nearly sick with excitement . Horsemen gathered around Dandy , ready to pay good money for him , in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood above it , where he had received a wire cut when he found his foot caught in a barbed wire gate . The cut had long been healed , but the foot was chronically tender . The potato race is my last clear memory of Dandy . He had driven cattle ? on one occasion Father had arranged for me to ride a few miles west of WaKeeney to help a man named Ossie Long drive a few head of cattle to the WaKeeney stockyards . I remember little about this except that Dandy and I found the place where the drive started and that , when the stock was in the railroad stockyards , Long took me to a restaurant where he ordered the traditional cattleman 's breakfast for both // of us : steak and eggs , with coffee . If Father had intended it as a rite of passage , it was ; I never took horses seriously after about that time . Howard 's accident must have been a year or so before the potato race ; Father had sent me to an unfenced pasture north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milked , and Howard was allowed to ride behind me on Dandy . Howard was inclined to wild laughter ? much more so than to attending to instructions , which were to keep a firm grip on straps holding the fenders of the saddle together and terminating in tapered ends about four inches long . We started , as usual , at a gallop , and , about fifty yards beyond our gate , I felt Howard slipping off , head downward . Foolishly , I grasped at his leg , holding it just long enough for Dandy 's rear hoof to catch him on the forehead . I dismounted and gathered him in my arms , and Dandy galloped off for home ? a sure signal to a waiting father that there had been trouble . I think I met Father about halfway down our lane . Howard regained consciousness and mobility fairly quickly ; I think he was taken to Doctor Herrick , and no serious signs were reported . Howard , now seventy-three , still carries a crease in his forehead . I still remember a confused feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the responsibility to keep my brother safe , no matter what . A similar accident happened to Mary . She had gone to round up the milk cows in our home pasture , riding the trotting mare , Queen . At a fast trot , Queen gave a comfortable ride . I do not remember whether Mary came to the house on foot or after remounting . What is evident , however , is that , at the age of eighty-seven , her upper lip has a hardened rib in the middle , not THE FARM very noticeable to the public , where one of Queen 's heelless shoes caught her . Queen , apparently over-playful , had fallen suddenly as she shied after a jackrabbit or slipped on wet grass making a turn . These were not the only incidents ? I could go on to two or three more that occurred by the time I was ready for high school . What do these happenings illustrate ? Many would say that they show that farming is dangerous . // Though Billy was Father 's substitute for Man 0 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prestige they conveyed than for the work they did . The first of these was Belle Brandon , a light bay with dark accents , which we called Lady Belle . Father bought her from someone who worked in the Kansas City stockyards . She was a five-gaited American saddle horse , and I was impressed when I learned that she was shipped to WaKeeney in her own freight car , probably with a manger , hay and pads to protect her . She had many easy-riding gaits , including a running walk , which could cover ground at more than five miles an hour . Her chief virtue , however , was her ability to stand beside a gate , either a tension barbed wire one or a swinging gate , and cooperate while her rider opened or secured it . She had learned the stockyard lessons well . Nevertheless , she did not fit in , either with the hired men or the other horses . WaKeeney bumpkins would have referred to her contemptuously as high schooled . Trained on flat city streets and bridle paths , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by badgers around their den holes , or to run afoul of other obstacles . When this happened , her rider was likely to go headlong to the ground . As a redeeming trait , she was steady as // an anchor for a lariat . The saddle-horse herd , perhaps five horses , often ran in wild games in the pasture , and a horse of low status was likely to be crowded into the fences . These were made of barbed wire , intended to contain cattle , and severe cuts were the result of contact . Excitable Lady Belle was crowded into the wire twice , getting a deep cut on her shoulder each time . The first cut healed in a short time , but the one on the right or " off " shoulder , received a few years later , was deeper . After months of treatment , ending in a period being supported in a sling rigged by our veterinarian , she grew so emaciated and sad that Father asked the vet to destroy her . I think Father 's grief at her passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment gone wrong . Dandy , the painted pony , also received a near-disabling wire cut . This was my fault . I had left a barbed-wire gate too far from the adjoining fences while shooing a calf through the opening on foot , and Dandy , tied to the gatepost , got his right forefoot entangled in the gate . His reaction was to plunge , and the result was a cut along the top of the hoof , which put him out of service for a time but eventually healed . The hoof growing down from that area was never smooth , and when he had been ridden too far on hard ground , the hoof line was likely to be smeared with blood . Any wire cut reduced the cash value of a horse dramatically , taking from fifty to a hundred dollars off the best bid at an auction . ( One of my sister 's welfare clients once referred to an injury incurred by his wife in a way that suggested his devotion : " Ruined her , Mary ; scarred her for life . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection between prestige in the herd and the probability of injury . LIFE ON THE DRY LINE Until his last days he bore no mark of injury except a bold K branded on his near hip , until , long absent from the pasture games , he finally was put into a pasture ? and received a cut to a shoulder similar to the one that had done Lady Belle in . He was too old to hold his own in a bunch of horses in the pasture . Father 's second prestige horse was called Queen at home . She was entered in the records of the Trotting Association as Naida M. I think Father made the name up . Queen would have been called a Standard Bred if she had been properly registered . Queen was a sorrel , with somewhat irregular white markings , and thus looked a bit too informal for high society . She could trot fast , in spite of all this , and she loved to do it . At the Trego County Fair , she pulled a bike , or bicycle-tired racing sulky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trot or pace or the freefor-all . She almost always came in third or better , and sometimes she won . A horse that could be depended upon to place was considered good enough to keep her owner in food and herself in feed , hay and care . Usually , Father allowed one of his driver friends to race her and to keep the greater share of prize money . The driver also paid the entrance fees , which were the main source of the purses . Unlike many racehorses , Queen , full of competitive spirit for a race , calmed down almost immediately after she was off the track . This made her useful as a buggy horse , though using a racehorse on anything heavier than a high-wheeled training cart was frowned upon by serious horsemen . Following Billy 's retirement , Queen became the school buggy horse . Her tenure in this position continued through the school year of 1923 , when my // sisters graduated from high school . Our road to school doubled , for a mile or a little more , that taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " through his work as a saxophonist in local dance bands . When Mary saw Strain 's buggy ahead of us on the road , she would draw up the slack in the reins and cluck to Queen , who did n't need any more encouragement . Queen would elevate herself into racing gear and we would almost fly over the ground . Strain , seeing us coming , would urge his plow horse to ' a gallop , but Queen usually passed him up , reaching the livery barn in a calm though hard-breathing and lathered condition . The liverymen may or may not have told on us , but Queen 's tenure as school horse was brief . Mary and Edith graduated from high school in 1923 , and when I started high school the next September , I drove a Model T Ford . Queen 's racing days were not yet over . In 1925 , an old acquaintance named O. L. Cook , nicknamed Bally , persuaded Father to let him take Queen on the County Fair racing circuit . I think it was at the Hays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career ; she at least passed out of our ken . Cook , a mediocre driver , had been systematically boxed in by other drivers , so that he could not get Queen into the open to compete with the favored horse ? as often as not a black pacer owned by a man named Fred Mangold . The races were run as best three of five heats , and the heats were separated by perhaps a half-hour , while other grandstand attractions were paraded before the ticket holders . As it was told to us later , Bally had been boxed out of competition in the first two heats of a race , whereupon he addressed the offending drivers in a towering rage , saying , " If you try that again , I 'm going to shut my eyes and drive right over // you . " A few breaths later , he fell to the ground , with a stroke . Fred Wolf , a seasoned driver who had not been racing , took Queen to the post in the next three heats , winning them all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds ? probably the best she had ever posted . Wolf , of course , knew only that Cook had become incapacitated and was carried off to an ambulance . The word that he had died came later in the afternoon . We heard of the incident only secondhand , though from witnesses considered reliable ; by that time our family was immersed in the garage business . THE FARM TRACTOR COMES TO WHEAT COUNTRY I must have been past thirteen years of age when Father told me the story of WaKeeney 's Gasoline Power Machinery Company ( GPMC ) , which set up a large corrugated iron machine shop in which machinist Charles Steinberg held sway . Apparently GPMC was an attempt to set up , in the heart of the wheat country , a factory to produce a tractor that would motorize ploughing and seeding wheat fields . Stock must have been sold because the size of the machine shop building and the extensive shafting for machine belts indicated that the lathe , power hacksaw , shaper and mill that Steinberg employed had once been part of a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the first tractor model was assembled and tried out . It could , Father said , just about pull itself on level ground , with no load attached . This , I took it , was not Steinberg 's fault but that of the engineers who had furnished the design . It may well have been that the promoters of GPM , to use the tractor 's name , were more interested in promoting the factory than in making tractors . In my youth I knew Steinberg as the man who could overhaul auto engines , making the new piston rings from slices // of oversized iron pipe with the proper amount cut away and the whole rounded up again . Steinberg also sold gas engines suitable for pumping water when the wind failed , as it once did for a whole month , while a horse-and-a-half gas engine with hit-andmiss governor pumped water for our horses and cattle . Steinberg was an early director of the WaKeeney Band , which employed downtown businessmen as musicians . The Band lived through my youth , often being directed by the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been recruited into field work with horse and mule teams . From the seat of horse-drawn plows I witnessed the real beginning of the use of tractors as prime movers in farm field work . By 1924 , the Wallis , the McCormick-Deering and the Twin City , patterned after the automobile but more rugged , the Rumley Oil-Pull , the Hart-Parr and the Waterloo Boy , resembling scaled-down versions of the gasoline or kerosene-burning engines that had replaced steamers as threshing power , were being seen as our hired man and I drove our six-horse and four-horse teams to and from plowing in wheat fields during late July and August . In the autumn of 1923 I started high school , and in the fall of 1925 Father joined a pair of WaKeeney bankers in a partnership ( he was the visible one , they the silent ) to buy an automobile garage in WaKeeney . A year earlier Sam Campbell had bought a garage business from Fritz Staatz and had moved his family into WaKeeney to run it . Campbell was not comfortable in the garage business and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's banker friends and Father himself guessed that Staatz would not be happy until he was back in the garage business . // They schemed to buy the garage from Campbell and sell it back to Staatz , who had broken ground for a hotel across the alley from it . They were only partly right . Staatz wanted a garage to go with his hotel , but when he saw the play developing he conferred with the insurance authorities and found that he could combine hotel and garage in one building . The bankers were stuck with their investment , and so was Father . Worse yet , Father , as front man , was stuck with running a garage . I think he was ambivalent about the garage . Father 's principal interest in machines at the time was not in how they worked , but in whether they would make money for him . Still , the garage would provide a channel through which Father could direct my energies . It would also allow him to use the services of Mary , who was his strong helper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of almost everyone else . Father and his backers promptly secured the Chrysler franchise for WaKeeney and the surrounding area . We dealt with the Salina distributor-dealer , Breon-Hudgins Motor Company , which later became Bert Breon Motor Company . Chrysler was just then finishing its first triumphant year . Two years later , when I had graduated from high school and become a full-time member of the garage venture as a tyro mechanic , a slow-talking but persuasive block salesman for the John Deere Plow Company called on Father and told him that the John Deere agency in town was being closed and invited him to take the franchise . The bait for the deal was the then-new John Deere Model D tractor , presented as the simplest , most fuelefficient and maneuverable answer to the prayers of the farmer who could no longer produce enough wheat on the land he owned ( or could rent on shares ) to feed his family and send 87 L I F E O N T H E D R Y L I N E children of both sexes to college . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew horseflesh could make a killing relieving farmers of their outdated plow teams in trade for the required cash down payment for a Model D tractor , then selling the farmer 's trade-in at Saturday afternoon auctions in the vacant lot adjacent to the garage . I remember my horror at the prospect of mechanical work on something so far from Chryslers and Buicks and Packards ; I would later recollect that intuition is a poor guide . In the years up to the Depression 's 1929 beginning in the East and its descent on the high plains in advance of the dust storms of 1934 , I became as happy with work as I have ever been . Quick help was essential to a farmer whose tractor had died in the furrow ; I could usually revive it . When I could , the farmer was truly grateful ; if parts had to be ordered from Kansas City , the farmer was usually patient . At eighty-four , I see this period as the one when I was easy in the saddle and on top of the job . AUTOMOBILING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacement of the horse by the tractor in farm fields ; the growth , flowering and senescence of the American automobile industry ; the decline of railroads as haulers of passengers and freight ; and the appearance of all-weather farm-to-market roads in Western Kansas . These roads have replaced , first , meandering ruts , then section-line roads on which farmers worked out their poll taxes and mired their vehicles . Broad outlines of this period have had adequate documentation , particularly in romanticized fiction . Stylized postcards of 1911 to 1916 show wasp-waisted women , well hatted and veiled , riding in the left-hand front seats of early Buicks and Oldsmobiles , protected from dust and grime by cream-colored linen dusters that swept from throat to ankle . My mother wore one of these on the infrequent family outings in our Regal 30 ( for thirty horsepower ) . Father had paid Bud Jones , son of WaKeeney 's leading physician , a little more than a thousand dollars for it in July 1911 , when I was nearing my third birthday . I can remember reading the embossed REGAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we still had the car in 1914 or 1915 , when my progress through two grades of school would have enabled me to read . 91 L I F E O N T H E D R Y L I N E Most of the Regal 's mileage was racked up taking Father to cry farm sales , or to WaKeeney for groceries and other small items . On summer afternoons we would see our mongrel , Shep , start up the farm lane ; one of my sisters would shout , " Poppy 's a comin ' , " and three children and a dog would race out the farm lane and up toward the farm 's northwest corner , where Father would stop to let the three small humans into the back seat for a ride into the farmyard . Unless there were Jonathan apples , I would not have been interested in groceries taken to Mother in the house ; I would be examining the carbide generator and smelling the slight leaks of acetylene gas that fueled the Regal 's headlights . Later , this device was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and off with a fascinating key . We surviving Masons are fortunate that I was too small or too fearful to find where Father hid the key and turn the gas on . At night , the headlamps created a dramatic spot of bright , safe , yellow light , a wonderland separated from the surrounding fearsome dark . I remember only one family trip in the Regal . Grandfather Mason and Father 's older brother Charley had settled in Dodge City , an even hundred miles south of WaKeeney , where they had a truck garden and small farm , and we went to visit them . The way towns were Ransom , at about twenty-five miles , then Ness City , Jetmore and finally Dodge City . There was an established route that was marked but not maintained as a highway . Three memories of the trip persist . I found that a town could contain hills ? a great surprise because WaKeeney was essentially level . Second , the Regal overheated on the way home , and Father stopped near a pond to get water . Part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with snap-over-center 92 T H E G A R A G E folding braces to bring it from a crumpled disk to about twogallon size . When Father straightened these braces out , the canvas splintered into shreds . The manufacturer had neglected to impregnate the fabric with anything to resist mold . Father 's Stetson did the job , however . It was made to stand up to all kinds of weather . My third enduring memory is of a bull nettle plant , which I saw as an oversized sandbur , and avoided . We doubtless had them in WaKeeney , but I had not noticed them . Here beside the pond where Father watered our metal steed , the plant stood out . Sometimes Father drove the Regal or rode with one of his WaKeeney friends to Ransom or to Collyer , another nearby town , to attend Sunday afternoon baseball games . Town Commercial Clubs promoted these games and furnished uniforms for the young farmers and clerks who made up the teams . For important games , a team 's management would import a professional pitcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do the same . Thus the outcomes of the games could present problems for bettors . Would the merits of the regular team members , those of the hirelings , or collusion between the pitchers , decide the game ? Trips to games offered local sports opportunities to test the merits of their cars ; it was not acceptable to allow a townsman to pass one on the road . As time went on , John Spena , the local Ford dealer , became the man to beat ; thus the Model T revolution came to WaKeeney , where Spena 's firm , having graduated from setting up windmills to pump water for livestock , ruled supreme until well after World War I and survived through the Model A , the briefly manufactured B and the early flathead V8 . In later // years there was to be competition , but before World War I , the Model T was what farmers could afford and what they wanted and bought . Sometime in 1915 or 1916 the Regal was given a rough coat of paint , the tattered top was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used car . Then Father seemed to come home in a different car every day or two , the most-remembered being a Decatur , a noisy machine that I think was air-cooled . I remember it because , when Father put me aboard for the last quarter mile of his trip home , I got a headache . It was my first headache , and I have remembered it and the Decatur together . Soon , however , we had a shiny brass-radiatored Model T Ford , with a box full of buzzing coils projecting from the dash into the front compartment . The steering column and controls were on the left ? something other cars were to copy , but the left front panel , where the door should have been , was seamless from dash to the back of the driver 's seat . To mount from the left , as a horseman preferred , drivers had to climb over the panel , and they usually did . By 1916 the whip socket , evident on cars earlier than the Regal , had disappeared . Father , like many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new one every year , but this pattern was interrupted when industry was mobilized to implement World War I. I think our last Model T " open " or " touring " car was a 1917 . Whatever year it was , it was the one on which nonskid tires were introduced . They were imprinted with the words , one above the other , NON SKID , printed diagonally across the treads . When the tires did not skid , they made an interesting pattern in mud . Along with nonskid tires came a rash of punctures . There were two reasons for this . The NON SKID // projections on the new Ford 's tires were not molded on top of an already adequate coat of rubber , but were formed by making the intervening and surrounding rubber coatings thinner . A short tack could easily puncture this thin rubber . Second , perhaps as a result of an assembly-line speedup , tacks in the gimp that finished seams in the car 's upholstery were not seated solidly , and they tended to be shed by the dozen when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction , and the compound-action tire pumps , with one large and one small cylinder , gave drivers a great deal of exercise between curses . Many drivers carried a spare tube , preferably a new one . Father , at least , discovered early that the spare tube should not be carried in its cardboard box . The cardboard would chafe a hole in the tube . That , or faulty cold-patch material , or depleted cement , could make a flat tire a real emergency . Fortunately , on dry roads , one could drive a Model T on the wheel rim , without the tire , though this took a toll on the wheel , to say nothing of the rest of the car and its occupants . After World War I , new Fords were provided with selfstarters . I remember trying out ours repeatedly while Father was away from the barn where the car was stored , until the battery was too low to start it . Father was gentle about reminding me that I should n't do this . He explained the whole mechanism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know that guilt was sufficient punishment . A battery that was too low to start the car would still furnish current for ignition , and the crank and front choke wire , needed for hand starting , were retained up to 1927 , when production was shut down for changeover to produce the Model A. // To save money and to be independent of town garages and their repair bills , farmers learned to do almost everything needed to keep a Model T running . They also ordered , from Montgomery Ward or Sears Roebuck , such accessories as exhaust manifold , front compartment heaters , distributor ignition systems and even sixteen-valve racing-type cylinder heads , as well as special carburetors . Most Fords were plain Janes , but some were real dolls . Sagging fenders could be braced with baling wire wound over the radiator 's refill spout and down to the other fender or the headlight standard . Baling wire is often scoffed at by city dudes , but it is strong , about the right size for many jobs and soft enough to be shaped easily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulated wires connected the four buzzing ignition coils to a wiping timer at the front end of the Model T engine 's camshaft . When this loom became oil-soaked and frayed , farmers replacing it would agonize over getting everything connected correctly . At the top , the loom 's wires emerged from the sheath to match the proper coils , but at the timer , at the front of the engine , one either had to know the wires by position and color or to install them counterclockwise on terminals for cylinders one , two , four , then three ? often too much of a mental chore for a farmer who distrusted his mechanical ability and was almost mortally afraid of electricity . One summer at wheat harvest time , our Ford began to misfire , and a transient worker , who claimed experience at the Ford factory in Detroit , offered to install a new timer and loom of wires if Father would provide them . The yokels gathered around fully expecting the braggart to fail . To everyone 's surprise , it took the man no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything secured . There was no misfiring and no need to do anything over . Surely the man must have worked at the factory . One of the first repairs made to a near-new Model T was to replace the choke wire , which extended through the radiator shell and terminated in a neat ring large enough that a finger of the left hand of the cranker could pull on it while one turned the crank with the right . To start a cold engine , one pulled on the choke until the engine fired , and the cranker invariably bent the choke wire , or " gooser " as it was called , back and forth where it emerged . A " new " choke would be made from baling wire , often not very well aligned and threaded . After self-starters became available , a second choke rod was provided which projected near the driver 's right hand . A cold engine still had to be cranked by hand , and the small boy who was to man the topside " gooser " was apt to hear the grunt-punctuated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Model T would run merrily on the lowtension magneto which was part of the engine 's flywheel , but cold , stiff oil could prevent the cranker from bringing the flywheel up to speed for an adequate spark . Another condition that could weaken the magneto spark was end play in the engine crankshaft , which would allow the magnet-bearing flywheel to travel too far back , away from the coils that the magnets were to activate . To cope with both of these troubles , the switch in the driver 's compartment had three positions : Mag , Off and Bat . A steel-encased set of four National Carbide dry cells could be connected between the bat terminal and engine frame ; this would furnish an enhanced spark for starting . Once started , the // engine always ran better on magneto . The dry-cell set , called a hotshot , often deteriorated and suddenly went dead on cold mornings . Another handicap to cold-weather starting was tooheavy engine oil . There was a special oil intended for Model T Fords , marketed as Mobiloil E. It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission bands that ran in engine oil to engage smoothly . Farmers almost never used Mobiloil E. Long before the owner felt he could afford a ring-andvalve job , oil consumption had led to the use of heavier and heavier oil , until a grade called SAE 50 , Special Heavy , was in use . In winter time , it was thick as molasses . It was standard safety practice , in cranking cold Fords , to place a block in front of one or both rear wheels ; otherwise the transmission drag would cause the car to creep forward while cranking and , upon starting , to bore ahead with sinister force . There was a ready remedy for cold weather starting . One could block one rear wheel , jack up the other and place the transmission control lever in high gear . Thus the jacked-up wheel would serve as an additional flywheel , the car would not creep forward , and much of the oil drag would be avoided . The unbalanced rear wheel would cause the car , once started , to bounce merrily on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed by being butted by a Model T. At any rate , after cranking a Model T for a half-hour , one may not value his life highly . Being run over or butted while cranking a car is distinct as a threat from that of having the engine " kick , " which has had more publicity . When a gas engine is timed to run , the spark occurs slightly before top-center of the compression stroke , so that the air-gas mixture will have a small fraction of a second to // kindle before exploding to force the piston down . At cranking speed , this may be too much spark advance and cause the engine to start backwards or " kick . " When the kick is against a self-starter mechanism , little damage occurs , since the starter is built to stand such strain . A man 's forearm and wrist are not designed for this , however , and an engine kick can cause severe injury . There were two mutually exclusive folk remedies for preventing injury when an engine kicked . In one , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the crank , so that a kick would force the handle away from the hand and out of it , thus avoiding breaking a bone by sheer force . The other precaution was to make sure the thumb was " opposed " to the fingers , giving a full grip to the handle , so that the cranker 's arm could resist the kick and avoid having the flying handle bruise or break the cranker 's wrist . Such logical contradictions in folk lore seem purposeful ? to fuel arguments . The best advice , as usual , was more conservative : retard the spark enough that the engine could only start forward . But if the retard was too much , the engine might be unlikely to fire at all . Today , experts have a still better suggestion : keep the car in a heated garage . If one drives in an Alaskan winter , friends tell me , he garages the car without being urged . 99 H I G H S C H O O L In the spring of 1923 my sisters , Edith and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was five years old , too young to start grade school . I , having just graduated from grade school , would enter Trego Community High School in September . The summer found me in an awkward stage of growth . There were the first long trousers and oxfords , not high shoes , for dress occasions . I remember being seized by an insane desire to splash through puddles left by rain , spattering my new trousers and soaking the new shoes . I simply found myself doing this , without plan , and felt embarrassed that Mother did not scold me . Custom and physiology dictated that I should be taken seriously ? one was called upon in high school by the title Mister or Miss ? and the duties I was given at home reflected this . Father felt it was time to sell the old Ford and buy a new one , but John Spena , our dealer , did not have a Model T touring car in stock . Father was , or pretended to be , too busy to take the Union Pacific daily local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the needed cars were on hand . He warned the bank of what he was doing and gave me a signed blank check for the amount of the price of the new car . I was to get on the jitney at ten o'clock in the morning in WaKeeney , get off at Ellis , where the train // remained for nearly an hour , go to the Ford agency and offer the salesperson the check , provided that the car be equipped with a spare tire . By this time Model Ts came with demountable rims , but the fifth rim was bare . Getting a tire placed on it was something one attempted to do without being charged for the tire and tube ; he could probably accomplish this by paying cash without any tradein . If the Ellis dealer would not accept this deal , I was to go on to Hays , try there , and if there was no positive answer there , I was to return on the jitney , which left Hays after noon and arrived in WaKeeney at about two o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the avuncular salesmen in both Ford agencies refused to supply the required spare tire ? it was the easiest way to get rid of a youth who seemed so unsure of himself , and who was , besides , small for his age . I returned to WaKeeney by train . Father was crying a small sale on a lot near the east side of town , and I walked there from the depot and reported to him as he passed from one lot of machinery to another . Included in the sale was an Oakland touring car , and Father knocked it down to a surprised Burl Frazier , who knew that Father wanted the car himself and would settle for it . The car was the last item sold , and we prepared to drive it home . Father suggested that I drive . I " knew " how one drove a gearshift car and had driven many miles in a Model T. The first move was to back the car in a wide arc , then drive forward out of the yard and into the street . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon at the end of the backing up . Father inspected everything for damage , found none , and we proceeded home . He never bought a new Ford after that , though , of course , in the garage business he would own plenty of used ones . // The Oakland became my transportation for the first two years of high school . Youths were allowed to drive in the rural areas at that time ; adults did not need licenses . When licenses were introduced within the next few years , persons over fourteen or fifteen were " grandfathered " in as existing drivers at the time of the law 's passage . I vaguely remember some sort of driver 's license being granted , but I 'm sure I was not examined for driving ability . At any rate , there was a short period , before I was licensed to drive in town , when I parked the Oakland at the Trego County Fairgrounds , which were just across the street from the high school . Within a short time I was driving downtown to the post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ susceptible female students I found walking to school alone . Many accepted , but none lingered . What I was to do when high school was finished was put on hold ? I never thought about it , but I 'm sure my father did . I was not rugged enough to be a farmer , and Father , at one time or another , had said that the only persons he would be associated with in business were members of his own family , because they were the only ones he could trust . He bought and sold livestock with the bankers , but he knew that they would never consider him a full partner . That judgment was due to change in a short time . Looking back from 1992 , it is easy to see that Father had two sorts of worries concerning me and that he spent time , money and devotion coping with them . Beginning about summer 1922 , I began to feel tired most of the time , and as soon as I 'd finished with a duty , I tended to lie down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urine tests and found sugar , suggesting diabetes mellitus . He recommended Doctor W. W. Duke of Kansas // City as a specialist in internal medicine , and Father and I made several trips by train to see him , staying at the Rasbach Hotel on Wyandotte Street while tests and treatment were in progress . On the trip made in summer 1923 , I became one of the early users of insulin , which at that time was not well standardized , and which was administered by subcutaneous injection about thirty minutes before each of the three meals per day . Doctor Duke 's treatment combined diet ? a rather thin one ? with insulin , so that I experienced frequent periods of dizziness and , at first , double vision . Nevertheless , I began to feel better ? if not from the treatment , then from the chance to stay at a hotel , eat hamburgers at a small lunchroom nearby and attend moving pictures with Father in the evenings , at such theaters as the Newman , the Electric and Frank Newman 's Royal . Stage bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember , was Rudy Vallee 's . There was a bit of business in these presentations . In one skit a bandsman donned a fedora , walked across the stage , and , on turning toward backstage , said , " Prosperity is just around the corner . " This was , of course , a slogan of the Hoover administration , and the country did not turn the corner . This must have been after 1929 , long after our early trips ? after , indeed , we had been in the garage business for some time ? but the whole period of treatment in Kansas City is seamless in my memory , held together by a sort of unconscious puzzlement concerning my father 's long period of patient care for me and the tardy realization that , at the time , I did not really appreciate his sacrifice . I simply took it for granted , worrying mildly about the cost but completely confident that what was needed would be forthcoming . 103 L I F E O N T H E D R Y L I N E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father bought the Dodge Business Men 's Coupe . The Oakland had begun to use a great deal of oil , and Father 's automobile maven , the blacksmith Harry Reichard , told him that the car had a hollow crankshaft oiling system , and that these tended to throw so much oil around that slightly worn pistons and rings led to extravagant oil consumption . There was , at the time , little to do about it except to abandon the car . ( I was later to learn that 1924 or 1925 was the date for introduction of ventilated oil rings with scraper rings above them , which , after many experiments financed by the automobile-buying public , eventually brought oil consumption under control . ) Following his expert 's advice , Father went looking in the used-car places in Kansas City for a suitable automobile . What he bought was a dumpy , hard-riding Dodge that combined some innovations destined to last and some that should have lasted but did not . One that lasted was the all-steel body . The manufacturer had found ways to secure upholstery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dunked in an enameling vat , dripped-dry and baked , and the result was a finish that could , when dulled , be restored to brightness by a polish called Common Sense . ( It might have been dubbed Hard Labor with more justice . ) Another innovation eventually taken up by the industry was a twelve-volt battery . In the Dodge version , the battery was recharged and the car started by a single chain-driven unit , mounted on the left side of the engine . Instead of the crashing sound of a Bendix Drive engaging a flywheel , the Dodge cranked quietly with its chain . If , as sometimes happened , the chain came unpinned while the engine was idling , the immediate increase in // idling speed told of the power required to induce the generator part of the unit to keep the battery up . The Business Coupe would go about sixty-five miles per hour under normal conditions , and I never found out how much faster it would go with the startergenerator chain broken . The whole body of the car took on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that fifty became the speed we traveled . Any faster speed was used only for passing . Perhaps the most important innovation of the early Dodge was use of Budd all-steel wheels . These were discs of strong steel , with lock rings to hold the tires in place , and they worked quite well . Other manufacturers were slow to follow along , however , keeping wheels with short wooden spokes until the late 1920s . All-metal wheels had to wait , generally , until drop-center rims were made popular by the Ford Model A. When tires fit loosely on wheels , as they did in racing machines used on dirt tracks , and on early Model As , it was possible for a strong man to bring the tire beads together opposite the valve stem , push the beads down into the drop-center well and remove the beads , one at a time near the valve stem , without tools . Today , safety dictates that the tire beads fit tightly on the wheels , and , while the wheels have drop-center rims , power tools are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tires are among the key elements of the automobile that have undergone progressive change in the interest of more comfortable riding and , incidentally , less shaking apart of the car itself . The clincher rims of the Model T required tires whose beads were formed with strong cotton cords , elastic enough to be stretched over a clincher rim , the profile of which was a thin capital C. The beads were shaped to clinch // under the horns of the C ; thus , they held the inflated tube in and the tire on the wheel . The 1924 Buicks were , I think , the first production cars to employ four-wheel brakes and the first to use the then-new balloon tires , doubtless named in a takeoff on the aircraft industry , where it had been found that it was cheaper and more satisfactory to cushion landing gears with big fat tires on small wheels than to design elaborate shock absorbers of other kinds ? though the steel and spring parts of aircraft suspensions were far from simple . At any rate , balloon and semi-balloon tires came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first way an ordinary mechanic came to notice this was that the sizes of the tires were no longer designated by the tire diameter exposed to the road and the diameter or " fatness " of the tire itself . On the 1923 Dodge , the tires were called 33 by 4 1/2 , and a 32 by 4 would fit the same rim . On the first model of Chrysler Six , in 1925 , the tires were 20 by 5.77 inch size , and a 20 by 5.25 , a lighter tire , would fit the same rim . Wheel diameter , rather than outside tire diameter , designated tire size . Balloon tires shifted the cushioning job toward tires and away from springs and made the tires and wheels , the unsprung parts of the road-to-body connection , heavier . They also required jacks for changing tires to start at shorter lengths and extend farther , to lift a tire clear of the road . Moreover , the heavier tires required reengineered suspensions to prevent both low- and high-speed shimmy , at speeds , for the former , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter at something above fifty . Brave engineers and patient customers and mechanics were still engaged in this problem when our family bought a new // Chevrolet Carryall in 1950 . We now drive a 1979 Ford , and it seems to be quite stable , not oversensitive to slight imbalance of wheels and not inclined to shimmy , wander or , with its power steering , be hard to maneuver and park . The newer cars may be even better , but the way from 1924 to 1979 was not easy for anyone involved with automobiles . Tire pressures for models in the 1920s were about sixty-five pounds per square inch ; they descended into the lower twenties for the early balloons , came up to about thirty-five for a time , then descended to the upper twenties and lower thirties for the radial tires that are now preferred equipment on passenger cars and trucks . Along the way , inner tubes and the flaps that guarded them from the roughness of wheel rims have disappeared . One can expect , nowadays , to put a set of four new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with good luck and a tire store that will change them about from front to back occasionally , run them until they wear out completely , almost simultaneously . It 's a long way back to the NON SKID Firestones of the 1916 Model T , the tacks from its upholstery gimp that could flatten two or three of the tires within a few miles and to the roads that became shining ribbons of meandering ruts whenever there was a good rain . ON MY OWN AS MECHANIC Soon after I graduated from high school , in May 1927 , our mechanic Paul Clem was killed in an accident . Clem was our master mechanic . We had a toilet room in which there was a lamp socket screwed to a two-by-four stud . The wiring on the socket was open . When we wanted light , we merely screwed the bulb in . It seems that Clem , depressed and possibly fogged with whiskey , broke the bulb in his hand and fell against the wiring and a cast-iron pipe . Father said that Clem shouted and Father pulled him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called our physician . None of us knew how to apply artificial respiration . Doctor Herrick came quickly , but not quickly enough . Hall Van Meter , a local telephone man also came ; Van Meter tried for some time to get Clem to breathe , but he was gone . I had been at lunch . When I returned , Clem 's body was on the shop floor , Van Meter was just rising from it , a few others were standing near , and Father was crying like a child . It was the first time I can remember seeing my father cry . I was sad for Clem , but I saw no great problem in taking up full responsibility for the shop . Thus when , one forenoon a few weeks later , a call came that a Willys Knight Six had died in the road about six miles west of WaKeeney , I answered the call THE GARAGE and towed the car back to the garage . It was a puzzling mechanical situation . There was a fat spark , which occurred at the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tested for timing through a pipe plug in the exhaust manifold , opened and closed at the proper points . The carburetor bowl was full . I was puzzled hut not distressed . I reasoned that one of the fine passages in the " Tillotson carburetor must be clogged , so I dissembled it , spreading the parts out on a wiping cloth on the bench . When the whole thing had been cleared with compressed air , I reassembled it and reinstalled it . I made sure that the standard approximate adjustments were made . Nevertheless , I was not much surprised when the engine did not start . My mind had become more and more uncomfortable as I worked . The gasoline smell did not seem authentic . Furthermore , the fluid in the carburetor did not sting my hands . It seemed oily . Finally , truth dawned . The gasoline would not burn in a Willys Knight Six , even in one warmed up and on the road . It was easy to check out the matter . Gasoline was sucked , about a quart at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warner vacuum tank and dumped into the line to the carburetor . Draining the vacuum tank , filling it with Red Crown ethyl gasoline , and pressing the starter promptly revived the Willys Knight Six . Everyone was happy , though I was a bit confused . Why , I wondered , had I not sniffed out the trouble earlier ? The reason , on reflection , was that , up to that time , we had had little trouble with the fuel quality of gasoline . The owner of the Willys Knight Six had filled his nearempty tank with gasoline at a Derby station on the highway , which now bypassed WaKeeney 's downtown area . The Derby // Company was not able to police its stations , and the local man had gone to buying gasoline from the Southeast Kansas oil fields in tank car lots , warehousing it in tanks behind his station and selling some to drivers-by and more to farmers for use in their tractors . The Willys Knight Six became the leader of a sad procession . Within a few days , I was called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed its run the day before but had refused to start in the morning . One started a cold Model D by squirting a small amount of gasoline into each of its two priming cups , then , after rocking the flywheel back and forth a few times , bringing it smartly over top center , whereupon it would start up , blowing merrily from the still-open priming cups . I could thus check the tractor with " good " gasoline as priming fluid and determine whether or not it would continue to run on fuel from its tank . This diagnosis did not take long . When the prime had blown , the engine died . The farmer did not need to abandon the fuel in the tractor 's main tank . The Model D was often fueled with kerosene or diesel fuel . It had a small tank compartment in which volatile gasoline could be kept to be used for cold starting and for warming the engine to the point where it would digest kerosene . What my customer had to do was to rename his fuel kerosene and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Derby station , it is not likely that the station owner had a severe problem . As a tank car of gasoline was sold slowly , the fuel would separate , the heavier fractions settling to the bottom . The first gasoline sold would be relatively light , or volatile ? fine for running automobiles or starting Model Ds ? but as time went on , the product would become heavier and // heavier . Possibly only a fraction of a tank car load would be bad enough to be completely unsalable . By quickly getting in a new supply of fresh gasoline , the whole tank could be stirred up , and who would know ? Life might resume without significant interruption ! In the matter of usable gasoline , this story features Standard Oil Company of Indiana as white knight and the local Derby dealer as rascal . This was not the only or even the typical pattern . The proliferation of competing oil companies that sold at retail tended to keep gasoline supplies up to a usable standard . Oil companies installed their own filling stations across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these company-owned stations . The majority of retail outlets for gasoline and motor oil were still , in our part of the country , locally owned and operated in the early 1930s . At the pump , motor oil sold for twenty-five to forty cents per quart , and the ring-and-piston seals of most engines required that oil be added every two hundred miles ? more often if the engine was worn . At our garage , Polarine , Standard Oil Company 's brand , sold for twenty-five cents per quart ; Mobiloil , advertised and marketed by Standard of New York , brought thirty cents . Quaker State , refined from Pennsylvania crude , went for thirty-five cents . In carload lots of about thirty-five hundred gallons , Polarine could be bought for fifty-five to sixty-five cents per gallon . Each brand was dispensed from its own company 's distinctively marked fifty-five gallon drum by means of a pump that got up a quart at a time . A funnel-hooded quart tankard , held under the pump spout , assured the buyer of full measure . As time went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // premium grade oil were less freshly painted than those of Polarine and its cousins . That my father cheated by refilling other brand barrels with Polarine kept me near depression . I could not quit ; there were no other jobs . I could not confront him . Indeed , he was no more culpable than any similar merchant up or down the highway . Beginning with Mobiloil and Quaker State , oil companies began marketing motor oil in quart cans made of treated cardboard , with crimped tin ends . Guilt , all around , probably prolonged use of these containers , so that it is only within the past few years that more convenient and rationally shaped plastic quart containers have come into use . Other aspects of automobile maintenance could be subjects for essays , almost all of them sad . Factory-sponsored dealerships are supposed to guarantee good workmanship at fair prices ? sometimes the guarantee holds , sometimes it does n't . Automobiles evolve into more and more throwaway units , including throwing away the entire machine before the owner is really acquainted with his new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new products ? seldom do we find contented owners or dealers . Quality of life seems to evade us. // In the first few garage years , we did a brisk business . Father had many acquaintances ; we had many of the old Staatz and Campbell customers and Highway 40 brought summer tourists past our door . Mary came aboard as telephone answerer , bookkeeper and , more and more , as collector of overdue bills . I worked after school and during the summers . It was a surprise , then , to have Father take on the John Deere agency in 1928 . WaKeeney had a Farmers Union Cooperative that had sold Deere machinery , but it was were phasing out that part of its business . Deere had recently bought the Waterloo Boy tractor company , of Moline , Illinois , and in its factory brought out the John Deere Model D tractor . The Model D featured a horizontal two-cylinder engine , fully enclosed driving parts and a degree of simplicity of operation and repair that was remarkable . There was no part that could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plowed field with tools one man could bring to the job . Never were more than two men required on the job , and I finally learned to manage even the heaviest jobs by myself if help was not nearby . In spite of this , I was deeply disappointed , at first , in becoming a tractor mechanic and one associated with an uneven-firing tractor at that . // My initial discouragement did not last long . Father sent me to deliver new tractors and to answer service calls . Whenever there had been trouble I knew that it was my duty to stay with the farmer until the machine was doing its job . Thus , I had many hours in the country , which I soon preferred to the shop . A tourist might fret and twitch when he saw an immature youth attack the ignition or carburetor on his Packard , but a farmer whose equipment was stalled rejoiced when he saw me coming and watched me work , not to criticize but to anticipate what I needed to speed the repair . When the repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time or two , he was truly grateful . Deere 's salesmen , called block men , showed good judgment about what machines to stock and did not try to overload us . This was important because machines carried over past the season of use were covered by notes , signed by Father , that would begin drawing eight percent interest at a certain time . Farmers often got bargains when dealers were faced with the prospect of paying interest through the winter . Two John Deere mechanics also answered field calls ; they were experts and good men . One was Sam Sechler , who answered when a six-hole corn sheller we had sold began to give trouble . He timed the sheller as it filled a fifty-bushel wagon , and when this took about seven minutes he was unhappy . Inspection showed that the custom workload had worn out the shelling parts ; the owner had been so busy making money that he had lost track of the amount shelled . Furthermore , his laborers were feeding the machine with wheat scoops instead of wire-bottomed ones . Our part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers did not have the sievetype shovels that would have let dirt fall to the ground instead of // going through the machine . Sechler was an affable man , and without trying he made friends for the company . Another mechanic who helped us a great deal was named Duncan . Not as breezy as Sechler , he still had a keen sense of humor . On one occasion he came out from Kansas City to help a German-Russian customer 's two grown sons assemble a big combine they had bought . It was a sixteen-foot machine , with an extension to the cutting platform that enabled it to cut a twenty-foot swath . As the three men worked , Duncan observed that the two boys used their Low-German dialect to converse with each other in his presence and made him feel invisible . After the boys had made a few remarks questioning Duncan 's integrity and perhaps his ancestry also , Duncan asked one of them for a match ? in the dialect . That ended the German speaking , he told us later . Father hired many laborers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines , which came by freight , partly assembled . One of these was Bill Markle , who did a good job at assembling , but had wild ways with our old cars and trucks . We kept some farming operations going during these days , and when Bill went to haul some hay at the farm , I tensed up , waiting for the inevitable call . Something , from a rear axle to a doorpost in the hay barn , was sure to give way . Markle also entertained us with stories of his cowboy-like deeds . To my surprise , he matured , moved to Denver and got a job with the Deere distributor there . He got married , and when my brother Howard visited him at work in the 1950s , he was in charge of crating machines for shipment to dealers . It was Mary , however , who anchored our relations with farm customers and the plow company . Many customers were // German-Russian immigrants . They had trouble with our language , but Mary could take the two-inch thick Plow Works Catalog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they needed . Rail service was good then , and a quick letter to Kansas City could bring the part back on the local jitney train within a few days . If there was a real rush , Mary used the telephone and , with an early call and good luck , got the part the next day . When all else failed , Mary and the farmer descended upon me and asked if I could weld the broken part . I remember one evening when I gave up my dreary mooning over some indifferent high-school beauty and welded each of about forty small teeth to a cast-iron corn planter gear . The machine was hopelessly out of date , and only heroic measures could save it . I still remember my growing wonder as tooth after tooth flowed into a smooth bead under the torch . Welding cast with flux and a mild steel rod was not unheard of , but I knew that I was a sloppy welder , and that I was working above my skill level . Nevertheless the gear worked and with very little hand filing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wally Warren , Father 's legendary threshing engineer , who could always pick up enough junk at the scene of an emergency to fashion a fix . // When Staatz built the garage Father and his partners later bought from Campbell , he had equipped it with a steam heating system , intended to burn stoker coal . There was a high chimney that looked sturdy . The steam heat was too expensive to maintain and was not needed in our time because automobiles were no longer painted with varnish , but were sprayed with lacquer , which could stand the weather so that few were stored in the garage . We had a stove for the office area that was connected to this flue . There was also another stove , with its own flue , for the shop . In order to give twenty-four-hour service , a family member always slept at the garage . This was usually Father . When the weather was cold , he often started the fire in his stove with a section cut from a worn-out tire . This would burn rapidly and warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 28 , 1929 , was exceptionally cold , and most of our customers had not yet fortified their cars ' radiators with alcohol . Ethylene glycol was not yet popular as an antifreeze . Consequently , our storage space was jammed with cars . Father rose early and started the fire in the stove in his usual way . The red-hot stovepipe did not worry him ; it was joined to a flue presumably adequate for a large boiler . As we learned later , // this flue had been built from one course of brick and mortar , without flue lining . I saw the cloud of smoke soon after I left home , which was about six blocks away . More and more I realized that our garage was the victim . By the time I reached the scene , firemen were packing up to leave , the sidewalk was littered with broken plate glass , and Father was standing alone . I saw Father cry for only the second time . He told me years later that the next day he went to his bankers , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and proposed that they all take their loss and quit . The insurance money would cover much of the investment , and in 1929 it was better to have money than real estate . The bankers would not listen , but insisted that he plan immediately to rebuild " bigger and better than ever " in the spring . With all their presumed contacts with Eastern finance , it is hard to understand why they did not know better . Perhaps it is not so surprising . Now , people I know in Kansas seem much less pessimistic than those who speak from either coast . Builder Solomon Deines made us a fine garage , about 60 by 120 feet , with much plate glass , and a clear span across the building , provided by a bowstring trussed roof . I think it cost less than ten thousand dollars , and Deines took a new Chrysler as part payment . At the time of the fire , there were four new Model D John Deere tractors stored near the east side inside the garage . As the place burned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one at a time , out the back door . The fourth , pursued closely by the fire , became wedged inside the doorway and had to be abandoned to the flames . // Father threw up a small sheet metal building on a corner of the property , far enough from the garage site that it would not interfere with Deines 's men , and equipped it with a few power tools , an acetylene welding torch , an air regulator and a DeVilbiss paint gun . We unearthed our air compressor and found that its controls , tank and compressor unit were sound . The burned-out motor was replaced temporarily by a one-cylinder John Deere engine of one and one-half horsepower . Father and a hired man quickly drove three of the " saved " John Deere tractors to our farm and set me to repainting them with official green John Deere paint for the tractor proper and yellow for the wheels . The hoods that covered the fuel tanks were removed and repainted , and the Deere trademark , a deer bounding over a log , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which could still be seen under the green recoating . I thoroughly enjoyed the work . To farmers looking for a bargain in a tractor saved from the fire , Father made up a story and stuck to it ? the tractors had all been returned to the factory in Moline , Illinois . Somehow , I did not feel guilty in supporting this lie , as I had in being involved in Father 's substituting of Polarine engine oil for Mobil oil . I was not analytic about it . I enjoyed painting , and I gloried in remaking the Deere trademark on the hoods and redrawing the raised castiron letters on the upper tanks of the tractor radiators . Later , I marveled that farmers never seemed to notice the difference between my indifferent decorations and the ones they covered . It never occurred to me that a potential customer might realize the truth but not mention it , being reluctant to upset the delicate balance between a generous trade-in allowance on an old tractor and a too-close inspection of the " new " Model D. I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always blurt out everything he knows . With three tractors restored and ready for sale , the question of what to do with the fourth followed . The distributor block on the magneto was scorched and cracked . The fuel tank had ruptured . The radiator , which consisted of cast-iron upper and lower tanks and a gasketed and bolted-in core of tinned pipes , looked hopeless . A minor problem lay with the steering mechanism . A cast-iron segment , which engaged a worm gear on the steering shaft , had been broken when the attempt to pull the tractor from the fire had failed . Father decided to replace the magneto and fuel tank , have the radiator core remanufactured by the Clark Radiator shop at Hays , Kansas , replace the steering parts , repaint the machine and sell it as new . I took on the job without a qualm . It was harder than the earlier restorations , but not impossible . By this time I was ready to draw the deer jumping the log , almost without guidance . ( There was a heavy paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lettering that was obviously stenciled . It did not seem good to make this one machine look so different from the others . ) Father was blessed with luck . His customer for the fourth tractor was a man nearing old age , probably a grandfather whose children had flown before he was quite ready to retire completely . He bought the machine and loved it . I had slipped on only one important point . The grease retainers on the front wheels had been scorched , and I had not replaced them . Dirt worked into the wheel bearings and ruined the inner bearing cones and cups ; these and , of course , the grease retainers , had to be replaced at the end of the first season . I do not know for sure , // but I think the customer was charged full price for the repair . There , at last , I felt a measure of guilt . I had made a mistake for which I was not free to take the blame . The manufacturer was not immune to blame . We had trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearings on other Model Ds . This was due not to poor design , but to the addition of grease gun nipples to the hubs of the wheels . Conscientious owners would service these fittings , often with power-operated grease guns , persisting until grease oozed from the insides of the wheels , stretching the grease retainers and making a path for dust to penetrate to the bearing roller assemblies . In another rash of troubles , belt pulleys , which formed part of the tractor 's clutch mechanism , would become unstable and wobbly . Often , the first indication was a broken clutch driving plate , a fairly expensive part . Investigation invariably showed that a large bronze bushing , pressed inside the drive gear that had been heat shrunk onto the pulley hub , had come loose and migrated about three inches from its proper place . I repaired these by drilling small holes through the pulley hub , countersinking short machine screws into them and threading the screws into the thick bronze bearing to hold it in place . After a year or two , the tractors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place . The trouble was past . Much later , and informally , I learned what had happened . In early models , the bronze bushing had been pressed into place Inside the pulley bore before the gear was shrunk over the outside . A change in order of assembly had been made , so that the outside gear was shrunk on first and the bronze pressed into place later . Shrinking the gear onto the hub had left a slight ridge in the // pulley bore . This ridge had scraped the bronze , shavings fell inside a space where they were not obvious , and the bronze fit loosely as a result . Had I been more literate , I might have written a memo to the factory . As it was , I merely devised a way to protect our customers and kept silent . 122 Iso-Vis While farmers and merchants were going broke in the Depression , the consumer products departments of major corporations were busy inventing ways to stimulate business . One of these efforts resulted in Standard of Indiana 's new motor oil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior because it was pre-diluted . It contained low-grade distillate , similar to diesel fuel , homogenized with a lubricating oil similar to ? but , of course , superior to ? Polarine . As a result , cold weather did not cause it to thicken , and since it had already been diluted to saturation , further dilution due to over-rich carburetor adjustment or over-choking to start cold engines would simply gas off , escaping through the engine breather . The salesman , who displayed his thirty-second degree Masonic ring prominently to cement solidarity with Father , sold hard , and we , along with other garages and filling stations , kept Iso-Vis for sale , prominently displayed . Luck was not kind to the Iso-Vis program . A cold , wet and slushy winter soon resulted in accumulations of water vapor in crankcases ; the ventilation systems then in use were not adequate , and Iso-Vis turned into crankcase sludge . Iso-Vis was supposed to allow longer intervals between oil changes , but // engine damage , either from seizing of parts in newer engines or rapid oil consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners had time to consult the stickers on dashes or in door frames that warned them it was time to change the oil . One by one , Standard outlets up and down the highway rolled their Iso-Vis pumps back from the curbs and complained ? often by letter as well as through the salesman ? to each other and the company . Moreover , they refused to pay invoices for the product . I remember that Kip Disney of Ellis , a close relative of Walt Disney , spearheaded the complaints . Iso-Vis disappeared from the market , but its ghosts did not . The old designations for body , or thickness , of motor oil ( light , medium , heavy , special heavy and extra-heavy ) were replaced by specifications laid down by the Society of Automotive Engineers , and the numbers SAE 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 and 60 became the designations used in advertising and trade . Improved crankcase ventilation has been incorporated in the engines of newer cars , and more sophisticated ways of keeping oil from thickening in cold weather have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil designated 10-40 , or 10-30 , to signify that in cold weather the oil imposes little or no greater load on starters than SAE 10 , while in hot weather it " stands up " to provide adequate lubrication . Along the way , pistons of light alloy that neither collapse readily from high cylinder temperatures nor wear out prematurely were developed , and , more significantly , combinations of compression ring , scraper ring and ventilated oil control ring were brought into use to seal engine cylinders and reduce oil // consumption to near zero . For a few years , it was possible to extend the life of an engine considerably by replacing piston rings with new ones , designed for higher cylinder wall pressure and featuring expanders between the rings and the bottoms of piston grooves . These operations are still physically possible , but unless the automobile owner has the proper skill and can either tolerate grease or be delicate enough to work clean , the operation is not affordable . When one 's car begins to guzzle oil , one looks for a less-used car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company and buys new Japanese , Swedish , German , American-Mexican or American-Canadian , perhaps even presumedto-be one hundred percent American . // Part of the effort to " keep America strong " after World War I was to design and manufacture the combat vehicle known ever since as the Jeep . Not being privy to the councils that setup the Jeep project , I can still make a fair guess at what must have gone on . When shooting stopped , there was an inevitable dislocation . Workers and factories faced layoffs and corporate managers and stockholders faced shrinking business . Rescue had to be mounted , and the name of it was Keep America Strong . Defense procurement authorities saw opportunity , the Willys Overland Company saw salvation and citizens of cities in our heartland saw a soft landing from the World War I boom . The Jeep needs no defenders , and it , itself , plays only a minor role in the story I wish to tell . What I am concerned with is the way in which the Willys Overland Company , makers of Willys Knight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from war to peace . For as far back in my youth as I can remember , newspapers had carried advertisements for the Willys Knight automobile , extolling its patented double-sleeve valve engine and predicting that , at a magic year , when patents ran out , all good cars would have sleeve-valve engines . The smart buyer 126 T H E G A R A G E could have a sleeve-valve engine that " improves with use " right now , however , simply by buying from his friendly Willys dealer . The magic year came and went , and no stampede of manufacturers to the sleeve-valve idea occurred . Any mechanic who had had the oil pan off a Knight engine and had inspected the brute in earnest could have told why . Instead of a camshaft , the Knight had an extra , small crankshaft , with two tiny connecting rods for each cylinder , wrist-pinned at their upper ends to cylinder sleeves that ran at one-half main crankshaft speed and opened and closed intake ports on one side of the engine and exhaust ports on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strokes of the conventional engine ? intake , compression , power and exhaust ? would take place in proper order , once every two revolutions of the main crankshaft . Granting that it might work efficiently , such an engine obviously would be much more difficult to manufacture than the ordinary poppet-valve engine , and repair , which would eventually be necessary , would be difficult . Though Willys Overland engineers were much in evidence in the design of the Jeep , it did not have a sleeve-valve engine , but a compact , responsive , and not overly heavy engine of conservative conventional design . This engine , and a small automobile designed to use it and to sell for very little more than a Model T Ford , were designated the Whippet and placed on the market . Without the promotion and financing available to Ford , the car sold sluggishly , though the few brave buyers I ran into in my early days in the garage were well satisfied , and I was impressed with the clean design and good performance of the cars . // All this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , Willys Overland , bereft of any sales surge inspired by the advantages of their Willys Knight cars , continued to produce them . The poppet-valve , Jeep-derived Whippet kept the company in business ? just barely . Then in 1927 , potential rescue appeared . Ford shut down its factories to retool for the Model A , and the market for a replacement car was open . With better luck , Willys might have , in sports parlance , gone ahead and stayed ahead . It made a brave try , and , at the behest of Ward Marshall of Salina , the Willys distributor , and with the tolerance of Bert Breon , our Chrysler distributor , we of Mason Garage took on the Whippet-Willys-Knight franchise . What we had to sell represented a major merchandising effort on the part of the manufacturers . There was , of course , the low-priced Whippet . Then there was the Willys Six , a poppet-valveengined car to fill the **26;890;TOOLONG slot . Finally , we had a newly designed Willys Knight Six , made to offer modest luxury and performance-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . We received Whippets in freight-car loads , six to a car , and sold them readily . Willys Six and Willys Knight Six were driven out from Salina and placed on display . They , like any higherpriced car , sold much more slowly . All cars were priced to the dealer without bumpers so that these necessary appendages could serve as bargaining chips between buyer and dealer , as could the spare tire , which was also an extra-price option . Every buyer , of course , got bumpers and a spare tire , but a canny buyer without a trade-in and with cash could get them free . Poorer or less wily buyers paid for bumpers , spare tire or both . Financing was done , I think , by the Commercial Credit Corporation , and once the proper references // were given and the proper papers were signed , the dealer went gleefully to the bank to pay wholesale cost plus freight and to put what he regarded as profit into the account that never seemed to contain enough to cover the overhead . Much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Transmission grease , engine oil , a few gallons of gasoline , initial adjustments of brakes and a three-hundred-mile tune-up were included in the service , and we , as dealers , exerted ourselves to keep customers happy ? and not inclined to regard their purchases as lemons . This was possible in most cases . The production cars did embody good design , but the production for 1927 and following years showed poor quality control in manufacturing . The timing chains on later Whippets , which on the older models gave little trouble , would promptly become loose , ticking and tinkling on the chain covers and needing not just one adjustment , but repeated ones . Some chains wore through the thin covers , so that chain , sprockets and cover all had to be replaced early on . The power handling engine parts usually stood up well , but when one had to remove the cylinder head for any reason , he was likely to find lathe marks on cylinder walls and , in a few cases , in both the Whippet and the Willys Six , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same virgin engine . Moreover the brakes , activated by rods open to the Kansas mud , tended to work poorly and be hard to equalize between sides of the car , and Whippet brake drums were often so much off center and out-of-round that a typical stop could be a distinct wriggle , followed by a lopsided squat . In redesigning the Knight engine with six instead of four cylinders , the engineers encountered troubles that were not // eliminated in pre-production tests . At the garage , we were accustomed to find vibration in engines to be caused by poorly balanced parts , installed at overhauls . Here , in brand-new engines , there was inevitably a very noticeable up-and-down vibration that occurred when the car passed from about twenty miles per hour to higher speeds in high gear . The cause was not unbalanced parts , but unfortunate harmonics resulting from the change from four to six cylinders . Ordinarily , a six is more stable than a four , but , in these sixes , there were so many uppings and downings of reciprocating parts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result . For conservative buyers , a demonstrating salesman could usually accelerate the car past the critical engine period before shifting into high , and the buyer , often as not , found nothing amiss . Nevertheless , the bobbing up and down tended to prevent the development of the sort of man-and-machine relationship that could build owner enthusiasm . Furthermore , Silichrome steel exhaust valves , and later , hardened valve seats and , still later , hydraulic valve lifters , removed the faults in poppet valve engines that had made the Knight a possible alternative in the first place . By the time the " patents had run out " on the Knight engine , protecting it from patent infringement had become moot . We did not have to fight the battle of the Whippet revival for long . In 1928 the Model A Ford hit the roads , and only a few uncomfortable souls could be content with a Whippet . We did not sell Willys Overland products after the new garage was built following our fire . Chrysler brought out a Six , priced at about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . One we took for a family car carried Mary and me // for a vacation with the Methodist preacher 's large family to the Colorado Rockies near Longs Peak and Estes Park . We were gone about two weeks , traveling most days . En route I repaired the preacher 's Dodge Victory Six , which had been recently overhauled at a competitor 's good shop and , which , surprisingly , tied up the shaft that held its ignition unit and also drove the oil pump . Probably the engine bearings leaked less oil , and the vertical shaft did not get its usual lubrication . At any rate , we put the car up on a couple of rocks , took off the pan , got the seized bearing loosened up and welded the twisted-off drive finger for the oil pump . By extreme good fortune , the filling station in Burlington , Colorado , behind which we blocked up the Victory Six , had a proper distributor cap to replace the one that had been shattered when the ignition unit had turned suddenly as its shaft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hours . I was a hero and tried to be modest about it . As the reward for my work , the musically sensitive preacher 's young remained quiet throughout the whole trip , while I rent the air with my tenor banjo and mournful singing of popular songs around campfires . We almost reached WaKeeney without incident on the return trip . About three miles south of town , the Chrysler Six 's spare tire gave out and we had to telephone the garage to send out rescue ? or perhaps the preacher 's car went on in and alerted the mechanics at the garage . As I remember it , the Chrysler Six never really recovered . It had started using oil , the brakes were shot , and , at about twenty thousand miles , its days of glory were over . Chrysler did make a good car in the **28;918;TOOLONG class in 1930 or 1931 . We sold one to Claude Hardman , WaKeeney 's leading lumber dealer and grain elevator owner . It // was a straight eight , and it featured one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone lineman friend told us of one he had seen that had rolled several times on the way off a road fill , was righted and driven away , not very much beaten up . The car we sold Hardman had one glitch , however , caused by faulty design , and cheerfully corrected by the factory ? provided the dealer installed the necessary parts . The original design had aligned the drive shaft with the rear axle unit so that the rear universal joint was almost in a bind . The drive pinion slanted upward too much . After we had replaced the universal joint a time or two , a small package , containing two shingle-shaped steel shims , arrived from Chrysler . All we had to do was to block the car up , unbolt the long U-bolts that held rear springs to axle , insert the shims , which corrected the pinion shaft alignment with the car loaded , and reassemble everything . With air-driven wrenches used in present-day shops , it would have been a cinch , but in WaKeeney , it was a half-day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // It must have been in July 1927 , that Cale Bingham died . He had been an uncomfortable youngster throughout my gradeschool years , and in high school puberty only increased his problems . I , myself , was not well adapted to sports and thus somewhat cut off from male activities , but I had managed to go my own way , avoiding contact sports , trying all the distances short of a mile in track and being tolerated at practice and in the locker room . Bingham had not been so fortunate . On the senior sneak day in spring 1927 , he was taken along by a group of boys to swim in a deep pond on Big Creek , in a pasture . A Buick sedan had been backed up to the pond bank , and the boys had climbed to its roof and dived into the water . When Bingham 's turn came , he must have been near paralysis with fright , because he merely collapsed headfirst into the water , striking much too close to the bank , with a force that broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay at home , conscious only part of the time , requiring constant attention until July , when , his male classmates acting as pallbearers , he was buried . It was my second contact within a year with death of an acquaintance . Paul Clem 's death had occurred earlier , and left me the responsibilities of the Mason Garage Shop . Father had hired another mechanic , a second LIFE ON THE DRY LINE generation son of a Czech immigrant family , who was regarded as a man of mystery in WaKeeney because he had worked in Wichita as a production mechanic in an aircraft factory . When I returned from Bingham 's funeral , our mechanic was standing near a venerable Cadillac , stalled near the gasoline pump at the curb in front of the garage . Our mechanic looked puzzled , and he was . The Cadillac had stopped , filled its tank with gasoline and refused to start . There was spark , there was gasoline in the carburetor , the starter cranked vigorously , sometimes there was a faint whiff of smoke , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made rough checks of ignition timing and valve timing , and both were far enough from right to excuse the iron horse for balking . The engine was out of time at the camshaft , and the next thing to do was to get access to the timing chain and gears . This our mechanic could do , and sure enough , he found the short timing chain and sprockets worn out , with the timing marks on crankshaft and camshaft sprockets far from their proper alignment . We would have to order parts from Kansas City , and the Cadillac owner and his family would have to stay at the comfortable Staatz Hotel , across the alley from the garage . Getting to know the owner of the ailing Cadillac is one of the experiences that makes me happy that I did not , like some of my classmates in high school , go immediately to college . Doctor Coil , the Cadillac owner , was a surgeon , on vacation with his wife and son from a practice in Mexico , Missouri , about a hundred miles east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world in general was one of confident acceptance . He and his family would be quite comfortable , he said . They were on // vacation , and WaKeeney would be the place to spend part of it . His wife and son would be content to read , sitting under trees in our Court House Park ; they liked the food at the Staatz Hotel . He , himself , would be reasonably content , but ? was there any place near to go fishing ? Father , not a fisherman , knew the places where fish were caught , and he arranged for me to take Doctor Coil to one of them , a deep pool in a creek that ran into the Saline River about ten miles north of town . We would go in our Packard touring car , and when Doctor Coil saw my brother , then about eight years old , standing by wistfully , he promptly included him In the party . I drove through a pasture to stop the car near the pond . We assembled bamboo poles , lines , cork bobbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to our tackle . The evening light faded , and brother Howard began to be restless . Doctor Coil gathered Howard into his lap and started telling him stories . I put tackle into the car , started the engine and attempted to drive up the road that led to the pond . It was no use . We were hopelessly stuck . The eighteen-year-old who could diagnose a slipped timing chain had not had sense enough to park on solid ground . It was not far to a farm house ; I called Father , and he came and brought us home . Through all this , I heard not one word of reproach from either Doctor Coil or Father . Reality was punishment enough . Our mechanic , faced with a straightforward assembly job , fixed the Cadillac quickly , and it ran smoothly . Later we received a postcard from Doctor Coil , from a mountain town in Colorado , reporting that the car " runs like a rubber-tired buggy . " // To deliver smaller farm machines to customers , and to transport me , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on rare " dates " and on troubleshooting trips to the countryside , we used automobiles and light trucks that had come to us in trade , often as down payment for new machines . Two of these exemplified what might have been called the Mason Fleet . One was a 1923 Packard Six touring car , the other a Haynes Six of about the same year model . Both served for several years . We probably acquired the Packard sometime in 1927 . That was the time when the Union Pacific Highway was being graded up to a level above the surrounding countryside by a thennew type of grader , which scooped out deep and wide gutters on each side of the roadway , throwing the yellow clay that underlay the loam that , thirty years earlier , had supported prairie . The plan was to coat this new surface with gravel , which would be moved back and forth across the roadway to maintain an all-weather surface . Sandy gravel was obtained from washes near creeks and hauled to the new roadway in fleets of Model T Ford trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortened so that an auxiliary transmission , called a Warford Tee , could be inserted // behind the regular Ford engine-and-transmission unit to provide increased torque . The drivers of these trucks formed loose crews of individual entrepreneurs and were paid by the cubic yard of material delivered . Such an arrangement freed the road contractors from the need to own fleets of trucks and , more important , from the expensive and frustrating task of keeping the trucks on the job . The owner-drivers , optimistic young men , would haul gravel for four or five days , then bring the trucks to the garage to have the connecting rods adjusted over the weekend . I grew accustomed to spending weekends looking at the lower ends of Model T engines . The older engines had short pans that gave easy access to the first three connecting rod bearings . The fourth rod could be adjusted , but required a special wrench , and offered opportunity to drop bearing nuts into the oil pan . To recover them then , you had to remove the entire engine . ( The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the fourth rod got a better chance at lubrication in engines frequently allowed to run short of oil or subjected to long uphill pulls , the fourth rod tended to need less adjustment , and mechanics often neglected it . One reason our garage got gravel truck business was that , being country yokels driven by conscience , we always adjusted all four bearings . This was good for business and conscience , but it was hard on knuckles . Travelers , as well as gravel truck operators , tended to be optimistic . As the number of all-weather miles grew larger , more and more motorists would start from Kansas City , assured of about two hundred miles of smooth riding and hoping for good weather beyond Hays or Ellis , Kansas . When their luck played out , they were likely to store their cars in our garage and take the // train , either back East , or on to Denver , picking the car up on the return journey . If the car was of marginal value , they might simply leave it garaged and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners of a Packard Six . Having stored it for a year , then advertised it in the local newspaper , Father could sell it to himself , at auction , and thus have legal title . Clem , our mechanic , looked it over and pronounced it worth rehabilitation . He had persuaded Father to buy paintspraying and body-bumping tools , and the Packard got a thorough restoration . In Plains Gray Acme Proxlyn , a lacquer competitor of Dupont Duco , it was made to shine . A few months later it became an early beneficiary of our new Storm Reboring Bar and the small lathe with which Clem turned pistons down to size . His finish on pistons was far from high polish , but they wore well when broken in discreetly . The Packard became a moving advertisement , and I , as a high school junior and senior , was eager to drive it here and there , often with several of my male friends and their dates in the rear . The body of the five-passenger Six was identical to that of the seven-passenger model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that young bodies had ample room to intertwine , in patterns I , as driver , was only dimly aware of . Another attractive feature of the car was that the exhaust pipe could be sprung down from the manifold and pushed to the side , so that either a quiet or a noisy car was available with a minor adjustment . Generally speaking , the Packard was designed conservatively . It had two features , however , that were not to be passed on to later generations . The first of these was the fuelizer . The carburetor had a small chamber , interconnected with the ex- // haust manifold , in which a small amount of gas-air mixture and warm exhaust was exposed to a special spark plug , activated by the ungrounded end of the engine 's ignition coil . The idea was to provide a small warm stream of burning fuel to blend with the output of the carburetor proper and thus make the engine run more smoothly at speeds just above idling . It was possible to adjust the device so that it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few miles , the special spark plug would foul with carbon , and whatever input came from the Fuelizer was only a poorly mixed addition to what the regular part of the carburetor furnished . Like most of those who " owned one " we soon cut off the fuel supply for the fuelizer , and lived happily with the result . The car would run seventy-five miles per hour on the level , or even slightly uphill , and at any sensible speed on the roads we had , it would go fifteen miles on a gallon of gasoline ? a fair compromise between the customer and Standard Oil of Indiana . The second special feature of this model Packard was the clutch . Unlike those in later-model cars , it was of the multipleplate dry type . ( The Hudson at this time employed a multipleplate wet clutch . ) The idea behind the elaborate engineering Involved in these units seemed to be to make the effort of depressing the clutch pedal as slight as possible . With many surfaces to carry the engine 's power to the transmission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leverage required at the pedal could be much less . Probably this was an engineering attempt to encourage women to drive cars , they being considered weak frivolous creatures by engineers and salesmen . When a car was new , the multiple-plate clutches worked very well , though they made the cost of the vehicles considerably greater . It was to // be a few years before cost , in nickels and dimes , would be of great importance to designers . As a car aged , the splined spiders on which the several clutch plates moved became notched in the plane of the plates so that , when engaged , the plates rode into the wear notches and had to be hoisted out of these grooves when the clutch was released to shift gears . There were many of these grooves , and , short of installing new spiders when a clutch was relined , there was little that could be done to make the units work better once groove wear had occurred . There was a way , however , to improve matters . The thickness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point where a few plates had to be discarded , whereupon a new set of unworn surfaces on the splines of the spiders could be exposed to wear . The message to me from this clutch was , make it simple . In most matters , Packard had done this , but I found , in servicing later models , that their engineers were prone to carry along at least one untested innovation in each major model change . The most disastrous of these was the Skinner Oil Rectifier . This device used intake manifold vacuum to suck off excess oil from the lower parts of the piston skirts as they came to the end of their strokes , carry this oil up to a stove resting on the exhaust manifold , and there redistill the oil , ridding it of dilution from the over-rich mixtures of fuel needed for starting cold engines . As a mechanic , our man Clem thought , and I agreed , that the engineers viewed the rectifier as a way to control engine oil consumption . It would be a few years before arrays of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinder lubrication and low oil consumption could be achieved , aided by better // ways to ventilate crankcases and reduce vapor pressure at the bottoms of cylinders . At any rate , the Skinner device did not work well . The first announcement of its failure was likely to be a stuck piston , where too much lubrication had been sucked away , leaving a dry area where piston and cylinder rapidly reached welding temperature . The mechanic 's cure was to cut off suction to the rectifier . The rectifier found better use on the Willys Knight Six , which employed two moving sleeves , instead of poppet valves , to move gas mixture and exhaust through each cylinder . With so many surfaces to be oiled and to waste oil , it became worthwhile to work out the fine points ? to adapt the device to the engine . By the time we acquired the Haynes , its manufacture had probably been discontinued . It had been towed into the garage next door , the one under the hotel , and was considered a basket case . Clem often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was attracted to the Haynes as something he could repair , and that , as he thought , Staatz could not . The huge six-cylinder engine , with three and five-eighths inch bore and five inch stroke , was larger than the Packard Six engine and thus somewhat more powerful . Clem could patch the crankcase with sheet metal and gaskets and have a powerful chassis on which a box could be mounted to make it into a tonand-a-half truck . The particular attraction the job held for Clem was that it would give him a chance to show off the Storm Reboring Bar . As I remember it , Clem traded Staatz a good-looking Ford Model A roadster for the Haynes . Father was not amused but did // not want to scold Clem . Staatz promptly decorated the Model A , and paraded it around , doubtless telling people he had bested Clem . Clem went about reviving the Haynes . He ordered a smooth sleeve , about five-sixteenths of an inch thick , from the Lee Hardware Company , straightened out a damaged connecting rod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running and had it rebabbited by the Watkins Company in Wichita . Everything went as planned . The block was bored out , and the sleeve , coated with white lead , pulled into place without incident . The hole in the crankcase was repaired easily , and the body of the car , behind the dash , was taken off and scrapped . Father , who prided himself on construction of wagon boxes , bound oak timbers around the frame to serve as bolsters for a truck bed . Here it was necessary to guess how much the rear springs would settle when the truck was loaded . Clem left the construction of the truck bed and the seat for the driver up to Father and me . I thought the floor of the truck box should slope toward the front , remembering with pain an incident in which I had started from a farm to town with a small pile of grain in an old truck and arrived without any of the grain , the rear endgate having sprung open , and the grain jolted toward the back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was canted smartly up at the rear , and the front endgate slanted up over the seat cushion on which the driver was to sit . We had a second mechanic named Bill Herr , who drove the truck for us , a tall man who had no trouble reaching the pedals or steering wheel , but who had to assume a forward stoop in order to sit behind the wheel . We used the Haynes for a long time . It seemed to work effortlessly , and since we had never connected the speedometer , Herr was prone to underestimate its // speed . On one occasion , he took a piece of John Deere equipment to the dealer in Quinter , twenty miles away , unloaded it , loaded up a large grain drill and returned to our garage in just an hour . We could only guess at his average road speed , but it must have exceeded sixty miles an hour . Herr was probably happy not to sit on that seat any longer than necessary , but he said he did n't hurry ; he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reinforcing truck boxes . During the time that the Union Pacific Highway was being graveled , he took on the dealership for Stewart trucks . A young fellow had bought one to use in hauling gravel , and seemed to like it , except that he was disturbed when the cab shifted on the frame as he brought loads of gravel up at an angle from the road gutter to the top of the grade . Father said he thought he could cure the trouble . He went to the lumber yard , got a long piece of four-by-six-inch oak and had his blacksmith friend make bolts with which to clamp it to the frame . Only one load was required to demonstrate that the truck designers had anticipated some squirming of the frame as wheels came up over obstructions , one at a time . There were two holes , a bit larger than four by six inches , in the cab of the truck , where the timber had obeyed the laws of physics once to the right , once to left , as the truck angled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its first load of gravel . // THE GOLDEN BELT Until the autumn of 1925 , when we became garagemen , I had been only dimly aware of bright yellow bands , painted at chest height , on the poles that supported telephone lines running between the towns that owed their existence to the Kansas City-to-Denver line of the Union Pacific Railroad . In fact , by 1925 , these bright yellow bands were fading . They were the work of the ; olden Belt Association , a confederation of Commercial Clubs , forerunners of Chambers of Commerce , organized to promote business interests in towns such as Russell , Gorham , Hays , Ellis , WaKeeney and on through Oakley to Sharon Springs , Kansas , and the Colorado line . There were no doubt lobbies to urge the Kansas legislature to make money available to build a through highway . This came about by fits and starts which I 'm not equipped to chronicle in detail . It would have been strange , however , if the move for an all-weather highway did not encounter resistance . Trucks were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still regarded as profitable , and the financiers who had promoted railroads and the settlement of the area they ran through had long ago lost interest in railroad operations . They had , however , been granted a broad right-of- // way for their tracks and associated telegraph and signal lines , and giving up a portion of it for a highway was nothing to be rushed into . The advantages to a highway of following the rail route were great . The line had been laid out to avoid steep grades and long fills , at great expense and after many controversies . Towns on the railroad prospered ; those far from it faded . When we went into the garage business , the Golden Belt Association was in decline , and a new effort was made in the name of the Union Pacific Highway . Significantly , the white bands on roadside poles that replaced the fading yellow ones were on the roadside nearest the railroad and , I think , on the telegraph and signal poles within the railroad right-of-way . Again I defer to historians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what the state gave , it could also take away ; the railroad must not only permit painting on its poles , it must do the much more expensive job of protecting grade crossings with signals and , in congested areas , with crossing gates . It would be many years before Interstate 70 straightened the highway , detoured the less prosperous towns along the railroad and aligned itself to avoid , rather than run through , the main streets of the others . // The rail distance between Kansas City , Missouri , and Denver , Colorado , via the Kansas Pacific segment of the Union Pacific System , is 640 miles . WaKeeney , Kansas , is the town nearest the middle of this distance ? the distances to terminal points of the rail line , marked on the east and west ends of the WaKeeney depot , were 321 miles and 319 miles , respectively . Thus , our garage business was positioned well to provide overnight storage and emergency repairs for the well-heeled citizens who drove their city-used Packard Straight Eights from Kansas City or points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the long-distance tourists stayed at Staatz 's hotel . The highway ran up Russell Avenue , directly in front of both the hotel and the garage . Our garage 's chief claim to prestige was its being the Chrysler Agency , only a year after the Chrysler Six was introduced to begin the battle to replace the mid-priced Buick as the way for prosperous businessmen and farmers to show that they could afford something more expensive than the Model T Ford . Dealing in new and used cars was far from the day-to-day occupation at the garage , however . Selling and installing exhaust manifold heaters on Model T Fords gave us some business . Starting tourists ' cars that had made the run from Kansas City but // THE GARAGE refused to start after a night on the street kept us alert to the new developments in the industry . Ignition points that had built up a knob on one side and a crater on the other would fire the spark plugs when the engine was hot but often would not start a cold engine . Many car models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles at what are now moderate road speeds . Vacuum tanks , used to entice gasoline from the rear tank to a position above the carburetor , depended upon an engine working at considerably less than full throttle . When the road had been straightened enough to allow sustained operation at road speed without slowing down for railroad crossings or sharp turns , power might cut off , only to return when the driver released the throttle , restoring intake manifold vacuum and thus coaxing more gasoline from the rear tank . Many cars , particularly the impressive Packard Straight Eights , were not designed to stay cool in hot weather when driven more than a hundred miles or so . Replacing fan belts was a common task , but fatherly advice to stop frequently and enjoy the view might have been more effective . Eventually , the Kansas Highway Commission provided an incentive to stop and read bits of Kansas history , but this was not until sometime in the late 1920s or the 1930s . To folk who did not consider a park planted with trees and shrubs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would induce them to tarry between Ellsworth , Kansas , and Denver , Colorado , if their equipment would continue to function . We learned about regional accents , family dynamics , roadside diplomacy and the workings-out of the automotive industry 's long-running experiments in which customers , rather than racing or proving grounds , provided answers to problems . // Much of the junior mechanic 's working time was spent looking at the lower connecting rod bearings of Model T Fords , removing the bearing caps one at a time , filing the mating surfaces a given number of strokes with a mill file , replacing and tightening the caps , checking for proper fit and repeating the process . When too much stock was removed , thin brass or paper shims could be cut and placed on the bolts that held the bearing together . As in all crafts , speed and accuracy in the work depended upon the ability to make good initial guesses . Another frequent job was to adjust the transmission bands of the Model T. This was rather easy , but replacing bands that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one top lug that could be released ? so that the band could be pulled out , relined and reinserted ? soon appeared . In the bad old days , it had been necessary to remove the whole transmission cover to remove bands . When using the new-style bands that Ford soon adopted one had only to remove a nut and washer from the extension of each of the three pedals and place them safely away from the opening in the transmission case . Older mechanics usually stuffed rags down beside the drums to catch any part that might be dropped , either in running the nut off the pedal stub or replacing it once the relined band had been inserted and teased around into place . Younger men , of which I was one , bravely held on to the parts and did n't drop them . If one was dropped , it fell to the bottom of the oil sump , and after one attempted to retrieve it with a magnet at the end of a special tool , he usually removed the engine from the car , talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that the engine was out " and tied up the car for a few days . I do n't think I ever dropped // a transmission band nut or washer , but I remember gritting my teeth in the effort to avoid doing it . Far more time was spent putting on and taking off tire chains than in making mechanical adjustments to the cars themselves . If rain fell on Friday night , farmers would install tire chains at home , drive to town for Saturday shopping and , as often happened , find that roads had dried up before late afternoon . Then they might drive around to the garage to have the chains removed , washed and put in the backseat area of the car . The reverse of this often happened also ; coming to town dry , the farmer would see rain in midafternoon and would drive around to have chains installed for the trip home . Often he would need a new set of chains ? a matter of six or eight dollars . One brand of tire chains dominated the market ? Weed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just over fifty miles long , cheerfully bought a new set of chains every four trips . Kansas was a dry state and WaKeeney was near the driest part , yet some February-toMay periods would see rain almost every day , and our drayman would dump off piles of bagged tire chains from Lee Hardware Company in Salina three or four times a week . I learned to put on chains so they would not come off ; what was more important to me , I learned how it felt to be uncomfortable at work . Cold concrete , wet or dry , soon chilled my right shoulder and hip , and there might be little respite for an hour or two . It came as a welcome revelation that , after the first pair of chains , nothing hurt , and there was a fierce joy in being on top of the job . // Go COURTING Through 1925 and well into 1927 , the Union Pacific Highway wriggled westward across Kansas in projects of ten to twenty miles ' length . Travelers became accustomed to driving on completed segments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally to their destinations . Along the way , as the road materialized mile by mile , there were opportunities to observe the behavior of men at work , the capabilities and weaknesses of machines and the layered structure of the soil , down to a depth of three feet or more , as powerful grading equipment buried the Kansas loam under a foot to a yard of the subsoil that had been holding it up . The subsoil varied from place to place , but particularly in the western part of Trego County , it was a yellow clay , dusty when dry and unbelievably sticky when wet . I have written of the exertions of the gravel trucks . The off-duty behavior of truck drivers occurred outside my ken , though absences due to hangovers and banter among drivers bringing in trucks for repair suggested that life on the job was far from serene . I did get to learn something of the way in which the // roadbuilding affected the social behavior of the young . For what seemed to be an eternity , the highway west from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravel . The dances WaKeeney youth attended took place at Voda , seven miles west , or at Collyer , seven miles beyond Voda . None of what follows would have happened if WaKeeney 's Presbyterians had remained content with their old church . They were the upper crust of local society , however , and they decided to build a fine new church . Their architect recommended Justus and Sons as builders , and the elder Justus , with his two sons , moved into rented rooms and , over a year or more , put up an impressive building . Justus ' sons were husky , good-natured and skillful ; they were at home with brick , stone or wood . They were also single and lonely . On a Saturday night in the springtime , they got their Durant out of the garage and , dressed in their finest clothes , escorted Mrs. Bell 's daughters to a dance at Collyer . Sometime around midnight , I , who was taking my turn sleeping at the garage to provide twenty-four-hour service , was roused by young men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakened . I drifted back to sleep . Later , at perhaps two o'clock , more mature messengers roused me , not being content merely to deliver a message , they made sure that I got out of bed , stood up and heard clearly that the Justus boys and their dates were stranded , their car not running , about six miles west of town , far from the nearest phone . We had a 1922 Dodge touring car that we used as a mud car . We kept heavy-duty tire chains on it ; the rear fenders had long since been worn and torn away . There was no top . On the floor beside the front seat , we kept an assortment of spades , // shovels and leaves from automobile springs with which to deal with mud . I got into my rubber boots , put on a slicker and rain hat and started west . Rain was falling steadily , and the Dodge , its chains clanking , carried me without incident to the defunct Durant and its occupants . The four young got into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard from further . A sincere effort had been made to return the Bell sisters to their mother promptly , and , if they did not turn up pregnant in due course , their reputations were saved . I was , of course , only an honest broker in these affairs . No sooner had I turned the Dodge toward WaKeeney than the rain stopped . Within half a mile , the Dodge 's right front wheel had grown to the diameter of a wash tub , with sticky clay mud fouling the space between wheel and chassis until the car could not be steered and would not proceed in high gear . The Dodge then threatened to stall in second gear and finally was immobile even in low , which had a reputation for being unstoppable . I got out and dug with a spade with spring leaves and with my hands until the wheels ? the right front was only the worst of four ? would roll . We proceeded through first gear , second and perhaps a short way in high , then the wheels fouled . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again . No calls for help , no protests and no offers of help came from under the blanket over the back seat area . I assumed that all was satisfactory . We arrived at the Bell residence , on WaKeeney 's paved streets , in time to see good Christians getting into their cars to go to church . The girls were home , the Justus boys were on the porch to explain , the Dodge was soon on the wash rack , awaiting the high pressure hose and I was on the way home for // breakfast . One of the Justus boys may have married one of the Bell girls , but there was certainly no hurry . The Presbyterian church was completed . Local builders waited in vain for it to show some structural weakness . Years later , there was not the slightest crack in the plaster nor gap in the mortar between bricks . // It must have been the fall rainy season of 1928 . Paul Clem had converted the Packard touring car to a wrecker to replace the aging Dodge mud car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for spades and other tools where the backseat had been . Clem had soon died and left me , at twenty , in charge of mechanical work and road service . The highway west to Collyer and beyond had been graveled , the Warford Tee modified Model T trucks that had hauled gravel were gone . On a summer afternoon after a rain , we received a call to tow a car up onto the highway grade . It had veered across the road to the left shoulder , the south one , since it was headed west , at a high culvert and draw , near the Round Barn . This barn , which was also south of the road on the west side of the draw , was a landmark . The huge structure testified to its owner 's identification with farming and , as I was to learn , his love of draft horses . The distressed automobile was deep green in color , an open roadster of a foreign make . I was too much taken up with getting it back onto the road to be curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Attempts to back it onto the road had left its rear wheels free of the ground , its ample belly firmly wedded to the mud . It looked like an ideal job for the I-beam crane , and // I soon got a chain from the crane beam to the rear axle of the car , placing the wrecker as far over the road shoulder as possible without risking the possibility that the wrecker might join the unfortunate green monster on the sticky clay slope . It was , I recognized , the same stuff that , a year or more earlier , had trapped the young Justus men and their Saturday night dates . It took only a few minutes to prove that the Packard could not free the car and restore it to the road . The driver and passenger joined me in the wrecker , and we went back to WaKeeney . One of the men was tall , large-framed and thin ; the other was shorter and a bit more plump but not obese . Both were of middle age , and both spoke with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , not cheerful , but seemed to take trouble in stride and regard whatever happened as an unfolding life in which eventual success was taken for granted . The next day we labored mightily , and a considerable gallery of farmers gathered . The sun warmed the scene . Father dug mud from in front of the mired car and caused the only protest from its owners . He was about to bang the edge of his spade against the car 's front bumper when one of the owners shouted , " Oh , please ! It looks awful now , but it 's a beautiful car . Do n't bash it . " Father was squelched . Gradually , a plan for rescuing the car emerged among the onlookers . Chains , cables and ropes , perhaps a hundred feet in length , were strung from the front axle of the car , out across the wide gully bridged by the culvert and tied to a strong pier that supported the culvert on its west side . When several men spaced themselves along this cable and pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not far enough to free it , but enough to show that it could be sprung // from its muddy bed . Father had disappeared . Soon I saw him on the west side of the draw near the Round Barn . With him was a young farmer and a four-horse team , trailing doubletrees and a connecting beam . Hands untied the long cable from its anchor on the culvert pier and attached it to the horses ' pulling beam . The farmer spoke to the team , and the green car moved gently down the slope , across the draw and up on the other side . The owners of the car approached Father to pay him , but he refused pay , introducing them to the driver of the team instead . In explanation , all Father would say was , " He helped you . We could n't . " The owners did get to pay us a small amount , however . The car 's wheels , fouled with mud , caused a severe vibration and , after driving slowly back to the garage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who alternated between being the mature garage owner and the man with the spade , got to know the owners much better than I. He told me that they were en route to California , where they would be engaged in composing and producing a musical show . I have wondered since if they might have been Rodgers and Hammerstein , Jerome Kern and someone else or Rodgers and Hart . Apparently the show they were incubating could benefit from the experience of crossing the country by car , learning the rural culture firsthand . Whatever the case , what they experienced near WaKeeney would not have inspired Surrey with the Fringe on Top . // As Kansas highways became straighter and smoother , the " big " cars began to starve their engines for gasoline , even when there was nothing wrong with them mechanically . Fords , Model T or Model A , did not have this trouble . The difference was that , in the Fords , the fuel tanks were higher than the carburetors , so fuel could run downhill all the way until the tanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were one or two much-touted exceptions . When a Model T was low on gas and a steep hill had to be climbed , it was sometimes necessary to back up the hill to keep the fuel in the tank running downhill . ) The cars other than Fords , in the 1920s , had their fuel tanks at the rear , and fuel was sucked into a dash-mounted vacuum tank by the reduced air pressure in the engine 's intake manifold . As long as roads were crooked and rough , livestock had to be avoided frequently , and city traffic required frequent stops , the vacuum tanks were adequate ; but when the roads were straightened and smoothed and major highways were fenced , high-speed travel , requiring constant high-power output , was possible , intake manifold vacuum became marginal or disappeared , and there was no force to bring the fuel forward from the rear tank . After the quart of fuel provided by the vacuum tank 's lower chamber was exhausted , the car sputtered and started to L I F E O N T H E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver eased up on the accelerator , it might " catch " as fuel was again drawn from the rear tank , only to die again shortly after highway speed was resumed . Motorists and garagemen had to suffer from this trouble until about 1926 or 1927 , when engines were equipped with camshaft-operated fuel pumps . Then better highway performance opened the way to problems with engine valves and bearings and cooling system deficiencies . The automobile industry seems never to escape the increasing demands better roads allow drivers to impose on machines . // The good times at the garage were sandwiched between 1925 and 1930 . When Father took on the agency for John Deere farm machinery , in 1927 or 1928 , the Deere salesman 's pitch centered on the Model D tractor , a much reworked version of one of the early successful medium-sized farm tractors , the Waterloo Boy . Neither the Waterloo Boy nor the Model D had the twocylinder market to itself , however . The Rumley Oil-Pull and the I fart-Parr were competitors . The Rumley used a smaller version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featured a smokestack-like exhaust , and I think it used kerosene as a coolant as well as a fuel . It never achieved wide popularity in our area , though we did trade for one . Hart-Parr machines were likewise not popular , though their Kansas City distributor sold them aggressively . At one point Father accepted the advertising literature for them , but he did not stock the tractors or parts for them . Though a good machine , the Hart-Parr had a clumsy appearance , and I was happy not to be a Hart-Parr mechanic , though I was once pressed into service as one . A Czech immigrant community with its first-generation offspring was centered around Voda . In general , they were prosperous , friendly and able to speak English without more // accent than any of us . Many of them were good mechanics , and their farmsteads were usually better-kept , more often painted and more likely to have vegetable gardens than most . It was from one of these farms that I received a call to help a group of farmers who had overhauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start . When I reached the farmyard where they were working , they had belted the Hart-Parr up to a John Deere so that it could be cranked by belt-power instead of muscle , and they were in process of disengaging the camshaft timing gear to check whether or not it was engaged to the crankshaft according to marks usually placed on these gears . As I remember it , there were no such marks , but it is fairly simple to determine correct meshing of the gears . The rule is that , when one of the cylinders has both valves closed at the top of its compression stroke , the other cylinder , turning on until it is at top-center , should have both valves barely open ? the intake opening and the exhaust closing . This verified , it was apparent that valve timing was not the cause of the trouble . With the gearing buttoned up , the men turned the engine by hand until I could check this out and also determine that the magneto delivered a good spark to the cylinder that was ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the priming cups on the Hart-Parr ? a feature it shared with the John Deere ? and proceeded to crank away by belt power . The first thing I noticed was that , while the priming cups hissed as the pistons traveled up and down ( actually back and forth ) in the cylinders , they seemed only to gasp , not to draw in a full charge on the intake stroke and expel it with vigor on the following compression stroke . Pondering this , I noticed just one gasket // profile that did not look quite like a factory job . I asked whether any of the gaskets had been handmade . I hesitated to ask any questions about the work that had been done , because it all bore the mark of expert and careful attention . There were no ragged edges . But one gasket had been handmade from a thick heatresistant material . It was between the case that held the valverocker arms and the cylinder head ; its outer lower surfaces kept the rocker-arm case from leaking oil . Exhaust flanges sprouted from each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exhaust manifold . The carburetor did not connect to this gasket , but was nearly twelve inches directly behind it , on the rocker-arm case . Seized by inspiration , I disconnected the air cleaner and put the palm of my hand at the intake of the carburetor . When the engine was cranked , there was no suction . It was apparent , though it could not be seen , that the homemade gasket should have had a hole centered between the two holes to handle exhaust . This had not been made . It was a small matter to remove one of the long valve push rods , which had large ball-like ends , and jam it through where the hole should have been cut . With good luck , the mating surfaces would hold , and the gasket would not be ruined . When a breathing hole for the carburetor had thus been made and parts replaced , the Hart-Parr burst into song , and all of us were ready to weep for happiness . I did not question the men as to whether one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the one-hole-short gasket . I cautioned them that they must disassemble the parts held apart by the gasket and make a clean , full-sized hole . This was scarcely necessary ? they knew their business well enough . What I have wondered about in later years is whether or not the man who cut the gasket also knew // what he was doing and was , in fact , pulling the mechanic 's equivalent of the summer camp trick of looping up the top sheet of a tenderfoot 's bed ( short sheeting ) ? making a shallow sack where a through bore is needed . When the men offered to pay , I suggested they wait for a bill from my father , and I 'm sure he would not have sent one . 162 T H E G R O U N D F L O O R In the 1930s , the world was between wars , and the Depression and dust storms had come to Kansas . Magazines such as Popular Mechanics began inviting untutored young males to " get in on the ground floor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airplane , powered by a four-cylinder Henderson motorcycle engine that would carry him aloft . He had named the airplane the Heath Parasol and set up a company that sold plans and kits with which a patient mechanic could build the plane . An urge to be on the ground floor was not the only reason to attempt a building project . Escape from boredom was probably a stronger motivation for most of the young men who started airplane projects . Work at the garage consisted mainly of selling small amounts of gasoline and oil and tidying the place . I read classified advertisements in mechanics ' magazines over and over in the hope that I could assemble an airplane from large pieces , rather than build it from scratch . Eventually , two aircraft building projects were under way in WaKeeney . Down on the bypass ( the highway had been moved to the south side of town ) , Joe Masopoust started putting together a Heath Parasol , and I , up on Russell Avenue , in the small corrugated metal building I was using while the new garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mary , a plywood and glue fuselage and landing gear and a pair of wings with ailerons , each fifteen feet by five feet . Henry Erichs ' truck put the things off at my shop . With the wings resting on their noses along the west wall of the shop , the varnished wood fusilage resting on the axles of the landing gear , and everything visible from the street , I was publicly committed to the project . I was excited , but not hopeful . Down deep , I was wondering just when and how the whole project would collapse . Meanwhile , I would be occupied . Masopoust was the better workman . None of the construction problems were beyond him except construction of an engine or money enough to buy a Henderson motorcycle engine in working condition . Eventually Masopoust 's plane got off the ground , if only briefly . By grace of providence , my effort fizzled before it could pose substantial danger to life and health . I set to work to modify a Model T engine for use in an airplane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cranking-up end would be buried just ahead of the pilot 's feet . On the ground , the flywheel served as the main part of the magneto and the means to distribute oil to engine parts . The flywheel picked up oil from the crankcase and dropped it into a funnelshaped piece . The oil ran from there through a tube to the timinggear end of the engine , returning over scooped-out depressions in which connecting-rod bearings splashed to oil themselves and the pistons above them . In an airplane application , an oil pump was needed . It could be installed where the Model T 's generator had been , pick up oil from whatever part of the original crankcase sump was left after its big bulge had been trimmed to fit the nose of the airplane , and push the oil into a copper pipe flattened to // a nozzle at the end and containing strategically placed leaks to fill the pans under the connecting rods . If I did not get it right the first time , it was a small matter . The garageman 's way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill the engine with enough oil so that all the connecting rod bearings would splash . Excess gray smoke would indicate excess lubrication , and fine-tuning could be postponed . I had less trouble providing ignition to the engine . I built a shelf across the end of the oil pan where the fan pulley would have been , found a tractor magneto that turned clockwise from the drive end and had an impulse-starting mechanism that could be inactivated . The impulse starter needs a bit of explanation . Tractors , at least at that time , were started with hand cranks , and it was nearly impossible to spin the engines fast enough to produce a long spark for starting . Instead , an impulse coupling allowed the magneto to lag almost a half-turn behind its proper position , while cranking the engine wound up a strong clock spring . As the engine passed firing position , a catch would release the held-back magneto , the spring would propel it smartly forward , and a fat spark would occur at the spark plug . Aviators frowned on the clock spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the magneto be solidly coupled to the engine . Jittery passengers are inclined to wonder whether it is safe to fly in an airplane that takes a lot of cranking before it starts . Lack of an impulse-coupled magneto is probably the reason . A prospective passenger is entitled to worry , but a slow-starting engine should not be cause for alarm . To test the engine , I bolted a Model T flywheel to the crankshaft , inserted a nail through a hole in the flywheel and found a piece of aircraft control cable with loops in the ends . I // could wind the cable around a ridge on the outside of the flywheel ; connect its inner loop to the nail and pull the engine through its cycle by yanking on the cable . Gasoline in the carburetor would ready the rig for testing . Still I hesitated . I had heard that , unless exhaust valves were protected from direct contact with cold air , they would warp and burn . I wanted a little time to get my nerve up , so I constructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinder block and to stick up at an angle that would give a properly jaunty appearance . I had already done some bending and welding on the pieces that were to be the stabilizer , elevators and rudder . A pint-sized can had been attached by means of a coupling to the fuel line to the carburetor . There was no one in sight on the street . I gave the cable a pull . Success came on about the third or fourth pull . The choke had been set slightly , the throttle had been opened a bit , and the spark advanced as far as I thought safe . When the engine caught , the nail I had inserted in the flywheel to hold the starting cable flew past my head . A staccato set of pops came from the exhaust stacks and blended into a rough roar when I opened the throttle slightly . After less than a minute , I shut the engine down . There was no radiator yet , and any extended testing would have been sure to overheat the engine . Almost as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down from my armpits , I knew that the airplane project was dead . I may have run out of oxygen or acetylene or both and would certainly have little money for more . The inescapable intuitive truth was that I could not complete a large project . I was temperamentally unsuited for what I was later to learn was the trampling underfoot of the meek on the ground floor . // The fuselage with its engine still sat in the shop when , in January 1934 , I enrolled in college . The wings were eventually stored up under the gambrel roof of the big barn at the farm . A few years ago Howard told me that he and a friend had made runners for the fuselage from discarded automobile bumpers and used it for a sled . I think they towed it . Howard had better sense than to put much work into such an unlikely project as a Model T air sled . While I was working on my Model T power plant , Masopoust , down on the bypass ( it has since become the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airframe , controls , landing gear and wings . All he lacked was power plant and propeller . These he supplied by responding to an ad in a mechanics magazine that offered a new , complete , Le Rhone engine and propeller in its original case . I remember that these units could be bought for fifty to seventy-five dollars plus freight . For Masopoust , who was essentially building the airplane from scratch , making the many wing parts and gluing up fuselage sections came first , and rightly so . If one really enjoyed hand work , he could buckle down to the long process of gluing up ribs , placing them on the spar pieces provided and covering and doping them , and prove to himself whether or not he enjoyed the work enough to see the project through . Masopoust knew that he would have to shift the wing forward from its usual position to make its center of pressure coincide with the fore-and-aft center of gravity of the loaded airplane . What bothered him most was welding joints for fittings and tube structures for the undercarriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I was flattered . I had seen some of his welding and was sure it was better than mine . Nevertheless , by bearing // down , I could and did weld several joints and convinced Masopoust that he need not fear for the strength of his own work . So far as I know , none of the welded joints on the plane failed when it was finally tested , long after I had undergone the metamorphosis from country mechanic to scholar . The engine that carried Lindbergh from New York to Paris in 1927 was a Pratt and Whitney radial . Seven cylinders , resembling those on a motorcycle , stuck out like spokes of a wheel from a central crankcase ? that is , they were arranged radially . To an unpracticed eye , the Le Rhone did not look a great deal different . Machined and polished to military specifications and nestled in its shipping box , it had a sculptural beauty . The crucial difference between it and the radial engines manufactured by Pratt and Whitney or Wright was that the Le Rhone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotary . This means that instead of remaining steady in place on the engine mount as did the cylinders of the ordinary radial , those of the Le Rhone whirled around when the engine ran ; the crankshaft , instead of whirling the propeller , anchored the engine to the airplane and , itself , remained a fixed part of the aircraft . To a country mechanic short of money this difference seemed to be something that engineers had coped with , a choice that had produced usable power plants of both types . An astute buyer might have raised the question : Why is this beautiful and sophisticated engine available for only fifty dollars ? Masopoust probably assumed that fashion 's whim was the major reason for preferring the fixedcylinder radial to the rotary . He exercised a trust in anything that could be called The Factory , much as the sucker at a sideshow involuntarily gave his trust to the well-dressed and self-assured // barker . I would have , too , had I had fifty dollars . Barnum was only partly right . A sucker is born of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of selective genetics , but of the universal thrust to be significant . To be a significant airplane builder , one must have an engine ; fifty dollars plus freight was the going minimum price . What Masopoust and I did not know , and the engineers of Le Rhone should have known , was that any rotating mass is a gyroscope , stubborn about changing the direction in which its axle is pointed ; the greater the mass , the greater the stubborn persistence in direction . To make a maneuverable airplane , the rotating crankshaft and propeller must provide less of the undesired gyroscope effect than would a rotating propeller that took seven cylinders and their associated parts along with it . To country mechanics like Masopoust and me , the problem presented in substituting the Le Rhone engine for the specified Henderson motorcycle engine was a matter of proper engine mount fittings and modifying the struts that fixed the wing to the body of the aircraft . The wing would have to be moved forward from its intended position , so that the designated center of pressure for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chord or width back from its leading edge ? would be directly over the center of gravity of the airplane when loaded for flight . Masopoust could accomplish this ; fine-tuning of the fore-and-aft trim could be achieved by adding or subtracting small amounts of weight at the tail skid which , being far to the rear , had a great deal of leverage against the forward parts : propeller , engine , tanks , landing gear and so forth . Masopoust , or any competent mechanic , could cope with the center-of-gravity problem . I have // always regretted not seeing his finished airplane . The completed and doped wing was a beautiful piece of work , a foretaste of the much smaller-scale wings my son Peter made as a high school student many years later for model gliders I towed into the air for him while he held their tethers from the rear seat of our Volkswagen . Howard , who stayed in WaKeeney for a few years after I left , told me that Masopoust 's plane was eventually tested . An airplane pilot from Oakley , west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , but he pointed out that the large powerful engine would require redesign of the tail parts of the Heath Parasol . He indicated the changes needed , and Masopoust constructed the larger , stronger tail . Masopoust himself probably piloted the plane for taxi tests , running down a grass runway without lift-off . It is possible that Masopoust 's friend from Oakley came down , and it is also possible that Masopoust , having gained experience in taxi tests , gunned the engine and allowed his plane to take off . At any rate , Howard reported that the skyline could be seen under the plane ? it was airborne ? before it crashed . Whether it came down on one of Masopoust 's beautiful wingtips or its nose I do not know , but it was , after a great deal of work , a thing of the past . I saw Masopoust years later , in 1947 , when our family , heading west to a job at Whitman College in Walla Walla , Washington , stopped to rest in WaKeeney at Mary 's and brotherin-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggage , furniture and everything , from a temporary post-World War II job at Purdue in an ancient Chevy school bus . A rear axle shaft had been replaced in Cameron , Missouri , and I wanted to 170
