WHEN HE DIED , Osman Lins left an unfinished novel ( 138 pages ) to which in the beginning he gave the working title A cabeca e o corpo ( The Head and the Body ) . Later , as the book was taking shape , he changed this title to A cabeca levada em triunfo ( The Head Carried in Triumph ) , which , however , he did not consider final . <p> Contrary to his usual practice , Osman Lins did not devise a basic plan for this book . He even said , more than once , that this novel would be written without an initial structure . The structure would gradually emerge with the novel itself . This is surprising coming from the author of Avalovara . When he began writing Avalovara he knew exactly how many episodes the novel would have , how many lines there would be in each episode , and so on . In some interviews he said , speaking about Avalovara and some of his other narratives , that he wrote as if he were caging lions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , emotions became more concentrated when offered to readers through a literary aesthetic made of passion and rigor . In this unfinished novel , without any loss of rigor , Osman Lins opened the cages to let the lions roam freely in the story . Perhaps he himself , as a writer , felt the need for this freedom to write about difficult subjects such as the physical decline of a childhood hero and the attitude of a small town in the interior of Pernambuco toward the decapitated head of a bandit . <p> This head arrived at the Palmares train station in a keg to be displayed as a brutal document of the supremacy of the so-called forcas volantes , strike forces that were trying to do away with banditry . The presence of the head made a strong impression on those who were children then , as well as on sensitive people in general , at a time when the media had not yet made murders and atrocities commonplace . <p> Some writers who saw or heard tales regarding this spectacle began to think about writing about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the northeast of Brazil , returning the bandits ' violence with their own terror and barbarous crimes . One of these writers was Hermilo Borba Filho ( 1917-1976 ) , the other , Osman Lins . They agreed to write on the same subject ( they were friends ) , certain that they would create quite different books . Hermilo Borba Filho died before putting this intention into practice . Osman Lins tried to but did not have the time to finish the book . Rumor has it , in the collective imagination of the northeast , that this subject is not meant to be written about . <p> The selection of these passages from Osman Lins 's unfinished novel was made with the intention of presenting particularly characteristic moments of the narration . They offer us a clear picture of the setting , the novelistic space of the work , and the power of the writer 's style . <p> Some scenes show Jose Apolinario old , sick , but still capable of projecting , to the relative who visits him , the kind of aura that made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter gradually turns into an indictment of the injustices perpetrated by our welfare institutions . In this respect The Head Carried in Triumph is linked to two of the author 's previous novels : Jose Apolinario is a Bernardo in a terminal condition , the Bernardo of O fiel e a pedra . And the problem of the precariousness of the welfare system was emphatically dealt with by Osman Lins in The Queen of the Prisons of Greece . <p> In several interviews , as well as in Regina Igel 's biography , the writer always referred to his uncle , whose actual name was Antonio Figuereido , as a character full of tales , imagination , adventures , and magic who may have steered him toward literature . To place this character , so tied to his childhood and dreams , in the situation of fragility and defenselessness that we see in this episode , was for Osman Lins , too , a painful way of facing , remembering , and cutting off fairly deep roots from his youth . At the same time , Jose Apolinario 's physical decay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , where hope , for the neediest , crumbles daily and irremediably , amid discouragement , indignation , and the end . <p> The choice of the second passage fell on the episode in which the head ( which was to give the novel its title ) is taken to the Palmares train station . The same people who had gathered to receive rations ( the victims of the drought ) are watching for a cartload of dead people , but find instead a strange keg containing the head of another central character , a Manuel Izidoro , who in the book brings together several threads of the plot . <p> The chapters or divisions of The Head Carried in Triumph are as Osman Lins left them , but we do n't know if this was to be its final form . Some authors modify the structure of a novel when they revise it , or even at each reading , before they give it to a publisher . With the critical and demanding attitude with which he dealt with his writing , Osman Lins certainly would have worked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clean copy ) and maybe ( or maybe not ) he would have divided the episodes in some other way . It 's impossible to know . But I believe that the selection offered here will give some idea of the world Osman Lins was creating . <p> At times I imagine that his not having made a plan for this book is part of a higher unconscious plan , in which we know , without knowing directly , where we are headed . On a less transcendent level I think that the decision to write without a predetermined structure , this time , responded to Osman Lins 's literary restlessness , to his need to renew himself with each novel , always seeking for himself untraveled paths . Controlling freed lions was to be his new challenge . <p> Introduction of the character Jose Apolinario , at a distribution of food during a drought in northeastern Brazil . Jose Apolinario meets again a relative who has come from far away to visit him . Jose Apolinario had charmed the childhood of this visitor , who has not seen him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Descoberta I thought I was either going to die or the slaughter was going to begin . Where did all those people come from ? Out of the ground ? Were they under some kind of spell ? The only thing I saw was the dust , that big cloud of dust , a low and coiling cloud , the ragged people were coming in throngs , famished but strong , still strong in the legs and in the gullet , they were climbing onto the trucks with such a clamor that nothing else could be heard , and nimbler than I had ever seen : children , grown men , old ones , pregnant women , jostling one another , clutching in their hands tin plates and empty kerosene cans which they clanged together , I saw those legs churning and suddenly it all hurt deep inside , it was like a knife , a drill , it was as if my feet were moving after years , I felt compassion and anger too , I saw the soldiers taking aim , only one got off the vehicle that carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired a short burst , the people continued to rush forward  --  two ? three steps ? then stopped . Many were laughing , as if the shots were a joke . <p> The shops were closed , but there were people at the doors and windows , inside the houses , watching this miraculous event . <p>  --  Line up  --  the corporal shouted . <p> But everybody was afraid to move forward , with the weapons ' muzzles pointed at them , and watched for the next move , who would ever dream of giving up ? These people were above the law , their skin was hanging from their bones , and it was obvious that the government 's charity  --  the manioc meal , the jerked beef , the coffee , the raw sugar  --  was n't enough for everybody . <p> The dust was moving in our direction . I looked at the mob , the dark forms of the women , their heads covered with rags , the children 's open shirts , the sad assortment of hats shading the men 's nearly invisible faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the corporal cried , are you going to fall in or not ? I swallowed hard to keep from throwing up and prayed in my own way , without faith and full of blasphemy , for a waterspout to wipe out , zap , these fugitives of a phantom drought , created by others yet real in its effects , but the sun finally came out , the town square became even larger , more desolate , more arid . <p> It was then that the door of a house opened and an old man stepped outside , an old man somewhat stooped but still tall and lean , still with an invisible mark above his white head , his left hand shading his eyes and the right on his stomach , as if he had a bullet in his guts , what sort of devil was that man ? <p> The tension subsided with every step he demanded of his body , who could that be ? a woman came after him , gave him his hat , tried to bring him back inside , he pulled his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cut off the woman , by his hat , by the way he wore the hat , pulled down over his right ear , with the brim turned up , exposing his forehead , his eyes , I knew that it was Jose Apolinario , coming for his last useless gesture in this world , governed to the end by his way of living , of being , always taking upon himself somebody else 's sorrows , always showing up where he was n't wanted , answering when he had n't been asked , paying when he had n't been charged and never  --  not even this time  --  taking the advantages into consideration . <p>  --  That old man is n't good for anything any more  --  the driver said , looking through the windshield.  --  What 's he want here ? <p> It was apparent , even at a distance and without anything having been said , that Apolinario was n't coming to ask for anything . <p>  --  It 's him I came to see . He 's really in bad shape . He wo n't live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking confused . He looked our way again and made a vague gesture as if asking for help . Reluctantly , he turned around and went back inside , more hunched than before . Yes , his days were numbered , his bill had fallen due , but he still must have had left ( what , authority ? conciliatory power , an aura ? what ? ) some gift I do n't possess , because between the gun barrels and the rags a sort of coming and going , a flux , an exchange suddenly began , a feeling close to camaraderie was born between the militiamen and the mob , who were now laughing freely ( some drought migrants , these , making a jesting matter of poverty ) and by the time I walked into his house the rationing was already under way , all in perfect harmony . <p> It was the wheelchair , more than anything else , that identified me . How could Apolinario recognize , in the crippled fifty-year-old man who still did n't know what to say and bumped into the thin-legged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself was approaching my present age ? First , he stared astonished and not without distrust , his still well-defined jaw slightly hanging ; then he cast his eyes on the chair and I realized that he was reading in my visit his own end , I was tantamount to a death sentence . <p>  --  You , here ? ! <p> It was n't an exclamation of joy but of fear , made worse by the tone of his voice , almost like a beggar 's , humiliated and unsteady . I drew my chair close to his  --  with its pale green plastic cover  --  and embraced him , I embraced that ruin which answered , with what right ? to the name Jose Apolinario and which perhaps I hated , because I could n't achieve the dumb fearlessness , the stupid faith , the mindless zest for life , the fervor without reason , the stubborn trust of a man few still remembered , whose name was Jose Apolinario . Flitting through his mind , as they flitted through mine , through his mind where everything was becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river swims , racing horses , a calm and mature gaze , knives , fire arms , paper kites , muddy roads , bravado . <p>  --  Thank God you 're here . <p> He was looking up , to God , and his chin was trembling .  --  I 've prayed a lot these days . I wanted to see you one more time before I died . <p>  --  We all die . <p>  --  Now I can close my eyes in peace . I do n't want anything else . It 's sad , my friend , you ca n't imagine how much . The deceased liked you so much . She always remembered your birthday . <p>  --  I do n't even remember when it is . Not even me . <p> The cramped house lacked any kind of intimacy ; those who walk down the street can see all the way to the kitchen , and , through the kitchen window , the desolate yard , without trees . Jose Apolinario rented this house to be closer to Palmares , from where the doctor comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the voices of the crowd . In the dining room , leaning over the table , a sty in her left eye , is a twentyish woman , squat , sloppy  --  his second-degree niece and , as far as I know , the only relative he has left in the world . I try to find out what kind of treatment he 's been getting and I come to the conclusion that he 's dying in a state of neglect . Those two lazy bums , the wife and the niece , have done some figuring and realized that an operation , there , is n't going to do any good , that all the hospital does is steal , that dealing with an illness like this is like throwing money away and , if they do n't watch it , when he closes his eyes they wo n't have a penny left and they will be in debt on top of that . Deep inside I agree with them . I think they 're right . Save your own skin , above everything else . Do what , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , who had n't even lifted a finger when the false drought victims were facing the rifles , realized what a mistake I had made in venturing through the jolts and bumps of the world out there to follow a custom revered by old wives , visiting a doomed man on the eve of his death , someone who , why deny it ? I did n't know and who did n't know me . It was when he got up and , leaning on his wife , went to the bathroom while his niece traced invisible doodles on the table with her thick forefinger . I could see them both , he with rawhide sandals  --  considering how much those feet had walked the world they were even well formed  --  she with rubber-soled canvas shoes , one of the laces untied , he with denim pants , loose , his shirt hanging out , she with a green polka-dot dress , her hair dyed , sort of slow moving , Jose Apolinario with his hair completely white , leaning on his wife and moving cautiously , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who never knew what it meant to keep still , a rambler , a wanderer , a pavement pounder , a wayfarer , but if that had been all I would have done my duty , hugged him , you 're going to get well , you 'll be your old self again , I would have gone back in the tank truck and that would have been it . I would not have fallen  --  as if someone had thrown me down the stairs  --  I would n't have fallen into hope , compassion , meddling , those costly traps . But in the dining room , next to his niece , Apolinario stopped  --  was it so difficult to move forward ?  --  and began to cry silently , like a child . His wife was crying , too , saying to him , the way you speak to a child , do n't you cry , the two of them immobile , holding each other , the niece 's sty weighing upon her indifferent eye , old Jose Apolinario and his wife whose name I had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrevocably cast away from happiness and the future , he one step from the grave and she from mourning . Then , unable to restrain myself , forgetting what I am or perhaps because of what I am , I decided to do something , that is , throw coals on the fire , disturb a festering abscess . Wait a minute , I said , a man like him , of means , left to himself , that 's what hospitals are for , the niece lifted her eyelids and grumbled something about those doctors , hospitals are black holes , added the old woman , better mindin ' yourself at home , under your own roof . Apolinario , holding a rag soaked in alcohol at the height of his liver , asked what we were talking about , his wife summed it up looking him in the eye " Hospital ! Palmares ! " " No way ! I 'm going to die right here . " " He does n't want to go , " the niece chimed in . The poor wretch was being swept along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him was to die cheaply , in poverty , paying for death with his suffering . Some of those who had gotten their rations were walking down the street . I insisted on tearing him away from the conspiracy of those two domestic gargoyles , those bloodsuckers , he was absent now , deafer than ever , exposed to the mange of agony like a dog without a master , extracting his final breaths like someone pulling rotten teeth without anesthetic , he 's gon na die soon , worthless old wreck , but suddenly he returned to the outside world , I saw his eyes the way they were when he was a man , " poor folks , " he said , mistakenly , I think , feeling superior , the naked man feeling sorry for the one in rags , it was like measuring the wind by the span , like pretending to be blind . I shouted  --  out of effrontery ? no , to appease some remorse ? no , but because he had come down my stairs , opened my gate , entered the trapdoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I insisted on covering all necessary expenses , I lived comfortably and had no heirs , friendship has its costs ( I meant that it imposed certain obligations ) , the town of Palmares did n't bite , the wind had already blown away all the damned dust , I knew the doctors at the Nursing Home ( specialists in nothing , quacks , incompetent , thieves , gang of white-clad criminals , butchers , this I did n't say ) , if necessary he would be operated on in Recife , what the hell , a friend is a friend . The house lit up , an angel had fallen from the upper spheres , with money in his pockets and a fool to boot , helpless prey , food for vultures , now at last they had it the way they wanted it , the old man taken care of , their nest egg saved , and a clear conscience . <p>  --  I do n't know if he wants to  --  said his wife .  --  If he agrees . <p>  --  It 's enough if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunged me into this predicament ? Compassion , my foot ! I had embarked upon it , instead of on the high seas I saw myself on the high reaches of the world , carried by the waves of pride and the temptation to make those two throw their cards on the table , what cards ? the cards of avarice . False protectresses . Familial vampires . <p>  --  Maybe it 's better this way  --  the niece conceded . The inflamed sty disfigured her moon face , the face of that good-for-nothing . It looked like an eye swollen shut . All it needed was a mustard plaster . <p> Apolinario looked like someone from far away , from a distant land , what I saw in him was a dead man , less than that , the photograph of a dead man , taken a long time ago , in the innocence of what might have been a suffering you take pride in . <p> The Sao Francisco Nursing Home where Jose Apolinario is staying is animated , on the left side , by the sale of horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sounds of a cheap dance hall or a nightclub in a red-light district , the whores who die there do n't feel out of place , they die happy , holding a radio to their ear , " it 's better to give up , " " leave my path , " Brazilian country music , gringo songs . The nurses caught in this trap long ago , simpleminded , came with coconut water , syringes , bottles of serum , saying " peells , " " terlets , " " payshunts . " But they were good people , they came from the sieve , the stove , the scythe , from the can carried on their heads , from the lace bobbin , from the clay , from behind bars , they had taken all kinds of blows from the world yet that had n't spoiled the cotton candy that they were , they were still like cotton in the way they spoke , turned the sick people in their beds , just a little bit , okay ? it ai n't gon na hurt . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kicking , the shouts of sellers and buyers , everything muffled by the thick , woolly curtains in Jose Apolinario 's room . <p> I saw him when he stepped on the scale , his arms behind his back , his left fist in his right hand , I saw him from behind , and where was the indomitable , the tough one , the rascal ? accidents of the flesh , the man who was weighing himself on the hospital 's rickety scale was a boy with nothing weighing on his heart and his whole life ahead of him ( with cancer at the end , yes , but so far away it did n't mean anything ) the boy Apolinario , a skeleton still hardly formed , watched a street singer or a checker game , or a cockfight , or the passage of the saint in a procession , open to any experience , his hands on his hips . The restless animals out in the street , on the other side of the wall , seemed to me , who am a man of imagination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which the boy Jose Apolinario was yet to saddle , mount , buy , sell , drive , trade , tame , take from thieves , wear out , splash in the river , brand , let loose in the pasture . <p>  --  Manuel Izidoro  --  said Jose Apolinario . <p> His face now more tranquil : superimposed on the colorless skin there seemed to be a livelier mask , worn in summers past and buried before him . But that name , hovering in the air , might not be anything , it still might not be , but it might also represent a key fallen out of his pocket . <p> He added :  --  I wonder what became of the head . <p> He ' s talking about Manuel Izidoro 's head , decapitated . <p> The moment in which the keg with the head arrives at the Palmares ( Pernambuco ) station . Lins visited Palmares to see the station and soak up the local atmosphere in 1976 . The station was still there , fairly suggestive , deserted . Lins 's visit to Palmares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted , exposed to the sun , looked as if suspended in time , awaiting the commotion and all the tensions the author would later evoke in his book . <p> Soldiers march determinedly toward the station carrying above their hats , in the middle of the thicket of gun barrels with their muzzles pointed toward the sun , a dried codfish keg , dark and dirty  --  with mud , with dried-up blood , with spittle  --  tree leaves sticking out of a crack , the striped cotton coat thrown over the keg , both sleeves , torn off at the elbow , dangling ( where are the arms and where are the hands ? ) , a piece of rolling tobacco in the lower pocket and crowning it all the huge hat the color of coffee , as wide as the mouth of the keg , the three different women 's garters tied like ribbons around the crown stiff with blood , and , between the bullet holes , a cheap broach , torn from some woman 's dress  --  or perhaps freely given  --  and a silver star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the realization , in terrestrial animals , of what high-soaring birds see and dream about . <p> Those who were awaiting a cartload of corpses heard that a covered keg was arriving ( within : contained , hidden , enclosed , nobody had said what yet ) and come running from all over Palmares , knowing as I do , the power and the importance of the occult , that load shrouded in darkness and carried in triumph ( or conveyed in wrath ? in vengeance ? ) means more than any other piled up in ten wagons and openly transported on wheels . They flock , halfway between bold and hesitant , to the station , and form a circle around the soldiers . Here they come and here I go . <p> Above the plaza 's murmur , a tolling of bells . Somebody says that the southbound train has already passed , now they wo n't be able to take the head to Alagoas to be displayed and buried until tomorrow . <p> Beneath Manuel Izidoro 's black eyebrows , very thick , his sunken eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , as if he were still taking aim , for the last time . <p> Sergeant 16 draws his sword , comes closer , as if he were stirring a wood fire , he pokes at Manuel Izidoro 's head , laughing , so the bandit 's face can be seen better . The face rises full of authority , its expression stern as if it wanted to cut us up . Suddenly , already drunk with the sort of exaltation the arrival of the troops spreads through the town , I see as if some madman were handing me  --  in a new language , unformed , imagined by him , not grasped even by its inventor  --  a decree regarding my fate , which could be my death sentence just as much as the beginning of a fantastic jolt forward , I see that the head in the barrel , discounting the difference in age and Manuel Izidoro 's hare lip , which I do n't have , is my own head , and that Manuel Izidoro , beheaded , a bone thrown in the trash heap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it must be obeyed  --  and I do n't know who he 's shouting at either , maybe the town , maybe me . <p>
