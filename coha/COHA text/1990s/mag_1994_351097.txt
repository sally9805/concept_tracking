SOMETIMES IT DOES N'T PAY TO BE A winner . <P> Just ask Jimmy Johnson , who coached the Dallas Cowboys to overwhelming victories in the past two Super Bowls , then suddenly found himself out of a job last week . Cowboys owner Jerry Jones insisted that the decision to have Johnson disembowel himself was agreed upon " mutually . " Johnson , for his part , embraced his old Arkansas college roommate and insisted to the press , " I can sincerely tell you that I feel better today about Jerry Jones as a friend than I have in our entire relationship . " <P> Off camera , Johnson was a bit more candid . " When you have two people as driven and somewhat egotistical as we are , going as we 've been for the last five years , you 're going to have a natural situation that will be contentious , " he told TIME . Tensions started growing at the end of the first two years , he said , as Jones became less preoccupied with the business operation and more with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) wanted to be more involved , and I 'm accustomed to doing things a certain way . And so that 's where it ended up being a problem . " <P> If there is a lesson to be learned from what occurred in a compound the Cowboys call Valley Ranch  --  which , naturally , is neither a ranch nor in a valley  --  it is not that football has at last been put into proper perspective in Texas . That will not happen in anyone 's lifetime . Rather , it is that old- fashioned hubris , envy and ego are as much a part of running a professional football team as calling draw plays on third down and getting dunked with Gatorade . <P> During their playing days together at the University of Arkansas in the mid- 1960s , Johnson and Jones were not overburdened with talent . Instead , they played clever , which got them as far as the Razorbacks ' starting lineup . Then Jones got into oil . In a substantial way . Twenty-five years later he was able to part with $140 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cowboys . Johnson , on the other hand , slid into coaching , where the remuneration was more modest but the skills perfectly suited to his driven personality . After five years at Oklahoma State , he moved to the University of Miami , where he brought home a national championship in 1988 . <P> The next year Jones asked Johnson to take charge of the Cowboys , replacing the legendary Tom Landry . One of Johnson 's first moves was to cut his wife of 26 years . They had long been having problems , but the move to Dallas provided a final push . A spouse , Johnson reportedly told friends , had value to a college coach who needed to make nice with the parents of recruits . To a coach in the pros she was irrelevant . <P> An owner , however , is not . Especially an owner like Jones , who liked to think he had as keen a sense for the nuances of the sport as the man he had hired . And especially on a team that , unlike most in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager or player-personnel chief  --  to act as buffer . " I 'll try to be very subtle in my influence , " Jones said before a college-player draft . " I can handle Jerry , " Johnson replied . Both were wrong .
