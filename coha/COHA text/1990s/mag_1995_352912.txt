Denise Brown : He grabbed Nicole , told her to get out of his house , wanted us all out of his house , picked her up , threw her against a wall , picked her up and threw her out of the house <P> Christopher Darden : Are you O.K. , Ms. Brown ? <P> Brown : Yes , it 's just so hard . I 'll be fine . <P> Darden : Your Honor , if it pleases the court , can we adjourn and continue this Monday morning ? Your Honor , will the court instruct the bailiff to assist Ms. Brown if she needs assistance ? <P> There was nothing open-ended or ambiguous about the 28 minutes of closing testimony from Nicole Brown Simpson 's sister Denise . Last weekend , jurors lived in close quarters with dramatic memories of Denise 's ragged anger . Her agitated testimony offered a tympany of accusations that struck blow after blow at the base of O.J. Simpson 's carefully wrought image as a celebrity icon , athletic role model and loving husband . By the time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming impression that it had been a very bad week for the defense . <P> Most trials begin at the brutal edge , marshaling the facts of the crime before attempting to pin them on the accused . But prosecutor Marcia Clark and her team chose to set the murder aside for the moment and instead cast their line far back into the past , calling to the stand a cluster of witnesses to events that happened six , even nine years ago , each one embellishing the picture of Simpson as a cruel and abusive spouse . <P> First came Sharyn Gilbert , a 911 operator who received a call from the Simpson residence at 3:58 a.m. on Jan. 1 , 1989 . Gilbert 's testimony allowed the prosecution to introduce a chilling tape in which the jury could hear Nicole 's screams . Detective John Edwards , who arrived at the front gate that night , then testified that Nicole , who had been hiding in the bushes , rushed forward and yelled , He 's gon na kill me ; he 's gon na kill me ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riveting as the three Polaroid photos that Edwards later took at the West Los Angeles station house . In them , Nicole looks stunned , terrified and brutally bruised . Do the pictures fully portray her injuries ? ' ' Edwards was asked . Not even close , ' ' he replied curtly . <P> Edwards then testified that O.J. drove away from the house that night in his blue Bentley . The officers pursued but failed to catch him  --  though O.J. was eventually charged with battering and pleaded no contest . Such a lenient response contradicts a key defense theory of the case : O.J. has been framed by a racist police department . If anything , the cops ' behavior that night seems to reflect a climate of collusion with an idolized sports star . <P> Ronald Shipp , a former police officer who took the stand as a friend of both O.J. and Nicole Simpson 's , gave jurors a graphic glimpse into the couple 's tempestuous marriage . Assistant D.A . Darden elicited solid testimony from Shipp , a domestic- violence specialist , which stretched from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation in O.J. 's bedroom the night after the murder . But , ironically , it was the blistering cross-examination by the defense that indelibly etched the depth of Shipp 's credibility .
