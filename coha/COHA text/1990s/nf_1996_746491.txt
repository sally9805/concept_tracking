Although all students can benefit from a career education program , it is of critical importance for children and youth with visual impairments because they can not learn serendipitously or incidentally through sight . What then are the unique needs of students with visual impairments ? <p> Blind and low vision students need the following : Exposure to visual input  --  access to pictures and reality ( both near and far observations ) that are related to the demands of daily living , effective social and interpersonal strategies , and the range of available career opportunities Opportunities to work  --  doing chores at home , in the community , and in school ( babysitting , yard work , washing cars , pet care ) as well as volunteer experiences , part-time work during and after school , summer jobs , and work-study programs Realistic feedback  --  from family members and significant others about their strengths and weaknesses , evaluation against a defined norm Expectations  --  infused throughout their lives so that they can and will grow up , establish families outside their nuclear families , live interdependently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading and writing skills , efficient use of low vision aids , orientation and mobility skills ( including the use of public and private transportation options ) , use of adaptive equipment , technology ( including aids and appliances ) , job-seeking skills , social skills , and independent living skills <p> The rationale for integrating career education into the core curriculum for students with visual impairments is best understood by exploring the literature on the employment of visually impaired adults . Classic work in data collection and interpretation by Kirchner and Peterson ( 1988 ) indicated that in the late 1970s almost 70% of adults with visual impairments were not participating in the labor market ; they had given up even looking for work . There was speculation that fiscal disincentives contributed to this situation , particularly the ease with which individuals who are blind or have low vision can receive social security benefits and the difficulty they have retaining some portion of those benefits ( for example , medical benefits ) if they choose to work . The authors postulated that discrimination and discouragement could also contribute to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seemingly , little has changed in the nearly two decades since these data were collected . In the 1992 National Longitudinal Transition Study of Special Education Students ( Wagner , D'Amico , Murder , Newman , &; Blackorby , 1992 ) , the authors reported over 60% of students with visual impairments were unemployed 3 years after graduation . Likewise , in a study of adults with visual impairments in Illinois , unemployment rates were near 60% , and the authors presumed the survey sample overrepresented employed people and under-represented those who were out of the labor force ( Harkins , Kirchner , Esposito , Chandu , &; Istanbouli , 1991 ) . Regardless of the exact numbers of youths and adults with visual impairments who are unemployed or no longer participants in the labor market , or both , it is evident that too many visually impaired people are not engaged in one of the most critical activities in our society : work . <p> Recently , adults with visual impairments were surveyed in a national study to determine their employment concerns . Both consumers and professionals were involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items of importance and levels of satisfaction with the items . Items rated high in importance and low in satisfaction were identified as areas of concern . Their greatest identified concern was lack of training in job-seeking skills in their academic programs . This survey sample also identified obtaining adequate information about career opportunities and having access to good placement assistance as significant problems ( Wolffe , Roessler , &; Schriner , 1992 ) . Their input lends credibility to the need for a more structured approach to career exploration and job development . <p> To break the cycle of high unemployment , it is essential that career education be introduced throughout the educational process . Individuals who feel in control of their lives , who understand the complexities of job seeking and career development are far more likely to become successfully employed than those who feel out of control because of lack of information about the world around them . The unique needs of students with visual impairments can best be met while attending public schools . A properly infused career education curriculum can meet many of their needs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Essential Components of a Career Education Program <p> Service providers and caregivers should understand the levels of lifelong career education : awareness , exploration , preparation , placement , maintenance , and mentoring . <p> At each level , individuals with visual disabilities have unique needs in addition to the generic , age-specific ones . My list introduces competencies for each career level , but is not meant to be inclusive . Career Awareness : Young Children Learning about Work What work is : Energy expended to produce a product or provide a service . People work to contribute to the good of the greater society and to support themselves and their families within the community . The kinds of jobs the members of a child 's family perform ( This should include paying and nonpaying jobs ) . Development of work habits : following instructions , assuming responsibilities for self and possessions , being places on time , finding assistance , attending to tasks , completing tasks in a timely fashion , cooperating at play and at work . Development of work skills : learning to sort , putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texture , building , taking apart , coordinating self and tools , using assistive devices , acquiring organizational and academic skills ( speaking and listening , counting , letter recognition ) . Incidental learning : secular and religious holidays , seasons and representative activities , temporal concepts , social rules and mores , clothing worn by different workers , jobs performed behind-the-scenes . Awareness of different jobs within everyday experiences : kitchen chores , such as washing and drying dishes , setting the table , refilling condiments , sweeping or mopping the floor , vacuuming , dusting ; yard and garden work ; washing and vacuuming family vehicles ; pet care . Traits taught by chores : responsibility , reciprocity , self-esteem , self-worth , skills development . Career Exploration : Middle School Work Requirements Increased demands for organizing time : balancing family , community , religious , extracurricular , and school activities Increased responsibilities at home and in the community : volunteering , paid work for family members and neighbors , work for school , band , clubs Increased demands for skill development : academic skills , computer skills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative techniques related to visual impairment Full understanding of work performed by family members , significant others , and key community workers Exploration into identified areas of vocational interest : reading , informational interviews , field trips , guest speakers , job shadowing Further development of work habits : attendance , punctuality , cooperation , following complex written and oral instructions , time and space management Ability to articulate interests , abilities , and liabilities ( self-awareness Career Preparation : Work Competencies High School Students Need Well-developed academic skills : listening , speaking , reading , writing , arithmetic , science , history Values clarification Ability to set personal and vocational goals Understanding resources : allocating time , money , materials , space , and energy Well-developed interpersonal skills : sociability , working on teams , teaching and leading , negotiating , and working with different kinds of people Ability to acquire , evaluate , and use information ; to organize and maintain data ; to use computers efficiently Ability to select , use , and maintain equipment and tools ( varying levels of technology ) Ability to think creatively and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and values to career options Flexibility and self-reliance High levels of self-esteem Job-seeking skills and job-search skills Work experience ( volunteer or paid ) Career Placement : Critical Concerns for Young Adults in Transition Work experiences ( paid , if at all possible ) during and after school Refinement of work-related skills and habits Access to information from adults in chosen fields ( internships , apprenticeships , job shadowing ) Further focusing and refining of interests and experiences to career goals Preparation for postsecondary education or training Participation in meaningful , career-related postsecondary training Networking for postgraduation support Life and career planning Work , work , work <p> The final career stages  --  maintenance and mentoring  --  are entered into in adulthood and at retirement from the work force , respectively . In the maintenance stage , adults work at jobs related to their career goals . They engage in continuing education , both in formal classes and through experiential learning on-the-job , and they advance as their talents dictate and opportunities become available . Ideally , even before retirement age , adults begin to mentor younger workers and teach them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen field . Certainly , after retirement , mentoring is a wonderful activity for older citizens to participate in , one that enables them to share their wisdom . It is important that individuals with visual impairments know about all stages of the career development model and expect to be involved throughout their lives . <p> An integrated career education program involves students as well as their families , representatives of school and adult services , and concerned citizens from the larger community . Without involvement from all of these parties , there will be oversights in content and experiential learning opportunities . Business and community leaders can help teachers and students better understand the demands of the local labor market as well as the resources of the community . Parents and siblings can help reinforce and teach individuals with disabilities the critical life skills they will need in order to live successfully outside their family homes . Teachers and adult service providers can help individuals with disabilities and others in their communities understand the impact of disabling conditions and help students develop the compensatory skills to overcome physical , emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professionals can help students understand and access adaptive equipment and other reasonable accommodations for community access . <p>
