Hard to imagine a less attractive life-style for a young man just out of college than going back to Bismarck to live with his parents  --  unless it 's living with his brother in the suburbs of Chicago , which , naturally , is what I did . Mom at least bakes a mean cherry pie . Joe , on the other hand , got me into a permanent emotional headlock and found some way , every day , to give me psychic noogies . For example , there was the day he gave me the job of figuring out how many jelly beans it would take to fill up Soldier Field . <p> Let us stipulate that it 's all my fault ; Joe would want me to be clear on that point . Just as he was always good with people , I was always good with numbers . As Joe tells me at least once a week , <p> should have studied engineering . Drifted between majors instead , ended up with a major in math and a minor in art  --  just about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Joe , on the other hand , went into the ad game . When the Internet and optical fiber and HDTV and digital cash all came together and turned into what we now call the Metaverse , most of the big ad agencies got hammered  --  because in the Metaverse , you can actually whip out a gun and blow the Energizer Bunny 's head off , and a lot of people did . Joe borrowed 10,000 bucks from Mom and Dad and started this clever young ad agency . If you 've spent any time crawling the Metaverse , you 've seen his work-and it 's seen you , and talked to you , and followed you around . <p> Mom and Dad stayed in their same little house in Bismarck , North Dakota . None of their neighbors guessed that if they cashed in their stock in Joe 's agency , they 'd be worth about $20 million . I nagged them to diversify their portfolio-you know , buy a bushel basket of Krugerrands and bury them in the backyard , or maybe put a few million into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a no-confidence vote in Joe . " It 'd be : ' Dad said , " like showing up for your kid 's piano recital with a Walkman . " <p> Joe comes home one January evening with a magnum of champagne . After giving me the obligatory hazing about whether I 'm old enough to drink , he pours me a glass . He 's already banished his two sons to the Home Theater . They have cranked up the set-top box they got for Christmas . Patch this baby into your HDTV , and you can cruise the Metaverse , wander the Web and choose from among several user-friendly operating systems , each one rife with automatic help systems , customer-service hot lines and intelligent agents . The theater 's subwoofer causes our silverware to buzz around like sheet-metal hockey players , and amplified explosions knock swirling nebulas of tiny bubbles loose from the insides of our champagne glasses . Those low frequencies must penetrate the young brain somehow , coming in under kids ' media-hip radar and injecting the edfotainucational muchomedia bitstream direct into their cerebral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account today , " Joe explains . " We hype cars . We hype computers . We hype athletic shoes . But as of three hours ago , we are hyping a currency . " <p> " What ? " says his wife Anne . <p> " Y'know , like dollars or yen . Except this is a new currency . " <p> " From which country ? " I ask . This is like offering lox to a dog : I 've given Joe the chance to en lighten his feckless bro . He hammers back half a flute of Dom Perignon and shifts into full-on Pitch Mode . <p> " Forget about countries , " he says . " We 're talking Simoleons  --  the smart , hip new currency of the Metaverser . " <p> " Is this like E-money ? " Anne asks . <p> " We 've been doing E-money for e-ons , ever since automated-teller machines Joe says , with just the right edge of scorn . " Nowadays we can use it to go shopping in the Metaverse . But it 's still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> That was for me . I graduated college with a thousand bucks in savings . With inflation at 10% and rising , that buys a lot fewer Leinenkugels than it did a year ago . <p> " The government 's never going to get its act together on the budget , " Joe says . " It ca n't . Inflation will just get worse . People will put their money elsewhere . " <p> " Inflation would have to get pretty damn high before I 'd put my money into some artificial currency , " I say . <p> " Hell , they 're all artificial , " Joe says . " If you think about it , we 've been doing this forever . We put our money in stocks , bonds , shares of mutual funds . Those things represent real assets  --  factories , ships , bananas , software , gold , whatever . Simoleons is just a new name for those assets . You carry around a smart card and spend it just like cash . Or else you go shopping in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show up on your doorstep the next morning . " <p> I say , " Who 's going to fall for that ? " <p> " Everyone , " he says . " For our big promo , we 're going to give Simoleons away to some average Joes at the Super Bowl . We 'll check in with them one , three , six months later , and people will see that this is a safe and stable place to put their money . " <p> " It does n't inspire much confidence , " I say , " to hand the stuff out like Monopoly money . " <p> He 's ready for this one . " It 's not a handout . It 's a sweepstakes . " <p> And that 's when he asks me to calculate how many jelly beans will fill Soldier Field . <p> Two hours later , I 'm down at the local galaxy-class grocery store , in Bulk : a Manhattan of towering Lucite bins filled with steel-cut rolled oats , off-brand Froot Loops , sun-dried tomatoes , prefabricated s'mores , macadamias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag or bucket with a jerk at the handy Plexiglas guillotine . Not a human being in sight , just robot restocking machines trundling back and forth on a grid of overhead catwalks and surveillance cameras hidden in smoked-glass hemispheres . I stroll through the gleaming Lucite wonderland holding a perfect 6-in. cube improvised from duct tape and cardboard . I stagger through a glitter gulch of Gummi fauna , Boston baked beans , gobstoppers , Good &; Plenty , Tart'n Tiny . Then , bingo : bulk jelly beans , premium grade . I put my cube under the spout and fill it . <p> Who guesses closest and earliest on the jelly beans wins the Simoleons . They 've hired a Big Six accounting firm to make sure everything 's done right . And since they ca n't actually fill the stadium with candy , I 'm to come up with the Correct Answer and supply it to them and , just as important , to keep it secret . <p> I get home and count the beans : 3,101 . Multiply by 8 to get the number in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of cubic feet in Soldier Field . My nephews are sprawled like pithed frogs before the HDTV , teaching themselves physics by lobbing antimatter bombs onto an offending civilization from high orbit . I prance over the black zigzags of the control cables and commandeer a unit . <p> Up on the screen , a cartoon elf or sprite or something pokes its head out from behind a window , then draws it back . No , I 'm not <p> paranoid schizophrenic  --  this is the much-hyped intelligent agent who comes with the box . I ignore it , make my escape from Gameland and blunder into a lurid district of the Metaverse where thousands of infomercials run day and night , each in its own window . I watch an ad for Chinese folk medicines made from rare-animal parts , genetically engineered and grown in vats . Grizzly-bear gallbladders are shown growing like bunches of grapes in an amber fluid . <p> The animated sprite comes all the way out , and leans up against the edge of the infomercial window . " Hey ! " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm Raster ! Just speak my name  --  that 's Raster  --  if you need any help . " <p> I do n't like Raster 's looks . It 's likely he was wandering the streets of Toontown and waving a sign saying WILL ANNOY GROWNUPS FOR FOOD until he was hired by the cable company . He begins flying around the screen , leaving a trail of glowing fairy dust that fades much too slowly for my taste . <p> " Give me the damn encyclopedia ! " I shout . Hearing the dread word , my nephews erupt from the rug and flee . <p> So I look up Soldier Field . My old Analytic Geometry textbook , still flecked with insulation from the attic , has been sitting on my thigh like a lump office . By combining some formulas from it with the encyclopedia 's stats ... <p> " Hey ! Raster ! " <p> Raster is so glad to be wanted that he does figure eights around the screen . " Calculator ! " I shout . <p> " No need , boss ! Simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in my head ! " <p> So I have a most tedious conversation with Raster , in which I estimate the number of cubic feet in Soldier Field , rounded to the nearest foot . I ask Raster to multiply that by 24,808 and he shoots back : 537,824,167,717 . <p> A nongeek would n't have thought twice . But I say , " Raster , you have Spam for brains . It should be an exact multiple of eight ! " Evidently my brother 's new box came with one of those defective chips that makes errors when the numbers get really big <p> Raster slaps himself upside the head ; loose screws and transistors tumble out of his ears . " Darn ! Guess I 'll have to have a talk with my programmer ! " And then he freezes up for a minute . <p> My sister-in-law Anne darts into the room , hunched in a don't-mind-me posture , and looks around . She 's terrified that I may have a date in here . " Who 're you talking to ? " <p> " This goofy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't ever use it to do your taxes , by the way . " <p> She cocks her head . " You know , just yesterday I asked it for help with a Schedule B , and it gave me a recipe for shellfish bisque . " <p> " Good evening , sir . Good evening , ma'am . What were those numbers again ? " Raster asks . Same voice , but different inflections  --  more human . I call out the numbers one more time and he comes back with 537,824,167,720 . <p> " That sounds better , " I mutter . <p> Anne is nonplussed . " Now its voice recognition seems to be working fine . " <p> " I do n't think so . I think my little math problem got forwarded to a real human being . When the conversation gets over the head of the built-in software , it calls for help , and a human steps in and takes over . He 's watching us through the built-in videocam , " I explain , pointing at the fish-eye lens built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and listening through the built-in mike . " <p> Anne 's getting that glazed look in her eyes ; I grope for an analog analogy . " Remember The Exorcist ? Well , Raster has just been possessed , like the chick in the flick . Except it 's not just Beelzebub . It 's a customer-service rep . " <p> I 've just walked blind into a trap that is yawningly obvious to Anne . " Maybe that 's a job you should apply for ! " she exclaims . <p> The other jaw of the trap closes faster than my teeth chomping down on my tongue : " I can take your application online right now ! " says Raster . <p> My sister-in-law is the embodiment of sugary triumph until the next evening , when I have a good news/bad news conversation with her . Good : I 'm now a Metaverse customer-service rep . Bad : I do n't have a cubicle in some Edge City office complex . I telecommute from home  --  from her home , from her sofa . I sit there all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beans , wearing an operator 's headset , gripping the control unit , using it like a puppeteer 's rig to control other people 's Rasters on other people 's screens , all over the U.S. I can see them  --  the wide-angle view from their set-top boxes is piped to a window on my screen . But they ca n't see me  --  just Raster , my avatar , my body in the Metaverse . <p> Ghastly in the mottled , flattening light of the Tube , people ask me inane questions about arithmetic . If they 're asking for help with recipes , airplane schedules , child-rearing or home improvement , they 've already been turfed to someone else . My expertise is pure math only . <p> Which is pretty sleepy until the next week , when my brother 's agency announces the big Simoleons Sweepstakes . They 've hired a knot-kneed fullback as their spokesman . Within minutes , requests for help from contestants start flooding in . Every Bears fan in Greater Chicago is trying to calculate the volume of Soldier Field . They 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing it right are probably using the faulty chip in their set-top box . I 'm in deep conflict-of-interest territory here , wanting to reach out with Raster 's stubby , white-gloved , three-fingered hand and slap some sense into these people . <p> But I 'm sworn to secrecy . Joe has hired me to do the calculations for the Metrodome , Three Rivers Stadium , RFK Stadium and every other N.F.L. venue . There 's going to be a Simoleons winner in every city . <p> We are allowed to take 15-minute breaks every four hours . So I crank up the Home Theater , just to blow the carbon out of its cylinders , and zip down the main street of the Metaverse to a club that specializes in my kind of tunes . I 'm still " wearing " my Raster uniform , but I do n't care  --  I 'm just one of thousands of Rasters running up and down the street on their breaks . <p> My club has a narrow entrance on a narrow alley off a narrow side street , far from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cash cows for the Metaverse 's E-money economy . Inside , there 's a few Rasters on break , but it 's mostly people " wearing " more creative avatars . In the Metaverse , there 's no part of your virtual body you ca n't pierce , brand or tattoo in an effort to look weirder than the next guy . <p> The live band onstage  --  jacked in from a studio in Prague  --  is n't very good , so I duck into the back room where there are virtual racks full of tapes you can sample , listening to a few seconds from each song . If you like it , you can download the whole album , with optional interactive liner notes , videos and sheet music . <p> I 'm pawing through one of these racks when I sense another avatar , something big and shaggy , sidling up next to me . It mumbles something ; I ignore it . A magisterial throat-clearing noise rumbles in the subwoofer , crackles in the surround speakers , punches through cleanly on the center channel above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy-set creature wearing a T shirt emblazoned with a logo HACKERS 1111 . It has very long scythe-like claws , which it uses to grip a hot-pink cylinder . it 's much better drawn than Raster ; almost Disney-quality . <p> The sloth speaks : " 537,824,167,720 . " <p> " Hey ! " I shout . " Who the hell are you ? " It lifts the pink cylinder to its lips and drinks . It 's a can of Jolt . " Where 'd you get that number ? " I demand . " It 's supposed to be a secret . " <p> " The key is under the doormat , " the sloth says , then turns around and walks out of the club . <p> My 15-minute break is over , so I have to ponder the meaning of this through the rest of my shift . Then , I drag myself up out of the couch , open the front door and peel up the doormat . <p> Sure enough , someone has stuck an envelope under there . Inside is a sheet of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is what computer people use : OA56 7781 6BE2 2004 89FF 9001 C782  --  and so on for about five lines . <p> The sloth had told me that " the key is under the doormat , " and I 'm willing to bet many Simoleons that this number is an encryption key that will enable me to send and receive coded messages . <p> So I spend 10 minutes punching it into the set-top box . Raster shows up and starts to bother me : " Can I help you with anything ? " <p> By the time I 've punched in the 256th digit , I 've become a little testy with Raster and said some rude things to him . I 'm not proud of it . Then I hear something that 's music to my ears : " I 'm sorry , I did n't understand you , " Raster chirps . " Please check your cable connections  --  I 'm getting some noise on the line . " <p> A second figure materializes on the screen , like a digital genie : it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I ask . <p> The sloth takes another slug of Jolt , stifles a belch and says , " I am Codex , the Crypto-Anarchist Sloth . " <p> " Your equipment requires maintenance , " Raster says . " Please contact the cable company . " <p> " Your equipment is fine , " Codex says . " I 'm encrypting your back channel . To the cable company , it looks like noise . As you figured out , that number is your personal encryption key . No government or corporation on earth can eavesdrop on us now . " <p> " Gosh , thanks , " I say . <p> " You 're welcome , " Codex replies . " Now , let 's get down to biz . We have something you want . You have something we want . " <p> " How did you know the answer to the Soldier Field jelly-bean question ? " <p> " We 've got all 27 , " Codex says . And he rattles off the secret numbers for Candlestick Park , the Kingdome , the Meadowlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm 's vault , " I say , " there 's only one way you could have those numbers . You 've been eavesdropping on my little chats with Raster . You 've tapped the line coming out of this set-top box , have n't you ? " <p> " Oh , that 's typical . I suppose you think we 're a bunch of socially inept , acne-ridden , high-IQ teenage hackers who play sophomoric pranks on the Establishment . " <p> " The thought had crossed my mind , " I say . But the fact that the cartoon sloth can give me such a realistic withering look , as he is doing now , suggests a much higher level of technical sophistication . Raster only has six facial expressions and none of them is very good . <p> " Your brother runs an ad agency , no ? " <p> " Correct . " <p> " He recently signed up Simoleons Corp. ? " <p> " Correct . " <p> " As soon as he did , the government put your house under full-time surveillance . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box is looking very big and beady to me . " They tapped our infotainment cable ? " <p> " Did n't have to . The cable people are happy to do all the dirty work  --  after all , they 're beholden to the government for their monopoly . So all those calculations you did using Raster were piped straight to the cable company and from there to the government . We 've got a mole in the government who cc 'd us everything through an anonymous remailer in Jyvaskyla , Finland . " <p> " Why should the government care ? " <p> " They care big-time , " Codex says . " They 're going to destroy Simoleons . And they 're going to step all over your family in the process . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Because if they do n't destroy E-money , " Codex says , " E-money will destroy them . " <p> The next afternoon I show up at my brother 's office , in a groovily refurbished ex-power plant on the near West Side . He finishes rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cavernous space with a giant steam turbine as a conversation piece . I think it 's supposed to be an irony thing . <p> " Are n't you supposed to be cruising the I-way for stalled motorists ? " he says . <p> " Spare me the fraternal heckling , " I say . " We crypto-anarchists do n't have time for such things . " <p> " Crypto-anarchists ? " <p> " The word panarchist is also frequently used . " <p> " Cute , " he says , rolling the word around in his head . He 's already working up a mental ad campaign for it . <p> " You 're looking flushed and satisfied this afternoon , " I say . " Must have been those two imperial pints of Hog City Porter you had with your baby-back ribs at Divane 's Lakeview Grill . " <p> Suddenly he sits up straight and gets an edgy look about him , as if a practical joke is in progress , and he 's determined not to play the fool . <p> " So how 'd you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I know you 've been cheating on your taxes , " <p> " What ! ? " <p> " Last year you put a new tax-deductible sofa in your home office . But that sofa is a hide-a-bed model , which is a no-no . " <p> " Hackers , " he says . " Your buddies hacked into my records , did n't they ? " <p> " You win the Stratolounger . " <p> " I thought they had safeguards on these things now . " <p> " The files are harder to break into . But every time information gets sent across the wires  --  like , when Anne uses Raster to do the taxes  --  it can be captured and decrypted . Because , my brother , you bought the default data-security agreement with your box , and the default agreement sucks . " <p> " So what are you getting at ? " <p> " For that , " I say , " we 'll have to go someplace that is n't under surveillance . " <p> " Surveillance ! ? What the ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the comer of his office , with its beady glass eye staring out at us from the set-top box . <p> We end up walking along the lakeshore , which , in Chicago in January , is madness . But we hail from North Dakota , and we have all the cold-weather gear it takes to do this . I tell him about Raster and the cable company . <p> " Oh , Jesus ! " he says . " You mean those numbers are n't secret ? " <p> " Not even close . They 've been put in the hands of 27 stooges hired by the the government . The stooges have already FedEx 'd their entry forms with the correct numbers . So , as of now , all of your Simoleons  --  $27 million worth  --  are going straight into the hands of the stooges on Super Bowl Sunday . And they will turn out to be your worst public-relations nightmare . They will cash in their Simoleons for comic books and baseball cards and claim it 's safer . They will intentionally go bankrupt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twos and threes on tawdry talk shows to report mysterious disappearances of their Simoleons during Metaverse transactions . They will , in short , destroy the image  --  and the business  --  of your client . The result : victory for the government , which hates and fears private currencies . And bankruptcy for you , and for Mom and Dad . " <p> " How do you figure ? " <p> " Your agency is responsible for screwing up this sweepstakes . Soon as the debacle hits , your stock plummets . Mom and Dad lose millions in paper profits they 've never had a chance to enjoy . Then your big shareholders will sue your ass , my brother , and you will lose . You gambled the value of the company on the faulty data-security built into your set-top box , and you as a corporate officer are personally responsible for the losses . " <p> At this point , big brother Joe feels the need to slam himself down on a park bench , which must feel roughly like sitting on a block of dry ice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain . I sort of expected to feel triumphant at this point , but I do n't . <p> So I let him off the hook . " I just came from your accounting firm , " I say . " I told them I had discovered an error in my calculations  --  that my set-top box had a faulty chip . I supplied them with 27 new numbers , which I worked out by hand , with pencil and paper , in a conference room in their offices , far from the prying eye of the cable company . I personally sealed them in an envelope and placed them in their vault . " <p> " So the sweepstakes will come off as planned , " he exhales . " Thank God ! " <p> " Yeah  --  and while you 're at it , thank me and the panarchists , " I shoot back . " I also called Mom and Dad , and told them that they should sell their stock  --  just in case the government finds some new way to sabotage your contest . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but they 're going to get hammered on taxes . They 'll lose 40% of their net worth to the government , just like that . " <p> " No , they wo n't , " I say . " They are n't paying any taxes . " <p> " Say what ? " He lifts his chin off his mittens for the first time in a while , reinvigorated by the chance to tell me how wrong I am . " Their cash basis is only $10,000  --  you think the IRS wo n't notice $20 million in capital gains ? " <p> " We did n't invite the IRS , " I tell him . " It 's none of the IRS 's damn business . " <p> " They have ways to make it their business . " <p> " Not any more . Mom and Dad are n't selling their stock for dollars , Joe . " <p> " Simoleons ? It 's the same deal with Simoleons  --  everything gets reported to the government . " <p> " Forget Simoleons . Think CryptoCredits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CryptoCredit ? " He stands up and starts pacing back and forth . Now he 's convinced I 've traded the family cow for a handful of magic beans . <p> " It 's what Simoleons ought to be : E-money that is totally private from the eyes of government . " <p> " How do you know ? Is n't any code crackable ? " <p> " Any kind of E-money consists of numbers moving around on wires , " I say . " If you know how to keep your numbers secret , your currency is safe . If you do n't , it 's not . Keeping numbers secret is a problem of cryptography  --  a branch of mathematics . Well , Joe , the crypto-anarchists showed me their math . And it 's good math . It 's better than the math the government uses . Better than Simoleons ' math too . No one can mess with CryptoCredits . " <p> He heaves a big sigh . " O.K. , O.K.  --  you want m to say it ? I 'll say it . You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing in college after all . " <p> " I 'm not worthless scum ? " <p> " Not worthless scum . So . What do these crypto-anarchists want , anyway ? " <p> For some reason I ca n't lie to my parents , but Joe 's easy . <p> " Nothing , " I say . " They just wanted to do us a favor , as a way of gaining some goodwill with us . " <p> " And furthering the righteous cause of World Panarchy ? " <p> " Something like that . " <p> Which brings us to Super Bowl Sunday . We are sitting in a sky box high up in the Superdome , complete with wet bar , kitchen , waiters and big TV screens to watch the instant replays of what we 've just seen with our own naked , pitiful , nondigital eyes . <p> The corporate officers of Simoleons are there . I start sounding them out on their cryptographic protocols , and it becomes clear that these people ca n't calculate their gas mileage without consulting Raster , much less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A Superdome security man comes in , looking uneasy . " Some , uh , gentlemen here , " he says . " They have tickets that appear to be authentic . " <p> It 's three guys . The first one is a 300 pounder with hair down to his waist and a beard down to his navel . He must be a Bears fan because he has painted his face and bare torso blue and orange . The second one is n't quite as introverted as the first , and the third is n't quite the button-down conformist the other two are . Mr. Big is carrying an old milk crate . What 's inside must be heavy , because it looks like it 's about to pull his arms out of their sockets . <p> " Mr. and Mrs. De Croot ? " he says , as he staggers into the room . Heads turn towards my mom and dad , who , alarmed by the appearance of these three , have declined to identify themselves . The guy makes for them and slams the crate down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guy you 've known as Codex , " he says . " Thanks for naming us as your broker .

" <p> Dad devotes 30 seconds or so to lighting his pipe . Down on the field , the two-minute warning sounds . Dad puffs out a cloud of smoke and says , " He seemed like an honest sloth . " <p> " Just in case , " Mom says , " we sold half the stock through our broker in Bismarck . He says we 'll have to pay taxes on that . " <p> " We transferred the other half offshore , to Mr. Codex here , " Dad says , " and he converted it into the local currency-tax free . " <p> " Offshore ? Where ? The Bahamas ?

" <p> " What the hell good is that ? " Joe says . <p> " That was my concern too , " Dad says , " so , just as an experiment , I used my CryptoCredits to buy something a little more tangible . " <p> Dad reaches into the milk crate and heaves out a rectangular object made of yellow metal . Mom hauls out another one . She and Dad begin lining them up on the counter , like King and Queen Midas unloading a carton of Twinkies . <p> It takes Joe a few seconds to realize what 's happening . He picks up one of the gold bars and gapes at it . The Simoleons execs crowd around and inspect the booty . <p> " Now you see why the government wants to stamp us out , " the big guy says . " We can do what they do  --  cheaper and better . " <p> For the first time , light dawns on the face of the Simoleons CEO . " Wait a sec , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can rig it so that people who use E-money do n't have to pay taxes to any government ? Ever ? " <p> " You got it , " the big panarchist says . The horn sounds announcing the end of the first half . <p> " I have to go down and give away some Simoleons , " the CEO says , " but after that , you and I need to have a talk . " <p> The CEO goes down in the elevator with my brother , carrying a box of 27 smart cards , each of which is loaded up with secret numbers that makes it worth a million Simoleons . I go over and look out the skybox window : 27 Americans are congregated down on the 50-yard line , waiting for their mathematical manna to descend from heaven . They are just the demographic cross section that my brother was hoping for . You 'd never guess they were all secretly citizens of the First Distributed Republic . <p> The crypto-anarchists grab some Jolt from the wet bar and troop out , so now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skybox . Dad points at the field with the stem of his pipe . " Those 27 folks down there , " he says . " They did n't get any help from you , did they ? " <p> I 've lied about this successfully to Joe . But I know it wo n't work with Mom and Dad . " Let 's put it this way , " I say , " not all panarchists are long-haired , Jolt-slurping maniacs .
