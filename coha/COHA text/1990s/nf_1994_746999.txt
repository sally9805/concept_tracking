Antarctica is the coldest , windiest , highest , most inhospitable continent on earth , but it is paradise for scientists  --  and photographers . There are so many things to photograph that it 's difficult to know where to begin . A trip to the Antarctic is really the trip of a lifetime ! <p> For 25 years my late husband , Dick , and I had wanted to go to Antarctica , as we had become intrigued with the penguins and albatrosses when we were on sabbatical leave in New Zealand in 1967 . As we were both biology teachers we were always fascinated by the wildlife in unusual locations . Nearly all penguins and most albatrosses are Southern Hemisphere birds , nesting in the Antarctic or subantarctic islands . How I wish that we had not postponed our trip ; Dick would have loved it ! <p> When the brochure arrived from the Stanford Alumni Association announcing the Antarctica trip , I read the entire itinerary . The group was going every place we had wanted to visit when we went to the Antarctic  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Shetlands , the Antarctic Peninsula , the Lemaire Channel and the Antarctic continent . Peter Harrison , top ornithologist and author of Sea Birds of the World , was to be on board , as well as Paul Ehrlick and an outstanding staff . It sounded so ideal that I immediately enrolled for the January ' 93 trip . Was it expensive ? You bet ! Was it worth it ? And how ! <p> This trip was 18 days aboard ship , with the least expensive cabins around $7500. plus air fare . There are cheaper trips , but be careful ; if you just go directly across to the Antarctic continent across the Drake Passage and return the same way , you miss most of the spectacular islands and wildlife . South Georgia and the Falkland Islands are a " must include . " I also like the direction we went  --  i.e. the Falklands , South Georgia etc. and returning via the Drake Passage . Occasionally you can get cheaper rates on a good trip if all of the spaces have n't been filled and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips to the Antarctic . <p> Our group met in Santiago , Chile , and then flew down to Punta Arenas , Chile , where we boarded the World Dicoverer . Immediately we were warned that the crossings through the Straight of Magellan and the Drake Passage could be extremely rough , and we might have to strap ourselves into bed at night . People susceptible to seasickness were warned to take medications . In our case the " roaring 40 's and screaming 50 's " did not materialize . As calm as our trip was a few passengers were still susceptible to seasickness , including one of our lecturers ! However , most passengers who tried the scopolamine patches found them to be very effective . <p> The only problem I had was having enough time to photograph when we made stops ! At each island , we made several stops , and we were taken ashore in black , rubber Zodiaks , like the ones you see in Jacques Cousteau 's programs . At each location the habitat was varied and the wildlife was unique . Each time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good as the one we had just had ! <p> The penguins were particularly intriguing , as all had chicks by the time we arrived . We studied and photographed seven different species . On some islands there would be only one species , and on others there would be as many as four . In South Georgia we visited a colony of beautiful king penguins which reportedly had 250,000 nesting pairs ; it was an incredible sight . The kings were the largest penguins we saw ; they stand about three feet tall ; the emperor is larger , but that is the one penguin we missed , as it nests during the Antarctic winter . <p> The kings and emperors both incubate their eggs on the top of their feet , and a flap of skin folds over the egg and later the chick . The smaller penguins like the rockhopper , Adelie , Gentoo , chinstrap and macaroni have nests of stones and/or mud , and a few like the Magellanic nest in burrows in the ground . The photography opportunities are endless . <p> The albatrosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nested on cliffs . The wandering albatross , the largest of the albatrosses , with a wingspan of 13 feet , had huge coneshaped nests of mud and guano . One of the smaller albatrosses with a wingspan of seven feet is the light-mantled sooty albatross , and it was on such a steep cliff that we had to use a rope to climb up and then rappel down ! <p> There were many other pelagic birds sighted each day , and of the 78 species we saw , most are found only in the Antarctic . In addition to birds we were also able to photograph fur seals , elephant seals , sea lions and eight different species of whales . <p> The nearer we got to Antarctica the more spectacular the scenery became . Everything was not all ice and snow until we got to the continent . We saw many icebergs early in the trip , and first-time visitors were thrilled with the huge , tabular icebergs ; but old-timers and crew told us they were nothing compared with what we were to see . <p> They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed one that measured five miles in length , but most were much smaller with odd shapes and intricate patterns caused by wind and water . We saw calving icebergs and one which imploded , creating marvelous shapes . In the Lemaire Channel the ship had to thread its way through a sea covered with icebergs which varied in color from deep blue to white . It was an awesome sight and a glorious three-hour trip . Words just ca n't describe the beauty , and it 's not really captured on 55 rolls of film ! <p> Normally I take about 40 rolls of film for a three-week trip , but I was told to double that amount , and it was good advice , as many people ran out of film . Only a few rolls of film were available on ship and the variety of film was very Limited . Most of the film I exposed was KR 64 , and it 's a good thing that we had good weather . Now I would take some of the new 400 film and lots of Fuji 100 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ektachrome 400 HC . <p> Batteries are another important item to have along , as camera and flash batteries do not last as long in cold weather . However , my Nikon 8008S worked well , and I shot over 30 rolls before I had to change batteries . I did use fill flash on some of the penguins , albatrosses and blue-eyed shags . Had we had whiteout conditions or poor weather , I would have used more flash . My camera does not automatically bracket but I did shoot some of the icebergs and white scenes one-half to one stop over . For the most part , the matrix metering worked very well and I liked most of those shots better than the overexposed ones . <p> Another handy item for the trip is a minitape recorder . The bird sounds did n't reproduce well , but it was excellent for recording the outstanding lectures . It 's difficult to take notes in rolling seas ! Also , take lots of minitapes . <p> As for clothes , it 's better to take lots of things to layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed at New Island , it was so warm we could n't stand to wear those red parkas , which are supplied to everyone . ( They are yours to keep . ) Some of us shed them on shore and then walked to the bird colonies . By the time we got to the cliffs a shower was going across the point ; and shortly after , we were called back to ship as the wind had come up to 50 knots , and it was cold because of the wind . Thermal underwear was necessary most days . It was usually 35Degree-37Degree in the morning , warming up to the 40 's or 50 's in the afternoon ; but if that wind was blowing you would think it was below 30Degree ! You need a warm hat and gloves , and good , warm socks . When ashore , knee high rubber boots are necessary to keep your feet dry . <p> Some days we made three or four landings at different locations . On days we had to be at sea we had three lectures and evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a great learning experience . It was also great fun . <p> I hope I have given you a " feel " for Antarctica ; it was such a wonderful experience . The trip was even greater than my expectations . If you ever get an opportunity to take this fantastic trip , jump at the chance . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : " Chinstrap Penguin with Sleeping Twins " <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : " Antarctica  --  Camping the Hard Way " <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : " Iceberg " <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : " Sparring Elephant Seals " <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : " Mating King Penguins " <p> by Norma Mastin <p>
