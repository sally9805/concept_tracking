I was so smug  --  the parent one loves to hate . My firstborn was , and is , the perfect eater . Yep , he 'll taste and eat almost anything , anywhere , anytime . We can , and do , take him to all sorts of restaurants . " A little gravy with your reindeer meat , young sir ? " Of course . " And how about those minced kidneys ? " Delicious . " Extra ( raw ) octopus ? " Oh please . What a child . I was so proud . I took full credit . Time has a way of dealing with the smug . Along came baby number two . This child does n't eat a thing . Nothing . Zip . I do n't care what his doctor says , or how big and healthy he is , he lives on air . I swear . Honest . If his plate is clean , the dog is full . What 's worse , I ca n't even rest on my laurels . Son number one turned nine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at dinner . And no breakfast , thanks . As for lunch , well could I deliver a McDonald 's pizza to his classroom every day at 11:30 ? Who would have thought that serving up a meal would be so exhausting ? Not one to take defeat lying down , I decided to investigate this picky - eater syndrome . What I found were dozens , hundreds , dare I say , thousands , of parents who are equally fed up with their children 's eating habits . There 's a lesson here : we 're not alone . Children go through stages . At first they wolf down anything edible ( and some things that are n't ) . Then one day , they appear to stop eating altogether . They 're not hungry . Seconds before the parents are about to trot them off to the doctor , they start eating again . Now if , in the middle of these cycles , or seasons , we point to a child and say , " He 's a picky eater , " we may create a problem where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " picky eater " is . For example , Mary may be a very plain cook and the household menu may not vary . Mary 's young children will probably eat everything she cooks . However , they may not eat out or eat anything other people cook . Mary may not think of her children as picky eaters , but others would . Mary 's children will eventually suffer the social problems all picky eaters have once they venture past their own kitchen door . Are your child 's eating habits a problem ? Most children will refuse a couple of foods . A child , who having tried a food , simply " does n't like it , " is exercising his or her rights . After all , we adults allow ourselves food preferences . I do n't like canned peas . Does this make me a picky eater ? No . It 's the same with children . If you are worried that your child 's picky - eater behaviour is compromising her health , take a good look at your child 's total diet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's food habits , but remember  --  if too much attention is focused on the problem , if a parent becomes obsessed with the child 's eating habits , or if the child feels pressured , a small problem might balloon into a large one . Look at your child 's food consumption from a weekly , not daily , perspective . Remember that children go through growth spurts , and from this vantage point , many parents discover that their children are doing fine . Talk to the doctor . Hit the books . Call up the local health unit and ask to speak to a nutritionist . Explore . If a child is fit , both physically and emotionally , she will not starve . Most of what is written and said about picky eaters focuses on the child . After all , it 's the child who wo n't eat , therefore it 's the child who must be " fixed . " Not necessarily . How do you feel when your child refuses to eat ? Frustrated ? Angry ? Challenged ? Out of control ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little soul who eats like a horse ( between six months and one year ) turn into a picky - eater ( anytime after one year ) . To some parents , a child 's refusal of food feels like a direct challenge to their authority . If a child is picking at her food to get attention , then a parent who gets upset is delivering that attention , albeit negative . Completely ignore the child 's behaviour . Remove her plate with the rest of the family 's plates and carry on as if nothing has happened . Remember , and repeat this to yourself , if your child is healthy , she will not starve . Experiment . Laugh . It 's OK not to like a specific food but it 's not OK to voice an opinion about foods without having tried them . Watch the unspoken signals , the body signals that every child reads from birth  --  a wrinkled nose , crossed arms , a chair pushed back from the table , a funny sniff , a silly face . Yes , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child as a picky eater who needs to change , realize that a child who refuses to eat does so for a reason . Some of the reasons are perfectly acceptable , some need to be looked into , and others can be ignored , as they will pass . Young children do n't eat because : they are sick , tired or bored they are full they do n't need as much food as we think it is their right to say no they are more interested in talking than eating they are not in a growth spurt and are n't really hungry they are ticked off and want you to know it they need attention , and refusing food is one way to get it they feel they have n't any control over their lives and want to assert themselves something has gone wrong in their lives and they do n't know how to express themselves the flavour is too overpowering , or instinct tells them that the food " is n't right " meals are associated with threats , bribes , nagging , coaxing and yelling . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoiding food , is not a picky eater . The child is in distress and needs professional attention . In some cases , there may be a physical reason  --  the child may be ill . In other cases , the child may be dealing with an emotional problem . Refusing food is one way of crying out for help without actually verbalizing the problem . Many problems , food - related and otherwise , are tied to children 's emotional swings . A child who is nervous about an upcoming school play may not eat because he 's nervous . A child who has been bullied that day , may not eat because she 's upset . We ca n't force children to try different foods . The best we can do is to provide them with excellent examples , encouragement and a never - ending array of foods to sample . Keep it all in perspective . What may be refused one day , may be sampled another day and gobbled up on the third day . Rush it , push it , demand it - - and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
