EVEN UNDER IDEAL circumstances , deciding whether to upgrade to the next version of Windows involves some nail biting , hand wringing , and risk . But with two new versions on the horizon , the choice could be more nerveracking than placing your bet at a high-stakes poker game . As Microsoft puts the finishing touches on Windows 98 , it also will push to complete Windows NT Workstation 5. o , the next version of the desktop operating system geared toward corporations and power users . MANY UNKNOWNS SO IF YOU 'RE contemplating an upgrade , will Windows NT 5.0 be a smarter move than Windows 98 ? The first NT 5.0 beta , which we evaluated for this article , is in too rough a state for us to make any firm conclusions . Many planned features were n't ready . We could n't test the beta for such vital issues as performance and stability . And pricing and hardware requirements had not been set . NT has historically commanded a premium price : Version 4.0 sells for $319 , $145 for the upgrade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here 's what we do know . With the Internet Explorer 4.0 interface , the new version looks almost exactly like Windows 98 , so opting for NT wo n't mean sacrificing any Win 98 interface innovations that appeal to you . Because it 's NT , the product offers far more features than Win 98 for protecting data from snooping eyes and unstable applications . NT 5.0 promises to address some of Windows NT 4.0 's shortcomings , such as its lack of support for Plug and Play and power management , a necessity for notebooks . However , NT 5.0 wo n't be the version that unites all Windows users into one big compatible family . The OS will not support as wide a range of software and hardware-particularly older products-as Windows 98 . Assuming your PC is up to the task of running either Windows 98 or NT 5.0 , the choice may ultimately depend on which you value more : Win 98 's near-universal compatibility or NT 5.0 's emphasis on secure , reliable operation . GETTING UP AND RUNNING WE TESTED BETA 1 of Windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OS . Though hardware requirements for the finished product were undetermined at press time , users with older PCs will likely need to invest in hardware upgrades or even a whole new PC . We found running the beta on a 75-MHz Pentium with 32MB of RAM a little on the slow side , though the shipping version of the OS will likely be faster . Still , you 'll probably want to run NT 5.0 on at least a high-end Pentium system with 32MB of RAM . Some analysts recommend a considerably beefier machine : You may be dissatisfied with anything less than a Pentium Pro or Pentium II system with 32MB of RAM , says Dwight Davis , editorial director at the Windows Watcher newsletter . Beyond performance issues , NT 5.0 should be easier to install than its predecessor , NT 4.0 . One big improvement was apparent the moment we began to set up the OS : We were able to install NT 5.0 over Windows 95 , retaining the existing Start menu setup , desktop settings , and other configuration details . ( The best you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Win 95 and then reinstall all your applications in NT ) Microsoft says that by the time NT 5.0 ships , you 'll be able to install it over Windows 3. x , Windows 95 , or Windows 98 , as well as from scratch on a new system . MORE WIZARDRY ANOTHER NEW addition , the setup wizard , examines your system and warns you of drivers and applications that might not work properly with NT 5.0 . When we tried to install the OS on a new Dell Dimension 200-MHz Pentium MMX system , the wizard produced such a lengthy list of potential problems ( including some with the motherboard and sound card ) , we decided to try another system . We put NT 5.0 on an older Dell Pentium-75 PC , where the wizard reported no major problems . Like its predecessor , NT 5.0 will come with a lengthy Hardware Compatibility List of systems Microsoft has tested it with successfully ; installing it on a PC that 's not on the list can be a dicey proposition . According to Microsoft , the problems we encountered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be resolved before the OS ships . NT AND 98 : SEPARATED AT BIRTH ? THE MOST obvious change in the new NT is its interface . The beta of Windows NT 5.0 looked nearly identical to early versions of Windows 98 we 've seen . Like Windows 98 , NT 5.0 will come with Internet Explorer 4.0 built-in , and will let you choose between a standard Windows 95 desktop and a Web-like interface that supports single-clicking and browser-style navigation of your hard disk , Control Panel , and other items . It 's the same look and feel that Windows 95 users can get today for free by downloading and installing Internet Explorer 4.0 . Like Windows 98 , NT 5.0 is expected to support Universal Serial Bus and IEEE 1394 ( FireWire ) peripherals that have NT 5.0 drivers , as well as the DirectX standards for highpowered games and multimedia titles . Microsoft also plans to add some of the slicker Windows 98 features , such as support for multiple monitors and Broadcast Architecture , a feature for TV tuner-equipped PCs that will provide detailed television listings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embedded in cable TV signals . In the beta version that we examined , none of these features were functioning yet . // NT Closes In on Windows 98 // Indeed , the goal is to put virtually every Windows 98 feature into Windows NT 5.0-but not vice versa . Like its predecessor , NT 5.0 stresses safety and security in a way that Windows 3. x and 95 never have . Windows 98 's password protection remains toothless , but NT 5. o ( like earlier versions of NT ) will include User Manager , a utility that lets you set up password-protected profiles for multiple users , giving them varying levels of access to the PC and network . The NT File System will add even more security-minded features in version 5.0 , including the ability to encrypt files and directories . You 'll need to convert your hard disk to NTFS 5.0 to get all of NT 's features , but the OS will also be able to reside on disks formatted with the FAT and FAT32 file systems used by Win 95 and 98important if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we did in our tests with the NT 5. o beta . The beta also includes a very preliminary version of a revamped Add/Remove Programs Wizard . Unlike the wizards in Windows 95 and 98 , which merely pass control to the installation programs in the application you 're trying to install , NT 5.0 manages the process and actually copies the new software and configures it . As a result , the OS knows precisely which changes were made to your computer . This method has several potential benefits , including tidier uninstalls that remove all detritus , simpler software upgrades , and the ability for the operating system to repair corrupt software installations . Software packages will have to be designed to take advantage of this new approach to software installation , which may also make its way into Windows 98 . The design was not fully functional in the Windows NT 5.0 beta that we ex- amined for this story . <p>
