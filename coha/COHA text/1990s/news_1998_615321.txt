<p> The girl , 14 , locked herself in a room at her LaGrange home , broke a mirror , and threatened to kill herself with jagged pieces of glass . <p> She finally was subdued and taken to a local hospital . The family 's managed care plan , though , told a psychiatrist on duty that it would n't approve a hospital stay . The plan recommended holding the girl there until she was out of danger , then treating her on an outpatient basis . <p> The psychiatrist , Dr. Kenneth Genova , decided to admit her anyway . " She was belligerent , uncooperative , and voiced suicidal threats , " he says now . <p> The health plan , a preferred provider organization , responded by allowing coverage for only 23 hours of inpatient care . The girl wound up staying about 2 1/2 days , and recovered . After months of haggling , the insurer finally covered the rest of the bill . <p> Dr. Genova brought the teenager 's story  --  he did n't identify her because of patient confidentiality rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , joining the push for a state bill to extend patients ' rights to sue managed care plans . <p> That effort failed . A similar HMO malpractice proposal , along with other patient protections , percolated in Washington this year before being swamped by the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the impeachment process . <p> Still , experts say , managed care protections will resurface next year , at both the state and federal levels . <p> In Georgia , meanwhile , the issue has seeped into political races . <p> Democratic gubernatorial candidate Roy Barnes wants patients to be able to go to any doctor without having to pay more for the visit as long as the doctor agrees to the HMO 's payment plan . Barnes ' GOP rival , Guy Millner , generally supports more doctor choice as long as consumers know they should expect to pay higher premiums . <p> In the U.S. Senate race , Democratic challenger Michael Coles , who 's trailing Republican incumbent Paul Coverdell , has stumped for broader rights to sue HMOs in a high-profile TV campaign . One commercial features a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during childbirth . <p> The HMO industry , in turn , condemns the ad for preying on Georgians ' insecurity . <p> Horror stories aside , managed care shows no symptoms of losing its enrollment momentum . Such plans , including PPOs and Point-of-Service plans , now cover up to 85 percent of insured U.S. workers . <p> This new world of benefits has tamed health care costs , which had soared wildly during the 1980s when traditional insurance coverage reigned . <p> HMOs and other plans also have offered low out-of-pocket costs for consumers : $ 10 copayments for doctor visits and prescriptions are typical . And HMOs have provided new prevention benefits , such as annual physical exams . <p> In a study conducted by the National Committee for Quality Assurance , 56.2 percent of HMO members indicated they were completely satisfied or very satisfied with their plans . <p> But with its sudden and explosive growth , managed care also has stoked a sense of anxiety and distrust among many Americans . The doubts surface in movie dialogue , in chatter along office hallways , in medical exam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in its patients ' health  --  or its own financial health ? <p> In fact , one in three respondents in an August survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University said they are " very " worried that their plan is more interested in saving money than in providing them with the best treatment if they are sick . That figure is up from 18 percent a year earlier . <p> " People are terribly worried that economics is driving their care , " says Ron Pollack of Families USA , a consumer advocacy group in Washington . <p> Because bureaucrats often make the medical decisions , not doctors , Pollack says , " People really feel powerless in the process . " <p> The HMO industry acknowledges the patient distrust . Part of it is a natural reaction to massive change , says Kevin Curtin of the Georgia Association of HMOs . <p> " There has been a huge market shift in the last 10 years , from an old fee-for-service system that had crumbled under the costs , " he says . <p> Consumers also are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eventually , insecurity about managed care will fade , he adds . " Time will take care of a lot of it . " <p> Yet politicians are n't waiting . Hundreds of managed care bills have popped up in state legislatures nationwide in recent years . And President Clinton made a Patient Bill of Rights a top legislative priority in Congress . <p> Among proposed managed care regulations : <p> Making it easier to obtain coverage for an emergency room visit ; Allowing consumers to appeal a health plan 's decision to an independent review panel ; Giving consumers with employer-sponsored coverage broader rights to sue health plans . <p> The malpractice proposal is perhaps the most confusing and divisive . <p> Many Americans belong to self-funded health plans through their employers , and due to a law called ERISA , have limited rights to sue their health plan . Health insurers " are immunized from liability , unlike any other industry in America , " says Adrienne Mitchem of Consumers Union , publisher of Consumer Reports . <p> Democrats pushed for strong liability reform in their patient protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on reforms that both sides agreed to  --  such as independent reviews  --  the competing bills varied widely in their scope . <p> The price tag of reform also created noise . Though the HMO industry warned the cost of insurance would rise by up to 10 percent , other estimates put the increase at 1 percent to 4 percent . <p> For business leaders , any premium increase gets attention . Small businesses again rank the cost of health insurance as their No. 1 problem , according to a new Georgia survey by the National Federation of Independent Business . <p> One such business , Atlanta Supply Co. , which sells heating and air conditioning components , is giving health benefits to employees for the first time this year , using an HMO . <p> The firm 's president , Jack Alexander , says he would oppose any regulation that would raise the cost of premiums . He says health care is one cost he ca n't control . " I do n't think these costs should outpace inflation , " Alexander says . <p> The HMO industry calls the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could raise premiums up to 8.6 percent , and would extend the liability not just to insurers , but also to employers . <p> But supporters of broader lawsuit rights point to a new Texas law on managed care malpractice , passed a year ago . <p> The law holds HMOs and other managed care plans liable for negligent medical decisions that harm patients , allowing them to sue their plans . The Texas law also created an independent review process for patients to challenge decisions made by managed care plans . <p> About 200 such cases have been reviewed in the law 's first year . The verdicts have been split , with about half supporting the health plan , half the consumer . And , there have been no malpractice lawsuits filed under this law , the Texas Department of Insurance reports . <p> " Health care premiums have not gone up because of the bill , " adds Lee Jones , a department spokesman . <p> The liability law creates a proper deterrent , says Pollack of Families USA . " In managed care , all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law ) does is make an HMO have to think twice about denying care . " <p> But Curtin , of the Georgia Association of HMOs , says drawing conclusions from the Texas law is premature . " In two or three years , we may get an accurate view of it , " says Curtin , predicting an eventual tide of lawsuits . <p> That is , if the law remains on the books . A federal judge in Texas struck down the review process as violating ERISA , but upheld the malpractice lawsuit right . The decision is being appealed , in a case that may wind up in the U.S. Supreme Court . <p> The ERISA shield is a familiar theme with regulators in Georgia . From 40 percent to 50 percent of consumer complaints to the Department of Insurance are from people in ERISA plans , which are exempt from state regulations . <p> " ERISA plans can do almost anything they want to do , " says Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine . " We really do n't have any power . <p> " We tell ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he adds . " They 're shocked . " <p> The leading complaints : Insurer delays in paying claims , denials of benefit claims , and denials of the " medical necessity " of services . <p> Oxendine backs better oversight of ERISA plans . As for the right to sue health plans , he suggests the legislature decide the issue . <p> Expect such a bill in next year 's General Assembly , says David Cook , legislative counsel for the Medical Association of Georgia . Another likely bill would establish a Texas-like review process of managed care decisions . <p> And next year 's Congress will face another round of managed care proposals , says Pollack of Families USA . " Many people have experienced problems with HMOs , and heard about family members ' and friends ' problems , " he says . <p> It 's not an issue of rich vs. poor , Pollack says . " This issue falls squarely on the middle class . People are really angry . " Each Sunday through the Nov. 3 election , the Journal-Constitution will look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander / ALICIA HANSEN / Staff Graphic : WHAT IS ERISA AND WHY DOES IT MATTER Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act , companies that pay for their workers ' health benefits directly , rather than buying insurance to pay the bills , are exempt from state insurance regulations and taxes . Most large employers have these " self-funded " plans . And the percentage of insured U.S. workers who get benefits through these plans has tripled since 1980 , to an estimated 36 percent . ERISA also shields non-government health plans from punitive and compensatory damage claims in state courts . Patients can sue health plans and employers in federal court for the cost of a denied benefit , attorneys fees and court costs , but not for compensatory or punitive damages . <p> CONSUMER PROTECTION PROPOSALS Three separate bills introduced in Congress have various provisions designed to protect patients in managed care plans . The bills , though , differ widely in their restrictions and rules . Besides lifting restrictions on lawsuits , here are the general areas of proposed protections : 1 . Emergency Services : Guarantees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prudent layperson " would consider them necessary . 2 . Point-of-service option : Expands choice for out-of-network coverage to patients in HMOs without that choice . 3 . Access to specialists : Provides easier access to pediatricians , ob/gyns and medical specialists . " Gag " clauses : Health plans can not prohibit doctors from advising patients about their health status , medical care or treatment . Information disclosure : Requires managed care plans to give members more information about covered benefits , pre-authorizations , drug formularies and other coverage topics . Grievances : Establishes rules for patients who want to appeal a health plan 's decision , including an independent review board . Confidentiality : Requires health plans to safeguard privacy of individual health information . Graphic : Georgians ' health plans In the ' 90s , more Georgians have left traditional insurance to join managed care plans . They consist of health maintenance organizations ( HMOs ) , preferred provider organizations ( PPOs ) and point-of-service plans , which are similar to HMOs but allow some benefits for care received from out-of-network medical providers .
