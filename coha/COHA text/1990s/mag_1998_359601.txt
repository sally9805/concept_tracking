Given that Japan 's economy is sinking further into recession each day and the world 's top economists are clamoring for a rescue , and given that American officials , after long criticizing the Japanese government 's inaction , have lately been trying to be conciliatory and quietly helpful , you might have thought that last weekend 's bank-rescue agreement between Prime Minister KEIZO OBUCHI and the opposition would immediately encourage better relations with Washington . Wrong . Ever since an unproductive meeting between Treasury Secretary ROBERT RUBIN and Japanese Finance Minister KIICHI MIYAZAWA in San Francisco on Sept. 5 , Miyazawa 's office has dodged attempts to set further discussions with U.S. officials . And last Friday , on the eve of Obuchi 's summit with BILL CLINTON , his chief Cabinet secretary abruptly canceled a meeting with U.S. Ambassador THOMAS FOLEY in Tokyo . The cancellation may have been partly in response to what Tokyo sees as a rather flaccid American response to North Korea 's launch of a missile over Japan two weeks ago . For their part , U.S. officials fear that Japan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obuchi government . If the trend continues , then Japan can not expect Washington 's spirit of camaraderie to last for long . <P>  --  By Frank Gibney Jr. /Tokyo
