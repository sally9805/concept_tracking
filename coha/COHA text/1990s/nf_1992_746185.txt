The present study investigated the relationship between hostility , belief systems , coping styles , and illness . Hostility is of interest when considering the stress illness relationship because it has been associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease as well as general mortality . The results suggest that individuals prone toward hostility are more likely to succumb to illness and adhere to irrational beliefs than individuals not so oriented . In addition , hostile individuals were found to employ different . and perhaps less adaptive , coping styles than their low hostility counterparts . It was concluded that the belief systems and coping styles typically employed by individuals prone toward hostility may he important mediating variables in the relationship behveen hostility and illness . These factors may also be important to take into account in treatment programs designed to reduce illness risks for such individuals . Finally , this study suggests that stress-induced impairment of health for hostility-prone individuals may begin much earlier than the vast majority of the literature currently suggests . <p> The present study investigated possible mediating factors in the relationship between stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetic , dietary , environmental , sociocultural , and **32;375;TOOLONG factors in yet undetermined proportions . In particular , this study focused on hostility , a cognitive-behavioral factor that has been associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease as well as general mortality ( Barefoot , Dahlstrom , &; Williams , 1983 ; Barefoot , Williams , Dahlstrom , &; Dodge , 1987 ; Dembroski , MacDougall , Williams , Haney , &; Blumenthal , 1985 ; Shekelle , Gale , Ostfeld , &; Paul , 1983 ; Williams et al. , 1980 ) . The belief systems and coping styles of hostility-prone individuals were assessed , as was their susceptibility to minor illness . <p> For centuries , anger and hostility have been suspected of playing a role in the etiology of coronary heart disease ( Dembroski , MacDougall , Herd , &; Shields , 1983 ) . Since anger and hostility are constituents of the Type A **30;409;TOOLONG complex , they have received considerable attention in recent years . Although a large body of research suggests that Type A behavior is an independent risk factor for coronary heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disease , 1981 ) there is inconsistency in this literature ( Matthews , 1988 ) . Reasons for these inconsistencies include : ( 1 ) use of different Type A assessments yields varying results ( Jenkins , Rosenman , &; Zyzanski , 1974 ) ; ( 2 ) research on different types of populations ( e.g. , high versus low risk populations ) demonstrates differential effects ( Matthews , 1988 ) ; and ( 3 ) only some of the elements within the Type A complex ( e.g. , hostility , time urgency ) lead to poor health outcomes . Within the literature that investigates health correlates of different aspects of the Type A complex , hostility is considered by some to be the leading " toxic ' element ( Dembroski &; Costa , 1987 ) . <p> Although the population under investigation in this study includes a subset of the Type A population , it is best viewed as a somewhat different , although overlapping , population . That is , not all individuals classified as Type A may be hostile ; and not all individuals classified as hostile may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the characteristic examined here is considered to be a stable trait ( Smith &; Frohm , 1985 ) . <p> Regarding the factors that link hostility to poor health , two types of causal factors have been investigated . One type is heightened physiological reactivity ( i.e. , increased blood pressure and heart rate , increased neuroendocrine output ) , particularly in interpersonally stressful situations . The other type of factor is psychosocial vulnerability ( i.e. , an abundance of psychosocial stressors , coupled with a lack of adequate psychosocial resources ) . Considerable evidence suggests that both factors are associated with hostility and that they may be interactive ( Smith &; Pope , 1990 ) . That is , the hostile person tends to create a tumultuous interpersonal environment , resulting in frequent physiological hyperactivity . This repeated taxing of the cardiovascular and immune systems is believed to lead ( or contribute ) to illness . <p> Research on the psychosocial correlates of hostility suggests that hostile individuals tend to display less hardiness , experience more frequent and severe hassles , have fewer and less satisfactory social supports , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Costa , Zonderman , McCrae , &; Williams , 1986 ; Houston &; Kelly , 1989 ; Smith and Pope , 1990 ) . In addition , this type of stressful interpersonal world has been associated with increased risk for illness and mortality ( Berkman &; Syme , 1979 ; House , Robbins , &; Metzner , 1982 ) . <p> The literature reveals no published studies on the relationship between hostility-prone individuals and irrational beliefs or coping styles . However , Hogg and Deffenbacher ( 1986 ) found irrational beliefs to be associated with state anger , and Type A behavior has been associated with dysfunctional beliefs regarding personal performance and achievement ( Burke , 1985 ; Martin , Kuiper , and Westra , 1989 ) . Defares ( 1982 ) , in summarizing the literature on the coping styles of Type A individuals , suggests that they tend to cope with stress by action-proneness , vigorous attempts to control their environment , refusal of social support , and denial of disappointment or fatigue . When coping efforts fail , self-blame , as well as feelings of hopelessness and helplessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coping styles of Type A individuals reveal the type of maladaptive coping styles Defares suggests ( dickers , Hervig , Rahe , &; Rosenman , 1981 ; Vingerhoets &; Flohr , 1984 ) . Given that one can not resolve this inconsistency solely on the basis of the employment of different measures of coping , one might qualify Defares 's view by saying that it holds true only in certain types of situations , yet to be determined . <p> The literature does not reveal information on differential prevalence rates of hostility between women and men . However , Type A behavior is more frequent in men than women , and coronary heart disease is approximately seven times more frequent in Type A professional women than Type B homemakers ( Friedman &; Ulmer , 1984 ) . Finally , a question of interest that apparently remains unaddressed in the literature is whether high hostile individuals succumb to more illness in their earlier years and not just in later life . METHOD <p> Participants included approximately equal numbers of male and female students , both graduate and undergraduate . Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 61% ) returned their completed questionnaire packets . The packets included the Irrational Beliefs Tests ( Jones , 1969 ) , the Cook and Medley Hostility Scale ( 1954 ) , the Physical Symptoms Checklist ( a checklist of 90 symptoms commonly recognized by professionals as having psychological components in their etiology ) . and the Ways of Coping Questionnaire ( Folkman &; Lazarus , 1988 ) , in that order . Since hostility was the concept of interest , coupled with the assumption that coping strategies tend to be situation-specific ( Lazarus &; Folkman , 1984 ) - e.g. , the way one copes with depression may be different than the way one copes with anger-participants were asked to respond to the Ways of Coping Questionnaire in light of an interpersonal anger-provoking situation . That is , a scenario involving major personal loss as a result of unjust treatment by a colleague was described ; participants were asked to answer questions in view of how they would generally cope with that type of situation . <p> Analysis of the data proceeded as follows . The sample was divided into two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hostility Scale . Multivariate analysis of variance ( MANOVA ) was used to analyze differences in belief systems and coping styles between high and low hostile groups . The type of MANOVA implemented was a profile analysis . To facilitate interpretation of results , separate profile analyses were conducted on the Irrational Beliefs Test scores and the Ways of Coping Questionnaire scores . Correlational analyses were used to assess the relationship between hostility and illness . RESULTS <p> Hostility and Illness . Results indicate that hostility was significantly correlated with both the number and severity of illnesses experienced for both men and women , as can be seen in Table 1 . Self-assessed anger ( i.e. , a " yes " response to the statement " I am easily angered " on the Cook and Medley Hostility Scale ) was also found to be associated with both the number and severity of illnesses . In addition , Cook and Medley Hostility Scale scores and self-assessed anger proneness were significantly correlated . <p> Hostility and Irrational Beliefs . As can be seen from Table 2 , profile analysis revealed that high and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beliefs Test ( IBT ) . However , there were no significant differences between men and women , nor was there an interaction between hostility and gender . In particular , high hostile individuals reported more irrational beliefs on five of the 10 IBT scales than did low hostile individuals . These scales were : ( 1 ) IBT1-Love from everyone is necessary ( as opposed to love from most is desirable ) ; ( 2 ) IBT2-Competence is necessary ( as opposed to competence in some area is desirable ) ; ( 3 ) IBT3-Villains should be punished ( as opposed to people are partially bad ) ; ( 4 ) IBT6-Dwell on negative possibilities ( as opposed to prepare for negative outcomes and forget it ) ; and ( 5 ) IBT9-I am doomed to my past by present limitations ( as opposed to I have control over my current decisions ) . The seventh scale-difficulties should be avoided as long as possible ( as opposed to difficulties faced usually solve themselves ) - also approached significance ( p = .06 ) . <p> Hostility , Gender , and Coping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving the Ways of Coping Questionnaire ( WCQ ) , suggest that high and low hostile individuals differed in their responses to this questionnaire , as did men and women . Once again , the interaction between hostility and gender was not significant . Relative to their low hostile counterparts , high hostile individuals were more prone to employ confrontive , distancing , and escape-avoidance coping styles in dealing with anger provoking situations , as well as to accept responsibility for negative events over which they have little control or were not responsible for . The confrontive coping style ( WCQ1 ) indicates the display of hostile and risk taking tendencies , as well as aggressive efforts to alter the situation . The distancing coping style ( WCQ2 ) involves the use of cognitive efforts to detach oneself from , and minimize , the significance of the situation . The escape-avoidance coping style ( WCQ6 ) describes wishful thinking and behavioral efforts to escape or avoid the problem . Accepting responsibility ( WCQ5 ) entails an acknowledgment of one 's own role in the problem , with a concomitant theme of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1988 ) . The tendency to employ a distancing coping style was more pronounced for men than women , while the use of an escape-avoidance coping style was more pronounced for women than men . CONCLUSIONS <p> The results suggest that the belief systems and coping styles of high hostile individuals may constitute a cyclic , self-perpetuating system . Tendencies toward perfectionism , or unrealistic expectations of the self ( IBT2 ) , can lead to feelings of failure when the self can not live up to these expectations . Unrealistic expectations of others ( IBT1 ) can lead to feelings that others have failed one as well , which in turn can lead to vindictive tendencies ( IBT3 ) . Frequent feelings of failure of the self and others to meet one 's expectations can lead to pessimism ( IBT6 ) and helplessness ( IBT9 ) , which , in turn , can result in problem avoidance ( IBT7 ) . <p> The belief systems of hostile individuals may also be related to their coping styles . The vindictive beliefs incorporated in IBT3 can easily lead to the hostile tendencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , the unrealistic expectations of the self and others ( IBT1 and IBT2 ) can lead to the use of a confrontive coping style , due to the frustration one feels over the inability of the self and others to meet these unrealistic expectations . Further , pessimism ( IBT6 ) can lead to the use of a confrontive coping style via a tendency to focus on the faults of others . <p> The finding that high hostile individuals are more prone than their low hostility counterparts to accept responsibility for negative situations which another person caused suggests a tendency toward erroneous self-blame . This can lead to frustration which , turned outward , can result in hostile feelings and/or behavior . Unrealistic expectations of the self ( IBT2 ) can easily lead to erroneous self-blame as the person tends to expect the self to accomplish these impossible feats and then blames the self when it fails . <p> Several of the IBT scales are implicated in the use of the distancing and escape-avoidance coping styles . Since the use of behavioral efforts to avoid problems is part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief that problems should be avoided ( IBT7 ) is incorporated in this cognitive style . Pessimism ( IBT6 ) can easily lead to the use of a distancing and/or escape avoidance cognitive style by construing a situation as so negative that it appears impossible to cope effectively . Similarly , the belief that one can not change ( IBT9 ) can lead to these two coping styles , via feelings of helplessness and hopelessness . That is , if one believes one lacks the power to effect constructive change , escaping the situation may appear to be the most appropriate coping strategy . <p> Figure 1 presents a model of the prospective interrelationships between the belief systems and coping styles of hostility prone individuals . <p> Overall , results suggest that the belief systems and coping styles typically employed by high hostile individuals may be important mediating variables in the relationship between hostility and illness . Their belief systems tend to be characterized by unrealist ic expectations , pessimism , and a lack of faith in their ability to deal effectively with problems . Anger-provoking situations tend to be dealt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid the situation . This indicates feelings of being overwhelmed by the situation , accompanied by an inability to cope with it effectively . Hence , it appears that hostile individuals not only encounter a surplus of anger-provoking situations , given their nature , but also have difficulty coping with them . Finally , the results suggest that stress-induced impairment of health for these individuals may begin much earlier than the vast majority of the literature in this area presently suggests . <p> Future research could benefit from a longitudinal approach to the assessment of the relationships between hostility , belief systems , coping styles , and health to determine the stability of such relationships over time . If stability were found , dysfunctional belie &; and coping styles would be important to take into account in treatment programs designed to reduce illness risks . <p> One of the limitations of this cross-sectional study , of course , if that the stability of relationships found can not be determine . Additional research on other psychosocial factors might be undertaken ( e.g. , social support networks , locus of control , dominance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hostile individual 's psychosocial world , since some research suggests these factors play a role in the etiology of heart disease and other illnesses ( Houston , 1986 ; VanderVoort , 1990 ) . Such investigations might include an analysis of gender differences . Although this study found no differences in belief systems and coping styles between high hostile men and women , there may be important differences on other psychosocial factors . Finally , future studies might investigate whether the processes responsible for the relatively minor illnesses that hostility-prone individuals were found to succumb to in this study are related to the major illnesses they tend to succumb to in later life . <p>
