<p> THE early tides of fall move with a lonely splendor . They follow the September storms , and the currents run clear and cool and strong as they push new life along the bay shores and grass flats . They wipe clean the dregs of summer . This is fishing water , the best of the year for a new crew of coastal anglers . <p> It is in early fall when the shallow-water fishing is finest . <p> The coppered schools of redfish forge onto the flats , scattering mullet and shrimp against bold surges and sudden boils . The fish are large and the water is shallow , and the game is a blend of hunting and fishing . <p> This is sight casting with a fly rod in Texas . <p> The old salt moves with the patience and deliberation of a heron as he eases through shin-deep water . To the uninitiated accustomed to the deep green and blind ambition of open bays and channels , the flat would seem too shallow . But  --  not here , not now . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The surface is slick and the dawning sun is breaking a rim of clouds beyond the barrier island . The expanse is vast and natural . <p> The lonesome angler is a predator , watching and waiting , never casting without purpose . He holds the long , light fly rod loosely , with enough line stripped from the reel and trailing from the tip to " " load " for an opportunistic chance . <p> There ! A chugging wake marks the progress of a prowling fish . <p> The humping surge is twice magnified by the " " skinny " water and the calm surface . The fish seems larger than life . <p> The movement pauses and the wake subsides and  --  Yes !  --  a wide tail fans the air . The caudal is bronze and black , tipped in powder blue , the unmistakable pennant of a redfish . The tail stirs and flashes as the inverted fish roots at the bottom . Out of seemingly nowhere this grand prize is now within reach . <p> The old salt stops , measuring the distance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrations and , instinctively , to push any lurking stingrays out ahead . He has done this many times , yet thrills to the urgent pulse . If there is a cat-fang moment in all of fishing , this is it . <p> The old excitement was sharpened by the new tackle ; the fly rod is gaining support on the Texas Coast but it remains a fresh dimension to most anglers . <p> Veterans seasoned by decades of plugging would raise skeptical eyebrows when the old salt pulled the 9-foot , 7-weight rod from its tube . The concept of a light presentation on sighted fish in shallow water seems logical but , well , this ai n't Montana . <p> " " But it 's as good as Florida . " <p> The heavy fish turns with a quick sweep  --  chasing a desperate and luckless grass creature  --  then cuts an arrogant wake . The moving " " V " settles and disappears . The old salt waits . <p> It remains a mystery how such shallow water can swallow a big fish . <p> The wader continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher , " he thought , " " I could see him . I know he is still here . " There ! <p> The water bulges and , for an instant , the thick back is visible . Now the saucy tail wags . The bold fin always looks big , but this fish is exceptional , maybe 10 or 12 pounds . The distance was a bit long but the chance was ripe . Another disappearance , however brief , might be trouble . <p> The old salt measured the cast and chewed his lip , pulling several additional yards of shooting line from the reel . The simple clicker chattered with each yank . Practiced hands rolled the line into the air with a crisp , powerful false cast . <p> The yellow line snaked to the rear , moving low and flat and gathering speed . The rod tip flexed , following the power , then drove forward as a positive downward pull exploded the trailing shooting line from the water . <p> A home run . The elegant double haul was a supercharger for the extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streamer fell with a fuzzy plop about 2 feet beyond the grubbing fish . The 4-inch feathers were chartreuse and white , accented with sparkling strands and a bushy head . A pair of bright eyes completed the charade . The offering pulsed with life and color yet weighed almost nothing  - -  the fly-rodder 's great trump when pressing a skittish , shallow fish . <p> As the streamer touched down , the old salt crouched slightly and pointed the rod down the line . He pulled the line in short yanks with his left hand , stripping the bouyant fly alongside the busy fish . <p> The fly , barely submerged in the surface film , pushed a faint wake . He paused , allowing the offering to settle several inches , then gave a quick twitch . The water heaved with sudden emotion . <p> " " Do n't take it away from him . Wait until you feel him in the rod . " <p> The big redfish surged forward and turned sideways , flashing a clop of jaws and a golden flank . A growing and irresistible weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line hand set the hook ; the sudden resistance was a main-line rush into the hand , a direct contact between hunter and hunted lacking with other tackle . <p> The startled fish slashed at the surface , bucking and kicking , then bore across the flat . The coils of retrieved line carried through the guides and 20 or 30 yards spun from the reel . <p> The old salt felt the faint staccato as the trim backing knot passed through the rod guides . The rod nodded as the fish slowed and churned . <p> The old salt dug his heels into the sand and made the fish work against the rod . He respected the rugged determination of a good red , the way they drive and drive and never slide to hand until whipped . There is no treachery in the struggle . <p> The fish created a chugging wake and the old salt took a moment to revel in the moment . He enjoyed the open flat and the low passage of trading shorebirds . The sun now was above the clouds , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends and ran . It lumbered into a sodden weed mat and threshed and rolled . The fisherman sloshed forward , holding the rod high , and cleared the line from a tendril of grass . The fish sensed the nearness and bolted in a scatter of spray . <p> The redfish was tiring . It plodded and churned , tilting on its side . The bold scales reflected the October sun . " " He 's done , " the old salt exulted . He arched the high rod back and fingered the thin leader and glided the fish close . <p> The redfish carried the rich colors of the marsh as compared to the washed silver of the surf runners . The big eye stared blankly and the fins stirred softly . The sodden fly was hung in the corner of the glum jaw  --  a clean snatch as the fish had turned . <p> The old salt knelt and cradled the red , knowing without having to measure that it was well over the maximum limit of 28 inches . Not that it mattered . <p> He seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he preferred the smaller ones for the table and found himself keeping fewer and fewer of those . School specks filleted better and were less of a tax on the quality fishing . <p> The old salt pushed the hook free and righted the red , feeling a fresh power stirring in the rough , firm sides . He opened his hands and the fish swam free , a gray-pink shadow now reclaimed by the grass . <p> The fisherman wiped his hands and stood . He had fished the wild rainbows of Alaska and the bonefish of the Bahamas . The world of fly fishing had shown him its best . He looked up with a secret smile . <p> Down the flat , another golden chance cut the green water that he knew so well . The old salt turned , facing this fresh opportunity with the long rod . <p> Once more amid October 's open promise , something old and something new .
