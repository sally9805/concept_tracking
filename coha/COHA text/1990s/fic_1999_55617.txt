WHEN YOU LIVE ON THE ROAD and off your wits , it 's sound policy to slow down once in a while , and even to come to a stop , albeit temporarily and by way of contrast with the highway flow . ( In my pre-road life it never would have occurred to me to use the word albeit in a sentence . ) Janice and I had been rolling for a long time . I should have suspected something in the nature of a challenge when she quizzed me for the most unlikely name for a commercial establishment I could come up with . What would you have said ? Uncle Joe 's Old-Time Communist Nostalgia Bar is what I said . <p> " You do n't want to make it easy on me , do you , Eugene ? " <p> " You would n't respect me if I made it easy on you . " <p> This exchange took place as Janice downshifted her way into a small city on the shore of a touristified lake in the Michigan woods . For reasons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As we crossed the city line , their obnoxious sign prickled at me : Welcome to Cherry Center : It 's the Pits ! Cutesy , in my opinion , is a whole lot of what 's wrong with this country . Read a little history and you 'll realize that empires have been brought down by just that kind of simpering excess . <p> You 'd have no reason to know what was lurking between our laconic lines , so let me see if I can summarize it in a way that wo n't bore you : A couple years ago , Janice and I walked away from our separate lives of shuffling routine in Niagara Falls , the geographically noteworthy city in which we both grew up . I was a pharmacist , she was a physical therapist . Having reached our forties , we 'd both endured our quota of tribulations and disappointment , of course , but in leaving the Falls we were not so much escaping from unsatisfactory lives as setting out to uncover a new life together , and we knew it . The distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the obstacle you might think . Circumstances can be taken advantage of : wigs and makeup , all-night convenience stores , aseptic bars full of lonely people ; there 's no limit to the cornucopia of possibility that these United States hold in their broad and fecund lap . What 's more , people tend to be generous when they are nudged into a position from which giving feels like getting . If you know where to shake the tree , money tumbles down like autumn leaves , except that the sound it makes plunking suggests life and renewal , not death and decay . <p> I 'd say the life into which we motored was like a dream , but no dream ever glissaded so smoothly across the surface of the real world . No dream ever provided quite the tactile fillip of pleasure when you reached out and stroked its mysterious face . Which is not to say there was no tension inside the series of high-performance automobiles that became our home away from home . ( We were driving a dark-blue Porsche at the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudice against foreign-made automobiles . ) <p> The tension lived inside our relationship . Janice was the creative half of the duo , and like all imaginative individuals she was inveterately restless , constantly on the lookout for the new , the novel , the untested edge against which to throw herself . Naturally I fretted , prey to a suspicion that sooner or later the woman I loved was going to tire of her long ride with me . But the harder Janice tried to allay my anxiety , the worse it got . What saved me was knowing how important it was to stay interesting to her . Chronic anxiety is anything but interesting . <p> " How much you want to bet this town is full of registered Republicans ? " she said as we tooled slowly down the main street , which was called Main Street , where American flag motifs alternated with the endless icons of cherries on which the inhabitants appeared to thrive : pictures of cherry blossoms and trees and of the fruit itself , painted on wood and embossed on metal and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of macrame . <p> " Since when did you care about party politics , Janice ? " <p> " I like it , " she decided , nodding sociably to a jolly-faced man in a pickup truck who pulled up next to us at a stoplight , resting his belly on the steering wheel . " You know what it feels like ? " <p> What it felt like was home , so we took a comfortable room at Will Ray 's Walnut Lodge on Cherry Center 's northern verge . Will was an enviably flat-bellied man of fifty who talked with his hands , except when they were in his pockets checking for quarters . He was born Raymond Will III , changing his name after a never-quite-cleared-up falling-out with his father . Half of Cherry Center called him Will , the other half called him Ray , and neither half knew for sure whether they were addressing him by his first name or his surname . Will 's wife ( her name was never mentioned ) had left him for a huckster of some sort , so Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I had devised over a long weekend in Cleveland when we were bored and felt the need to organize the American population into recognizable archetypes . <p> " First one of the evening is on the house , " Will told us in the walnut-paneled bar to which he escorted us after checking us in . " Got to treat you right , because we do n't get too many paying customers after about the middle of September . " <p> " That 's about to change , " Janice told him , and I knew we were on our way . I experienced what I had begun to refer to as the deep tickle , a piercing sensation of pleasurable-painful expectation that sliced my quick whenever Janice made up her mind to chance a new caper . <p> " Come again ? " said Will . He was halfway through mixing Janice a Singapore Sling , which I swear she ordered just to prove there was such a drink . Will was a born bartender . He consulted no book . Whether the colorful concoction he served my lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the taste matched Janice 's hopes for the name , and for some reason I enjoyed watching Will 's cheeks inflate as he watched her sip . So much pleasure is there for the taking , this road gig has taught me , from life 's tiny creases , the mini-fissures into which we all ought to stick our tongues more often . Is that too obscure ? I think it need n't be , but I have made a private vow not to devolve into some sort of roadside preacher . <p> So . <p> We were the only customers in the bar . Janice had full free scope to work up our plan for the benefit of Will , who listened with his hands as well as he spoke with them . I admired him for not saying an immediate no . <p> " You wo n't find many around here who ever voted communist , " is all he said . <p> " That 's not the point , " Janice pointed out . <p> " Nostalgia , " said Will , and she nodded companionably into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumed . <p> " You should try one of these , Eugene , " she suggested , but I stuck to my gin and bitters , a drink I learned about from a spy novel back when I required escapism to stay entertained . <p> " Might be interesting to see if you can pull it off , " Will said , " but I for one would n't put a nickel into it . " <p> " Of course you would n't . " <p> " You want another Singapore Sling ? " <p> " If you can make it taste like the first one . You put your finger on it , you know . " <p> " On what ? " <p> " The operative word is nostalgia . Think of nostalgia as a commodity . " <p> " You mean a product . " <p> " OK , a product . It happens to be a product for which there is a virtually unlimited demand , as it happens . Look at the ' 60s . " <p> " I was there . It was n't all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All I 'm saying is nostalgia is a product , the same way steel and wheat and computer chips are products . " <p> It was clear from the outset that we liked each other , Will and Janice and I. We trusted one another . We enjoyed each other 's company . So it was only natural to turn to Will for advice about a suitable property for the bar . And natural for him to act as go-between with the owner , a retired cherry farmer living on a houseboat off the Gulf Coast of Florida . And , I suppose , it was also natural for Will to change his mind about putting money into the project . Good thing he did , because it took all the cash Janice and I had stashed to make it look real on our part . <p> When Janice focuses on a goal , events happen at time-warp speed , whatever that means . In any event , Uncle Joe 's Old-Time Communist Nostalgia Bar opened its swinging doors to the public over Thanksgiving weekend , when we hoped a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had spent scarce cash to advertise in the papers in Detroit and Flint and Pontiac and Grand Rapids . And under Janice 's savvy tutelage , we had not stinted on decor . <p> There were framed portraits of Lenin and Stalin and Marx and even Trotsky . The restroom walls were papered with the Communist Manifesto , along with salient pages from Das Kapital . The big-screen television continuously recycled an amazing array of video material : footage from all the famous Soviet events , the Red Square May Day Parade , the Russians turning back the Nazis , Khrushchev pounding his well-known shoe on the United Nations table , JFK solemnly warning against missiles in Cuba . It was all there , a compressed history in images of one of the century 's great ideological and political and social experiments . <p> We were disappointed with our opening weekend . A few Cherry Centerians came by to gawk and make rude jokes and give Will a hard time . ( There had been talk about a legal challenge by the local chapter of the Young Republicans as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) But having been tempered in the fire of small-town peer pressure when his wife abandoned him for a man who reportedly sold sexual stimulants door to door , Will knew what to say when his neighbors gave him grief . <p> " So what do you say ? " I asked him . <p> " I say who the hell else around here is putting money into something that 's going to bring tourists to this godforsaken place in winter ? Godforsaken in winter , that is . In the summer it 's nice enough . " <p> The locals ' reaction did not surprise us . But our collective heart was broken by the paltry return we made on our investment in advertising . Through the four-day weekend a handful of people came in , ordered a drink , looked around at the decor , and wiped their mouths with the backs of their hands . I did n't ask , but I was pretty sure none of them had driven north because of the tantalizing promise of Janice 's ad copy . <p> " Screw it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " You want out ? " Janice asked . " It 's a wacky concept , I know that . Eugene and I have talked it over , and we 'll be happy to buy your half from you , Will . " <p> I held my breath , because at that particular juncture in the adventure , Janice and I could n't have made a down payment on a loaf of bread . But there was no need to panic . Janice never opened her mouth to make an offer like that unless she was absolutely certain she was going to be turned down . <p> " Screw it , " said Will , by which we understood him to mean that he was in for the duration . <p> The duration , as it turned out , did not take long to congeal . We were lucky : I admit that . Unless you say ( as I am tempted to ) that one makes his own luck . That events are neutral , the world her cruel self indifferent , and it 's what a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outcome we agree to call luck only by convention . Luck is only shorthand for the complicated mysteries that bind people and the things they do , the things that happen to them , in a web of startling happenstance . <p> Except I promised not to proselytize . <p> So call it dumb luck that ten members of a nearby crafts commune traveling in a van had a fiat tire outside Uncle Joe 's . And came in to use the phone when they found they had no spare . And stayed . And loved it . And dumb , ducky luck also that the founders of the commune happened to be trust-fund babies from Grosse Pointe , and they got such a kick out of the idea of a place like ours that they invited their more worldly family members up for the next weekend . And they came . <p> And kept coming . I knew we were over the hump when a brooding red-haired woman with an abnormally large forehead and probing green eyes interviewed Janice and Will for the Detroit Free Press . Uncle Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It was Will 's idea to name drinks after notable communists . Janice encouraged him . She knew how to get the best out of people . So she directed him to the local library , where he read up on his subject and came back with a legal-pad page full of evocative names like the Fred Engels Molotov Cocktail , the Karl Marx Sour , and the Bakunin Double Bitters . I myself came up with Commie Costume Night , when people were invited to come dressed as their favorite historical figure . We saw all too many Che Guevaras for my taste , and more than enough Fidels and Marxes , but the event was a moneymaker . <p> " So you did it , " I said to Janice one night as we got ready for bed . <p> We continued to live at the Walnut Lodge . Will gave us a very friendly rate , but we all thought it was healthy for the relationship to keep on paying . I lay in bed watching Janice peel layers of winter clothing  --  than which there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out from under all that shape-obscuring wool , those folds and lumps of fabric , came a glowing body with a unique pear shape . Janice is bulbous-butted , a definite plus . And her ruddy winter skin radiated health and vigor . She unhooked a bra with tiny daisies imprinted on a pale-blue background . The air was nippy ; we had left a window open . Her lovely purple nipples stood up in what a scholar of such marvels might call bas-relief . <p> " We did it , you mean , " she corrected . " Uncle Joe 's would not have worked without all of us contributing . You know that , Eugene . " <p> " I never saw that bra before , " I said as she tossed it over a chair back . I knew I was making a mistake , but since when did knowing something was wrong stop a person from doing it ? <p> " Sure you have . " <p> " I 'd remember . " <p> " Maybe you have n't been looking . " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply , folded her arms across her breasts , which bulged attractively . " So what 's your subtext ? " <p> " All I 'm saying , " I began , but she shushed me with a wave of her hand . <p> " Whenever anybody starts a sentence like that , you know it 's never all they 're saying . " <p> I took a deep breath . I plunged . My eyes were open . " I 'm jealous of Will Ray . " <p> She laughed . Not as heartily as I would have liked , but she was still able to communicate the groundless absurdity of my worry . " He 's an Only the Lonely . He needs a listening ear , and someone to light his cigarette for him once in a while . We need Will , you know . If he was n't around to pacify the local masses , they 'd probably be voting right now to run us out of town on a rail . " <p> " I 'm starting to bore you , am I not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried , Eugene . " <p> That was when I really began to worry . Funny how our lovemaking reached its highest peaks during my lowest periods , the time I spent slogging through the dark valley of insecurity , but that 's the way it worked . She floated to me on a cloud of desire , and we came clean . <p> Not that superior sex fixed anything that needed fixing . The better things went at the bar , the worse I felt . Janice overdid the positive reinforcement , in my opinion , the way she made such a big deal out of Will 's suggestion that we host ideological debates on Thursday and Friday nights . It was a good idea , granted , and it brought in some new faces , including a Marxist professor of something I 'd never heard of at Central Michigan University , who took the whole thing more seriously than it was meant to be taken . But the fact was inescapable : the debates were a hit . <p> You could come primed with your own argument and challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone up on items like the Trotsky-Lenin schism , or the role of the Soviet Union in liberating Africa from the vestiges of European colonialism , or any of a dozen similarly worn-out themes . Judging was democratic and without mercy . The crowd ruled . You got in your licks , took what was coming to you , and scored ( or failed to score ) on points . Drink consumption during the debates set an all-time high . <p> Once , I caught Janice and Will at it in the bar . Debating , that is . Will was trying to convince her that Solzhenitsyn lost his credibility the day he moved to Vermont and began launching tirades against Western materialism , but Janice rebuffed him , point by labored point . Her performance was effortless and full of grace , and Will sat in awe of her power , her poise , her command of the facts . She was n't even really trying . I happened to come in at the moment when he laid one voluble hand over hers on the table , under whose glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had designed the collage myself . <p> " You know , Eugene , you 're one mighty lucky hombre , " Will told me , making a manly effort not to look as though he 'd been caught at anything doubtful . He left his hand resting brazenly on Janice 's . She sat across from him unperturbed , emitting invisible aura gases that held us both in the same drugged condition of thrall . <p> " I know that , Will . Did you count tonight 's take ? " <p> " The take ? " he said vaguely . <p> " It 's been taken , " Janice said . <p> " Taken , " I echoed . <p> " I already took the take , " said Will . " Out of the register , that is . " <p> " We 're doing real well , judging from the take , " Janice observed . <p> " What 's your subtext , Janice ? " I asked her . Yes . I wanted to be brutal and lacerating . <p> She looked at me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I wished , for a regrettable moment , that I had found them in a serious clinch , a position of compromise about which I could reasonably rave . I felt my self-control crumble into pieces too tiny to be reassembled by the most patient effort . <p> " I 'm going to bed , " I informed my partners . <p> " To bed , " they said in offensive stereo . <p> The coincidence of sound brought Janice back to her natural state of alertness . She blinked , owl-like , and told me , " I 'll be up in a minute . " <p> I 'd like to say that I pulled it back together . But I did n't . <p> " Mary Magdalene , " Janice told me when she came to bed . <p> " What about her ? " <p> " That 's the name of Will 's ex-wife . He just confided that to me . Can you imagine being saddled with a name like Mary Magdalene ? What kind of parents do you figure she had , some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept with him yet ? " <p> " Slept with whom ? " <p> " Do n't evade the question . " <p> " No . " <p> " But you want to . You 're thinking about it , are n't you ? " <p> " All I 'm thinking is I should maybe take back what I said about your not being able to bore me even if you tried . " <p> That sort of back-and-forth usually wound up in our making energetic love , and that night was no exception . I fell asleep in a condition of fulfilled blankness I suspect many stress-burdened Americans would kill to attain . And I woke resolved to obliterate my jealousy by sheer effort of will . But I did n't have time to worry about either my shortcomings or Janice 's dangerous need for the novel , because Uncle Joe 's Old-Time Communist Nostalgia Bar had problems . <p> I blame it on Will 's lovestruck condition that he did n't see it coming . He thought he had the Cherry Center crowd becalmed , or at least on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truism that when business was good for us it was also good for them . And it was . The bar was bringing in winter tourists who would never have come without the inducement of communist nostalgia . However , contrary to that old canard about the economic underpinnings of all social struggle , what threatened our well-being in Cherry Center was purely political in nature . And with Will mooning about , brandishing the face of an idiot calf , in love and in lust with Janice and unable to distinguish between the two , well , we were blindsided . <p> People like you and me would have no reason even to think about an organization like the Northern Michigan/Lower Peninsula Freedom Guardians . Sounds like a joke , does n't it ? It was no joke . And the NM/ LP-FG did n't find the idea of a communist nostalgia bar in their home precinct very funny , either . Too many Americans have died in trenches and rice paddies , they 'd been going around saying , to make a laughingstock out of the Michigan way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etymology of the word laughingstock ? " Janice asked me . " I wish we had one of those books that tell you the history of curious words . I have this image of a hilarious Pilgrim in an ox yoke . " <p> " They 're a bunch of hotheads is all , " was Will 's opinion . It was closing time at Uncle Joe 's . We had coaxed into being our own little tradition whereby the three of us sat around a table over one slow , chatty drink before making the trek back to the lodge . " It 'll pass . Watch , next week they 'll be writing letters to the editor about getting the Panama Canal back from the wetbacks Carter sold it to . " <p> " When there 's no enemy visible outside the gates , " Janice told us both , " the populace starts to look for the enemy within . " <p> Will looked at her in witless , worshipful wonder , an attitude that would have irked me if I had n't been preoccupied with the NM/LPFG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far too lightly , I thought . <p> It turned out I was right , slim consolation though it be . Bad things started happening . First , someone threw a bagful of cow manure at the front door . ( I was the one to clean it off , which may be why I took the shit so personally . ) The night after that , someone fired a .22 rifle from a passing pickup . The slug drilled an almost perfectly round hole in our front window , in the circle of the " o " of the word Communist , which we had painted on ourselves . <p> " They 're just having fun , " Will told us . " They 're creeps , I 'll grant you that , but they 're only having fun . " <p> Some fun , I held myself back from saying . Things were highly tense between Will and me by that point . Every time I crossed his field of vision , his body performed a jerking double-take motion that expressed his guilt , which lent credence to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Janice had n't said yes to him yet , he lived in a fever of hope that I suppose was singularly pleasurable for a man in his position . <p> Unpleasant things kept happening . Hate mail was stuffed in our box . The air was let out of all four tires on Will 's brand-new Ford Explorer . Women and children sniffed histrionically when they passed us in the street . Then the Guardians got smart . After several weeks of harmless silliness , they went for us where it hurt . <p> " Picketing is protected by the Constitution , " was Janice 's only remark when a herd of militants showed up with placards from which the slogans fairly screamed . ( Nyet to Commies  --  Back to Russia Now was the one that appealed to me most , by virtue of its austere simplicity . ) We peered at them through the slats of a Venetian blind . In hunting jackets and large , bright hats , they looked like a convention of disappointed deer hunters . <p> " What about disturbing the peace ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry in earnest . <p> " What about making it impossible for paying customers to come into our bar ? " I said , watching a bulky man perform threatening hand gestures in our direction . I did n't mind their native conservatism , much , and most days I would n't mind their organizational zeal . What stuck in my craw was their smallness . They were a meanspirited crew , unwilling to imagine a way of life not their own . <p> " How are groups like these organized ? " Janice asked Will . " Do they have officers , or boards of directors , or what ? " <p> The question meant she was working on a solution , knowing which should have relieved my mind but did n't . The reason it did n't was Will . He was no longer able to disguise the lustful tremor in his limbs when he was around Janice . The sheepish , apologetic way he looked at me was driving me around the bend . <p> What the Freedom Guardians wanted , they got . Customers quit coming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braving the unruly picket line of NM/LP-FG members , who worked shifts to dissuade people from entering Uncle Joe 's . <p> " What about our legal rights ? " Janice asked Will in frustration one afternoon . " You know the sheriff , you know the judge . Where are they in all this ? What are they doing to protect us ? " <p> He shrugged . " Way of the world , Janice . Nobody wants to be a hero . " <p> She shook her head as if in answer to a question she had posed to herself , and that afternoon neither Will nor I could prevent her from going out to confront the protesters . Except that confront was not exactly what she did . From inside the bar , we watched the woman we both loved as she struck up a conversation with a slim , slight man in old-fashioned black spectacles who seemed to hold a position of authority . We watched her drive away with him in his fire-engine-red Bronco . A half-hour later , we watched the Bronco return . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We watched him shake Janice 's hand with a vigor that could only signify respect . And we watched the almost maidenly modesty with which she crossed the quickly emptying parking lot and came back inside . <p> " For crying out loud , what did you tell that beaverhead ? " Will said . I was afraid he was going to fall on his knees and kiss her feet , an action of praise only I was authorized to carry out . <p> " Do me a favor , will you , Will ? " <p> " You name it . " <p> " Fix me a Singapore Sling . " <p> I knew from experience that Janice was n't about to let us know what had transpired between her and the senior leadership of the NM/LP-FG , so I let it go , and eventually Will figured out that letting it go was all he could do , too . <p> It did n't take long for business to pick up again . In fact , once the picket line disappeared , the notoriety actually improved our cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick drink . We were making good fast on our investment . Uncle Joe 's was a hot hit in the cold Michigan winter . <p> So why did I separate my clothes from Janice 's , pack one of our two suitcases , and drive away from Cherry Center alone in the blue Porsche ? Because of a certain way that Janice began walking  --  treading , really . Her movements were not surreptitious , nor did they suggest complicity , exactly . But there was a spring in her step that terrified me when it was combined with a pneumatic sheen on her skin . Do what she might , at the slightest provocation her mouth formed a small " o " of wonderment , as if to say that life was indeed a rich stew , a feast of promise , for the person who knew how to eat . I knew something splendid was over . <p> I also knew that she would not begrudge me the car , so I left without saying good-bye . I did n't hate Will Ray the way you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men like Will and myself were mere sticks in the violent wind she blew . Good-bye , I said aloud as I turned the key in the ignition , meaning Good-bye . <p> It was early on a slate-gray morning , a fine corn snow sifting from the sky . I drove carefully , having no desire to slide the Porsche into a ditch anywhere in the vicinity of Cherry Center , Michigan . So I was surprised when the state cop came up behind me with siren and flasher going . I coasted to a stop on the snowy berm . <p> " This your car ? " he asked . If , as some contend , everybody on earth resembles one or another animal , the officer who pulled me over was a wolverine , which made sense in that state , I guess . His feral eyes scanned my face for signs of dissembling . <p> The Porsche was my car . From a certain point of view . Or if possession really was nine-tenths of the law . Janice and I had acquired it in Indiana under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered it to be my car , so I told the officer it was . <p> " License and registration , " he commanded , making me nervous enough that I did n't notice Janice slipping in next to me until she was there . <p> " Thank you , officer , " she told the cop , who gave my papers a cursory look , tipped his hat , and plodded back to his car . <p> " What did you tell him to make him bring you out here ? " I said . I was feeling peeved , which was a much safer emotion than the exuberant joy I knew I was going to be feeling any second . <p> She shook her head . " The motions of the human heart are passing strange , Eugene . " " How so ? " <p> I was back on the highway , driving a little faster now . The snow made a comfortable blur . <p> " When I realized you were willing to leave me , it made me start loving you again . I knew I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you escape , it was going to be like ... I do n't know , maybe like starting a game of Monopoly and not playing until I bankrupted you . " <p> She clamped a physical therapist 's trained hand on my leg , and my whole body went blotto . ( When they teach teenagers to drive , I hope they instruct them in the blotto phenomenon ; the highways are treacherous enough as it is . ) <p> " Will you tell me one thing ? " I could n't help asking . <p> " Not if it 's what I think you 're going to ask . " <p> " Just tell me how you got the Freedom Guardians to ease up on us . " <p> " By telling them the truth . " <p> " Which truth ? " <p> " That Uncle Joe 's is an undercover operation . " <p> " Undercovering what ? " <p> " Recalcitrant communists . Enemies of democracy . Retrograde authoritarians . People who want to spoil the good thing America has going . " <p> I was skeptical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " The government , " she told me with just a hint of impatience , " is a large part of the problem . They 're riddled with reactionaries . They want to bring back the Cold War because it 's good for their budgets . " <p> " Then who 's doing the undercover operation at Uncle Joe 's ? " <p> " Friends , " she said obliquely . " Friends of democracy . " <p> " I do n't follow you . " <p> " You do n't have to . But the Guardians did , and that 's what counts . So , which way are we heading , Eugene ? I 'm ready for a change . " <p> " South , " I said , making up my mind on the spot . " Someplace where there 's Spanish moss and palm trees and anybody who 's anybody plays the maracas . " <p> " That 's a long way . Did I tell you I sold our half of Uncle Joe 's to Will Ray ? I did n't get what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> It was time to test her . " Let 's play a game . I give you a word , you give me the meaning . " <p> " What 's your first word ? " <p> My first word was love , but I held that one back . Suffragette was the one I gave her . <p> " An airplane with a bad conscience . " <p> The speed of her response put me at ease . A disordered world was returning to its rightful position , in which Janice reigned as good queen of all compass points . We drove through the snow , which fell like perfect discretion . A less experienced lover would have brought Will Ray into the conversation , would have insisted on knowing . On knowing what ? That Janice is an awesome woman at the height of her manifold powers ? I knew enough , and that was too much . <p> " South , " said Janice reflectively , and I shivered . <p> <p> By MARK JACOBS <p>          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
