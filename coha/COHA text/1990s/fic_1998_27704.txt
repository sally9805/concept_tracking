THE TRAIN from the country had been late , and the progress of the crowded streetcar was maddeningly slow , traffic being busy and the horses decrepit . The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals kept special watch on the street railway lines , but the sad pair pulling our car had escaped their vigilance . As we rattled through the press of trolleys , delivery wagons , omnibuses , and dashing pedestrians , I was repeatedly jostled against my neighbor on the overhead strap ; he had had garlic for supper . When , at last , I got off the streetcar , I still had a short distance to walk to reach the Delaware River piers . It was an area of wholesalers -- teas , candles and lard oil , spices , wool -- but I passed a few shopfronts , too , all closed for the night , their window displays only dimly visible in the light from the street-lamps . A dry goods window caught my eye nevertheless and was cunningly enough done to make me stop and study it a moment , late as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fabrics , with folds of green and brown tarlatans for woodlands , hills of tulle , a blue satin river , and pale linens and muslins shirred into fields of spring growth . Mr. Edwin would have appreciated it . When Isabelle and I cleared out his desk , we found a leatherette box of sketches for merchandise displays , though none as fanciful as the fabric landscape . There was nothing particularly private about those sketches , nor about anything else in Mr. Edwin 's desk , but I did n't like emptying the drawers . I 'd never had anything to do with the desk before , except to dust its surface , and there I was throwing away worn-down gum erasers and pen nibs , and his calendar diary and reading spectacles . It did n't help that it was all under Isabelle 's supervision . I felt the same when she had me clear away other things that could n't be sent to charity , like his shaving brush with its splayed bristles and the half-used bowl of shaving soap , and a dressing gown he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraying again . It 's things like that -- ordinary things that show the wear of common use -- that bring home to you that someone is really gone . I sensed the presence of the river before I reached it . Of course , I knew it was there ; I had lived quite near it for a year . But it was more than plain familiarity with the river 's existence that informed me . There was a difference to the atmosphere , a coolness apart from the winter evening 's chill , like a bassoon behind violins . There was , too , an opening up of space , a feeling that some large edge was close at hand . Lights were fewer ahead ; sounds broke up , spread out , and died thin . Perhaps , however , it was only my state of mind that made the approach to the river so suggestive . Isabelle Martin awaited me there , and the course our meeting might take was anything but clear . I could have said the " notorious " Isabelle Martin , for she had been called that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair , there were those as well that called her better things , like tender and diligent . ) It was her house near the river in which I 'd lived that year , hers and her husband 's . And more passed there for all three of us than some folks meet in the full of their lives . For though everyone encounters death somewhere along their way , few are acquainted with murder , and fewer still accused of it . THEY TALK about the pursuit of happiness in the Declaration of Independence , but when was it people really started expecting that they ought to be happy ? When was it they started thinking it was all right to do whatever it took to get personal happiness ? It must have begun sometime while I was a child , for I know my parents never had such a notion , nor my grandparents , and yet , when I was grown , there it was , showing its face with greater and greater boldness in more and more places . Isabelle Martin certainly considered she had a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure enough to use whatever came her way , including me . I remember her clearly on that last night in 1887 , waiting on the pier at Philadelphia 's waterfront , ready to set sail for a new life . She was going to France to revisit the places of her childhood , and then someplace else , where , I did not want to know . I had asked her not to tell me , and she had agreed to my request without question . Isabelle 's slight figure seemed even smaller in the shadow of the great ship , yet she stood straight and still , looking calmly out across the harbor as if she were viewing a rose garden on a fine summer 's day . While I shivered despite my thick wool shawl , Isabelle , in her trim silk traveling suit , seemed not to feel the dampness in the fog curling around us carrying with it smells of wet rope , decaying fish , and sewage . Other passengers bustled past us , porters behind them dragging trunks on wheeled carts or hoisting cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strode noisily by on their way south to the alehouses and oyster bars on Water Street ; they eyed us openly , made curious by two lone women standing wordlessly and without apparent purpose . But Isabelle ignored the staring sailors and the busy travelers and porters forced to detour around us . I 'd wondered , at first , why she wanted me to see her off . But when I saw her so serene in the misted darkness , I knew . She wanted to show me she believed she had been right , that her conscience was clear . I also knew , as cold water seeped through the soles of my thin shoes , that I had come because I wished to see just that which she desired to show . I wanted to witness Isabelle Martin on the verge of what she expected to be a happy life at last , if only to observe closely again her fierce impulse toward happiness , for though I was only a servant girl of twenty-four , it seemed to me that this was an impulse that would mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , and that it deserved careful watching .
