<p> " My souls ( or characters ) are agglomerations of past and present cultures , scraps from books and newspapers , fragments of humanity , torn shreds of once-fine clothing that has become rags , in just the way that a human soul is patched together . " <p> August Strindberg , 1888 <p> I FOUND THESE WORDS WHILE I was searching for language that lived as literature , then hurtled past literature to live as theater . The words are n't even from one of Strindberg 's plays ; they 're from the preface he wrote for " Miss Julie . " But they take hold of us right away , just as that harrowing play and its equally harrowing predecessor , " The Father , " do . <p> " The Father " is playing at the Roundabout Theater Company mainstage ( it is right next door to Brian Friel 's " Molly Sweeney " ) . Call it the dismemberment of every piety ever hung round the sanctity of Motherhood and Fatherhood ; call it a revenge tragedy in the guise of a domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that litter the stage at the play 's end ) ; call it a vision of every life-and-death struggle  --  sexual , social , cultural , economic  --  that has ever taken place between men and women . <p> " O horrible , O horrible , most horrible ! , " cried one critic at its Swedish premiere in 1888 ( how apt that he should quote Hamlet , a son aghast at parental crimes ) . And 23 years later , in 1911 , an English newspaper sputtered about another production , " Why use the theater for unrelieved depression and brutal aspects of human nature and relationships exploited in the name of art ? " <p> We know the brutal aspects of human nature and relationships from studying our history and from living our lives day by day . We 're obsessed with them , so to see them on a stage , potent and eloquent but with the protective coloration that the past always supplies , is astonishingly cathartic . <p> No , it could have been cathartic , but it was n't . This is a messy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful and continually frustrating . <p> The Father is an army captain , an educated man who has risen above his profession to become a scientist . He studies meteorites , but he is fast sinking into delusions and obsessions about biology and destiny . He and his wife , Laura , were once in thrall to each other ; now they are in combat over the future of their daughter : shall she leave home , live with friends of her father 's and be trained as a teacher , or stay home with her mother and study to become a painter ? She is their pawn , and her actual future matters less than their fiercely disputed right to control it . <p> The captain uses his economic and legal powers . His wife uses the sanctioned weapons of Victorian womanhood : piety , persuasion , strategic passivity and manipulation . Finally , she turns his own chief obsession against him : his rage and terror at the fact that when it comes to the question of paternity , a man must take a woman 's word that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tormented genius and at times a madman . His life was a series of intellectual and emotional battles about science , politics , religion and philosophy . He constantly denounced feminism , but when he wrote plays , he was too brutally honest not to depict the conditions that made feminism- I would say right and necessary , Strindberg would say inevitable and terrible . In the end , both Laura and the captain are bitter , ruthless and monstrous . And despite the extremity of their combat and their fate , they are monstrously familiar . <p> It is amazing how a strong play can manage to make itself heard above the clamor of a dismal production . But it is infuriating too . Granted , this " Father " had its backstage troubles : the original director , Robert Falls , left just as rehearsals began and , from all appearances , his replacement , Clifford Williams , has been able to do very little but see that the actors knew their lines and their blocking . ( The blocking is a close call and , besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set is perfectly respectable , but only Richard Nelson 's lean adaptation and Kenneth Posner 's lighting show consistent care . <p> Frank Langella does make a gripping Father . You feel the clash of his rigor and intelligence , his anguish and cruelty , his bigotry , his dignity , his hysteria , his capacity for suffering and for making others suffer . But this is an eight-character play , not a one-man soliloquy . The other leading character , the mother , must in her own subtle way be just as formidable as the man who has become her mortal enemy . Gail Strickland has been cast in a role beyond her means and wholly out of her depth . When she can be heard , her words do n't matter , when she moves she is dutiful , and when she is still she is lifeless . <p> In the supporting roles ( the daughter , a nurse , a local doctor , a pastor and two orderlies ) , the actors range from decent enough but badly directed to well meaning but miscast . I hope Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to imagine under what conditions a leading actor would agree to be so weakly supported , and just as hard to imagine why directors and producers would allow it . <p> The Roundabout Theater Company confounds me utterly . Take this season and last : when they do fine plays like " The Father , " " A Month in the Country " or " The Moliere Plays " on their mainstage , they mute or muddy them with uneven casting and directing . Though I did n't care for " A Month in the Country , " it was n't as slovenly as " The Father " is . And though " The Moliere Plays " certainly revolved around the ruling planet of their star , Brian Bedford , they did n't do so shamefully , as " The Father " does . <p> When the Roundabout turns to living playwrights it chooses some of their weakest work . Why mount a bad play by Harold Pinter and a tastefully dreary one by Brian Friel ? At this rate , the company is in danger of becoming the theatrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they do n't notice  --  or care  --  if the work 's not good . <p> This is not how institutions attract new audiences in the long run . The Roundabout could put more care and resourceful concern into the quality of its revivals . It could revive works by a much broader variety of living playwrights : venerables like Edward Albee , August Wilson , Caryl Churchill , Imamu Baraka and David Mamet , as well as produce new works by writers like Christopher Durang , Beth Henley , Eduardo Machado and Donald Margulies . Reviving the 1970 's musical " Company " was a fine idea , but the production did n't find a way to bridge the gap between Stephen Sondheim 's truly fpesh score and George Furth 's no longer fresh book . <p> In the meantime , what a waste of this extraordinary play . And what a wasted opportunity for the Roundabout too . " The Father " ends its run next month , but a good production might have been able to move to another theater . It might have drawn ( it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it wo n't and it should n't . ' The Universe ' <p> I would like to see Richard Foreman direct " The Father " one day . ( And while we 're on the subject of recently botched revivals , Mr. Foreman has said he 'd like to direct the Jule Styne musical " Gentlemen Prefer Blondes . " I 'd like to see that too . ) He has his own theater  --  he calls it the Ontological-Hysteric  --  and for 25 years now he has written , designed and directed his own plays : short , stern , ominously slapstick inquiries into the contradictory meanings of life and death and into the varied uses to which art , philosophy and passion ( intellectual and sexual ) might be put . His play titles sound like cartoon captions : " Eddie Goes to Poetry City " ; " My Head Was a Sledgehammer " ; " I 've Got the Shakes . " <p> He calls his current play at St. Mark 's Church " The Universe ( I.E. : How It Works ) . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maze where words , actions and feelings are cross-wired and short-circuited . <p> His people are nervous , driven and fractured : " Since they are modern characters , living in an age of transition more urgently hysterical at any rate than the age which preceded it , I have drawn my people as split and vacillating , a mixture of the old and the new . " Actually , these words are Strindberg 's , but they apply uncannily well to Mr. Foreman . <p> Mr. Foreman 's settings are the visual analogue of a feverishly driven image-racked mind . They are filled with objects : Oriental carpets , religious paintings , black-and-white tiles , fake pearl chandeliers , mirrors , folding screens , tablep , chairs , dishes , cutlery and old records that line the walls like fetish objects . We hear musical phrases repeating themselves compulsively  --  a boogie-woogie vamp , a lush big-band riff , a march , all interrupted by buzzers , ominous thunder and lugubrious organ notes . Kitchen pot tops crashed together serve as percussion . It could be a silent-movie score . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very old silent movie and the jerky plottings of a science-fiction tale . There is an intense austere man named James ( played by James Urbaniak ) . James is shadowed by a jauntily menacing older man who seems more demonic than human ( Tony Torn in a curly white Sun King wig ) . And he is haunted by a spirited young woman named Mary ( played with perfect , slightly imperious wit by Mary McBride , dressed in black with high-heeled white sneakers ) . He is smitten , she is intrigued ; they test and torment each other and themselves ; she withdraws , he regresses ; she teases , he rages ; he dreams of a universe whose laws are utterly different from ours ; she dreams of relocating to " some other one of the millions of millions of planets . . . " <p> Obsession , regression , love , a dream of utter intimacy and of utter solitude : we play these patterns over and over in our lives and in our minds , and that is what Mr. Foreman puts before us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a glasslike wall that reflects images back to us as we watch ourselves watching . ) <p> I always feel imprisoned in a Richard Foreman production . The pace is relentless , his sensibility is insistent , high handed and , even when he 's being very funny , overbearing . But almost against my will I 'm caught up , reluctantly bewitched , as the actors play with gestures , postures , mood swings and genres ( melodrama , slapstick , reverie ) and as the objects around them take on lives and wills of their own . <p> This ability to take you away  --  to kidnap you really  --  from the laws of everyday life is what makes me want to see Mr. Foreman direct Strindberg . He directed a compelling " Threepenny Opera " at the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1976 and he has directed a number of operas too ( Strindberg is operatic ) , including " Die Fledermaus " and " Don Giavanni .
