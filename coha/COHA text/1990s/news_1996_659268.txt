<p> " Ching , ching , ching " went the spurs as they brushed along the wooden sidewalk outside the O.K. Corral . <p> Could mean trouble , Doug Clay thought to himself as he sat behind the desk inside . Trouble had a way of finding the O.K. Corral . <p> The earthy , sweet smell of desert sage blew in as Cecil Frum entered the front office , a sinister presence in his black , silver-studded cowboy hat , black leather vest and cowboy boots . But most menacing of all was the 20-inch Bowie knife and pair of revolvers hanging from his hips . <p> Clay had seen his type before - the steely eyes , the swagger , the attitude . <p> He sized him up in one word : Tourist . <p> This is Tombstone 1996 , where for the last four years it has been legal for folks to walk the streets with real guns strapped to their hips . <p> The statute has n't returned the town to the Wild West days of lawlessness and violence . But , over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " the town too tough to die . " <p> " Give someone a couple of shots of tequila and either you 're Wyatt Earp or they are , " Clay grumbled . <p> Lord knows Clay has seen plenty of wannabe gunslingers with side arms wanting tours of the famous spot immortalized in the movies " Gunfight at the O.K. Corral " and , more recently , " Tombstone " and " Wyatt Earp . " <p> Quite frankly , it 's getting a little old . <p> " I get tired of people coming in here , throwing back their duster , pulling their guns and saying , " ' Ha ha , this is a stick-up , ' " said Clay , who manages the infamous site . " There 's nothing funny about looking down the barrel of a .45 . " <p> Since the law took effect , one young man practicing his fast draw shot off his rear-end . Another man , dressed like a gunslinger , put a gun to a woman 's back in the O.K. Cafe . It was just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , punched him in the belly and pressed charges . <p> Even the stagecoach , which gives 15-minute tours of town , was held up by a drunkard - again , a joke . <p> But Marshal Bobby Gerencser , who considers himself " more as an Andy Griffith than a Wyatt Earp , " finds nothing funny about it . <p> " When they see a police officer in town , they think they can draw down on them like the Wild West , " Gerencser said . " He may think it 's fun and games and draw down on me , and it wo n't be fun and games . When we pull our weapons , we 're pulling them for a reason . " <p> Gerencser 's predecessor , Marshal Virgil Earp and his famous brother , Wyatt , were n't laughing either 115 years ago . In those shoot-'em-up days , cowboys and cattle rustlers were taking over the town . One of them shot Marshal Fred White dead on Allen Street . <p> When Virgil Earp took over as marshal , he passed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits . Cowboys were required to check their guns at their first stop in town , be it a saloon or a barbershop . <p> Defending that law led to the notorious gunfight at the O.K. Corral , a livery stable and corral in town . The Earps and Doc Holliday showed up at the vacant lot next door on Oct. 26 , 1881 , ostensibly to disarm the Clanton and McLaury boys , who were violating the ban . <p> The rest is history . In a 27-second shootout , Billy Clanton and Frank and Tom McLaury fell dead . Wyatt was the only one in the Earp party to escape injury . <p> An article in the Tombstone Epitaph the next day concluded that the shootout should serve as a lesson to " teach the cow-boy element that they can not come into the streets of Tombstone in broad daylight , armed with six-shooters and Henry rifles to hunt down their victims . " <p> The so-called Virgil Earp Law has remained on the books for more than a century , although enforcement waned when the Earps left town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970s , after a Pennsylvania man wearing two pearl-handled revolvers and bandoliers of ammunition crisscrossing his chest called Marshal Gordon Fishler outside for a gunfight . <p> The incident was resolved without gunfire , but the City Council resurrected the Virgil Earp law . <p> In 1991 , three men challenged it , including Jack Fiske , now a 48-year-old bounty hunter . He complained he was being harassed by local police for carrying his guns - loaded or not . Relations got so bad , he said , that police even cited him for not having lights on his horse when he rode home late one night after drinking at Big Nose Kate 's saloon . <p> The National Rifle Association came to his aid and the city backed down . The NRA argued that Arizona state law , which allowed people to openly carry guns without a permit , superseded Tombstone 's ban . <p> Indeed , Arizona is one of 24 states that allow people to openly carry firearms , according to the NRA . <p> Most people in those states do n't exercise the right because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overly advertises the fact , NRA spokeswoman Mary Sue Faulker said . <p> However , 31 states , including Arizona , now have laws allowing people to carry concealed handguns - making them easy to tote in a purse or under a jacket . Concealing a handgun also acts as a deterrent to criminals , Faulker said , because they do n't know who 's armed and who 's not . Only 1 percent to 4 percent of adults exercise that right , she said . <p> Ever since Tombstone repealed the Virgil Earp Law in 1992 , the town has been a mecca for the many modern-day incarnations of Wyatt Earp , Doc Holliday , Billy the Kid and the Clanton boys . <p> Many locals are nervously awaiting tragedy . While they believe in the right to bear arms and own guns themselves , they fear the streets of Tombstone are not the place for them . <p> In fact , one local group , The Vigilantes , no longer performs mock gunfights on Allen Street . They learned their lesson during one show more than a year ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . <p> " ' Look , he 's still breathing , I 'll shoot him , ' " Pete Gomez , a bartender at Legends of the West who watched the incident , remembers the spectator saying . The man was promptly tackled . <p> Ever since , the Vigilantes perform only in an amphitheater - and guns must be checked at the ticket booth . <p> Up until a year ago , Big Nose Kate 's was checking guns , lining them up on a pegboard behind the bar . Some nights , there would be 30 or 40 of them . <p> " Tourists from Michigan would come in and check their guns , just like little kids with plastic guns playing cowboy , " said bartender Mike Heying , who bears a striking resemblance to Buffalo Bill Cody . <p> But Big Nose Kate 's does n't allow guns anymore , and neither do a number of Tombstone businesses , which have posted signs forbidding them on the premises . <p> When tourists come into the O.K. Corral with sidearms - almost a daily occurrence - Clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll call the marshal 's department . If they give me any trouble , I 've got a can of pepper spray behind the counter . " <p> He did n't have to resort to the spray with Cecil Frum , who huffed and grumbled but left , his sword and guns never vacating their holsters . <p> " I could see me living in the old West , " Frum said the next day , strolling through town with his wife and 8-year-old son , also dressed in cowboy attire right down to the spurs . " If there was reincarnation , that 's when I was reincarnated from . " <p> But in this life , Frum lives in Bullhead City , Ariz. , and works as a nurse . <p> " Do n't I look like one ? " he asked , still clad in his black leather vest , hat and boots . <p> His replica Bowie knife remained at his side . But the guns , which he always keeps loaded , were gone . He got tired of being turned away from bars and souvenir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As he and his son walked away , their spurs went " ching , ching , ching " along the boardwalk . The scent of sage still hung in the air . <p> EDITOR 'S NOTE - Julia Prodis is the AP 's Southwest Regional reporter , based in Dallas .
