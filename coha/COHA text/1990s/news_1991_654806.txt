<p> EPITHETS such as " the Rasputin of Lima , " " the power behind the throne , " and " the informal president " are among those applied in recent weeks to Hernando de Soto by Peru 's press and politicians . <p> Many of these Peruvians distrust the influence that Mr. De Soto and his think tank , the Institute of Freedom and Democracy ( ILD ) , have wielded ever since political unknown Alberto Fujimori won the Peruvian presidency in July 1990 . <p> The simmering distrust recently broke out into verbal warfare . De Soto has been obliged to emerge from the shadows to answer often aggressive questions about his role and influence . <p> A rupture with Mr. Fujimori himself seemed inevitable when a key De Soto/ILD project on " the democratization of government decision-making " was radically altered by the Cabinet and officially published in weakened language . De Soto conditioned his continued presidential advisory role on the eventual approval of the original project . <p> It is hard to overestimate the importance of the ILD and De Soto in present-day improvised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Peru has in terms of medium to long-term planning - there simply is nothing else , " says a Western diplomat in Lima . Good contacts De Soto has been the president 's chief negotiator in Peru 's rapidly improved relations with the United States . His personal contacts are excellent : His brother works with United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar , while InterAmerican Bank President Enrique Iglesias and the US Treasury Department 's David Mulford are close friends . <p> The ILD is a nonprofit organization funded by foreign foundations , mainly in the US and Europe , with a large slice coming from the US Agency for International Development . It started quietly in research and investigation , but De Soto burst onto the international scene with his 1986 best-seller " The Other Path , " which is still the ILD bible . <p> In " The Other Path , " De Soto argues that Peru 's informal , underground , or " black " economy is good , more a solution to poverty than a problem . <p> The informals - street sellers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of small illicit workshops - are forced to ply their trade illegally because of government regulations and bureaucracy . They survive through ingenuity and a basic entrepreneurial spirit . This could be harnessed for the national good if such legal essentials as land titles , the right to set up businesses , and access to credit were supplied . Renewed US ties De Soto has been quick to appreciate the need to link bilateral negotiations , including the reestablishment of Peru 's relations with the international financial community , to the US 's number one domestic problem , drugs . <p> The " Fujimori Doctrine , " soon to be enshrined in a new bilateral agreement with the US , is almost pure De Soto . <p> It proposes crop substitution rather than jail terms for coca growers , along with providing land titles and the conditions for a real market economy . And De Soto personally recommended to the president two North American advisers , Ann Wroblewski and Edward Luttwak " to avoid future misunderstandings over development and interdiction , " according to De Soto . <p> New Minister of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Roberto MacLean are both ILD advisers . They use the language of ILD , emphasizing the need for " structural reforms , " a favorite ILD theme . <p> Fujimori 's political rise was nothing short of meteoric . But when he snatched second place behind Mario Vargas Llosa in last April 's round of the presidential elections , he had no program beyond the slogan , " honesty , hard work , technology . " <p> With De Soto 's advice , Fujimori found enough material in ILD ideology to concoct a program between the April elections and the June runoff . <p> Despite its nominal think tank status , ILD is actively involved in institutional reform , from draft law stage through promotion , education , and implementation . It invites popular participation and holds public debates . <p> " Administrative Simplification " - a series of measures cutting through Peru 's notorious red tape - was the first major ILD-prepared law . Peru 's Congress passed it unanimously . Legal registration of a business now takes one day instead of 300 . Complex documentation requirements have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peru-styled free market The concept of a market economy is basic to De Soto 's philosophy . But this means a market economy " made to measure for the people who live in that country ... not a model which looks ideal to foreign investors but which does not encourage popular participation because it was designed in New York , " De Soto says . As evidence , he cites the failure of " the Bolivian model . " <p> Educated in Canada , the US , and Switzerland , De Soto often prefers speaking English to Spanish or French . He first worked as managing director of a Swiss engineering consultancy . Returning to his native Peru in 1979 to run an old mine , he founded the ILD in 1980 , the year Peru returned to democracy after more than a decade of military rule . <p> Although he has been intimately involved in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral organizations on debt and new financing , De Soto believes that most of the reforms Peru needs are internal and structural . Peruvians wrongly tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> De Soto , unlike his critics , has no problem with the ILD 's influential but informal position . <p> " One characteristic of all modern states is that power is not concentrated in ministries , " he says . <p> He believes in specialist " supra-ministerial " bodies such as the proposed Autonomous Alternative Development Authority to coordinate the anti-drugs initiative , and a Hong Kong-style Committee Against Corruption . <p> De Soto has several times refused formally to participate in government . " Those who do perform a great service , but 95 percent of their time is spent putting out fires . They have no chance to create new things as the ILD does . "
