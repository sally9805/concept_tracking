<p> When Saddam Hussein 's army overran Kuwait , the invasion outraged the world , sent oil prices into turmoil - and changed forever the way Southwestern Bell keeps track of fuel costs . <p> Before the Aug. 2 attack , it took up to six weeks for monthly fuel-cost reports to travel from SW Bell 's far-flung divisions to the desk of Michael Herich , manager of the phone company 's fleet of 16,600 cars and trucks . The August report did n't reach Herich until about two weeks ago . These days , with oil prices taking such wild swings , that 's a dangerous way to operate . <p> So , starting this week , Herich will be keeping tabs on companywide fuel costs every two weeks with phone surveys to SW Bell 's divisional offices . <p> Across the country , managers like Herich are getting whiplash just trying to follow the price of oil . One day , prices soar on fear of war ; the next , they plunge on reports that tensions are easing in the Middle East . Oil 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . Every price swing sends thousands of financial wizards scrambling back to their budgetary drawing boards . <p> St. Louis-based SW Bell has learned the hard way how fast its annual fuel bill can change . When crude-oil prices shot up to $ 30 a barrel in September , SW Bell 's estimated annual fuel bill jumped by at least $ 2 million to roughly $ 15 million . Then , oil soared to $ 40 a barrel earlier this month . Had the price stayed there , SW Bell 's annual fuel bill would have jumped another $ 1 million or more . Just when it seemed that sky-high prices were here to stay , oil retreated to the $ 30-a-barrel range . Tuesday , crude oil for December delivery settled at $ 29.37 a barrel . <p> " In today 's market , your position is only as good as the next rumor , " says Doug Standefer , director of trading at Commodity Advisory Corp . of Texas . " When you have a $ 5 ( per-barrel drop ) it completely blows your analysis off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crude plunged more than $ 5 a barrel - its biggest drop ever - on reports that Mohammed appeared to Saddam in a dream , telling him Iraqi missiles were pointed in the wrong direction . That 's not the kind of stuff the Harvard Business School prepares you for . <p> " The worst thing that happens to us is not high prices per se , but volatility , " Bob Baker , American Airlines vice president of operations . <p> The price swings make a huge difference . Movements in world oil markets ripple outward , changing everything from the price of gasoline to the cost of tires to the cost of the plastic that goes into Barbie dolls . <p> Every $ 1-a-barrel increase in crude oil amounts to a tax on U.S. companies and consumers of $ 6 billion over the course of a year , says Du Pont economist Richard Stuckey . At Dow Chemical , every $ 1 increase in oil prices means an extra $ 100 million in higher costs for raw materials . ( Dow says it can recover 70% of those costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thank God for computers , " says Lauren Ryan , spokeswoman for Dow Brands in Indianapolis . The Dow Chemical subisidiary , maker of household products such as the cleanser Fantastik , uses computers to calculate the impact that hypothetical oil prices will have on costs . <p> Minneapolis ' 3M Co. does the same thing . " Like economists , if you do it often enough , you minimize the chances of being way off base . The big problem we have is that we are not sure where it 's going to settle out , " says Jack Hess , staff vice president/purchasing for the chemical company . " We were caught by surprise by the emotions generated in the futures markets . " <p> Airlines are especially vulnerable to day-to-day price spikes . American Airlines , for instance , can store only two days ' supply of jet fuel at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport , its biggest hub . That means the carrier ca n't stock up on oil to protect itself from higher prices in the future . Nor does it try to hedge against further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't speculate in futures because if you 're wrong you can wipe out the company , " Baker says . " ( In the airline industry ) you ca n't plan more than a day ahead what your costs are going to be ... As the price of crude goes up and down , our fuel prices go up and down just like they do at the gas pump . " <p> So for most companies the recent drop in prices would seem to be very good news . But most corporate managers are n't cheering yet . " If Saddam declared war tomorrow , it would go back up $ 10 a barrel , " says Bill Jones , president of Apac , Ashland Oil 's Atlanta-based asphalt subsidiary . " One or two days ' drop does n't mean it 's all over , " agrees Donald Tieken , general manager at Ethyl Corp . ' s Baton Rouge , La. , chemical operation . <p> Still , Ethyl is hoping to take advantage of the oil-price plunge . For weeks , suppliers - oil refiners and chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now that oil prices have dropped sharply , " we need to see the reverse of that , " Tieken says . " It 's causing us , as buyers , to get on the phone " and demand lower petrochemical prices from suppliers . <p> Indeed , whether to pass on higher costs is one of the toughest questions facing corporate planners . The economy is teetering on the brink of recession , so many financially ailing customers may just say no to price increases . The higher costs " are like a hot potato , " Tieken says . " Who 's going to be holding it last ? " <p> Most companies are just hunkering down , crossing their fingers and hoping the Middle East crisis is almost over . Even if it is , the aftereffects may linger in the oil market . " We 're assuming this thing 's going to be settled , " says Jim Anderson , director of purchasing at Monsanto Chemical Co. , maker of speciality chemicals , fibers and plastics and a division of Monsanto Co . Still , Monsanto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel in late 1990 and early 1991 , vs. a pre-invasion forecast of $ 21 to $ 22 . " I would n't say ( forecasting oil prices ) is quite like throwing a dart at the wall , but the oil market 's anything but stable , " Anderson says . <p> " One shot across the bow over there and we 're back at $ 39 , " American 's Baker says . " This market is very volatile , very goosey , it 's very emotional and nervous . " <p> " You try to make an educated guess , " says Apac 's Jones . " You try to outguess the market . You try to outguess the competition . " <p> Apac competes for roadwork contracts from state governments . In some states , higher asphalt and diesel-fuel costs are indexed , insulating the company from unexpected price swings . But some states do n't do that , and Apac has to estimate those costs when it submits its bid . " How desperate you are for a job sometimes determines how much contingency you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has responded quickly to volatile oil prices . Twenty- seven percent of independent petroleum producers polled recently said they have boosted production since Iraq invaded Kuwait . Another 45% said they are reviewing new areas for oil exploration , and 26% said they have increased capital spending since the crisis began . <p> For most firms , though , oil-price volatility is a management nightmare . Says Kumar Chittipeddi , associate professor of management at Bryant College in Smithfield , R.I. : " One of the criticisms of American business is that it does n't plan for the long-term . Well , right now planning for the long-term is a luxury . Planning for survival is what 's important to them right now .
