No matter how ugly things get for Bill Clinton , it seems , he can always count on Al Gore . " I am proud of him , " Gore said from Hawaii on Monday , even as other Democratic politicians were diving for cover or parading their carefully worded disappointment in the President . Gore is feeling good about Clinton " not only because he is a friend but because he is a person who has had the courage to acknowledge mistakes . I am honored to work with this great President . " <P> Scout 's honor . The Vice President is nothing if not loyal ( not to mention helpful , friendly , courteous , kind and obedient ) , but loyalty gets you only so far . At some point every Vice President with an eye on the top job must find a way to excise his boss without looking like a Brutus . For Gore , the trick will be to put some breathing room between himself and Clinton 's character issues and to do it soon  --  but not so soon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Gore can resurface , " says Hank Sheinkopf , a New York City-based political consultant who worked on the Clinton-Gore media campaign in 1996 . " He 's done a brilliant job of staying out of view during the scandal , but at some point he 's got to find the right time to jump up and remind people that he 's not Clinton . " <P> Not Clinton : it 's a tough role for a man who has been running a three-legged race with the President for most of this decade . But it may be the key to Gore 's success in 2000 , because Americans are likely to want a very different kind of President next time around  --  not simply one who has control over his personal life ( Gore 's got no apparent troubles there ) but one who levels with the people in all matters , who says it straight and does n't dissemble . " The reaction now will be to look for just the opposite of Clinton , " says G.O.P. media consultant Alex Castellanos , " someone who can look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big things and serious things . " Even Democrats like Sheinkopf agree . " This scandal will redefine our politics , " he says , " and take it back to basics . The candidate who succeeds will be plainspoken , honorable , not a lot of fluff . People want a President with fewer complications . "
