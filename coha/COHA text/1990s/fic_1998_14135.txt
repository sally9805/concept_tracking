Music . Lights up . Aaron Greidinger enters The Jewish Daily Forward , an isolated pool of light . He reads to himself from a sheaf of letters . AARON " April 12 , 1952 . The Jewish Daily Forward . New York City . Dear Mr. Advisor , There is no one I can turn to who I can trust , only you . I think my wife of thirty-six years is going to leave me . I do not know English . I come from a village near Warsaw . I will be alone in this new country . My children were all killed in Stutthof . What should I do ? " ( He picks up another letter . ) " Worthy Editor , Can you help me ? My son no longer wants to be a Jew  --  as if this was possible He does not keep a kosher home , he has met a gentile girl " ( He picks up another letter . ) " Most Esteemed Advisor , I think I am dead . ( He stops for a moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . " Ah , well . Of course , my friend . So do I. I , too , feel nothing . But what should you and I feel , huh ? Our world no longer exists ( Picks up another letter . To the audience . ) What do I say to  --  the Communist who has become disillusioned with Stalin but seeks a new interpretation of Marxism ; ( Another letter. ) the woman who has tried three times , since she survived the concentration camps , has tried three times to take her own life ; ( Another letter. ) the young man who thinks that what has driven him to madness are " rays beamed at him by aliens " ? Why have these people made up their minds that I alone can rescue them ? ( He goes back to his work . Max Aberdam appears . Max , seventy , looks like he is still from the Jewish quarter in Warsaw  --  flowing tie , hat with a wide brim , he holds a cigar between his fingers , a gold watch chain hangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) p. 3 MAX Aaron Greidinger ! Is it you ? ( Aaron looks up , tries to hide his surprise . ) You look like you 've seen a ghost . Do n't be frightened , I have n't come from the Great Beyond to strangle you ! AARON ( Shaken . ) Max ? Max Aberdam ? Can it be you ? MAX Who else ? AARON I thought you were killed in the camps years ago . MAX The Messiah has come and I arose from the dead . Hey Do n't you read the news in your own newspaper ? Or maybe you 're the one who 's dead ? If that 's the case , go back to your grave . AARON I 'm alive I 'm alive ! MAX So have lunch with me , or I 'll tear you apart like a herring . AARON ( Picking up the letters , shaken , covering . ) I 'm sorry , I can hardly believe it But we have to make it another time My editors are waiting upstairs for these proofs . MAX So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Jewish Forward will not fold up because you are out for half a day . Besides , you should quit the Jewish press . This is America ! This is 1952 ! Why not write in English ? p. 4 AARON English ? Who can express the lives of our people in English ? If I am the last writer to write in Yiddish , I will write in Yiddish ' til the day I die . MAX ( Calming him down . ) All right , all right already . But what is this ? ( Looks at pages . ) A story , I hope ? A novel maybe ? We are waiting for your next masterpiece , you know ! ( He laughs . ) Or is this some more of your rotten advice ? AARON Acch Some advice . MAX So , nu , so what 's the rush then ? ( Throwing the pages . ) This is beneath you . Why ca n't it wait ' til after lunch ? AARON ( A big sigh , giving in . ) All right , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Lights change . Max pulls Aaron to a table at Rappaport 's restaurant . A surly waiter approaches them . ) MAX Coffee . AARON So , nu ? So  --  Where have you been all during the war ? MAX Where have I been ? Where have I not been ! Bialystok , Vilna , Kovno , Shanghai , later in San Francisco . I have experienced the full range of Jewish woes . ( Aaron : " Yes " ) I left my wife and children behind in Warsaw in September of ' 39  --  I thought I would send for them later  --  and like a lot of other people crossed the Praga Bridge towards Bialystok . Who knew it was already in Bolshevik hands p. 5 AARON So what happened to you ? MAX I was arrested , and was within a hairsbreadth of being stood against a wall and shot in the Lubyanka prison in Moscow when a Party functionary in the KGB  --  if you can believe it a former accountant of mine !  --  recognized me and saved me . AARON Incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shanghai . That the Jews are mad , this I 've always known , but that they would be capable of founding a yeshiva in China where they quibble over the fate of an egg that was laid on a Sabbath as their families are being shoved into ovens in Europe  --  that I never imagined . AARON Nothing surprises me anymore . MAX No And your family ? AARON All dead . And everyone I write about  --  all dead . WAITER Coffee . AARON And your family ? MAX ( Pause . ) My wife and two daughters died in Stutthof . Aaron , do n't dawdle , eat , eat ! ( Takes a sip of coffee , nearly spits it out . ) Oy . ( To Aaron . ) In all America you can not get a decent cup of coffee . ( Screams . ) Waiter ! I ordered coffee , not dishwater . ( The waiter stomps over and takes away the coffee cup , muttering . ) So you never married or what ? p. 6 AARON No , I never married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . I know all about you , Aaron Greidinger . All the women at the Writer 's Club in Warsaw talked about you . AARON What did they say ? MAX Hah . What did they say ? What did they not say ? ( Laughs . ) You were a rascal ! You could never stay away from the women at home . Nor they you Am I right ? Everyone I used to meet and fall in love with talked about you . I would lie in bed with a beautiful woman and she would start to cry  --  " Aaron Greidinger has left me ! " AARON Oh , stop , Max . It is n't true . It is n't true ! ( Bitter , haunted . ) Anyway , all those women you and I loved  --  where are they now ? I 'm telling you , Max Some days it 's hard to put one foot in front of the other . MAX ( With deep empathy . ) Of course it is So . Tell me it 's been good for you here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lucky , my brother and I. And we were dumb . Who knew ? We came in the thirties ; we missed the war . MAX Very lucky . Not so dumb . p. 7 AARON So . Now my entire family is dead . Either they died in Europe , or they died here . My brother died just last year . ( Max mutters " I 'm sorry . " )  --  A heart attack . I 've written nothing of consequence since . MAX But that 's nonsense ! I know we Jews ' may not make our authors exactly rich  --  ( Aaron laughs . ) You look like a pauper  --  AARON I am a pauper MAX But you are the finest writer we have . Everyone agrees . AARON ( Agonized . ) No , no . Lately all I write is my advice column . Every day it 's the same . I walk from my office at the newspaper to the Broadway Cafeteria , eat one meal a day , then travel home to my unheated room . I 'm like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of coffee , slams it down . ) WAITER ( To Max . ) Coffee ! Here ! MAX All right . WAITER Enjoy it ! MAX All right ! ( The waiter leaves . ) But how can that be ? So many of us are here !  --  from Lodz , from Warsaw ! You have to see people , Aaron , meet people ! I  --  for example  --  just found a distant relative , filthy rich , actually a millionaire , who fell upon me as if I were his long lost brother . He arranged a big loan for me , and now , I 'm a stock market speculator. p. 8 AARON Do you know anything about the stock market ? MAX No , but who cares ? I make money anyway ! Look , lots of refugees here received a little reparation from Germany and have no idea what to do with it , especially the women . I 've become their manager . I 'm afraid that sooner or later I 'll disappoint my crazy clients , but disappointing women has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) AARON Yes , I also disappoint women , I 'm sorry to say . MAX Oh , thank God ! I was afraid you might have become a prude , a preacher , or some other kind of American misfit . Seriously , though , Arale  --  I ca n't help myself . These women lost their husbands , their children They were driven half-mad in the ghettos and concentration camps . A human being has to love someone or he goes out like a candle . Do n't you agree ? ( Aaron nods , breaks away . ) And why deny it ? I love them also . I am the kind of man who falls in love with every woman between twelve and eighty-nine . AARON ( Laughing . ) You stop at eighty-nine ? MAX Not always . ( Aaron laughs . Max takes a sip of coffee . ) Uocch , this coffee is cold ( He takes out a pill box , extracts two pills and takes them with the remaining coffee . He flinches with pain. ) p. 9 AARON Max , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . Everything the philosopher Oswald Spengler predicted after the First World War has come to pass after the Second . Whether it is social , or spiritual , or a result of God 's madness , I do n't know . I know only what my eyes see . AARON And what do your eyes see ? MAX The world has turned meshugah . Come . There is someone I want you to meet . She 's beautiful , intelligent , an absolute angel What she has lived through she will tell you herself . But first , I 'm afraid I have to introduce you to Priva , my present wife . She is always ill , and she is psychotic besides . She is my misfortune , but she is a faithful reader of yours . She told me more than once that if it were not for you and your scribblings , she would long ago have committed suicide and I would have become a widower , praise God . So you must go with me . AARON No , I could n't possibly , Max . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! You 're not going back there today even if you stand on your head . I am here to bring you back to life ! ( Music . Lights change . Out of the darkness , a woman with gray hair and a youthful face walks toward them . She wears a flowered robe and slippers with pompons . Diamonds sparkle in the lobes of her ears . Her narrow face , long neck , slender figure all radiate wealth and a kind of old Jewish nobility . When she sees Aaron , she makes a motion to retreat . ) Priva ! ( Priva stops . ) Priva ! Look who I 've brought for you ! Here is your great hero ! p. 10 PRIVA Oh , yes , I see ! MAX This is Priva , my wife . ( Priva comes closer and stretches out a narrow hand . ) PRIVA It is an honor and a pleasure . AARON It is my pleasure . PRIVA I read what you write , every word , every week in the newspaper , under all your pseudonyms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for months . AARON Oh , well . It 's coming , it 's coming PRIVA Good . ( She flirts . ) You must promise me to stay for dinner . AARON Really , I can not . PRIVA Why not ? We 'll cook the old Warsaw dishes for you . Borscht , potato kugel , kasha varnischkes  --  AARON Unfortunately , I already have an engagement . PRIVA Well , I wo n't insist , even though I know you are lying to me . AARON No , no I am not . PRIVA But you must promise to come to us soon . AARON Yes , of course . PRIVA Tzlova , our maid , reads all your articles . When she wants to , she can prepare a meal fit for an emperor , and the Talmud says that the true emperors are those who are the learned  --  ( She looks at Max disparagingly. ) writers , men of the spirit . Excuse me . You must meet Tzlova ! ( Priva hurries out . Max takes more pills. ) p. 11 MAX So you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an institution . AARON How so ? She is a fine woman ! ( Max tries to cover his pain . ) Max , are you ill ? MAX It 's nothing , nothing ! ( Referring to Priva . ) She 's too fine . And not healthy . You can divorce a wife , but with an institution , you 're stuck . She comes from a wealthy family of rabbis and merchants . As a child she knew the great writers Isaac Peretz , Herschl Nomberg , Hillel Zeitlin . They came to her home . AARON Ah . Fantastic . MAX No . She is a great grande dame . A snob . In San Francisco , when I met her , my mood was such that all I wanted was some rest . But all of a sudden , wild forces awoke in me . I walked into a trap from which there is no escape . ( Priva returns . ) PRIVA Tzlova wo n't come out ! I begged her and begged her . She absolutely worships you , Mr. Greidinger . She listens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything you write . And she is a darling . If it were not for her , I would have been among the dead long ago . AARON And why wo n't she come out ? PRIVA She 's cooking you dinner . p. 12 AARON Ah ! I see Bu  --  PRIVA You wrote recently that you long to have some Warsaw browned-flour soup . She 'll make it for you better than you had it in Warsaw . At our house we had browned flour soup on Mondays and Thursdays . AARON As did we , as did we . PRIVA Tzlova is the best cook in existence . Whatever she cooks tastes as if it were made in Paradise . All you need is browned flour and fried onions . But  --  she adds a carrot , parsley and dill . AARON Well  --  PRIVA Mr. Greidinger , I stand by the window for hours and look out as they used to do in Poland in the old neighborhoods . I am looking for my friends . Where are they ? In the Old Country , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would pass by . But here in New York , to spot someone through a window is  --  how shall I say it  --  an anachronism . AARON Yes A whole world vanished forever . MAX Come , we have to go ! PRIVA ( To Aaron . ) You 're not staying for dinner ? ( To Max . ) When will you be back ? ( All three start speaking at once . To Aaron . ) When will we see you again ? p. 13 MAX I do n't know . I have a hundred things to do . People are waiting for my checks . I mean , their checks . PRIVA ( Before Aaron can answer , to Max . ) Do n't come back in the middle of the night . ( Max mutters , Priva turns to Aaron . ) AARON Soon , I 'm sure PRIVA ( To Aaron . ) He wakes me up , and then I ca n't shut my eyes for the rest of the night . ( To Max . ) You fall asleep immediately but I lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he puts me through ! ( She extends her hand to Aaron . ) Another time perhaps ? AARON Of course . A pleasure . ( As Aaron kisses her hand , lights change . Street noise . ) MAX ( Unsuccessfully hails a cab . ) TAXI ! Aaron , I am in desperate straits about Miriam . AARON Miriam ? Who is Miriam ? MAX TAXI ! Oh , to me , Miriam is still a child  --  a student ! Young , pretty , intelligent I told you about her . But unfortunately , she married an American poet born in New York who is also young and a lunatic and now she is hoping to get a divorce . p. 14 AARON Oh , I see . MAX ( As he pays . ) But I ca n't divorce Priva ( Aaron : " No " ) And what Miriam sees in me , I 'll never know . She needs a young husband like you . ( Max and Aaron continue on . ) I could easily be her father , or her grandfather AARON Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a DONKEY ! Since you 've become a dispenser of advice , maybe you can tell me how to manage this affair . AARON I ca n't even manage my own affairs . ( Music . Miriam stands before us . The men turn . ) MAX Mein hartz mein neshuma ( She has the face of a girl who seems no older than sixteen . Her dress is the dress of a Warsaw school-girl 's , lacking the slightest pretense to elegance . no make-up , blazing eyes , she walks toward them , wraps herself around Max . He presents her with a small heart-shaped box of chocolates . ) MIRIAM ( To Max . ) Chocolates again ? Oh , I shall have to kill you ! MAX Go ahead ! Kill ! This is New York . There 'll be only one corpse more . p. 15 MIRIAM ( Turns to Aaron . ) My name is Miriam . AARON ( Flushed , amazed by her . ) Aaron . Aaron Greidinger . MIRIAM ( Good-naturedly scolding Max . ) You did n't even introduce me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are . AARON You do ? MIRIAM I am Miriam , that 's enough . ( She snatches the chocolates from Max , and they enter her apartment . The room is a bedroom with a large bed , unmade . She throws herself on it . ) I want you to know that I am your greatest fan in the whole world . I read every word you write . MAX Stop ! He 'll get a swelled head ! MIRIAM I have written my dissertation about you . AARON No ! That 's impossible . MIRIAM You write the way people speak . AARON ( Smiling , pleased , almost embarrassed . ) Is n't that what a writer should do ? MIRIAM Yes . But none of the others seem to do it . AARON Perhaps it 's because I do n't write fiction . ( Miriam howls. ) p. 16 MIRIAM How do you mean you do n't write fiction ! AARON I make nothing up . I meet people , they tell me their lives , what happened to them , especially during the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MIRIAM ( Suddenly old . ) It is n't simple . A whole world collapsed before my very eyes . But you , my favorite author , you bring it back to life . AARON No . No writer can possibly resurrect what the wicked have destroyed . MIRIAM ( Revealed . ) Yes I know ( They stare at each other . ) MAX Love at first sight , huh ? Hey !  --  when I bring a guest to meet my girl , I want her to receive him properly . Put on some shoes , serve some food . I 'll help you clean up . This is an apartment , not a pigsty , you wild creature . ( He playfully slaps her behind . She laughs . ) MIRIAM And what are you ? You did n't even give me a kiss . ( As he takes her in his arms : ) MAX You do n't deserve a kiss . ( She gives Aaron a flirtatious look as she and Max kiss . Aaron turns away. ) p. 17 MIRIAM Sit , Mr. Greidinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the coffee . As Max straightens the bed proprietarily , Aaron straightens his tie , his hair . From off : ) Mr. Greidinger  --  AARON ( Calling To her . ) Please , Aaron ! MIRIAM " Aaron "  --  the other day I read a piece of yours about a religion of protest . What did you mean by it ? Do n't laugh , but " someone " ( Looking at Max as she enters with coffee. ) had torn out a part of the page , and I was unable to finish it . ( They laugh . ) MAX He probably forgot what he meant . He has a dozen pseudonyms , and he has to deliver copy constantly . He writes whatever comes into his head . MIRIAM ( Sitting with Max . ) Oh , hush , Maxele . Let him answer . AARON No , I certainly did not forget . What I meant was that one may believe in God 's wisdom and yet deny that He is the source of goodness only . God and mercy are not absolutely synonymous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AARON We will no longer be flatterers and masochists . We will no longer kiss the rod that whips us. p. 18 MAX I do n't know about you , but I am quite willing to do without God and the whole religious paraphernalia that goes with him . AARON On what would you base ethics ? MAX There is no base and no ethics . AARON In other words , might is right ? MAX So it seems . MIRIAM Oh , Max AARON If might is right , Hitler was right . MAX Inasmuch as he was defeated , he was not right . If he had won , all the nations of the world would have joined hands with him . The entire world . MIRIAM Really . Max , you are wrong . We Jews must never entertain the notion that there is no morality in the universe and that man may do whatever he likes . MAX And what does Jewishness consist of ? When we Jews had might , four thousand years ago , we fell upon the Canaanites , the Girgashim , the Prizim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , and child . What , Aaron Greidinger , is your definition of God ? AARON The plan behind evolution , the Power which moves the galaxies MAX That power is blind and knows no plan . There is nothing but chaos . p. 19 MIRIAM Yet , you 're always speaking of God , Max . You even fast on Yom Kippur . MAX Not from piety . I do it in remembrance of my parents . One can be a Jew without believing in God . MIRIAM Well , yes , that is certainly true for me . ( Aaron looks at her . She looks back . Max , seeing this : ) MAX Excuse me , my children . I have to telephone someone by nine o'clock . Business calls . ( Max goes off into the other room . He can be heard off , picking up the phone and doing business . Aaron puts down his coffee cup . ) MIRIAM I still can scarcely believe that you are here in my apartment . Being together with you and Max makes me feel as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only a nightmare . AARON What happened to you ? Do you mind my asking ? MAX ( Off . ) Stocks ? Which stocks ? I told you to sell those stocks ! MIRIAM If I were granted one wish before I die I would ask that you and Max move in with me , so that we three could be together . AARON You are too young to be speaking of death . MIRIAM Too young ? I have stared death in the face for years . p. 20 AARON Ah I see MIRIAM Aaron ? ( Miriam runs up to Aaron and kisses him passionately . ) MAX ( Off . ) Texaco ? How much ? Wait , Hershele , I will write it down . Hershele , wait  --  AARON ( Trying to cover , smooth over what has just happened ; shaken and aroused . ) Who , uh who is Hershele ? MIRIAM ( Laughing . ) His name is Harry Treibitcher , not Hershele ; he 's American-born . Max insists on calling him Hershele . He is a speculator , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given him " power of attorney "  --  and that is sheer madness !  --  By the way , how do you say " power of attorney " in Yiddish ? AARON In Yiddish , there is no such word . In my father 's court , " power of permission " was used . He was a rabbi . MIRIAM Yes , I know . There were rabbis in my family , too . Also Hasidim . ( They stare at each other . ) During the war , when I was in hiding , I read Dostoevsky in French and found him absolutely entrancing . You are like a character from Dostoevsky . You always keep yourself hidden . In my unfinished dissertation I call you " the Hider . " You know , I 've given my life a goal  --  to make you famous . ( He laughs . ) Do n't laugh . Someone has to do it . p. 21 AARON But I am dissatisfied with my creative work . Perhaps your life 's goal is empty . MIRIAM I do n't think so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , I have another ambition  --  actually two . AARON ( Flustered , amazed . ) What are they ? MIRIAM To tell you all that I have lived through  --  everything , leaving out nothing , not even the most foolish things . ( Aaron looks at her , heart in mouth . ) AARON What is the second ambition ? MIRIAM That one I 'd better not mention today . ( She laughs . They stare at each other . Max enters , practically dancing . ) MAX The market is going up ! We are reaping shovelfuls of gold in the land of Columbus . And what are you two doing ? She probably told you every possible evil about me . Do n't believe a word of it . She takes after you , a born storyteller . Listen children , I 've just learned that I must travel to Poland . MIRIAM To Poland ? ! MAX My father left me a house in Lodz , and the Poles are finally letting me sell it  --  for one-tenth of its value , naturally . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MAX Soon . If the whole affair is a trap and the Communists are bent on liquidating me , you two will know what to do . MIRIAM ( Angry , through tears . ) How can you go back to Poland ? Poland is a graveyard . ( She looks to Aaron for understanding . ) Aaron , tell him ! ( To Max . ) You must be drunk . MAX I was born drunk . Pif-paf ! A world full of wonders . ( Wipes away her tears . ) Listen , my darling , what became of our supper , huh ? ( Miriam looks at Aaron , frightened . Max puts his arm around her and moves her away . Music . Lights change . Aaron alone . A surreal light . Sounds . ) AARON That night , I dreamt I 'm back in Poland with my family and all the other lost souls . I 'm scrambling over mass graves Jews dug for themselves . The mounds of earth are moving and muffled cries rise from below , cries for help ; those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corpses smothering them . I 'm one of those struggling for life . ( The phone rings , lights change . Aaron picks up the phone . ) Yes ? MIRIAM ( Off . ) May I speak with Mr. Greidinger ? p. 23 AARON Speaking . ( A Pause . ) MIRIAM ( Off . ) I hope I did n't wake you . This is Miriam , remember me ? AARON ( Formal , covering his delight . ) You did n't wake me . Yes , Miriam . It 's very good to hear from you . MIRIAM ( Off . ) Ah ( Pause . Laughs . ) I told you last evening of the dissertation I am writing about you . It occurred to me that you might meet with me before I went to work . Perhaps Max told you I 'm a baby-sitter . AARON No , he did not . MIRIAM ( Off . ) Yes . For a little boy named Didi . He 's a darling . They live on Park Avenue . By the way , how do you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such idea . MIRIAM I have a great many questions to ask you . I know it is presumptuous , and if you have no time or patience for me today , I wo n't feel insulted . AARON I have both time and patience . MIRIAM ( Off . ) Have you had breakfast ? p. 24 AARON No , I was on my way to the Broadway Cafeteria . MIRIAM ( Off . ) May I join you ? AARON Yes , yes . Of course . MIRIAM ( Off . ) Good . By the time you reach the cafeteria I 'll be there . AARON Where is Max ? MIRIAM ( Off . ) Max and I spoke about you for a long time last night . That I love you is not altogether astonishing ( Aaron is stunned. ) , but Max said last night that you are like a son to him . Ah , I have so much to tell you , and I do n't even know where to begin . Bye ! ( She hangs up . Aaron , amazed , hangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Miriam enters , resplendent in white . Aaron 's heart pounds . He walks toward her . Miriam takes Aaron 's arm , and they enter the cafeteria . Aaron sees an empty table by a window and grabs it . AARON Sit , sit . I 'll get us food . MIRIAM I 'm not really hungry . I want nothing more than coffee . ( Aaron nods . They are both breathless , looking at each other . He goes to get food . She watches him . The cafeteria is full of refugees . One hears only Yiddish and some Polish . Aaron gets breakfast for both of them and returns. ) p. 25 AARON Whatever is here is for you . MIRIAM But I 've eaten . ( She tastes the fruit and grabs a roll . She laughs . ) Mmmmm . Good . ( They both eat . Miriam is hunched over her food , eats voraciously . Aaron sees what she has been through . ) AARON We sit here . We 're two refugees . But it is you who 's Hitler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perils until you found a haven in this blessed land , where a Jewish girl can study at a university , rent an apartment , even write a dissertation on an unknown Yiddish writer . ( She presses her knee against his leg under the table . ) MIRIAM You know I am not a moralist . AARON Good . MIRIAM I have had men in Poland as well as here , and I always had the illusion that I loved each man , or at least that he loved me . At the same time that I study , read , become inspired by you and others  --  dream of happiness , of having a child  --  I become tired of this cursed game and want to put an end to it . AARON No , no . Do n't say it . MIRIAM Have you noticed how many refugees from the camps wait to kill themselves here in America ? p. 26 AARON Yes , there is such a thing as feeling you did not deserve to live . MIRIAM Yes . In Max , this feeling is even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to provide for everyone , all the refugees , but especially for me . You know his wife and two children died  --  ( Hard to say. ) in Stutthoff . AARON Yes . MIRIAM ( Taking his hand . ) And you ? Do you ever feel you did not deserve to live ? AARON All the time . MIRIAM Good . AARON Good ? MIRIAM Yes , good . I understand you . ( Releasing his hand , turning away . ) Max probably told you that I have a husband . AARON Yes . MIRIAM Stanley Bardeles . He 's a maniac , a compulsive scribbler without talent . He refuses to grant me a divorce and creates all sorts of difficulties . Max has convinced himself that I am a helpless little girl , a child , but in fact I often have the feeling that I am old , very old . AARON How many men have you had ? ( Aaron looks down , immediately regretting his lack of tact. ) p. 27 MIRIAM ( Smiling . ) Why do you ask ? AARON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MIRIAM I had many . AARON Twenty ? MIRIAM At least . AARON Why did you do it ? MIRIAM When you are lying in a hole for many months , a hole so small you can barely stretch your legs  --  and your life is threatened  --  every encounter with someone from the world of the living is an exciting event . AARON What is this hole you were lying in for many months ? MIRIAM When our apartment was seized , my mother was sent to a concentration camp and I was smuggled out of the ghetto to the Aryan side . I was fifteen . A former teacher of mine hid me in a dark alcove where old furniture was stored . I was forced to pay the concierge 's son bribe money to let me stay . He also forced me to submit to him , and when he came to me he held a knife to my throat . AARON I 'm sorry . MIRIAM When I finally came out to freedom and saw a city of ruins , I felt as if through some miracle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story like this  --  p. 28 AARON " In the World of Chaos . " Its hero is a corpse who does n't know that he is dead . MIRIAM Yes it was my life Sometimes , hiding in barns , or fields , I would sleep near a man who , without a word , would climb on me . There was no sense creating a scandal . Agents from Palestine , members of the Brikha came to help us . These " rescuers " were also men , not angels AARON I see MIRIAM I am sure that you find me repulsive , now that I 've told you these things . But since you asked , I wanted to answer . AARON I had no right to ask . And it is the murderers I find repulsive , not the victims . MIRIAM What does a woman have in such circumstances ? Nothing but her body . ( Aaron : " Ah " ) When we reached Germany we were placed in a camp again  --  AARON Again ? What do you mean , another camp ? MIRIAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of camp , I mean , a refugee camp , not a concentration camp  --  to await our visas for America or Palestine . So we were still inmates of a camp . ( Miriam is overwhelmed . She looks at her watch . ) Oh , my God , it 's a quarter to eleven . I must get to my babysitting job on Park Avenue ! p. 29 AARON May I walk you ? MIRIAM Of course . Every minute with you is pure joy for me . AARON Why do you say that ? MIRIAM The other day Max asked me whom I would like as my future husband or lover  --  and I answered immediately , Aaron Greidinger . Max wants to provide me with a husband . I hope you do n't mind , but Max is older than you are . He must be my number one until he dies . Do you mind being number two ? AARON ( Barely able to talk . ) I would be delighted . MIRIAM Are you serious ? AARON Completely . ( Lights change . Music . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Max enters , popping pills . ) MAX Aaron Greidinger ! AARON ( Looks up . ) Max ? What are you doing here ? MAX Call Miriam immediately . You two are coming to a party with me tonight . AARON What ? I  --  I could n't possibly . MAX What are you talking about ? AARON I do n't like parties . I do n't like crowds of people . p. 30 MAX Do n't give me that nonsense . You 're coming . It 's not a crowd . You are invited to Chaim Joel Treibitcher 's house , for dinner . AARON Who ? MAX Chaim Joel is a philanthropist for Jewish arts . He 's rich , he 'll back you . You 'll come . With Miriam . AARON Max no , really MAX Call Miriam . ( He squeezes Aaron 's cheeks . ) She has the address , dahlink . See you tonight ! CALL MIRIAM NOW ! ( He exits . Aaron sighs , thinks , calls Miriam . Lights change . ) MIRIAM Hello . AARON Miriam ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized your voice immediately . ( Pause . ) AARON Ah MIRIAM I just finished work AARON Yes ( Long pause . ) Your babysitting MIRIAM Yes AARON You know , Max just came by inviting us to a party . MIRIAM Yes . I know . Max insists I take you or you will remain impoverished , a shnorrer forever . ( They laugh . ) You know this Chaim Joel ? ( Aaron : " No " ) He is an absolute angel and his nephew Harry is a complete and total scoundrel . I told you about Harry , remember p. 31 AARON Yes MIRIAM The first night we met . AARON Yes MIRIAM You know Max asked me to go with him to Poland , but the thought of being there again , of walking amongst the dead , makes me shudder . ( Lights reveal Miriam is half-clothed on her bed . ) AARON I understand . MIRIAM What are you doing right now ? ( Aaron looks at his work . ) AARON Ah , nothing at all . MIRIAM Come over . AARON What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --  I  --  MIRIAM I need you . I need you now . AARON ( Long pause . ) I need you , too . ( Music . Miriam slowly slips off her dressing gown . She is in a flimsy slip . In the light she looks almost naked . Aaron turns They see each other , move together . They embrace without a word . Lights change as they start to make love , passionately . Blackout . Lights come up . Aaron and Miriam are still in bed but it is now twilight , not afternoon . They are asleep . Miriam stirs . Half-asleep she whispers : ) p. 32 MIRIAM Max ? ( Aaron stirs . ) AARON No , it 's me . MIRIAM ( Murmuring . ) Come . Butterfly . I think I shall call you Butterfly . AARON I want nothing but to be with you . ( They embrace . ) Until now , I never believed I could love a woman knowing that she loved another . ( Miriam laughs . ) MIRIAM Is that true ? AARON Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have loved women who had husbands . MIRIAM Of course . AARON And I took great pains to tell these women that their husbands should be number one . MIRIAM I should hope so . AARON It is pleasant to know that I need not demand of my beloved what I am not prepared to ask of myself . MIRIAM I want to know everything about you  --  about who you 've loved , about all your women  --  who has loved you back AARON Ahhhh MIRIAM The last one , the last love  --  did she break your heart ? ( A pause. ) p. 33 AARON No , the truth is , sadly , I have never loved a woman I could n't leave . ( She pulls him to her . They kiss . ) MIRIAM I know you , I have studied every word you have written . I have loved you for so long Would you like to know everything about me ? AARON I would like nothing more No one can ever kiss me or attract me or satisfy me as you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many other lifetimes . We were fish in the sea together , ( Miriam : " Yes . " ) we were birds in the air . We two were in the garden of Eden ; I was Adam and you were Eve , and when you had me taste the forbidden fruit , we were cast out of Paradise together . Together we were slaves in the land of Egypt . We were forty days and forty nights in the desert , and when the moment of liberation came , we entered the land of milk and honey , and I could never get enough of your milk , your honey ( She laughs . ) MIRIAM God toys with us , Aaron Greidinger ( They start to make love . Soon we hear a fumbling at the front door ; Miriam jerks away with a scream . Aaron bolts up . Suddenly the hall ceiling light is on . Silhouetted , is a young man , short and stocky with long hair and a black beard , dressed in a pink shirt , dirty trousers , holding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to strike , but stops . ) Stanley ! p. 34 STANLEY Yes , it 's me . MIRIAM What do you want ? STANLEY You . MIRIAM You see that I have someone . STANLEY ( Pointing the revolver at Aaron . ) Hey , you . If you want to live a few years longer , better get out of here . Otherwise they 'll carry you out . AARON May I get dressed ? STANLEY Yeah . Take your rags and go into the bathroom . Make no attempt to get help or I 'll  --  AARON Just a moment . ( Aaron draws a cover around him . his feet touch the floor and almost buckle . ) STANLEY Wait a minute . I know you , I know you . You 're the writer , Aaron Greidinger . I 'm a writer , too . AARON Yes , yes . Mr. Stanley , I am acquainted with your situation  --  I know you are her husband  --  and I can understand your feeling , but there is no need to point a gun at us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't make a fool of yourself . Put down the revolver . STANLEY I 've come to put an end either to your stinking life or to mine . I wo n't kill this man , but you , you filthy whore , soon you 'll be dead and gone . Mr. Greidinger , I think you should know that you have been consorting with a whore . She was a whore at fifteen ; she told me so herself . In 1939 , when her parents left for Russia , she refused to join them because she was the mistress of a pimp . Later he brought her over to the Aryan side and put her in a brothel . Is this true or not ? p. 35 MIRIAM It 's not true . STANLEY You told me so yourself with your own filthy mouth . Nazis were your clients . They brought you gifts they seized from murdered Jewish girls . Am I lying ? Answer me , or this will be your last moment . MIRIAM I did n't want to die at sixteen . STANLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of taking up with a pimp . Am I telling the truth ? MIRIAM At sixteen , I wanted to live . Now I no longer do . You can shoot me this instant , you psychopath ! AARON Miriam , this can not be true . ( She does not answer . ) STANLEY ( To Aaron . ) Go use the bathroom , and make it quick . ( Aaron gropes for the door , feeling weak . ) AARON ( Weakly , feeling foolish . ) Excuse me . ( He goes into the bathroom , he starts to dress , feels faint , nearly swoons , gets sick in the sink . Stanley advances on Miriam , tries to kiss her . She fights him off . Stanley screams at Aaron through the door . ) STANLEY It 's all true ! You 're a writer , a son of a rabbi ! You should know what you are and who you 've taken up with . p. 36 MIRIAM ( In a hiss . ) He already knows everything . STANLEY How could he know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I meet someone who knows you , I learn of more lovers , more affairs , more lies . MIRIAM I told you the truth right from the beginning . ( Aaron emerges from the bathroom , white , ill , wearing pants and shirt . ) STANLEY Put on your tie . Before you go , I want to ask you a question . Is it true that you believe in God ? AARON I believe in His wisdom , not in His mercy . STANLEY I would like to speak with you someday about this , but not now . MIRIAM Aaron ( He looks at her . ) STANLEY Go . If you read in the papers that we 're both dead , you 'll know why . AARON Do n't do it . If she is as you say , she is not worth dying for . MIRIAM And what is worth dying for ? ( Aaron looks at her a long time , then walks past them . ) STANLEY ( Calling after him . ) If you call the police , I 'll kill both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Aaron will not look at Miriam . He stumbles out . falls . Stanley drags Miriam off . Aaron sits on a park bench , rocks , holds his head . ) AARON No , no , no Miriam He rocks , recites a prayer for the dead . He holds his head . Surreal light . Music . Passage of time to early morning . Exhausted , spent , he goes to his office at the Jewish Forward . A phone is ringing . He hears it , stares at it . It stops . He throws himself into his chair , frightened , angry . It rings again . It keeps ringing . He tries to defy it but finally , exhausted , he answers . Long pause . ) Yes ? MIRIAM It 's me , the whore . ( Aaron makes a motion to hang up the phone , but he clings to it . ) You left your keys in my apartment , also your checkbook and some money . Like Tamar , the whore , I want to return thy signet , thy bracelet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prostitute , but you are one . MIRIAM Then how is it that a man as saintly as Judah went to her ? AARON Miriam , this is not the time to discuss tales from the Pentateuch . MIRIAM When is the proper time ? I want to give you your things . I may be a whore but I am not a thief . p. 38 AARON Miriam , everything is finished between us . MIRIAM I want to return your property . ( He struggles . ) AARON Meet me at the cafeteria . MIRIAM Good . ( Aaron slowly hangs up the phone . Music starts . He turns , drawn to the sound . Out of the darkness , Miriam appears . She wears a red dress and red boots . From her scarlet lips , a cigarette dangles . Aaron sees her and loses his breath . The street noise is deafening . ) AARON No ( She walks slowly downstage . He approaches her , enraged . In strangled voice . ) You planned it all . The quote from the Pentateuch , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be arrested . ( She laughs . ) You 've made fools of me , Max , Stanley , and the devil knows who else MIRIAM You said you wanted to know everything about me . Well , this is what I was and what I shall always be . I do n't feel guilty , not for a minute . It was foolish at sixteen to fall in love with a scoundrel like Yanek and to endure all I have endured . But what is the sense of feeling remorse ? Repentance is a religious concept . If one does not believe in a personal God or in sexual morality , how can there be any repentance for what I have done ? I wanted to live . I was prepared to die , and the fact that I survived at least physically is something I can not explain . If I have any regrets , it is that I kept the truth from you and Max . But the truth surfaced anyway , as they say  --  like oil on water . p. 39 AARON A person like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MIRIAM Maybe so But it is still a fact that I have lived , suffered , and hoped . You once quoted Spinoza in one of your stories . " There are no lies , only distorted truths . " Even a worm has its own small truth . It is born , it lives briefly , then it is trampled under someone 's foot . Those are your words , not mine . ( She smiles . ) AARON What happened after I left ? MIRIAM You want to know . AARON You are not obliged to answer . ( Pause . ) MIRIAM Things happened . Stanley stayed with me the whole night . I did not expect to live ' til morning , and I was prepared to die . Stanley was not the first to threaten me with a revolver . That same Yanek for whom I had sacrificed my life amused himself by shooting a glass tumbler which he put on my head . He brought his colleagues  --  Poles , not Germans  --  and they played the same game . This is but one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Do n't think that I have come to you to cry or to apologize . I owe you nothing . Not you , not even Max . AARON Where is Max ? MIRIAM Max is on his way to Poland . p. 40 AARON Did you see him before he left ? MIRIAM How could I ? The telephone rang , but Stanley forbade me to pick it up . I found out that this morning , after the party , Max left for Poland together with Matilda Treibitcher , Chaim Joel 's wife . AARON How did you get rid of your husband ? MIRIAM My husband , huh ? ( She laughs . ) Since he did n't kill me , sooner or later he had to be on his way . Before he left , he said that he was ready to divorce me . It was funny , really funny . AARON Why was it funny ? MIRIAM He could n't decide whether to kill me or not . He kept talking about it , and finally he asked my advice . Have you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-called tragedy , I had to laugh . AARON What was your advice ? MIRIAM My advice was : Do what you like . AARON Is this one of your distorted truths ? MIRIAM This is what happened . AARON And then ? MIRIAM He said good-bye and left . One minute he spoke about killing me and the next , he babbled about a reconciliation . He even proposed that we have a child together . I would not have believed it to be possible , except after what I have seen in my life , nothing about the human race can shock me anymore . You may be a writer , but I know more of what human beings are capable of than you . p. 41 AARON What about the teacher and the dark alcove in which you allegedly spent the war years  --  was that also a lie ? MIRIAM It was not a lie . I did n't struggle hard to stay alive  --  what for ? But a sort of ambition grew in me to overcome everything and to come through those swinish times alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gamble or sport for me : Will I make it or will I not ? The day it became clear to me that I would be grabbed and sent away with one of the transports , I fled from Yanek , and my former teacher took me in . AARON When was that ? MIRIAM The end of 1942 . No , it was already 1943 . AARON Did your teacher know of your conduct ? MIRIAM Yes ; no . Who knows ? AARON And it was at her house that you read all those books ? MIRIAM ( Uncomfortable . ) Yes , at her house . AARON And then ? MIRIAM In 1945 , I crawled out , like a mouse from a hole , and another chapter began  --  wandering , sneaking across borders , sleeping in barns , in ditches , and all the rest . AARON What happened to your pimp ? p. 42 MIRIAM Someone gave him his due . ( They sit a long time . Miriam makes a motion to open her bag . ) Look , I have your property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not here in the street . MIRIAM Where did Tamar return Judah 's belongings ? ( Aaron looks at her , cold , stung . Angry . ) None of you has the right to point a finger at me . Not you , not Max , not that idiot Stanley . How am I a whore any more than you are a lecher ? What do you think goes on in middle-class America , or for that matter , in the Jewish State ? What of the women in America whose husbands lavish furs and jewelry and Cadillacs on them while they themselves while away their time with all sorts of trash ? How am I worse than the girls in my college ? Heaven knows how many men my classmates have had . At least I was trying to rescue my stinking life . Most of the Jewish girls who fell into Nazi hands would have done the same if they had been given half the chance . ( They sit a long time without speaking . ) Here is your property . ( Miriam opens her handbag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had in an envelope . ) You can tell Max everything that happened . Just remember that I can manage without men , too . If you like , this can be our last meeting . ( Long pause . ) Look at the sky ! ( Long pause. ) p. 43 AARON Beautiful . MIRIAM Butterfly  --  I can no longer live without you . That 's the bitter truth . AARON Huh the bitter truth ( ? ) So soon ? MIRIAM With me everything happens quickly . Either quickly or not at all . AARON What about Max ? MIRIAM I miss him , too . AARON And Stanley ? MIRIAM ( Shivers . ) Do n't mention his name , may it be cursed . Butterfly , I have an idea . But promise not to laugh at it . AARON I will not laugh . MIRIAM Since you already know the truth about me , let everything remain as it is . AARON Let what remain as it is ? MIRIAM I will be a prostitute and you will be my client . My apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I will be cheap . A dollar a week , or ten cents a night . There were cheap prostitutes in Warsaw , in fact on your street . AARON What about Max ? MIRIAM He will call me that too . I no longer want to play deceptive games . I want to be an honest prostitute . ( Aaron almost wants to laugh , but he also feels a stinging in his eyes. ) p. 44 AARON And what of the others ? MIRIAM What others ? There will be no others . AARON A prostitute with two clients only ? MIRIAM Yes , you and Max . If Max does not want me , I 'll be yours alone . ( A long pause . ) AARON What shall we do now ? MIRIAM Give me ten cents . AARON In advance ? MIRIAM In Warsaw , they always paid in advance . AARON Wait . ( Aaron digs in his trouser pocket until he finds a dime . Miriam stretches out her hand . ) Here . ( He puts the dime in her hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . then she takes it with her other hand and holds the dime to her lips . ) MIRIAM This is the happiest night of my life . ( Tears stream down her face . Slow fade to black . Music . A lullaby . Lights up on Miriam 's apartment , weeks later . Aaron lies on the bed , writing , making notes . Miriam sings the lullaby to the baby , Didi , off . ) AARON What are you singing ? MIRIAM ( Calling . ) An old lullaby . Do you know it ? p. 45 AARON ( Calling to her , off . ) I do n't know ( She sings . He listens , remembers . ) Yes I 'm surprised to say I do . ( He goes back to his writing , then looks up . ) Just remember he is n't yours . You have to give him back ! MIRIAM I know , I know ( She laughs , enters with the baby . Sits on the bed with Aaron . ) I wish we would hear from Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phoned repeatedly  --  all week . No one is at home . MIRIAM ( Suddenly cold . ) Do you think they have arrested Max in Poland ? AARON ( Not sure himself . ) Of course they have n't . Why would they ? MIRIAM Who knows what they are capable of doing to us there . ( She stares at the baby . Miriam suddenly laughs . ) AARON What ? MIRIAM Look , Arale , is n't the baby a darling ? AARON For the time being . MIRIAM What do you mean by that ? AARON He 'll probably grow up to be a thief , a crook , or a murderer . p. 46 MIRIAM How can you say that ? It is more likely he 'll become an honest man , an artist , a scholar . Like you . ( She looks at Aaron . ) Take him . AARON What ? I do n't know how to hold a baby . MIRIAM Take him . Like this . He 's almost asleep . ( She gives him the baby . He holds him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Yiddish lullaby . He is surprised he knows the rest of it . As he sings , he gets more and more engrossed with the baby . Miriam exits , leaving him alone with the baby . ) AARON You know , I 've never wanted a child ; I never wanted to bring a new soul into this accursed world , but tonight  --  I feel such tenderness for you you , who are entirely helpless , you who are entirely dependent on our kindness . ( Miriam comes in , frantic , with a copy of the Jewish Forward . ) MIRIAM Arale , Arale ! Oh , my God , my punishment has come at last . He 's lost everything . Everybody 's money ! AARON What ? ( She reads him the headline . ) MIRIAM " Max Aberdam , who speculated with the money of Polish refugees  --  " ( She stops. ) p. 47 AARON No , no It ca n't be ! MIRIAM Max 's heart will break . Oh , my God , my God I warned Max , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you that Harry was a swindler and a gambler . Oh , Aaron , this was not simply money . This was gut money , blood money , reparation money refugee mothers received for their children ( Miriam breaks down . ) This will be what finally kills him What does God want , Aaron ? He must want something ( She exits with the baby . Aaron looks after her , helpless . The phone rings . ) AARON Yes ? MAX ( V. O. ) I 've returned from my grave to strangle you . ( His heart leaps . ) AARON Where are you ? Where are you calling from ? ( Calling off . ) MIRIAM ! ( No answer . ) MAX I am in New York . I just flew from Europe . Arale , I am here incognito . Even Priva does n't know I 've arrived . If my refugees find out I 'm here , they 'll tear me limb from limb , and they have a right to do so . AARON Why did n't you write to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you cables . To Poland , to Matilda 's house in Switzerland p. 48 MAX All the curses of the Holy Book rained down on my head during this trip . AARON Where are you now ? MAX In the Empire Hotel on Broadway . How is Miriam ? AARON She 's worried sick about you She must have just gone out . MAX Listen , Arale  --  I became seriously ill in Poland . Miriam was right . Poland is a graveyard . Matilda went back to her childhood village . She suffered a heart attack there . She 's dead . AARON What MAX She 's lucky . After many difficulties , Chaim Joel managed to take her body to Eretz Yisrael . She will lie there with other righteous men and women . As for me , it seems that I 'll have to make do with a grave in New York . AARON What do you mean ? What are you planning to do ? MAX I do n't know . I was given the name of an American doctor , a world authority in the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to die among strangers . AARON I 'll come right over . MAX No , no . Come over tomorrow , quietly . No one must know I am here . ( Miriam appears , looks at Aaron and knows he is talking to Max . She becomes hysterical , laughing and crying . She grabs the phone from Aaron. ) p. 49 MIRIAM Maxele ! ? MAX Yes , my treasure , it 's me . MIRIAM Oh , my darling , Max . I was so afraid that you were dead . MAX No , no my dear . Not yet . MIRIAM Oh , my darling , my darling , my darling I 'd rather die than leave you alone , mein hartz , mein neshuma . Where are you ? MAX I 've taken another name for myself  --  Dr. Sigmund Klein . I am at the Empire Hotel on Broadway . The eighth floor . MIRIAM I 'll be right there . ( She hangs up . To Aaron : ) I am going to him now . Bring the baby to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathers her things , Aaron moves to kiss her She runs out , leaving Aaron stunned . ) AARON ( To himself . ) She never made a secret of it  --  Max is her number one until death . ( Lights change . Max 's hotel room . Miriam hovers over a man who is barely recognizable . ) MAX Aaron ! I must recite the " Blessed be He who restores the dead to life " over you . I was so worried when you did not come . ( Aaron approaches , bends down , and kisses him . Max takes Aaron 's shoulders and kisses him. ) p. 50 AARON Max  --  you told me not to c  --  MAX Ssssh . My friend , I am not well . But thank God I am not ready yet to give up the ghost . AARON Max , you 'll be cured here . You 'll be strong as an ox . MIRIAM Butterfly , do n't let him become resigned . He 'll come through this healthy and strong ! MAX Nothing lasts forever . Arale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few dollars I took , and I want to die . ( He grabs Aaron 's arm . ) I hope you told no one where I am . If they find out , they 'll come flying like locusts and bury me alive . I know that Priva is moving heaven and earth to find me . And I am now penniless . I can not pay for a doctor here to treat me . How long can it all go on ? AARON Max , everything will end well , you will see . MAX Maybe it will , maybe it wo n't . AARON I 'll find you money . MAX Suddenly the pauper is a banker . Look , Arale , if you and Miriam are happy , I am happy . The truth is that I knew I would die soon and that is why I brought you two together . I lay there in the hospital in Warsaw , in agony , surrounded by drunks , degenerates , lunatics , and I had but one thought to comfort me ; you two were in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perished , you are my children . p. 51 MIRIAM Maxele , I am your wife , not your daughter . My place is with you . MAX Nonsense , I am approaching the end of my life while you are just beginning yours . My advice to you is this : Divorce that lunatic Stanley and marry Aaron . You are a fitting pair , truthless and luckless . ( He laughs , looking at the two of them . Aaron looks away . ) MIRIAM Max , you 've become a matchmaker now ? MAX Miriam , my darling , would you leave us for a moment ? You have had not one hour of sleep , and I must speak to Aaron . ( Miriam looks at both men , upset . Then she kisses Max . She exits . Max settles in and looks at Aaron . ) Arale The whole idea of monogamy is a big lie . It was invented by women and by puritanical Christians . It never existed among Jews . Even our great teacher Moses craved a Nubian woman , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with scabies . Where is it written that I must be saintlier than Moses or the patriarch Job ? When a man is impotent he is dragged before the rabbi and forced to give his wife a divorce . But when a wife is frigid , cold as ice , she is praised for being chaste . My first wife , may she rest in peace , had that one redeeming virtue  --  so I was utterly miserable . But what of a woman who is born with hot blood ? The whole world rises to condemn her . She is nothing but a whore . You know very well who I am talking about . p. 52 AARON Miriam told you everything ? MAX Everything . AARON You know her past ? MAX Yes . AARON What would you call her then ? MAX I would take her as she is . AARON Would you marry her ? MAX If I were your age , yes . AARON But Max MAX ( He shakes his head . ) There is one thing I want you to promise me  --  do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MAX You do . You do . If you are not going to marry her , you must tell her . She is pinning her hopes on you . What ? ! She 's not like your mother  --  chaste , pure ? Aaron , as improbable as it may sound , when it comes to real love  --  what she feels for you  --  Miriam is a virtuous virgin . ( Music . Lights change . Days later . Miriam 's apartment . Aaron , deep in thought , goes home . ) MIRIAM ( Calling to him . ) Arale , have you heard ? AARON ( As he enters . ) Heard what ? p. 53 MIRIAM It 's a miracle . Chaim Joel Treibitcher cabled Max that he has found a well-known doctor in Israel . He is offering to pay all Max 's expenses and fly him there . AARON Really ? But this is wonderful news . Chaim Joel is a generous and righteous man . MIRIAM ( Blunt . ) Aaron , I can not remain in America as long as Max is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help and love . I want you to accompany me to Israel . AARON No , no I can not go with the two of you . Really ( Covering . ) Anyway , I am finally writing the first good book I have written in years . MIRIAM Ah ! I know this . And what is this book about ? Do n't tell me . Does the corpse in " In the World of Chaos " finally come back to life ? AARON Exactly so . It is about you . MIRIAM Not you ? AARON ( He laughs . ) Well , yes . Of course . Me , too . We 've both come back to life . ( She glows . ) MIRIAM Write it in Israel . AARON I can not . MIRIAM Why wo n't you go ? p. 54 AARON You should be with Max . ( Miriam gets up . she pulls out a Bible . ) What are you doing ? MIRIAM Be so good as to open the Bible to the Chapter of Curses for me . ( She hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Chapter of Curses ? MIRIAM I read about it in a story of yours . ( He opens the Bible to that chapter , Deut , 27 -- 28 . ) AARON These are sacred curses . No one but the most saintly of rabbis will read this aloud from the Torah for fear of being cursed . ( Miriam lights candles . ) MIRIAM ( Very quiet , over the candles . ) I swear by God in heaven and by the souls of those dear to me , the martyrs who perished at the hand of Hitler , may his name and his memory be obliterated , that I shall have no other man in my life besides you . If I should break this sacred vow , may all the curses of the Holy Book descend on my head . ( Miriam reads the portion of curses . ) Cursed shall I be in the city and cursed shall I be in the country . The Lord shall set loose against me calamity , panic , and terror until I shall be utterly destroyed . The Lord will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my home , but I shall not live to find it . The Lord shall bring a nation against me which will swoop down like an eagle , a ruthless nation  --  that will show the old no regard and the young no mercy . I will be lost forever in lamentation because I would not serve the Lord my God . These are the terms of His covenant . Amen . ( She kisses the Bible and closes it. ) p. 55 AARON Really , Miriam . How can you take such an oath ? MIRIAM Whatever happens between us , I do n't want you to lie awake at night thinking that I 'm deceiving you with others . AARON What value does this oath have , coming from someone who does not believe in God ? MIRIAM I believe in God . AARON This is new . MIRIAM Yes . ( Pause . ) AARON Shall I also take such an oath ? MIRIAM No . You owe me nothing . I am going away from you , not you me . You may have whomever you please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was a small boy who went to cheder in Warsaw . You are like a newly married Hasidic bride and I your youthful ward . How can two candles costing pennies so alter the state of a man and a woman ? MIRIAM Tonight I married you . AARON Miriam MIRIAM Do n't worry . I wo n't force you into anything . I married you , not you me . I know that I am sinning gravely against God , against you , against Max . In the old days , I would have been ostracized or even stoned for it . ( She runs to him . ) Oh , Butterfly , it is so hard to leave you . I already miss you . I want to stay here with you , but Max is waiting for me . He is now my father . Do you understand ? He is very ill . I am so frightened . p. 56 AARON Of what are you frightened ? ( Miriam does not answer . ) MIRIAM There is more to tell you ( She touches her fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She exits . Surreal light . Music . Aaron closes his eyes . ) AARON I dream it 's Rosh Hashanah . My parents and I are all going to Tashlich together , to throw our sins into the water to be washed away . The men lead the way . My father bends over my little brother , Moishe , speaking to him softly . The girls and the women appear , all decked out in their holiday finery . I see my mother .

( As Aaron , Miriam , and Max move towards the dinner , a woman stops Aaron . Her eyes are black . Even before she opens her mouth , Aaron knows she is from Poland and a victim of Hitler . ) WOMAN Mr. Greidinger Forgive me for disturbing you . I am a reader of yours . I must speak to you about a certain matter . Can we talk ? It is urgent . AARON Yes , certainly . ( To Max and Miriam . ) You two go in . I 'll be with you in a moment .

Now comes the part I feel compelled to tell you : Miriam was in Stutthof . AARON No , no . I am afraid you are mistaken  --  WOMAN I saw her as clearly as I see you now . Miriam was one of their kapos . AARON W  --  kapos ! What do you mean ? p. 62 WOMAN What do I mean ? She worked for them . She was the mistress of the SS officer Wolfgang Schmidt . I believe you know that a Jewish girl did not become a kapo for her good deeds . Some kapos thrashed Jewish girls for the smallest sins , for being slow when called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some even helped the Nazis take children to the gas chambers . Well , that 's what I wanted to tell you . ( Silence . ) AARON Are you sure that it was she ? WOMAN She used to visit our home . I 'd recognize her a mile away .

Your hand is so cold ! AARON Which way do we go ? ( He turns and suddenly collapses , faint . ) MIRIAM Aaron ! ( She kneels at his side . ) AARON I 'm cold . MIRIAM I 'll get you something . ( Miriam runs to get help . ) AARON Ah , so this is what hell must be ( Miriam returns with a blanket and fusses over him like a devoted wife . ) MIRIAM Are you still cold ? ( Aaron nods . She tucks the blanket around him . He throus it off. ) p. 64 AARON No , I am hot . Get me some ice , some water . ( She runs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( She stops , looks at him , terrified . ) MIRIAM I am going to get a doctor ( Desperate . ) Who was that woman ? ( He will not answer . Terrified , she exits . ) AARON ( Muttering . ) Dear God she wanted to live . I can hear my mother say , " Better she should have died . " ( Lights change . Music . Lights up on Max in a wheelchair . Miriam wheels him in . Aaron stands by , uncomfortable . The next morning . ) MAX He is leaving ? Why ? MIRIAM Maxele , he has his work .

I think I feel it . MIRIAM ( To Aaron . ) I 'll come to New York later . ( Aaron will not look at her . To Max . ) We 'll all go back to America , and soon . MAX Ach I wish I could dance at your wedding . Every marriage , Aaron , is an act of tikkun . You wo n't believe me saying this but it 's true , even though our rebbe used to say it . Every good marriage helps mend the world . ( To Aaron with great love . ) So She brought you back to life ; take care of her after I 'm dead . ( Aaron brushes tears out of his eyes , kisses Max , looks at Miriam , agonized , turns to go . Worried . ) Arale ? ( Aaron turns to Max . He does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if to kiss her . Instead he takes her face in his hands so Max can not hear : ) AARON I know everything . MIRIAM ( A gasp , agonized . ) Ah ! No ( Pause . ) There was so much more I would tell you . ( She reaches for him. ) p. 66 AARON No . Do n't please ( Lights change . Aaron walks downstage . Stops . ) I feel like an old man . I 've lived through two world wars My entire family has perished I no longer live as my forebears lived . I 've severed myself from the root I am a remnant of a spiritual holocaust And Miriam I went to Israel thinking of her as my bride . And now ? All I can think about is the woman who told me a kapo I can hardly believe it . Yet I have the peculiar feeling that I have seen and heard all this before , either while awake or in a dream . The figure of Wolfgang Schmidt floats before my eyes . I hear him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks for her . ( In the shadows , the figure of Miriam slowly emerges . She holds a cable out to him . Music begins , a haunting rtigun , full of sorrow . Miriam 's voice , almost a whisper : ) MIRIAM " Please , Aaron . I hope you read this cable , even though it 's from me . Max died tonight in his sleep . " AARON Max died ? Ah MIRIAM " Forgive me , Aaron . Your Miriam . " ( Lights out on Miriam . ) AARON My Miriam It is true My Miriam . I can not live without her .

MIRIAM ( Tentative , deeply sad . ) Butterfly , if we are fortunate enough to have a son perhaps we should name him Max ( Long pause . ) AARON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no children . MIRIAM No children , but why ? ( This is very difficult for Aaron to say . He struggles with himself . ) AARON For some , marriage is an investment in the future . For us , it is about the past . What we know should not be passed down . We must be like mules . The last of a generation . ( Aaron offers Miriam his hand . After a long time , she takes it . They embrace . Music fades out. )
