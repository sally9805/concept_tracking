The Summer Milky Way contains the small constellation originally known as Scutum Sobiescianum ( Sobieski 's Shield , after the coat of arms of John Sobieski III , king of Poland ) . On most modern star atlases and constellation listings the 84th constellation in size  --  the smallest with four exceptions  --  is known simply as Scutum . Though small , Scutum 's 109 square degrees of sky are packed with millions of stars , as this area is situated along the plane of our Galaxy and is visually near the Galaxy 's core . Scutum contains many double and multiple systems , variables , dark and emission nebulae , star clusters , planetary nebulae , and the famous Scutum star cloud . Scutum fits into a pocket formed by Sagittarius the Archer to its south and southeast , Aquila the Eagle to the east and north , and Serpens the Serpent to the west . Let 's start our tour of Scutum near the center of the constellation at the 3.9-magnitude , spectral class K3 II red giant Alpha Scuti ( 1 Aquilae ) . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scutum . The 50 members of NGC 6664 are spread out and shine with an integrated magnitude of 7.8 . The brightest members glow at about 10th magnitude . The cluster is about 4,250 light-years from the Sun . On the eastern fringe of NGC 6664 lies the pulsating Delta Cephei-type variable , Y Scuti . This star 's magnitude varies from 9.2 to 10.0 during a period of 10 days . In pulsating variables , the photosphere and outer layers of the star periodically expand and contract . These heartbeatlike pulsations cause the changes in the star 's apparent brightness . Another variable member of NGC 6664 is the short-period Delta Cephei-type star , EV Scuti . In contrast to regular Delta Cephei variables , the short-period ones have visual amplitudes of less than 0.05 magnitude and their periods are less than 7 days . Regular Delta Cepheids have amplitude ranges of 0.02 to 2.0 magnitudes and can have periods as long as 50 days . Move about 30deg southeast of NGC 6664 and you 'll come to the small open cluster Trumpler 34 . This cluster contains just 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variable Delta Scuti ( 2 Aquilae ) lies about 30deg south-southeast of Trumpler 34 . Delta Scuti is the prototype for short-period variables that show slight fluctuations in their brightness during a period of less than 5 hours . In the Delta Scuti class , this fluctuation is about 0.2 magnitude or less . Delta 's magnitude fluctuates from 4.9 to 5.2 . The changes in your own local seeing during the night can cause you to see this much difference in a star 's apparent magnitude , so you will have to compare Delta with the stars around it to see if they are also changing in brightness . if these other stars do not appear to dim or brighten while Delta is changing , then you are observing Delta during one of its pulsations . Delta Scuti variables are all young stars and fit within spectral classes A5 to F5 . Unlike many of the other types of variable stars , the spectral type for a Delta Scuti star remains constant during the star 's pulsations . We know of about 100 Delta Scuti-type stars . Because these stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or near the Milky Way and generally are members of open clusters . Many of these stars appear to be short-period spectroscopic binary stars . This leads astronomers to think the rapid motion and gravitational effects of the nearby companion star may be a cause of the pulsations in the primary . Delta Scuti has two visual companions . The magnitude 9.2 C star was first measured in 1879 . This star lies 52 " from the primary in position angle 130deg . The fainter ( magnitude 12.2 ) B star was first measured in 1938 . This star can be found at position angle 46deg and has a separation from the primary star of 15 " . The Delta Scuti system is about 250 light-years away and is moving at 29 miles per second toward us . On the evening of June 20 , 1764 , French astronomer Charles Messier noticed a cluster of stars near Delta Scuti and added it as the 26th object on his list of cometlike objects . This open cluster is now designated as M26 ( NGC 6694 ) and looks like a wishbone or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center . Two curving arms of fainter stars fan out north and south of the cluster 's center . M26 has a magnitude of 8.0  --  its brightest member is a magnitude 11.9 bluish giant . The 100 stars that make up M26 are located about 4,900 light-years away . After observing M26 , star-hop about 2deg east-northeast to the globular cluster NGC 6712 . In small scopes , this magnitude 8.2 cluster appears somewhat nebulous with no individual stars visible . Larger instruments ( 13 inches or greater ) can resolve individual stars around a very dense core . The cluster lies about 24,700 light-years away . Southeast of NGC 6712 , in the same field of view , you 'll find the magnitude 15.0 planetary nebula IC 1295 ( PK 25-4.2 ) . When you view this object you 'll see that two 13.5-magnitude stars appear to be surrounded by a thin shell of nebulosity . Compared to most planetary nebulae , IC 1295 is quite large  --  it measures 86 " across . The object has a low surface brightness , so if you have a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have IC 1295 centered in a low-power eyepiece , switch to high power to get the best view of it . The heart of the Scutum star cloud itself lies south of Delta Scuti . This gigantic concentration of faint stars is visible to the naked eye but shows best with binoculars . In some parts of the cloud , the stars are so densely packed you can hardly see black space between them . This is one area of the sky you should take your time to look over and savor . On the western fringe of the Scutum cloud you 'll find a triangle formed by the open cluster NGC 6649 , the reflection nebula IC 1287 , and a 5th-magnitude star . NGC 6649 contains about 50 members in a tight grouping located 4,250 light-years away . This 8.9-magnitude cluster appears to be the hub for several spokes of dark dust lanes radiating throughout the surrounding starfield . About 30deg southwest of NGC 6649 you 'll come to the reflection nebula IC 1287 . Smack in the middle of the nebula lies the wide double star Struve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the star . Struve 2325 consists of a 5.8-magnitude , spectral class B3 , white primary and a 9.1-magnitude secondary located 12.3 " away . Look for the secondary in p.a. 257deg . F. G. W. Struve first measured this pair in 1829 when he served as director of the Dorpat Observatory in Estonia . In the northern area of Scutum is the largest of the dark nebulae in Scutum , a complex consisting of B110 , B111 , B113 , and B119a , and covering about three square degrees of sky . This dark nebula snakes its way through a rich star field . On the southern end of B111 is the bright open cluster M11 ( NGC 6705 ) , popularly known as the Wild Duck Cluster . While verifying the discoveries of his predecessors , Messier located this dense cluster on the night of May 30 , 1764 . German astronomer Gottfried Kirch discovered the cluster , however , more than sixty years earlier . About 600 stars brighter than magnitude 14.8 are visible in M11 . The cluster contains hundreds of fainter stars and is rich in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed at the cluster 's center that they may be less than one light-year apart . M11 is not part of the Scutum star cloud but is a foreground object . William Henry Smyth originated the Wild Duck nickname when in the mid-nineteenth century he recorded that phrase in an observing log . The thin black streak south of M11 is the dark nebula B318 . About 1deg northwest of M11 you 'll find the radially pulsating supergiant R Scuti . This star varies from magnitude 4.4 to 8.4 during a period of 140.5 days . The variability of this star was first noticed by the English astronomer Edward Piggot in 1775 . R Scuti is in the class of variables whose prototype is RV Tauri . These variables appear to have two alternating minima . This causes the star to have various magnitudes at its extreme faintness phases . Most of the time , R Scuti is a 5th-or 6th-magnitude star . About every 146 days , the star fades to 8th magnitude and slowly rises back in brightness . R Scuti is a large star and may be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halfway between M11 and R Scuti is the multiple star Struve 2391 . The primary is a 6.5-magnitude , spectral class A2 star . The 9.8-magnitude secondary lies 37.9 " from the primary in p.a. 332deg . This nice double is easy to split , even in small scopes . A third member of the system is a 14.3-magnitude star located 12 " from the B star . Sweep 1.5deg west from M11 to the U-shaped open cluster NGC 6683 . This cluster is hard to pick out from the edge of the Scutum star cloud . The 20 stars in the group have a magnitude of 9.5 , with the brightest members glowing at 11th magnitude . The expansive dark cloud west of NGC 6683 is the dark nebula B103 , which covers about one-half square degree of sky . The eastern portions seem darker than the western ones . In binoculars you can see twisting veins of dark matter throughout this complex . Although Scutum is a relatively small star group , it offers something for everyone . It is a beautiful sight for naked-eye observers who gaze in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvel at the Wild Duck Cluster . Telescope enthusiasts will enjoy scanning the constellation 's rich star fields and winding lanes of dark nebulae . Scutum remains one of the great gems of the summer sky .
