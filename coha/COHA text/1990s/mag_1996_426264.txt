Neither East nor West excels at sustained innovation , according to esteemed Japanese professor Hirotaka Takeuchi . Winning at the subtle game he calls " knowledge creation " means integrating apparently incompatible ways of thinking . Takeuchi , 49 , ranks among the intellectual leaders of the younger , globally minded generation that is coming to power in Japan . A professor of marketing and international business at Japan 's Hitotsubashi University , Takeuchi is teaching an advanced management course at the Harvard business school this spring . Takeuchi argues that an organization 's ability to sustain innovation-and thus revenue growth-depends on creating and spreading knowledge among middle managers . Training is n't enough , and neither is individual genius . How to get the process started and keep it going is the subject of The Knowledge-Creating Company : How Japanese Companies Create the Dynamics of Innovation ( Oxford University Press , $25 ) , written with his mentor and colleague , Ikujiro Nonaka . The book draws lessons from a study of Japanese companies with outstanding records in product development . What does " knowledge creation " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep hearing about knowledge workers-but where does the knowledge come from ? Our concern was to determine how organizations innovate , not just once or twice but systematically and continuously . Our starting point was that the innovation process in Japan is different from that in the West . And our conclusion is that knowledge creation has nothing to do with Japanese management-it 's universal . Are the cultural differences important ? Yes , because we have to learn from each other . Western companies have a major strength : One individual can quickly bring a big innovation to market . But in a company like Microsoft , you wonder where the great ideas will come from after Bill Gates . Japanese companies rely on innovations from groups of ordinary people . They depend on middle managers ' trying to push everyone in the team up to a higher level of shared understanding . That takes longer , and it 's less spectacular , but a group 's knowledge base can become a major competitive advantage . The real excitement comes when you combine the two approaches . We saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Mitsubishi , the key lesson was how good the Caterpillar guys were at putting everything they knew into a manual . At first the Caterpillar people thought the chorei - the ten-minute staff meeting that started every day-was for the birds . But gradually they realized that getting people together every morning is a major strength of this system . How does human behavior affect innovation ? We learned that knowledge creation depends on the interaction of two types of knowledge , and that each culture is most comfortable with only one . In the U.S. , people are very comfortable with explicit knowledge , the sort of information that can be verbalized , written down in documents , put into computers , and readily communicated . The Japanese do n't do that very well . They 're best at tapping tacit knowledge , which comes from personal experience and is usually difficult to express . It 's what you feel in your gut when you have a hunch or an inspiration . It 's not purely rational . Tacit knowledge is connected to emotions , beliefs-it 's more a bodily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as comfortable with that . Creating knowledge requires a convergence of tacit and explicit knowledge . There has to be a spiral from one type of knowledge to the other , and back again . How exactly does tacit knowledge apply to competition in the marketplace ? Let me give you an example . In Japan , Matsushita Electric used to be known as maneshita , which means " copycat . " Big and successful but not an innovator . That changed dramatically with the introduction of the Home Bakery , the first automatic breadmaker . A software engineer , a woman named Tanaka , recognized that with Westernization , the time had come for a breadmaker in Japan . But she knew almost nothing about baking . So she apprenticed herself to a master baker . He had all the knowledge in his fingertips , but it was very hard for him to verbalize . After watching him for two or three weeks , she went back to Matsushita to write up a set of specifications for the machine , translating his tacit knowledge into something explicit . Photograph Hirotaka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // They made a prototype , but the bread tasted terrible . So Tanaka-san brought a group of her peers to observe the baker again . Finally , they realized that what the machine lacked was the twisting motion the baker used when kneading his dough . Incorporating that understanding enabled them to develop a hugely successful product . The breadmaker changed the corporate culture at Matsushita . People in other divisions said , " Why ca n't we do that ? " How do Japanese companies get the benefit of employees ' tacit knowledge ? They work hard to create a feeling of unity . The influence of Zen makes us believe that the best state of intellectual ability comes when the body and mind become one . The ideal form of communication is known as the " breath of ah-un . " That 's when one person looks at another and says , " Ah , " and other guy says , " Un , " and that 's all they need to understand each other . No explicit verbal communication at all . Here 's how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency , the boss would invite us to a night out every month or so . We 'd get totally drunk and tell him off , airing our complaints . The next morning when we met the boss , we 'd make a little bow and say , " Ooooh , I was so drunk , I do n't remember anything . " It 's a ritual that clears the air and promotes understanding without any penalties . Another approach is to hold an off-site meeting called a gasshuku , or camp-in . Team members camp in at a hotel and exchange ideas . Barriers come down . I take my students off-site to a mountain resort with a hot spring . We 'll all be soaking together with our clothes off-it 's not coed , by the way-and the students will volunteer to rub my back . That 's how we communicate . The experience we share is symbolic of our unity . We 're all naked in the same pool together . That leads to a deeper understanding , a feeling of trust . I wonder if Cincinnati is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get more systematic about tacit knowledge ? Culturally , there are better ways to do this in the West-maybe skiing together , or going to the Outward Bound school . The key is interacting as equals , finding ways to establish human , emotional contact . Top management has to spend much more time rubbing knees with their key middle managers . Why the emphasis on middle management ? Innovation does n't require genius . In the U.S. you hear people saying middle managers are dead weight , but these people play a key role in many of the Japanese companies we interviewed . Our corporate leaders are ideal driven . It 's up to the frontline people to put those ideals into practice . When information is shared freely between top and middle management , knowledge spirals up and down the organization . Most of the successful product development we observed was done by project teams . They all work together in a tiny room for two years . Nonaka and I call it the rugby approach : Everybody is on the field from day one  --  engineers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes up , they all pile in together . That 's very different from the relay approach , in which one functional team passes the baton to the next . Project teams work when goals are very clear and they have the autonomy they need to meet them . And the participants are handpicked by top management . Sharp creates special teams for what it calls " urgent projects . " When top management decides something is strategically very important , everyone on the team gets a gold badge . If you work for Sharp , and someone wearing one of those badges asks you for mission impossible , you do it on the spot . Believe me , the people who wear those badges learn a lot . The kind of institutional knowledge we 're talking about is created when knowledge passes from the individual to the team , and then from the team to the organization . So when a project is completed at a company like Sharp , the team members return to the normal hierarchy . That gives them a chance to dump all the knowledge they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The understanding of their colleagues goes up a notch . Gradually , the experience of project teams spreads through the whole organization . That 's how you achieve continuity and repeatability . Layoffs are a fact of life in the U.S. That practice seems antithetical to the building of organizational knowledge . If you 're letting go of people left and right , you 're definitely cutting down your knowledge base and reducing trust . But some employees have a richer knowledge base than others , so if a company is forced to lay people off , it 's important to have someone around who understands that . In Japan some of the best guys go into human resources . U.S. organizations would be ahead of the game if they at least developed a human resources function that viewed people as strategic resources . Any other advice ? Americans could be much less rigid about benchmarking . The Japanese approach to product development is loosey-goosey : Top management sets the vision and mission , then lets the team run . The Western approach can be very mechanical and explicit , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The point is to achieve the mission . <p>
