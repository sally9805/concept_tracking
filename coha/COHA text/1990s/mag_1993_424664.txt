<p> On April 20 , 1993 , National Youth Service Day , more than 500,000 young people in more than 1,000 communities across the nation received recognition for volunteer efforts to improve their neighborhoods . On that sunny spring day at an event lining the White House 's South Portico , Hillary Rodham Clinton honored more than 100 community leaders , including many young volunteers from Washington , D.C. The gathering of young , eager community volunteers was co-sponsored by Public Allies and Youth Service America . <p> Described as a " domestic Peace Corps " by its 27-year-old founder , Vanessa Kirsch , Public Allies is a oneyear apprenticeship program that gives young people the chance to do meaningful public service work in their own communities and get paid for it . The program is headquartered in Washington , D.C. with a satellite office in Chicago . The first team of 15 Allies is currently serving paid apprenticeships in Washington , D.C. Forty-five Chicagoans were to be placed in paid apprenticeships in September . <p> A multicultural organization designed by young people for young people , Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new generation of leaders into organizations that work on this country 's most pressing public issues . It provides opportunities for 18 to 30-year-olds from diverse socioeconomic , educational , and racial backgrounds by placing them in positions with non-profit organizations , community development corporations , and government agencies , while also providing support , training , and public education . Funding is provided through innovative partnerships with the public , private , and non-profit sectors to support these positions to the extent possible . To become a Public Ally apprentice , a youth must have a proven record of community service . <p> Youth Service America ( YSA ) , founded in 1986 , is an independent , not-for-profit organization that promotes and supports youth service programs throughout the U.S. YSA develops and sustains a national network of quality service programs that provide young people of all ages and backgrounds with opportunities to volunteer . The YSA goal is that these youths will begin a lifelong commitment to community improvement and civic participation . Getting National Volunteer Recognition at the White House <p> The fact that the joint commemoration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony and National Youth Service Day was held at the White House reflects the tenacity of Vanessa Kirsch . After graduating from Tufts University where she was active in community work on campus , Kirsch worked as a field organizer during the 1988 Dukakis campaign and for pollster , Peter Hart . One of her projects was a survey of young people 's attitudes on civic responsibility . She concluded that many youths in their 20 's were disenchanted and did not know how to pursue careers in community service or thought that they could not afford to do so . <p> Kirsch was dismayed by the stereotype of a self-centered generation and left her job in 1991 to organize Public Allies to support young people engaged in community service . With a few other volunteers , she walked through innercity Chicago and Washington , D.C. , asking local business , community , and other leaders for the names of young people who were " making a difference " through volunteer efforts and who needed support to continue their efforts . She wrote about the concept for Public Allies in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She and her small group found donors who gave stipends to some of these youths who wanted to leave their regular jobs to work fulltime on community projects . <p> In 1992 , Public Allies was planning its first award ceremony and the Clinton campaign expressed interest in participating in the program . After Mrs. Clinton joined the ceremonies , she promised Kirsch that when her husband became president , the commemoration would take place at the White House . After the election , Kirsch reminded Mrs. Clinton of her promise and Mrs. Clinton agreed that the White House lawn was the place to salute such earnest youths and the organizations they serve . <p> Youth Service America was celebrating National Youth Service Day simultaneously during April 's National Volunteer Week . YSA combined its recognition ceremony for volunteer youths with Public Allies ' national celebration so that service-oriented youths would gain national exposure and serve as role models . <p> National Youth Service Day has been commemorated since 1988 . Its goals include : continued public awareness about youth service ; teaching communities to view youths as resources rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young people nationwide ; and creating collaborations among local programs , schools , community agencies and local governments . It is a project of YSA and the following organizations : Commission on National and Community Service , established by Congress in 1990 to engage all Americans , regardless of age or background , in service to their country ; the Lutheran Brotherhood , a fraternal benefit society with one million members nationwide ; the Points of Light Foundation , established in May 1990 , a nonpartisan nonprofit organization dedicated to mobilizing Americans for community service to solve serious social problems : the U.S. Conference of Mayors , the official nonpartisan organization of cities with populations of 30,000 or more ; and the Jefferson Awards , which has been presenting awards to Americans for outstanding public service since 1972 .

Also in attendance were celebrities involved in public service , including Keishia Knight Pulliam of " The Cosby Show " ; Andrew Shue , an actor on the television series , " Melrose Place " ; and Desmond Howard , wide receiver for the Washington Redskins . <p> Eli Segal initiated the event by emphasizing the value of public service . He affirmed the Presidential commitment to allow college students to pay off college debts with community service activities . In the past , Mr. Segal has praised Public Allies for understanding that the two principal objectives of service  --  " to address the pressing needs of our country and to positively affect the needs of the person servicing "  --  are important . <p> The real stars of the day , however , were the volunteer youths  --  both at the White House and in cities across the country . After Vanessa Kirsch 's introduction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak . A former drug and weapon dealer in Washington , D.C. , Gaddy told the story of how he had everything stripped away " until fie saw elementary school children who reminded him of himself years ago . He became a tutor and mentor to one child , Matthew , and helped the younger boy overcome reading difficulties . " I love Matthew , " Gaddy says , " and I hope he will be proud of what I have become . " <p> Sarah McLaughlin , a young teacher at Merritt Elementary School in Northwest Washington , D.C. , spoke about the importance of helping the younger generation both vocationally and avocationally . She related her own experiences helping a first grader to feel loved . <p> Maria Angela Jordan focused on self-esteem . She related how , as a young African-American girl , she felt powerless . She encouraged others by stating , " You should not just feel equal for a week but every day ... " and urged the audience to help their communities , even if that help simply takes the form of voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face after listening to the " Tomorrow 's Leaders Today " award honorees . Without a script , Mrs. Clinton closed the ceremony and stressed that " service is the rent we pay for living . " Summarizing the experiences of each of the youths who had just spoken , she explained that service is not a one-way street . " Service means you get as well as you give ; your life is changed as you change the lives of others .... It is the way we find meaning in our lives , both individually and collectively . " She spoke of how our lives are " interconnected and interdependent . " Referring to the " core values of community , opportunity , responsibility , and education , " Mrs. Clinton noted that the President 's commitment to national service is translating these values into action . She ended her presentation by asserting that the best definition of an American she ever heard was the phrase , " I can do something ; I can be something . " And Meanwhile , All Across America ... <p> While these events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Youth Service America , and other service organizations were highlighting major youth volunteer projects in hundreds of cities across the nation . YSA Executive Director Roger Landrum stated , " youth service is n't about speeches and policy initiatives . We hope National Youth Service Day will remind people that it 's really about thousands of courageous and visionary young people who have accepted the service challenge . " On or near April 20 , more than 2,000 organizations and programs in all 50 states and the District of Columbia participated in volunteer recognition ceremonies , forums , and rallies with the help and support of governors , mayors , teachers , parents , and most importantly , young people . To name a few : Following the devastation of Hurricane Andrew , several youth service conservation corps joined forces to participate in " Rebuild Miami " Phase II . From April 12-22 , about 120 corps members from Washington , California , Arizona , and Pennsylvania worked to reconstruct Homestead , Florida , one of the hardest hit areas .

More than 300 youths from Detroit , Michigan gathered for a youth summit , entitled " Today 's Heroes : Youth Serving Youth " with 40 area service organizations . City Volunteer Corps organized over 400 city volunteers and 150 other youths and adults in 40 one-day projects , such as distributing food to the needy and restoring nature trails in all five boroughs of New York City . In Little Rock , Arkansas , youth organizations around the State provided a full day of service to their chosen causes , with activities culminating in a City Speakout among all volunteers . Following a morning of service projects in Boston , Massachusetts , more than 300 youths recited a pledge during an awards rally to give back to the community . <p> Recent data reveal that teenagers volunteered 1.6 billion hours of service in 1992 . These hours represent the equivalent of 966,800 employees and a value of an estimated $7.0 billion . Fifty-three percent of teen volunteers reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What the statistics do not necessarily show is that youth service can be a powerful form of " social judo . " According to " What You Can Do For Your Country , " the January 1993 report of the Commission on National and Community Service , " When young people from different racial , ethnic , economic , and educational circumstances work together in close quarters , they come to trust each other and depend on each other , and then they begin to notice that their lives are richer for knowing people different from themselves .
