<p> ' WE did n't ask for the Braer to be wrecked here , " says George Black , one of the crofters who farm the fertile land in the southernmost part of Shetland . He adds philosophically : " All kinds of things have been thrown at Shetlanders over the centuries , but we always survive . " <p> Wind seems to be what is chiefly thrown at Shetlanders : January saw 21 days of winds continuously at gale force . These winds made it impossible for experts to do much more than look on after an oil tanker ran aground Jan. 5 . The American-owned , Liberian-registered tanker Braer bottomed close to the shore at Garth 's Ness near the foot of this 70-mile- long group of islands - the most northerly land in Britain . The winds and gigantic waves broke up the Braer , dispersed the oil out to sea and up the coastline , and sprayed it over the land . <p> Some 85,000 tonnes of light crude oil , en route from Norway to Quebec , spilled , with an unspecific amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an unfamiliar problem : The resulting contamination of farmland , in particular , is unusual if not unprecedented . How to cope with this livelihood-threatening development , when sheep and cattle have to be kept off grass and vegetables are condemned for human consumption , is challenging a welter of local and government departments and officials , the claims office of the Norwegian insurers for the tanker , and the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund set up at Lerwick , Shetland 's capital . No one believes that the complex maze of enquiry , damage assessment , and compensation through which affected Shetlanders are now obliged to walk is going to be quickly navigated . <p> Crofters are n't the only ones who have been thrown into the ensuing maelstrom of concern about long-term effects . Two other important industries on Shetland , fishing and salmon farming , are also disrupted . Oil has tainted about 20 percent of the salmon farming on Shetland . The stock now almost ready for marketing will be destroyed . Some salmon farmers , wanting a clean slate , are also calling for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salmon may grow out of the toxicity and become salable in due time . <p> Also , nobody is willing to say what method should be used to dispose of the slaughtered fish . The Shetland Islands Council is impatiently waiting for the Scottish Office of the British government to make such decisions , but the Scottish Office seems as reluctant to decide this as it has been to release results from scientific tests of slaughtered sheep in affected areas . Some Shetlanders accuse the government of dragging its feet ; others are more tolerant , acknowledging the bureaucratic and scientific complexities involved . <p> The tourist industry , though bringing less money to Shetland than fishing and fish-farming , also fears consequences from the Braer disaster , because it depends largely on the attraction of the islands ' pristine wildness . It is seeking funds to launch an image-improving advertising campaign . <p> The islanders find themselves caught between the need to downplay the disaster ( so that people will not be put off buying salmon or coming here to see the spectacular bird population during the breeding season ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been affected by the spill ( in order to make sure compensation is adequate . ) <p> John Goodlad , Secretary of the Shetland Fishermen 's Association , is outspoken on the need to " keep things in proportion . " <p> " This claim of ' ecological disaster , ' this ' wildlife devastation , ' is absolute rubbish , " he says . " It 's not a disaster . It would have been ... if one of the crew of the Braer had lost his life . Nobody 's lost their lives . " <p> But Mr. Goodlad believes that in the fishing and fish-farming industries , " now we are beginning to see the real effect . Jobs are on the line . The real problem is real people . Not furry animals . " He says this because he feels strongly that journalists , who descended in vast numbers along with officials and experts on Shetland , have exaggerated the effect of the spill on wildlife . <p> So far scientists have collected 1,500 dead birds . Future monitoring , however , may indicate longer-term effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . <p> " After the Exxon Valdez spill there were 600,000 birds killed , " Goodlad says . He 's " very sad " about the Shetland birds , but notes that " hundreds of thousands of birds breed in Shetland , and no single species of bird is in any danger of extinction or of having its numbers reduced drastically . " <p> Goodlad also says the 300-square-mile fishing-exclusion zone around the southern part of the islands established after the spill " affects 10 percent of the whitefish trawling ground and about 20 percent of the shellfish ground . For everyone else it is business as usual . " <p> Fisherman David Smith believes that fishing is " not going to be affected so badly " as crofting and salmon-farming . " We hardly ever fish within the exclusion zone , " he says . The oil spill is not high on the fishing industry 's agenda of problems . <p> Retired crofter Derek Black , whose son now works his farm , is not so optimistic about crofting in the affected part of Shetland . His veterinarian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have no stock on it until at the earliest June or July . " " We honestly do n't know what we 're going to do " with their sheep , Mr. Black says . These animals are confined to a very small area unaffected by the oil and are being given special feed paid for by the Shetland Islands Council , but when their numbers more than double during the spring lambing time , overcrowding seem certain . " There 's a very strong feeling to sell the lot , " he says . The family has considered selling completely and moving out . Black 's rich humor and zest for life , however , belie such a pessimistic scenario . <p> " Where we would go , I do n't know , " he says , adding , " At the moment , life is going on as near to normal as it can . The bottom line is how the local population is going to cope . I would think you need to come back in six month 's time to see . " <p> Frankly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop me from doing that . These beautiful islands are , in spite of this untoward occurrence , wild and attractive and full of both human and bird life , even at the southern point . I even watched a seal bobbing around what little of the wreck now remains above the blue waves . <p> This creature did not show signs of any distress . A large wave reared up and seemed to swamp it . After a moment 's disappearance , there
