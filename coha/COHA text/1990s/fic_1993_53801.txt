This is my tale about the Vietnam War ; at least I think it qualifies . This story , however , comes no nearer to Phnom Penh than 10,000 miles : blame this lack of action on my year of birth  --  1954  --  and blame it on my gender . A muddy river does appear later on in this story , and you 'll see a few guns , and on a marshy bank , wild grasses will whip at my bare legs , but there will be no leeches , no shrapnel , and no one in this story will be called Charlie unless it is his mother-given name . <p> I got my first menstrual period on the same day that Lyndon Johnson was reelected . I remember this date clearly because my mother was working as a poll-watcher for LBJ 's campaign , and when I came home from school at noon , bleeding from my genitals , I had a hell of a time searching for the new sanitary belt that I knew Mom had bought for me and hidden somewhere in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belts , back in the days when not many women entered the military for reasons such as  --  if I understand the military mind correctly  --  the existence of sanitary belts . <p> I spent three hours bleeding onto wads of Kleenex that I crammed into my underwear , and was much relieved when Anna , my eldest sister , came home from her last class at the commuter college that was the only place my folks could afford to send her . But when I opened my mouth to ask her to give me some help , she brushed by me , slammed the door m her room , and burst into loud , wailing tears . I retreated to the room I shared with my younger sister , Lynn , distracted from my own trauma by Anna 's uncharacteristic outburst . <p> My sister Kathleen , the second oldest , came home at 4:15 after pom-pom-team practice . She helped me find the pads and belt , though the whole setup was so bulky and awkward that I soon reverted to using wadded-up Kleenex . Kath avoided the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , and they still do n't  --  after I told her about Anna 's tears . <p> " She never cries , " I said . <p> Kath shrugged . " It might do her some good , then . " <p> " Maybe you should check on her , " I said . " Make sure she 's not dying or something . " <p> She shook her head . " I 'll get supper started . " Dad always got home at 5:15 , and so we always ate at 5:20 . With Mom gone , Kath became the cook . Anna was hopeless in the kitchen . <p> I was always closer to Anna , anyway , so I finally found the courage to knock on her door and ask to come in . <p> She was lying on the bed , crossways , wiping her face on her pilled cotton bedspread , which had once been white . Its color now was an uneasy compromise between yellow and gray . She sat up , no longer crying , but red-eyed , puffy-faced , and miserable-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoved my bare toes down between the bedframe and box springs . Now that I was here , I did n't know what to say . We were n't a very demonstrative family ; we did n't talk about our sorrows with each other ; we never hugged . We were half-Dutch Methodists , and at one time I thought that might be the reason why we did n't act anything like the gushing TV families that had been popping up on prime-time shows . But by this age , I knew that our next-door neighbors  --  the ones we liked , the ones with kids  --  were melting-pot Baptists and they did n't act any different than we . So it was n't religion or lineage that made me just sit there dumbly and pick at my cuticles . <p> " I broke up with Danny , " Anna finally said Danny was the bass player in a local rock band she followed . He had a Fender bass and shining black hair that hung over his eyes so that I could n't even tell what color they were . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Oh , " I said . <p> " He thinks I was talking too much with Mark . " <p> Inside the bedframe , my toes were going numb . I liked the feeling . I was one of those kids who spent hours spinning around in circles just to make myself dizzy . " Who 's Mark ? " I asked . <p> " He 's the drummer of this other band , Blackie Z. " <p> " Oh , " I said . " Is he cute ? " <p> " Mark ? " The fake-innocent way she said his name made me I think that Danny had been right to be jealous . " I guess so . " The way she said that made me sure of it . <p> It was less than a month later when Mark first came over , and I considered him a real improvement over Danny . He talked to me , for one thing , like I was a real person . I could see his eyes , for another . He came over more often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers with him . I was his favorite  --  other than Anna , of course  --  in our family . Eventually , I got to go with the two of them out to Mark 's hometown , riding in a battered Chevy that smelled strangely sweet all the time , an odor I would later be able to identify as low-grade , home-grown marijuana . <p> Mark had grown up on a large farm about fifty miles from our town , in German immigrant country , next to the river . Berger Township had forty farm families , one Catholic church , and just two paved roads that formed a single intersection known to the locals as " in town . " On every corner of the crossroads stood a tavern , each with Anheuser-Busch beer on tap , each with an old , round-topped jukebox and nicked-up tables that sat empty . " Do n't sit there . Those are saved for the euchre players , " Mark told me . He could bring a ten-year-old kid sister into the bar with no problem  --  he himself was only nineteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . <p> He was blond and blue-eyed behind thick glasses , and broad-shouldered . All his seven brothers looked just like him , except the even-numbered ones had perfect vision and no glasses . There was Mark , then Matthew , who would be the first of them to go to Vietnam . Bobby , John , Michael , Peter , Luke . And James , who was Lynn 's age , and who was born missing a finger from each hand . They were wild boys , rough boys , boys who had borne up through farm accidents and fights . They all liked each other in an unrestrained and rowdy way that my sisters and I never would have been allowed to duplicate . <p> The Vietnam War began to escalate soon after Mark and Anna met . I knew of the war mostly from television . I knew , too , that Mark changed his major to engineering to get a draft deferment and dropped out of his band to keep his grades up . I knew that his brother Matthew joined the Marines as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to train , and then to Asia . I heard about body counts on television . But those were n't facts that affected me . They were background noise , part of the voice-over to my childhood , like the endless reports on the ups . and downs of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton 's relationship . <p> What I did know  --  personally  --  about the Vietnam War was this : ! spent dim winter Sundays with Kathleen , fixing boxes to mail to " our boys "  --  really just some anonymous platoon number she 'd picked off a list at church . I helped her bake chocolate chip cockies . Kath knitted mittens , and tried to teach me how , too . I fumbled my way through one pair , then went on to popping batch after batch of popcorn to use as packing material . The address that Kath printed on the finished package was like no address I had ever seen . It seemed to be in some secret code . <p> Anna did n't take part in Kath 's baking projects . Anna was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the most radical thing they did was listen to MC-5 records while planning to bomb the Oakville Post Office , which was the only federal building in town . They were all liberal arts majors , however , so none of them knew how to build a bomb . They all knew how to talk about it , though . <p> The first time I went out to Mark 's family 's house itself was almost two years after he came into our life . Anna did n't go with us  --  maybe she was at a White Panthers meeting . It was just me and Mark . I forget how we got to be friends , and I see now that it must have looked funny to some people that he was hanging out with his girlfriend 's little sister , but there was nothing but innocent liking between us . We both liked shooting pool . We went fishing together . We both liked football . His parents disliked my sister , as they disliked all their sons ' girlfriends , but had no reason to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had once possibly been yellow , but it had faded to about the same non-color as Anna 's bedspread . Rickety steps led up to an aluminum back door . Inside , the little house had a sour smell , of spoiled milk and urine , that seemed to come from everywhere . <p> I sat huddled in the corner of the dilapidated sofa , holding a jelly glass of lemonade Mark 's mother had handed me wordlessly before disappearing back into the kitchen , like a rich person 's maid . While Mark talked with Luke , I watched seventeen-year-old John and his father exchange words . A tiny black-and-white television set droned on in the corner . <p> Their father , Clint , said , " It 's time to bring the cow t'barn , son . " He swigged a can of Bud . He had an enormous beer belly . <p> From his spot in front of the television set , John said , " Oh , Pa , that cow can find her own way home . " <p> Clint got to his feet quicker than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you sass me , boy . " <p> " But I 'm right ! " <p> The old man slammed down his beer , sloshing some onto a veneered end table . He picked John up off the floor . John was a strong boy , a guard on the varsity football team . Without any apparent effort , Clint tossed John into the wall . A cloud of white plaster dust puffed out around the boy 's shoulders . As he struggled to his feet , I could see a new crack in the plaster next to the doorway . The ugly room swam in focus for me : suddenly there was meaning in all those other holes in the walls and doors , messages in the drooping door hinge , in the splintered rocking-chair arm . <p> Mark 's mother did n't come running into the living room . Mine would have . I gripped my glass more tightly and refused to meet anyone 's eyes . On the TV , a special on the war began , and Clint sat down to watch it . John left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't help but notice that none of the GIs on TV were wearing mittens . To be honest , it looked a mite warm in Southeast Asia for mittens . I wondered if they 'd ever gotten the cookies we baked , if whoever opened the boxes ate the popcorn or just threw it out . <p> On the drive home that night , I said to Mark , " I was surprised about John and your father . " <p> " What about them ? " <p> " The argument they had about the cow . " <p> " Oh . Yeah , " he said . " Y'know , John was right . " <p> " Huh ? " <p> " That dang cow has been led back to the barn every night for the past fifteen years . She 'd have made it back on her own just fine . " <p> That was n't the point I had meant to make , but I just let it pass . I knew I had just visited a foreign place , a house where no one acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difference that went way beyond that between Methodists and Baptists or Catholics . I wondered if they ever made popcorn at the farmhouse . I wondered , for the first time , how Matthew was getting along in the war . <p> I never got a chance to ask . He was killed in combat that same winter . <p> When the draft lottery was next picked , Mark 's birthday came up 107 . He signed an employment agreement with an aerospace firm in Seattle , an agreement that included a guaranteed draft deferment . He proposed to Anna , and they were married right after he graduated . I cried at their wedding . <p> His brother Bobby 's birthday had been drawn as number two in the lottery . I suppose he could have gotten out of the draft somehow  --  perhaps because of Matthew  --  but either he did n't know how or did n't want to try . Bobby came back from basic training to be best man at the wedding , laughing and grinning throughout the whole evening , having a boisterous good time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given leave , that he 'd gone AWOL to make it to the wedding . Bobby also saw his girlfriend that weekend and got her pregnant . <p> At the reception , Clint bragged on Bobby . Standing there in his white shirt and clip-on tie , looking about as natural as a cow wearing a tuxedo , he also talked about Matthew as if he were some damned saint . I remembered Matthew as being a lot like John  --  and I remembered the night that Clint had hit John . <p> The week after their wedding , Anna and Mark moved to Seattle . The next year , Kath eloped with a boy from high school who was in the Coast Guard in Maine . I grew up and took a lot of drugs , which was at least as much fun as spinning around in circles until I got dizzy . My mother got elected County Clerk , and Dad learned to eat dinner at 5:40 . My little sister , Lynn , ended up being an okay kid  --  we did drugs together every now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both pretty much quit . <p> The war ended , the U.S. slinking home with its tail between its legs like a whipped dog . Nixon resigned the summer between my high school graduation and college . I went to the same commuter college as Anna had , and majored in Government . There I met professors  --  all men  --  who were passionate about the subject of the Vietnam War . I got into a lot of discussions with them about " isolationism " and " self-government " and " imperialism , " and I never thought to contribute to the conversation by mentioning Matthew or Bobby  --  who Anna said had come home in one piece , but " weird "  --  or Kath baking cookies or my mother 's stint as poll-watcher for Johnson in ' 64 . None of that seemed as though it had anything to do with the war , or with the grand political theories that my professors espoused . <p> In my senior year of college , Anna and Mark moved back from Seattle , Anna saying , " I hope I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mark started working on his master 's degree and we began to hang out together again . <p> On a muggy Saturday just after I graduated , Mark took me to the family farm again , to hunt for morel mushrooms . At dawn I waited for him on the front porch of my rented duplex . The sun was just a vague gray light tucked into the hollows of the hills to the east . Mark picked me up in his old Chevelle and drove me out to the country , over the river , and to the farm . He steered the Chevy through weathered gates and on behind the farmhouse , now painted a peeling white . I waited in the car , spinning the radio dial and hearing nothing but static . <p> Mark came out of the back door with his nephew , Bobby 's son , here for his custodial every other weekend . He was named Matt after his dead uncle . The boy carried a shotgun . Bobby trailed behind , empty-handed . I barely recognized him . He wore jeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so dirty it looked almost brown , and it was stringy and long . It clung to his thick neck and slipped down inside the collar . He walked stiffly , his eyes tracking any motion around him on an oddly delayed schedule , as if his brain were processing everything he saw a bit too late . Watching him gave me the shivers . <p> His son helped him get into the back seat , and the boy greeted me politely  --  he had obviously learned his social graces somewhere other than here at the farm . Bobby said nothing . I do n't think he knew me . <p> Mark drove us back to untilled acres of the farm , where the brothers had once grown their marijuana . He had brought his good shotgun along and his old over-and-under for me . Why hunting mushrooms required a gun , I did n't know , but I took the damned thing , though I held it awkwardly , as if it were a snake . Bobby had no gun , and I was glad of that . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneaking up the brush-covered rise , pausing , pointing , shouting , " There 's one of them suckers now ! " and  --  blam !  --  blowing the mushroom heads to kingdom come . Spores would flutter down over the hapless brown squirrels cringing on their thick tails . <p> We split into three groups  --  Bobby and Matt stuck together  --  and Mark briefly described the mushrooms to me . " You just got ta learn to see them , " he explained : this was the whole of his advice to me . I scuffed along , alone , scanning the ground , looking for odd , tiny objects that I 'd never before seen . I learned to see the woods  --  really see  --  that day for the first time . I remembered , as if from another life as a tracker , about tiptoeing between dead sticks . I saw the layers of brown rot blanketing the ground . The wet smell from young birches filled my lungs . Touching a vine here , bracken or lichen there , I tracked the killer mushrooms through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to find a patch . " Beginner 's luck , " Matt said , disgusted . The three of us filled paper lunch sacks with the tall , striped dwarf-caps of fresh morels . Bobby stood back and stared with a vacant look . <p> When we got back to town , I phoned Anna . " Why did n't you tell me ? " <p> " About what ? " she said . <p> " About Bobby ! Christ , what a ghoul ! " <p> " I forget , " she said . " It 's something we 're not supposed to talk about . My in-laws pretend like he 's completely fine . " <p> Two weeks or so later , Mark asked me to go back to the farm with him to fish . I hesitated , thinking of Bobby , thinking , too , that I was having a bad menstrual period and cramping something fierce , but at last I agreed . The next morning at dawn , he drove us down the curves of Old Frankfort Road to a tiny bait store . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led me in side . <p> The bait shop was a smelly , dirty little place . Mark loved it . He stood and traded lies with the beefy , red-faced owner while I peeked into the row of aluminum bait tanks . They looked like a giant 's ice cube tray . Some had chicken wire over them , to keep chirping crickets prisoner ; some were filled with water and such a dense concentration of writhing minnows that I wondered how they could stay alive . Other cubes were topped with cardboard ; underneath was dark loam threaded with worms . There were two sizes of crickets , two of minnows , four varieties of worms , from the tiny red wigglers up to fat , sluggish night crawlers . I rested my hand on my aching belly and watched the glittering movements of the minnows , considering how they and I were connected on the food chain . I needed them , it seemed , but they could easily do without me . <p> We escaped the wet chewing-tobacco smell of the shop with two little Styrofoam cartons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : some days were just red wiggler kind of days . <p> We parked at the farmhouse , and Mark ran inside for a quick hello while I gathered up our gear . We walked down a hill to the equipment barn and rode a flaking green tractor over the rough ground to a pond . We passed Bobby , who walked the grounds like a ghost . <p> Mark picked the pond : Long Pond today instead of Little Pond . His decision depended on the stock , who had fished it recently , the rains for the past week . He always knew which pond to choose . I knew by now that he spent hours on the phone each week with his father and brothers discussing fishing and hunting conditions , but as a kid I had suspected he had some kind of arcane talent , like ESP . Bobby 's eerie presence must have made me remember that . <p> Mark showed me , for at least the fifth time , how to slip my hook under the spine of the minnow just so . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have him . " I tried . The minnow was wet , slick . I stuck him on the hook , wrenched him around a bit , then cast . The weighted line flew southeast , the minnow northeast . <p> When I finally got the hang of it , I cast as far as I could . Twice , I hooked Mark on my backcast . He never once yelled at me for it . I caught less fauna than flora . " Moss bass " is what Mark called the hunk of green I kept peeling off my line . Why could n't my hook like minnows the way it liked weeds ? <p> I bottom-fished because it kept me busy . I cast , felt that click deep in the reel where I never had bothered to untangle an impossible monofilament knot . In the mirror of Long Pond , the sinkers dropped through the sky , rippled the reflected trees . I slowly  --  slowly  --  ratcheted the line in , taking care to keep it just taut enough to feel a fish-sized tug . How long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the sport for me , not catching fish . Over and over : cast . . . crank slowly , fighting boredom . . . then giving into it , hypnotizing myself with the country rhythms . <p> When my line was hit , I was jolted , had forgotten I was fishing at all . Mark let me keep whatever I was willing to clean . There are no game limits when you 're on your own land . <p> We both caught a fair amount of bass  --  pulled from the water with their eternally indignant expressions  --  and flat blue gill and sunfish . I cleaned the fish on an old board that I set on the wet bank . The weeds scratched at my legs . I decapitated each wriggling fish , wondering as I did so if it felt any pain . Scaling fish required the same skill as peeling potatoes . As I scraped the serrated blade over the headless fish , scales flew into the air , stuck to my fingers , my face , my bare feet . I looked as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was as close to wearing makeup as I 'd ever come . <p> As I was cleaning the fish , Bobby came along , holding a pint bottle of bourbon . He stared at me for a while . Then Mark walked up and began to talk to his brother . <p> " How 's the old man ? " he asked . I did n't hear Bobby say a word . But Mark went on as though he 'd been answered . He asked about the milo crop , he said Matt was turning into a good little hunter . I glanced at Bobby once , and he was looking down at the ground , digging his toe into an ant hill , rubbing the back of his neck with a corner of the whiskey bottle . <p> " All finished , " I said , standing up . <p> " Want a ride back up to the house ? " Mark asked Bobby . His brother gave a little shake of the head and Mark nodded . <p> " See ya , Bobby , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . His voice was soft , shy . He sounded like a five-year-old . <p> Mark picked up a big bagful of fresh corn before we left the farm , and we took it and the fish back to town . Mark , Anna , Lynn , and my folks and I ate fried fish , the sweet corn , and tomatoes from Mark 's garden for supper that night . Afterwards , we played lawn games . Mark liked to play killer croquet , an endless version of the game that prized sending the other player 's ball as far away as possible over Dad 's neatly trimmed lawn . Usually I 'd get into it with him , but that night I was n't in the mood . I tried to send his ball once , but the anticipation of the crack of the mallet against the wood made me flinch . It was just enough of a hesitation to ruin my shot . His ball rolled only about ten feet . <p> " God , what a pussy ! " he said . It was how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was something in his smile that reminded me of Bobby 's old smile , though the last time I 'd seen it was on the night of their wedding . I realized then that Mark could have been Bobby , or Matthew , that his draft number could have been number one . I wished , with a sharp , painful kind of longing I 'd never felt before , that we were the kind of touchy-feelie family that I saw all the time now on television . I wanted more than anything right then to tell Mark how i knew 1 had the best brother-in-law in the world . But I could n't do it . I 'm ashamed to admit that I still ca n't . <p> Anna called last week and told me that Matt 's wife died , horribly , in childbirth , hemorrhaging to death in the back seat of their car . Since this last war , I 've been remembering these years , these scenes , that war , Bobby . For some reason , Anna 's news brought it all into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley now . Great fishing country , and I do n't mind the rain clouds at all . I do n't get back home very often , and I have n't seen Bobby in years . Anna says he 's much worse , though I ca n't even imagine what that might mean . <p> I do n't understand much more about the war now than I did in 1968 , when I was fourteen . I 'm just a female , and I 've been told I therefore have no place writing about this  --  or any  --  war , not even from a 10,000-mile-distant perspective . And hell , I do n't know  --  maybe this story is n't about the Vietnam War at all . Or maybe it is ; maybe it 's me still knitting mittens , sending them to secret-code addresses , trusting that some stranger can find a use for something I made back home . <p> <p> By WENDY COUNSIL <p> WENDY COUNSIL 's fiction and poetry have appeared in The Amherst Review , The San Francisco Bay Guardian , and The Hawaii Review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Amaranth review , the Chiron Review , and Free Lunch .
