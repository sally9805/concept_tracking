So you think you 're Star Trek literate just because you know that phasers can stun and that while Klingons used to be bad guys , now they 're good ( most of the time , anyway ) . But can you decipher the techno-babble that Enterprise crew members are constantly spouting ? For some help , TIME consulted Michael Okuda , one of the Star Trek technical experts : <P> " We need to remodulate the main deflector dish . " <P> Deflectors are devices that protect starships by setting up an energy field . Dishes , which operate at specific frequencies , control the deflectors . Remodulating the frequency boosts the strength of the deflectors against incoming attacks . <P> " We can do it if we reconfigure the lateral sensor array . " <P> Sensors are used to detect objects , life forms or anomalies in space . Reconfiguring them simply adjusts them , like focusing a lens . Watch for terms like " reconfigure " and " remodulate " ; they 're the workhorses of the Trek vocabulary . <P> " It should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transporters can send people instantly from one location to another by converting their molecules into energy , then reassembling them . Every living being has a distinct pattern of molecules ; the pattern buffer fixes the configuration by adjusting for the Doppler effect  --  the apparent change in the frequency of the energy waves caused by motion . <P> " I 'll verify the Heisenberg compensators . " <P> The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that you can not know a subatomic particle 's exact position and its exact direction and velocity at the same time . To transport people you have to know all those things , so the Heisenberg compensator was devised to overcome that problem . It 's an attempt by the Trek writers to signal that they are at least aware of the issue . And how does the Heisenberg compensator work ? " It works very well , thank you , " says Okuda.
