The Lure of the Tall // If a single building type can  --  and should  --  be identified with twentieth-century American architecture , it is the skyscraper . Tall buildings were the stuff of the stories told by the legions of European immigrants whose first glimpse of America was the southern tip of Manhattan Island , bristling with its forest of towers . Those buildings remain a symbol of American corporate power . They are , after all , the way Americans explain how high Superman can leap in a single bound . // For a study of twentieth-century American architecture , it would be convenient if the first such building had been built precisely in 1900 . To locate the roots of the type , however , one must cast back a bit into the century before , when the idea of the tall building was only beginning to emerge , and was threatening architecture in the United States  --  and indeed the rest of the Western world  --  with profound change . // In an article for Lippincott 's Magazine written in 1896 entitled " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguably the most influential architect of his day , issued a challenge that would resonate through architectural history from that moment on . The tall office building , Sullivan declared , " must be tall , every inch of it tall . The force and power of altitude must be in it . It must be every inch a proud and soaring thing , rising in sheer exultation that from bottom to top it is a unit without a single dissenting line  --  that it is the new , the unexpected , the eloquent peroration of most bald , most sinister , most forbidding conditions . " // Like so many architects before and after him , Sullivan was an energetic  --  if not always grammatical or especially coherent  --  writer , and he rejoiced in his own verbiage . In this passage he seized with remarkable accuracy upon not only the central architectural fact of his time , but also its spirit . The emergence of the tall building as an architectural type was an unprecedented opportunity , yet it was also somewhat frightening . Indeed , it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture " and establish the unchallenged power of American design for at least a century . // Of course , height had been an obsession with architects going back to the obelisks of ancient Egypt . But only with the coming of iron and steel as structural materials in the early nineteenth century were designers able to escape the inherent limitations of masonry and brick . As a rule of thumb for architects of those days , a one-story masonry building required a twelve-inch-thick wall , and the thickness at the base had to increase by four inches for each additional floor . Thus a stone building of sixteen stories required walls six feet thick at the base to support the load of the upper stories ; at twenty stories , the walls at the base would have to be more than seven feet thick . // Thanks to the pursuit of metal technology  --  especially by bridge-builders like John and Washington Roebling  --  the impulse to go ever higher could be indulged almost without limit , at least in theory . Metal beams could span great distances , and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metal members freed the building 's skin from its support role , permitting much larger windows , as well as much greater and more flexible interior spaces to meet the growing demand for offices and factories . // In fact , however , a serious obstacle remained to the exploitation of metal technology in building . Generally speaking , five flights of stairs was the maximum most people could be expected to climb , and it was virtually impossible to demand rent for space above that level . Thus , while it was technically possible to create much taller buildings , there was no practical use for the additional space . All that changed with the introduction of the passenger elevator . // Lifts and hoists of various types had existed for decades , but they were used primarily for hauling equipment and stores . In 1857 , however , the first practical passenger elevator was installed in New York in the Haughwout Store , designed by John P. Gaynor , at Broadway and Broome Street . At a stroke , the tall building was flung open to those who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new device was the Equitable Life Assurance Building , also in New York , designed by Gilman &amp; Kendall and George B. Post and finished in 1870 . Despite the new amenity , the building remained at the traditional limit of five stories . Driven by rising real estate prices , which obliged owners to squeeze ever greater square footage out of their sites , architects and engineers soon began to investigate the larger potential of the elevator . Prominent among those architects was the durable Richard Morris Hunt , who had ministered with such vigor and skill to the residential fantasies of the rich , but proved no less willing to embrace an office tower . His Tribune Building ( 1875 ) , facing New York 's City Hall Park , rose to a dizzying nine stories , and George Post 's nearby Western Union Building ( also 1875 ) outdid that at an even ten stories . // Thrilling as the prospect of increased height was to many architects , it was at the same time something of an artistic threat . While dazzlingly tall , the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were essentially smaller buildings living beyond their aesthetic means . The standard approach to the architecture of these increasingly tall structures was to make them look like amplified short ones . The Tribune Building culminated in a corbeled clocktower reminiscent of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence , while the Western Union-which also included a clocktower  --  sprouted dormers and decoration worthy of the roof of a luscious country mansion . The result was a family of misshapen buildings whose ornament might have been appropriate to a Newport " cottage " used for vacations , but to some eyes was monstrously out of place at a greatly increased scale . // This dichotomy was natural enough , given the training of the architects . After all , many of the most prominent practitioners had studied in Europe , most at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris , where they had been steeped in neoclassical monuments . They and their colleagues were used to looking for precedents in architecture , and in their case precedents meant Europe . There had certainly been nothing in American architectural history to provide a competing set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the European architectural models on which they had been trained , many American architects of the day dealt with the problem by embracing the organizing principle of the classical column , with its three-part division into base , shaft , and capital . Thus the bottom few stories would be embellished with arches or multistory windows topped by a heavy cornice ; the intermediate floors would be virtually identical ; and the upper portion would be given a flamboyant culmination by adding a " hat " of some vaguely Gothic or Renaissance sort . // The form persisted for years , and while the height of buildings increased , the aesthetic treatment of them remained tethered to the teachings of the European monumental tradition . Although the results included some impressive objects  --  among them Daniel Burnham 's Fuller ( Flatiron ) Building ( 1903 ) , which employed the base-column-capital formula with powerful effect on a triangular New York City site  --  they more often verged on the silly . New York 's Singer Building , finished in 1908 to the designs of Ernest Flagg , sported a bulbous mansard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buxom dowager at a Paris ball , while the Metropolitan Life Tower ( 1909 ) , by Napoleon LeBrun &amp; Sons , gave passers-by a taste of Venetian campaniles , but in such overscaled measure that it was bound to cause some architectural indigestion. // One should not be too harsh on the early New York skyscrapers . At their best , they were wonderfully romantic and entertaining , and at least one , the Woolworth Building , by Cass Gilbert ( 1859-1934 ) , achieved truly aesthetic , as well as physical , heights . This 1913 landmark , which was the tallest building in the world at the time and was instantly dubbed the " cathedral of commerce " for its Gothic cladding , succeeded not just for its theatrical impact , but for the skill with which its architect handled its massing and proportions . The office block that constitutes the lower portion is seamlessly integrated through the use of slender terra-cotta piers with the tower , which soars to 792 feet . Together , the elements convey a formal resolution that removes it from its gaggle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depended for its impact on its ornament , without which the basic form was unwieldy ; Woolworth , on the other hand , could be stripped of its Gothic details and yet stand as a satisfying composition . Without the ornament , the Woolworth would be a very different building , but one senses that Gilbert had succeeded so well in his organization of the forms that he was almost ready to shed the cladding as unnecessary . He had , in the end , all but exhausted the ornamental tradition for the tall building of his day . // The Woolworth marked the highest expression of what might be called the early picturesque skyscraper , and for that reason has remained a classic of its kind . But its terminal quality hardly put an end to efforts to outdo it in opulence and ornamental complexity . What was missing from it and virtually all of its spiritual contemporaries before and after , however , was any underlying sense that height and the technology that made it possible created an opportunity for a fundamentally new form of expression , one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and short ones held up by stone or brick . Although the earliest New York skyscrapers employed cast-iron columns in some cases ( they all used cast-iron beams ) , the walls were still of load-bearing masonry . The later ones made increasing use of metal framing , but their architects chose not to express it in the exterior treatment of their buildings . Indeed , the Woolworth in this sense is no nobler than its lesser rivals , which made every effort to conceal what they were made of and how they were supported . // Although New York was late to grasp the fact , this aesthetic impasse had long since been broken by the fire that devastated Chicago in 1871 . The disaster began with a small blaze that broke out at 9:00 P.M. on the night of October 8 and spread until it engulfed virtually the entire city . By the time it was extinguished 48 hours later , the fire had consumed 18,000 buildings , killed nearly 300 people , and left 100,000 more homeless . The downtown area was leveled , and total property damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // The disaster focused attention on the one remaining problem confronting the use of metal as a structural material : fireproofing . Exposed to concentrated heat in a fire , unprotected iron would , as numerous Chicago buildings had demonstrated , buckle and eventually collapse . In the early 1870s , however , engineers successfully experimented with a number of fireproofing techniques , including the use of hollow tile for subflooring and partitions , and the direct application of masonry and tile to exposed iron columns and beams . // The Chicago fire created a tremendous opportunity for the city . Most of the buildings that had been destroyed in the conflagration had been made of wood . The instant demand for new construction that would withstand such a calamity in the future forced builders and architects to come up with new techniques . Now that it was possible to use fireproofed iron and steel in place of wood and masonry in a building 's structure , owners and architects alike turned to the new materials with more than simply technical enthusiasm . // Economics , too , fueled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaces in which to house the armies of accountants , secretaries , and executives it was spawning . An office culture was now inextricably joined to that of the mill and the factory , and new and more flexible working environments were called for . In Chicago , that need intersected with the urgent necessity to rebuild on a massive scale , and together those forces concentrated attention on the center of Chicago 's downtown business district , known as " the Loop " for the elevated railway tracks that encircled it . // Not surprisingly , real estate prices soared , creating even greater incentives to make maximum use of small sites than had been the case in New York . Within a year after the fire , prices for downtown Chicago lots had already surpassed the levels established before the fire , spurring developers to strive for the most square footage on each parcel . Between 1872 and 1879 , some ten thousand building permits were issued by Chicago authorities . And over the decade of the 1880s prices for a quarter-acre of prime downtown real estate zoomed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , owners and architects naturally preferred to go up , rather than to spread out . // For all the pressures to move beyond the architectural traditions of the past , the leap probably could not have been made with such vigor anywhere else in the United States except Chicago  --  with or without a fire . Retaining much of its frontier spirit ( Chicago was originally named Fort Dearborn ) , the city was especially attractive to entrepreneurs , adventurers , outcasts , and industrial buccaneers . Many of the men who " made it " in Chicago  --  the Armours and the Swifts among them  --  were industrialists who literally made things , and did so with a combination of brute force and all-American optimism . When the actress Sarah Bernhardt visited Chicago at the turn of the century , she declared that in this city beat " the pulse of America . " It has been called America 's " Second City " ( after New York ) , and the " Windy City " ( after the fierce blasts off Lake Michigan ) , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of Big Shoulders . " // By the time of the great fire , Chicago had become the hub of the largest system of inland waterways in the world , providing it with access by ship to the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico . Its position astride a network of railway lines amounting to nearly 11,000 miles of track linked it to both the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts ( the city 's railway terminals handled an average of 350 trains every day ) . What in the 1830s had been a humble settlement with 100 inhabitants , a collection of rude dwellings , and one saloon had , 40 years later , achieved a population of nearly 300,000 people . // For all its wealth and energy , however , Chicago could not escape a feeling of cultural inferiority in its competition with New York , and manifested an almost compensatory determination to surpass its Eastern rival . Given Chicago 's relative youth , the city should be given credit for substantial achievement in that effort . Contrary to much historical lore , Chicago in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own . The Chicago Historical Society was established in 1856 , and by the time of the fire the city boasted 68 bookstores , or roughly one for every 4,400 inhabitants , and a large library became an essential part of the home of even the most philistine of industrialists . The Chicago Academy of Design , the precursor of the Chicago Art Institute , was founded in 1866 . Nonetheless , Chicago 's identity as a provincial city forced it to make comparisons to its Eastern competition , whose cultural elite persisted in dismissing the midwesterners as arrivistes. // In the realms of drama , music , and the plastic arts , there was considerable substance to the easterners ' disdain , but in architecture New York 's cultural " superiority " actually proved to be a fatal disadvantage in the competition for leadership . So wedded were most of the leading Eastern architects to the traditions of Europe that they simply could not see beyond the precedents on which they had been raised . And many of those who chose not to play by the traditional rules defected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became associated with the " Chicago School " were Eastern refugees , most of them from New York or Boston , and they helped create a community that took a uniquely chauvinistic pride in the architecture that defined the city 's reconstruction . // One of the most influential of the first-generation Chicago architects was Daniel Burnham . The man who was to become the master of ceremonies for the World 's Columbian Exposition had been born in western New York State , the grandson of a Congregational minister and the son of a wholesale druggist who moved to Chicago to improve on a record of business failures . Young Burnham had hoped to make his way as a merchant , and briefly tried mining before turning to architecture in 1872 at the age of twenty-six , joining the local firm of Carter , Drake &amp; Wight . There he met John Wellborn Root , who had been trained in part by James Renwick , the architect of Grace Church and St. Patrick 's Cathedral in New York City . Burnham and Root went into business for themselves in 1873 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the firm got off to a shaky start , but it eventually flourished , as did Burnham 's ambition . The portly and rather pompous Burnham ( who was widely known as " Uncle Dan " ) is quoted as having declared to Louis Sullivan at one point , " My idea is to work up a big business , to handle big things , deal with big businessmen , and to build up a big organization , for you ca n't handle big things unless you have an organization . " // The firm 's accomplishments ranged from the unexceptional ten-story Montauk Building of 1882 , to the hefty block known as the Rookery ( 1888 ) , with its airily elegant iron-and-glass dome hovering above a three-story light court . But the most memorable of their early works was without doubt the Monadnock Building . Completed in 1891 , it rose sixteen stories on the southwest corner of Jackson and Dearborn , and with its slope-sided base and unembellished facade it presented a crisply sober  --  almost ominous  --  shape to the city around it . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , which looks remarkably " modern " in retrospect , but the fact that it was built in conventional masonry fashion . Indeed , the reason the building 's walls were so much thicker at the base  --  seventy-two inches  --  was that otherwise it could not have supported the rest of the structure . Although their colleagues were already experimenting with metal , Burnham and Root remained tied to stone , in much the way Richardson had been in his later buildings . And like Richardson in his houses , these two architects pushed masonry just about as far as it could go in a tall building ( and to accommodate the great weight , developed an innovative foundation system that replaced the traditional pyramid of stone with a leaner platform of concrete ) . The Monadnock remains the tallest building ever constructed with brick walls . From that point onward , height would have to be achieved by accepting the new materials . // The architect who did that with the earliest and greatest ingenuity was William Le Baron Jenney ( 1832-1907 ) , who has traditionally been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also an easterner ( he was a native of Fairhaven , Massachusetts ) , Jenney had been educated as an engineer at the Ecole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures in Paris , where he became familiar with the innovative French research being conducted in metal-framed and fireproofed commercial and exhibition buildings . During the Civil War , Jenney became a major in General William Tecumseh Sherman 's corps of engineers , studying the mechanics of bridge building and the structural properties of iron . A proud man , who could exasperate those who worked for him , Jenney insisted after his discharge on being addressed by his military rank . // The " major " arrived in Chicago in 1867 and set up an architectural office the next year . His first significant work was the Leiter Building , a five-story structure completed in 1879 and expanded by two stories in 1888 . It was nothing to speak of as a work of high design , but in his skillful combination of wooden floor beams and cast-iron columns , Jenney was beginning to probe the possibilities of an all-metal frame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1885 , that brought to Chicago the most fundamental element of skyscraper construction : an entirely metal structure from which the external cladding could be hung in " curtain " fashion . The Home Insurance Building was no more alluring to look at than the Leiter , but it set a new standard for structure . Clearly , there was no longer any reason to use masonry as anything more than a skin . // In the end , though , Jenney 's contribution to the progress of the tall building was a most entirely in the realm of construction rather than in aesthetics . ( His justly famous Manhattan Building of 1890 is a landmark more for the innovative system of wind-bracing Jenney developed than for its looks . ) His architecture bears the mark of an earnest intelligence animated by the solving of technical problems , but unfired by the challenge of form . Critical as they were to the history of design , most of Jenney 's buildings remained blocky and ill-proportioned and were marred by an awkward overlay of ornament . He himself seems to have tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical achievements after solving the problems posed by the Home Insurance Building . Although his so-called Second Leiter Building ( 1891 ) was a substantial achievement , it had scant grace and gave no useful direction to those followers in search of a high-rise architecture that aspired to more than function . // Nonetheless , the training Jenney provided to his younger employees gave those with a taste for the art of design a firm grounding in the necessities of construction . In this sense , like Hunt before him , Jenney 's influence was communicated by more than his architecture . At one point , his staff included Martin Roche and William Holabird , who later joined forces to make substantial  --  if workmanlike  --  contributions of their own to the Chicago portfolio . Among their finest work was the 1893 addition to Burnham and Root 's Monadnock Building , an addition that adhered to the original 's form , but was constructed on a steel frame , providing in one building a striking transition from the methods of the past to those of the future . // Another Jenney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his own following the premature death of his partner , and quickly recognized his former employer 's technical achievements . But Burnham was able to augment them with a measure of aesthetic sensibility . His fourteen-story Reliance Building , completed in 1895 , showed that he was not at all trapped by the masonry tradition that he and John Root had brought to such noble heights in the Monadnock Building only four years earlier . Making full use of metal framing , Burnham created a minimalist cage whose openings he filled with an elegant version of what came to be known as the " Chicago window "  --  a wide fixed pane of glass flanked by two narrower ones that could be opened for ventilation . ( More than two-thirds of the surface of the street facade was glass . ) Even today , the Reliance stands out as a graceful and knowledgeable expression of its own structural realities and the artistic uses to which they could be put . // But after the Reliance , Burnham , too , let slip the thread of innovation he had been holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Columbian Exposition , he chose to spend his later days pursuing the monumental opportunities that the extravaganza threw open to him , creating in 1909 the vast Plan of Chicago , a neo-Baroque scheme for his city that compared favorably with Baron Haussmann 's plan for Paris ( but included no skyscrapers ) , and leaving to others the challenge of integrating art and the new technology . The man who accomplished that with nothing less than historic impact was another former Jenney employee : Louis Sullivan . // Sullivan had been born in Boston , where his father taught dancing , and at the age of sixteen enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study architecture . The architecture program  --  the first in the nation  --  had only recently been established , by William Ware in 1868 , and its curriculum was based closely on that of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris . Even as a boy , Sullivan had shown little patience with traditional schooling , and , dismissing MIT as " but a pale reflection of the Beaux-Arts , " he left at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed some hands-on experience before tackling the real thing , he spent that summer in Philadelphia , where , on the advice of Richard Morris Hunt ( to whom he may have had an introduction from William Ware at MIT ) , he soon found himself working for the redoubtable Frank Furness . // At the time , Furness was at the height of his powers , and Sullivan was suitably impressed , not just by the energetically creative architecture coming out of the Furness office ( the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts was then under construction ) , but also by his employer 's single-minded stylistic irreverence and his skill as a draftsman. // That skill was especially apparent in Furness 's treatment of ornament , for which he had derived a highly personal and ornate system based on contemporary French and English designs . Judging from the spectacularly inventive ornament Sullivan himself was to develop as a mature architect , one can only assume that the example set by Furness had an especially strong impact . // In retrospect , Sullivan seems to have had an unerring sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his art . After a year with Furness , who was hit hard by a financial panic , Sullivan went on to Chicago to join his parents and his brother , Albert , who had moved there from Boston , and took a job in the offices of William Le Baron Jenney . ( Lore has it that the rather cocky Sullivan , in seeking a satisfactory office , roamed Chicago 's streets looking for a building that interested him . He singled out Jenney 's Portland Block , and promptly offered the firm his services . ) This , too , proved to be a brief interlude , but it could only have been an enlightening one . Having come from the aggressively artistic Furness office to Jenney 's hard-core , engineering-based environment , Sullivan was absorbing the most powerful work being done in the country at that time . But he evidently felt that what the United States had to offer  --  even at the feet of the likes of Furness and Jenney  --  was still not sufficient , and that he needed to test architectural education at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Europe , and that fall , just nine years after Henry Hobson Richardson had left , Sullivan himself prepared to enter the Ecole des Beaux-Arts to study with the best architectural faculty Europe had to offer . // To prepare himself for the Ecole examinations , Sullivan engaged tutors in French and mathematics . The mathematics tutor , a man named Clopet , made a profound and long-lasting impression on the aspirant by insisting on solutions that , as Sullivan recalled them with appropriate typographical emphasis later in his autobiography , were " so broad as to admit of NO EXCEPTION ! ! " Sullivan 's own biographers have , with reason , suggested that the appeal of this all-embracing declaration launched his later search for a comparably definitive pronouncement on architecture , culminating in his oft-quoted ( and just as often misinterpreted ) declaration in his 1896 essay on tall buildings that " form ever follows function , and this is the law . " // Despite the wisdom dispensed by Clopet and his colleagues , the Ecole struck Sullivan as suffering from a " residuum of artificiality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furness or Jenney . ( However , he never lost the attraction he acquired in Paris for suits of the most elegant cut . ) After spending the winter of 1874-75 in Paris , Sullivan set out for Italy , where on a visit to the Sistine Chapel he was apparently overwhelmed by the power of Michelangelo 's frescoes . Persuaded that he might follow the example of an artist he called " the first mighty man of Courage . . . the first mighty craftsman , " Sullivan returned to Chicago . There , he briefly found work with a friend he had met in Jenney 's office during his earlier Chicago days , John Edelmann , who was by then on his own designing a synagogue , and ( perhaps on the strength of the new man 's description of the Sistine Chapel ) put Sullivan to work designing the frescoes. // Edelmann eventually rejoined a firm for which he had worked some years before and introduced Sullivan to one of the partners , a German immigrant named Dankmar Adler , who was twelve years older than Sullivan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commercial work . ( He was especially admired for his acoustical engineering . ) Adler took Sullivan on , giving him assignments that were at first those of an office helper and draftsman , but his greater talents quickly became apparent ; within a year , the relative newcomer was offered a one-third partnership in the firm , and a year later he was elevated to the rank of full partner . Under the new arrangement , Adler retained responsibility for the engineering and business sides of the operation ; Sullivan took over design . // The work produced by Adler and Sullivan during their first decade together was hardly extraordinary . It included conventionally eclectic residences for well-off Chicagoans eager to display their prosperity in Queen Anne mansions , as well as a number of office and warehouse buildings of no particular distinction , either artistically or technologically . // At the time , of course , the most progressive American architect was still Richardson , and Sullivan , who had grown up in Boston and followed Richardson to Paris , was intensely aware of the older architect 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opening , in 1887 ( a year after Richardson 's death ) , of the Marshall Field Wholesale Store in Chicago . Writing years later in his collection of essays entitled Kindergarten Chats , Sullivan described Richardson 's building in anthropomorphic terms : " Here is a man for you to look at . A man that walks on two legs instead of four ... broad , vigorous and with a whelm of energy  --  an entire male . " Just how much the Richardson legacy meant to Sullivan became clear in 1888-89 with the design of the Walker Warehouse , a foursquare utilitarian building that , despite its taut neoclassical garb , revealed a heavy debt to Richardson 's massing . But Marshall Field 's full impact emerged soon afterwards , when Sullivan and Adler were in the midst of designing the Auditorium Building . // The site for the Auditorium , which was begun in 1886 and completed in 1890 , covered a half-block on Michigan Avenue , an area roughly the size of Richardson 's site for the Marshall Field Wholesale Store . From the start , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an auditorium , but also space for offices , a hotel , and a restaurant . The early schemes for the building included a tower with a mansard roof and a frosting of the sort of Queen Anne and Romanesque ornament the firm had used before . But as Sullivan came to appreciate the underlying simplicity of Richardson 's form ( and as the client pushed for economies ) , he gradually peeled away the trimmings , leaving a sturdy ten-story block from which sprang a seven-story tower . The organization of the facade elements owed much to Richardson : The bottom floor was pierced by squat arches trimmed in rusticated stone , while the middle stories were linked by four-story pilasters culminating in arches , and the top three stories were articulated by smaller windows grouped in pairs and threes . The tower loomed above them in neo-Renaissance fashion , providing , in addition to a dramatic focus for the composition , new offices for the firm of Adler &amp; Sullivan . // At first glance , the Auditorium might be taken merely as a work of compositional homage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sullivan 's treatment had little of Richarson 's boldness , relying more on surface embellishment than mass to convey its impact . The legacy of Richardson 's fondness for massive forms marked the Auditorium as a building of the past , but its comparatively lighter facade  --  a mere surface over a metal frame  --  betrayed a desire to break free and rise higher . // With the availability of the steel frame  --  to which Jenney , Burham , and others were already devoting much attention  --  Sullivan could make good on the challenge Richardson had chosen to avoid . And with the Wainwright Building in St. Louis , completed in 1891 , Sullivan launched American architecture on a course toward aesthetic and technological dominance for decades to come . In the Wainwright , Sullivan ( who later declared that the basic scheme for the building had been worked out " literally in three minutes " ) dispensed with the neoclassical details ( although not the base-shaft-capital organization ) on which he had relied so heavily in the Auditorium and the Walker Warehouse , and allowed the new building 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facade . // In his 1896 essay , Sullivan declared that the frame must be " the true basis of the artistic development of the exterior . " In fact , though , the vertical elements that gave the Wainwright its feeling of vertical thrust were only partially expressions of the underlying steel cage . There were twice as many piers as there were structural columns behind them , leading some later critics to attack the architect for " faking " his facade . And in this they renewed the argument that had raged with such peculiarly American intensity through the Greek and Gothic Revival periods over what was " honest " architecture . Of course , if Sullivan had been more literal-minded about his use of piers , his building would have lost much of the visual impact his solution provided ( it was accentuated by recessing the spandrel panels between the columns ) , and in that sense the architect was certainly striving for effect over fact . On the other hand , the essential quality of the overall design is the expression of the vertical properties of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen as being absolutely " true " to the idea of the Wainwright . // The argument is related to the one over which building deserves the title of the first true skyscraper . If the inclusion of a passenger elevator is used as the sole criterion , then Hunt 's Tribune Building would probably take the prize . If the standard is the use of a fireproofed metal cage structure , the winner must be Jenney for his Home Insurance Building . But what has come to be known as the skyscraper has always had more to do with the sense of height than the facts of construction , and if the spirit of the building is the issue , then Sullivan 's St. Louis entry is the clear champion . Whether or not it was a " pure " expression of structural form , it was a summation of all the other requirements ; but most important , in it the architect marshaled all of these devices to convey the feeling of height . // Sullivan refined that feeling in his Guaranty ( later Prudential ) Building in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly articulated base , he attenuated the piers ( but still used twice as many as were necessary to express the vertical steel members ) , finished them neatly at the top with arches , and provided a sort of architectural " full stop " above each with a small circular window . The midsection , which has a lean , Renaissance lightness , was topped by a heavy cornice that restrains the building 's dramatic upward thrust from appearing to go on indefinitely . Bold achievement that it was , the Guaranty also documented one of the major unresolved issues facing contemporary architects of tall buildings . Sullivan could not devise an effective transition between the base and the midsection , leaving one to sit upon the other in an almost literally disembodied fashion . // Nonetheless , in almost every other way , Sullivan had , with the Wainwright and the Guaranty , loosed the bonds inherited from Richardson . // He had faced the potential of steel-frame construction , and mastered it . He had rejected the stylistic conventions of the past  --  whether those of the Ecole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had triumphed where such Chicago colleagues as Jenney and Burnham had hesitated , in giving full artistic expression to a revolutionary technology . And it is that achievement that seems to be embodied in the deathless declaration about form ever following function . // Those few words have caused tremendous problems for many of Sullivan 's chroniclers , particularly those of a doctrinaire Modernist persuasion , who have never been quite able to deal with his enduring devotion to ornament . It was the one area in which Sullivan appeared tied to tradition . Although most of the overtly classical details had vanished from his work shortly after the Auditorium , the fascination Sullivan conceived in Furness 's office with designs based on natural forms remained with him . In the Wainwright , he filled the panels separating the vertical piers with a richly varied series of floral patterns . In the Guaranty , he extended the ornament to the surface of the piers themselves . In his Schlesinger &amp; Mayer Department Store ( later the Carson Pirie Scott ) , in Chicago , of 1904 , Sullivan turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizontal , creating a building so spare in its organization that it seemed a preview of Modernist developments forty years later ( although the site and size of the building seemed stronger motives for the shape than any devotion to pre-Modern horizontality ) . But at the entrance he produced a thicket of metal ornament so intricate and delicate that it seemed almost to shudder in the gusts of Chicago 's famous wind . Significantly , scholars who saw a proto-Modernist in Sullivan always preferred photographs of the building that emphasize its horizontality , while obscuring the ornament that the architect felt was such an important part of the whole . // Unlike some of his later critics , Sullivan did not see a conflict between his search for structural truth and his devotion to ornament . On the contrary , he saw them as inextricable , and said so many times . In fact , his definition of the " function " that the " form ever follows " included the demand of the eye for uplifting diversion , and of the heart for inspiration . Emotion was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mechanical efficiency . Nor was his system of ornament in any qualitative way inferior to his overall spatial and compositional sense . At its best , it was sublimely beautiful . But just as Richardson 's dedication to historicism seemed to be steadily eroded by the insistent pull of his geometry , Sullivan 's ornament seemed increasingly irrelevant to the industrially based architecture that was developing in his own hands . Despite his commitment to nature , the sculptural forms of the buildings themselves were beginning to take over the most powerful visual role , leaving the ornament in an increasingly subservient position . // The dichotomy became clearer as Sullivan was forced to husband his architectural resources . Worsening economic times and growing family demands persuaded Dankmar Adler to leave the partnership in 1895 for work as an executive at an elevator company . His sortie in search of more money failed , but when he decided to return to architecture , Sullivan would not have him . Evidently angered by Adler 's departure , Sullivan chose to shun his former partner , and subsequently went out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( In late 1895 , Sullivan published the plans for the Guaranty Building , but left Adler 's name off them . ) The absence of Adler 's sturdy talents became steadily more apparent , and combined with the poor business climate , it contributed to a dramatic falloff in Sullivan 's production . Between 1880 and 1895 , the two men had produced more than a hundred buildings together . In his remaining thirty years , Sullivan would produce a mere twenty . // Prominent among them was the Bayard Building on New York 's Bleecker Street , completed in 1898 . It was Sullivan 's first major commission since Adler 's departure , and , despite his renown , it was to be the only building he designed for New York City . Crowded by a host of banal commercial buildings , it is hard to appreciate the elegance of the Bayard  --  or Condict , as it became known after a later owner . But even from the cramped perspective of a narrow New York street , the lightness and elegance of the facade organization is immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he established in the Wainwright and Guaranty buildings by using piers of equal width , Sullivan in the Condict alternated the major piers with thin ones , linking them at the cornice with arches and oculus windows topped by reliefs of winged maidens . For those who would describe Sullivan as a protofunctionalist , this building is especially hard to accommodate . But coming in the wake of his leaner and better-known office buildings , it can only be seen as a more mature work . And since it is so frankly lyrical in its decoration , it would seem to be an indication that ornament  --  no matter how much it seemed to conflict with functionality  --  was becoming more than ever an integral part of his design vocabulary . // That direction was confirmed by a series of small banks Sullivan designed for several Midwestern cities in the first years of the new century . To be sure , these were not the commissions of his choice . The combination of an ailing economy , the loss of Adler and his business and engineering skills , and an almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' wishes , had reduced the great man to accepting almost any work that came along . // The banks could not have been simpler as programs or as forms . All were essentially squat rectangular boxes housing banking rooms and public spaces . But their exterior embellishment took Sullivan 's fascination with ornament to new heights . Indeed , the decoration in some cases threatened to overwhelm the underlying architecture , particularly in the banks for Grinnell , Iowa , and Sidney , Ohio , where the eruptions of terra-cotta foliage and pure geometry might as well have been freestanding panels . ( They evoke simultaneously the " false fronts " of Western frontier towns and the sort of signage that Robert Venturi would describe decades later in his discussions of the " decorated shed . " ) // But these late works , for all their jewel-like intensity , had limited impact beyond the shrinking circle of Sullivan 's loyalists . The World 's Columbian Exposition had been an instant sensation with the overwhelming majority of those who saw it , and many of the visitors went away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authoritative office buildings and banks that looked like " strongboxes , " as Sullivan described his own buildings , but of neo-Gothic office towers and banks that looked like Roman temples . The " White City " so dazzled the audience for architecture that those practitioners willing to embrace its message  --  Charles McKim , Cass Gilbert , and the changeable Daniel Burnham  --  became arbiters of taste for nearly half a century . // Sullivan , of course , would have none of it . Although the innovative Transportation Building he and Adler had designed for the fair had attracted international attention ( models of it were exhibited in Paris and Moscow ) , the American public was clearly more interested in the instant " authenticity " of architectural fantasies , and Sullivan grew increasingly embittered by the eagerness of his colleagues to provide them . He mocked the most powerful practitioners of the day  --  McKim , George Post , and Burnham  --  who , not surprisingly , shut him out of the New York and Chicago architectural societies that were such a fertile source of commissions . Sullivan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Institute of Architects , and grew ever more vitriolic in his criticism of what he saw as aesthetic backsliding . In a speech to young architects at the Chicago Architectural Club on May 30 , 1899 , Sullivan declared : " You will realize , in due time , as your lives develop and expand and you become richer in experience , that a fraudulent and surreptitious use of historical documents , however cleverly plagiarized , however neatly re-packed , however shrewdly intrigued , will constitute and will be held to be a betrayal of trust . " And in June 1900 , he described the current architecture of steel frames hidden under classical cloaks to a meeting of the Architectural League of America as " the offspring of an illegitimate commerce with the mongrel types of the past . " // Although Sullivan concentrated his attacks on the architectural establishment , he might almost be seen as trying to sublimate a frustration within his own artistic being . While his skyscrapers pointed directly toward an aesthetic defined by materials and technology , his poetic nature could not abandon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is as if the original suspicion of beauty harbored by the Puritan founders and the conflicting lure of the romantic as seen in the works of Andrew Jackson Downing and Alexander Jackson Davis had taken up residence in the same soul  --  with an almost inevitably disastrous effect . Without dipping deeply into psychology , one might characterize Sullivan 's dualistic impulses as a sort of artistic schizophrenia . And the almost evangelical fervor with which he condemned his colleagues might be seen as an expression of the frustration he himself evidently felt at his inability to resolve the conflicting demands of the elemental and the decorative . // As his personal fortunes diminished , Sullivan became steadily more reclusive , moving to humble quarters in a Chicago hotel . His marriage , in 1899 at the age of forty-two , had never taken hold , and ended officially in 1916 when his wife , from whom he had been separated for years , formally divorced him . A brief resurgence of the old energy brought some young architects into his office , but the work did not sustain them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sullivan  --  always quick to take a departure as a betrayal  --  even more embittered . Before long , he was reduced to having his meals at his club paid for by friends ; his once extensive library of architectural works had shrunk to a few volumes , which he stored in his bathroom . A special indignity was visited on him when the owners of the Carson Pirie Scott store decided to add to the building , and hired Daniel Burnham to do the job . Sullivan could take cold comfort in the fact that Burnham decided temporarily to leash his enthusiasm for the classical and virtually copied the original ( extending it by several bays and thus ironically amplifying the building 's later appeal to Modernists ) . // In 1920 , Sullivan was evicted from the two-room office in the Auditorium to which he had already been forced to retreat from his once grand quarters on the top floor of the tower . His health declined with his fortunes , and on April 14 , 1924 , at the age of sixty-seven , he died of kidney and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions to architecture would have to wait until the arrival of Modernism in the 1930s and 1940s , when it became increasingly clear that Sullivan , as no other architect  --  European or American  --  had been the first to bring art and technology into something approaching a symbiotic union . But even as he slid into temporary eclipse , Sullivan 's influence was being perpetuated by one of his former employees . // Sullivan had hired Frank Lloyd Wright early in 1888 during work on the Auditorium Building , and the two developed an intensely personal and professional relationship . Wright eventually became foreman of the thirty designers in the office , but , in classic Sullivan fashion , the relationship ended abruptly when the older man discovered that Wright had been moonlighting . Nonetheless , Wright remained devoted to Sullivan , and , as his mentor 's career declined , was one of the few to stand by him , writing frequently to cheer Sullivan up and enclosing the occasional check to help cover the rent . // But if Sullivan 's example endured through Wright , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made Sullivan for a time America 's most prominent architect . At first , Wright had little use for tall buildings . He was , however , devoted to the private house in both its formal and philosophical dimensions . While the skyscraper phenomenon was pursued with varying degrees of success by others of Sullivan 's heirs , Wright was to catch the crest of a wave in residential design and create a revolution of his own at the domestic scale .
