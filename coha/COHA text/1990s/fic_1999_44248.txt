Stuck in an airport ? Read this . It could be worse .... <p> " I 'm sorry , sir . Your flight 's been delayed again- " R.William Kroosew , Director of the Department of Astrodynamics at the University of New Cleveland on Canopus IV , dropped his suitcases wearily to the floor . " What is it this time ? " The bioid flight attendant behind the counter wore a crisp blue uniform with a gold Pan Galactic Spacelines badge pinned to its lapel . It looked like a buxom young human female with too much scarlet lipstick , and impossibly red hair styled in a cute pageboy hairdo . The only clue to its artificial origin was that " her " mouth did n't move when she spoke , but remained fixed in a toothy smile . Behind her an electronic display stretched thirty meters upward showing flight information in countless Galactic languages . Kroosew squinted at tiny green letters saying , " Flight No. 13856 . Departure Time : 1313 GST . Destination : Omegamons III . Status : DELAYED . " The attendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ion storm in the Cirrus system . I 'm linked to the spaceport 's Primary Artificial Intelligence Network , and will inform you immediately when PAIN notifies me of your flight 's new estimated departure time . " Kroosew stroked the back of his head fretfully , then noticed the clump of greasy gray hairs stuck to his palm . His hair had been full and mainly brown when he 'd first arrived here . Now he was afraid to look in a mirror . He grumbled , " We 've been through the same thing for a week now . Every day it 's another excuse . Yesterday you said the flight was delayed because of a meteor shower near Cumulus VIL The day before that , the starship 's FTL drive blew a fuse . And the day before thatwhat was it ? " " An attack by space pirates , sir . Kroosew 's eyes shot up in frustration at the transparent " ceiling " far above them . Thousands of distant gemlike stars shone suspended in solemn splendor against the velvety blackness of space . They sparkled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge islandlike spaceport suspended in a lonely void , twenty light-years from the nearest star . A silent , soothing window into the majesty of the cosmos . Then his gaze returned to the chaos around him . The waiting area stretched to the horizon , bulging with travelers from myriad Galactic Union worlds . A motley mob of sentients and protosentients raucously hooted , whistled , flapped wings , or expelled scents at each other in conversation , while others chased after immature specimens of their kind . A few somehow managed to hibernate , scrunched into one of the seats extending in long parallel rows throughout the area . But many more were engaged in noisily chewing , sucking , enfolding , or tearing various foodstuffs ( some of it still alive ) , or using portable electronic devices emitting a deafening , eye-straining riot of sound and holo images . Here and there small puffs of smoke rose above the teeming throng , either from small fires primitive sentients were using to cook their food , or the native plants that even less civilized beings were smoking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent , limb-ripping , fluid-spurting combat over which of them would claim one of the rare unoccupied seats . The attendant murmured reassuringly , " Pan Galactic Spacelines , your " On Time , Some of the Time " spaceline , apologizes for any inconvenience you may be experiencing . I hope the hotel accommodations PAIN arranged for you during these delays have been satisfactory . " " Frankly , I 've had more agreeable bedmates than the Denebian slimeweasel you put me up with last night . It kept trying to make a nest for itself by yanking out hairs from a very sensitive , private part of my body ! " The attendant smiled sympathetically . " If it 's any consolation , sit , the Denebean spoke with me a short time ago . She said she enjoyed your company . " " Well , I did n't ! Do you realize how important it is that I get back to Omegamons as soon as possible ? I 'm the head of a research team there working on a critically important scientific project . We 're on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do , it 'll be the most important discovery in recorded history ! But I do n't suppose you have any idea what I 'm talking about . " The bioid stared blankly back at him like a mannequin . No , I did n't think you did . Then her face brightened . " On the contrary , Dr. Kroosew . I just consulted PAIN 's exhaustive scientific database . After reading your outstanding textbook on the life cycles of stars , I did a search on the keyword " imaginary matter . " Summarizing the 19,413 journal citations I reviewed , its existence was first hypothesized by Professor Hzabigolboob of Tau Ceti II in Standard Terrestrial Year 3139 . It would have the characteristic of " variable quantum density ' - of changing its elemental composition and increasing its mass in response to psychic energy directed at it by sentients like yourself . " She continued , " As you so eloquently described in your recent article in the Journal of Imaginary Research , the ph mary importance of imaginary matter is that it could be used to modify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts like yourself is that the total density of " real " matter in the universe is insufficient to halt its continuing expansion since the " Big Bang . " Approximately one quadrillion terrestrial years from now the cosmos will contain only the remnants of burned-out stars . " However , if imaginary matter exists , it may be possible for sentients to " will " the total amount of matter present in the universe to increase . Given a sufficient amount of mass , and hence gravitational attraction , the universe will stop expanding after billions and billions of years , then begin to contract . Eventually it would collapse in the so-called " Big Crunch " and , in theory , explode again to form a new universe capable of evolving life . " Kroosew 's jaw dropped . " That'sright . My team 's been investigating anomalous variations in the mass of Omegamons . The natives of its third planet have religious rituals where they make offerings to their sun , which they consider a deity . When they do , the star 's mass increases significantly-as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And an excellent job your team is doing , sir . I found thirty-three citations for papers on imaginary matter listing you as coauthor , second only to Professor Hzabigolboob himself . " " Actually , " he " turned back to a " she " last month . Her team is also at Omegamons , competing with ours to be the first to prove imaginary matter exists . Whoever does it first-well , let 's just say there 's a lot of prestige , grants , and other pleasant things at stake . " The attendant 's voice was velvety . " I understand , sir . Ill do everything I can to ensure you reach Omegamons as soon as possible . " She pointed to the glowing red number- " 213-39585 " - on her PGS badge . " As a Model 38-24-36 Baryonic Intelligence Multiform Biosynthetic organism , I had a basic expected operational life , of 130 terrestrial years at the time of my original synthesis . This badge shows how many years I 've been in operation . How much , to use an archaic Terran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The number changed to - 213- 39586 . " Uh-excuse me , but are n't you out of warranty ? ' " " No , sin Since first coming " on-line , " I 've been extensively modified with selfrepairing nanites which keep me operating at peak efficiency at all times . Thus , no matter how long it takes for your starship to come in , I 'll still be operating at peak efficiency and able to inform you of its arrival . " Thank you for telling me more than I wanted to know . Sighing , Kroosew hoisted his bags back up . " I guess this means another night at a hotel . " " That might not be necessary , sir . PAIN informs me there 's a nonzero chance your flight may be ready for departure shortly If you 'd wait in this area for now , I hope to have good news for you soon . Or perhaps you might sample the tasty treats sold at the fine multispecies restaurants in the 4,913 concourses adjoining this gate . " " No thanks , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had enough overpriced junk food lately to last a lifetime . That hot dog I ate three hours ago is still giving me indigestion . " " Did you perhaps purchase it at an eatIng establishment called " MakDaizees ' ? " Kroosew frowned . " I think so . " " I 'm afraid that particular restaurant does n't cater to the dietary needs of humans , sir . What you consumed was not a " hot dog " in the conventional definition of a cylindrical membrane containing bovine , porcine , and equine proteins. it was a xelxa-a compact colony of coprophagous parasites used by the natives of Lactomagnyzia V as a laxative . " " Parasites ? " " Do n't be alarmed , sir . The solid waste matter in the human intestinal system lacks certain nutritional elements they require . Fortunately , however , before they starve to death , they 'll leave the lining of your colon squeaky clean . " As Kroosew walked queasily away the attendant called after him , " Should you change your mind about having another snack , please avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrons might mistake you for part of the buffet . " There were no empty seats in the waiting area . Kroosew trundled Ins two suitcases down row after row , futilely searching for somewhere to rest his enervated body . As his endless quest continued he amused himself by thinking up creative curses and anatomically impossible suggestions for those responsible for his predicament . First and foremost , the GrAnt Review Committee at the university They were the ones who would n't be satisfied with a standard F11. holo conference call , but had demanded he return to New Cleveland ( unofficial city motto , " The Error by the Sea of Zairrer " ) in person to explain " irregularities " in his research team 's budget . The direct flight from Omegamons to Canopus IV had n't been too bad , except he was famished by the time he arrived . Being served only a tiny bag of pretzels and cup of sweetened carbonated water on a flight spanning 13,413 light years was n't quite enough to satisfy his stomach . But , a bioid attendant on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Frequent Flyer " plan , he needed only 121,398 more light-years to qualify for a free trip one way to Pheeses 11 , home of the largest stinkspice mines in known space . His meeting with the Committee start ed out disastrously . After they accused him of embezzling 13.689 gigacredits from university accounts , he regained consciousness and demanded to see their proof . One of the committee 's multispecies members pointed with its pseudopod to the spreadsheet displayed on a holoscreen . " Figures and computers , " it splotzed , " never he ! " Subsequent investigation , however , revealed a programming glitch had made the ultra-advanced , quantum-tunneling , parallel-processing nanochips in the university 's main computer believe that one plus one equated two million . A recalculation using pencil and paper showed his accounts did , in fact , balance . The Chairthing of the Committee shrugged its equivalent of shoulders and blurpled at him , " Never mind . " Then there was that oh-so-helpful travel agent who 'd booked him on this return flight . " The next direct flight to Omegamons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Causidician chirped . " But , if you do n't mind a brief layover , I can schedule you for a flight that leaves tomorrow to Nineveh 6 , Pan Galactic Spacelines " main hub spaceport . It 's way out in the middle of nowhere , but you can catch a connecting flight there that goes right to Omegamons . " Brief layover indeed . Kroosew wondered what color the travel agent 's puce face might turn if he squeezed its neck " briefly . " Exhausted , he stopped to rest . Nearby an amphibian-like hermaphrodite from Antares IV seemed to be mating with itself to pass the time . And a little farther away three fellow humans had spread their clothes on the floor and were definitely doing it . For a moment he considered inquiring whether they 'd be interested in making it a foursome . But , right now , he felt too low to hold up his end of the partnership . Turning around , he squinted at the flight status display screen in the distance . It still said , " DELAYED . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of itself standing at the flight attendant 's post . Then he realized the smaller alien was the perky erstwhile human female he 'd spoken to earlier . The PGS promotional holo they 'd shown on the flight here proudly announced its flight attendants were now equipped with " chameleon capability . " Their biosynthetic " flesh " and inner support structures automatically molded themselves into the form of whatever species they were assisting . Admittedly , a clever method for placating irate passengers-presenting them with a reassuringly familiar and , theoretically , more trustworthy " helper . " Sighing , Kroosew resumed his endless lonely trek . Every seat , no matter what size or shape , was occupied . As he trudged along it felt like a great weight was strapped to his back . With every leaden step he took , he and his bags seemed to get heavier and heavier . Then he realized they were getting heavier . The terminal was designed to accommodate sentients from planets with many different ambient gravities . He 'd wandered onto one of the gravitational gradient pathways between weaker and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the way he came . After walking several hundred more meters he had his first glimmer of good luck . A reasonably humanoid alien rose on its three legs from a nearby seat . The Lactomagnyzian pulled its flowing chalk-colored robe down from around its waist , and trotted contentedly away . Rushing to claim the vacated place before something else did , Kroosew stopped himself from collapsing onto it just in time . The seat cushion was covered by a mound of dark odiferous pellets . But as he watched the pile of alien souvenirs sagged and diminished , seemingly disappearing into the cushion . Then he remembered that promotional holo also praising the pristine sanitary conditions in PGS facilities . Busy , indefatigable nanoscrubbers incorporated into the very structural materials keep our floor and seating so hygienic you could even eat off them . Or , depending on your species " digestive system , even eat them yourself . Kroosew gingerly settled into the now-sparkling seat , reveling in the excruciating pleasure of simply resting his legs . But he nearly jumped out of his hard-won resting place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated on his right resembled a shaggy teddy bear . Its two soulful eyes looked timorously into his , as if asking for a hug . Except the alien was a bit more than snuggle-sized-over three meters tau , and about half that wide . The six largest fangs hanging down from its upper jaw were longer and thicker than Kroosew 's leg . Its claws resembled machetes , and clicked together like someone preparing to carve a turkey . For a long time the megacarnivore scrutinized him from a culinary point of view Then , apparently deciding he was too inconsequential a morsel , it lifted its nearly one thousand-kilogrAm mass from the reinforced seat and began stalking a meatier creature whose species Kroosew had never seen before . The obese grape-colored ungulate several rows away grazed placidly from a large bag of leaves , blissfully oblivious to its fate as the predator circled ever closer It 'd be terrible to see what happened to that poor purple bovinoid , Kroosew reflected-but much worse to be one . The sentient seated on his left seemed less dangerous . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body parts for slicing , biting , cutting , or chewing . A half dozen multijointed limbs radiated out from either side of a featureless pink globular body . A black derby hat was perched atop a large pale lump he assumed was its head . One of its two-fingered hands held a rolled up umbrella . The alien unfolded a limb that Kroosew took and shook reluctantly . It spoke in a basso profundo from a noselike bump rising from where its navel would 've been , if itd had a navel . " I say , old chap , are n't you a human being ? " " So I 'm told . " " Pimplonian , myself . My name is- " The creature gave a minute-long musically modulated toot that sounded and smelled like itd dined recently on refried beans , garlic , and onions . It quivered affably . " Splendid sentients , you Homo sapiens . Been studying for the last four standard years on your species " original planet of Earth . just received my Doctorate in Intersentient Philology at Oxford University , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in common . I 'm an omnivore too . " " Now that you mention it , we do almost look like twins . " " Indubitably ! " Apparently they did n't teach sarcasm at Oxford . It snorted , " Been waiting here long ? " A week ! " " Bit longer for me . When I arrived , I was n't in a family way . " It patted the derby-covered bulge Kroosew had mistaken for its head . " Deuced inconvenient . But when the old hormonal biorhythms surge , there 's no reasoning with them . Based on my observations , it 's a characteristic I believe we also share with humans . Fortunately , another member of my species was available and happy to assist . " Kroosew muttered politely , " Congratulations . When are you due ? " " Actually , old bean-right now . " The derby flew several meters upward as a geyser of puslike fluid exploded from the top of the creature . Kroosew wiped the viscous stinging goo from his eyes and saw a writhing monstrosity tearing its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Baby stared at him with three tiny eyestalks , its dozen mouths filled with needle-like teeth smacking hungrily . " I say , old chap , would you please pull my larva out the rest of the way ? Careful of the claws . There 's no known antidote for the venom on their tips . " Kroosew leaped up and grabbed his suitcases . The fetid fluid covering his clothes and hands was slippery , but he kept his grip on their handles . " Uh-sorry , but I 've got to check on my flight ! " The Pimplonian , still keeping a stiff fleshfold above its speaking orifice , turned to the octopoid traveler spread out on the seat to its left . " I say , old sport . Mind lending me a tentacle ? " Stumbling away , Kroosew peeked back over his shoulder The obliging octopoid lay on the floor , unmoving , as the newborn clutched in its remaining tentacles eagerly enjoyed its first meal . " Can I help you , sir ? " The flight attendant had changed back into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact his pants were still around his knees . Pulling them up awkwardly , he spluttered , " Yes , you can get me on my flight before anything else tries to eat me ! " " Oh , I hope you did n't forget my advice to avoid " Megacarnivores Only " restaurants ! " " No , I went to a restroom to clean up after a little " accident . " A toilet tried to bite me ! " The attendant smiled at him patiently . " The porcelain appliances we provide for human excretory functions are n't designed to do that , sir . " " Well , this one did ! I even made extra sure before I went in that the restroom was for male humans . I did n't recognize the word on the door , but the little outline figure looked right ! " " Was the figure blue , sir ? " " Well-no , it was red . " " That explains your unfortunate experience . You inadvertently entered a facility reserved for the unisex natives of Sytonurbukyt IV . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species " flabby texture in that area , their buttocks are hard and hornlike . Therefore , to maintain proper hygiene , their toilets contain trained bytuarse beasts . Their burrlike teeth are genetically engineered to scrape and abrade away any residual waste matter on the patrons after the toilet is used . " " Believe me , I 'll remember that next time ! " The flight attendant beamed happily at his wise resolution . " By the way , sit , I have good news for you ! " Kroosew felt as if the artificial gravity generator had been turned off . " Finally ! When will you begin boarding ? " " I 'm afraid the starship for Omegamons still has n't arrived yet . However , PAIN has located the luggage you checked in . It was inadvertently placed on an economy class sublight generation ship bound for Noivilbo 11 . When the ship reaches its destination in 213.8 terrestrial years , we 'll have them shipped back to you on the return flight . " His spirit broken , Kroosew pleaded , " Is there any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until my flight 's ready ? " " I 'm sorry , sir . PAIN informs me the average total biomass of sentients within all our waiting areas is approximately the same-1,319,564 kilograms , plus or minus 289 . " Kroosew sighed pessimistically . " Well , if I 'm lucky , I 'll find the one with the minus 289 kilograms . " " There 's another alternative , sit . PGS has recently instituted a new service for its customers . For a nominal fee , you can use a stasis chamber . " " A what ? " " An enclosure whose contents are kept in a state of virtually halted atomic activity . The occupant experiences what seems like a deep restful sleep . Relative to the universe at large , time will " stop " for it . " Kroosew frowned . " You mean like suspended animation . " " Stasis and suspended animation are , in their technical methodologies , quite different . However , the end results are approximately the same . This service would eminently meet your wish for solitude and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At this point , I 'm willing to try anything ! " She pointed to one of the interminably long corridors leading from the waiting area . " To reach the stasis chamber , go down Concourse No. 413 exactly 3.13 kilometers . Turn right at the " Krispy Krigleworms " food stand . Walk straight 2.13 kilometers till you reach the official Nineveh 6 souvenir shop , where we have a special today on upper garments suitable for humanoid species inprinted with the legend " My beezulgorb went to Nineveh 6 , and all I got was this lousy dilworf ! " Turn left and look for the orange sign saying " Stasis Chamber " in 113 standard Galactic languages . You ca n't miss it . " Fine ! " Kroosew took several steps in the direction the attendant indicated , then stopped . " You will let me know when my flight comes in , wo n't you ? AD I need now is to " oversleep " and miss it ! " " Have no fear , sit . I will personally ensure you reach your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not entirely reassured , Kroosew resolutely put his head down and began his long journey . He did n't hear the attendant call after him , " And please let me know what you think of this new service . You 'll be the first sentient to try our stasis chamber ! " When Kroosew finally reached his goal his limbs had lost all sensation . The orange sign on the wall spelling " Stasis Chamber " beckoned hypnotically to him . But its siren spell was rudely broken when he read the fine print beneath those words , telling how much the . nominal fee " to use it was . To pay for it he probably would have to embezzle from university research accounts . But , if it maintained his sanity , it was worth the risk . Even a nice quiet prison seemed appealing right now . He pressed his palm against a metal plate to authorize payment . Immediately a previously invisible narrow door swung open from the wall . There was just enough room for him to stand and squeeze his suitcases in with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow light . As he started reconsidering the wisdom of using it , the door dosed automatically . Suddenly claustrophobic , Kroosew looked in vain for a knob or button to open the door . Long-repressed memories of stories he 'd read as a child flooded back to him . The terrifyingly detailed accounts by that ancient Terran writer Poe about being buried alive-the victim clawing frantically and futilely at his coffin lid until finally suffocating in endless agony ! Then the light inside the chamber softened to a soothing azure . He felt his cares and worries fading away , his mind and body slipping into a deep restful steep ... " Time to wake up , sir " What ? it felt like he 'd closed his eyes just three minutes ago . The attendant was standing at the open door of the stasis chamber , looking fresh and vivacious . " Please follow me . " Kroosew hoisted his suitcases , praying this was n't another false alarm . As he followed his companion 's clicking echoing heels down the winding corridor he began to realize something was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milling throngs , no caterwauling babel of countless alien Languages . just the attendant and him , walking together like two lovers on a lonely beach . When they reached the silent waiting area he dropped his suitcases , convinced he was hallucinating . " Where is everybody ? " The attendant glanced at the vacant cavernous room . " They all left long ago . " " Well , it 's good to see some efficiency for a change . Although I ca n't say I 'm pleased my flight 's the last to arrive . Can I board it now ? " " I 'm afraid the starship you were to travel on never arrived here at Nineveh 6 , sir . It was hijacked en route by members of the Symbiotic Liberation Front , a group adamantly opposed to sentients travelling on starships . When they belatedly realized they were travelling on a starship , they directed the ship back to Omegamons III , intending to disembark immediately . She flashed him a gleaming smile . " Unfortunately , shortly after you left their system , the Omegamonians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg ritually offered to their sun , a.k.a. the " Great Scrambler of the Cosmos . " While the orthodox majority demanded it be broken at the traditional pointed end , a schismatic sect insisted the rounded end was more pleasing to their deity . " The Omegamonians decided to take their dispute to a Higher Authority . After studying your own textbook on stellar evolution and articles on imaginary matter , both groups directed their combined psychic energy toward the imaginary matter in their sun-dramatically increasing its density and transmuting its core to a critical amount of iron . Their world , your research team , and the starship were all vaporized with the rest of the system when Omegamons subsequently collapsed in on itself , and became a Type 11 supernova . " Kroosew fell onto an empty seat . All his colleagues , all their work-gone , de stroyed . His eyes drifted toward the ceiling , as if searching for the ghost of Omegamons among the other For a long time he stared upward , paralyzed with confusion and terror Finally he whispered , " Where are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out of this tragedy came the most important discovery in recorded history . like you , your esteemed fellow astrodynamicist , Dr. Hzabigolboob , was also visiting his/her home planet when that catastrophe occurred . Their subsequent research confirmed the role of imaginary matter in the " Omegamons Incident'and showed the path to the salvation of the universe . By the time the good doctor died some seventy-seven years later , showered with riches and worshipped as a demigod by half the Galaxy , the great project uniting all known sentients was well underway . " " Huh ? You make it sound like- " Cold sweat formed under Kroosew 's armpits . " How long have I been in that stasis chamber ? And why ca n't I see any stars up there ? " The attendant beamed , " For eons , countless intelligent beings focused their psychic energy on increasing the mass of all imaginary matter in the cosmos . When they finished , the total mass of real and imaginary matter in the universe was twice the value needed to halt its expansion . Our universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Since then innumerable civilizations have risen to glory , then crumbled to dust . The races that created them have long been extinct . But all those sentients died consoled by the knowledge that the present universe would ultimately collapse in the " Big Crunch ' - and a new one would be born , where intelligent life might evolve again . Kroosew leaped up and grabbed her shoulders . " How long have I been here ? " Then he noticed the badge on the perpetually self-repairing attendant 's uniform . The one showing the number of years she 'd been in service . It read " 113,459,238,485.28665 . " The last digit turned to " 6 . " " I 'm afraid it 's taken a bit longer to reach your destination than originally anticipated , sir Pan Galactic Spacelines declared bankruptcy for the 19e time several hours after you entered stasis . Unfortutely , PGSs creditors decided not to let it try reorganizing once again , or lend it more money . They deemed Nineveh 6 too costly to move or use , so it was simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above him , all its familiar stars long burned out , their planets cold and dead . The homogenous glow above him must be the cosmic background radiation from the " Big Bang , " made visible as it became hotter with the onrushing collapse of the universe-washing out the faint light of whatever dim stars still existed . Realizing the futility of it all , he let go of the unresisting attendant . " Why , " he whispered . " Why did n't you let me stay in stasis ? Why wake me up now to tell me I may be the last intelligent being left in the universe ? " " Indeed you are , sir . The universe has now contracted enough that all the accumulated knowledge and wisdom of every civilization that 's ever existed have come within range of PAIN 's scanners , and are now within its database . It informs me the last sapient being beside yourself expired 1,231,346,598 years agm . He moaned , " So now I get a ringside seat to watch the " Big Crunch ' - before I die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe will not achieve singularity for another 80,234,134 years . Well beyond your expected life span . " " Then I 'll starve to death instead ! " " Dear me , no . Uke the rest of this facility , the food synthesizers are self-maintaining , They continue to work as well as when you went into stasis . Would you like a complimentary bag of pretzels ? " The first shock was wearing off , and Kroosew was beginning to accept his fate . Although staying here for the rest of his life was hardly what he 'd planned on , there were compensations . There 'd be no more arguing with obtuse university committees , or waiting for starships that never came . The spaceport would provide him with food and shelter For the rest of his life he could study and contemplate all the mysteries of creation contained within its computer database . A simple , but fulfilling life . lAke that legendary story of a sailor on Earth 's oceans in ancient times , shipwrecked and washed up alone on a desert island , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , all but one need Suddenly long-repressed hormonal biorhythms surged within him . As a lateRomantic symphonic melody by a longdecomposed Russian swelled in his memory , he gazed at the redheaded attendant in a new way . Her perfumed rosy cheeks . The mouth that always smiled so invitingly . The seductive curves beneath her formfitting uniform . And if she was n't really a womanwell , nobody 's perfect . Shyly , tenderly , he took her hand in his . It was warm and soft . He even thought he felt a pulse-proof she had a heart , or equivalent circulatory pump , beating deep within her , only for him . It was as if she understood that he 'd been celibate for much longer than any man should be . " Is there anything I can do for you , sir ? " " Oh , you have no idea ! And please , do n't call me " sir " anymore . My name is Robinson . " " Alright-Robinson . She said it so beautifully-this gorgeous creature who 'd taken care of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he enfolded her in a passionate embrace , there was one final question he must ask her . " Why did you wake me now , instead of ages ago ? " " Because , Robinson , " she whispered , " I promised when you first came here that Id make sure you reached Omegamons . " Kroosew frowned . " I do n't understand . You said it became a supernova . " " Yes . But as the universe has contracted , the positions of its remaining constituents relative to Nineveh 6 have also changed . Objects once light years away from this spaceport have now moved much closer . " " I still don't- " " I 'm sorry PGS could n't fly you to Omegamons as originally scheduled . But now , your long wait is finally over . I removed you from stasis because you 'll soon be reaching your final destination . " " But there is no Omegamons anymore ! " " Oh , but there is , Robinson . just not in the form you remember . " Thirteen seconds later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design tolerances , and the spaceport and everything inside it were crushed and utterly destroyed . But just before the black hole created when Omegamons ; became a supernova wandered too close to the doomed facility , Kroosew heard the flight attendant say , " I could n't help you go to Omegamons . But , by waiting long enough , I made sure you got there the other way . " With a last sweet smile she said , " Omegamons has come to you ! "
