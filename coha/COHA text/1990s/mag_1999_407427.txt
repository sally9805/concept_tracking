The objects illustrated are in the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum in Bournemouth , England ; photograph by courtesy of the Bridgeman Art Library , London . // The town of Bournemouth , on the south coast of England , is nothing if not respectable . By contrast to Brighton , famous for its royal , theatrical , and criminal connections , Bourne- mouth is known as a health resort and place of retirement . Beautifully set beside the sea and surrounded by pine forests , it began to acquire a reputation for healthy air and exclusiveness in the mid-nineteenth century . Unlike Brighton , the town could not be reached by unsavory day-trippers from London . Instead , it offered some of the best churches and hotels in England , a symphony orchestra , and a thoroughly genteel sort of resident . The town 's early development is shown in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the construction of the Bournemouth pier , which was considered an indispensable feature of a seaside resort , with the white-painted Bath Hotel in the background . Today the city 's suburbs , with their handsome villas and gardens , remain a fine example of late Victorian urban planning for the prosperous . As Thomas Hardy put it in Tess of the d'Ubevilles , what he called Sandbourne was " a city of mansions , a Mediterranean lounging place on the English Channel . " 1 One of the creators of this prosperity was Sir Merton RussellCotes ( Fig. 1 ) , who , with his wife Annie ( Fig. 2 ) founded the house-museum in 1908 that now serves as Bournemouth 's civic museum and art gallery . Russell-Cotes was self-made in that his wealth came from his wife , whose family were cotton manufacturers . In 1876 , having traveled widely , the couple acquired the Bath Hotel , and four years later added the prefix " Royal " after a visit by a member of the royal family . They ran the hotel with considerable success , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the British and foreign royal families . As an advertisement described it in 1889 , the hotel was patronized by HRH The Prince of Wales , HM The King of the Belgians , HIM the Empress Eugenie , HRH the Duchess of Albany , the late Lord Beaconfield and other royal and distinguished personages.2 The many artistic guests included Oscar Wilde , who left in the guestbook the slightly ambiguous comment to the owners that you have built and fitted up with the greates beauty and elegance , a palace , and filled it with gems of art , for the use and benefit of the public at hotel prices.5 A particular favorite and friend of the Russell-Coteses was the great Shakespearean actor Sir Henry Irving ( 18381905 ) , to whom a room in the museum was dedicated . Such information is recorded in Sir Merton 's two-volume memoirs Home and Abroad , privately printed in 1921 . It is one of the finest monuments to vanity one could find , filled with records of the conversations ( usually of considerable tedium ) of his royal visitors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures all over England . // Russell-Cotes was not just a businessman . As a leading public figure he made a distinguished contribution to the growth of the developing town . Many of the citizens were extremely conservative , unwilling to allow the railway to come too close to the center of the town , hostile to the idea of a hospital , and resistant to opening up the approach to the sea by a new road along the shore . All these reforms , as well as the establishment of an orchestra and a public library system , were advocated by Russell-Cotes , who realized that there was money to be made from illness as well as culture . For a while he was extremely unpopular , having his effigy burned in the streets for his hospital plan . In the end , all his ideas were adopted , and their advocate became the mayor of Bournemouth in 1894 and was knighted in 1897 . Sir Merton was primarily notable , however , as a collector . Most unusually in Britain , he used his hotel as the setting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very rare comparable example . In France the Palace Hotel in Biarritz , furnished in the late nineteenth century , contained a collection of salon paintings comparable to that in the Royal Bath Hotel , while in the United States the Pfister Hotel in Milwaukee was embellished with nineteenth-century academic art . Nonetheless , the hotel-gallery remains a surprisingly rare type . Early photographs ( see Fig. 5 ) show the Russell-Coteses in rooms filled with contemporary paintings , assorted antiquities , ethnographical specimens ( as they would have been called ) , and ceramics , both European and Oriental . Visitors would have admired the ambitious House Beautiful nature of the interior decoration , much of which was commissioned for the hotel from the sculptor John Thomas ( 1813-1862 ) - who also worked for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert-and Thomas 's son Oliver . This survives only in part . A eulogy in the Plumber and Decorator of July 1889 conveys the perhaps overwhelming character of the hotel in its heyday : As I entered the hotel Mr Thomas was completing a sitting-room in scarlet and grey with peacock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having magnolia foliage trailed across the walls . The ceiling was treated in character with the walls with vine branches in neutral tints , trailing in natural graceful entwinings from the corners . The centre ornament is in tones of pink relieved with gold . The whole of the woodwork is painted in rich scarlet . Bedrooms adjoin this apartment which are furnished with tinted cornices in shades , and a deep chintz frieze surmounts a floral design of wallpaper . The Pompeian corridors which run through the entire ground floor are a striking feature of the hotel .... The garden corridor is treated in rich baronial style.4 In the public rooms of the hotel the Russell-Coteses showed many of the objects they had brought back from their foreign tours , devoting a drawing room to Japanese art ( Fig. 4 ) , which they particularly admired . However , the most prominent element of the collection was the paintings . Although it is easy to make fun of Sir Merton and his lordly airs , he was a passionate enthusiast for art . His taste lay in the mainstream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on contemporary British work , especially the academic type , and a tendency to avoid PreRaphaelite painting , which was considered indecorous and unhealthy by more conservative collectors . Sir Merton knew some of the artists he favored and loved to visit them in their studios to discuss their work . Among them was Edwin Long ( 1829-1891 ) , who was famous in his day for titillating ( and to our eyes , sometimes questionable ) depictions of half-naked female slaves . Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema ( 1836-1912 ) , a prominent royal academician , was something of a hero for Sir Merton , and his sumptuous house and studio on Grove End Road in London inspired the Russell-Coteses ' own residence , East Cliff Hall . In some instances Sir Merton influenced the character of a painting . John Liston Byam Shaw , one of the many artists influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites , exhibited a painting of a naked Jezebel at the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 1896 but was unable to sell it , probably because of objections to its voluptuousness . After some time a potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work on condition that Jezebel be appropriately clothed . The artist acquiesced , and the painting , with the figure in somewhat more decorous garb , is now in the RussellCotes Gallery ( Pl . XI ) . Although Sir Merton may here have been swayed by conventional prudery , he generally showed considerable enthusiasm for depictions of attractive women , which was one of the principal themes of his collection . // PI .

If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which Sir Merton had total faith , it guaranteed for him the reliability of his taste . Good examples of this genre include Henry William Banks Davis 's Approaching Thunderstorm , Flocks Driven Home , Picardy of about 1869 (   . VI ) , in which the painter conveys a sense of drama and includes strong biblical associations , and The Subsiding of the Nile by Sir Merton 's friend Frederick Goodall ( Pl . II ) . This was a type of painting that was inspiring and comprehensible and based on observation of nature . It was supported by John Ruskin ( 1819-1900 ) , whom Sir Merton fervently admired . In spite of an emphasis on British works , some foreign artists were included in the collection , especially those who had shown the sense to settle in Britain . From Charles Edward Perugini , an Italian who came to England in 1863 as a protege of Frederic , Lord Leighton ( 1830-1896 ) , Russell-Cotes bought the meticulously painted and subtly colored Capri Girl ( Pl . VII ) . Even when Victorian figurative painting went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained his commitment , buying when the market for such works was dropping steadily . In 1898 , as the collection grew , the Russell-Coteses began building East Cliff Hall ( see   . III ) next to the hotel , into which they moved three years later . They chose a fine site , highly visible from the central part of the town and overlooking the beach and Undercliff Drive , which Sir Merton had been instrumental in creating . The building was designed by a littleknown local architect named John Frederick Fogerty in a style categorized at the time as a mixture of Italian and French , but more recently dismissed as " thoroughly debased. " 5 Russell-Cotes had visited a number of the magnificent artists ' houses erected in London in the late nineteenth century by such prominent figures as Alma-Tadema , Edwin Long , and Lord Leighton6 at a time when many artists were making large fortunes . He must have had such houses in mind-not so much in the design of the exterior , which has a cheerful seaside quality faintly reminiscent of the shingle style-but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a building for entertaining , for sumptuously dignified living , and for the display of works of art . It was intended , like the artists ' houses , to illustrate the wealth and taste of the owner . The interior of the house is dominated by a large central hall ( Fig. 6 ) that is top lit and rises the whole height of the building . There is a gallery at the second-floor level over which , in the manner of the time , grand draperies were loosely hung . The stained glass in the skylights , the vaguely art nouveau plasterwork , and the stenciled decoration on the walls introduced decorative themes repeated throughout the building . From the early days this hall was filled with a bizarre assortment of objects . These included a fine collection of Maori axes , cloaks , and armor ; the natural history specimens that particularly appealed to Annie RussellCotes ; sixteenth-century armor ; Chinese and English porcelain and assorted earthenwares ; Norwegian wood carvings ; laundry mangles ; illuminated testimonials to the Russell-Coteses in silver ; and marble busts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other worthies , including , of course , Sir Merton and Lady Russell-Cotes . Any remaining wall space was filled with pictures . The splendor of this decoration , already out of date by the time it was being executed , much like the choice of pictures , extended throughout the house . The three principal rooms on the ground floor are the dining room , drawing room , and morning room . The rooms upstairs , while no less artistic in aspiration , are on a smaller scale . All rooms are richly decorated with stenciling , stained glass , and tiles , and the ceilings are by the Thomases . Japanese decorative motifs , as produced by British firms , continued the taste of a generation earlier . The masculine apartments , such as the dining room , were decorated in a dark rich style , as opposed to the more feminine rooms , such as the drawing room . The furniture tended to be of the English neoclassical variety , which was regaining popularity with English collectors , but the use of strong materials and the horror vacui @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aesthetic style of decoration that was gaining popularity in advanced circles . Nonetheless , contemporaries seem to have been admiring . Sir Merton quotes Lord Ribblesdale , a major collector and a trustee of the museum , as calling the museum in 1914 " a miniature ' Wallace ' Collection , and much more varied in its exhibits . " 7 Such a comparison with the national museum set up in London in 1900 to house the collections of Sir Richard Wallace and the marquesses of Hertford must have been highly gratifying to the Russell-Coteses . While East Cliff Hall might be considered a characteristic example of the artistically inclined residence of the very late nineteenth century , its strongly museum-oriented character was always unusual . From the beginning the RussellCoteses intended the house to be a museum under the influence of Ruskin who believed strongly in making art available to a broad popular audience . As early as the 1880s they had sent large sections of their collection on tour to regional galleries throughout Britain at a time when many of the new municipal galleries had hardly any collections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ norm for the Russell-Coteses . Three picture galleries were added to East Cliff Hall beginning in 1916 despite the difficulties in obtaining building materials during the war . They were opened in 1919 by Princess Beatrice ( 1857-1944 ) , whose every remark is recorded by Sir Merton in his memoirs . These sumptuous , top-lit galleries , decorated with improving slogans composed by Sir Merton for the benefit of the public , remain fine examples of beaux arts gallery architecture . The house was officially presented to the town in 1908 , but the family continued to live in it until the death of Sir Merton in 1922 , a year after the demise of his wife . During the Russell-Coteses ' lifetime members of the public could obtain tickets in advance for admission on Wednesday afternoons . After their death , the whole building was open to the public on a regular basis . Since the 1920s the museum 's fortunes have been mixed . On the one hand the collections continued to expand and remarkable works were acquired . These included Dante Gabriel Rossetti 's Venus Verticordia ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goddess of love filled with specific sexual imagery . It was bought by the museum with unusual perspicacity in 1946 , a time when Victorian painting was most unfashionable in Britain . In 1971 , at a time when Victorian painting was regaining popularity , a strikingly hallucinatory painting of the Annunciation by the reclusive visionary artist Simeon Solomon was given to the museum (   . XIV ) . An equally apposite acquisition was a little watercolor by Anna Alma-Tadema of an artistic house in Holland Park , London (   . IV ) , showing Rossetti 's red and black chalk study for Mariana , which is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City . Less happily , in the early part of this century , when Victorian art and architecture were generally despised , many attempts were made to dilute the Victorian character of the building and collection with the aim of transforming it into a standard civic museum . // Recent developments have been more fortunate . In the last decade most of the original decoration has been restored , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original character of this artistic house . It is the type of house that seldom survives in Britain with its furnishings largely intact . Leighton House and Linley Sambourne House in Kensington , London , are rare comparable survivors , but neither was originally intended by its owner as a museum . During the past decade it was decided that while modern art has a place at the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery and Museum , that place is beside , rather than within , Sir Merton 's palace of art . Exhibitions and acquisitions of recent art are held in a new wing beside East Cliff Hall , and an innovative program of commissioning work from contemporary craftsmen has been introduced by Simon Olding , the director . The last stages of restoration of the house and garden are currently underway , and the museum will reopen in the year 2000 as one of the most personal and distinctive Victorian house-museums in Britain .
