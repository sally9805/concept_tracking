A newlywed at the age of 71 , some 44 years after his first marriage was annulled , an admirer of high tech who nonetheless drafts speeches in longhand , a Republican who gets along better with the Clinton Administration than he ever did with its G.O.P. predecessors , Alan Greenspan has long been a man of surprises . But none is more startling than his recent transformation in the public mind . Back in 1994 , when he was engineering a series of interest-rate increases , the Federal Reserve chairman was regularly assailed as a zealot willing to strangle economic growth in pursuit of a chimerical goal of zero inflation . Today those jeers have melted to mild sarcasm . ALL HAIL SAINT ALAN , read buttons distributed by Bert Ely , an economic consultant who contends Greenspan is getting undeserved credit for the happy state of the U.S. economy . But to admirers , Greenspan is a monetary wizard . Says economist Allen Sinai : " The Greenspan Fed is the all-time champion in American history . " <P> So what has Greenspan done to earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the past 23 months , the Fed has made only one change in interest rates : a quarter-point increase last March . But standing pat in this case is a positive accomplishment . Greenspan has resisted pressure from nervous Nellies inside and outside the Fed to slam a monetary brake on the economy . The nation 's foremost inflation hawk now seems to accept the idea that unlike in the past , deep changes in the economy have made sustained growth possible without pushing prices up . <P> To be sure , Greenspan would never say that  --  or anything else so explicit . He once quipped that on taking over the Fed in 1987 , he learned " to mumble with great incoherence . " Nor does he buy the wildest new-economy talk . He dismisses as " less than credible " any idea that " we need no longer be concerned about the risk that inflation can rise again . " Greenspan is on guard , a renowned numbers cruncher who keeps tabs on the most obscure corners of the economy . Robin Leigh-Pemberton , former governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferences Greenspan was likely to back up his predictions by citing such obscure data as vacuum-cleaner sales in Iowa . <P> Greenspan can also claim credit for knowing when to declare victory and go home . It is unclear whether he ever seriously thought inflation could be brought down to zero . But he seems to realize that the present rate of about 2% is close enough to fulfill his stated ambition to keep price increases so small that they do not drive business decisions  --  that nobody feels impelled to buy or build before the price goes up . <P> Ever cautious , Greenspan warned in October that labor markets were tightening at an " unsustainable " pace . And he has never recanted his belief that the Fed should tighten credit mildly at the first signs of renewed inflation . But for now the Asian crisis has put on the shelf any plans for an interest-rate boost . Maybe the good times can roll a little longer . <P>  --  By George J. Church .
