<p> Who says the Cold War has ended ? At the Army 's showcase training center for armored warfare here , they fight it every day . <p> Soldiers assigned to Fort Irwin 's training brigade still undergo rigorous schooling in the fighting doctrine of the vanished Warsaw Pact . They still charge around the desert in imitation Soviet T-72 tanks and BMPs , Soviet armored personnel carriers , painted with red stars . They even wear Soviet-style insignia . <p> " We try to be pure to the soul of what this document says , " said Col. Patrick O'Neal , the brigade commander , displaying a thick manual on Soviet fighting doctrine . " We think we 've done a pretty good job of internalizing it . " <p> Army officials said collapse of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact has not diminished the value of Fort Irwin 's National Training Center , to which Army units come from around the country for regular , two-week rotations to fight mock battles with the " Krasnovians , " as soldiers based here are known . The opposing forces clash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely mimics the stress and confusion of real warfare , and they " kill " each other with harmless laser beams instead of shells and bullets . <p> As evidence of the training 's value , Army officials cite the stellar performance of U.S. armored divisions in the Persian Gulf War and note that , although the former Soviet Union has disappeared , Soviet equipment and methods continue to pervade the armies of former Soviet clients worldwide . So strong is their conviction that they are seeking to expand the 1,000-square- mile training center by 250,000 acres , arousing the ire of environmentalists and their congressional allies . <p> " We 're a growth industry , " O'Neal said . <p> But disappearance of the Soviet Union as a plausible foe inevitably has caused Army officials to reevaluate the mission of the training center , created in 1981 primarily in response to the threat of a Soviet-led land invasion of Western Europe . In that respect , Fort Irwin is a microcosm of the entire U.S. military , whose planners are struggling to define and justify their missions in a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for different reasons , " said O'Neal , a genial , balding southerner who earned a Bronze Star for valor in Vietnam and likes to ride around the battlefield with a cigar between his teeth . " Back in ' 83 , if you had come here and asked them , ' Why do you have the National Training Center ? ' they would have pointed East , " he said . <p> The most obvious adjustment occurred after Iraq 's 1990 invasion of Kuwait , when the Army retooled the Fort Irwin brigade  --  also known as OPFOR , for " opposing force "  --  into the " Samarans , " an Iraqi-style fighting force with a preference for trench warfare . Also in the OPFOR 's repertoire are the " Atlanticans , " a Cuban-style infantry force , and the still-developing " Hamchuks , " loosely modeled on North Koreans . <p> O'Neal recently ordered his analysts to review the military doctrine of 10 nations , including Libya , Iran and Algeria , to determine the degree of Soviet influence there . He said the results " could grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Soviet tactics . <p> But O'Neal insisted that precipitous changes are premature , saying , " We can not be an army of the day , " and that the main goal is to teach generic combat skills that will benefit U.S. soldiers in any theater of war . To that end , he said , OPFOR tries to subject troops coming here for training to a bout with " the world 's best sparring partner "  --  a well-trained , Soviet-style mechanized regiment . <p> " The big point is you need something that stands in stark contrast to your own , " O'Neal said . " You need an enemy . " <p> Congress generally has accepted that argument , even as lawmakers lay the groundwork for sharp reductions in other areas of Defense Department spending . In a study completed last month , the General Accounting Office , Congress 's investigative arm , approvingly concluded : " Although the Army will continue to train combat forces to meet a Soviet threat , it also trains forces to meet other threats , and the Army can adjust its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The chief concern remains a Soviet-style army . Such is the level of attention to realistic training that the Army maintains a depot here full of captured Soviet equipment , much of it recently plucked from the battlefield in Iraq with only a few hundred kilometers on the odometers . <p> Army technicians study the equipment to learn about its capabilities and apply their knowledge to the training center 's armored force  --  old Sheridan tanks modified with fiberglass panels to look like T-72s or BMPs , some equipped with dummy versions of Soviet Sagger missiles . <p> " My purpose here is to train the soldiers on the capabilities and limitations of the enemy equipment , " said Capt . Edward Chesky , who runs the facility . " Everyone says the Soviets have disintegrated , and that 's great . The problem is everybody and his brother bought the Soviet equipment . . . . That stuff will last 20 to 30 years . " <p> For much the same reasons , soldiers assigned to O'Neal 's 177th Armored Brigade , the OPFOR 's real-life designation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactics . They learn , for example , that unlike American tank crews , Soviet tankers prefer to fight from behind hills , emerging only to fire . They learn of the Soviet emphasis on destruction of equipment and enemy soldiers rather than taking enemy ground . And they learn of the Soviet preference for " mass , " ground invasions employing overwhelming numbers of tanks and armored vehicles  --  a reflection of Soviet numerical superiority during the height of the Cold War . <p> Army tacticians said the doctrine , which implies that troops and vehicles are expendable , is reflected in the crudeness of Soviet equipment , which they describe as so difficult to maintain that changing a tank engine takes 100 hours , compared with 20 minutes for an American M-1 . <p> The training center 's concern for verisimilitude was on display one recent morning when OPFOR mounted an attack on " Blue Force "  --  elements of the 4th Infantry Division ( Mechanized ) of Fort Carson , Colo.  --  in an operation code-named Hammer and Sickle . <p> The operation began deep in the desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanders gathered amid parked armored vehicles for an intelligence briefing . Using a map illuminated with red flashlights , briefers sketched what appeared to be a fairly clear picture of the American force , arrayed miles away in a broad valley called Central Corridor . <p> OPFOR had gleaned its knowledge during the night by electronically pinpointing origins of enemy radio transmissions and collecting reports from small , forward reconnaissance patrols , a doctrinally pure undertaking reflecting the fact that the Soviets " have a lot of military intelligence assets , " Capt . Annette Redmond said . <p> One thing lacking in the old Soviet Union , however , was sophisticated , American-style night-vision equipment . Thus , the OPFOR did not move against the enemy until after sunrise , tearing across the desert at 40 mph in two separate columns of tanks . Soon puffs of smoke from simulated artillery bursts rose from the desert floor , and the tanks swerved in unison to the right , their treads kicking up rooster tails of dirt . <p> O'Neal , weaving amid the tank column in his jeep-like " Humvee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very controlled formations , " he said . <p> Suddenly , Blue Force F-16s shrieked in for an air strike , dropping flares to confuse guidance systems of would-be ground-to-air missiles and scoring several electronic kills . The tense , urgent voices of OPFOR commanders rallying their troops  --  " Let 's start pushing it out , you guys are getting too damn timid on me ! "  --  crackled over the radio in O'Neal 's vehicle . <p> But the attacking force , which had a 3-to-1 advantage over the defending soldiers , pressed on . Successfully breaching a Blue Force minefield , simulated with blue plastic canisters and monitored by observers who electronically " killed " tanks straying from the path opened by mine-clearing bulldozers , the OPFOR quickly gained the upper hand . <p> Soon the battlefield was littered with motionless M-1 tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles , their flashing yellow lights attesting to the prowess of the Krasnovian marksmen and a wholly typical OPFOR victory .
