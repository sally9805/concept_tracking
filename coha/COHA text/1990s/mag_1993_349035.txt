Citibank has been taking full-page ads for what it calls its Stock Index Insured Account . " With this unique account , " runs the ad , " your IRA or Keogh deposit actually earns two times the average percentage increase in the Standard &; Poor 's 500 Index over a five year term . Yet it 's 100% safe . " <P> Double the S &P; with no risk ? <P> " I 've only been in this business 25 years , " confessed the president of a large brokerage firm , " but I ca n't for the life of me figure out how Citi can be offering people double the S &P."; <P> Of course , there 's a catch . No way could Citibank actually offer you double the stock-market return with no risk , though its ad and brochure make every attempt to convey that impression . But it 's entirely legal , fiendishly clever ( in a friendly , relatively harmless sort of way ) and just one of the many things to be wary of as we desperately reach for alternatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money-market fund . <P> Close reading of the Citibank ad tells the tale . But if my friend the Wall Street mogul did n't get it , how many widows and orphans will ? <P> First , it turns out , you get none of the dividends the S &P; 500 stocks pay over those five years ; Citi keeps them . From 1961 to 1992 , the S &P; 500 has grown at 10.2% a year  --  but only 6% a year if you exclude dividends . Second , Citi does n't double the five-year gain in the S &P,; if there is one . It looks at the average of the S &P; over those five years , compares that average with the S &P; when you started , and doubles that gain . Well , if a tree grows to be 5 ft. tall in five years , it 's grown 5 ft.  --  but its average height over those five years was only 2 1/2 ft . So doubling it ai n't such great shakes after all . <P> But it 's worse than that , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Many of you are too young to believe this , but it 's true . ) What makes this deal work so well for Citi is that the downs reduce the average of the ups . Say the S &P,; which is today near its all-time high , drops 25% over the next year , then just bounces around aimlessly until the fifth year , when it explodes , gaining back that 25% loss plus an additional , mouth- watering 50% . ( These things happen too . ) Had someone just bought the S &P; 500 and held it for five years  --  someone like Citibank  --  he 'd have got that mouth-watering 50% appreciation plus five years ' dividends . Not bad . But had someone rolled his IRA over into Citi 's Stock Index Insured Account , he would have got . . . zero . ( In calculating the average , the first 48 bad months would have more than canceled out the final 12 great months . ) His principal would be safe , but it would n't have earned a dime . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its ad . <P> The most obvious risk to Citi is that , five years from now , the S &P; will be lower than it is today , and Citi will have to make up the difference . But because the market 's natural bias is up , what with growth and inflation , it rarely falls over any five-year stretch . <P> The less obvious risk is that the S &P; might zoom 75% right off the bat , say , and then just sit there for five years . That would be an " average " 75% gain , which Citi would have to double . Wow . But , my friends , the chances of the market zooming 75% anytime soon are . . . Well , forget about it . In any event , Citi can hedge against these risks .
