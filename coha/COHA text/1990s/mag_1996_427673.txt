Section : MONEY &; INVESTMENTS/THE MONEY MEN Wall Street looks pretty tame compared with Savvinskaya Embankment in Moscow . <p> BORIS JORDAN always had a hankering for things Russian . The grandson of Russian migrs , he grew up on Long Island , studied U.S.-Russian relations at New York University , and later , looking for a job in Russia , asked for work with CS First Boston in Moscow . In 1992 , then just 26 , he got his wish . In early 1994 , at the dawn of Russia 's privatization program , Jordan persuaded his employer to buy some $400 million in privatization vouchers , which most Westerners regarded as worthless scraps of paper . <p> Good move . Jordan exchanged the vouchers for equity stakes in some of Russia 's largest companies , making huge profits for those CS First Boston clients who decided to come on board . CS First Boston also made out spectacularly . It dominated Russia 's fledgling securities market that first year , racking up an estimated $100 million in profits from its Russian operations , almost half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russian stock market boom turned to bust , but Jordan had made a name for himself . At 29 he quit CS First Boston , taking 30 of his colleagues , and established a full-service , Moscow-based investment bank : Renaissance Capital Group . Jordan and his fellow bankers own over half of the new bank . The remaining stake is owned by dealster Michael Dingman , now a taxpatriate in the Bahamas ( FORBES , Nov. 18 ) , and by Unexim Bank , one of Russia 's homegrown merchant banks . Renaissance claims to have $500 million in assets and $50 million in equity . <p> Renaissance 's specialty is direct investment , via buyout funds ( Sputnik I , II and III ) whose subscribers are said to include institutional investors like Harvard Management and George Soros ' Quantum Fund . The idea is to buy controlling stakes in Russian industrial companies , restructure them and then sell out three to five years later to Western corporations looking for a foothold in Russia . <p> These are , shall we say , very special situations . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , past-due payments to suppliers and wage arrears . It is likely to be desperately short of working capital , since barter trade accounts for up to 80% of sales . It has a terrible accounting system , terrible marketing and productivity way below international standards . <p> All this spells opportunity to Renaissance . " If we see that a company is making the right products and that we can make a difference , we go in , " says Gregory Bedrosian , a 30-year-old Harvard M.B.A . and CS First Boston alumnus who is general partner of Sputnik along with Jordan . " We do n't pretend to be experts in industrial production , but we do know how to deal with the Russia-specific problems . <p> " Most of the companies we look at have already been visited by someone from a Western corporation , who typically reports back to the home office that if the Russian company solved a few fundamental problems , it could be interesting . We fix these seemingly insurmountable problems and then bring in the Western strategic partner . " <p> A year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 57% of the Segezha Paper Co . They canned the board of directors and 15 top managers , overhauled the account books and in June sold half of their stake to the Swedish paper company AssiDoman . Jordan wo n't say what profit they made . <p> It 's not always so easy . There are few rules here and they are easily broken . Russia 's corporate insiders often simply refuse to register transfers of stock , and competitors can get rough to the point of murder . Renaissance has not yet suffered either of those indignities , but it confronts unusual obstacles . <p> Here 's one for the books : In league with some other investors , the three Sputnik Funds bought 44% of Novolipetsk Metals Co. , which runs a 7-million-tons-a-year steel mill 250 miles south of Moscow . Sputnik 's restructuring plans were opposed by the mill 's general director and reportedly by a rival shareholder faction led by the London-based Trans-World Metals . When we say " opposed " we do n't just mean with arguments . When Boris Jordan left Russia in May , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected . The Novolipetsk boss had used his personal contacts with a high member of the government to block the visa . Jordan had to cool his heels for seven weeks before getting back in . The general director of Novolipetsk , meanwhile , is still occupying the corner office . <p> There are several institutional funds dedicated to direct investment in the former Soviet Union , including the $155 million Russia Partners Fund and the $300 million AIG-Brunswick Millennium Fund . These are backed by the Overseas Private Investment Corp. , which insures against expropriation and civil war , among other things . Jordan 's Sputnik avoids OPIC . Says Jordan : " It is due diligence that determines success here , not guarantees . " To say nothing of the fact that OPIC guarantees entail all sorts of environmental impact and U.S. impact criteria , which slow down decision-making . <p> Due diligence is not what it is in the U.S. It is a lot tougher . To visit a paper company near the Arctic Circle , Bedrosian had to travel there mid-winter via converted military helicopter . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had neither running water nor heat . " We slept in our hats and overcoats and the next morning we went off to see the company management , " he says . <p> Bedrosian tells the story of visiting the Volga Paper Co. when he was scouring Russia for investments for CS First Boston 's Ice Breaker Fund . As Bedrosian was visiting the paper mill , he noticed huge , dust-covered crates packed away in the corner of the factory . They contained $100 million worth of brand-new Austrian-made equipment . The Russians had n't bothered unpacking the stuff . The fund together with other investors bought a 90% stake in Volga Paper for a fraction of the value of the new equipment . <p> For enduring all this discomfort and taking huge risks , Renaissance and its competitors expect a nice reward and they demand it . The going rate for funds like Sputnik is an annual 2% of the capital invested , plus up to 20% of profits . Renaissance is currently trying to raise $300 million for its fourth Sputnik Fund ( minimum investment , $5 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire . Renaissance Capital 's trading desk has handled $5 billion in debt and $400 million in equities since the beginning of the year . As an investment banker , Renaissance engineered the private placement of $10 million in equity for a Russian-American joint venture that sells bottled water under the brand Saint Springs . <p> In November Renaissance and Donaldson , Lufkin &; Jenrette comanaged the stock offering for Vimpel-Communications , Russia 's largest cellular company and the first Russian company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange . Jordan , meanwhile , is trying to set up a Russian insurance company to get more assets for Renaissance to play with . <p> Still game for a flier ? If you do n't have $5 million to put into a privately offered fund , your choices are somewhat limited ( see box ) . <p> This year Russian equities are hot , with the Ros index up 100% in dollar terms since January . Says Jordan : " If Yeltsin dies or remains incapacitated , the market will stagnate . If he returns to the Kremlin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But make no mistakes : This market is unpredictable . Jordan was a bull two years ago , just before the Russian market suffered a 75% correction . The market recovered . But it was a long , scary ride . <p> GRAPH : Zoom ! Ros index . Russian stocks give a new name to volatility . Note : The Ros ( short for the Russian word for Russia ) is an index of 30 stocks in Russia .

Due diligence for this Sputnik general partner entails midwinter helicopter trips close to the Arctic Circle . <p> By Paul Klebnikov and Caroline Waxler <p> BUYING INTO RUSSIA <p> IN ITS FIRST few years the Russian stock market was limited to hedge funds and people with well-placed friends in Moscow . Now small fry can get in . <p> The easiest way : buy shares of the Templeton Russia Fund , a closed-end trading on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 72% in the past 12 months ) , but it 's no bargain . It has a somewhat high annual expense ratio of 2% and , at a recent 24 1/4 , is priced at an 11% premium to the value of its portfolio . <p> Another option : buy Russian shares that trade over here as American Depositary Receipts ( or American Depositary Shares ) . There 's one listed on the Big Board so far , cellular service provider VimpelCom . At a recent 31 , VimpelCom is up 50% from its November offering price . <p> Several ADRs trade over-the-counter . Examples : Lukoil ( 43 3/8 ) and Chernogorneft ( 12 1/4 , oil and gas exploration ) . ADRs are expected soon for Rostelecom ( telephone service ) , Irkutskenergo ( Siberian electricity ) and Surgutneftegaz ( oil and gas production ) . <p> Some ADRs , such as those for Gazprom , Russia 's largest energy company , are available only to institutions . That does not mean you should beat down doors to get in . Gazprom 's ADR is trading at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are held by Russians . <p> And then there 's the local market , if you want a stock that does n't have an ADR . Some Moscow brokerage firms are willing to take accounts from Americans with as little as $10,000 to invest . These outfits will insist you hold your shares in street name . Bear in mind that there is no Securities Investor Protection Corp . over there . If the shares are lost in an embezzlement or bankruptcy , good luck . <p> Can you get CS First Boston to open an account in Moscow for you ? Not unless you are a very , very big investor . A Merrill Lynch or a Smith Barney can buy anyone some of the ADRs . <p> One open-end fund has been available to U.S. citizens since July , the Lexington Troika Dialog Russia Fund . Expense ratio , 2.3% ; minimum , $5,000 . <p>
