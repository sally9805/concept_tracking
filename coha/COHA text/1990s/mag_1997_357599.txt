Competitors of Toys " R " Us have been slapping the retail giant silly in recent years . Last week the Federal Trade Commission took a whack , ruling that Toys " R " Us had illegally forced such manufacturers as Mattel and Hasbro to withhold their products from warehouse clubs like Costco . The FTC barred Toys " R " Us from blacklisting toymakers for selling to low-price clubs . The company says it will appeal . <P> The ruling surprised some in the industry . Although the Toys " R " Us tactics may sound like bullying , retailers do this sort of thing all the time in an effort to get exclusive merchandise or to protect themselves from price wars . Toys " R " Us was already under severe pressure from discounters such as Wal-Mart when the warehouse clubs , led by Costco , started to move in on toys . The Toys " R " Us share of the $30.2 billion industry has fallen from 25.4% in 1990 to 20.5% , while Wal-Mart 's has grown from 9.5% to 15% . <P> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its suppliers : toys sold to the discount clubs would not be sold at its stores . Exhibit A : Barbie , a hot seller that Toys " R " Us did not want available elsewhere at next to nothing . Manufacturers do n't like the clubs either , because they stock a limited number of items at very low margins . Toys " R " Us , on the other hand , might stock everything Mattel makes . Admits Costco CEO James Sinegal : " You could fill Madison Square Garden with the people who do n't want to sell to us . " Industry watchers say the FTC may be sending a message to other retailers whose market power exceeds their market share . " It 's a warning shot across the bow , " says Isaac Lagnado , president of Tactical Retail Solutions , Inc . <P>  --  Reported by Valerie Marchant/New York
