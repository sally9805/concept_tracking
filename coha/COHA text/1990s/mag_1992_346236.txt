ALL THAT WAS MISSING WAS NORman Rockwell to immortalize the scene for an old Saturday Evening Post cover . The sea of white faces in the crowd at the Texas state Capitol in Austin last week was **35;376;TOOLONG America : elderly retirees , earnest young men and women in ROSS FOR BOSS T shirts , and a sprinkling of former Vietnam POWS in black shirts as a reminder of their suffering . As the patriotic pageantry built to a climax , a compact man with jug ears , weather-beaten face and glasses , the sort of fellow who looks like he might belong behind the counter in a small-town hardware store , bounded up to the impromptu stage , and the crowd roared , " Run , Ross , run ! " <P> Not bad for the kickoff rally of an up-from-nowhere independent presidential campaign . Not bad for an almost candidate who says he deplores the hokum and hoopla of professional politics . Not bad for a reluctant dragon whose supporters had just filed petitions containing more than 200,000 signatures  --  about four times what he needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , delivered in his trademark East Texas twang , was more sound bite than substance : " If I could wish for one thing for my children , it 's to leave the American Dream intact , so they can dream great dreams and have those dreams come true . " But the message was unmistakable : look out Washington  --  look out George Bush and Bill Clinton  --  here comes the first revolution ever led by a billionaire . <P> Ross Perot , the plutocrat populist poised for the presidency , holds court from the 17th floor of a North Dallas office tower  --  a memorabilia-filled aerie ( the artistic motif is Rockwell paintings and Frederic Remington sculptures , and Perot is happy to tell with a chuckle what he paid for almost everything ) that radiates almost preternatural calm . His desk is clean , save for the week 's schedule of media interviews and a list of Perot coordinators in all 50 states . But at a time when Bush and Clinton are racing around the country , giving speeches , honing positions , posing against scenic backdrops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billionaire Boy Scout , " suddenly leads the polls . A TIME/CNN survey last week by Yankelovich Clancy Shulman underlines Perot 's surprising appeal : he wins a three-way race for the White House with 33% to Bush 's 28% , with Clinton trailing at 24% . Perot has done the impossible : crafted a credible national campaign out of two dozen TV interviews and half a dozen speeches . <P> It 's hard to remember that three months ago , Perot was just another TV talk- show guest , a blustery businessman who was supposed to chat with Larry King about the economy before a CNN special on breast implants . Asked at the outset whether he planned to run for President , Perot gave a typically forthright answer : " No . " But 45 minutes later , Perot  --  by all evidence impulsively  --  dropped the biggest bombshell of the 1992 campaign . Yes , he 'd run , and run hard , if his supporters would put him on the ballot in all 50 states as an independent . That " if " has been all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen since yellow ribbons dangled from every lamppost during the gulf war . ( Perot , despite his superpatriot image , strongly opposed that war . ) In an interview with TIME last week , Perot made it clear that the official declaration of his candidacy is a mere formality awaiting the proper dramatic moment .
