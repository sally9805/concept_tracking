Saddam never got a chance to use his SUPERGUN , a powerful megacannon capable of hurling chemical , biological or nuclear warheads hundreds of miles . U.N . forces dismantled two models in Iraq last year , one an incomplete version with a barrel 165 yards long . But Western intelligence agents in the Middle East are nervously tracking another design that is much easier to build . Unlike earlier models , the new weapon uses ordinary 1/8-in. bridge wire , a steel fiber common in the construction of suspension bridges . Spun while red-hot around large-diameter steel pipe , the wire strengthens the barrel enough to withstand the pressures of firing long-distance shells . Syria , Libya and other potential users would have no trouble manufacturing such guns .
