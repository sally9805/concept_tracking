McDonald 's serves jillions of Happy Meals each year , but not many are being shared around the company 's pleasant headquarters in a Chicago suburb these days . " There 's no question we 've been under more stress than we 're used to , " says McDonald 's USA chairman Jack Greenberg , who runs the company 's 12,100 domestic restaurants . <P> Top management is unhappy because sales in U.S. stores have been flat as a frozen beef patty in the past two years and profit margins are eroding . Some of the 2,750 franchisees are unhappy  --  some downright testy  --  because rapid store expansion has cannibalized sales and the company 's advertising and promotion , although ubiquitous , have been ineffectual . Most recent case : a deep-discount program called Campaign 55 ( the company was founded in 1955 ) , which has n't been a rousing success . <P> And the customers ? Funny thing : the customers are still reasonably happy  --  22 million of them show up every day  --  and they 'll gladly take a bargain where they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers are , increasingly , just as happy to go elsewhere for their junk-food fix : to Burger King for arguably better burgers , to Wendy 's for better variety , to Starbucks and Einstein Bros. for better coffee and bagels in the morning , and to Boston Market or any number of gussied-up supermarkets for dinner . Says Greenberg : " I really believe our restaurants are running better today than we were six years ago ; but I think our competition is also running a lot better today than they were six years ago . " <P> McDonald 's is still the king of convenience  --  nobody runs a better fast-food operation than Mickey D  --  but it has become vulnerable , outflanked on such factors as price and taste . It 's having a hard time playing ketchup . Campaign 55 was designed to address pricing , and last year 's Arch Deluxe introduction the food issue ; neither has gone according to plan . <P> Take prices . For the past 18 months , the company has been raising some prices selectively , and consumers have begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company statistic that tracks performance in existing stores , turned negative for six consecutive quarters through the third quarter of 1996 , an unheard-of reversal for a company that lives on growth . Greenberg had to improve McDonald 's value equation fast . " The question is , What do you do about that ? Lower prices a couple of cents on everything , or go on TV and talk about 55cent meals ? " He called the media department and got out the price ax . <P> Campaign 55 , which started in April , has a seemingly simple premise : Customers can buy a Big Mac or other designated sandwich for 55cents if they also buy any size beverage and fries . " My Size " meal is the tag line . Patrons , the theory goes , love the cheap burgers . Owners pocket profits on the soda and fries . The plan proved less than simple , particularly when details appeared in the Wall Street Journal before franchisees approved it . Fears of an all-out industry price war sent the stock spinning , and some franchisees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost . " From a sales point of view , it 's not what a lot of operators expected , " explains J.M. Owens , who operates eight stores in the Atlanta suburbs . Owens voted against the plan , but he believes that over the long haul , its value message will work .
