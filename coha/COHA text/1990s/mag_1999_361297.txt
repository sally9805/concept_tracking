The people who brought you last week 's blitzkrieg of antismoking billboards may have an unlikely forebear : ADOLF HITLER . In his forthcoming The Nazi War on Cancer ( Princeton University Press ) , Penn State history professor ROBERT N. PROCTOR suggests that Nazi researchers were the first to recognize the connection between cancer and cigarettes . The prevailing view was that British and American scientists established the lung-cancer link during the early 1950s . In fact , says Proctor , " the Nazis conducted world-class studies in this field . " But their findings , because of the abhorrent medical practices used by the regime , were ignored . Hitler , a teetotaling vegetarian , believed healthy living advanced the master race ; Jews , Gypsies and smokers soiled the purity of the nation . The Fuhrer even boasted that his kicking the habit in 1919 helped bring about the " salvation of the German people . " Hence the Allies saw the Third Reich 's campaign against smoking as the product of fascism , not science . " It is still taboo to say anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier work exposed the unspeakable acts of doctor-torturers like Josef Mengele . Meanwhile , the Nazis themselves continued to supply tobacco to their troops . <P>  --  By David Spitz/New York
