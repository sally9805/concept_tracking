It is math time for the fifth-graders at Fernangeles Elementary School in Sun Valley , Calif. , and everyone is stumped . The students have spent close to an hour puzzling over the question at hand : " What if everybody here had to shake hands with everyone else ? How many handshakes would that take ? " While the children , seated in small groups , debate and frown and scribble notes  --  and devise alternatives to the dread act of actually touching classmates of the opposite sex  --  their teacher , Kathy Pullman , roams the room . When the hour ends , no group has an answer . " This happens to be a particularly difficult lesson , " Pullman says , unfazed . The class will dive in again after lunch . <P> To peer into Pullman 's classroom is to glimpse why math has once again become a battleground in America 's education wars . This school year , nearly half of all American elementary students are expected to learn math the way children do at Fernangeles Elementary : not in neat rows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but through trial-and-error problem solving , often in groups with little direct instruction and almost always with a calculator nearby . Advocates call it " interactive " or " inventive " math and insist that it sets American schoolchildren on the way to becoming " mathematically powerful . " <P> When opponents of these currents are being polite , they call that kind of talk nonsense . And they have labels of their own . One is " whole math , " a pejorative reference to " whole language , " the controversial method of reading that emphasizes learning entire words and phrases over mastering phonics . Another is " new-new math , " recalling the ill-fated New Math fad of the 1960s and ' 70s , which introduced millions of students to math arcana like set theory and congruences . ( Remember those ? Did n't think so . ) <P> Resistance has resulted in pitched battles at school-board hearings and within academia over the future of U.S. math education . Educational scholar E.D. Hirsch Jr . says opposition to the newest math is " suddenly making people wake up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't comport with reliable theories , and we 're making a mistake . " <P> It all started in 1989 , when the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics , in response to the consistently poor math scores of U.S. children , issued new standards overhauling math education . Out went the stalwarts of traditional math : the rote memorization drills , the droning chalkboard lectures . In came the cool stuff : calculators and geoboards , hands-on , open-ended problems , exercises that encourage kids to discover their own route to the right answer . " The standards emphasized that you had to pay attention to how kids think , " says Gail Burrill , president of the council . <P> Eight years later , 40 states have instituted some " standards-based " math programs in their schools , and the National Science Foundation spends $10 million a year on development of comprehensive instructional materials . California has become a leader : one cutting-edge curriculum called MathLand is used , its publishers claim , in 60% of the state 's K-6 classrooms  --  including those in Fernangeles , where MathLand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has its own Website : 192.216.191.114/ . " These kids will be better problem solvers , " says Pullman . " They will think more . "
