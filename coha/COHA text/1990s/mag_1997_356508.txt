If the 1995 stroke that paralyzed Jean-Dominique Bauby was cruelly premature , at least death had the courtesy to wait until the 45-year-old French journalist finished his last assignment . Less than 72 hours after readers and critics alike hailed as a triumph his memoir of living with locked-in syndrome  --  a state of virtually total paralysis that leaves the victim , in Bauby 's words , " like a mind in a jar "  --  the former editor in chief of French Elle magazine died . Bauby 's book Le Scaphandre et le Papillon ( The Bubble and the Butterfly ) is a celebration of life written by a man incapable of speech or movement . <P> A career journalist whose wit , flair and savoir vivre became personal trademarks , Bauby saw his fast-paced life come to an abrupt end on Dec. 8 , 1995 , with the stroke that left him paralyzed . Though Bauby was dependent on hospital staff and machinery for all his bodily functions , his brain remained unscathed . He soon discovered that the only muscle still under his control was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bauby let his nurses know that his mind was alive and well inside its immobile frame . They responded by reciting a special alphabet to him with the understanding that Bauby would blink at letters he wanted written down . Repeating the process resulted in words , sentences and entire discussions . <P> In June 1996 , Bauby blinked out a letter to some 60 friends and associates to reassure them that his state was not vegetative . Editors at French publisher Robert Laffont , who had worked with Bauby before his stroke , were so impressed that they proposed he use the method to write a book about his condition . Bauby accepted and , composing and editing his prose before dawn , dictated entire sections of the book from memory , letter by letter , to Laffont employee Claude Mendibil . <P> The result is a remarkable 137-page account of the tedium , trials and travails  --  and sometimes even joys  --  of the locked-in life . Bemoaning his fruitless " physical rehabilitation " sessions , for example , Bauby writes , " I would be the happiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saliva that permanently invades my mouth . " He lets his readers know that his celebrated wit survived the stroke by pointing up the ironic aspects of his condition . Bauby recalls a contract he signed before his illness to write an updated version of the Alexandre Dumas classic The Count of Monte Cristo  --  a tale involving a paralyzed protagonist who communicates by blinking . " The gods of literature and neurology decided otherwise , " Bauby laments , adding a twist . " To reverse the decrees of fate , I now have in mind a story whose main character is a runner instead of a paralytic . Who knows ? It might work . "
