Second of two articles Cognitive science faces a philosophical challenge <p> John R. Searle sees gaping cracks in the edifice of the mind constructed by cognitive scientists . Searle , a philosopher at the University of California , Berkeley , peruses the mental rules and representations and computer programs that buttress the cognitive citadel with the eye of a skeptical contractor . Watch out for falling bricks , he warns ; the structure lacks the mortar of consciousness to hold it together . <p> " More than anything else , it is the neglect of consciousness that accounts for so much barrenness and sterility in psychology the philosophy of mind , and cognitive science , " Searle asserts . <p> Although Searle 's remark will win him no popularity contests among scientists of the mind , it nevertheless reflects the recently renewed interest in deciphering the nature of consciousness . From a variety of perspectives , scientists are now trying to define more clearly what they mean when they refer to " conscious " and " unconscious " mental activity <p> Searle first rankled cognitive scientists in 1980 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument , an attack on the notion , promoted by advocates of " strong artificial intelligence , " that the mind corresponds to a computer program implemented in the hardware of the brain . <p> Searle compared the computers favored by artificial intelligence enthusiasts to a person who does not speak Chinese but sits in a room with Chinese dictionaries and a filing system . If an outsider slips questions written in Chinese under the door , the person uses the reference works to compose answers in Chinese . Responses emerging from the room might prove indistinguishable from those of a native Chinese speaker , Searle contended , even though the person toiling in the Chinese Room understands neither the questions nor the answers . <p> The moral of this exercise : A system such as a computer can successfully employ a set of logical rules without knowing the meaning of any of the symbols it manipulates using those rules . <p> Supporters of strong artificial intelligence view the Chinese Room as a flimsy sanctuary from the argument that a properly programmed computer possesses a " mind . " Philosopher Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls Searle 's analogy simplistic and irrelevant . A computer program that could hold its own in a conversation would ' contain layers of complex knowledge about the world , its own responses , likely responses of a questioner , and much more , Dennett contends . Indeed , computers have displayed a growing conversational prowess in the last several years . Their increasingly deft dialogue stems from the interactions among various strands of information , each of which comprehends nothing on its own , Dennett maintains . <p> Put another way , proper programming transforms a bunch of unreflective parts into a thinking system , whether they reside in a mainframe or a human skull . <p> <p> For Searle , the Chinese Room debate lies behind him as he aims his new assault on what he calls the ' much deeper " mistake of cognitive scientists their neglect of conscious experience . He describes his views in the December 1990 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES ( with sometimes heated responses from more than 30 cognitive scientists ) and in his book The Rediscovery of the Mind ( 1992 , MIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind as a collection of relatively independent faculties , or modules , that contain unconscious rules for language , perception , and other domains of thought , Searle argues . Consciousness , in the sense that one can pay attention to , reason about , or describe these rules , rarely gets attention in their theories . Other facets of the unconscious , such as memories and repressed conflicts , sometimes enter awareness but more often influence thought and behavior in surreptitious ways , according to cognitive researchers . <p> Searle spurns this approach , with its reliance on what he calls a " deep unconscious " unable to pierce the surface of awareness . Mental life consists of conscious states and those neurophysiological processes that , under the right circumstances , generate conscious states , he argues . Most brain states that participate in mental life do not reach consciousness , but they must have the capacity to do so , Searle proposes . He dubs this formulation the " Connection Principle . " <p> For example , the unconscious intention to satiate hunger with food simply reflects some biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce conscious appetite and foodseeking behavior in certain situations , Searle asserts . Unconscious processes totally divorced from awareness , such as the transfer of chemical messengers from one brain cell to another , harbor no intentions and do not meet Searle 's criteria for " mental . " <p> Mental life emerges as an inherent feature of the brain , just as liquidity is a feature of water , in Searle 's view . <p> Moreover , consciousness feeds off an individual 's singular point of view , thus rendering it subjective and not reducible to traditional objective measurements of behavior , he maintains . Investigators of consciousness must strive to understand " the first-person point of view , " Searle says . <p> His model treats consciousness as an on-off switch - one is either conscious or not . But once the switch goes on , the brain produces consciousness in a broad range of intensities . Even dreams are a mild form of consciousness , Searle asserts , though they fall far short of fullblown alertness . <p> The center of conscious attention contrasts with " peripheral consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on writing an article , a person retains peripheral awareness of the shirt on his or her skin , the feel of computer keys , and numerous other thoughts and sensations . <p> Searle treats the unconscious mental conflicts and desires described by Sigmund Freud as cases of " repressed consciousness , " because they typically bubble to the surface , although often in disguised form . Most beliefs , worries , and memories also operate outside awareness , with the potential for entering consciousness , and thus follow the Connection Principle , he notes . <p> But the unconscious does not consist of fully formed thoughts , Searle asserts . The brain contains " brute " biological processes that create the wide variety of conscious experiences , he says ; in essence , the brain builds consciousness on the spot , rather than hauling it out of storage . <p> <p> Cognitive researchers make a mistake comparable to that of scientists more than a century ago who erroneously believed that the leaves of a plant turn toward the sun because the plant wants to survive , he maintains . Biologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements of a plant 's leaves , not a floral " decision " to catch as many rays as possible . <p> In the same way , the brain 's neurophysiology produces certain types of conscious experience without making any inferences or following any rules , according to Searle . <p> Consider a visual phenomenon known as the Ponzo illusion . When two parallel , horizontal lines of equal length lie between two vertical lines that converge toward the top , the parallel line on top looks longer . Cognitive psychologists who specialize in perception suggest that the brain computes sensory information using unconscious rules that sometimes produce optical distortions . One theory holds that the Ponzo illusion may result from two unconscious inferences : first , that the top parallel line lies farther away because it 's closer to the converging lines , and second , that the top line extends farther because it 's farther away . <p> Searle offers an alternative theory : Still-unclear brain processes handle parallel and converging lines in such away as to produce the conscious experience of the Ponzo illusion . " Nonconscious operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or size and distance judgments , " he argues . <p> Searle also attacks the notion of unconscious rules of " universal grammar " championed by linguists such as Noam Chomsky of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge . Chomsky and others have theorized that the ability of healthy children to learn readily the language of their community and other natural human languages - but not logically possible " artificial " languages shows that the brain contains an innate ' language-acquisition device " consisting largely of grammatical rules that are unavailable to conscious thought . <p> Searle , an ardent foe of universal grammar for more than 15 years , agrees that human brains contain a biological capacity for language acquisition that limits the type of languages we can learn . But proposing language rules that lie beyond the grasp of consciousness makes as little sense as proposing a universal visual grammar that tells us , " If it is infrared , do n't see it , but if it 's blue , it 's okay to see it , " Searle holds . The brains visual system simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Berkeley philosopher says it often proves tempting to theorize about thought processes unavailable to consciousness , especially when studying complex abilities such as language learning . But " brute neurophysiology , " not hidden rules , translates perceptions and language into thought and behavior , Searle contends . <p> Connectionist computers , also known as neural networks , work on this principle , he notes . Some connectionist models convert meaningful input into meaningful output by mathematically altering the sensitivity of connections between processing units rather than by manipulating rules or symbols . Neural networks may still fail as models of the mind , but they avoid the quicksand of " deep unconscious rules " that sucks down cognitive science , Searle says . <p> <p> Searle 's critique wins little favor with some cognitive scientists . His demand for conscious accessibility to all unconscious mental states ' is arbitrary and pointless , " contends MIT 's Chomsky <p> One current version of universal grammar theory , proposed by Chomsky and his colleagues , describes specific types of mental rules and representations handled automatically by a computational system in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extract meaning from certain expressions ( such as " John is easy to catch " ) but find the wording of other expressions confusing or somehow wrong ( as with " John is easy to be caught " ) , according to Chomsky <p> Searle 's abandonment of unconscious rules for language understanding in favor of unknown neurophysiological properties presents a prescription for scientific confusion , Chomsky asserts . <p> Moreover , Searle 's contention that unconscious mental states possess intentions or goals appears erroneous , holds psychologist Maria Czyzewska of Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos . Psychological researchers currently assume that the unconscious contains information that lies mainly outside conscious control but that shapes thoughts and behavior , despite lacking a preset agenda , she points out . <p> For example , multiple-choice or recall tests containing words on a previously studied list evoke conscious memories . However , volunteers often unintentionally use the same words on tests that do not ask for those words , such as lists of word fragments that can be completed in a number of ways ( SN : 11/17/90 , p.312 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' or unconscious . <p> Implicit responses do not spring from unconscious intentions , nor do they suggest a distinction only between consciousness and neurophysiological states that produce consciousness , Czyzewska contends . <p> Another critique comes from physiologists Walter J. Freeman and Christine A. Skarda , both of the University of California , Berkeley . Neurophysiological processes do not cause mental states , conscious or otherwise , as Searle proposes ; they are mental states , Freeman and Skarda argue . <p> Background electrical activity in the brain reflects a chaotic process , in the mathematical sense , they theorize ( SN : 1/23/88 , p.58 ) . The brain uses this flexible energy state to organize massive numbers of brain cells instantaneously in response to sensory information , the scientists contend . They have reported that chaotic electrical activity appears in both the olfactory and visual cortex of rabbits . <p> Self-organized , unpredictable electrical activity throughout the brain incorporates past experiences and creates an unconscious " space of possibilities " for handling further experiences , Skarda maintains . As the brain takes in new stimuli , various patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and memories , she contends , rather than emerging from an unconscious storage bin , as in digital computer models of memory and learning . <p> " Brains are less like libraries than like nurseries and farms , " Freeman notes . <p> Even if Freeman proves right , cognitive scientists have yet to develop a green thumb for cultivating true insight into the mind , Searle responds . They invoke a bevy of invisible rules and computer programs in the brain that only stoke intellectual chaos , he holds . <p> No simple scientific remedies will cure what ails cognitive science , Searle remarks , but researchers must remember that " the brain is the only thing in our skulls , and the brain causes consciousness . " <p> ILLUSTRATION : The Ponzo illusion , in which the upper of two equal and parallel lines looks slightly longer . <p> By BRUCE BOWER <p> CORNERING THE UNCONSCIOUS <p> Suppose you want to find out what an acquaintance really thinks about you . Your best bet might be to ask one of your friends and one of your enemies to query @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you can estimate the acquaintance 's true attitude by comparing the rosy comments delivered to your friend - undoubtedly boosted by social pressure - with the positive comments expressed to your enemy , which likely underestimate actual friendly feelings . <p> This strategy guides a new approach to teasing out conscious from unconscious influences on memory and perception , described in the June AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST by psychologist Larry L. Jacoby of McMaster University in Hamilton , Ontario , and his coworkers . " It 's an important advance : ' remarks psychologist John E Kihlstrom of the University of Arizona in Tucson . <p> Kihlstrom and other researchers typically chart unconscious influences by contrasting explicit and implicit forms of memory and perception . Explicit tests tap conscious knowledge , as when volunteers try to identify previously studied words on a multiple-choice test ; implicit tests reveal unconscious influences of memories or perceptions , as when volunteers unwittingly complete ambiguous word fragments with previously studied words . <p> But many investigators acknowledge that conscious recollections or perceptions at least partly boost scores on implicit tests . <p> " Just as gaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good times , a measure of unconscious influences requires separate conditions in which unconscious processes oppose and act in concert with the aims of conscious intention , " Jacoby says . <p> The Canadian psychologist devised such a measure to confirm a prior study in which volunteers who were distracted while reading a list of concocted names later rated many of them as famous when shown a new list containing the same names , new nonfamous names , and famous names . Unconscious familiarity with previously read names apparently produced " false fame " judgments , Jacoby theorizes . In the new experiment , he first gave participants a conscious opportunity to reject the influence of unconscious familiarity by telling them that the earlier read names were not famous . This " opposition test " corresponds to a known enemy questioning an acquaintance , Jacoby says . <p> Experimenters then told the volunteers that another list of previously read names came from " obscure " famous people , thus putting conscious recollection and unconscious familiarity " in concert " - similar to an acquaintance being questioned by a known friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recollections for names , Jacoby subtracted the probability of making " false fame " judgments on the opposition test from that on the in-concert test . With this measure , he calculated the contribution to false fame responses made by unconscious familiarity <p> The results : Dealing with distractions while reading names radically reduced conscious recollection , but false fame judgments soared . Undisturbed study of the names reversed this pattern . <p> Manipulations of attention apparently open the door to particularly strong unconscious influences , Jacoby asserts . For example , background music accompanied by audible lyrics pitching a commercial product probably leaves people open . to far more unconscious persuasion than a " subliminal " sales message hidden in the same music , he contends . <p> By B.
