Good-bye , raise . Hello , bonus . A compensation revolution is gripping corporate America . Companies all across the country  --  including 30% in one recent survey  --  are considering scrapping annual raises and instead offering bonuses that are based on your performance and company profits . Your company could very well be next . Consider this : The average annual raise in 1995 is expected to be a measly 4% , the lowest in two decades and roughly a mere half of one percentage point above inflation . At the same time , more corporations are dangling cash rewards down the ladder . This year , according to benefits consulting firm Towers Perrin , bonuses will be awarded at 30% of the companies it surveyed , up from 25% in 1994 . And according to a survey of 2,253 companies last year by the Wyatt Co. , a Washington , D.C.-based human-resources consulting firm , 42% of companies plan to install performance-based alternative reward pay programs within two years . The upside of bonuses , which range from 2% to 30% of annual pay , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for doing good work . The downside , of course , is that your base pay , on which benefits including profit sharing , pensions and life insurance are calculated , remains the same . And even when your boss likes you , you must re-earn your bonus year after year . " Companies now want to reward their employees based on the measurable value they add to the company , " says Jay Schuster , co-author of The New Pay , a 1992 book on incentive-pay schemes . To prosper in this new compensation environment , it 's wise to master the fine points of your firm 's compensation policies and to boost your visibility and skills . " It 's no longer okay for ... people to just do their jobs from 9 to 5 , " says Edward L. Gubman of Hewitt Associates in the January/February issue of the professional journal Compensation Benefits Review . Today you must continually demonstrate that you 're highly motivated , tuned in and contributing mightily to the bottom line . Here are your best strategies to get more pay : * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary ranks within your division , company and industry . In other words , are you being paid like a star or a schlump ? To learn the pay standard for your position , read the want ads in the local newspaper or in established trade journals . Regional bureaus of the U.S. Labor Department also provide listings on average pay for most professions in your region . Then , armed with this information , talk to your company 's compensation manager in the human-resources department . Ask about pay philosophy . " Some companies make it a practice to pay market rate , while others pay a percentage below and then make up the difference with bonuses or other perks , " explains Steven Gross , a v.p. at the Hay Group in Philadelphia . * Think like a CEO . If your company is getting clobbered by market forces , this may not be the time to demand a sizable increase . On the other hand , if profits are soaring , you might be able to get a share of the riches . Also , stay abreast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer into a new division or volunteer for a short-term project that showcases your particular talents . Or if cost cutting is the name of this year 's game , suggest procedures that would make your department more efficient . And , yes , if you hear the company president is giving a speech , get hold of a copy and read it . You 'll be able to glean some writing on the company 's upcoming walls . The employee newsletter and annual reports may also offer you potentially good leads you can act on . * Suck up to the boss . The juggernaut of layoffs  --  about 1.1 million over the past two years with no letup in sight  --  has just about buried the notion of job security . Indeed , an alarming one-third of Americans in a recent MONEY poll ( see the particulars at left ) said they were afraid to ask for more pay because of the " current job climate . " But staying mum wo n't keep you safe . Rather , make an appointment at least once a year to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company . Confides a New York City investment banker at Smith Barney whose total annual increase comes from her bonus : " It 's not enough just to get a deal done here . You have to make sure everyone knows you got the deal done . " At the end of every year , a month before the bonus pie is carved up , she sends a one-page memo to her boss listing each deal she negotiated during the year , including how profitably it turned out . Then she maneuvers to hold at least one informal conversation , say , on a business trip or over lunch , with a member of the bonus committee . " I know this sounds conniving , " she concedes . " But that 's what it takes . Bonuses are performance , plus politicking . " * Ask for more . " Only a decade ago , it was seen as bad taste to talk about money with your boss , " says Cathe Johnson , a director of organizational development and training at Motorola . " Today , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to get paid more ? ' " Here 's how to do it : 1 . If you are underpaid and can demonstrate your value to the company , ask straight out for the increase that brings your base pay up to a level that 's at least standard for your firm . Managers at large companies usually have less latitude about compensation than those at small firms . Nevertheless , in either case , make a direct request . 2 . Do n't give up if you 're told that raises are capped or averaged this year . You can appeal to the big boss . But Joseph Kilmartin , a senior compensation consultant at the Wyatt Co. , warns : " Go over your boss ' head only if you 've got a job lined up . " A better alternative may be trying to tap into the bonus pool . Ask your supervisor about how your bonus is calculated and what it would take to earn a higher one . You may prefer to set specific goals with your boss that you periodically update . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the marketing director at Blessing White , a development consulting firm in Princeton , N.J. , watched his annual raise sink from 10% four years ago to just 3% in ' 94 . Each year he had been eligible for a 20% bonus but was still not coming close to netting the top amount . So Walsh scheduled quarterly meetings with his boss to establish priorities , and then backed these up with informal meetings twice a month . " By being more involved , " says Walsh , " I 've boosted my bonus from 12% two years ago to about 16% last year . It 's much easier for me to show my boss what I 've contributed because we are in constant contact . " 3 . If your company lacks a bonus plan or you 've ever been considered eligible or one , start acting as if you deserve one . After all , the more you do , the better your boss looks . Just remember to get your supervisor 's approval before you begin revamping the database or putting in an extra five hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " make the mistake of embarking on a project they think will earn them more without first consulting their supervisor . If they do n't get the reward they expected , they end up discouraged . " Most bosses will go to great lengths to keep a valuable employee satisfied . " It 's expensive to replace good workers , " says Kilmartin . " Consider the downtime and the cost to advertise or hire a headhunter . And the loss of one key employee can hurt morale in general . " * Leverage your skills . So you 've garnered a spectacular 20% increase and you feel like resting on your laurels for a fiscal or two . Do n't . Take advantage of every training opportunity that attracts you . For instance : Is there an extracurricular class on cruising the Internet ? Sit in . A special task force on quality ? Volunteer . Look beyond the firm for training as well . Approximately 72% of full-time employees are eligible for their companies ' job-related tuition assistance , yet only 7% take advantage of that valuable perk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , with many companies now poised to enter the global marketplace , think about a foreign language course . There 's yet one more pot you can stir in this new bonus stew , especially if you feel stuck in a current slot : Consider a move to the side . " Many companies now encourage lateral moves as a way to increase your skill base , " explains Sherman Oaks , Calif. career consultant Beverly Kaye . You may not immediately see bigger numbers on your pay stub , but you can gain experience that may lead to a promotion . " Additional skills will translate into additional pay down the line , " says Barbara Collins , a senior vice president at Drake Beam Morin , the New York City-based outplacement firm . Finally , consider this clear-eyed advice from compensation insider Cathe Johnson : " It 's not the company 's job to take care of you anymore . It 's up to you to steer your own career . " PAY HER , HUG HIM Working women want more money , while men yearn for security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for higher salary over increased job security . That 's one of the surprising findings of our recent exclusive telephone poll of 637 workers , conducted by ICR Survey Research ( margin of error : plus or minus 3.9% ) . The female focus on pay is entirely logical . They make 28% less , on average , than men . Only two out of five women , compared with half of all men , think they are paid what they 're worth . Other specifics : * Happiness hits at $50K . Nearly 56% of workers with household incomes of $50,000 or more are satisfied with their pay , as opposed to 42% of those with incomes of $40,000 a year or less . <p>
