HE CAN ARGUE HIS CASE for another box of Smarties like a lawyer , but he has trouble sharing his Lego . He has a Santa 's workshop full of toys that would dazzle all the other kids on the block ... but they wo n't play with him . He has well - off , fast - track parents who buy him designer dungarees and play computer chess with him after work to make up for not providing him with a sibling . But he 's sad , he 's a misfit and at the end of the day , he winds up playing alone with his yo - yo and his fantasy friend called Oswald . That 's the stereotype of the only child and his parents . Like many stereotypes , it 's mostly myth . " The myths are that only children are spoiled , self - centred , lonely and socially inept , " says Pam Miller , who started a group , which ran from 1989 - 92 , called One &; Only for one child parents . " But the research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these traits than children with siblings . People are looking for certain things in the only child based on the myths and they find them when they want to . " However , the myths may have had some validity in past generations , says Miller , who lives in Vancouver , British Columbia and is the parent of an only child herself . Only children used to be rare , so they felt different . " Anything negative about them was attributed to their onliness , " she says , " and so these myths took hold and were exaggerated . " Also , in the days of higher rates of stillbirth , miscarriage and infant death , people often ended up with only one child not by choice , but by circumstance . Parents might understandably have doted on and indulged the one and only precious child that survived . With far fewer children in child care and no preschools , only children might not have come into contact with playmates their own age until they entered the public school system  --  which was n't until grade one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , some had all the social graces of a grizzly bear emerging from hibernation . But times have changed and the only child is no longer an oddity . In fact , 39 percent of Canadian families with children at home are single - child households  --  that 's 44 percent more than 20 years ago , says Miller . The numbers have increased , she says , for several reasons : more marriages break up now , dual career couples may not have the energy to handle more than one child , and more women are waiting until they 're 35 or 40 before they start their families  --  and may then find they ca n't have a second child even if they want to . Only children have changed along with the circumstances that produce them . With more mothers out at work , the child is not the sole focus of all the parents ' spare time and energy , and most children today have joined the scrum of kids at child care or preschool by age three . So the only child is less spoiled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . Yet the stereotype remains the same , and people will still murmur " better none than one " and accuse one - child parents of being selfish and materialistic ( keeping their standard of living high by limiting their childraising expenses ) . In fact , " There may be more social pressure to have two children than to become a parent in the first place , " say Denise Polit - O'Hara and Judith Berman in their book Just the Right Size : A Guide to Family Size - Planning . Anthea and David Poskitt of Vancouver have one daughter , Nicola , age five . " People used to ask , " When are you having another ? " and , " Think of poor Nicola when she 's older , ' ' " says Anthea , a teacher . A client who finds out I have only one child will sometimes say , " Just one ? Planning another ? ' ' " adds David , who is an architect . " It 's almost an expected element that you have two children . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Becky Striegler , who lives in White horse , Yukon , with her three - year - old son , Neal . " At the child care , the lady will say , " Neal is really interested in little babies . I think he wants a little baby brother or sister . ' I have had one friend say , " You do n't want him to be an only child , do you ? ' ' " Research has shown that people feel that childless couples are selfish but they 're not hurting anyone with their selfishness except themselves , " says Miller . " People feel that couples with only one child are also selfish but that their selfishness hurts the child , which recent research shows to be totally incorrect . " In fact , even the popular profile of one - child parents as the career couple who have only one child out of choice may be something of a myth . When Miller surveyed the membership of One &; Only , she found that , despite the enviable lifestyle of the one - child parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sibling squabbles , greater mobility  --  only about one - third of those surveyed had actually chosen to have just one child . Recent research by Lillian G. Katz , professor of early childhood education at the University of Illinois , shows that only children are as well adjusted as kids with brothers and sisters . In fact , only children may even have advantages over children with siblings . Figure not transcribed Only children tend to be more confident , co - operative , and mature , " says Miller . Because the parent - child relationship is less likely to be influenced by the child 's sex , and chores are n't as likely to be sex - differentiated , she explains , " Only children are also less likely to be sexually stereotyped than children with siblings . " Only children tend to be at ease with themselves , have high self - esteem and less need to control others , according to Dr. Ronald W. Richardson in his book Family Ties That Bind . Some of the stereotypes are just negatively worded versions of what are really positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - esteem can be called conceit . My own son has natural leadership abilities which are often interpreted as bossiness . " Research , says Miller , has found that in a competitive game , only children are more likely to make co - operative moves than competitive moves , because they have n't had to compete against siblings . But they tend to compete with themselves , so they 're very self - motivated . While onlies have no at - home experience fighting with other children , they have another skill that children with siblings may not have , Susan Newman points out in her book Parenting an Only Child . Onlies learn early on to try out their ideas with their parents and consequently usually have excellent verbal skills . With more exposure to adult reasoning and information , they often have high rates of achievement and high scores on intelligence tests . Only children receive , on average , 20 percent more years of education than children with siblings , according to Judith Blake , a demographer at the University of California at Los Angeles ; 85 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children ( US News and World Report , 1989 ) , and of the first 23 US astronauts , 21 were only or oldest children . They are highly represented among scholars and leaders , says Miller . Onlies have a natural tendency to want to be in charge and often become entrepreneurs or business owners . Famous only children include John Updike , Alice Walker , Indira Gandhi , Frank Sinatra , Susan Isaac and John Cleese . All that one - on - one attention from both parents has its pay - offs , but there 's also a down side . " The only child does have more potential for more adult attention , nurturing and stimulation , " says Rick Beaver , an educational psychologist in Kent , England . " This could be an advantage or a disadvantage , since the child might develop a greater dependence on adults for stimulation . " Anthea Poskitt admits that she and David do focus on Nicola . " She 's come to expect that as the norm , so when we ca n't , she demands it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conversation . It 's very difficult to speak to David when she 's around . " The three - way system does n't work that well , " adds David . " It becomes a three - way circus . " At Point Roberts , where the Poskitts have their holiday house , Nicola relates better to the adults in the local community than to the kids , says Anthea . " She 's the five - year - old who 'll sit on the teenagers ' blankets  --  ten teenagers sunbathing with radios and she 's right in the middle eating chips , as happy as can be ! " Anthea Poskitt agrees that Nicola has had a lot more time talking with adults than most children . " Over the years it adds up to a lot more than if you have a lot of children . I 'm sure that it 's really enriched her knowledge and her vocabulary  --  she 's quite far ahead . Although one thing that concerns me is that at her ( parent participation ) preschool she says her best friend is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've noticed on my duty days she 'll go straight to an adult and say , " Can you play with me ? " or " Can you read with me ? ' ' " Should Nicola 's mother worry ? Beaver comments that although only children are often more articulate and have better general knowledge through their greater contact with adults , " There 's actually quite a lot of social interaction that children learn better with their peers and so only children may be a couple of steps behind in learning age - appropriate social skills . " Only children tend to be quickly frustrated and more prone to overperfectionism  --  what they do is never quite good enough . " An only child who compares her skills and abilities with the adults around her instead of her peers will always see herself as inferior , if she does n't have the measure of her peer group to judge herself against , " says Beaver . One - child parents may need to look to their own perfectionism as the source of their child 's . High - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says Miller , and because they only have one , they might be over - anxious for them to succeed . These high expectations can be a source of stress for any child , says Beaver . " A lot of parents are very free and easy in that respect , but if you do n't happen to have parents like that , then it 's tougher if you 're an only child . Children with siblings share the expectations . There 's more pressure on the only child to perform . " That kind of pressure , he says , could be behind the findings of one American study published in 1991 which concluded that siblings are good for your health and that an only child is more likely to have high blood pressure , and to smoke and drink more heavily in adult life , than a child who has brothers and sisters . The researchers , from the State University of New York and the University of California , say the findings are hard to explain , but may be linked to the psychological and emotional support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect of having siblings , and the lonely future of the adult only child , may be the biggest concern for one - child parents . In fact , studies in the area of family planning suggest that parents have a first child to gain the psychological benefits of parenthood , but are motivated to have a second child primarily for the sake of the first child , according to Denise Polit - O'Hara and Judith Berman . I sometimes think about having a second one for Nicola 's sake , " says Anthea Poskitt , " mainly because of the time I 'm spending with my own four siblings now . There 's something about family that 's different from friends . I feel that as an only child she may miss not having siblings later on , as an adult . " David Poskitt , on the other hand , has no qualms about this . He has two sisters and a brother but , he says , is close to none of them . Some studies of how divorce affects children have claimed that only children are hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one study that shows only children adapt better to parental divorce than kids with siblings , because they tend to be more mature and independent . How hard children are hit by separation and divorce depends more on how careful the parents are , Beaver thinks , than whether or not there are brothers and sisters to share the trauma with . " If parents can break up and still remain amicable and talk to each other , then children are n't hit so hard , " he says . " But if it 's tough , then it 's probably tougher on an only child because there 's no one to share it with . " London journalist Alex Benady is going through a difficult separation himself , and feels that siblings might have helped his only daughter , aged two , by diffusing some of her mother 's hurt and anger . " As it is , Hannah takes the full brunt of it . She ca n't avoid it , " he says . Benady 's own parents divorced when he was an adolescent , but he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " We all reacted in different ways , " he says . " My twin sister ranted and raved . I just clammed up and withdrew . I kept the pain to myself . Although I talked about it to my friends , it was n't something I shared with my brothers and sisters . " I think people exaggerate the value of siblings , " says Miller . " I have five siblings and I get along with two of them , so what does that say ? That you have to have six kids in order to get two friends for your child ? And most of my siblings live thousands of miles away . So I think that aspect is glorified in some people 's minds . " Many one - child parents find extended family and friends can substitute for siblings . " Nicola has four girl cousins from age three to ten , " says Anthea Poskitt , " and they all live quite near . From those cousins comes a real sense of family . She feels they 're cousins and they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street  --  so that gives me some real comfort , knowing that she has that . They talk about how much they love each other and how they want to be together all the time . " On holidays , Neal needs a companion , " says Becky Striegler . " But we can always find a friend to take with us . He might even be more adept at making friends because he 's had to . It 's like travelling on your own  --  you get more out of it because you 're forced to make contact with others . " Miller agrees . " I think that only children are more creative about finding friends than kids with siblings we 've never been forced to do so , " she says . " They learn to build an extended family . " Another real concern among one child parents , says Anthea Poskitt , is that only children will have a harder time as their parents age " because they 'll be the only one to make decisions and carry the burden when their parents are older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child can be counteracted by careful thought and planning on the part of the parents . In fact , says Miller , it 's crucial that the parents of an only child really think about what they 're doing , and have a conscious and informed parentage style . They also need to be more careful about the messages they 're transmitting , says Beaver , because if there are no other regular influences around like grandparents , they 're the child 's sole source of messages about the child herself and about the world . It 's crucial that parents of only children stay well informed , " he deflect or dilute what the parents are trying to achieve , and no siblings to turn to who could give them other information from which to form an opinion .
