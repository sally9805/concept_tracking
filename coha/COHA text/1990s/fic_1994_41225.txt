The Bay of Dolphins ( no date ) <p> My dearest , my one and only . Between our embraces , a light year always passes . You know how much I distrust love letters , but still I must write to you . How could I prove to you my love , when you do n't see either my eyes or my skies ! <p> I prefer to describe to you the region and the people of the Bay of Dolphins . It is an unusual region , my love . If I were not tied to the ordinary and unhealthy passion of my attic , I would stay to live here  --  on the condition , of course , that you would want to live here too , that this region would please you . We could drink the light of the moon . But now is not the time to dream about that . <p> Today , I went to hunt dolphins with the locals . We embarked in little canoes that they called " haramakana " or " karamahana , " and we waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in silence , piously , crowns of wild magnolias around our necks , so that we resembled a funeral or a wedding procession . I do n't want to make you jealous in describing their women , even though you have no reason to worry . They consider the color of my skin a sign of anemia and of extreme weakness , and they treat me with the same compassion they show a sick person . <p> The hunters were all infinitely sad and solemn , and I was n't sure what was wrong with them . When with a lot of skill they reeled in a dolphin in their canoe , they cried in silence as one cries in our land , in Europe , at the death of someone dear . This was not some frenetic ritual dance as we would imagine . There was a sincere and proud sniffing , discreet and calm , full of nobility . <p> " You do n't have to pretend , " said one of the locals when , out of courtesy , I put my handkerchief to my nose . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " Then , that is different , " said Tam-Tam . " You white men , you pretend a lot . You consider it proper and polite to partake at all cost in the joys and suffering of others . Here , it is a sign of impoliteness and of poor upbringing . Why , for example , would you cry now ? " <p> " Because of the dead dolphins ... like you , besides , " I said while blowing my nose in my handkerchief to show that I was neither a hypocrite nor ill-mannered . <p> " What an idea ! " said Tam-Tam . " To cry because of the dolphins ! We are crying because we are obliged to slap the moonlight with our oars . " <p> Their oars were hardly touching the surface of the water . <p> The Bay of Dolphins , June <p> I do n't know , dearest one , if I will be able to send you these letters , but I write them nevertheless . Here , there is no postal service , and no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " letter " or " correspondence . " But I write you anyway because I think a monologue is something deeply dishonest and egotistical . I would be capable of killing myself if one day I discovered that a monologue would be enough to make me content . But if I succeed in one way or another in sending you these letters , I will deprive myself of the pleasure of seeing you discover in my eyes the moonlight of the Bay of Dolphins . <p> Do you know how these marvelous savages confess their love ? <p> When the young man is ready for tenderness , that is to say when he has tasted all the vices and has taken part in all the orgies , he waits for the Pan-Dolphin ceremony ( which falls between the first of May and the seventh of January according to our calendar  --  when the moonlight is the strongest and the clearest ) to approach the young girl who had appeared more than seven times in his dreams . This , however , is considered , perhaps with reason , as a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . These are the strange and incomprehensible things for us Europeans . We would keep secret the fact that the same young girl appeared seven times in our dreams , and we would announce to the parents of the girl that we are prepared to marry their only daughter ( to the extent that our material situation would give us the right to make such a proposition ) . With them , however , that a man dreamed about the same woman seven times or more is considered a mortal sin and a profanation of the sacred character of dreams ( they consider , in fact , that to describe as one tells a story the images and contents of dreams with their poor language of three hundred to four hundred thousand words and as many symbols would be an absurd and pretentious blasphemy ) . On the other hand , not to confess a fundamental and essential fact is considered a hypocrisy and a Europeanism . And they think that a man who is not capable of dreaming of the same woman seven times is brainless and an idiot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not see the moonlight upon which they depend and to which they are bound by blood , as we Europeans are bound to the sun and hypocrisy . <p> But here is how it happens at the Bay . That day , when the moonlight is most sonorous , the young man takes his chosen one by the hand and directs her to Tanga Sihaka ( the cliff of love ) . There , under the moonlight , without a word , he gazes into her eyes for hours and hours . Then , after this silent confession , after this mono-dialogue , he lifts from his torso his sharp knife ( a type of curved dagger ) and cuts the vein on his left hand . During this entire time , he never stops looking at her , so that she can see in his eyes how life begins to fail him and his eyes begin to grow pale . Then , if she thinks that she loves him , she also takes the dagger .... <p> " And if she does not love him ? " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with him as he bleeds , " he said . <p> " Otherwise , " I said . <p> " Then she leaves him to die next to her . As soon as the moon disappears , she rips out his heart and throws it to the dolphins . This is why dolphins are so inclined to love . " <p> " Strange , " I said . " Why is that so ? " <p> " Because , " said Tam-Tam as if playing teacher , " after the night when a man has proven that his heart is no longer his own , it can no longer serve anyone or anything else . If the woman to whom his heart was sacrificed does not want to take it , it is not good for anything else except to be thrown to the dolphins . " <p> " That 's cruel , " I said to myself , but it seemed he heard me because he added : <p> " We others do not tolerate compromise as you Europeans do . And this I believe is honest : How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice ? " <p> " Tam-Tam the wise man , " I said , " but what happens to those who have cut their veins on the cliff ? " <p> " Nothing , " he said . " They love each other . " <p> " I know , " I said , " but they cut their veins . " <p> " Holy Moon , " he said , " you are naive . " <p> " Why naive ? " I asked . " Did n't you say that they cut their veins ? " <p> " Perhaps I told you that , but who knows if they really did it . " <p> Today after the ceremonies and the Pan-Dolphin orgies , I asked Tam-Tam to help me translate the song that was sung the evening before with the musical accompaniment of a tam-tam and which received the most votes at the choral festival . But I must tell you first how the selection and voting take place . After each number is announced , a singer mounts an improvised stage and sings his song . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own judgment pulls out some hair . The hair is collected in a receptacle made of shells , and at the end the strands of hair are counted by specially trained parrots who cry out the name of the victor . Tam-Tam pulled out such a huge lock of hair for this song that , when I saw him this morning , above his forehead he had a glossy bare patch the size of an egg . <p> At first he agreed to translate , then he started to think . <p> " It is difficult to translate , " he said . <p> " Let 's try anyway , Tam-Tam . " <p> Finally , after a bit of persuading , sitting in the shade of a palm tree at the edge of the shore , Tam-Tam started to sing : <p> I brought her back some shells and pearls from Senegal ( Because I had to dive . I have a bleeding liver ) I brought her back coral from Cocowoka ( Because I had to dig deep . I have broken fingers ) <p> I pulled out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scars of battle ) And I braided all of those things into her hair . <p> One day I did n't return from a hunt for a long time ( A leviathan dragged away my boat and I am missing my harpoon , too ) I returned defeated like a woman No one waited for me at the beach But I found my loved one in her hut She cut off half of her hair Combed out her pearls and coral I thought : she is lamenting because of me . <p> But in the hut I found Ngao-Ngao Disentangling her hair like the monkey Thali And gathering the pearls and coral like a parrot I wanted then to devour Ngao-Ngao But that would not have made the hair of my loved one grow back . <p> I thus took to the sea Looking for my leviathan In order to take the harpoon away from him and pierce it in my heart For having let my loved one cut her hair And undo the braids of pearls and coral All because of Ngao-Ngao . <p> In the afternoon I showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head : " You have n't heard this song from me . " <p> " Yes , Tam-Tam , " I said , " you sang it to me this morning under the palm trees . " <p> " No , " he said . " I sang you the song about jealousy that starts with ' Oagn-Oagn fo esuaceb lla ' and you distorted it . We call that ' ailongam . ' <p> " What does that mean ? " I asked . <p> " Ailongam , " he said . <p> " Translate it for me . " <p> " It is impossible to translate . " <p> " How is that possible , Tam-Tam ? " <p> " It is one of the twenty thousand words in my language that are impossible to translate . Ninety percent of the words in your song are equally impossible to translate . " <p> " Impossible , " I said . <p> " Then translate yourself , " he said with slight anger . <p> " Magnolia ! " I said . <p> He smirked as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or perhaps it was because he had prayed to the orange moon that was bathing its sonorous silver over the forest of magnolias in which we were walking , pensively . <p> You will tell me , Billy Goat , Wise One  --  the devil take you  --  that here there is very little an the subject of women that I want to talk about . <p> It just seems that way to you , Wise One ! <p> She is omnipresent , like the moonlight in the forest of magnolias , like my writing , my breath , like her " oh " dark and resonant , which she utters from time to time on the pages of this book ; it is the presence of her shadow , it is her breath that accompanies me . <p> Or is it my own breath ? <p> You ask yourself , Mountain Goat , what I can possibly see in this exotic land of adventure and rebellion . I am sure that you ask yourself that question  --  if you have not changed . <p> You know well , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attic , my lute , or without Eurydice . <p> I fled from myself , and I put my love to the test . But I know that I will return light years older ( I did not say wiser ) , and I know I will take up my good lute , my love , and Eurydice . <p> I wanted , Igor , to describe Eurydice , to write a poem worthy of her name . You were the first , Mountain Goat , to tell me to stop fooling around and stop running after the moon and the mist . Do you remember our conversations in the attic : <p> I : Good . I will listen to you . I will move to the ground floor and write a novel about Mary the Prostitute . About her lovers and her abortions . <p> You : OK . Do it . I will be sorry that you will leave our attic , but you must do it for the love of poetry . <p> I : It has nothing to do with poetry . It will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whore Mary Magdalene . <p> I : No . A story of the abortions of Mary the Innocent . A novel on the sociohistoric , material , ( a ) moral , ethnic , and ethical causes of her disgrace . A novel of Mary 's hopes . A novel of a place . <p> You : You are making fun of me . <p> I : Never in the world . <p> You : You know very well that I do n't think about the plot but about the atmosphere . You understand : an atmosphere saturated with luxury and hope . That is what I think of . <p> I : But how do you imagine an atmosphere of luxury and hope ? Would n't that be a plot ? I want to write that book , Igor , that book ! Without the lovers and the burdens of Mary , without the dialectics and ethics . And also without Eurydice . <p> Finally , Mountain Goat , have n't I repeated for you one hundred times that I write to liberate myself from my ego . <p> Translated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
