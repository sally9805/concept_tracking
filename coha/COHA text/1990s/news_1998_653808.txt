<p> Christina Green , a 17-year-old high school student in Delaware , Ohio , considers herself old-fashioned when she shops for groceries . Most of her friends buy meals to go , she said  --  " stuff they can eat right away or zap . " She , on the other hand , picks up frozen pot pies and breaded chicken , fish sticks and pizza , boxed macaroni and cheese . <p> " I like a homemade meal , " she said . <p> To many teen-agers , " homemade " has come to mean nothing more than " home heated . " Marian Salzman , director of brand futures at Young &; Rubicam Advertising , predicts that subtle linguistic shift might well carry right into adulthood . And major food makers are on notice . <p> With the rise of single-parent and dual-income households , sit-down breakfast has become an antiquated notion and on-the-run lunch and dinner commonplace . Indeed , as the children of baby boomers mature , the growing teen-age population may be leading the way in the home-warming , grab-gobble-and-go trend . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way America eats . They are playing a big role in the array of ready-made meals offered in supermarkets , from pasta to pizza to sweet-and-sour chicken , as well as the rise of nutrition bars . They like to snack , too , the " louder " ( read : spicier ) the better . <p> While mothers still make most grocery decisions , food ads in magazines aimed at teen-agers have markedly increased in the last five years , and food companies have established " edutainment " sites on the youth-savvy web . <p> Www.oscar-mayer.com encourages teen-agers to enter its talent search . Ragu 's " delizioso " site , www.eat.com , is aiming its new pasta sauce , Cheese Creations ! , at teen-agers . This may be the ultimate sauce for impatient cooks : it is flavored with cheese , so you do n't even need to sprinkle on the Parmesan . The site offers quick , simple recipes , a Go Mama Go ! video game and a guide to romance . <p> " Teen-agers are in a rush , looking for good taste and quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lipton , which makes Ragu . <p> Pillsbury has just introduced frozen Toaster Scrambles  --  eggs and cheese in a pastry crust . " It 's a deliberate attempt to make things ever more accessible , " said Carol Watzke , director of consumer research at Pillsbury , which usually markets to mothers . " One of the things we 're looking at now is how to develop a brand equity , a brand image , with teen-agers . " <p> Met-Rx , an Irvine , Calif. , company that makes protein drinks , food bars , frozen pizza and pasta , is rolling out a " mentor program , " complete with discounted products , to high schools in major markets . Dominick 's , the 109-store supermarket chain in the Chicago area , has a nutrition program for schools , including store tours to " teach them how to be good shoppers , " said Andrea Brands , a spokeswoman . Dominick 's is " very aware " of the popularity of prepared foods among teen-agers , she said . " We realize that is an important area to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that attracts teens into the stores . " <p> The Rand Youth Poll , which surveys about 2,700 teen-agers twice yearly , estimates that teen-agers spent $48.8 billion in grocery stores last year , more than 10 percent of total grocery-industry sales . Half the teen-agers surveyed by Teen-Age Research Unlimited in Northbrook , Ill. , said they went to a grocery store at least once a week , and 61 percent " prepare a meal " for themselves weekly . Most buy their own breakfast and lunch every day . <p> In interviews with dozens of teen-agers nationwide , a picture emerged of a generation of cool customers . <p> They scoff at product hype , are snack-hungry , brand-loyal and drawn to familiar foods . Most buy and eat on impulse ( big surprise ) rather than by judicious planning , and they are price-conscious . <p> At a convenience store on Manhattan 's Upper West Side recently , Sara Padovani , 13 , huddled backpack to backpack with Amiris Jacobo , 14 , discussing a can of potato chips . <p> Appalled by the $2.99 price , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally false , " " major rip " and " criminal . " <p> " Like maybe Lays , O.K. , you might pay more , like if you do n't have time to shop around , " said Ms. Padovani , a sophomore at Beacon High School . " But these ? I do n't think so . Teen-agers do n't have a lot of money . We have fixed incomes . " <p> Ms. Jacobo made a nod to a balanced diet , saying , " You did the salad bar at lunch ; we can get chips . " <p> But her friend was not convinced . " You only had yogurt , maybe we should get tuna or something . " <p> They decided to pick up some chicken later , for the protein . <p> " Finished food is the most rapidly growing sector in supermarkets , " said George Rosenbaum , senior vice president of the Leo J. Shapiro Company , a Chicago market researcher that specializes in restaurant and grocery store trends . " Parents tend to shop for ingredients . Teens tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study by the Food Marketing Institute found that 29 percent of those who bought prepared meals at supermarkets were aged 18 to 24 , compared with 16 percent in 1996 . The only larger age group was shoppers 65 and older , at 32 percent last year , up from 25 percent . <p> If ready-made meals keep growing this way , Mr. Rosenbaum predicted , precooked and packaged meals at supermarkets could eclipse ingredients for true homemade meals by the turn of the century . <p> Ms. Padovani , both of whose parents have full-time jobs , buys her own breakfast and lunch on weekdays , and the family sits down together for dinner three to four times a week . She sometimes cooks macaroni and cheese . " My parents work really hard , " she said . <p> Ms. Jacobo shops for family groceries four to five times a month . Her mother gives her a list , but she picks the brands . She said she would require her own children to shop , too , as it " teaches you responsibility and gives you freedom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly my Mom cooks and it 's fun , " she said . <p> Michael Wood , director of syndicated research at Research Unlimited , said most teen-agers interviewed by his organization looked forward to eating at home . With so many meals grabbed on the run , he said , " Family meals have become special events . " <p> To " have dinner " usually means eating a family meal , complete with conversation , meat and potatoes . Everything else is just " eating "  --  food that is between a snack and a traditional meal , eaten throughout the day , like yogurt , fast food , food from a salad bar or power bars . <p> The distinction between " eating " and " having dinner , " said Roger Berdusco , senior vice president for marketing at Frito-Lay , which interviews about 15,000 teen-agers a year , is having a profound effect on how and what Americans eat . " They may not be able to vote in elections , but teens rule in the grocery store , " he said . " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day . " <p> To young people , Mr. Berdusco said , a meal can be anything from cookies and salty snacks to Thanksgiving dinner . When his company brought out Doritos in the 1960 's , he said , they were a party food . " Today , chips are a meal , " he added . <p> Ms. Watzke of Pillsbury held out hope for the traditional meal . Pillsbury research shows that about half the country 's households actually cook dinners from basic ingredients . " It depends on who the parents are and how that parent thinks about her role , " she said . <p> She did acknowledge that teen-agers , left to their own devices , would snack . " When kids are choosing foods for themselves , " she said , " they go for the most convenient forms , things that are ready to eat , frozen burritos , a bowl of cereal  --  breakfast for dinner . " <p> In fact , the distinction between breakfast and lunch , dinner and snacks is rapidly eroding . Increasingly , food packagers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditionally a snack , are morphing into nutrition bars to be eaten as breakfast , lunch or dinner . Athletic drinks , fortified with proteins and carbohydrates , are being marketed to the mainstream and can make a handy meal or snack . Such products are competing with ready-to-go meals at grocery stores and traditional fast food . " We have been seeing granola bars growing and power bars being specified by an increasing number of boys as a favorite snack , " said Richard Leonard , vice president of the Zandl Group , which polls teen-agers monthly on consumer habits . <p> Foods aimed at teen-agers are constantly being fine-tuned to appeal to younger tastes , said Rory Delaney , chief food scientist at Frito-Lay . Mr. Delaney said that a generation raised on processed foods has more tolerance to spicy flavors . <p> " We steadily increase the amount of seasoning in our products , " he said . " Teens want what they call ' loud ' taste . They want saltier , spicier , cheesier . " <p> But while the flavors change , the brands teen-agers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've seen at home . The 1997 year-end survey by the Zandl Group showed that Lucky Charms and Cheerios reigned with teen-agers shopping for cereal , and the brand names that dominated every food category dated back to at least the 50 's . <p> " Teen-agers are disoriented by how quickly the world changes and disillusioned by broken promises , " said Ms. Salzman of Y. &; R. " They want stability and functionalism . Established brand names give them a sense of security . " <p> The on-the-run style of teen-agers might suggest that grocery stores in the next millennium will look like fast-food courts and dinner will be precooked nostalgia . <p> Andy Cochran , 15 , a sophomore at Gulf Breeze High School in Pensacola , Fla. , for instance , shops for " labels with history . " <p> Every Saturday , his parents drop him off at a grocery store while they do errands . He ambles up and down the aisles at a leisurely pace , picking out familiar brands of cookies , oven roasters , canned soups and vegetables . The brands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tide , Del Monte canned goods  --  predate him but not the modern era . He says he is loyal to established brands because " they taste real . " <p> He also enjoys shopping . " I love running my own buggy up and down the aisles , " he said . " It makes you look more important to your friends , and it makes you feel , like , free . " <p> Buying groceries and preparing meals has become a significant part of many teen-agers ' lives . So more retailers are stocking supermarkets with ready-to-eat meals that appeal to teen-age shoppers , like Melanie Davis , 15 , Amanda Lowe , 15 , and Andy Cochran , 15 , at a Wal-Mart in Gulf Breeze , Fla. , above .
