LIGHTING THE DOME of the late-summer heavens are the brilliant stars Vega and Deneb , 24deg apart . Each shines near a separate point on the sky toward which we are moving . Vega lies near the direction we are going if " we " means the solar system judged with respect to the stars around us - those within , say , a few hundred light-years . This direction is called the " apex of the Sun 's way " or the " solar apex . " William Herschel , who coined the term in 1783 , found it to be near Lambda ( lambda ) Herculis . This is remarkably close to the modern position , which is at right ascension 18(h) 06(m) , declination +30deg , a point in Hercules 10deg southwest of Vega . The Sun is moving this way at 19.5 kilometers per second , or 4.1 astronomical units per year . Deneb lies near the direction we are going if " we " means most of the stars in the solar neighborhood . Deneb roughly marks the forward point toward which our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the galactic center . In this sense we are flying about 220 to 250 km/sec toward Cygnus . Confusing ? The clearest description I 've seen of these two motions is Guy Ottewell 's in his book The Astronomical Companion . Picture the solar system as a leaf floating on a river , suggests Ottewell . Many others leaves are floating too , drifting slightly this way and that ; our own drift is toward the leaf called Vega . Meanwhile the entire river is flowing ( much more rapidly ) in the direction of Deneb . THE SKY AT THE SUMMER TRIANGLE HOUR Step outside on a late-summer evening and see for yourself where we 're going . For most readers , Vega is now nearly overhead in the evening . It 's at the center of the star map on the previous page , which shows Deneb not far east of overhead . Together with 1stmagnitude Altair they make up the giant , familiar Summer Triangle . What other stars and constellations deck the sky at this Summer Triangle Hour ? Our gaze is pulled immediately to the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the brightest light of moonless evenings all summer . The giant planet burns just above the charming pattern of 2nd- and 3rd-magnitude stars called the Teapot , part of the constellation Sagittarius , the centaur Archer . By connecting the star dots of Sagittarius in the right way , it 's possible to draw a cartoonish stick figure of an archer straining to pull a bow . This figure corresponds tantalizingly well to ancient descriptions of the stars ' positions in Sagittarius 's body . But on our constellation map on the previous page , we 've drawn Sagittarius as the much easier-to-see Teapot . Photograph How many constellations can you recognize here ? This view of the summer Milky Way matches the southward view on our all-sky map on the previous page . The Sagittarius Teapot is just skimming the trees , Altair in Aquila shines brightly at upper left , and part of Capricornus intrudes from the lower left . This photograph by Carl Milazzo of Getzville , New York , reaches magnitude 8 ; the sky map shows stars to magnitude 4.5 . Milazzo used a 24-mm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // If you 're lucky enough to have a fairly dark observing site , something else will lead you inexorably south : the glorious band of the Milky Way running down the sky from near the zenith to its widest and most splendid in Sagittarius . In the southeastern sky are the autumn constellations Capricornus and Aquarius and the western fish of Pisces , better known as the Circlet . All are famous but faint . Luckily , as the evening continues two bright objects come to the rescue : Saturn low in the east and Fomalhaut low in the southeast . They 're visible as early as nightfall by the end of September . Above Saturn , the Great Square of Pegasus balances on its southeast corner . Pegasus , the Flying Horse , extends his long neck and lunging head to the upper right . His 2nd-magnitude nose , Enif or Epsilon ( E ) Pegasi , points up toward tiny Delphinus , the Dolphin . From the lower-left corner of the ascending Great Square , Andromeda arcs toward her rising hero , Perseus , low in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Queen . Above her is her rather dim-starred husband , Cepheus , and his even dimmer modern companion , Lacerta , the Lizard . The north is bare below Polaris . In the northwest on our map the Big Dipper is sweeping fairly low , and its constellation Ursa Major , the Great Bear , has already sunk almost knee-deep in horizon mist and murk . Facing west , we find Arcturus at the same height as the Big Dipper . Above Arcturus is Corona Borealis like a letter C tilted backward , and above Corona is the similar-size Keystone of Hercules . We complete our circuit around the rim of the sky by looking southwest . Here dramatic Scorpius is well past its prime height , but it 's still not too late for good looks at twinkling Antares and other illustrious Scorpius treasures . This is an especially nice area for binoculars . Now , do you have a lounge chair or sleeping bag to lie back on ? Point your feet east , lie flat , and behold Deneb near the center of the sky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface of a world madly racing toward this brilliant star . Stretched across Deneb from north-northeast to southsouthwest is the dreamy white Milky Way band . You are staring sideways into the disk of the Milky Way galaxy , toward which the galactic rotation is hurling us . THE SUN , MOON , AND PLANETS IN SEPTEMBER It 's a rich month for solar-system displays . The most exciting is the total eclipse of the Harvest Moon visible from most of North America on the night of September 26th . The bright object kindling just 2deg from the Moon that night is Saturn , at its brightest and biggest of the year ; see page 68 . Saturn shines in the evening sky throughout September , as does Jupiter . There is also spectacle before dawn : Venus is at its highest possible , with Mars , Castor , and Pollux near it early in September . Finally , Mercury pops into excellent view low in morning twilight near month 's end . Photograph During the evening bright Jupiter shines above the Teapot pattern of Sagittarius ; in mid-September the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waning crescent passes bright Venus and faint Mars on September 8th and 9th . These diagrams are drawn for one hour after sunset and before sunrise as seen from 40deg north latitude . // Jupiter is at its highest in the south conveniently early in evening twilight during September . All month the brilliant cloud world stays enthroned just to the upper left of the top star of the Teapot , Lambda Sagittarii . Binoculars or a telescope shows the striped globe creeping slowly eastward against the background stars during September , passing just 1/2deg north of another magnificent ornament of heaven : the superb globular cluster M22 . At least , M22 is superb when seen in a dark field . Jupiter , 1,000 times brighter , will tend to overwhelm it ! Jupiter in September is at the most southerly declination of its 12-year trip around the zodiac : - 23deg 24 ' ' . Pluto , in Ophiuchus just north of Scorpius , is heading down in the southwest right after dusk . If you 're ready for a major challenge you can consult page 71 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a half constellation east of Jupiter near the Sagittarius-Capricornus border . They can be enjoyed in the south after nightfall with just a little optical aid . A map to identify them is on page 70 of the April issue . Saturn is at opposition on the evening of September 26th , just hours before the Moon is at opposition ( full phase ) . This is the night of the Moon 's eclipse , and as a matter of fact the Moon is skirting closest to Saturn right around mideclipse , which should make for quite an unusual sight . As seen from North America the two will be only 2deg apart . Details are on page 69 . Photograph The Sun , Moon , and planets against the stars . The Sun and planet dots are positioned for mid-September , on colored arrows that show their motions throughout the month . The Moon is plotted every few days on its black path .

For more on libration see June 1992 , page 670. // Saturn is an engaging object all September . It rises due east earlier in the dusk each week . Later in the evening it moves up into the southeastern sky , shining to us from a secluded section of Pisces at magnitude +0.5 , its brightest in several years . The flattened globe of Saturn appears 19 " wide at the equator , its largest of the year , and the rings are narrow and dramatic , tilted 5deg from our line of sight . This is the last season we 'll see the rings so narrow for a dozen years . In 1997 their tilt will be about 10deg . Venus and Mars rise together a little north of east around 3 a.m. daylight saving time as September begins . This is the peak of Venus 's highest morning apparition ( for midnorthern skywatchers ) in its 8-year cycle of apparitions . Early risers will find the planet in interesting surroundings ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of Castor and Pollux . Venus starts the month just to the right of Mars ; the planets stay within 3deg of each other on the mornings of September 2nd through 5th . For the rest of the month Venus moves increasingly far below Mars . Shining at magnitude - 4.2 , Venus glides less than 3deg south of the center of M44 , the Beehive star cluster in Cancer , on the mornings of September 12th to 14th . Mars , 200 times fainter at magnitude +1 1/2 , follows behind , going right across the southern side of the cluster on the morning of September 21st . Both of these lovely events will be best seen in binoculars or a wide-field telescope . By month 's end Venus has descended to within So of Regulus , which it will closely pass on October 3rd and 4th . Mars , meanwhile , hangs back in Cancer . Telescopes show Venus 's increasingly gibbous form shrinking from 21 " to 16 " in diameter during September . Mars 's tiny disk appears only a quarter to a third this size . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before its opposition next March ! Mercury is in inferior conjunction with the Sun on September 17th . But each day thereafter it rises 7 or 8 minutes earlier ( as seen from midnorthern latitudes ) , rocketing up into dawn visibility . On which morning can you first see Mercury low due east about 30 to 40 minutes before sunrise ? By September 's end , Mercury is in plain view near the peak of its best morning apparition of the year . The last-quarter Moon occults Aldebaran on the morning of September 4th for Alaska , northern Canada , and the Arctic ; elsewhere we see a near miss . On September 8th the slender lunar crescent stands only a few degrees to the right of Venus and Mars . The next morning it is underneath them . New Moon occurs on September 12th , and first quarter comes on the 20th . That evening Jupiter shines to the Moon 's lower left . The full Harvest Moon becomes totally eclipsed on the night of September 26-27 while just a couple degrees from Saturn ; see page 69 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 2:00 p.m . Eastern Daylight Time on September 22nd . The Sun is crossing the equator heading south , ushering in autumn for the Northern Hemisphere and spring for the Southern Hemisphere .
