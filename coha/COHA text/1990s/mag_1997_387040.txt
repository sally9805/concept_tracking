Chocolate Squash Cake with Zucchini Frozen Yogurt // Harvest zucchini , golden crooknecks , and pale-green pattypans while they 're young to capitalize on their delicate flavor This abundant crop offers busy cooks endless opportunity Most novice gardeners have an amusing story to tell about the avalanche of squash they reaped the season they planted the entire package of zucchini seeds . Easy to grow , a healthy zucchini plant can produce up to eight pounds of squash in a season . This amounts to a whole lot of zucchini if you sow a full packet of 20 to 30 seeds , which is what I did as a beginning gardener some two decades ago . I have since learned to plant only a handful of seeds from each packet of summer squash that I select for my garden plot . Two or three plants should yield plenty to feed a family of four , with some to give away , too . Photograph // Summer squashes include a number of different members of the Cucurbitaceae ( or gourd ) family of warmweather vegetables . The most common-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are yellow crooknecks and straightnecks and the less-known pattypan , a pale-green squash with a scalloped edge . All of these vegetables grow quickly and must be picked before their skins and seeds have had time to harden and mature . Summer squashes should be refrigerated after harvest and should be eaten within a few days of harvest . I grew up eating the old-fashioned pale-green pattypans . My mother frequently stir-fried the squash with garlic , soy sauce , and fermented black beans , an Asian condiment that is now readily available in gourmet markets and specialty-food stores . When pattypans were unavailable , she would substitute zucchini . In those days , yellow crooknecks and straightnecks rarely came to market . Today , though , an abundance of yellowskinned squashes appears in grocery stores and at farm standsnot just crooknecks and straightnecks , like ' Dixie ' or Seneca Butterbar ' , but also a yellow scalloped variety called ' Sunburst ' and a golden zucchini , which some consumers find less bitter than their dark-green counterparts . No longer can all the zucchini we find be described as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green like the ' Clarimore ' , bright yellow like the Gold Rush ' , or round like Ronde de Nice ' ( a variety also known as Roly Poly ' ) . Delicate round zucchini , a French heirloom , is much sought after in farmers ' markets , although they are rarely produced commercially because their tender , pale-green skins bruise easily . Ideal for stuffing , round zucchinis range from golf ball to orange size . Saute the petite ones or grill them on skewers . Easy to prepare , summer squashes possess a mild flavor that makes them excellent additions to everything from grilled kabobs to frozen yogurt . They 're abundant all season long , so feel free to be inventive . L . W. // CULTIVATING SUMMER SQUASH // SUMMER SQUASH // SUMMER SQUASH // <p>
