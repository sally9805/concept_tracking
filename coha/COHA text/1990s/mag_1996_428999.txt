MORE THAN two millenniums have passed since Anaxagoras of Clazomenae realized that lunar eclipses are caused by the Earth 's shadow . But to this day , lunar eclipses still harbor mysteries . One of the more peculiar ones is a measured enlargement of Earth 's umbra , first noted by Philippe de La Hire in 1702 . Indeed , numerous lunar-eclipse observations over the last three centuries attest that the Earth 's umbra appears about 2 percent larger than predicted for the geometry of the situation . Today most astronomers agree that the swollen shadow is due to Earth 's atmosphere . But what exactly causes the phenomenon ? The notion of an enlarged umbra should not be new to seasoned Sky &; Telescope readers . Since 1956 , editor Joseph Ashbrook ( who passed away in 1980 ) and associate editor Roger Sinnott have determined the size of Earth 's umbra at the Moon 's distance by analyzing thousands of crater timings ( observers ' estimates of when the edge of the umbra crosses the center of a crater ) . Ashbrook and Sinnott consistently found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifty Year Canon of Lunar Eclipses : 1986-2035 , Fred Espenak speculates that the enlargement might be caused by sunlight passing through a layer of meteoritic dust suspended 120 to 150 kilometers high in the Earth 's atmosphere . But the shadow enlargements seem to vary from one eclipse to the next , hinting at a more complex atmospheric mechanism . MODELING SHADOW ENLARGEMENT To understand the dynamics of this phenomenon more completely , I created a computer model of our atmosphere that factors in the propagation of light by various gases , the effects of clouds , and even limb darkening on the Sun 's disk . The model 's vertical structure is based on the average profile from the US . Standard Atmosphere 1976 . With this program I traced the paths of all possible rays through each part of the atmosphere and into the Earth 's shadow . The speed of today 's computers can do the calculation with such a fine grid of rays that the accuracy is set by the validity of our atmospheric model , not by the limits of numerical calculation . The diagram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes through Earth 's atmosphere . More revealing is the facing graph , which shows the model 's prediction for how the brightness of the lunar surface varies as a function of the distance from the umbra 's edge . Note that the penumbra is not colored the curves for red and blue light match each other almost perfectly . But the blue curve dives more steeply within the umbra , confirming mathematically what the human eye has long known : areas of the Moon well within the umbral shadow look reddish . Photograph Above : During a lunar eclipse , ozone in the stratosphere absorbs red light , which can make the outer edge of the umbral shadow appear blue . Conversely , the troposphere scatters blue light , causing most of the umbra to appear red . Upper left : Totality is only 17 minutes away in this image taken at 23:09 Universal Time on April 3rd . Tai Thanh Vo of Veenendaal , the Netherlands , used a 4 1/2-inch reflector at f/12 for a 4-second exposure on Kodak Gold 100 film . During the eclipse many observers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just inside the shadow near the upper limb . // The curves also confirm another effect well known to every eclipse observer : the outer penumbra is not significantly darker than the full Moon . At the center of the penumbra region ( some 1,800 km from the umbra ) , the brightness drop is only 0.7 magnitude - just enough to be discerned by a good observer . The brightness then steadily decreases until it flattens out just inside the umbra 's edge . The graph 's four red curves depict how the transmission of red light , as predicted by the model , varies with atmospheric conditions . The upper one assumes there is no absorption due to ozone , while the one below it includes ozone but neglects clouds . The third curve shows the influence of high cirrus clouds by allowing only a quarter of the rays passing below 10 km altitude to get through . Finally , the lowest red curve shows the influence of both cirrus and stratus clouds and assumes that all rays passing below 5 km altitude are blocked . Although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ozone absorption . Theoretically , ozone will darken the entire umbra , as will aerosols pumped into the lower stratosphere ( 10 to 30 km in altitude ) by volcanic eruptions . High tropospheric clouds , or cirrus , will also dim the umbra except near its edge ; this is evident when comparing the Clear redlight curve with the Cirrus clouds curve . Low clouds darken the umbra only in its central region . The Stratus/cirrus clouds curve probably represents the most realistic situation . Clouds also dim the umbra in blue light ( curves not shown ) . Since weather is not the same everywhere around the Earth 's limb , the umbra can display dark and bright patches . Each location in the umbra reveals the average weather conditions of a region more than 40deg long and a few degrees wide along the Earth 's terminator . However , strong localized variations in ozone abundance , stratospheric aerosols , or noctilucent clouds will change the brightness significantly along the outermost region of the umbra ( see the box on page 100 ) . A reasonable definition for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will perceive the most abrupt brightness change . From the brightness curves above , it is difficult to estimate the exact location of the steepest slope . So the inset graph offers a magnified look at brightness gradient near the umbral edge . The change in brightness occurs most rapidly ( has the steepest gradient ) approximately 90 km outside the umbra 's geometric edge , and this shift is what creates the apparent increase in the shadow 's radius . Note that the enlargement is not caused by an absorbing layer in the atmosphere , as is often suggested . Instead , it occurs because light that would otherwise occupy the innermost penumbra has been refracted by the atmosphere into the umbra . For blue light the gradient is steepest 98 km outside the geometric edge . For red light the value is 81 km , with or without the presence of clouds . However , if ozone absorption were neglected the steepest gradient would occur at 108 km . Thus , stratospheric ozone significantly reduces the apparent size of the umbra . This might seem counterintuitive , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes when approached from the outside . If there were no ozone the outer umbra would appear lighter overall , the change from penumbra to umbra would be more gradual , and the maximum in the brightness gradient would shift outward . But ozone absorbs some of the light that would otherwise enter the umbra , causing the brightness curve to be its steepest closer in ( farther toward the left ) . In summary , my theoretical results show that our atmosphere will enlarge Earth 's umbral shadow by some 90 km , with the actual value depending on the abundance of ozone . Other absorptions in the stratosphere will darken the umbra further and consequently shrink its size . For example , if aerosols from volcanic eruptions darken the outer umbra by one magnitude , the diameter will decrease by 15 km. // The author 's computer model predicts how much sunlight reaches the Moon 's surface during a lunar eclipse . A group of four curves illustrates how the Earth 's atmosphere affects the transmission of red light ( 6000 angstroms ) . Blue light ( 4500 angstroms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lower atmosphere , which is why the umbra usually appears dull red . Note how the brightness of the outermost penumbra nearly equals that of the uneclipsed Moon . Inset : We probably perceive the umbra 's edge where the change in brightness across the lunar surface is most abrupt . Because of atmospheric effects , this gradient is steepest about 90 km outside the geometric edge of the umbra for an airless Earth . The presence of ozone ( top curve ) makes the umbra look smaller than it would if , hypothetically , ozone were totally absent ( bottom curve ) . // Are there any other significant factors that might affect the umbra 's size ? Variations in the Sun-Earth distance have no measurable effect . The upper atmosphere has a given density at an altitude about 1 km higher over tropical latitudes compared to over the poles . Seasonal and diurnal variations of the vertical extent of Earth 's atmosphere also cause the umbra to increase or decrease by 1 km - again not very significant . Likewise , while the umbra 's geometric size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than at apogee , the umbral enlargement is 2 km smaller . Thus , the long-held assumption that the amount of enlargement is proportional to the size of the umbra is not true . Atmospheric refraction increases the size of the penumbra as well , though the effect is smaller than for the umbra . Based on the computer model 's plot of brightness and gradient at right , the penumbral shadow should be 60 to 70 km larger than it would be for an airless Earth . Finding the penumbral edge is no longer a theoretical exercise . While imperceptible to the human eye ( being masked by large albedo variations on the Moon 's surface ) , in principle it could be measured with modern photometric detectors . OBSERVATIONS VS . THEORY The table below shows the distilled results of thousands of eclipse crater timings made by observers worldwide since the 1970s . The mean observed enlargement for all these measurements of the umbral shadow is 91 km with a standard deviation of 9 km , in remarkably good agreement with the computer model 's prediction of 90 km @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1992 , and 1993 's have values for umbral enlargement about 10 km smaller than average . These eclipses displayed among the darkest umbras in the study , and they occurred after major volcanic events ( El Chichon in 1982 and Mount Pinatubo in 1991 ) . Both eruptions enriched the stratosphere with sulfur-based aerosols , and , as my computer model predicts , volcanic aerosols in the stratosphere should darken and shrink the umbra . As you scan the results in the table , it appears that the eclipse of October 1985 is at odds with the other results . Its enlargements show the greatest inconsistency between immersion and emersion ( 25 km ) and offer the largest value in recent times ( 111 km ) , 20 km greater than average . The immersion probed the atmosphere over Antarctica , while emersion involved midsouthern latitudes . During spring in the Southern Hemisphere , the depletion of ozone over the Antarctic - the so-called " ozone hole " - becomes most pronounced in October . Once again , my model predicts that a depletion of ozone should increase the umbra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ozone hole will occur on November 9 , 2003 . Recent measurements by spacecraft show that the ozone depletion is creeping into the middle latitudes . Thus , we may not need to wait seven years to note how this life-protecting layer affects lunar eclipses . For example , on March 24 , 1997 , mideclipse will probe Arctic latitudes . If the abundance of ozone is high , the umbra 's outer edge should appear quite blue . September 's total lunar eclipse ( see page 68 ) once again offers great potential for furthering our knowledge of how changes in the atmosphere can alter the size of Earth 's shadow . Of course , for this work to continue we still depend on your observations . So get ready !
