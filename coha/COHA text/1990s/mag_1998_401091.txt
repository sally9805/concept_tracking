Three Scout groups . Three countries . Two lot of fun . A little confusion can be a lot of fun . // The Scouts at least agreed on one thing : Everyone was different . That offered some consolation . Because , from the start , everything about this canoe trek through Canada last August with American , Danish and Canadian Scouts seemed to confuse and contradict . Never mind language differences . Take canoe paddle differences as an example . Eleven Canadian Venture Scouts looked down upon the bent-shaft paddles wielded by Scouts of Troop 125 , Okemos , Mich . " We like the regular straight Canadian paddles , " said Kerry McKibbin , 16 , from Don Mills , Ontario . And take geographical differences . Twenty Scouts from Denmark wondered about people who lived among such hills and woods . " We do n't have any tall spots at all , " explained Jesper Kaerecaard , an 18-year-old Danish Senior Scout . And take cultural differences . The Americans marveled at the Danes , a very close-knit group . Star Scout Zac Barry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Danish Scouts sure hold hands a lot , " he said . Before they had time to think much more , though , the Scouts mixed up into multinational crews . Then they plunged into the wilderness of Canada 's Killarney Provincial Park . Nine days of high adventure later , they emerged fast friends . " Having Scouts from all the different countries together was great , " Zac says . " We ended up making lots of friends . " Mixing It Up Photograph Which way to Canada ? Scouts Shawn Curtis ( left ) and B. J. Gawle head north , where they 'll swap stories , tips and pins with a multinational group . // The trip last July was organized by Troop 125 and the Canadian and Danish Scout groups . The Danes spent four days in Toronto , then traveled with the Canadians to Killarney , where they met with the 51 - Michiganders . Though things were awkward at first , the Scouts learned the countries share surprising similarities . Like the night the Danes pulled songbooks out of their packs . Jon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some odd sounding and incomprehensible songs . Instead , the Danes broke into some Beatles tunes , in English yet . Jon did the natural thing and joined in . Besides loving American music , all the Danes spoke excellent Englishwhen they wanted to . When talking to each other , they often used their native tongue . Add the fact that in Denmark as well as Canada , girls can be Scouts ( and several on this trip were ) , and it gets strange . " Sometimes you 'd have three girls talking at once and we did n't have a clue to what they were saying , " complained Jon . The Danes and Canadians were equally puzzled by U.S. Scouts ' attitudes ecs toward co-ed camping . " It is very funny to see the boys with us girls , because they 're not used to that , " laughed Katherine Wulss , a 15-year-old Done . She did stop joking long enough , however , to teach the U.S. Scouts to count to 10 in Danish . She also taught them the Danish greeting , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' Just Add Water ' Scouts The Michigan Scouts noticed differences with the Canadians too . For one thing , Zac says , " Their food is always better because they actually cook it instead of just adding water . " The Americans all ate the same freeze-dried chow . That led some foreign Scouts to jokingly call them the " just add water " Scouts . And the Danes discovered the American boys eating strange substances they had never seen before : peanut butter and squeeze cheese . On Dry-Ouch ! - Land Two or three times a day , the Scouts had to portage . The canoes had to be emptied , hauled out and carried anywhere from a few yards to nearly a mile to the next lake . The terrain ranged from rocky to swampy but usually included hills . And , observed 12-year-old First Class Scout Michael Voice , " Portaging up a hill with a canoe is pretty hard . " But if a canoeist has to portage uphill , he might as well do it in Killarney . It 's an outdoorsman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a spectacular range of white quartzite ridges , pine and hardwood forests and low-lying bog areas . Animal Experiences The clear water in the Killarney lakes comes from acid rain that has killed most water-dwelling plants . Acidic water makes for lousy fishing . But there 's lots of life on land . Michael Voice 's favorite encounter happened early one morning . " We came up on about 10 loons in the canoe and got so close , " he says . " It was really cool . " A snapping turtle , deer , beaver , friendly camp foxes and one fortunately far-off bear also livened up the trip . Then there were the animals that might have been there .

Friends Across the Water When the canoeing was over , the Michigan Scouts said goodbye to their new Canadian friends . Then they loaded up the Danes for a visit stateside . The visitors stayed with Scout families in and around Okemos for a week . They went to an international camporee and saw the sights of America . At the end , the Detroit airport was full of crying , hugging Scouts of two nations . They swapped e-mail addresses too , and Troop 125 is planning to travel to the 1999 Danish national jamboree in Copenhagen . In the end , cooperation instead of conflict was the theme . " I really liked how the three countries worked together , " says Zac . " We came together with people we 'd never met before and by the end we were working together pretty well .
