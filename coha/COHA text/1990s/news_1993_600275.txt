<p> Old Jack City . Unfo'given . Boyz N the Saddle . <p> Yeah , yeah . Mario Van Peebles has heard all those cowpoke jokes already , cracked by uptight-in-the-saddle studio types who scoffed at the idea of a black-themed Western . <p> The actor/director , who quickly was dubbed " Mario , bay-bee ! " by Hollywood bigwigs after his 1991 urban drug drama New Jack City scored $ 40-million-plus at the box office , just hitched his wagon to a smaller and more appreciative British company instead . <p> But the other day , he got a taste of how the actual public might brand his latest movie . <p> Co-screenwriter Dario Scardapane called to report , " I was standing outside a movie theater , and these two ladies were looking at the Posse poster . And one said , ' Oh , they 're cute . ' But the other one said , ' Yeah , but black cowboys . Who are they kidding ? ' " <p> No one . Posse , galloping into about 950 theaters Friday , is n't just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hefty slice of American pie that somehow got left behind in the cinematic sagebrush . <p> The story of Jessie Lee ( a highly Clintonian figure - as in Eastwood , not Bill - played with steely-eyed grit by Van Peebles ) and his wild bunch may be the stuff of pulp fiction . We 're talking gold bullets cast from purloined coins , bawdy-house brouhahas and shootouts with six-guns a-blazing . <p> But details like the front-line status of segregated black cavalrymen during the Spanish-American War and the rise of all-black utopian communities represented by the fictional Freemanville in Posse are rooted in fact . <p> " It 's so important that the West be pictured as it was , not some lily-white John Wayne adventure story , " says William Loren Katz , author of The Black West ( Open Hand Press , $ 15.95 ) and Black People Who Made the Old West ( Africa World Press , $ 14.95 ) . " A whole heritage has been lost to generation after generation of schoolchildren , black and white . " <p> Well , Pilgrim , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roamed the range was black ? And that of the first 44 settlers of Los Angeles , 26 were black . And 30 all-black towns were built in Oklahoma between 1890 and 1910 . Even Tone-Loc , the rapper/ actor who 's Angel in Posse , swallowed the white-bread version of the West while growing up in Texas . And he has relatives who migrated to California and were cowboys . <p> " I never wondered how come there were no brothers in Westerns , " he says . " The way they had you believe , ( the white cowboys ) were the only ones around . Basically , you just accepted it - until now . " <p> Just how did this part of the West go un-won in textbooks and in Tinseltown ? Katz believes it comes from a long-ingrained inclination to portray blacks and other minorities as second-class citizens for economic and social reasons . " The tale of frontier blood , sacrifice and conquest has bonded white citizens and established exactly who built the country - and who did n't . " <p> Even in classrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , after the Civil War , blacks went home and went to sleep and did n't wake up until Martin Luther King . " <p> Of course , Hollywood 's further whitewashing of the West clouded the picture even more . One of the more blatant examples : Tomahawk ( 1951 ) , which featured white actor Jack Oakie as legendary black frontiersmen Jim Beckwourth . As Katz says , " Audiences learned Beckwourth was important , but not that he was black . " <p> Throughout the years , the movies occasionally served up blacks in Westerns , even if ignoring the historical events . These offerings vary from the singing cowboys in " race " films of the ' 30s and ' 40s ( Bronze Buckaroo , Harlem Rides the Range ) to the racially relevant Westerns of the ' 60s ( The Professionals , Major Dundee ) to ' 70s-style blaxploitation ( Fred Williamson in The Legend of Nigger Charley ) and liberalism ( Sidney Poitier 's Buck and the Preacher ) . <p> In the ' 80s , it was common to cast black stars in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lonesome Dove ) , a tradition carried on by Eastwood 's Oscar-winning Unforgiven . But it 's a portrayal that author Donald Bogle ( Blacks in American Films and Television , Simon &; Schuster , $ 22.95 ) finds unsatisfying . After all , with the passage of post-Reconstruction laws that denied land ownership and voting rights to blacks , racism thrived in the West as well . <p> " It 's good to know that any actor could play the roles they play and that the black actor has a chance . But , for me , it was disappointing when Gene Hackman brutalized Morgan Freeman with no reference to his race . They had no trouble referring to the women as bitches and whores . " <p> Posse , on the other hand , is fairly steeped in race , although Van Peebles shuns the label " black Western " - as he points out , no one called Unforgiven a " white Western . " He took care to cast one white actor ( Stephen Baldwin of TV 's The Young Riders ) as part of Jessie Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Unless we see the world a little like a Benetton ad , no one is moving forward . " <p> But how do you make today 's audiences feel at home on the range ? With plenty of sex and skin ( including a butt-naked swim scene ) , gunfire that explodes like a Fourth-of-July sky and contemporary references ( echoing Rodney King , comic veteran Nipsey Russell implores , " Ca n't we all just get along ? " ) . <p> But Van Peebles also makes a nod to the old , with vintage cameos ( Pam Grier , Robert Hooks , Isaac Hayes , Mario 's dad , Melvin ) plus homage to probably the greatest black Western star ever - Woody Strode , who lends his trademark dignity to the beginning and end of Posse . While never an actor of the caliber of a Sidney Poitier , " He does represent a major shift of images , " Bogle says . " Visually , he made a great statement . There was nothing servile about him . " <p> Says Van Peebles of Strode , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberty Valance and Sergio Leone 's Once Upon a Time in the West as well as non-oaters like Spartacus : " He 's the granddaddy . He was the first black cowboy I remember who did n't shuffle . " <p> Strode , a 6-foot-plus former football star and wrestler who turns 79 in July , remains an imposing figure in his Posse role , which he calls a " bookend . " <p> But Posse ca n't compare to the high point of his career : 1960 's Sergeant Rutledge , the Ford Western that finally arrives on video in June . <p> " If it had n't been for John Ford , I would never have been on a horse , " Strode says . With Rutledge , the tale of a black cavalry soldier wrongly accused of rape and murder who turns out to be a heroic figure , Ford appeared to be making amends for earlier films that exploited the likes of Stepin Fetchit . As Strode once observed : " You never seen a Negro come off a mountain like John Wayne before . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " He was like a father to me . I told him , ' You 're going to turn into Abraham Lincoln . ' " Strode also appeared in Ford 's Two Rode West and Seven Women . <p> With some 60 Westerns posed to mine the same gold as Unforgiven , at least Posse is the first to stake a claim with movie audiences . But historian Katz believes it 's an important step . " Posse opens a small door on a vast history . " <p> And just like in Posse , perhaps it 's best to let Strode speak last . " It 's amazing that I got to live to see a black kid star in his own picture and get studio money and be a director . Then I know there 've been some changes . " <p> Ride ' em , cow bro.
