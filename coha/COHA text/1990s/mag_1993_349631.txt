Producer John Langley was screening a rough cut of his new Fox network show Cop Files a couple of weeks ago , and he was n't happy . In one scene , a female police officer surprises a burglary suspect in a warehouse ; he attacks her savagely , then she shoots him in self-defense . When Fox censors objected to the violence , Langley was forced to make drastic excisions . " It was absurd , " he says . " The pressure was on us to de-emphasize the attack , so you wound up showing her shooting him without any motivation . " Langley , like many others in Hollywood , knows the reason for this outbreak of squeamishness : the networks have suddenly got religion on the subject of violence . <P> After several rounds of congressional hearings that aired concerns about violence on TV , the four networks last month announced a joint response . Starting in September , they will attach a warning label  --  DUE TO SOME VIOLENT CONTENT , PARENTAL DISCRETION ADVISED  --  to shows with high levels of mayhem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before junketing TV journalists in Los Angeles to stress their concerns about violence  --  and assert that they are n't the only ones to blame . Next Monday a heavyweight lineup of TV producers , network executives and other industry bigwigs will meet to explore the violence issue at a daylong " summit conference " sponsored by the National Council for Families and Television . <P> Initial reaction to the networks ' labeling plan was predictably skeptical . Critics , from conservative watchdog Terry Rakolta to earnest newspaper columnists , complained that the warning label was a cop-out , a Band-Aid solution that would not reduce violence but would simply point out more clearly where to find it . But as production for the new season gets under way , the impact of the new label is shaping up as substantial , maybe even crippling . The Clean Up Your Network campaign may help make TV safer for kids , but it will almost certainly make network programming even blander than it already is . <P> The irony of the current outcry is that it comes at a time when violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 10 or 15 years ago , the prime-time schedules were packed with turbulent crime shows like The A-Team , Miami Vice , Hunter and Hill Street Blues . These have all but disappeared , replaced by sitcoms , magazine shows and " soft " dramas like L.A. Law and Northern Exposure . Violence is largely confined to a few reality shows , Cops , America 's Most Wanted , and true-crime TV movies  --  which are abundant but whose violence looks positively prim beside the brutality of any Lethal Weapon sequel or Schwarzenegger extravaganza . <P> Still , faced with public concern about the effect TV violence might be having on young viewers , the networks have vowed to scrub their houses even cleaner . The label itself may turn out to be sparingly used . Network officials say few , if any , of their regular series will be so branded ; only Steven Bochco 's racy new cop show for ABC , NYPD Blue , has been singled out as likely to get a weekly warning .
