If you could tell the Hubble Space Telescope 's controllers where to point it , what objects would you choose ? Most of us have our private dream lists celestial showpieces that we 'd love to see through Hubble 's eye . But observing time is a rare commodity on the orbiting reflector , so astronomers ca n't use it just to take pretty pictures . Still , in the normal course of doing science , Hubble has taken quite a few spectacular images , including some favorite targets of skygazers . A new initiative at the Space Telescope Science Institute ( STScI ) is aimed at publicizing the best of these images and soliciting advice on new observations of especially photogenic subjects . The Hubble Heritage Project is the brainchild of STScI astronomers Keith Noll , Anne Kinney , and Howard Bond and was approved by former institute director Robert Williams . On October 21st the Heritage team released its first four images from Hubble 's archives on the Heritage Web site ( http : //heritage.stsci.edu/ ) . The team plans to unveil at least one new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such things as planets , Messier objects , and wellknown NGC objects ; ' says Noll , " because these are familiar to people . " Williams adds that it would be a shame if astronomers never used Hubble to reveal the sky 's most famous sights in high-resolution splendor . So the institute is making a limited amount of time available for new Heritage observations . " In early 1999 , we 'll put a list of three or four objects on the Web page . They will all fit the observing schedule , " explains Noll . " People will be able to vote for their favorite object and help us select the next target . " Since its launch in 1990 , Hubble has studied more than 10,000 objects , amassing a celestial photo album of more than 130,000 images of planets , stars , nebulae , and galaxies . Between the hidden treasures yet to be unearthed from this archive and the new observations soon to be made , the Hubble Heritage Project promises more beautiful pictures for some time to come .
