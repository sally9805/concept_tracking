Set sail with Tennessee Scouts as they skipper a Trident submarine deep beneath the Atlantic Ocean . // FIRE ! " Scout Zac Dalton , cruising 400 feet below the Atlantic Ocean 's surface in the U.S.S. Maryland , presses a black " trigger " to launch a 130,000pound Trident II missile and destroy its target . Good thing the 11-year-old did n't touch the red trigger . The black trigger is for drills-no missile really fired . The red trigger is for real , but its firing key is locked in a safe . Only two men , the Maryland 's weapons officer and one other officer , know the combination . The missile might have been pretend , but life aboard a U.S. Navy submarine is real nonstop action-at least for a visiting Scout-and Zac is taking an active part in it . In May 1997 , 27 Scouts and 27 adult leaders from Troop 48 of Kingsport , Tenn. , took an overnight cruise aboard the submarine . The Scouts had been invited by Commander Charles B. Hasbrouck III , commanding officer of the Maryland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an Eagle Scout from Troop 48 . The Scouts had free run of the 560-foot nuclear-powered sub-an Ohio Class ( Trident ) vessel , the class of the most powerful subs ever built-based in Kings Bay , Ga . ' I Hear a Boat ! ' Star Scout Michael Lewis and Life Scout Peter Raber are wandering through the Maryland- " very lost , " Michael says-when they are invited onto the bridge to look through the periscope . The Scouts see the U. S. S. Tennessee , another Ohio Class submarine , heading toward Kings Bay . Later , Scouts view flying fish and dolphins , and Life Scout Clay Haselton spots another vessel 13 miles away . Meanwhile , Zac is in the sonar room listening through headphones . " I hear a boat ! " he exclaims to the veteran Navy sonar operator . " It 's a bunch of clams , " the operator says , skeptical of the kid 's claim . " No , I tell you it 's a boat . " " It 's not a boat , " the operator says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Background photo : As any sailor knows , Scouts of Troop 48 are set for smooth sailing once they spot good-luck dolphins riding and jumping the sub s wake . Above : Leave any fear of small spaces outside the hatch : Scouts " go below " Photograph // " It is a boat , " he tells Zac , then adds with a grin , " Why do n't you just come up here and take command ? " Let 's Shoot a Water Slug ! ' Up in the control room , Scout Clay Haselton is piloting the Maryland-Navy personnel coach him-using a steering wheel to control the cruising depth . " It was n't too hard , " he says . In fact , he says , it was boring . Shooting a " water slug " to test the torpedo equipment , however , is different . Down in the torpedo room , Zac Dalton and 10-year-old Thomas Ryland have climbed in and out of a torpedo tube three times their size . There are four tubes in the room , two on each side . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zac hits the launch button , and compressed air blasts the water out of the torpedo tube and back into the sea . The room is filled with a cloud of vapor that hangs over the Scouts like an icy fog . " It felt as if we were in a freezer , " Michael Lewis says after shooting his " water slug . " Then , wearing overalls , Scouts climb back into the torpedo tube and write their names on the walls with a grease pencil . Photograph Land ho ! At the end of a once-in-a-lifetime adventure , Scouts join their dads topside as the Maryland returns to Kings Bay . The Maryland can house a crew of 157 . Visitors must scramble for sleeping space . U.S.S. Maryland AT A GLANCE // " I got a little paranoid when I got to the end , " Michael says , " because it was real narrow , and I thought , What if the doors open and I plunge out into the sea 400 feet under water ? " ' Angles and Dangles Over the loudspeaker , Commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dangles , " and to be prepared . The maneuver is a series of dives at different angles . Despite trying to stand straight , Scouts lean forward or backward as the ship dives and climbs . As the angles increase , they have to latch on to chairs and tables-and the ceiling . Chairs fall over . Luggage goes sliding . So do Scouts . Corey Jewell watches as 10 year-old Robert Schlenker slides down a hallway . " It 's like a roller-coaster ride , " Brad Lewis says . Night Maneuvers Once the angling stops , sleepiness sets in . Makeshift beds are made throughout the ship , some between the ship 's 24 missile tubes . But the Maryland is " open " 24 hours a day . Clay Haselton finds himself under an intercom that keeps him awake . Michael Lewis does n't even bother trying to sleep . Late at night , with the Maryland cruising at a depth of 400 feet , an " emergency blow " is ordered . Compressed air fills all of the sub 's main ballast tanks , pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface . In 30 seconds , the ship shoots through the waves and plunges back into the sea with a giant splash . Later , with the ship on the surface , Michael Lewis stares at the brilliant white stars reflecting off the ocean . Others watch Navy seamen test diesel engines or missile launches . Almost no one will sleep . Photograph The Scouts were standing straight up until the submarine started diving . Angles and dangles ' reach up to 30 degrees . Daniel Chapman finds life on board is often sweet On a routine 70-day patrol , the " mess " will serve 50,000 meals . Photograph KNOW BEFORE YOU GO // <p>
