Twenty years ago Episcopal priest Loren Mead founded the Alban Institute in Washington , D. C. , to provide practical advice to clergy and congregations about ministry in local settings . Mead , whose 1991 book The Once and Future Church : Reinventing the Congregation for a New Mission Frontier attracted much attention , recently stepped down as Alban 's president . We spoke with him about his work there , about congregations , and about the future of churches in the U.S. For the past decade a great deal of research and reflection has centered on congregational life  --  perhaps more than in any previous decade , The Alban Institute has clearly been part of this development , What have you noticed about this change in interest ? Well , when I started I could n't find anybody who was interested in congregations . In 1969 there really was n't anybody around who was focusing on congregations except Lyle Schaller , who was at the Center for Parish Development , and soon after that Paul Dietrich moved in there . By and large the framework of orientation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary evil in the church . Nobody talked about congregations  --  people talked about the church . I think of H. Richard Niebuhr 's Christ and Culture . That could have been written without knowing there was such a thing as a. congregation . And Avery Dulles 's Models of the Church  --  you could read that whole thing and not really know that there were congregations . The World Council of Churches did a tremendous study in the 1960s on the missionary structure of the congregation . A lot of very seminal thinkers and ideas were put together . In the middle of the study the American . working group  --  Harvey Cox was part of it  --  started talking about real , live congregations . Then people like Bill Weber in Harlem and Gordon Cosby in Washington and others in England and Scotland started talking about congregations . When I formed the Alban Institute in 1974 , that was our interest  --  congregations . Attitudes have shifted around . In 1980 a conference on congregations was held in Atlanta , and we were astonished to discover that about 300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real explosion of people interested in working with or thinking about congregations . They are not simply the local version of the denominational reality . Is it primarily the sense of the congregation as a complex social system that generates this interest ? That is probably it . The sense that congregations are very live social systems and each one of them is quite different . And we are learning that you can understand them somewhat . There 's been a shift from the deductive approach to the inductive approach . Rather than starting with the theology and the concept of church , we start at the other end , with what is happening in church on the grass-roots level . Congregational life does not have to be a total mystery . Leading a congregation is still an art , but there are skills and tools that make a difference . I think particularly about the work done on conflict management . Conflict used to be something that would explode like a volcano in a congregation , with no sense that anything could be done . If you read the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict is the name of diversity . A church that cares about diversity , and cares about allowing individuality to be expressed , has to learn to deal with conflict . Do you think pastors are well prepared to handle conflict these days ? In general , no ; but they are eager to learn . A lot of the things that make a difference in a congregation you simply ca n't learn from a book . But when you get into the congregation , there are all kinds of learning points at which ministers are open to new understandings . Over the years that you 've been doing workshops and speaking on these issues , what changes in emphasis have you noticed ? There are a whole lot of things on the surface . There have been about 20 different models of what the clergyperson is supposed to be , from " pastoral manager " to " Christian educator " to " counselor " to " community organizer " to " consultant . " The current one is " spiritual director . " Those are the things people talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clergy to understand their role and an uncertainty about what the role entails . Many of the fights and issues in the church are covers for some difficult long-term trends . One aspect of change  --  you talk about this in The Once and Future Church  --  is that the social context of church and the definition of the pastor 's role were more settled a generation ago . Now everything seems up for grabs . The first book Alban published , in about 1976 or ' ' 78 , Stress , Power and Ministry , by Jack Harris , made that point . This is one of the long-term trends . The older ones among us remember when ministry was a profession of high status and low stress . In the course of 30 or 40 years it has become one of much lower status and much higher stress . One of the reasons I wrote my book was to talk about that . And the book does seem to have caught on . It 's sold a lot more than anything else we 've ever published . Alban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services that denominations do n't . What is your sense of the future of denominations , which seem , for financial and other reasons , to on the verge of a major transformation ? Denominations never did provide services to congregations . I started the Alban Institute because I did n't see anybody who really had a focus on the local church . And it was clear to me that if the local church is not alive , it 's not turning out people who are trying to make a difference , if it 's not connecting people to the heart of the faith , then the rest of the stuff is whipped cream . I could n't find many people in the denominational systems who really believed that . No , that 's not I true . I found a lot of people who believed that , but the systems were n't set up to deal with that . Do you think that those structure have changed in 20 years ? I do n't see a lot of change . There 's a theory about what happens when an I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second is defensive retreat . The third is acknowledgment . Fourth is adaptation . In my experience the mainline churches , the people who read the CHRISTIAN CENTURY , have hit a wall . A lot of the things they thought would work are n't working And as far as I can tell , some of the leaders have moved as far as defensive retreat . But an awful lot of people are in total denial and not even into shock yet . And I do n't see many signs of acknowledging the depth of the problem or the crisis we 're in the middle of . But a seemingly endless number of articles analyzing the " decline of the mainline churches " flows into our offices , Those kinds of articles are a sign to me of defensive retreat . We need to stop fighting each other , stop ripping each other to shreds , and blaming what 's happened on each other . This is something much larger than any denomination . It 's a change in our culture around us , and we have not adapted-well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the old thing harder or more efficiently or more effectively or sold it better , we could stop worrying . I think that 's too superficial a vision of what 's happening . Why is it that 80 percent of the people in Alabama go to church but . only 15 percent of the people in California ? What 's happening is a vast cultural change  --  and the country is moving toward California , not toward Alabama . We have n't taken into account what that means . What are the first steps in acknowledging this new world ? I see a lot of people at the middle judicatory level  --  at the synod and regional conference level  --  fighting very hard t turn their systems around . I think the big crisis is in the middle judicatory level , and that 's where in the next ten to 20 years the battles will be fought . Most local churches can go a long time without too much of a connection to a national church . You ca n't go very long without a creative support system that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is right there all the time , who 's prepared to come in when churches get in a bind , who knows them , who keeps in touch with them and helps a them face difficulty and opportunity . It is that support system that can help the congregation to look beyond itself . I 'm a strong believer that a congregation has to have a sense of being engaged in a larger mission . And that will come through its middle judicatory more than anything else . And if the middle judicatory is n't there , then the tendency to just be a local community will be accelerated . Is there anything hopeful about the fact that we may no longer have these denominational structures around ? Perhaps congregations will gain a sense of a wider church that is bigger than these institutions which emerged only in the 19th century . That 's some comfort to those who look across the land at the church in general . But I do n't see that kind of thinking energizing very many people in the local church . They are tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing some extremely hard things . I have serious questions about the financial future of the denominational systems we have . I also have real questions about our dependence upon clergy . The church as a place where a large bunch of people can make a living in leadership  --  that may have passed us by . A lot of our clergy are going to have to learn another way of living . The standard model of the congregation  --  one pastor , one congregation  --  is in deep trouble . The studies on church giving show that giving that goes beyond local churches has been going down since 1968 . This is a long-term trend and I do n't see it turning around . The aspect that I do n't hear anybody talking about and that really worries me is that the younger generation is not giving the way the older generation is . And there are fewer of them in the church . And so our total dependence on pledged income will lead us in 20 to 30 years to some extremely difficult problems if we do n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structures I see in the churches because I think optimism means we think things are going to turn out all right . I do n't se signs of that . On the other hand , I really do see what 's going on as God 's trying to give us a wake-up call , a call to be a more faithful church , to find a way to be a church for the next century . So I 've got hope , but not much optimism . If you read the headlines or the CENTURY 's news section you can get the sense that mainline churches are being torn apart over issues of homosexuality , abortion and so on , Is that how you see it ? Theologians are being torn apart over those things . I do n't run into them a lot in local churches . They are important issues and families and in some places congregations are being stretched arid pulled , but I do n't find the viciousness in congregations that I find t the national level . In a congregation I was working with not long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son had AIDS . It really scared the congregation . There was all kinds of anxiety . But the people loved the family , they struggled with the family , and they learned a lot about the disease and about , for them , very unusual lifestyles . If you asked the congregation to vote , it would never affirm homosexuality , probably would n't want homosexuals ordained . But there 's been some growth there  --  people growing in the faith . I think a lot of that is going on . And I think that 's where it 's got to happen . I do n't think the national folks make that much difference anyhow . Can you say any more about places or things that you find exciting  --  that give you reason for hope ? I 'm impressed by the kind of work Dean Hoge and his colleagues have done in Vanishing Boundaries . It 's important to understand what 's happened to the people who have dropped out of church . I think that the work my two colleagues , Speed Lees and Roy Oswald , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Congregations remain central for an awful lot of people . Even the lousy congregations . I have never found a congregation , no matter how bad , in which there were not some people there who really were deeply faithful people  --  struggling , and finding some sustenance in the congregation . I can give you an example : I grew up in a church in which nobody believed that black people and white people ought to be in the same church or community . I never had a pastor who really was for the integration of the races . But sitting in those pews I learned that we should be . The point is that the message is larger than the medium . And messages continue to go through our congregations that are greater than the people in the congregations are aware of . God always uses wounded healers . Congregations are wounded , but they do some healing . <p>
