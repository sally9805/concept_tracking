It 's not every sport that offers a guy with average athletic skills the chance to thumb his nose at gravity , to kick Newton 's butt . That 's why I took up skiing in the first place , 35 years ago , and why I 'm an enthusiast to this day . Of course , when I started , I did n't know how to turn , so my anti-gravitational activities were limited to finding natural ski jumps and soaring off them . Today , I 'm a round-turn junkie . The photo sequence below shows me doing what I like to do best : carve fast medium-radius turns , slicing an arc in the snow , and then  --  boing  --  catapulting into the next turn . Each carved turn has a rhythm , a momentary feeling of heaviness as my skis cut deeply into the snow , followed by a feeling of lightness as I squirt into the next turn . As I link a series of these boingers down 2,000 vertical feet of mountainside , my spirits soar . Each time Mr. Gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape , float free to dive into the fall line once more . I did n't learn to carve my turns in one season . It took years . But learning it was a transforming experience , and it made me realize that this experience is available to all skiers : If I could do it , you can do it , especially with the soft-flexing , easy-carving skis available today . As a longtime editor for this magazine , I 've had more advantages than most skiers : the latest and greatest gear to test , plenty of mileage on skis ( an average of 25 days a year for the past 20 years ) , and a chance to work with some of the best instructors . Over the years I 've spent thousands of hours discussing ski technique with instructors and authors , not just because it 's my job , but because I love it . I 'm a tech weenie . In the middle of summer , when the heat and humidity are wilting everyone else , you 'll often find me jumping up from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carpet . During the winter months , I like nothing better than to slope-test the instructional tips that instructors propose for publication . I 've sifted through all the tips and exercises we 've published over the past 17 years and pinpointed those that I 've found the most useful . Why these ? Of the nearly 200 instructional articles we 've published in the past decade and a half , these particular tips taught me the skills I needed at key stages in my quest to become an accomplished carver . We 're not talking the latest buzz here  --  this is classic stuff . Some of the exercises have been around 20 years or more . But they 're time-tested , and they teach important fundamentals . That 's why I 'm confident they can help you , too . This is not to say you 'll have instant results . Working on fundamentals takes time . Skiing is a work in progress , not a destination , and these tips will help you along . MY SEARCH FOR EDGING Edging is one of the essential skills of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get your skis up on edge . You 're just swiveling a flat ski . " That 's what Corky Fowler , stylish freestyler of the ' ' 60s , told me in the late ' ' 70s . At that point I thought I was a pretty fair skier . But I had no concept of what real edging felt like . It took a while to figure it out , but these exercises really helped . THE 100 PERCENT RULE Prior to 1975 , skiers often asked : How much weight should I apply to the outside ski in the turn ? Instructors were vague on this point , the majority advising their students to put " most " of their weight on the outside ski . " How much is most ? " I remember one student in a class asking . " Oh , 80 percent or so , " replied our instructor . The student was puzzled : " How can I tell what 80 percent feels like ? " Good question . Fast forward to 1978 . That 's the year Olle Larsson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outside Ski . " Illustrated with a picture of World Cup legend Ingemar Stenmark , Olle 's point was clear and unequivocal : " The mark of a great skier is the ability to stay on the inside edge of the outside ski throughout the turn . " Eight years later we published excerpts from Lito Tejada-Flores ' book Breakthrough on Skis : How to Get Out of the Intermediate Rut . Lito made the same point , eloquently , and addressed it directly to intermediates who aspire to be experts . " Expert skiers , " said Lito , " turn on one foot , one ski , exclusively . " He called this the " best-kept secret in modern skiing . " Why is this so important ? By standing fully on the inside edge of the outside ski , you bend the ski into an arc , allowing the ski to do the turning work for you . THE MISSING LINKAGE Good skiing is a rhythmic dance of interconnected turns . The hard part for most skiers is keeping the rhythm going , eliminating the hesitation between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here are some exercises that smoothed my turn transitions , and can do the same for yours . ( Exercises omitted ) HANDS OUT FRONT Not unlike many skiers , I have undisciplined hands that refuse to stay out in front of me as I ski . Just after planting the pole , my inside elbow rises like a chicken wing and then my hand drops down and back . Why ? I do n't know . For 35 years , ski instructors have explained patiently to me that keeping my hands forward is one of the key factors for stance and balance , that I ca n't hope to ski well with wild hand movements , that I should think of myself as a tightrope walker instead of an orchestra conductor as I ski . But still I find it a constant struggle . Here are three tips that have helped the most . ( Tips omitted ) <p>
