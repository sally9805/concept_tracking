<p> SAN ANTONIO  --  No one has any argument about who the four starting receivers are for the Oilers . Haywood Jeffires , Curtis Duncan , Ernest Givins and Webster Slaughter are locks for those jobs . <p> But trying to guess who will be the players that will back them up is a much more difficult task . <p> " " In years past , it was more clear cut , " said offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride . " " It was fairly obvious on seven of them , then we might have had two other guys competing for the last spot . <p> " " But now we have a lot of middle of the pack guys who are competing for those spots . The four starters are obvious , then we have about eight guys competing for four spots . They all are legitimate contenders . There 's not a big difference between any of them . " <p> Gilbride , receivers coach Charlie Baggett and head coach Jack Pardee have their work cut out for them to select the right mix of backup receivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the coaches , it even worse for the players involved . <p> " " There 's a lot of pressure on us , " said slot receiver Patrick Coleman , who has had an excellent camp . " " Some good players are not going to make this team . I just put in my mind to practice as hard as I can and perform in the games . Hopefully the guys who do n't make it will show enough in the preseason to get picked up by someone else . " That 's difficult to do for many of these players because they are too small to be considered by some teams that run a conventional offense . Only one of the candidates for a backup spot is over 5-10 ( 6-1 Reggie Brown ) and only two weigh more than 175 pounds ( Brown and Jimmy Raye ) . <p> For most of these guys , you either make it here or you do n't make it anywhere . <p> " " It 's a tough situation , but there 's not a lot you can do about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's very competitive . Everyone is fighting for a job . You want to go out there and make things happen and make big plays . But in this offense , you just have to do your job . You ca n't really make something happen on your own . You have to let it come . " <p> What Wellman means is the run-and-shoot takes advantage of what the defender gives you . It 's hard to impress people if the defense is playing soft and only giving you five-yard out patterns . <p> " " That 's why you have to come in every year and go all out if you 're not a proven starter , " Coleman said . " " I have to assume I wo n't make the team if I do n't do well . I have to be aggressive at every practice . " <p> It can be tough to get an opportunity to shine in practice if you are n't a starter . The Oilers roster for training camp had 19 receivers and two tight ends . They still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who usually plays in the slot . <p> " " You try to put something good on the field every time you get out there , " said former Houston Cougar Freddie Gilbert . " " With the number of receivers here being so high , the repetitions you get are few and far between . <p> " " If there 's only 20 plays in a script and you have 20 receivers , you might only get one play in a session , or you might not get any because the starters have to get more . Then on the one of two plays you get in , you might not get a pass thrown your way . " <p> That does n't make it any easier for the coaches to make their decisions on who stays and who goes . In the past , the Oilers have kept eight receivers on the 47-man roster . That could change this year since teams are allowed to build back up to 53 after the reach the 47-man cutdown . <p> " " We wo n't count John Henry against our eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know for sure how it will work . " <p> What comes into play in the decision-making process is which receivers can be the most help on special teams . <p> " " So much is asked of our receivers to fulfill other roles , " Gilbride said . " " We may need a certain guy to have a significant responsibility in another area . One or two have to be kickoff return guys and one has to be a punt returner . That may become the deciding factor on whether we can keep nine guys or not . " <p> The Oilers may keep a player on the merits on his kick returning abilities , like rookie Patrick Robinson , who is n't necessarily among the best eight receivers . <p> " " Right now that could very well be the case , " Gilbride said . " " Some difficult decisions are going to have to be made . " When the final cut comes , a chess match of moves is going to be played by coaches around the league . Since teams must get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaches will try to release players who they think they can slip through waivers without getting picked up by another team . <p> " " We have to try to do that , " Pardee said . " " But so does everybody else . There 's always a chance of losing someone , but that a numbers game we 'll have to play . " <p> Here an example of how it could work for the backup receivers : The Oilers keep eight receivers and choose two others they want to keep , but believe they can pass through waivers . A player who does not return kicks or punts might be easier to pass through waivers than a player who has shown a lot on special teams . <p> " " I hope we do that , but we have n't discussed it yet , " Gilbride said of the team 's cutdown strategy . " " I sure hope that would be considered . It 's hard to say which players will end up being the ones we have the most confidence in . " <p> Once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabling the Oilers to go through the year with 10 receivers on the roster . <p> " " That 's what I think they will do , " Coleman said . " " But they 're still going to have to cut some good players . " <p> Teams carry 53 players , but only 47 can be on the active roster for each weekend . Pardee sees this as a chance to do so needed shuffling at times . <p> " " We wo n't have to go in each week with just eight receivers in practice , " Pardee said . " " If we have someone banged up before a game , we can activate someone else . " <p> On top of the 53-man roster , each team can have a five-person developmental squad for young players . Receivers like Gilbert , Brown , Raye and Joe Little are possible candidates . <p> No matter what decision are made , all these receivers know they have a battle on their hands . <p> " " Who knows what they 're going to do , " Wellman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every year . Unless you are a proven starter , you have to fight for your job . " <p> The candidates <p> Here is a list of the 12 players vying for the four backup receivers spots on the Oilers initial 47-man roster , and the projected odds of making it for each one : <p> Travis Hannah ( 5-7 , 160 )  --  1-to-2 . You do n't cut fourth-round draft choices with good hands and 4.3 speed . <p> Patrick Coleman ( 5-7 , 175 )  --  even money . Has had an exceptional camp and appears to be a lock at this point . <p> Willie Drewrey ( 5-7 , 165 )  --  2-to-1 . Played well against the Saints as a receiver , but he is likely to make the team for his punt-returning abilities . <p> Patrick Robinson ( 5-8 , 175 )  --  3-to-1 . The seventh-round draft choice has n't shown much at WR , but he had two impressive kickoff returns against New Orleans . He could force the Oilers to keep him just for his kick-returning ability . <p> Leonard Harris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviously would rank among the top eight guys because of his experience and knowledge of the offense , but politics might get in the way . After sitting out the first three weeks of camp before taking a pay cut , his salary might be too high to beat out a competitor making much less . <p> Gary Wellman ( 5-9 , 170 )  --  3-to-1 . The third-year player from USC has looked sharp at camp because he knows the offense and knows how to get open , but his inability to help on specials team could hurt his chances . Wellman 's advantage is he can SR or WR and not miss a beat . <p> Damon Mays ( 5-9 , 170 )  --  4-to-1 . In a similar situation as Wellman . <p> Mays has to make the team on his receiving skills , but the coaches like him and believe he can be a contributor this season if he gets a chance . <p> Reggie Brown ( 6-1 , 185 )  --  5-to-1 . A pair of hands for which most receivers would kill , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives him a chance to stick around as the biggest backup on the team . <p> Joe Little ( 5-10 , 155 )  --  5-to-1 . The half-brother of Webster Slaughter who has shown similar receiving skills , but it might be the wrong place at the wrong time for Little . Candidate for the developmental squad . Pardee loves his work ethic . <p> Freddie Gilbert ( 5-8 , 175 )  --  7-to-1 . A sentimental favorite because he is a Huntsville native and a University of Houston product , but that wo n't be enough to win a spot . Gilbert 's one advantage is that he played in the run-and-shoot and understands the system better than most of the players against whom he is competing . Candidate for the developmental squad . <p> Jimmy Raye ( 5-9 , 185 )  --  8-to-1 . A tough kid with good hands and a knack for running tight routes , but he has n't done enough to make himself stand out . Candidate for the developmental squad . <p> Joe Campbell ( 5-8 , 175 )  --  10-to-1 . Has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his hustling attitude , but he will need a couple of stellar efforts in the next two preseason games to have a shot at making it . <p> Notes : Tight end John Henry Mills will not be counted against the eight receiver spots if he makes the team . The starters are clear-cut with Curtis Duncan and Haywood Jeffires as the wideouts and Ernest Givins and Webster Slaughter in the slot positions .
