HIS FAVORITE NOSH IS THE PICKles-and-ice-cream combo . He 's delighted with his suddenly glowing complexion . He gets anxious and whiny when his significant other leaves him home alone too much . He is , of course , pregnant . But you 've probably guessed all that . The marketing campaign has left little doubt about <P> Junior 's central joke . Sure , this is formulaic , **27;2234;TOOLONG movie-making , but nevertheless , there is a certain irresistible curiosity about seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger mime the rituals of expectant motherhood . Go ahead , surrender to it . It wo n't make you a better person , but it might , very briefly , make you a happier one . <P> Schwarzenegger is a scientist named Dr. Alex Hesse . With hustling Larry Arbogast ( Danny DeVito , Schwarzenegger 's Twins costar ) , he has developed a drug that promises to help women carry difficult pregnancies to full term . The Food and Drug Administration refuses them permission to test it , so they steal an embryo , fertilize it and implant it in Alex 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word we want  --  takes its course . The Kevin Wade-Chris Conrad screenplay takes some humorless pains to make this science fiction plausible , and it 's smart of director Ivan Reitman to be patient with all that . The more that Schwarzenegger 's predicament seems real , the funnier it is . <P> Schwarzenegger gives a soberly befuddled performance as a man pleasantly surprised , and ultimately transformed , by the play of alien hormones to which he 's host . Giddiness ( and most of the film 's knockabout comedy ) is left to Emma Thompson as a bright , klutzy fellow scientist , and she is a lovely reminder of our screwball yesteryears . Like all concerned with Junior , she refuses to let it rest lazily on its concept . The result is a high-energy farce that is more endearing and , yes , more believable than it has any right to be .
