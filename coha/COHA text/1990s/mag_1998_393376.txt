Section : BEN STEIN 'S DIARY Saturday <p> <p> An unusual day . I am up early to go down to CBS Television City to be a guest star , hee-hee , on the new " Hollywood Squares , " starring Whoopi Goldberg and Tom Bergeron . It 's a funny show , and it 's supposed to be a big celebrity thing , so I am very happy and flattered to do it . I have a really nice dressing room . Its only problem is that the couch has been sprayed with some evil fabric stain repellent . I am wildly allergic to all such chemicals and start to hyperventilate when I get near them . Luckily , there was a blanket in the closet that I could use as a shield . I know people scoff at claims of allergies to chemicals . But I assure you they are deadly serious and real . <p> At makeup and hair , we were all talking about the Starr Report . It was really interesting how reaction to it fell out . By and large , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casually . Black women took it the most casually of all . Whoopi in particular was eagerly defending Bill Clinton . <p> " Why , Whoopi ? " I asked her . " What do you see in him ? " <p> " He 's a friend to black folk , " she said , or words to that effect . <p> " How ? " I asked . " In what possible way ? " <p> " Well , he 's been good to us welfare mothers , " she said with a cheerful smile . <p> " You think of yourself as a welfare mother ? " I asked in amazement . <p> " Not entirely , " she said , " but I still know a lot of them . Clinton made their lives a lot easier . " <p> " Maybe Whoopi likes him because he liked her , " said one of the other guests with a clever wink . <p> " You 're not that far off , " Whoopi said with another clever wink . But , then , Whoopi is such a joker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got in a good lick when a question was asked about " What is an astronomical unit ? " The idea is to make up a gag answer and then to tell the real answer . My gag answer was , " An astronomical unit is the number of lies Bill Clinton tells in a week . " The audience loved it , and so did the performers . I am telling you , this guy is a joke . <p> For the first part of the show , I sat next to Al Roker , the weather man for the " Today " show . He 's truly funny and amazingly quick . I am sort of amazed that anyone could be that quick . He 's wasted doing the weather . He could do much more . In fact , he used to do a quite good game show at MSNBC . Thank heavens , their show was canceled . On the other hand , this show , this wickedly clever " Hollywood Squares , " is on right opposite " Win Ben Stein 's Money . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot funnier . Thursday <p> <p> A day of more or less total insanity . I awakened and wrote for a while ( I hope that part was not insane ) . Then I went over to see my acting agent about his hookup with a public speaking agent . The acting agent had been quite overweight , but had lost a ton of weight . That part also was not insane and in fact quite encouraging . <p> I like my acting agent , and I want him to be healthy . <p> Then , a short hike to a totally grungy building where the public speaking agent hangs out . It was a dismal suite with ancient shag carpeting , pitiful fiberboard partition walls , tiny , undersized furniture , and a bedraggled look . <p> " So , what kind of a show do you want to do ? " asked the public speaking agent . <p> " I do n't do a show , " I said . " I give talks about family values and appreciating your family and your life . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard me , the agent said he had a revue going in Lake Tahoe featuring tap dancing girls . Was there anything I could do to join in with that revue ? Any kind of visuals ? <p> " No , " I said again . " I give the occasional speech . No revues . No shows . " <p> " How about speaking to Intel ? " asked his colleague , a lovely young woman . " Would that be all right ? " <p> " Yes , that would be fine , " I said . Yeah , right . <p> I left that interview feeling old , beaten , broke , and pathetic . One picks up the aura of the people one is with . <p> Then , a chance meeting with the busty and beautiful but decidedly wacky Dotty . She wanted to know if she could move in with me . " My landlord is tossing me out , " she said . " He 's selling my unit . Can I come live with you ? " <p> " With my wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I do n't think so , " I said . <p> " Why not ? " <p> I told you it was an insane day . Thursday <p> <p> Here I am racing along the road from Dulles Airport to Washington , D.C. in my rented Buick Park Avenue . What a great , super car . Heavy . Luxurious . Smooth . Powerful . Great stereo . Great air conditioning . This is a Buick that rides like the great Buick Roadmasters of old . A Buick 's Buick . Far more comfortable than a Lexus . I like it . <p> My father was waiting for me , watching TV . Wow , does he love TV . Basketball , baseball , football , detective shows , mysteries , opera , ballet , anything but talk shows . That TV and a chair are the only furniture he needs . Plus , he seems to read about two books each day and write an article . How on earth does he do it ? <p> Speaking of TV , maybe it 's time for a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I start with its dilutive political effect . For example , Bill Clinton is a pure demagogue , although a good president on economic issues , largely because he turns them over to people who understand them . ( No , this does not mean I am about to follow David Brock in any way . ) But no one thinks of him as a spellbinder and there is no possibility that in any large way he could supersede the Constitution . There just is not much excitement about him one way or the other . That 's because we know him from TV . <p> In TV land , America , when we see something that 's interesting on TV , we watch it for a moment , then get up for a beer or potato chips , and then switch to the sexy exercise gals on ESPN . In many little families , no enthusiasm or fervor can be whipped up for anything . <p> Nothing takes much hold except very slowly in America , and that 's thanks to TV and the way it reaches us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got this notion from my smart father , and it makes a lot of sense . <p> Another good thing about TV is that it endlessly preaches tolerance . There is no such item in TV land as a racist show  --  except for racist depictions of black people often by black people . But these are shows where the black people talk loud , mock each other , act like KKK parodies of black people , by black people . It 's not allowed on TV for a white person to mock a black , and Jews are only mocked by themselves also . In TV land , unlike in real life , blacks and whites hang out together , drink beer together , socialize together . This is a template for a future , more mixed society , if people choose to have it . <p> On TV , no one ever hurts his kids , at least not for long . All family problems are solved out of love . No one beats a kid into submission and gets away with it . ( Although come to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wives may bicker but they always kiss and make up . <p> On TV , there is a lot of crime , but it 's always labeled as crime , and no one praises it as bold new initiatives in finance , the way some people praise financial shysters . <p> Plus , and here is probably the best thing about TV , TV elevates consumerism to a religion . That 's a good thing . There is probably nothing less harmful in life than getting and spending . A smart philosopher once said that no activity was more harmless than making money . ( Was it Samuel Johnson ? ) On TV , with its endless selling , Americans are diverted from more harmful pursuits into making money . <p> And then there is all that gasoline that 's saved as families and individuals stay home with their shows rather than go to the movies . <p> The only really bad part is that network TV has reached an all-time low of idiocy . But what the heck ? We have cable now , and shows for almost every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see me and we talked for a long time about age and the stock market and love and loss . Then to bed at the River Inn , my Washington terrarium . The staff all know me here , and it is a great thing to have friends when you travel . Sunday <p> <p> Brunch at the Cosmos Club in Washington , D.C. with my father and his pals Stanley and Rhoda Fischer . Stanley is a 54-year-old economist who is deputy head of the International Monetary Fund . His wife is a high official at George Washington University . She 's very pretty . He has responsibility for bailing out all of the poor countries whose currencies are such a mess . Since the advent of floating rates , the IMF 's mission has gotten somewhat cloudy . But I am not really an expert in this area , so I 'll just say something about Stanley and Rhoda . <p> Here they are , in positions of incredibly crucial authority . Stanley has a big hunk of all the responsibility , in the whole world on his shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps the scion of a powerful New York banking family ? No . He , like Rhoda , grew up in what was then Northern Rhodesia . Stanley 's family was in a tiny little town whose name I can not even pronounce . His father had emigrated from Latvia or maybe it was Lithuania , to be a small shopkeeper in this little town . His father then became mayor of that small town , surely a stunning comment on his abilities and self-confidence . ( His uncle became mayor of Salisbury or maybe it was Bulawayo . Some much bigger town . Obviously , self-confidence runs in the family . ) <p> Stanley 's town was so remote that it was three days ' train ride from Capetown even in the 1950 's . <p> How did he get to the mighty post he now holds ? By being a great student in high school , and then a great student at M.I.T. He is immensely self-effacing and never brags at all . But what a mind he must have and what self-discipline . I am totally impressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother 's grave . Those are sad trips . I am telling you : appreciate your parents when they 're still here . Make the most of your time with them . It 's serious . When they 're gone , there is no replacement . Tuesday <p> <p> Today I 'm heading back to L.A. My father and I had a dismayingly poor lunch at the Watergate Hotel , and then made turkey hot dogs in his apartment . Then I bid him a sad goodbye . He stood out on the corner of Virginia Avenue and New Hampshire in front of the Watergate and watched me drive away . I hate seeing my father recede in the rear-view mirror . <p> " Too much saying ' good-bye , ' " my mother used to say . <p> My flight to LAX was crowded indeed , considering that it is the first night of Yom Kippur . I have gotten to the point where I recognize quite a few of my fellow frequent-flying passengers in the cabin , and that 's nice . But what was not nice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back so far that his head was literally in my lap as if he were my dog and I were looking for fleas . I complained and he moved . But who designed the seats that way ? <p> I watched an amazingly pointless movie called The Truman Show . Jim Carrey , who was so great in Ace Ventura , is totally wasted here . I guess the movie is supposed to be about paranoia , and how paranoia is often justified . Or maybe it 's about how we all live in a world of totally manufactured reality . I imagine the Holocaust deniers would love The Truman Show . It 's a sort of blue skies , chirping birds version of their theories about history . <p> Speaking of which , I am reading an amazingly fine book called The Reason Why , by Cecil Woodham Smith , about the causes of the catastrophic Charge of the Light Brigade in the Crimea . The story of the aristocrats ' contempt for just basic good sense is terrifying . A large part covers the Irish Famine of the 1840 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lord of huge estates in County , Mayo . Sad , sad , heartbreakingly sad . <p> I am not even up to the Crimean War yet , but a great work of history is a great work indeed . Now that the stock market is carrying off all of my hopes for a lavish life , I will spend my declining years reading instead of playing polo or racing my yachts . <p> Off I drifted to dreamland , listening to the Eagles on my headphones when I was awakened by a loud sound of some fool shuffling cards . It was really , really loud . Plus , it went on and on and on . As if someone were shuffling hundreds of cards . Then the vile sound of cards being slapped into a neat pile . Where the hell is this coming from ? I ventured forth in the premium cabin to find the evil-doers . <p> The culprits were the usual suspects : namely , the stewardesses clustered in the kitchen . Six of them . Gathered around one plump flight attendant who was shuffling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell . <p> " What on earth is this ? " I asked . " What are you doing ? " <p> " We 're playing cards , " she said warily . <p> " Surely you are not supposed to be playing cards , " I said . " Plus , the noise is driving me insane . Anyway , what kind of game uses so many cards ? " <p> " The game is called Misery , " the plump one said , unsmilingly . <p> " Well , it 's time to stop waking me up , " I said . " If you have to play , do it quietly , please . " <p> The stewardesses all looked at me with surly anger . They mumbled about how they were sorry , but they did not seem at all sorry . In fact they looked as if they were going to poison me . <p> Where on earth do employees get the idea that their job is their playtime ? That the people who pay their salaries are hindrances and bothers ? There is a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . But what about the duties of employees ? <p> Anyway , when I got off the plane , what should I hear on the car radio but another stock market crash . How maddening . I was rich two months ago , and now what am I but another derelict loser ? I felt dizzy with fatigue and loss as I rode home . Loser , loser , loser , said my mind , my committee , my internal Vishinsky . <p> Ah , when I arrived home and opened the door there was my bleached-blond salvation , Tommy Stein , smiling like a jack-o ' - lantern , grinning madly , smiling like his face would split , and when he saw me he screamed , " DADDY ! " Wednesday <p> <p> Yom Kippur . Four in the afternoon . I am fasting . I am hungry . I am on my way to Yizkor services at out Temple , where the faithful pray for our departed dear ones . I miss my mother so fiercely that I talk to her all the time anyway , but here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It was a mob scene . I parked about a mile away and strolled to the synagogue , on a leafy residential part of Hollywood Boulevard . It was a swirling cauldron of praying , worried-looking fellow Jews . The first man I recognized was Marty Kaplan , former Mondale speechwriter , Hollywood screenwriter , and now high-level academic at USC . He greeted me affably . Then I ran into a psycho whom I will call " Harry . " In his insinuating , hostile way , he started to ask me about Judge Start and call him a bad guy . Harry always stands way too close to me and leans into me , and it makes me insane . " I am not here to debate about Clinton , " I said , " but Starr is my hero , and that 's an end to it . " <p> Then , another problem . No prayer books . They ran out . Not good . I am a substantial donor to the temple . How come I do n't get a book ? Probably too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walked around the lobby , looking for a prayer book . Aha ! There 's one on a radiator . I walked over and a woman with a thick Russian accent held out her hand and said , " Stop . That belongs to her ! " She pointed at a large black , yes , black woman who strolled over and said , " Hey , sugar , no problem . I 'll share it with you . " <p> No , thanks . It 's a time to have some solitude amidst the crowd . But I appreciated her offer . <p> I went to my lonely seat high in the balcony . Ooops . Behind me is a family of two parents and about six kids . Again , it 's Yom Kippur . A fasting day . The parents of this family are feeding the kids Fritos in the sanctuary . Yes ! On Yom Kippur . The noise of the cellophane and the smell and the chomping are driving me batty . <p> Then person after person passes by and just blithely talks to whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sermon about being with the people we love . <p> Then some male jerk with dreadlocks down to his knees passed in front of me and everyone nearby began to talk about him . Then the little kids started jumping on my row of seats , jolting me every time I began to pray . I ca n't take it . I want to think about God and my Mom , not about kids eating Fritos . <p> I walked the very long way uphill back to my car . At home , I took out an ancient prayer book for the Day of Atonement . Leather bound . Given to me by my long-departed Uncle Hy . I prayed for forgiveness for sins of obduracy , pride , greed , stiff-neckedness , lust , deceit , adultery , meanness of spirit , harsh words , and hundreds more over and over again . Then , I said the Kaddish for my Mom , and then it was time to eat . I pray more or less nonstop , so this day was about not eating , and I guess that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . <p> Tommy , Alex , and I went to Morton 's and ate a quiet meal in the quiet room . Tommy was being very , very cute . " I want to have Dana take me to soccer , " he said , " because Daddy is too crabby and too controlling . " <p> He thinks I am controlling ! Me , the world 's biggest patsy for his seams and schemes ? ? ? Wow , is he in for some shocks . I ca n't wait to see who he marries . <p> " I do n't want to wear glasses any longer , " he said . " They make me look nerdy . " <p> " Too bad , " I said . " The doctor says you have to wear them . " <p> " But they make me look like a nerd , " he repeated . <p> " Tommy , as you can clearly see , both Mommy and Daddy wear glasses , " I said blithely . <p> " I rest my case , " says little Blackstone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat . Then he made one for the kitty , Peabo , and then back to sleep . Only I could not sleep because I am thinking of the stock market and the big new house we are buying , and I am scared . <p> Money has always been a frightening subject for me . It has a particularly dense gravity in my life . My grandparents were terrified about money . My mother was terrified about money . I have always been terrified about money , but I fight against it and try to act as if spending it or losing it did not bother me . In fact , the whole subject can electrify me with fear , even over small things like a dinner tab . <p> While the stock market was racing upward , shooting off great showers of paper profits , I had a unique , once-in-a-lifetime feeling of safety and security . Now , that 's ancient history . Those great days of wondering what kind of speakers to buy for my stereo , what new kind of disc player I should have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blithe and silly concerns were my day . I felt as if I had zero weight . I could do anything . I could fly , all thanks to the ever charging market , a miraculous deity that said I was rich when I should have known it was teasing me . <p> Now , it 's wake-up time . I feel sick every day when I read the reports on AOL about the market . My losses have reached staggering levels . <p> And , again , my wifie and I are buying a house next week . A " grown-up house , " as my wife calls it . A house in a neighborhood of all rich people except for us . It 's scaring me so much I can hardly think straight . <p> A house is a big responsibility . " Oh , you ca n't lose money on a house in Beverly Hills , " say my friends . " Oh , we deserve it , " says my wife . <p> Maybe so , but then why am I so scared ? When I drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in poverty because we lost all of our savings on that house in Beverly Hills . I can already see the sheriff posting the foreclosure notice on the door . I eau see our little family living in a trailer out by the Salton Sea with a lifetime of work sunk into that house in the fiats of Beverly Hills . I am telling you , it 's terrifying . A big mortgage is stone solid terror . My shrink pal Gartho often tells me that a big mortgage is one of the number one stressors in life . He should certainly know : he has a multi-million dollar house in Palm Beach , another one in St. John 's Wood , and a lush condo in Manhattan . <p> Long ago , my old girlfriend Pat talked me into buying a house in Wesley Heights in Washington . I was terrified about it all the time . Come to think of it , in a way that house is like the one we 're about to buy : the cheapest house in a very snooty neighborhood . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the one in Wesley Heights cost , and I assure you I do not make anywhere near thirty times as much as I did then . I used to sit at my little desk at the Old Executive Office Building going over and over whether I could afford the mortgage . Then , right after I bought it , my boss lost his job and so did I. I sold it at a slight gain a couple of years later . Recently , it sold for seven times what I paid for it . There is a lesson there . But what is it ? Thursday <p> <p> Fear . Terror . Waking me up . Fear to turn on CNBC and see the stock market prices . Fear to look at the escrow papers . Should I take a pill ? Take a sip of cough syrup ? Or , should I pray ? <p> I decided to read my books on serenity : " It does not matter if our backs are against the wall . God is our wall . " " If you truly surrender to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in peace . " " You can not be a loser or someone who does not count , because to God , you count , and that 's the only counting that matters . " " My only job today is to do what 's in front of me , trust God , not hurt anyone including myself , and go on . " " Relax . God is in charge . " " If my relationship with God is right , nothing else in my life is of great consequence . " " Just for today , I will take a vacation from fear . " <p> These words and these thoughts , little by little , offer peace . I watched the morning news , and then in a serenity frame of mind , I wrote this letter : <p> Honorable Bill C. The White House Washington , D.C. <p> Dear Bill C. , <p> I notice that you have apparently become a member of a 12-step group since your recent problems with the law . You have talked about " turning your problem over to God , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " out of your hands , " and you even made a small gesture of making amends to Monica L. , which is also a part of the 12-step program . <p> Frankly , from the first minute you appeared on the national scene , you had a lot of the Program about you , talking about being the victim all of the time , sharing your feelings , biting your lip in pain and self-chastisement . That whopper you told about standing up to your alcoholic stepfather and threatening to hit him if he abused your mother when you were 15 is straight out of a dozen " pitches " I have heard in church basements . <p> In fact , I went for years to a meeting in Malibu , where I suspect you will soon live , and maybe I 'll see you making the coffee or stacking the chairs at the meeting very soon , and do n't forget we are self-sufficient through our own contributions so do n't expect anyone else to throw in that dollar for you . <p> Now , Bill , step four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own shortcomings , and I would not dream of taking your inventory . I have plenty of my own problems , or issues , as we say here . But I think you might be a little bit unfamiliar yet with how the Program works . <p> For example , when we admit we are powerless over our problem , whether it 's alcohol , or drugs , or sex ( and I am not laughing at you  --  I 've been there ) or dishonest ) , ( a literal addiction to lying ) , soon thereafter we are supposed to make a list of all people we have harmed ( step 8 ) , become willing to make amends to all of them ( also step 8 ) , and then to make amends to them all , directly wherever possible ( step 9 ) . <p> Now , Bill , admitting you did wrong , but then having your army of goons start an unprecedented smear campaign against the man who brought you to your knees before God is not usually thought of as asking forgiveness and making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to these program rooms by the judge , we do n't come here and act holy  --  and then put our friends on TV saying the judge is a repressed sex criminal and a danger to the state . The Program only works if you really do show evidence of making amends  --  and crucifying the people who pointed out that you were powerless over lying or sex is not a form of making amends . For a member of the Program to ask his friends to deny in the well of Congress that he in fact had a problem while he is also turning over his powerlessness before that problem to God is not consistent with Step 6 : becoming entirely ready to have God remove our shortcomings . <p> Bill , there 's a saying in the Program . If we do n't get to our knees , we 're going to be knocked to our knees by our addiction . You have been knocked to your knees , all right , but you are not staying on your knees . You 're trying to stand up and lash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Program is about humility , surrender , service , prayer , and making amends . You ca n't have it both ways . You ca n't proclaim a life of humility  --  and then use the power of your position to elevate yourself to moral superiority over those who caught you . Otherwise you are not admitting your powerlessness , not admitting your faults , not making amends , and in fact are still " out there " doing what got you here in the first place . <p> The Program has power , Bill . It can make you well and give you peace . But you have to Walk the Walk , not just Talk the Talk . Call off your attack dogs , Bill . Apologize to Judge Start for what you and Mr. Carville have called him . Make a full confession , if only to your sponsor , and make it right to the real people you have harmed  --  the whole American nation , by lying and soiling your office  --  by leaving the office for which you are clearly incapacitated . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than you ever dreamed possible . You will trudge the road of happy destiny with people a lot like you who really did surrender , really did make amends , and really did become healed , day by day , dependent on a temporary reprieve from God . <p> Try , it , Bill . It works if you work it . Monday <p> <p> I got a call from a British friend today . " Is this going to be the same as Watergate ? " he asked . <p> " Yes , it will be exactly the same as Watergate . In Watergate , the media establishment kicked out the guy they did n't like and spit in the face of the law . In Clintonismo , the media establishment will keep in power the guy they like and will spit in the face of the law . Both will be examples of the amazing power of an unelected media elite . " <p> He 's a kindly English guy , so he agreed . <p> Then a call from my pal John . " Have you seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's fried his brain and left him insane ? What do you think ? " <p> " It 's possible , " I said . " After all , he resists shame , resists normal human responses , so maybe he 's drugged on powerful anti-depressants or amphetamines . The people I know who are truly unable to respond to normal moral constraints are often on drugs . " <p> But when I told this hypothesis to my wife , she made a brilliant observation . " He 's too crazy , " she said . " It goes beyond drugs . " <p> ILLUSTRATION ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By Benjamin J. Stein <p> <p> BENJAMIN J.
