 | most inoffensive words in which to couch the unpleasantness . " There has never before been a case of a consort being examined when the mortal mother was yet living and retained memory of her child . " Ylfcwen 's face was as seamless as a mirror . Her enormous eyes studied the director as though he were a moth found among her precious silks . She was assessing the potential damage . At last she said only , " I am not unfamiliar with the particulars of the case . " The goblin sent to replace the human child had not " taken . " When discovered , the changeling had not been exposed to the elements , but named and , worse , loved . " I suppose you want me in a room somewhere , to sign things .

But , as it happens , the terms of his indenture expire when he turns seven years and seven hours old . We have looked over the regulations most carefully and have found a most fortunate exception . He may begin the exam while he is six , so long as he turns seven years old before he finishes it . It is possible for him to be examined a few hours before his indenture ends ; in that case , he then forfeits his birthright to return Above . Of course , it will not be put to him that way . " The director of the Royal Household Agency cleared his throat . " If madam will sign . . . " Ylfcwen paid him no heed . She was remembering her son on his seventh birthday . Nothing had been spared in the lavish preparations and gifts , the most fantastic of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came for him to make a wish over the cinder cake before it was cast into the fire ,  | the boy was nowhere to be found . He turned up at last under a couch , playing with a wooden top a goblin nurse had given him . Vervain waited until Pending was twenty minutes late before dispatching servants to find him and remind him of the drawing lesson . The search proved futile . Morag reported the boy had bolted his lunch and beat from the room like a bat from Above . " Boys will be boys , " she said , biting off a thread from her mending , " even if they are Consorts-in-Waiting . " Vervain swallowed her chagrin . " Well , he 's nowhere to be found . For all anyone can tell , he 's turned into a mole and disappeared down a tunnel . " She was not far wrong . It had all started several months earlier with a game of hide-and-go-seek . His goblin whipping boy , Tomus , had been the seeker and , even with the consort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found him six times running . Determined not to be found again , Pending had hidden himself in one of the old dumbwaiters left over from another regime when , afraid of being poisoned , the queen of the time had dinner laid in dozens of decoy dining rooms to outwit the Pretender of her day . He had been congratulating himself on his latest hiding place when the dumbwaiter began a rapid descent , plummeting past all the inhabited levels of the palace , past unseen basement storerooms and armories and kennels , so that he thought he must be moving toward the very middle of the world itself . This , everyone knew , was filled with the Ether of Life and molten gold . The boy bit his lip and prepared to be gilded alive . The dumbwaiter had come to a rusty halt , and someone on the other side  --  some creature of the ethereal interior , impervious  | to the temperature of molten gold  --  had cursed the dumbwaiter doors while trying to open them . When they opened at last , the boy looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recovering from his own astonishment , the goblin yelled to the others . " That Alma ! Come look at what she 's sent for our supper ! If it is n't the Consort Pending 's whipping boy ! " The tallest of the other miners came over . " Whipping boy , nothing . That 's the Consort Pending himself . No mistaking Vervain 's handiwork . " He threw back his head and laughed . " And he 's sat on Alma 's best pie . " That was how he first met Ethold . At the miners ' insistence , he had joined them in a lunch of flattened mole pie . Contrary to Ylfcwen 's suspicions , the miners ate food from the queen 's own larders , prepared in the palace kitchens by the queen 's own second sauce cook , a goblin lass by the name of Alma . Hours later , after singing many goblin songs whose words were cleaned up for his benefit , and drinking much strong tea with a slug of rootwine in it , he had tiptoed through the palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put Tomus to bed in his place so that Vervain would not guess he was gone . " Pending , I wo n't give you Tomus 's whipping , but you do deserve it , you know you do ! They 'd flay me alive for speaking to you so , but mercy , someone has to tell you . If Vervain had discovered Tomus , do you have any idea what would have happened to him ? " And she had fed him Tomus 's dinner , and put him to bed on Tomus 's pallet , and Vervain was never the wiser . This day , while Vervain waited for him in the orchid nursery , Pending found the miners engrossed in a game of cat 's eye , a drinking game played with somersault tumblers . Instead of a pedestal , these tumblers ended in a metal cage that enclosed a pair of dice . When the glass was filled the player emptied it in  | a swallow and set the glass upside down in front of him , the dice scaled in the cage showed a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt losing , accused another of having weighted his glass so that the dice always came up elevens . A fight seemed about to break out . Ethold looked up and caught the boy 's eye . " That 's enough , boys . Here , Pinch , take over my hand . " With that he got up and came over to Pending . " Well , it 's been some time since you 've paid a visit . Vervain must have been holding your nose to the whetstone . " Ethold put out a hand and felt the boy 's nose . " Yes , it 's noticeably sharper . " Then he felt the back of the boy 's head . " She is cramming you full of wisdom . Here , feel it yourself . " Pending laughed and knocked Ethold 's hand away . " Not so crammed as all that ! " He related his problems with the Goblin Pretenders . " Just remember , That Which Is Required Is Forbidden , " Ethold said . At the boy 's blank look , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a memory device : Each word begins with the first letter of one of the goblin kings , in order from the first king to the last . " A light dawned and Pending broke into a grin . " Tabardyr , Waerleg , Irlkin , Roleg , Ivo , Fustaugh ! " " Ah , we 'll make a goblin of you yet ! " muttered Ethold under his breath . " But , Ethold ? " " Yes , Pending ? " " You called them kings , but Vervain calls them the Goblin Pretenders . Who is right ? " Ethold shook his head . " For as long as anyone can remember , the elvish queens have been fighting the goblin kings . " " What are they fighting about ? " " It 's very complicated , Pending . The elvish queens say they have ever and always been fighting to defend the throne , while  | the goblins claim only to be fighting for their freedom . But listen : When you are with Vervain or anyone else from the palace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , understand ? Much hangs on your learning that lesson . " Ethold waited at the appointed place . The person he was meeting was late . It would have been nice to have a pipe while he waited , but he could not chance it . The queen 's spies were everywhere , and clove smoke was a giveaway . No one in Ylfcwen 's court would smoke anything so goblin . So Ethold stood in the half-light of a dimmed miner 's torch and waited . If he had so desired , Ethold might have lived at court with all the rank and privilege due a noble , even one of goblin blood . Ethold could pass for a full elf : he was uncommonly tall and lithe , lacking the florid complexion and stocky build of most goblins . His complexion had , in the poetic phrase of the court , " the kiss of the pomegranate " with none of its stain . His eyes , catlike only in their slant and intensity , were a mutable violet . Like all goblins , he possessed great physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities made him a formidable opponent at wrestling and chess  --  and war . Ethold had been at war with the queen for eleven years . To mention his name at court was an offense punishable by banishment , he had gone over to the side of the Goblin Pretender . At some point , one of them must falter and bring the confrontation to an end . But it would not be soon ; a similar blood feud several dynasties back had lasted nearly two centuries . There was plenty of time for Ethold and his followers to lard the queen 's treasuries with counterfeit gems and set cave-ins at certain key tunnels in the gemfields . The rebels had allies within the palace itself . It was such a one that he awaited now , in the hour before the lighting of the daylamps . The darkness of the tunnel gave up the form of a woman .  | They greeted one another with the secret sign of their cause . Even when safely in the shadows , she did not push back the hood of her cloak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darted a glance down the tunnel behind her . " Followed ? " " No , I am almost certain I was not . But suspected , yes . " " Have they any proof ? " No , but you and I both know that with Ylfcwen , suspicion is as good as fact  --  or better . Ethold . . . I have been thinking . I had better not come anymore . " His laugh was full of affection . " You 've been thinking too hard . " Her voice shook and she tried to steady it , speaking clear and low . " No , hear me ! Someone else could serve in my place . The risk is too great ? " " And you are too valuable to us . " He slipped his hands inside the hood on either side of her face . " And you 're quite indispensable to me . " It was an uncomradely kiss . She turned her head and mumbled into his shoulder . " I should go . They will miss me . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amethyst in the dark . " Before you make me forget , here 's this . " She drew a linenbound notebook from her cloak . He slipped the notebook inside his shirt . " You 're right about one thing , sweet . We 'll have to be more careful . We 'll change the place and time we meet . I wo n't send word to you for a while , for safety 's sake . In the meantime , my thoughts are with you . " " And mine with you . " She took a different tunnel , slipping back into the darkness . She did not look back , and soon had disappeared from his sight . When he was safe in his bunk in the miners ' barracks , Ethold drew out the notebook . It was full of elvish runes in a child 's hand  --  not any child 's hand , but the schoolboy script of the  | Consort Pending himself . Handwriting exercises , nonsense sentences , maxims of an arcane schoolroom etiquette . The boy had struggled to shape the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The assignment had been constructed to force the boy to work on the most troublesome characters : ? Crimp the crusts and cut the crinkled cakes . ? Weave wet willow wands for weary wasps . ? Quiz the queen about the quick , queer quest . ? Bury the busy , bright blossoms , bumblebee . . Ethold took out a small wheel fashioned from two circles of stiff paper , one large and one small , pinned together in the middle . A crescent-shaped window had been cut in the smaller circle . He turned the wheel so that a certain number showed through the window . Now , each goblin rune on the outer wheel was aligned with an elvish rune on the inner one . Ethold glanced at the first page of the notebook , then at the wheel , and began to fill a blank sheet of paper . The palace is busy with preparations for the examination of the Consort . Ylfcwen has commanded the Mistress of the Stones and the Woman of the Rings to lay out all the royal jewels so that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation for the ceremony . In addition , the queen has sent a servant Above to engage a tailor to make the examination suit for the Consort Pending . This presents us with an excellent opportunity to strike . . . .  | The dressmaker 's apprentice rarely dreamed anymore of her former life among the wolves . At first , the memories had padded tirelessly after her . Not the recent past , with the circus troupe , or even the years at court before that , but her very earliest recollections  --  of the den , the warm , solid body of the old she-wolf , her first sight of winter trees silvered by an ice storm . Seven years since , Ulfra had left Folderol 's troupe and settled in Moorsedge , coming to live with Tansy over the dressmaker 's shop at the sign of the Cat 's Face , named for the curious appearance of its owner , a former attraction with the same circus . She had been the leopard-woman , and her countenance had about it all that the name implied : Coarse black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , flat nose , which was white and  | pink . Her prominent upper jaw formed a kind of muzzle ; because of it she spoke with a soft lisp . " All I lack to make the illusion complete are whiskers and a tail , " she once told Ulfra , " and that old rogue Folderol tried to make me put them on , too . " Ulfra came to her new living at the age of twelve , more than a little rough around the edges . Before she could be entrusted with the shears or the heavy tailor 's iron called a goose , Ulfra had to master the rudiments of acceptable behavior . Tansy taught her apprentice not to take meat from the spit before it had been carved at table , not to bare her teeth whenever a strange man came into the room , and , most difficult of all , to submit as meekly as she could to the indignities of soap and hot water , and the hated hair comb and nailbrush . None of these things had come easily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the premises , and before she learned the rules of the house , Tansy would come down to supper to find the joint had been divided among Ulfra and the neighborhood dogs . Ulfra was now nearly twenty-one . Looking at her , with her hair smoothed back , dressed in her spotless blue smock , few guessed her strange beginnings . But even now , when being introduced to a stranger , she pressed her lips together to suppress a wolfish grimace . Tansy and Ulfra 's conversation had about it an understated affection not found in many families , let alone between master and apprentice . Ulfra had a bedchamber of her own tucked up beneath the eaves . When her work was done she had the run of the house until Tansy called her to supper by the fire in their common sitting room . The leopard-woman took delight in being read to , many an evening in bitter weather Ulfra would oblige , with a traveler 's tale , if it were a book of her choosing , or something with a good heroine , if Tansy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heavy walking stick and Ulfra would fetch their cloaks and they would walk  | along the lamplit streets and out of town , far enough down the road for the darkness to close in and show them the teeming stars . Sometimes on these walks Ulfra 's contentment would swell without warning into the keenest joy . Afterward she would crawl late to bed and sleep a bottomless sleep . If she dreamed a dream , wolves figured in it not at all . Tnsy 's old friend and confidante Lady Twixtwain came one evening to sup with them in their rooms above the Cat 's Face . Ulfra helped her out of her cloak and hat . Lady Twixtwain 's person was very large and exquisitely dressed , her humor unfailingly good , her tongue and wits sharp , her face reckoned among the two or three most beautiful in the thirteen kingdoms . " Ulfra , my sweet , will you kindly take Opaline along to the kitchen for her tisane ? " Have a peek at dinner , too , will you ? " said Tansy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up . " Opaline was Lady Twixtwain 's aging and adored greyhound , who carried around her neck a purse containing her mistress 's smelling salts and snuff , rouge and brandy . Ulfra unbuckled the purse and led the dog to the kitchen , where a bowl of chamomile steeped in milk was keeping warm . Lady Twixtwain watched Ulfra go . When she was out of earshot , her ladyship began to peel the snowy kid gloves from her hands . " She is much improved , my dear , very much improved . I commend you . " Tansy protested . " I have only tried to show her the advantages of mastering a craft and of sharpening the mind . " Lady Twixtwain considered this , her head tipped to one side . " In some cases , the only way to accomplish one 's end is through a slow bringing along . But really , Tansy , you have suc-  | ceeded admirably . She is lovely and natural without being at all false or coarse . " " I should hope she is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . That she is and will always be , have no fear of that . " Tansy shook her head . " I am afraid this is a hermitish life for a young woman . I go out so little , myself ; my friends come to me . Our circle is small  --  outside of our patrons and one or two servants , I am her sole companion . It 's a pity she should spend her youth making gowns for the daughters of merchants and councilmen without enjoying the same advantages . Though , to tell the truth , she never seems to envy them . She might be nine , not twenty , for all the interest she shows in the opposite sex . " Lady Twixtwain nodded thoughtfully . " Perhaps she is a win-ter 's rose and will blossom when all hope of it has been given up . It 's only natural , considering what her life had been . Think how much further she had to come than most young girls . When she does lose her heart , I think it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to everything . " " I hope you 're right . " The leopard-woman rose and went to the fire , taking and lighting a taper from the mantelpiece . She touched the taper to the wicks of the tall candles in the center of a card table laid for three . " I ca n't abide the thought of her breaking her heart , " she said , shaking her head . " After all , I stripped away all the wildness that protected her . I made it possible for her to be terribly wounded . " Lady Twixtwain smiled . " But how else is love possible ? " Tansy rose and went to the hearth , where three plates were keeping warm . Wrapping her hand in the folds of her skirt , she transferred the hot plates to the table . " May I tell you some-thing ? " " You mean , will I keep a secret ? " Lady Twixtwain heaved a sigh . " It goes against my grain , but I shall . "  | Tansy first went and listened at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opaline 's happy yelp . Taking her seat again , the leopard-woman began her tale . " It was market day a few weeks past . We went out walking . I had bought her a hat , her first . Though she protested fiercely at the expense , I could tell she was quite pleased . It was very becoming , but with it on , she suddenly became unlike herself ? coy and giddy . " Well , we stopped at a stall where a farm woman was selling her wares . Ulfra said she was sick of partridge , why did n't we have sausages . It was a joke : Actually , business had been slower than usual , and we 'd been dining on nothing but beans for a month . I began to barter with the woman and Ulfra asked the boy about the jam . " " Wait . Whose boy ? " " The farm woman 's son , I supposed . I only glanced over for a second . I was wearing my veil , but I could still see him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brown as a nut , with strange , white hair . " " Wait . My feeble brain begins to stir . Was n't there a mute with her in the circus ? An albino , if my memory serves me ? " Tansy nodded . " Though , from what Ulfra has told me , he was neither mute nor albino . His name was Nix . And that is all she has told me of him in seven years . " " Did she speak to him ? " " Only what she had to , to buy the jam . It was plain to me she knew him . His face was a terrible thing to see . She smiled and thanked him , he handed her the jam ; we left . And do you know , she has n't worn the hat since , nor will she touch the jam . We never speak of it . " " Small seams , " Lady Twixtwain said under her breath . This was a signal used by tailors to mean : The person you are talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the saltcellar.  | Ulfra entered the room carrying the supper on a tray . Lady Twixtwain smiled . " You had better hold that tray a little higher , or Opaline will have those chops out from under your nose . " Ulfra awakened the following morning to find Opaline asleep at the foot of her bed . When the game of spoilfive ran on after dinner , the old dog would follow Ulfra up to bed and nap until Lady Twixtwain went home . The game must have gone on very late indeed . Opaline opened her eyes , licked Ulfra 's hand , and yawned . Watching her made Ulfra yawn , too , and she laughed . " Good morning , " she said , scratching the dog behind the ears . Opaline beat her tail on the coverlet politely , but her plaintive look said , It is past my breakfast time . They padded downstairs together , where they found plum cake and hot wine keeping warm , and a note from Tansy . Hope you both slept well . Opaline looked so sweet we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've taken the court gowns to Lady Alders in Blackswan Street for the final fitting . Please pick up the order at the button maker and then drop Opaline off at Lady T. 's  --  she has gone to the baths for the rest of the morning to lick her wounds . ( Hal ) Ulfra smiled ; Lady Twixtwain always retreated to the public baths when Tansy had beaten her badly at cards . They went out into the street . Moorsedge had been in decline for many years , a rough town on the border of the downs . Then one year the king 's only son had come to hunt and stayed . He had reopened the long-closed palace built by an earlier king as a refuge for his queen during a drawn-out civil war . The prince 's set had flocked to Moorsedge , and the merchants had followed  | them . Biding his time until the crown should be his , the prince Indulged his tastes for the theater and other amusements . It was the last market day before a holiday , and the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles and corks , melons , sausages , ribbons , flour , copper saucepans , cheeses , and hothouse grapes . One could have scissors sharpened , chickens plucked , boots mended , teeth pulled , keys made , curses removed . The air was filled with the fragrant steam and smoke from a stall where you could buy a paper cone filled with tiny , sweet crabs , dipped in batter and fried whole . Ulfra had to drag Opaline away from the crab stall , where the dog was in danger of being nipped on the nose . They made their way to the button maker 's , where Ulfra picked up the parcel . When that account was settled , she went from case to case in the tiny shop , looking for some buttons for the bodice she was making as a surprise for Tansy . At last she bought some of jet and amber in the shape of bees . She had spent more time deciding on her buttons than she meant and hurried through the streets , with Opaline casting anxious looks up at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hurry . As they turned into Lady Twixtwain 's street , Opaline pulled up short , so frantic with fear that she tried to clamber up into Ulfra 's arms . In the cobbled yard , a slight , weasely man was baiting a wolf . If the wolf had not been muzzled and hobbled , it would not have been much of a match . A crowd of well-dressed onlookers watched from balconies and doorways , drinking wine and cheering the man on . The wolf was too spent to resist as the man poked it in the ribs with a sharp stick . It lay glaring up at its tormentor . Then it caught sight of Ulfra and began a strange , high keening , a mingled greeting and plea . Ulfra rushed up and struck the stick from the man 's hand . The crowd roared . Scarlet with anger , the man grabbed her  | shoulder . She seized his thumb smartly and bent it backward so that he shrieked and let her go . Ulfra knelt by the wolf and started to loosen the hobble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouts faded quickly to a nervous murmuring . The courtyard quickly emptied , echoing with the clatter of many doors and shutters being fastened at once . The animal was but half-grown , rope-sore and frightened , but Ulfra found no open wounds . She ran her hands over the wolf to reassure it , speaking to it low in her throat , in the whines and growls of wolf speech . Keeping a safe distance , the man clutched his thumb and protested . " That 's our wolf . There 's a gold bounty on it ! It 's as good as stealing , what you 're doing ! My master will have you flogged for thievery  --  and for breaking my thumb ! " " Be careful what you say , William , " said a new voice . " She looks capable of doing a little flogging herself . " Ulfra turned to see the newcomer . In the doorway of the inn stood a man of blunt , bearlike features and build , with a weather-roughened face above a grizzled beard . He held a goblet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin , draped incongruously over the iron-studded leather breastplate of a professional hunter . He was , in fact , the king 's own huntsman . Seeing her there , her ice blue eyes the match of the wolf 's , the animal calm and trusting in her arms , he was not about to tell her so . " She 's broken my thumb , " the first man complained again . " It 's the least you deserved , " Ulfra snapped . " Yes , William , it is the least you deserved . Never tease a wolf . You had no way of telling if the muzzle would hold . " Ulfra stared blue daggers at him . " Is that his wrongdoing ? Carelessness , and not cruelty ? " " Madam , that is my wolf . I intend to collect the bounty on it , in the name of the king . If you have some argument with that , then come with me , and we shall let the king decide the matter . "  | The huntsman smiled and held out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its throat . Ulfra spoke to it in wolf speech , the animal flattened its ears in submission . " This is a Direwolf , " Ulfra said . " It is untouchable under the king 's or any other law . If you harm it , you will answer to the ) irewolves . " The huntsman frowned and considered . He had eaten a large meal , he wanted to finish his wine and have a pipe and a nap . I le did not want to stand here arguing with a wolf-eyed girl . " It is asking me to let it go so that it can kill you , " she added . " It says you killed its mother with a trap . " " Tell it , " he replied , carefully biting off each word , " that its mother and her kind have been killing the king 's deer . " It is the wolves ' wood and their deer . " He saw that she would not be moved . " Take it . Take it back to the damned wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it again , I will skin it myself on the spot . " Ulfra nodded , coaxed Opaline from her hiding place under a stairway , and left , carrying the wolf in her arms . The huntsman watched her go . " William , never interrupt my meal in this manner again , " he said , and went back in to his repast . But his venison had lost its savor , and his hand , when he reached for the wine , trembled . One spectator had not fled when Ulfra untied the wolf . He stood now as he had when the scene first unfolded , leaning against a rainspout in rumpled clothes the color of earth , a strange green hat perched on his head . He waited until the huntsman and his kennel master had left . Then the odd spectator bent and retrieved something from the ground , a parcel no bigger than a loaf of bread : the buttons , forgotten in the scuffle . The parcel was labeled in ink : ? T. Panter , Dressmaker ? At the sign of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heavens ! " Tansy stood in the doorway to the sitting room and gazed in dismay at the scene before her . A half-grown wolf lay on the sofa , its paws bandaged , taking bits of raw liver from Ulfra 's hand . " It 's all right , " said Ulfra . " I 've put down a cloth to catch anything he drops . " " Oh , Ulfra ! " " He 's not strong enough to travel . He would never make it back to the wood on his own . " " Oh , my . " Tansy ventured into the room and gingerly took a seat . " But who will take him there ? No  --  you can not think of going . " Ulfra shook her head . " I wo n't need to . When he is well , the others will come for him . " Tansy stared . The wolf stared back , then rested its head on the sofa cushion and grinned at her , tongue lolling . " All right , " she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house . And I think it best that our customers do not make his acquaintance . " The next day there came to the Cat 's Face an odd customer . They were in the workroom when the bell rang , Ulfra set down the hissing iron goose and went into the outer room . The person on the other side of the counter was remarkable even by the standards of the Cat 's Face , a man of birdlike slightness and grace , dressed all in brown . He held in one hand a hat of ivy green . His face was outwardly stoic , with the merest hint of mirth about the eyes . These Ulfra took at first to be blue , but then realized that they were in fact silver and were only casting back the color of her work smock . " May I be of some service ? " " I require a suit of clothes for a boy of not quite seven years . "  | The silver eyes roamed over the room , changing hue as they settled on various garments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth of gold before turning on Ulfra a gaze as full of liquid fire as a cat 's . " I am prepared to pay handsomely . " One birdlike hand disappeared into a pocket and reappeared with a purse . Five-sided silver coins spilled onto the counter with a musical clatter . It was a currency unfamiliar to Ulfra , but in her circus days she had learned never to turn up her nose at other people 's money . " For such a sum you could have something handsome indeed . What is the occasion ? " " An examination . " Ulfra thought that odd , but held her tongue . She knew there was nothing of the kind in stock , among all their youngest patrons , there were no boys of seven . Then she remembered a commission recently completed for an old friend from Tansy 's circus days . Ulfra fetched the suit and slipped it onto the smallest wooden form in the shop . She did not mention that it had been made for a dwarf . It was black velvet , faced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So heavy ! " marveled the stranger . " Yes . There are over one hundred pearls on it . Will something like this do ? " The odd customer smiled . " Something like it will answer our requirements most admirably . " Ulfra reached to get the heavy pattern register down from the shelf behind her . When she turned back to the counter she was alone , and the suit had vanished . Ulfra returned to the workroom and took up the hissing goose . " Who was it ? " Tansy asked . Ulfra started to say " A thief , " but heard herself say instead , " The strangest person . "  | That night Ulfra was roused from sleep by a loud rapping noise . She lay in bed , breathing as though still asleep , listening intently . The sound seemed to be coming from the heavy , dark wardrobe on the other side of the room . Easing off the blankets , Ulfra rolled out of bed , landing softly on the floor . Still in a crouch , she crept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neglected corner of the workroom until recently , when Tansy had decided Ulfra required a wardrobe of her own . They had aired it out and rubbed it with beeswax and lemon oil and hired six strong men to haul it upstairs . It was extremely heavy and very old  --  here and there the intricate carvings had been worn smooth , and the wood was black with age . As she reached out to touch it , the knocking suddenly ceased . Ulfra stood staring at the heavy doors of the wardrobe , a prickling at the back of her neck keeping her from flinging them wide . " Open , please , " said a voice , muffled by wool and silk and damask . Fear gave way to indignation . Ulfra threw open the doors with a bang . Inside , standing among her clothes , was the odd customer from the shop . His mousy suit had been replaced by a magnificant costume of white silk . He bowed low , the sleeves of his blue and silver overrobe sweeping the ground . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the court Below , " said he . " Will you come of your own free will ? " Ulfra laughed . " I should be very surprised if the back of my wardrobe was the way to the court of the elves . Tell me , when did you manage to hide in there ? And why did you steal the suit ? " He smiled . " The suit will be returned . It is because it so pleased the queen that your services have been engaged . Will you come of your own free will ? " The tone of his voice and the cool gleam of his quicksilver  | eyes were together so compelling that Ulfra found herself nodding . In a wink he had seized her hand and was drawing her into the wardrobe . What had always been a solid panel at the back of the wardrobe had become a brick wall set with a small door . The messenger in blue and silver opened it and helped Ulfra down a narrow staircase . They passed into a clean and spacious tunnel lit with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapestries , surpassing in skill any Ulfra had seen , even at court . The messenger led Ulfra to a room where elvish handmaidens gave her a silk coat with trailing sleeves to slip over her muslin nightdress . Returned to the custody of the messenger , she was led finally into a chamber that held a strange group of personages . In the center , seated in a chair that was very grand yet not quite a throne , was an elf woman of extraordinary beauty . Her opal eyes betrayed both boredom with the situation and the hope that it might yet prove in some small part diverting . She held in her lap a small , furry creature , which Ulfra at first took for a rabbit , then saw was a mole . To the queen 's right stood an elvish woman whose bearing and clothing bespoke a position more of merit than birth . A close handmaiden or , more likely , a governess . Ulfra thought she was anxious , hiding something . Guilt , or fear . At the queen 's other hand stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed a mask . Even his eyes were unreal , and they kept a sort of loathsome watchfulness , as a carrion crow keeps on a flock . Nastily keen for opportunity  --  that was it . Ulfra disliked him . By far the most compelling person in the room was the boy seated at the feet of the queen . He sat on a small miniature of the queen 's chair , and the queen 's hand rested on his shoulder with the same lazy air of possession with which she petted the mole . To judge by his face , he was no more than six , dressed after  | the elvish custom in many underrobes of sheer silk and an overrobe of heavy damask . This outermost robe was deep blue , embroidered in silver thread with a pattern of fireflies and lamps . For want of sun , his skin had grown almost as translucent as that of the queen . His legs seemed too long for the rest of him , as though enforced inactivity had thwarted a natural sturdiness of limb . He stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as mere gazing and not succeeding . The stare from his odd , amber-colored eyes was the only warm thing in the room . The lean man took a step forward and read rapidly from a parchment . Then a set of papers was passed to the queen , who added her signature and seal . Once the wax was cool , the man nodded to the governess , who relieved the boy of his layered ceremonial robes . He stood before them in his smallclothes , unembarrassed . Ulfra assumed he was used to being dressed and undressed at the whim of his elders . A measuring tape was presented to her on a small cushion . Ulfra took it and began to measure the boy , stretching the tape taut along his shoulder and then down his back from the end of his neck to the bottom of his spine . He laughed when she measured his inseam , and his laugh , at least , was not pale and thin from lack of use . Like the look in his eyes , it spread through the room like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she wanted to ask , but in this dream she apparently had no power of speech . Still , the boy seemed to understand her , for he nodded and smiled . The measurements taken , contracts were produced and she was made to sign the papers in several places . The queen extended her hand , and Ulfra knelt to kiss the signet ring , startled at the sting of the cold elvish silver . Then the original messenger appeared and led her away . Over her shoulder she caught sight of the boy as he lifted his chin so that the governess could button him all the way up . Ulfra thought he winked . The messenger walked so quickly down the corridor that  | Ulfra could barely keep up . They passed the changing room without a pause , and she was about to ask if she should return her borrowed robe when she suddenly woke up . Sunlight was slanting through the dormer window ; from the foot of the bed the wolf watched her . For a moment she forgot where she was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ulfra laughed and related her dream . " Is n't it funny ? When I woke up I was so confused that I thought it was yesterday and that Opaline had been changed into a wolf ! " Tansy did not laugh , but went and examined the wardrobe . An odd feeling came over Ulfra as she watched the leopardwoman push aside the hanging clothes and rap the back of the wardrobe with her knuckles . " Tansy ! " The leopard-woman came and sat on the bed . " I 'm sorry ; I do n't mean to frighten you . It 's just that you 're not the first person to have an odd dream after spending a night in the same room with that wardrobe . It came down in my mother 's family , from a relative said to be one of the Banished . It was careless of me to give it to you . " " But it was a dream ! " Tansy shook her head . " I 'm afraid not . " She drew from her pocket a small folded paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back from the baker 's . " It was parchment , folded into a tight square and sealed with wax . Ulfra stared at the sign embossed in the wax and felt her lip ; where she had kissed the signet ring , there was a small spot blistered from cold . She broke the seal and unfolded the parchment . The sheet was large and closely written in a runish hand . At the bottom someone had signed a large letter Y with a flourish . Beside it , in her own hand , was written her name . Tansy shook her head . " This is no rune hand I 've ever seen .  | Look at the tails on the runes . Perhaps Lady Twixtwain will know someone who can translate it . In the meantime , we 'll have that damn thing " ? she nodded at the wardrobe ? " hauled back downstairs ! " " No . " Ulfra half shrugged , half shuddered , as if shaking off a chill . " I remember what it says . It 's a contract for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in black velvet , with silver buttons . I must complete it before the new moon , but I may only work by moonlight , and in silence . I remember how the last part goes : ' And lest my task should come to grief , No man so much as touch a sleeve . ' " Tansy stared . " Well , " she said when she found her voice again , " in that case , you had best go back to bed and get some sleep . You have your work cut out for you . "  | " Tomus . Tomus ! " Tomus 's dim form stirred at the foot of the bed . " What ? " he answered , his voice thick with sleep . " What 's a consort ? " Tomus yawned . It was the deepest part of the night and they both should have been fast asleep . " Du n no . Nothing good . " " What happened to the last one ? " " The R. H.A . declared him an Official Disgrace  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all the royal books . You know , the heavy ones . " " The Chronicles . " " Yeah , those . In the hall , where there should be a picture of the last Consort , there 's a tapestry of some old battle . "  | " Was he banished Above ? " Tomus yawned . " I ca n't remember . I think he became one of the weavers . " He had no better luck with Morag the following morning . " What 's a consort ? " Morag smiled her half smile , the way she did just before she was about to tell him something that was half true . " Well . . . I suppose it 's a little like Vervain 's elixir : a necessary unpleasantness . " The Universal Mineral Elixir for Complaints Royal , Goblin , and Mortal was a thick , bitter syrup compounded of rootwine , honey , and herbs . " Who are the weavers ? " This time Morag 's hands paused in their gathering-up of a blue stocking . She cast a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocking over his toes and heel , past his ankle , and up to his knee . " Why ever should you want to know about weavers , Pending ? " " I 've never heard anyone mention them before . I wondered where they were . " Morag smoothed the stocking up to his knee . " They 're off in one end of the palace , Pending . No one goes there . There 's not much to see but some dusty old tapestries . " " What do the weavers do , then ? " " Mostly they repair the seats of chairs and things . " She sat back on her heels and smiled , staring off into the air behind Pending 's head . " By all Below , I have n't thought of them in years . My family lived in quarters quite near the workrooms . When I was a girl , I used to fall asleep to the noise of the looms . " " Are they really all mad ? " " Gracious , Pending ! Where do you get all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Morag , " he said sternly , " this is very important . Are they all mad ? "  | She looked at him , then at the door . Something in her face relaxed slightly and something else in it tensed . " Some . Not all . " Were they mad when they became weavers , or did the weaving make them mad ? " " 1 ca n't say . And now , " she added in a tone that marked the matter closed , " you know as much as I do about weavers . " He did n't believe her . It is a lesser-known trait of the elvish race that it harbors a superstitious dread of throwing anything away . The lower levels of Ylfcwen 's palace were honeycombed with storerooms dating to the Early Epochs . Ethold and Pending had brought a picnic by dumbwaiter to one of them , spreading their feast on the floor among broken tag ends of furniture and dusty , rolledup carpets . They came upon an entire royal barge wrapped in muslin like a gigantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the barge , complete with movable oars . There was even a wooden elf queen with rooted silk hair and real dragonfly 's wings . Ethold gently worked the wings back and forth . The fifth time Pending said his name , he looked up . " I 'm sorry , Pending . What did you say ? " " I asked if you knew anything about the weavers . " Ethold nodded . He fitted the elf queen into the throne of her barge and , rewrapping the whole , placed it carefully back on the pile of forgotten playthings . " That 's a funny coincidence , Pending . I was just going to take you to see them . " They passed through what seemed like miles of corridors , through heavy curtains that hid much older passageways . " Tomus and I play hide-and-go-seek everywhere . We 've never gone anywhere near these tunnels . " " Well , I 'm sure Tomus has his orders , " said Ethold.  | They came to a small door set in the tunnel wall . It was barred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , identical to the set Vervain wore on a ribbon at her waist . Pending stared . " Those are keys from the Royal Household Agency ! " It was a high crime to steal or duplicate keys to the palace . " Very observant , Pending . Could you speak more softly ? It would n't go well with me if we were to be discovered . " Ethold turned one of the keys in the first lock and carefully drew back the bolts . He laid an ear to the remaining lock . " Charmed . They must know I have keys and are hoping I will trip an alarm . " Ethold drew from his pocket a pouch of silverygrey dust and blew a pinch of it into the final lock . The door opened soundlessly , at least to the boy 's human ears . Ethold paused , listening for something Pending could n't hear . " Forward , quietly . No whispering , it carries . Just keep your voice low , the way I do . " The door opened into a large workroom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately extinguished . Taking up one end of the room was a huge loom upon which a carpet was taking shape . It was unlike any of the tapestries that hung in the halls of the palace . Those weavings showed royal processions or represented the feasts of the elvish calendar : the dedication of the gifts , the blessing of the mines , the festival of the fireflies . This tapestry was something else altogether . Cords of silk , knotted one strand at a time , formed an intricate pattern of twined leaves and flowers . The blossoms shown were unlike any Pending had seen or sketched in the extensive palace hothouses and nurseries . Ethold fingered a small , white , heart-shaped flower . " They only bloom Above . " Stepping closer to see the weave , Pending saw brilliant flies and glossy beetles , perfect to the smallest detail , as though nature and not the weaver 's skill had made them . The carpet was cool  | to his touch and gave off a smell of crushed flowers and something he could not name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thoughts . " Sunshine burning the dew off a meadow . " Pending looked at him blankly . " Ah . Dew  --  how do I explain ? It 's a kind of rain that springs from the ground . Here , there is something else I have to show you . " At the other end of the workroom a low door opened on a bunk room , narrow and poorly lit , the air blue with the smoke of dreamlily . In the middle of the floor a few weavers shared a common water pipe . Others lay stretched on low cots around the room , dozing until it was time to return to the looms . " Can they hear us ? " " Yes , but only as you hear your own breathing without paying it any mind . They do n't know peace or pain  --  just oblivion . Their wages are paid in dreamlily , which dulls their wants and obliterates their cares . Even when they earn their freedom and can return Above , they seldom go . This is the only life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any notice of them . Seated apart from the others at a small table , he was thumbing through a thick sheaf of papers . He glanced at them and went back to his papers . " That 's the timekeeper , " Ethold 's voice said in the boy 's ear . " He assigns the work and doles out the dreamlily . " Ethold and Pending returned to the storeroom , but the picnic had lost its savor . Pending climbed into the royal barge and sat banging his heels against the base of the gilded throne . Ethold climbed in and sat at the boy 's feet . He picked up the toy barge and worked one of its oars . " There is something I must tell you , Pending . " " About the weavers ? "  | " Yes . But not just about them . " He paused , as if searching for the right words for what he had to say . " The first weavers were human , like you . They came Below by accident and were given a place at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and their goblin children were sent to work in the gemfields . The gems they harvested made the elvish queens wealthy . " One year a fever came . Many weavers and miners died . Suddenly there were fewer of them to work the looms and the mines . The elves could make do without tapestries , but gems were the lifeblood of the realm . " So the queen of that time sent a servant Above to take a human child and leave a goblin infant in its place . This was the first changeling . More followed . Some became weavers , gem cutters . One changeling , a tavern keeper 's son , became the queen 's cellar master . One became the first human Consort . They had a son , and for the first time , there was a goblin of royal blood . When that son grew up , he began to wonder why it was that the weavers lived as they did and why goblins worked the mines to make elves rich . " That was the beginning of the Goblin Wars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fog , startled to find himself seated in a decrepit old barge with faded cushions and cracked gilt . He looked at Pending and shook his head . " They 'll have raised the alarm for you hours ago . I had better get you back . " They gathered up the scattered plates and knives . Rather than wrap up the rest of the cake , Ethold broke it in two and crammed half into Pending 's mouth . " Eefold , " said the boy , muffled by cake . " Whmmf ? " Pending swallowed . " There was something else you were going to tell me . Not about the weavers . " Ethold shook his head . " Another time . "  | " We have it on the most reliable confidence that the Pretender has planted a spy in our midst . " Ylfcwen was trying to teach her pet mole to open pistachio nuts for her . She paused and looked up . " Why must I be concerned with it ? That 's what the Agency is for . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In another situation , we would not have had to involve madam . But , regrettably in this case , the infiltrator is one of madam 's own personal attendants . The Consort Pending himself has unwittingly carried messages . " The queen held up a hand . " You know I 'd rather have a tooth pulled than speak of such things . Just take care of it in the usual manner . I wish to hear no more about it . " The director bent low in a deep obeisance and noiselessly removed himself from the royal chamber . The queen looked down . Her pet mole had eaten all the pistachio nuts . She had picked up the creature and was cradling it beneath her chin when it came to her , what the director reminded her of : a statue before the sculptor had gotten around to the features . A chill crept over her , and she called for hot rootwine . Ethold waited an hour , and still she did not come . He had given up hope of her when a hooded figure approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure his mask covered his eyes . She made the secret sign , and he returned it . " Well met , " he said . " Well met . Why the mask ? " " A sensible precaution . " He laughed , shaking his head . " Tonight I had the strangest fancy that you had been found out and replaced by an agent of the R.H. A. " She laughed and pulled her hood a little closer around her face . " A strange fancy indeed . "  | " You do not sound like yourself . Have you caught a cold ? Here , let me feel if you have a fever . " As he reached out a hand she drew back , then lunged forward in an attempt to snatch off the mask . He seized her wrist in a tight grip . The imposter twisted but could not break free . The hood fell back to reveal the queen 's Mistress of the Stones  --  an agent of the R.H.A. " Do n't feel bad  --  it very nearly worked . You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't too bad . You could n't help it if your feet gave you away . " His voice grew cold and quiet . " Now , listen and listen well : Tell your director to inform the queen that we will not be turned back by so shabby a ruse . " He released her , and she fled on the feet that had betrayed her . Like all agents of the R.H.A. , she had a completely silent footfall , but her feet were too big to be those of the woman she was impersonating . If they knew the secret sigh , then they might know the rest . He thought of his love . She had been found out ; it would not go well with her . She had , as they all did , a poison pellet . By now she had surely taken it . Ethold pulled the mask from his face and stared at the strip of black bandage , fighting back a choking terror that rose in his throat . He sank to the floor of the tunnel in a crouch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken it . Z The suit was done . Almost all of the silver had gone to purchase the pearls and the silver thread . Tansy had let her have the velvet and lace as an advance on her allowance . The workmanship was particularly fine . Tansy counted twenty stitches to the inch on the seams and gave up counting on the buttonholes . The leopard-woman glanced at her apprentice . Ulfra was  | somewhat thinner and her hair wanted washing , but her face brimmed with an exhausted elation usually seen in women who have just given birth . " And six hours to spare ! " Ulfra said through a great yawn . Tansy folded the suit and laid it in the box . " I have to admit , I had my doubts you could finish it in such a short space of time . You certainly deserve a rest . Why do n't you have a bath , " she said , " and I 'll fry you a chop . " But Ulfra was fast asleep , her head on the worktable . Tansy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick at her feet , then gave the suit a final pressing before wrapping it . She wondered where to leave the parcel  --  the messenger had n't said ? before deciding the wardrobe was the most logical place . Tansy wrote out the bill and slid it beneath the cord that bound the box , then placed it on a high shelf and closed the wardrobe doors . In the morning , the box was gone , but the bill remained , beneath a large sum in new-minted silver . At the bottom someone had added in pencil , " Many thanks . It suits perfectly . " Z Z Z Things , animate and inanimate , that make the passage from the one world to the Otherworld often undergo a transformation . The arrival of the examination suit was anxiously awaited , and when it arrived it was unwrapped with no little trepidation . Ylfcwen was quite pleased ; at a Royal Examination long ago , a suit of ermine had fared badly , arriving as no more than a motheaten muff . The examinee was forbidden to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whipping boy was fetched to model the suit before the queen . Ylfcwen lay on her lounge and gazed at the suit , Tomus squirmed and was pinched by the queen 's dresser . " One sleeve is a little longer than the other , " observed the queen .  | The dresser cleared her throat . " Rather , madam , one is a little shorter so the examinee shall not get ink upon his cuff . " " Ah , " replied the queen . But she no longer saw the suit , for she was remembering her fourth husband and only beloved as he looked the day he was examined . Above , he had been a soldier turned highwayman , sentenced to hang for his misdeeds . The day before he was to be led to the gallows , he had tunneled from his cell into the Otherworld . He had an eye for gems , and was being trained for work as a gem cutter when he caught the queen 's eye . A tall man of fine form , with red-gold hair like pale flames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice . A mortal tailor , long since dust , had fashioned a suit to the style of the day : blue-and-gold brocade touched with snowy ermine and lined with crimson silk . In it , he had seemed all fire and air and light , a fearsome angel summoned from the blue void at the edge of the world . She had stitched the examination answers into his cuff herself . There was no sense taking chances when you were up against the R.H.A. When it was over and the crown was on his brow , she had held to his lips the silver cup of forgetfulness . Then she had inscribed his name in the registry beside her own , the fourth Consort Royal , and , she devoutly wished , the last . But mortal love is a fickle thing . Deprived of light and air and freedom , the new Consort did not thrive . Perhaps he took no joy in riches freely given , only in those stolen in the night . Perhaps he had drunk too deeply from the cup  --  her hand had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to soaking up cordials of rootwine and stronger stuff . He grew suspicious and fearful and , in the end , quite mad , a ravaged figure roaming the corridors in tattered raiments . At some point , he had become a ghost . The actual point at which he ceased to number among the living was difficult to determine . By then he had become a weaver .  | The director of the R.H.A. had just asked a question . Ylfcwen shut her eyes and snored a subtle snore . After much whispered discussion , they left the room . When the sound of their withdrawing subsided , she opened one eye . The whipping boy was sitting there , like a forgotten comb or shoehorn : something not thought of until it was required . " Come , " she said . " Sit here . " Tomus clambered up into her lap . Ylfcwen trained her opalescent eyes on him . " You thought I would be bony . " He returned her gaze unblinkingly . " I am very light , you see . Without weights or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I grow older it will get worse . I will grow less and less substantial , until I am overwhelmed by a compulsion to fly . At that time my reign will come to an end , and a new queen will be crowned in my place . " Not sure what to say , Tomus said nothing at all . Ylfcwen 's arms crept around the goblin boy . Late one night her son had slipped from his handlers and she had left the Consort Royal to his rootwine to meet the boy in a forgotten storeroom . For an hour mother and child had huddled in a silent embrace , each lulled by the heartbeat of the other , until the handlers found them and pried them apart . After that , she saw her son very little . There had been a sudden increase in documents requiring her urgent attention , the documents had been very long . The director of the R. H. A. reappeared . He stood and stared at the sight of the queen holding the palace whipping boy upon her knee . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has occurred to you that I do not wish to be disturbed . " " This is most unseemly ? "  | " I shall do what pleases me . And it pleases me that this child should sit on my knee as my own son could never do . " A rare expression crossed the director 's face . It had something in it of glee and something else of malice . Then it was gone . " It is about your son , madam , that I must speak with you . " Vervain was late for the Consort Pending 's appointed geometry lesson . To pass the time , Pending dragged the heavy Chronicles from their high shelf , nearly toppling down the library steps in the process . To his disappointment , there was nothing about weavers , but there was an interesting entry under Consort . In the twelfth year of the Fifth Cycle of the Tenth Epoch of the Dynasty of the Lily , her supreme and divine majesty Ylfcwen , daughter of Yvaine , granddaughter of Ylyssia , great-granddaughter of Ygwynyd , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comely face and plaintive way with a harp , had escaped indenture at the looms . Crowning him Consort , she bore of him a son , named here something had been blotted out by the censors of the Royal Household Agency who was raised to take his place as the first king in three Epochs . In his sixteenth year , however , spurned his place at his mother 's side and entered a self-imposed exile Above , where he lives to this day as a mortal man . The queen 's Consort was so grieved at his son 's behavior that he drowned himself in the sacred lake . Since that day , there has been no other Consort Royal . Try as he might , Pending could not lift the censor 's blot . He even tried a little of Vervain 's Universal Mineral Elixir on the end of his pencil eraser , to no avail . No doubt the ink had been charmed . Pending was peacefully engaged in mixing hot candle  | wax and spit into ink lifter when he heard a disembodied voice call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Over by the bookshelves . There 's an old spy hole . Put your ear to it . " Pending obeyed . " Listen carefully , Pending . There is n't time for long explanations . Vervain has been arrested by the R.H.A. " " Arrested ! " " They have charged her with being a spy for the goblins . She had been an agent of the R.H.A. , but she was swayed to our cause by you , Pending . She could n't bear to see you become the next Consort . " Pending 's eyes filled with hot tears . " Ca n't we save her ? " " No , Pending . But you must listen carefully and do exactly as I say . Go back to your room as if nothing has happened . Tomus will be waiting for you . Change clothes with him , he will take you to the tunnel that leads to the underground lake . I 'll meet you there . " " But  --  Morag ? " " I 'm sorry , Pending . It would be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now you must hurry . " In Pending 's clothes , Tomus looked remarkably like a Consort Pending . " Do I look like a whipping boy ? " asked Pending . Tomus squinted at him . " You 'll do . Here  --  Ethold said to give you this . " He handed him a bundle . " Now we 've got to be quick . Follow me . " They left the main corridors for the less-used passageways . " Tomus . When he showed me the weaving rooms , Ethold said you never took me there because you had your orders . Whose orders ? "  | " The R.H.A. Do n't give me that look  --  I was n't with them ; I just pretended to be . Vervain used you to send messages , but she was afraid that if she did it too often she would be found out . So sometimes she used me , in the dumbwaiter . If I was caught , I was to say I was playing hide-and-go-seek with you . " They had come to a branching of tunnels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will meet you here . " The whipping boy put out his hand . Pending grasped it and shook it . " Maybe they wo n't find you out and you 'll have to sit for that examination . And that 's another thing  --  you knew what a consort was all the time ! " Tomus shrugged . " Maybe I did . Now I have to get back , before you 're missed . Good luck . " And he was gone back down the tunnel , the way they had come . Pending was shifting from foot to foot , thinking that whipping boys ' clothes were n't quite as warm as those for consorts pending , when Ethold appeared , carrying a bundle like his own . He was changed . It was not just the light and echo of the tunnel ; something about his face and voice was not the same . But he came up smiling and rubbed Pending 's hands in his own great ones to warm them . " Have you grown cold waiting ? I 'm sorry  --  I had some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you swim ? " " Only a little . " " No matter . I can swim for us both , as long as you can hold your breath . Can you do that ? " " Yes , but where are we going ? " " Above , through the underground lake . " s F Morag discovered the substitution at once , but was too frightened to say anything . She gave Tomus a bath and put him to bed early and told the director of the R. H. A. that the Consort  | Pending was upset about Vervain , having been close to his governess . Morag could not tell whether he believed her . She stood in the doorway and watched the goblin boy sleep . He was some relation of hers , distantly descended from the same human ancestor , a renowned goldsmith who had had quite a way with the ladies of the elvish court . The human features were uppermost in him . Could it work , could he possibly pass for the human boy ? But even if he did , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy ? There came a soft knock at the door , and she found herself staring down at a goblin boy just Tomus 's height . Armon 's boy , Fegyn , if her memory served her right . " Let me guess : You are the new whipping boy . " He smiled shyly and nodded . Morag opened the door wider . " You 'd best get to bed , then . I am sure the Consort Pending will explain your duties in the morning . " Ylfcwen retired to her chamber to find a parcel on the foot of her bed . It was about the size of a shoe and was wound tightly with fine muslin . The object was familiar but unexpected , as though it were something she had seen in a dream and had not expected to encounter while waking . She sat cross-legged on the bed and unwrapped it . It was a perfect model of the royal barge , beautifully carved and gilded . On the throne sat a tiny elf queen with rooted silk hair and real dragonfly 's wings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into one of the oar locks . Mother , I know when I have been bested and so I will for a little time  | withdraw . I have wounds to lick . Perhaps the rarer air Above will restore me . It is said to have such powers . You will forgive me , I think , for taking the boy . Perhaps you will eventually thank me . For a while I have suspected it was not a consort you saw in him but a less rebellious son . But he has a mother and he shall be returned to her . You will find another left in his place  --  a sort of changeling . You may think it a poor joke , and perhaps it is . Yet with the advantages you can give him , he might prove devoted enough . When the R.H.A. came to you , did you know it was Vervain ? I like to think they kept it from you . You did n't love her as I did , but I do n't believe Vervain ever disappointed you . You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love about it . Until we meet again , I am your well-meaning son , Ethold-that-was-Aethyr Ylfewen furled the note and hid it in the hollow handle of her ivory wing burnisher . She was feeling light-bodied and poured herself a glass of rootwine but did not drink it . She lay back on the bed and gazed at the walls of her bedchamber , covered with a tapestry of living violets . She did feel very peculiar , as though the air disagreed with her . Perhaps she needed to fly a little . She slipped off the ankle weights and drifted to the vaulted ceiling . I must tell the dresser to have it dusted up here , she thought dreamily . There were fewer fireflies than she remembered from her last flight , and more cobwebs and moths , but it was pleasant all the same . It seemed a shame about the suit . By the time they had coached the new Consort for the examination , a new suit would be required . But perhaps there would be no Consort at all . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would almost have suspected Tomus the whipping boy of being Vervain and  | Ethold 's son . She was sometimes struck by the fact that she had so far escaped having a grandchild , despite her rapidly advancing years . Five marriages and only one child to show for it , and him the Goblin Pretender . It was too much . F The sacred lake glittered cold and smooth as a facet of onyx . Its shores were littered with drifts of dried jasmine flowers from the most recent dedication of the gifts . Far off at the lake 's center , Pending could make out the cold gleam of the shrine 's silver spires . " There 's a long dive to a tunnel , and at the end of that a shorter dive that will bring us Above . " Ethold was tying their bundles tightly to his back . " The other routes will be watched , but they do n't remember this one . If we 're traced , they will assume we drowned . " Pending shivered . They had stripped to their smallclothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold . " Then we 're not coming back ? Not ever ? " It was then that Ethold sat him on one of the carved stone seats and told him of his real name and his mortal mother . He pictured a house with spires at the edge of the blue void , surrounded by all the flowers from the weavers ' carpet . His mother was at the door . Her face was a little like Vervain 's and a little like Morag 's , and her hair was rooted silk . Ethold had led him to the point along the shore where the water was deepest . They were standing on the brink . Ethold 's voice was telling him to fill his lungs , to hold on tight and jump at the count of three . There was no splash . The cold waters of the lake closed around them .  | As it happened , Pending 's mortal mother lived not on the edge of a blue void but in the heart of a great and ancient forest that divided the three realms of Twinmoon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the west . This was the Weirdwood , its green twilight ruled by the Direwolves and watched over by the silent flights of owls . At its center stood a massive oak , set with a red door , that had once been home to a witch . These days there were different tenants , the Binders and their boy . It was early morning on a cold spring day . A man and boy emerged from the thick growth of hemlocks into the small clearing surrounding the oak . Binder 's hair glinted gold in the weak sunshine ; his darker beard was well trimmed and he wore round spectacles . The boy was about seven . His face peeked out from  | a blue hood , apples in his cheeks from the cold , his eyes an odd , pale brown . The man had a basket strapped to his back ; the boy carried five trout on a string . They paused by the door to use the boot scraper ( added since the witch 's time ) and let themselves in . The boy took off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deep russet of a fox 's tail and stood up in unruly peaks . His eyes were not pale brown after all , but yellow as a cat 's . His ears were small and flat to his head and slightly pointed . He was , in other words , a goblin child . He went and stirred up the fire . Binder shrugged the basket off onto the table and began to remove its contents : a honeycomb wrapped in leaves , some speckled eggs packed in spongy moss to keep them from breaking , and a number of more ordinary parcels : butter , cheese , candles , a piece of soap . " When you 've put the kettle on , why do n't you clean those fish ? " said Binder over his shoulder . " Out by the stump would be a good place . " The boy fetched the scaling knife and took up the string of trout . He turned back at the door . " After , can I go see Sleeker ? " " Yes , but do n't be long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother , she has n't taken so much as a cup of tea . " The boy nodded and went out . Binder put away the provisions and went down the twisty , narrow stairs . The tiny room had once been a root cellar ; now it held a finishing stove , sewing frame , and lying press . Beneath his short beard and behind his wire spectacles , Binder had the look of the perpetual wanderer come to rest . He once had been a knight of Chameol ; now he was a binder and mender of books . He lit the finishing stove and set the glue pot on it to warm , then went upstairs , where the water had come to a boil . He brewed a pot of woodmint tea and took it up the ladder to the room nestled among the oak 's uppermost branches . From the look of the workroom , it seemed as though the  | old witch was still in residence . Among the pots of shade-loving herbs that lined the windowsill were lizards in bottles , moths on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , white masks , no bigger than acorns , that were the skulls of shrews and mice . At a worktable piled with books and papers , Caitlin sat bent over a sheet covered with runes . Seer 's eyes , one blue , one green , gazed out from a face pale by nature and made more so by overwork . She had wound a length of her blue-black hair around one hand and was tugging at it absently as she worked . Binder noticed a pair of hair combs  --  his present to her on their last anniversary  --  lying on the worktable and smiled . She was always complaining of her hair and threatening to cut it . He told her that if she did , she would never get anything done ; she could only think , he chided her , while tugging at her hair . Binder handed her a cup of tea . She shook her head , as if coming out of a spell , muttered thanks , and took a scalding swallow . He watched as some color returned to her cheeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the book . Caitlin grimaced . " Not so well . As soon as I think I 've got the hang of it , the text shifts and changes . I suppose it 's just eyestrain , but I 'd swear the damn runes are doing it on purpose . " Behind the spectacles his eyes gleamed dangerously . " Well , if you will stay up all night and not come to bed ? " " If I recall correctly , you were the one who fell asleep taking his boots off . I came to bed to find you snoring away , one boot on and one boot off . " " No changing the subject , " he said , taking the tea from her hand and holding it out of her reach . " You have been sadly derelict in your wifely duties . " Caitlin smiled and reached for her tea . " You know very well that I would n't know a wifely duty if it bit me on the nose . Let me have my tea and I promise to be more tractable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the nose . A skirmish broke  | out , and they fell to the floor with a bump . The tea spilled and went unnoticed . She laid a finger on his lips . " Before this goes any further ? where 's Grimald ? " He kissed her finger . " Looking for his otter . Damn ! " He sat up , raking a hand through his hair so that it stood on end . " I told him not to be long . " Before she could answer , there arrived at the window a pigeon with a green band on one leg . Caitlin went to the window . As she was unfastening the capsule on the bird 's leg , she caught her husband 's eye . " I 'm sorry  --  it 's from Iiliana . " He gave the bird a dark look and smiled wryly . " It 's all right . I have fish to fry . " He swung down the ladder and out of sight . She placed the pigeon in a cage and gave it seed and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's former queen , now its High Counsel and Ambassador to the Thirteen Kingdoms . My dear , I am in Twelvemoon , heaven help me , trying to sort out which of the late monarch 's offspring has a legitimate claim to the throne . There a great many contenders from both sides of the blanket , as they say , and I will be detained here until the turning of the year . I am very sorry , and not just for the dreariness of life here . It 's past time you visited me and Chameol . The sun and sea would do you good and , besides , we could put our heads together about the Books . ? Iiliana P. S. The library here yielded nothing about the runes you sent . The best I can do is confirm your suspicion that they are not a living rune tongue . They are most likely lulian . When she left the isle of Chameol , where she had been apprenticed as a seer , Caitlin brought with her the ancient book  | of incantations that had belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenant of the oak with the red door . The book held the secrets of the long-lost kingdom of Iule , long buried beneath the waves by the necromancer Myrrhlock . Now that the wizard had been defeated , the secrets of lule remained to be uncovered . Chameol had been the kingdom 's seat of learning , with a library of fabulous books , the jewels of which were four powerful books of magic : the Books of Naming , Healing , Summoning , and Changing . When lule sank beneath the sea , the Keepers of the Books had smuggled them from Chameol . It was said that in the centuries since , they had been broken up and sold for relics ; the pages that survived had been stitched together by some long-dead owner into Abagtha 's book of incantations . Tackling the runes had been a penance of a kind , a compensation to liliana for abandoning Chameol and life as a seer . Raising Grimald in the harsh Weirdwood , there had not been much time for runes at first . Now they were a welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Caitlin did not dwell on the fact that her seer 's gift had abandoned her . Since her marriage her visions had grown less and less frequent . Two years ago , they had stopped altogether after the death from fever of her only daughter , Rowan . The runes had that power , at least : They kept her private ghosts and demons at bay . Caitlin sighed and glanced at the piles on the worktable , pages from Abagtha 's book , which had been pulled to pieces . The leaves were sorted by kind into four piles . Some were richly illuminated in brilliant reds and blues and burnished gold leaf . Some were closely written in crabbed , dark runes . Others flowed with an elegant cursive hand , with cryptic diagrams and marginal notes in red . The last pile held leaves from an herbal , so lifelike that it seemed the plants were not painted but pressed between the pages . As she looked at them , Caitlin felt compelled to resume her work , the impenetrable runes seemed to exert a strange pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the window , the pages seemed to cast a faint , irresistible glow . But as the smell of frying trout reached her from below , a pang hit her in the pit of the stomach , equal parts guilt and hunger . Caitlin went down the ladder . Grimald was laying the table . Besides the smoking hot trout , there was sour rye bread , a cheese , and applesauce . Caitlin bent to kiss the boy 's forehead . " Did you find Sleeker ? " Grimald shook his head . " It 's days since I saw him . I 'm thinking  --  I 'm thinking maybe a wolf got him . " He said it matter-of-factly , but she knew how he really felt . The otter had been hand-raised since before his eyes were open . He was not truly wild and not as wary of the wood as he should be . A Direwolf would make short work of him . " Oh , I do n't know about that , " she said . " After all , he 's grown now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladylove and settle down . " Binder set the platter of fish on the table . " Just think : If he 's being shy with you , he 'll be that much safer around wolves and such . " This seemed to cheer the boy , and he held out his plate . Grimald had cleared the table and gone back out into the wood . He had his lessons at night by the fire ; as long as it was light , the Weirdwood was his teacher . Now that it was beginning to thaw , there were shrew skulls to be dug up and nets to check for bats . And otters to look for , Binder and Caitlin thought as they watched him go . Binder divided the last of the tea between their cups . " Do you think a wolf really got Sleeker ? " he asked at last . She shrugged . " By now Grimald knows the wood almost as  | well as I do . But I do n't think even he knows . You always hope they will get to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They both fell silent , thinking of Rowan . If she had lived , she would now be five . Caitlin had stayed by the child 's sickbed until she , too , fell ill . To keep the boy from the infection , Binder had walked him to the nearest farm . When he returned at last with help , Caitlin was delirious and the fever had settled in little Rowan 's lungs . She was buried in a quiet , mossy spot marked with a white stone and grown over with lilies-of-the-wood . They had each blamed themselves and , in the worst moments of their grief , each other . They thought of leaving the wood . Binder had been unable to set himself up as a printer , and to keep body and soul together , Caitlin had had to bottle herb remedies to sell in the nearest market town . Her researches into the runes had been abandoned . Grimald had developed night terrors and could only sleep if one of them spent the night beside him . Then Grimald had mined one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Chameol . In mending the broken spine and torn pages , Binder found a craft that could support them . Once a month he collected mending from an old bookbinder whose fingers were grown too stiff to keep up with all the work . Caitlin still bottled enough simples to pay for the little books of gold leaf for the binding and new shoes for Grimald . Binder laced his fingers with hers and gave her hand a squeeze . " Back to work , I 'm afraid . I promised Femius I 'd have the next lot for him a little early . One 's a real bear  --  thirteen foldout charts in need of patching . " " So much for my wifely duties . Well , I have a letter to answer and runes to crack . " He shook his head at her . " For heaven 's sake , try to get some sleep first . " When he had gone down to the bindery , Caitlin went back  | up to the workroom , pausing at the basin to bathe her eyes . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never say it , she looked more than tired . Her face was lined with weariness . She cursed the runes under her breath . For their sake she was ruining her health , straining her husband 's affection , neglecting her child , and wearing away her sanity  --  yet their meaning remained just beyond her reach . He 's right , she thought , I do need a nap . She kicked off her shoes and stretched out on the cot . The runes still danced before her eyes , but she made herself draw even breaths , imagining a vine of ornament growing over the runes , shutting them out . Between the leaves of the vine she imagined a door . She opened it and saw the gardens of Chameol , liliana seated on a stone bench reading a book . Seeing Caitlin , the High Counsel of Chameol smiled and held out the book so that Caitlin could read the cover : Ancient Rune Tongues Explained . Caitlin walked toward her . Z There never was a colder place or one more lonely than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wood . In its black surface , last fall 's leaves were frozen in a thin glaze of ice . Grimald knelt on the bank , a dark , wet bundle in his arms . He had found Sleeker . One of the otter 's hind legs had been crushed by the jaws of a trap . He had bound the leg as best he could , but Sleeker had stopped moving . Grimald was sure Sleeker was dead ; as soon as he was done with his good-byes , he would bury him . His thick tears fell onto the otter 's glossy pelt . " Hello . What have you got there ? " said a voice softly . Grimald had not heard the man approach . He was young and clean-shaven , his hair pulled back in a lock beneath a widebrimmed hat . He wore a heavy traveling cloak and carried a pack . Without ceremony he crouched beside Grimald and exam-  | fined Sleeker with hands that were as kind and gentle as his voice . " 1 think he 's dead , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite . It 's good you tied up his leg the way you did . Here , we 'll bathe him in the spring and then take him back . He 's your pet ? You live in the Weirdwood , then ? " Grimald nodded . He watched the man pickup the wounded otter and break the thin ice to bathe the injured leg . The boy turned his face from the sight of the otter 's teeth bared in a grimace of pain . When he looked back , the man had wrapped the otter in the folds of his cloak . " What 's your name ? " " Grimald . " " Well , Grimald , I 'm Fell . It 's a lucky thing I found you , for I 'm lost . I 'd be grateful for a chance to warm myself before I make my way out of the wood . " Binder met them at the door , his heart in his throat . He had not seen Grimald , only a man bearing down on the house , a bundle wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me witless . Get inside before you freeze solid . " Caitlin appeared at the top of the stair , barefoot , clutching her box of remedies . As his father helped him out of his wet clothes , Grimald shook his head , his teeth chattering . " No  --  Sleeker first ? " Fell gave a loud yell . He had just received an otter bite on the hand . He handed Sleeker over to the boy , who had struggled from Binder 's grasp . Speechless , the boy nuzzled his face in the creature 's fur . Sleeker gave a weak prrt-prrt of contentment . Caitlin examined the young man 's hand . Luckily the otter was tame to start with and weak from his own wound , an otter bite can break bones . She did not tell the young man this . When the bite was dressed she turned her attention to the otter .  | " It 's a simple fracture . If we can keep him still and warm , it should mend . Grimald , go cut me some green wood for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dry clothes . Dwarfed in one of Binder 's wool shirts and clumsy in his mother 's boots , the boy stomped out , glad of something to do . As Binder pressed a cup of hot rum into his hands , Fell turned to Caitlin with a stunned look . " But the trap . . . that leg was badly crushed . I saw it . And when we came up to the house , he had stopped moving . I was sure the creature was dead . " Caitlin shook her head . " It was hard even for me to tell , with the blood and the fur around the wound . It must have looked a lot worse to you . But tell me , how did you happen into the middle of all this ? " The young man blushed . " I set off to seek my fortune . I 'm afraid I got lost . " He lifted his chin . " My late father was a goldsmith , I am the youngest of his sons . Between them , my brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find a trade . I came to the Weirdwood looking for a binder I was told lived here . " " My husband is the bookbinder , if it 's that kind of binding you want . " " It is . So I am not lost , after all . " Binder shook his head . " Even if we could offer room and board , I could n't take on an apprentice . I 'm not a master yet myself , I rely on the binder in town to give me what work I have . Besides , to become apprenticed you need to be sixteen . " Fell drew himself up . " I 'm nineteen ! Nearly twenty . " Without the wide-brimmed hat and cloak , he was revealed as the youth he was  --  tall for his age but slight of frame . Binder smiled and tried to repair the slight . " Then you are more skilled with a razor than I was at your age . No offense . " " None taken . " Caitlin looked at Fell closely . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But his clothes , though simple , were very well  | made , not those of a youngest son without prospects . Some impediment other than lack of fortune stood in his way . Fell seemed uneasy beneath her gaze . He turned down their invitation to stay to supper , reaching for his hat . " I have no wish to outstay my welcome . " " Nonsense ; your cloak is not yet dry . If you ca n't stay to supper , at least let me show you the workshop . You 'll still have time to reach the edge of wood before dark . " Once in the workroom , Fell 's shyness fell away , and his features grew almost animated as he asked questions about the tools and materials . Binder watched him thoughtfully . At last Fell 's departure could be put off no longer , and they ascended to the kitchen to retrieve the cloak , now dry . " Bookbinding 's hardly the only trade you could learn , " said Binder . " 1 hear there is a good living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fell the name of an artisan in the town . " Thank you . I am sorry you can not take an apprentice , sir , for I feel we should have got on well . Good day to you . " " Best of luck to you . " He bowed his way out . Through the window they could see him saying his farewell to Grimald where the boy was cutting splints of green ash . " It 's a shame , in a way , " said Binder . " He would have been a friend to Grimald . " " Yes , " was all Caitlin said . She did not like to tell her husband so , but she thought the young man more secretive than shy and , no matter what his story , he was no poor youngest son . That night , Caitlin came late to bed , hours after her husband had carried Grimald up to the workroom to kiss her good night . She crept down the ladder to the room they shared , a tiny chamber taken up almost entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Binder had made shelves for the curved wall at  | the head of the bed , the brackets carved in a pattern of ivy and fitted to hold candles . She placed her candle in the headboard . He had fallen asleep half dressed , without climbing all the way beneath the covers . One hand still clutched his spectacles . Caitlin eased them from his grasp and laid them on one of the shelves . Hurrying in the chill of the room , she changed into her nightclothes and climbed into bed . At this slight movement he turned toward her , still deep in sleep , burrowing his face into the warmth between her neck and shoulder . She lifted her head and gazed at him for a time before she blew out the candle , thinking , searching his face for traces of her lost Rowan and of another child , the son whose place Grimald had taken , whose place he could never take . Binder had changed  --  in name , for one : Only she called him Badger now . To Grimald he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew Binder . In appearance , too , he was altered . The close work of the bindery and the scant light of the Weirdwood had taken their toll on his eyes  --  thus the fine lines in their outer corners and the wire-rimmed spectacles . He had grown the beard during the dark days surrounding Rowan 's illness and death . He wore it now , years later , less a badge of grief , more a kind of remembrance . Binder had never believed that Grimald was a changeling . As the child grew and began more and more to resemble a goblin , he remained convinced that Grimald was his child . And in many ways human love had made the boy human . The boy was too young to know he was different from them . Caitlin was resolved to tell him  --  and loathe to . So she alone knew , knew and remembered . Dark-haired Bram , her firstborn , her first-lost . Rowan had been flaxen-haired , a rebuke to her hope that Bram somehow might be reborn in their second child . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift she was than she was taken , too . That was why she came late to bed , well after Binder was asleep : to deny herself the comfort and solace of her husband 's  | arms , to atone for trying to remake Bram , to make certain there would be no more grieving for another lost child . She blew out the candle and lay back in bed , turning her back to him , hugging her knees . With effort she emptied her mind of all thoughts , slowing her breaths until at last she drifted off . In sleep , he drew nearer again , matching his posture to hers limb for limb , twining his fingers in her loose hair . Pending was cold , so cold he burned with it . He did not remember surfacing , he did not remember setting foot Above . Cold made all his senses shrink until they were a shuddering core in his numb body . A voice came to him faintly . Hot liquid passed between his lips , like rootwine , but not so bitter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not . This frightened him , until he saw that he was only weighed down by heavy furs . He was in a small space with irregular walls and a roof only a few feet above his head . There was a strange , thick smell made up of many other smells , it was not unpleasant . He was aware of being warm . Eyes glinted at him in the darkness . Goblin eyes . " Here . Take this , " said Ethold 's voice . The boy heard the light scrape of a spoon against the side of a bowl . He had never tasted anything like it , but it was hot and sweet and thick and delicious . He ate every spoonful and fell back upon his bed into a deep sleep . Binder stood and scowled at the open cupboards . " Did you give Fell any food ? " Caitlin looked up from the floor , where she and Grimald were sprawled over a game of his invention called liar 's checkers . " No , why ? Is anything missing ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first it was a  | crock of honey here , a loaf of bread there . I figured you 'd gone on one of your midnight cupboard raids . " She smiled . " I see . Go on . " " Then some cider went missing  --  and the bottles turned up , empty . We 're low on candles , and I know I bought enough to last another three weeks . And just yesterday I set some applesauce on the table by the window to cool , and a little while later it was gone , bowl and all . " Grimald captured the last of her dried lizards , winning the game , but Caitlin did n't seem to notice . " Come to think of it , " she said , sitting up , " someone 's been at my herb garden , too . I thought it was rabbits , but it was too regular for that . And they were peculiar herbs  --  things a rabbit would n't eat . " " But medicinal ? " said Binder . " Not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Cider , perhaps , and honey ? " " Yes . What will you do ? " " Hang some sausages up in the shed . A neighbor 's a neighbor , invisible or not . " He put on his coat and went out . " Who 's invisible ? " Grimald asked . " No one . Your father only means that we 've never seen the person who 's been taking the food . Now , are you going to give me a chance to win a game and redeem myself ? " " All right . " " Well , I get the lucky piece this time . Fair 's fair . " Pending opened his eyes , and for the first time in days he could really see and hear and smell and think . He lay on a bed of furs in a small room with earthern walls and a low earthern ceiling from which tree roots protruded like crooked beams . Through the low , arched entrance he could see Ethold outside , crouched by a smoky fire .  | He struggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he got to the door the light of the clearing struck his eyes and made him dizzy . Ethold looked up from the cider he was warming . " Well , Bram , how are you feeling ? " The boy remembered what Ethold had told him at the edge of the underground lake . This was his new name , his real name . It sounded strange . " Achy . The light hurts my eyes . Did I almost drown ? " " No , you made the dive beautifully . But coming Above affects people differently . You got a bad case of light sickness , on top of a nasty cold . Here . Drink this . " Ethold handed him a cup of cider with honey and herbs . " Is it a wolves ' den ? " he asked , after he had swallowed . There had been pictures of wolves in the Fabulous Beastiary Vervain had given him for his fifth birthday . " No , a poacher 's den , I think . " " Is this where we are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . The poacher will want it back . You 're going to live with your mother . " Then Bram remembered . The light sickness had driven it from his mind . Anticipation and a sick dread gave him a queasy feeling in the pit of his stomach . He spoke around the knot that had formed in his throat . " Where will you go ? " " Away , to a new life . " The goblin stared into the coals , then looked up at the boy , his amethyst eyes bright . " I will have a new name , like you . " Bram opened his mouth to ask another question , but Ethold gave the smallest shake of his head . Then the goblin opened wide his arms and the boy stepped into them . The hot knot in his throat untied itself , unraveling in hoarse sobs that echoed in the little clearing . Even muffled by the goblin 's coat , it was a dismal sound .  | It was early and grey . Though she had been up for hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Binder and Grimald had gone off before dawn to walk to the nearest farm ; the Harriers ' mare had had twin foals . The house , indeed the whole wood , seemed to ache with stillness ; Caitlin fought a temptation to leap and stamp and shout to dispel it . There was something uncanny , almost otherworldly about the heavy quiet . It was as if , once alone with her , the runes were trying to speak . The air hummed with the silence that was almost itself a sound . She got up from her worktable and went to the basin to wash her face , glad of the noise the water made pouring from the bright blue pitcher . As she bent to cup the cold water in her hands , there rose in her mind a fragment of a remembered dream : a woman seated in a garden , holding out a book . It was the garden on Chameol , the woman was Liliana ( no mistaking those coppery tresses ) , and the cover of the book read Ancient Rune Tongues Explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basin , the room , everything else forgotten . Could she remember the rest of the dream ? She had been awakened abruptly , when Fell and Grimald had brought the wounded otter into the house , and had not thought of it since . As a seer on Chameol , she had been trained to remember and interpret her dreams , even to summon them . Since Rowan 's death she had all but abandoned the practice , but it was as much a part of her as memory and needed only to be called on . She called on it now . She was back in the palace garden at Chameol . Liliana was sitting on a stone bench , reading . She walked toward her . Liliana held out the book . She took it . It was heavy , much too heavy for its size . She opened it , but it was unreadable . The runes upon the page shifted and buzzed before her eyes , then slowly resolved into the shapes of bees , circling on a blank page . She turned to Liliana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but liliana was gone . In her place on the stone seat sat a boy of seven or so , with black hair and eyes as amber as honey . He gazed at her solemnly and held out his hands , which were full of jasmine petals . No sooner had she taken the flowers from his outstretched hands than the bees began to desert Ancient Rune Tongues Explained for the sweet , papery petals . When the last bee had left the page , ghostly shapes could be seen to form there , the shadows of the shadows of runes . And there the dream ended . Caitlin let loose a shout of frustration . " It ca n't end there ! It simply ca n't ! " She went downstairs and put the empty kettle on the fire . When it squealed immediately in protest she took if off the fire , filled it , and stood a minute staring at it . Then she emptied the kettle and put it away . She took up her cloak and a basket and left the house . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked through the wood she listened intently for a twig snap , a sleepy birdcall , any sound breaking through the oppressive stillness , the great held breath of the Weirdwood . The place where she usually found the best mushrooms was not far from the mossy bank where Rowan was buried , but Caitlin did not stop to visit the grave . Her errand , begun out of exasperation , somehow had become too important to be put off . When at last she reached the spot , she understood why . There were no mushrooms after all , only a small boy , curled up asleep at the base of a tree , his grimy face streaked with tears . Caitlin stood a long time , wondering at him : at his hair , sooty as a raven 's wing ; at the strange silver ring upon his finger . She stood clutching her empty basket , afraid to wake him lest he should prove a trick of her dreams , another taunt of the runes . At last she did reach forward and gently shook him by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little afraid , and  | then the boy held out his hand and she took it and led him through the wood all the long way home . Binder looked from one boy to the other and saw the truth of it , the truth she had tried to make him see from the beginning . Despite his amber eyes , there could be little doubt that this boy , with his pallid skin and blue-black hair , was Caitlin 's child . And the more he looked , the more Binder believed it must be his son . That hair was hers , but the cowlick and forehead , nose and chin were his own . As Grimald had grown , Binder had stubbornly ignored the boy 's peaked ears , his yellow eyes , his fox-red hair . He could not believe the boy a goblin or suspect he was some other man 's child . It was less confusing , less painful , to continue to accept him as his own . Besides , he loved the boy . Now the changelings ( for his eyes told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a height , one unmistakably goblin , the other so clearly human . The boys looked at him , the dark one waiting for him to speak , the ruddy one waiting for him to make everything right . He could not make everything right ( which for Grimald meant returning things to the way they had been a half hour ago , before Caitlin came in the door with Bram ) . But he could still speak . " Welcome  --  Bram . " He cleared his throat and began again . " Welcome home . All right  --  fish traps . First we 'll go check the fish traps , and then I suppose we had better get started building you a bed . "  | Ulfra had been mistaken about the injured wolf . Several weeks passed , and the other wolves did not come for it . As the wolf regained its strength it became harder and harder to conceal it from customers . Still worse , Lady Twixtwain refused to cross the threshold while the wolf was in residence ; so she wrote from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know Ulfra would not let the creature harm me , but I ca n't make my poor Opaline understand that it will not harm her . And I can not think of leaving her behind . It seems the only solution is for you to come to my house for our next game of cards . " Dinner at Lady Twixtwain 's ! " Ulfra 's eyes shone . She had been in bed with the measles the last time an invitation had been  | extended . The tales Tansy had brought back of painted ceilings and a glassed-in fish pond had only sharpened her disap-pointment . Now Tansy shook her head . " The wolf ca n't be left alone . You 'll have to stay home and look after him . A half-grown wolf can get into too much mischief in the workshop . " There had already been an unfortunate incident involving a ball gown decorated with plumes . The feathers gave the dress the appearance of a startled bird rising up in flight . How else , Ulfra argued , could a wolf have been expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she did not win it now . So this evening found her home alone . The wolf had denned himself in underneath the workshop sofa , there came to Ulfra , as she sat at the drawing table with her sketches , the crunching of his teeth on a bone . Since the episode of the examination suit , not a day had passed in which Ulfra had not revisited Ylfcwen 's court . These were not mere daydreams  --  they struck her imagination with a force daydreams do not have , and they stayed with her , begging to be put down in pencil , chalk , whatever was at hand . Later , she put them down in watercolors , filling sketchbook after sketchbook with vivid renderings of fabrics so delicate of pattern that they seemed to shift and shimmer beneath the eye . Page after page blossomed with gossamer silks of peacock and canary , rich brocades of ruby and emerald and silver-shot azure . Her pencil struggled to capture the intricate shape of a silver buckle before the vision fled from her mind . Then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a strange article of which she could make no sense  --  something of starched linen , laced like a corset but shaped like an archer 's quiver . Sighing , Ulfra erased , redrew a line , and began a sketch in the pattern of a gold brocade . She hoped it was not an article of underclothing . Something told her that gold brocade was just the  | thing , and more and more lately , Ulfra found herself paying attention to that something . She set the sheet aside to dry , feeling a bit guilty that she had spent the whole evening doodling , neglecting the rack of dresses that needed finishing . She cast a final glance at the sketch , wondering what the strange corsetquiver could be . The something that guided her hand chose not to inform her that it was an elvish wing case . She was about to start sewing tiny jet beads onto the bodice of a gown when the wolf growled . It was an alarm growl , and Ulfra turned to look . The wolf was at the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears were laid flat along his head . Sewing on the tiny jet beads , each no bigger than a grain of rice , promised to be tedious indeed , so Ulfra was glad enough of a reason to set them aside . She went to the window and drew back the curtain just a little so that no one in the street would notice . It had rained a little while ago . The cobblestones glistened under the light of the lamps , and the gutters of the house opposite still dripped . A few passersby , huddled against the damp , hurried on their way to late dinners . After a moment it became clear that one figure was not hurrying to dinner or anything else . He was loitering in a doorway across the street and a few doors down from the Cat 's Face . His cloak was pulled close around him against the creeping damp . The wolf had known him at once by his smell , a curious blend of boar grease and oil of bitter-orange . Unlike the wolf , Ulfra could not catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . She recognized the man by his shape : a great bear balanced on its hind legs . It was the king 's huntsman . The wolf 's growl changed to a wheedling sort of whimper . Let me out , he was plainly saying . Oh , just let me out . " It would only be trouble if I did . " She forgot to speak in  | Wolf , but by her tone of voice she made herself understood . The wolf reluctantly rested its muzzle on the sill . She wondered what the huntsman was doing here . He was n't looking in her direction ; she did n't think he knew the Cat 's Face from any other shop . If he did , he would n't be standing in the light where she could see him . Just then the door of the house opposite opened and a young man stepped out . The lamplight picked out the gleam of a silver button , a lace cuff . Though he was the shorter and slighter , this other man managed to be commanding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the tailoring trade , one learned to notice how people carried themselves . This man carried himself like a nobleman . ( Though sometimes one could n't tell : There was a wellborn customer of theirs who bore himself as though bound for the gallows and another , a reformed highwayman , who carried himself as though he were destined to wear the crown . ) A sudden gust of wind worried and tugged at the young man 's cloak , and Ulfra saw a flash of purple silk . The sumptuary laws decreed that only those of royal blood could wear purple . So he carries himself like a prince for good reason , she thought . Lady Twixtwain had told them tales of the crown prince , how he had made a double-faced cloak that he could turn inside out and so go unnoticed when visiting his mistress , " an  --  unpedigreed woman , shall we say ? " The prince had recently become betrothed to a suitable princess , well dowered , sufficiently pretty , and moderately clever . The commission of his wedding clothes was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitors . " And there are some , " Lady Twixtwain had said , " who would gladly sew themselves into the linings of his clothes , if they could manage it . " At that point , Tansy had abruptly sent Ulfra to buy thread , so she had been unable to satisfy her curiosity on the matter of the prince 's clothes and their interesting linings . Prince and huntsman moved off down the street . Ulfra let  | the curtain fall back into place , but did not return to the tiresome little jet beads . She stood there , absently stroking the wolf and thinking . The farmyard was strewn with the litter from a wedding . Flowers had been trampled into the sawdust , and one of the garlands to which guests had tied money and good wishes had come untied and trailed in the dirt . In one corner of the yard , the dogs fought over the tag end of a ham . Farmer Goody had said farewell to the last straggler and fled to the barn to smoke a pipe , digest his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the nuptials of his youngest daughter . Hazel had some months before grown past the pencil mark on the pantry door , the acknowledged signal that it was time for her to leave the household and make a home of her own . Happily , a love match had been arranged with the neighbors ' second son , and an hour ago the new bride , not yet sixteen , had driven off in a cart to her new life . Nix sulked . Though Hazel had been his favorite , he had not gone outside to see her off , and as she waved from the wagon , the new Mistress Brown had cried as though her heart would break . Now Nix sat alone with Mistress Goody in the kitchen , helping her clean up the remains of the wedding feast . Neither said a word , but their thoughts ran along the same lines : Nix would never grow past the notch . Mistress Goody could not be displeased at this prospect . For all his small size , Nix was sturdy and clever , unquarrelsome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had increased twelvefold since she had put Nix in charge of the eggs and butter , and as for the jam and pickles , well , they had taken off like a house afire . Nix had appeared on their doorstep out of the dusk seven years before , a strange note and a purseful of money pinned to  | his shirt . The note had been written on the back of a bill for a troupe of acrobats . " Take good and amazing care of Nix , the albino deaf-mute , " it had said . He had been six , perhaps seven years old , with odd hair as white as an old man 's and so softspoken that at first they had thought he really was mute . Farm life had made him sturdier and browner , so his milk-weed-pale hair stood out with striking whiteness . Like any boy his age , he was all elbows and knees , but for months now he had not grown any taller . It was a mystery , but then everything about Nix was a mystery . He never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When pressed , he retreated to a dumb stare . So they had not pressed him , grateful for the money that arrived at regular intervals , enough to keep him in shoes and to pay for the bonesetter when he fell from the apple tree retrieving Hazel 's cat . Z Z Dusk had fallen when Farmer Goody strode in , grimfaced . The chairs were still against the wall and the floor was invitingly bare . Wordlessly he seized his startled wife and spun her across the farmhouse floor in a country dance . " Tom ! " she protested . " Did the ale bring this on ? " " Ca n't a man  --  a newly impoverished man  --  dance with his own wife ? " " But the floor still has to be scrubbed . I ca n't leave it for Nell . She wo n't do it properly . It has to be scoured  --  people have been treading ham rind and beer into it all afternoon . " " Hush , woman . " " But I 'm out of breath . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn you . Hush , I tell you , and dance . " Nix picked himself up from his chair by the fire and went out into the farmyard . The youngest Goodys , seven-year-old Pippin and nine-year-old Jack , were upstairs sleeping the uneasy  | sleep of boys who had discovered that it was possible to consume too many sweets at one sitting . The dusky sky was already thick with stars , large and low to the earth . In the western half of the sky the world curved away to a thin crescent of purple and gold . The air was chilly and Nix wished for his woolen shirt . It had been an evening like this one , the day Ulfra had left him here . When she had picked out the Goody farm , he had thought at first that she meant to steal a pig , but a cuff on the ear had taught him otherwise . The Goodys had taken him in and raised him as one of their own . But it had not been the same . He missed life on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the wolves . For the first year after he came to them , Mistress Goody would come downstairs in the morning to find Nix curled on the floor with the dogs . When he had been Nix , the Albino DeafMute , his bed had not been a pallet of straw but a drowsing heap of wolves . Nix looked up at the sky and found the group of stars called the Greater Wolf . Ulfra had been named for its brightest star ; Nix was in the habit of wishing on it . " Please , I want to grow , " he said . " Not just past the mark on the pantry door . I want to be tall . " The wolf star shone no brighter or dimmer and stayed exactly ( as far as Nix could tell ) in the part of the sky where it had always been . It had granted a wish of his once before . He had wished to see Ulfra , and promptly the wolf star had produced her , grandly dressed , turning over crocks of jam at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized him but had not spoken to him except to buy three crocks of jam . There had been nothing of wolf left about her . Worst of all , she had overpaid for her purchase , so he thought she had lost all her sense , along with her good wolf smell .  | Still , it had shown that the wolf star granted wishes . Nix turned and started back toward the house . The lamplighter had just started his rounds , putting out the lamps . The night owls of the town had barely gone to their beds , passing in the lane the early birds , laborers and tradesmen whose day began before dawn . In the bleary half light , the baker 's boy hurried past shuttered inns and the grey , sleepy fronts of houses . His mistress would have set the loaves for a last rising before she went to bed . It was his job to put those in the oven and form the loaves for the next baking . Today was to be a busier day than usual . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make , and sweet braids , and a special holiday loaf in the shape of a crown . He rounded the corner to the street where the bakery stood and stopped short at the sight before him . Eight wolves trotted swiftly at the heels of a ninth , a great she-wolf , grizzled black and silver . They made a perfect triangle but for the back row , where there were three wolves instead of four . The baker 's boy shrank back against the wall , but the wolves took no notice of him , loping past in silence . After they had gone , the boy let himself into the bakery and set about his tasks . He was a little rattled ; though he did not burn the bread , he shaped the seedy bread into braids and the sweet bread into round loafs , instead of the other way around . The wolves reached the Sign of the Cat 's Face and sat down on the cobblestones , still in formation . The she-wolf went to the front door and scratched on it with her claws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but just loudly enough to wake the wolf inside . In a trice he was at the front door . There he sat  | back on his haunches and gave a whimper , for the door was latched and bolted . He communicated this fact through the keyhole to the she-wolf . The other wolves , overhearing , lay down to wait . One of them yawned , and was bitten on the ear by his neighbor for bad manners . The she-wolf tasted the air . By the smell of him , the lamplighter was still several blocks away . There was time . Draw the bolt with your teeth , she explained in Wolf , then press the latch with your paws . The younger wolf saw how this was possible and , after several tries , got it right . He took his spot in the fourth row , and swiftly the pack moved out of town . No human had seen them except the baker 's boy . The baker would shake her head at the seeded braid and the sweet round loaf and sell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , householders would wonder why their cats perched on the highest beams , fur on end , impervious to coaxing or saucers of milk . Tansy , when she came downstairs , assumed that she herself had left the door unbolted . Only after they realized that the wolf was missing did Ulfra find the scratches on the front door . ' Lady Twixtwain paid a visit that very afternoon . Opaline stood in the doorway uncertainly . Though the house had been well aired and the rugs beaten , there was still a faint whiff about the place that made the dog tremble . But on seeing Ulfra she overcame her fear and came inside , beating her tail against the carpet apologetically . " No , no tea , thank you , " said Lady Twixtwain . " Now the only thing I take is this water . " She held up a small , stoppered flask . " If you have a little wine Tansy rose to fetch some . " The man I see about my foot recommended it most highly , "  | said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass provided . " It purifies the blood , sweetens the breath , promotes concentration , and " ? she filled the glass the rest of the way with wine ? " improves the complexion . " " I can see it does , " said Tansy . " Your complexion is very much improved . " " But does it help your foot , Lady Twixtwain ? " asked Ulfra . Lady Twixtwain had handed the flask to her . Its label , covered with crabbed writing in brown ink , did not mention afflictions of the hands and feet . " Alas , no . I must sleep with them above my head , he says , and bathe the left in milk and the right in vinegar . " " But your right foot is not afflicted , " said Tansy . " I thought the same thing , but he set me straight . The humors in my feet have become imbalanced , you see . It is all very complicated . " " And expensive ? " " Oh , not half so expensive as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . Now , Ulfra my dear . You were going to show me the sketches you made for my dress for the masked ball . " " I have them here . " Ulfra took out her watercolor board , to which several drawings were pinned . " All . A charmer of snakes . Oh , how well you have drawn me ! And Opaline peeking out from under my skirts . " And here I am as Night , I presume ? A celestial look . See , Tansy , she has made my skirt out of a comet 's tail . Alas , I fear it would not be proper to wear in front of royalty . " Lady Twixtwain admired in turn sketches of herself as a black swan on a lily pond ( complete with embroidered frogs , dragonflies , and carp ) , an aviary ( a cage of gold wire worn over a skirt embroidered with birds ) , and the personification of a rose  --  a gown of the palest ivory silk over green hose , embroidered with crystal beads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was one of Ulfra 's doodles , a gown of layered silk in blueviolet and cloth of gold , with a strange corset-quiver affair on the back , and a strange staff topped with a jeweled orb . " Ylfcwen  --  the queen of the elves , " Ulfra said , the something of her daydreams speaking for her . " It will answer handsomely , though we will have to change the colors . I would n't want to be fined for breaking the sumptuary laws . But tell me , what is the strange apparatus on the back ? " And at once Ulfra knew . " It 's a wing case . " In her mind she was already envisioning how it might work , how a small cord , when pulled , would release the wings of stiffened gauze . " Grimald " Grimald drew further into the shadows of the shed and held his breath . The door hinge squealed and a patch of dim light slid across the earthen floor in front of his hiding place . His father 's boots strode into view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . It might as well be now . " Grimald made a face . He was sorry now that he 'd chosen this hiding place . The hollow oak down by the stream would have been better . He knew how to live in the wood . A bundle was ready under his bed . He knew how to light a fire and keep it alive . He knew where all the fish traps were , and the beehives , and the places the wood-hens laid their eggs . He and Sleeker would live by the stream . " Come on , " said his father , drawing him by one arm from his hiding place . " That 's enough of this . " Bram was at the table with Caitlin , helping with the week 's bread , when the door opened and Binder entered , steering Grimald before him . " Tell your brother you 're sorry . "  | Grimald glowered . He was not sorry and he certainly had meant it . Then he caught his mother 's eye . He mumbled something in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the shoulder . " Again , with feeling , and look at him this time . " " I 'm sorry I locked you in the cellar . " " And ? " " And I 'm sorry I put a walkingstick in your bed . " Caitlin made a face . " Oh , Grimald . " " It gets worse , " Binder said . " Go on . " " And I 'm sorry I put grubs in your porridge . " " That 's better . Now , you , say you forgive him . " Bram raised sullen eyes to Binder 's . " But I do n't , and I wo n't lie and say I do . " Grimald wriggled from his father 's grasp . " I take it back ! I 'm not sorry at all and I 'll do it again ! " The taunt was on the tip of Bram 's tongue  --  the elvish slur for goblins  --  when Bram caught a fierce glance from Caitlin . Then he thought of Ethold , and shame soured the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . Grimald , no more trips to see the Harriers ' foals . As for you , Bram , you 're as much in the wrong as he . Lights out for you early the rest of the week . " The boy 's sullen look was gone . His face wore a look of blank misery . His only pleasure was reading . " Now I want the two of you to go together and get the water and wood for tomorrow . No , Grimald , not another word . Go on . " In silence they went , Grimald abristle with suppressed fury , Bram unreadable . When they had gone , Caitlin shook her head . " I ca n't really blame either of them . Think how they must feel . All of the sudden I bring home this strange boy and expect them to behave like brothers . " " That 's just the problem . They are behaving like brothers . " " But grubs in the porridge . It has to stop . " Caitlin slashed  | the tops of the shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the outdoor oven . " What about these ? " Binder said , pointing to two smaller loaves . " Bram made them . They need a second rising . " Binder looked at one of the loaves and then picked it up to examine it closely . Carefully , he pulled the dough apart . " Oh , Badger , you 'll ruin it . He spent a lot of time getting it right . " " In a way . " He held out the halves of the unbaked loaf for her to see . Embedded in the dough were some dozen fat , white grubs . That night Grimald lay in bed and plotted his escape and fell asleep to pleasant dreams of living by the stream with Sleeker . In the other bed , across the chalk line that divided the small room in two , Bram lay awake trying to remember faces . Ethold 's was still clear in his mind , but Tomus 's and Vervain 's and even Morag 's were not so easy . He stared at the ceiling and willed himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look in on them where they slept . Grimald slept on his stomach , his breathing slow and heavy . Bram 's face was turned to the wall . She thought he was awake but let him feign sleep , going up to her own bed . Binder opened his eyes when she came in . " Go back to sleep . " " I was n't really asleep . What time is it ? " " Late . " She undid her braid swiftly and , too tired to be bothered with brushing it , got into bed with her hair loose around her shoulders . Binder reached out and looped a few strands behind her ear . " A silver one . . . " " More than one , thanks to the boys . " " And other things . " The litany went unuttered but understood : the isolation , the death of Rowan , their marriage .  | She smiled , working a dab of greenish paste into her roughened hands . " Ah  --  this is a well-worn theme . My life of ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chaste . " " Something like that . " The warmed beeswax released its scent and he breathed in the green perfume of balm and woodmint . At least the scars on her hands could be seen . " If you think my hands would n't have been callused on Chameol , then you do n't know liliana . " She blew out the candle . She never feigned sleep to deceive her husband . It was to lull herself into sleep , to turn her mind from incessant worries , that she turned her back , slowed her breathing . Since the day she had found him in the woods , Caitlin had spent sleepless nights thinking of all the ways Bram might come to harm . In secret , because she was ashamed , she had schooled herself in all the old lore of mortals released from the Otherworld . She read up on the shaking fever called elf 's dance and the ailments known together as elf 's kiss , manifested as fainting spells and fits of paralysis that came on and passed with the new moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could not shrug off were the recurring references to changeling sight , Otherworld visions manifested in childhood that led to blindness , madness , and death before the age of twelve . Binder was not asleep either . He knew she was only pretending to be , for reasons he did not like to think about . But , asleep or not , she was beside him . In seven years , they had not driven each other to madness or violence or flight . And that was balm , of a kind . Lady Twixtwain 's costume was a great success . The final color scheme was silver-and-blue brocade reversing to magenta . Ulfra had sacrificed the spring mechanisms from several mousetraps before perfecting wings that would unfurl when a hidden string was pulled . Lady Twixtwain had created a sensation . The crown prince  | himself had come over to compliment her ( " much to the chagrin of his bride-to-be " ) , and within the week a woman of any social standing could not be seen at court without a wing case . Mechanical wings were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were used instead to hide everything from illicit love letters and unfinished needlework to the emergency pair of silk hose or the secret flask of gin . Ulfra 's designs were much copied by other tailors around town , but the Cat 's Face got the lion 's share of the business in wingcases . Tansy was perplexed but uncomplaining , and gamely produced a new design on a weekly basis . They had to hire three women to handle all the work . When the house next door was vacated , they expanded into it . Amid the workmen and plasterers they stood and toasted their new good fortune with expensive wine , casting their glasses into the unfinished fireplace . " We 're rich , " Tansy said , wonderingly . " No , " said Ulfra , with an uncharacteristic giggle . " We 're extremely rich . " A workman came up to them , hair and face whitened by plaster to the aspect of an unkempt ghost . He spoke in a thick Se'enmoon accent . " Summun left this inna dur . " Tansy took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red wax . She broke the seal and scanned the letter 's contents , then sank down on the plaster-strewn floor in shock . Ulfra picked up the letter where Tansy had let it fall . Let it be known that , by royal appointment , the tailoring establishment known as the Cat 's Face , with premises in Everlasting Lane , has been awarded the commission to make the wedding clothes for His Most Serene Highness , Prince Berthold of Twinmoon . ( Details of said commission will be forthcoming from the Valet Royal. )  | The fad for wingcases had played itself out , but over the course of the next nine months , the name of the Cat 's Face became so imprinted on the fashionable mind that anything produced by their shop became a mania in its own right . First came black velvet mitts called cat's-paws ; then sheer , stiff embroidered sleeves called dragonflies ' wings , and then a fad for women to go about in blue tunics  --  the Elf-Prince look , they had called it . Meanwhile , Tansy and Ulfra worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual suit of clothes he was to be married in and a cloak with a long train , as well as his traveling clothes for the year-long pilgrimage he and his bride would undertake while the new summer palace was being con-structed.  | At the start , nine months had seemed more than ample for the work to be completed . That was before they made the acquaintance of the Valet Royal . A strict procedure had to be adhered to , sketches and patterns and embroidery designs examined , approved , and notarized ; dyes formulated and fabrics certified ; workers bonded and sworn to secrecy . There were to be two formal winter suits ( best and second-best ) , two formal summer suits ( ditto ) , five costumes for attending the theater , six different dancing costumes , and various outfits suited for sleigh riding , falconing , hunting , fencing , and sampling the hot springs at Se'enmoon . Bolts were only rolled out to impress clients ; to choose fabrics , Tansy and Ulfra referred to large ledgers . Pinned to the felt pages were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workroom where the bolts could be found , as well as which customers had garments made up in them already . This was to reduce the chance of embarrassment at balls , where a guest might find , to her chagrin , that her next-door neighbor had a dress made out of the same fabric . Ulfra let her fingers skim the surface of the fabrics , mulling over nap and color and weft and weight . There were light cambrics , soft challis , and chambray for shirts and blouses and underskirts , an ivy-green damask worked in a pattern of vines and leaves , another in pale grey with a pattern of doves and roses ; fine dimity for starched collars and sleeves ; rubbed silks tender as doeskin ; rich silk luster and delicate mescaline ; precious sarcenet and shot silk . At last she found what she was looking for : wool combed from black mountain sheep , woven with silk into a light , flexible fabric of lustrous silver-black . This Ulfra chose to make the prince 's hunting coat . She sat down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hem and sleeves : hunters on horseback and their hounds , twined with branches and leaves . The  | buttons would be horn in silver mounts : one a fox , one a boar , one a stag . Ulfra worked , unaware of Tansy 's scrutiny from across the workroom . The leopard-woman studied her former apprentice ; her apprenticeship had ended on her twenty-first birthday . She was now a master tailor , entitled to all the rights of the guild . As a birthday present , Tansy had made her a full partner in the business . " You realize , " she had told her , " that you are a very wealthy young woman . You need not remain with me to make your way in the world . " " But what else would I do ? " " Your painting , for one thing . Explore life outside this damned workroom , for another . You could be presented at court . " Ulfra had shook her head stubbornly . She had known the wild Weirdwood in winter , when it was left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court of mad King Milo and life on the road with Folderol 's band . And she wanted none of it . She wanted only to be left alone with her sketches . Tansy looked at her now and turned things over in her head . A farce was being staged in the town , playing to packed houses . It featured a girl tailor at an establishment called the Dog 's Muzzle . The prince was lampooned , too , he wore a cloak of mourning that reversed to a wedding suit . Tansy badly wanted to see it , but could not bring herself to . Lady Twixtwain urged her to go ( she herself had been three times ) , but to Tansy it seemed somehow disloyal . Ulfra sat and sketched . In a portfolio case under her mattress she kept sketches she did not show Tansy , scenes of the Weirdwood and life with Folderol 's troupe , and sketches of a boy with strange , pale eyes and a shock of unkempt hair , milkweed white . One such sketch , of this odd child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she-wolf , was tacked to the back panel of the cedar clothespress in Ulfra 's bedchamber . There she retreated  | to sleep and think , the din of hawkers ' cries and the rattle of cart wheels on cobblestones muffled by the thick woolen folds . Breathing in the mingled lavender and cedar , Ulfra would sleep , dreaming , as she had not done for years , of wolves . The clothespress featured a false bottom . Tansy might have known of its existence , but it would never occur to her to look for anything there . In the hidden cavity , Ulfra kept the relics of her past life . A small strongbox held a strange inventory : strung on a leather lace , two teeth , one from a human child and one from a wolf cub , a small velvet pouch full of large , fine pearls , a handbill , luridly illustrated , advertising " The Wolf-Girl , her Ferocious Direwolves , and the Albino Deaf-Mute " ; several large , colored spangles and dyed plumes , as from a gaudy costume , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most recent addition , a carefully folded handbill advertising The Dog 's Muzzle . Neither Caitlin nor Binder could recall exactly when the chalk line had disappeared . Apparently , a truce had been in effect for some time when , stooping to pick up a vole 's skull that had rolled under Grimald 's bed , Caitlin noticed the line had been rubbed out . It seemed not to be the act of a deliberate hand , but of feet scuffing back and forth over the disputed border . By the end of the first three months , the boys had advanced from tolerance to cautious overtures of friendship . By the end of six months , they had begun a commerce in mantis egg cases , moths , and owl pellets , and soon after that , they developed a private language , in which they traded secrets . Now they went together to visit Sleeker at the creek . As the months passed the boys grew ever more different in both looks and temperament . Grimald was more foxlike than ever , ruddy and mischievous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hot , his fancy impulsive . He could climb any tree in the Weirdwood and had once crept the length of a rotten branch to rescue a nest of owlets . His greatest joy  | was helping Binder tool a leather binding in gold leaf . It was marvelous how such a chatterbox and creature of impulse could sit still for hours on end in perfect silence . He was just learning how to stitch gathered pages together in the sewing frame . Bram was the cool one , quieter , more likely to bide his time than to act in the heat of the moment . If Grimald was the fox , them Bram was the owl : watchful , silent . Many nights he would seem to be dozing by the fire but afterward could repeat to Caitlin every word that had been spoken . When he did lose his temper , Bram was capable of a cold rage , and when he laughed ( which he did even more rarely ) , it was a sweet sound , a sound Caitlin liked to hear above every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting motionless in Caitlin 's workroom , watching her restore the vivid , gilded pictures in the margins of books . There came one day to the oak with the red door a strange figure , frail more from illness than age , his reddish hair thinning and the soles of his shoes almost worn away . His shabby coat of red and gold brocade was cinched by a stout leather belt with a heavy silver clasp . Beneath the coat his shirt was riddled with moth holes , the collar and cuffs foxed with brown stains . One ear was ragged , as if the moths had moved on to it after finishing the shirt . " Is the binder about ? " he asked . His voice was surprisingly sure and sound , as if it had been spared the forces that had ravaged the rest of him . His eyes , too , were clear and bright . " If it 's books you want bound , then I can help you , " answered Binder . Occasionally a determined customer would track him down in the Weirdwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a man of great means . " I have some scraps to sell , bits and pieces of old books , good enough for patching things up . " He opened a satchel that stank of must . Inside were sorry  | remnants that had once been books , a sad catalogue of fates : books worried by dogs or gnawed by mice , books with the boards and spines charred away to the bare cords , books swollen and splayed from lying in the rain , their pages obliterated by mildew . Oddly , none had been damaged by bookworms . Binder selected two or three books whose leaves could be used to mend other books . He also took a crudely sewn volume of scraps , thinking to make it into a practice rune book for the boys . As payment , he offered the bookman six coppers and the hospitality of their pantry . Grimald hurried down to the cellar for a pitcher of cold cider . The ragged bookman sat and ate steadily without uttering more than a sigh or grunt as Binder refilled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped his mouth carefully with his napkin ; one could guess from the state of his sleeve that this was not his usual habit . " Tell your wife she makes a good crab-apple pickle . " " Actually , I do . Thank you all the same . " Binder nodded at the stranger 's satchel . " Business any good ? " " Middling , alas , middling . " The man drained his cider mug and smiled at Grimald when the boy refilled it . " Mind you , middling is a damn sight better than business has been for years . Some of those , the burned ones , were pulled from bonfires back when a man could be flayed for reading in the wrong rune tongue . When I think what was lost . . . " " Do you know rune tongues ? You must stay and meet Cait . She 's been studying runes these last seven years . She 'll be glad of the company of someone who can speak the language , if you know what I mean . She 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flickered in the visitor 's eyes , but he shook his head . " I ca n't wait . I must see a man today on urgent business . Payment on a debt , alas . But if she will visit me in town , we might talk of runish things . Have you a pencil ? "  | Binder found paper and pencil , and the bookman labored some time with these . When he at last sat back , the paper and the man 's hands were both much begrimed with pencil lead . Beneath the smudges the sheet was covered with odd markings . The bookman rubbed his hands together . " She will understand that . I need not trouble you longer , I think . " But his eye strayed toward the pitcher of cider . " Well , if you ca n't stay for another cup , will you take a jug with you ? " The bookman protested , but the short of it was that Grimald was sent down again , returning this time with a corked jug , and the visitor went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laden with supplies . Caitlin set out on the table several bundles of smooth calfskin in blue and red and green , tiny pots of pigment from the apothecary , a new bloodstone burnisher , spools of stout thread . Binder 's eyes scanned the goods as if looking for some object he did not see , he opened his mouth and closed it again without saying anything . " What , " said Caitlin sharply , " not satisfied with all that ? Everything there is for you except the little pots of color for my work . Is n't that so , Bram ? " " Well , " said the boy , " there is this . " He drew out a small bundle , no bigger than a pencil . Binder seized it and happily undid the cloth tapes of a doeskin pouch . Inside were six new finishing tools , made to his own design by a metalworker in the town . Grimald hung back until Caitlin gave him a smile and said , " Right coat pocket . " He dug a hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold leaf . Caitlin picked up the bookman 's note , then sat down to work her way through the runes . " Who ? " She looked up , but Binder and Grimald were gone ,  | down to the binding room to try out the new tools on some scrap leather . Bram rubbed his eyes . " Pickles and cider . " " What did you say ? " " A funny man  --  all red and gold  --  with a ragged ear . " Bram pointed to the chair Caitlin was sitting in . " He sat there . I can see where he was . Da gave him pickles , and Grimald brought him cider . " Caitlin spoke calmly , though her heart was beating fast . " Come here a moment . You can tell me about the man later . Right now I want to see those poor eyes you keep rubbing . " Getting ready for bed , she told Binder about it . " Now I can see them , all the signs he showed before that I did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed his glasses and polished them before setting them out of the way on the carved headboard . " Are you so sure it 's such a bad thing ? Could n't Iiliana teach him , the way she taught you ? " She shook her head . " It is n't the same kind of sight . He was n't just seeing what could happen or what would happen . He spoke as though the bookman were still in the room  --  as if he saw him in the chair where I was sitting . " She paused , gathering words . " Some people who have been Below can see  --  auras , pres-ences  --  the way a wild animal can ' see ' a scent . These people can see traces of the Otherworld . " Binder looked at her closely , narrowing his nearsighted eyes . " You 're not telling me everything . " " I do n't know everything . " " May I have that in writing , please ? " Her reply was wordless . He was taken aback ( though not unpleasantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she banished from that room for a little while the cold shadow that was her dread .  | The Binders had another visitor before the week was out . A prosperous guild master arrived on a cold autumn morning . He was a well-fed man who had once made his living with his hands and now made it with his wits ; a man who had married late or perhaps for a second time , to judge from the ring upon his finger : A young man might buy such a thing for his bride , but not for himself , and it was not old enough to be an heirloom . All in all , thought Binder , a man much risen up in the world . He grew hopeful in the anticipation of well-paying work . But his hopes were dashed as soon as the guild master spoke . " I have a daughter of marriageable age who is , shall we say , recalcitrant . In all other matters , she is sweet-tempered , but the merest mention of matrimony turns her into a shrew . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon its finger . " 1 had been told that you sold potions , and I hoped .. . " He let his words trail off , embarrassed to be be dealing for such goods at a hermit 's hut in the middle of the Weirdwood . " I do n't handle that kind of binding , " said Binder . But you 're in luck . The spellbinder of the house is at home . " Caitlin listened to the man without sympathy . She did not go in for love potions . Compared to real feeling , they were an unsatisfactory substitute , a cheat . She only prepared them for couples who had fallen out of love with one another , and then only half-strength . When it came to love , she found the mortal mind capable of sufficient magic of its own . " Why do you think your daughter needs such a potion ? " " She will not marry . " The guild master paced the workroom , taking up a shrew 's skull and putting it down again with distaste . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A man of mine or her or the man in the moon 's choosing . She does not wish to marry . She is the elder of my two daughters . There is a legal difficulty . If she marries , she will inherit a small  | fortune from my father 's estate . She was his favorite grandchild . If she does not marry , the fortune will enrich a charity house for orphans . In either case , my younger daughter , the child of my second marriage , is dowerless , dependent on the generosity of her sister . " " You appear prosperous . I should think a dowry for your younger daughter within your means . " " Money does not make itself . I have a workshop to run , two sons to educate and set up in life . I must maintain a house in town . " " And no doubt your wife is expensive to maintain . " The guild master blustered and changed colors . " You do not see how it is . " " No , I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your elder daughter that I have a cure for . Good day . And watch your step going down . " The king 's huntsman glanced around the darkened gallery of the theater and felt beneath his coat for his dagger . The prince insisted on attending performances in disguise , even though he could command a performance at the palace when the fancy struck him . It was foolhardy , but Galt understood the impulse . After the finery of court  --  men and woman starched and laced , wigged and perfumed within an inch of their lives  --  it was something of a relief to come to this place , to feast the eyes on women whose figures had never seen a stay , their complexions florid , not from the rouge pot , but from hard work and a little too much gin . From the cheap seats there rose a ripe smell mingled with the bitter steam of the roasted chestnuts being hawked up and down the aisle . It was a barn smell , a clean stink . Galt liked it . The crown prince sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , brooding into a cup of ale . To say that he was unhappy at the prospect of his approaching marriage did not do justice to  | the prince 's mood . He was in a sour , princely sulk . His affianced bride was undeniably beautiful , of the best bloodlines , and had been schooled in all the arts deemed appropriate for a marriageable princess . She could make small talk in six languages , sing and play the harp , and draw in perspective . In short , her manners had been developed at the expense of her mind . " She is , " the prince complained in private , " incapable of having an opinion , much less expressing it . " His father-in-law had , however , formed an opinion about his daughter 's married life and had expressed it to the prince in no uncertain terms through the dowry negotiators . When their life together commenced , he expected the prince to give up many things , the chief among these being the theater " and all that attends it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mistress , Lucivia , a woman of irregular reputation , who lived in Everlasting Lane . Now the players strolled onstage , and the prince was able for the space of a few hours to forget his marital worries . The Dog 's Muzzle ; or , The Tailor 's Business was a fine bit of farce , with barbs aimed to skewer lords and ladies of fashion and the tailors who lived off them . At one point the heroine , Modesty , and her sister , Pulchritude , entered with velvet cats ' tails peeking beneath their skirts . While the audience roared , the hero , Prince Lovelorn , entered with his friend , a huntsman named Gout . The prince swore in Galt 's ear . " By all the honey in heaven above , if it is n't you , my old friend ! " Galt watched as Gout tried unsuccessfully to plead his case to Pulchritude . He grinned back at the prince uncomfortably . Beneath his leather vest Galt began to sweat . But worse was to come . The girl tailor entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were half her height . She began to give Gout advice on how to win Pulchritude 's heart , and convinced him to strip to his small clothes in order to be measured . While  | his back was turned she produced , with much winking at the stands , a " measuring tape , " and when Gout turned around again she thrashed him about the head and ears with a stout leather strap , singing , Beat a wolf , sir , wolf , sir , wolf , sir , ( Beat a wolf , sir , wolf , sir , wolf ! ) Come a day , sir , day , sir ( yes , sir ! ) , The wolf will come and beat  --  on  --  you . " The audience roared its approval . The crown prince glanced at his friend . The huntsman was tight-lipped . The incident of Ulfra and the injured wolf had , over the months , taken on a life of its own . No one seemed to remember that it had not been the huntsman himself who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . But it so happened that the playwright had been magnanimous . In the end , the thing had a happy ending , and the huntsman Gout was married off to Pulchritude . It was the girl tailor , though , who wed the prince . Modesty , wearing her cat's-tail finery , was pursued and eaten by wolves . It was , after all , a farce . When the crowd had thinned somewhat , the prince and Galt left the theater by a back door . The prince cast sidelong glances at his friend as they wound their way to the guild district and Everlasting Lane . " A nice bit of work . My sides quite ache . I had not realized my little tailor had achieved this degree of fame . " " I did not know the Dog 's Muzzle was your tailor . Anyway , whatever fame your tailor has achieved has come from her dealings with you . " " You sell yourself short , my friend . Surely her fame comes from that incident with the wolf . Ah  --  now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose to you at dice , and make up for it . Now let us quicken our steps ; ' All That Attends ' is keeping supper hot for us . " The cast of The Dog 's Muzzle trooped into a tavern , where their supper had been laid by the innkeeper . There were jugs of cream-and-black ale , smoking-hot meat pies , cheese-and-leek tart , and a boiled pudding called drunken lords . It was midnight , and the actors were in high spirits . They would sit , eating and drinking and otherwise making merry , till dawn . The part of the girl tailor was actually played by a sly-faced boy of fourteen who used the name Trammel . He strode to the head of the long table and handed to its sole occupant a purse . " Your fee , sir ! " he said , with a smart bow . It was a little too smart ; something about Lord Gobeleyn made Trammel uneasy . He did not smirk or joke with him , as he did with the others . Lord Gobeleyn was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way held the fate of all the actors in one hand . Lord Gobeleyn smiled the smallest wisp of a smile and waved a negligent hand at the repast . The company sat and fell to . Their author and benefactor did not eat , but filled and refilled his cup from the jugs of ale . Lord Gobeleyn had an otherworldly capacity for drink , known colloquially as " a goblin 's leg . " In truth , Lord Gobeleyn had not one goblin leg but two , neither of them hollow .  | Royalty can not be stuck with a pin . A prince who must be fitted with enough traveling clothes for a year-long pilgrimage must have a manikin to take his place at those fittings where the garments are stuck through with pins like some vestment from a torture chamber . A prince , of course , must have a living man-ikin . The prince 's present manikin had grown up in the palace kitchen , turning the spit , until one day all the young men of likely height and breadth had been summoned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . He must eat what the prince ate and exert himself as the prince exerted himself  --  at riding , falconry , dance , everything  --  on the theory that by living like the prince , he would keep the prince 's figure . This evening the prince was dining with his lady in Ever-  | lasting Lane . The prince 's manikin , by name of Tod , was finishing his supper by the kitchen fire , in the company of the maid . From the other room there came a loud crash and clatter of glass and metal and crockery , as though a supper tray had toppled to the floor . Gales of laughter reached the two by the kitchen fire . Lily got up , but Lucivia 's voice from the other side of the door stopped the maid with her hand on the knob . " Never mind , Lily  --  I 've got it . " The maid retook her seat . " Now , you do n't suppose the prince was exerting himself , do you ? " Lily said , all innocence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own . He removed her hand from his knee . " Hold a moment , let me finish this pie . I get measured tomorrow . " It was not Lily but the pie that undid him . That one slice , eaten by the fire , was not the culprit ; it was all the slices of pie that had come before . For , exert himself as he would , Tod could not eat pie as the prince ate it and keep the prince 's figure . The next day the Valet Royal weighed him , and he was found wanting  --  or , rather , found not wanting enough . " It 's back to turning the spit , I guess , " he told Lily . " I do n't suppose I 'll be back . " There would be another manikin ; was n't their understanding at an end ? Lily burst into angry tears . " You have another thing coming , Tod William , if you think I 'll let you exert yourself with anyone but me ! " And , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lily kept their understanding and , when it suddenly became necessary that they tie the marriage knot , Lily 's mistress made her a nice settlement . Tod was pleased with the way things turned out . The falconing thing had been all right , but he had never been keen on the dancing .  | After he had wished on the wolf star , Nix had started to grow . Within two months Nix had shot up four inches and added half again to his weight . Within six months , he had not only grown past the mark on the pantry door but past the door frame itself . He had to duck his head when Mistress Goody asked him to hand something down from the top pantry shelf . Silently he cut and hauled wood , lugged pails of water for the wash , and scoured the stables . Watching him , Mistress Goody shook her head and marveled . " Late grower , " said her husband . " Some start out runty and catch up later . Think how much of your good soup has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than her soup : magic or sheer will , maybe some of each . With a heavy heart she knelt by her blanket chest and took out a parcel of plain brown paper . Inside was a boy 's coat and a shirt of fine linen . They had arrived six months earlier , with a modest sum in silver and a dress for Mistress Goody . The coat and shirt were hopelessly small . " But yours , all the same , " she said , laying them before him . " There was always a little money , too , which we used for your care . But I saved whatever was left . It 's a nice sum and will get you settled somewhere . " Nix nodded . He raised the coat to his nose and breathed in . It smelled faintly of dust and lavender and the old cat that liked to nap in the blanket chest if it was left open . Beneath those smells rode another  --  old , familiar , but faint . Too faint . Nix let out his breath with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at him strangely . " Thanks , Mummer . " Her eyes smarted , he hardly called her by that name anymore . " I packed you a meal for the road , " she said , handing him a tin box . He nodded and added it to his pack with the clothes . The  | silver he added to his purse , which he wore around his neck beneath his shirt . Then he kissed her good-bye and left . Through the window she saw him cross the turnip patch to the field where her husband was mending the fence . " And not even one of mine ! " she said , weeping , watching them embrace , Nix now a few inches taller than her husband . So he left them not quite eight years after he came . In the most prosperous ( and therefore respectable ) quarter of the town , a house presented a demure aspect to the street . In the smaller of its two dining rooms Niccolaus , engraver and guild master , sat at the head of his breakfast table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and respectable . His two young sons , Albert and Bastian , were attacking the sausages with vigor . Columba , his daughter from his second marriage , was breakfasting on cream puffs , careful not to spoil either her gown or her artfully applied complexion . His wife Ermingrude 's delicate disposition forbade breaking her fast before suppertime . She sat at the foot of the table , sipping limeflower tea while she read a letter from her sister . The merchant frowned . " Where is Iona ? " His family looked up from their respective preoccupations and stared . Columba laughed shortly . " Where is she ever , father ? " Niccolaus waved away the servant who had stepped forward to distract him with smoked trout . " Call her again . " His wife set down her tea . " She has been summoned three times already , my lord . " Niccolaus pushed back his heavy chair , startling the small dog curled asleep beneath it . " Then I shall go myself a fourth time ! " He strode from the room . Ermingrude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to sawing sausage into the lengths that could be crammed  | into their mouths most efficiently . Columba admired her reflection in the back of her spoon , licked some stray sugar from her little finger , and smiled . Iona was in her attic bedroom , bent over a block of boxwood , the handle of a burin cradled in one hand . She wore fingerless gloves over hands ingrained with ink and covered with innumerable nicks and tiny scars in various stages of healing . Her hair was pulled indifferently back with a plain black ribbon , and the only pigment on her face was a smudge of ink where she had wiped her brow . Her lips were chapped ; she bit the lower one as she worked . From time to time , she blew wood chips from her work and held the block up to the light from the window . It was a sunny room , and pleasant , but one would not have called it clean . One wall had been covered with cork , and to this were pinned prints in various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less lay wadded in drifts under the workbench . A neglected tray held an all-but-uneaten meal  --  last night 's perhaps ; perhaps the night before 's . Under the workbench a tabby cat was picking clean the bones of a chicken wing . On the worktable beside Iona lay an apple core , so browned it might have been carved of wood . If it were , thought Niccolaus , studying the scene from the topmost stair , his elder daughter might pay some attention to it . " Iona . " She blew a final shower of wood curls from the block before looking up . " Hello , father . " She reached for her spectacles and wiped them on her smock . A look of dismay came over her features . " Oh , dear  --  have I missed dinner ? " " Not dinner . Breakfast . Tell me , what is it that so absorbs you this morning ? " Iona held up the block . Half of it , still uncarved , bore a charcoal transfer pattern ; the other half had been transformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queen upon an  | underwater throne surrounded by sea serpents and a garden of watery ferns . Iona happily pushed back a lock of hair . Her sleeves were rolled up and both elbows were black where she had leaned on the inking table . " It 's one of a series of blocks on tales from the Elder Age . When Columba and mother and I went to the sea , I visited the new water gardens to make sketches and called on an elderly gentleman in the old quarter who keeps specimens from the deep . It was the first holiday I ever really enjoyed , Papa . " " Yes . " Niccolaus sighed . Your sister told me about it . " They had been unable to get Iona to dress respectably for meals at the inn , and so had had to hire a small villa to keep her scandalous behavior from public view . He took the block from his daughter 's hand . " The work is quite good . But tell me , what use do you think it will be to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eldest son . " " I know , Father  --  that is both customary and right . I only ask to keep my small room and to be allowed to do my part to pay my keep . " " Until you marry , you mean . " Iona laughed and shook her head . " Oh , Papa ! Me , marry ? Who would have such an oddball as I am ? What man would take a wife who burns the roast because she is bent over a block of wood all the day long ? I would rock the dog in the cradle and throw my child a bone . " " Silence ! " Niccolaus brought his fist down on the table , making the tools rattle and the curls of wood jump . Iona flinched . " What  --  what have I said ? " " I will hear no more shocking nonsense ! I will not have you making a laughingstock of the family , and I will not have Col-umba 's position imperiled by your willful disobedience ! " " Willful disobedience ! Papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal or two , but that is hardly disobedience ! "  | Niccolaus held up a hand . " The fault is entirely my own . You are my firstborn child , and for many years , for lack of a son , I taught you my craft , proud to have such an apt pupil in my daughter . But it was one thing when you were eight or ten or even twelve . When you were fourteen I hoped you would turn your energies to more seemly pursuits , such as Columba has always preferred . Nothing , it seems , can make you take an interest in the impression you make on others or how you present the family face to society . " Iona flushed scarlet . " The family face ! What in hell is the family face , may I ask ? " " Here it is , profane willfulness ! Can you deny it ? " " Not willfulness , Father . Indignation ! Would you have me give up all you taught me and devote all my time to adjusting the lace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No ! I would have you marry ! " " And perhaps I will someday , when the time and the man are right . But what and who am I harming up here ? I hurt no one . " " And how is Columba supposed to marry ? She is the younger ; no respectable young woman marries before her elder sister . And what man of good name would marry into a family with such an infamous eccentric ? " Iona studied her father 's face as though something had become clear to her . " Obviously , some man of good name has asked her . Which is it , the paper merchant 's prodigal son or the not-so-young duke ? Let me see  --  which would most benefit the family ? A prosperous match ensuring a supply of fine paper at a substantial discount , or marriage to a generous patron under whose protection the house is sure to prosper ? " She sat down at her workbench and took up her block . " I see from your face that I am right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must marry so that Columba can make an advantageous match . Now I understand . "  | Niccolaus raised a hand to strike her and for a moment froze with his hand in midair . Then he took the half-carved block from her hands and cast it into the grate . Iona did not stir . " The fire went out long ago . And if it had burned , I would simply begin again . Not out of willfulness  --  but because I ca n't not do this work you taught me to love . " " It was so mortifying , Mother ! " Columba leaned toward the mirror to examine her beauty spot . Her father often marveled that the spot appeared and disappeared and was never to be seen before noon . " There she was in the high street at two o'clock in the afternoon with her hair loose , hanging on the arm of some old bearded fool . I was with friends , so of course I had to pretend I did n't know her . She did n't see me , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous black smock that flapped behind her , like some great black goose . And spectacles ! I swear I would rather be struck stone blind than be seen in the street wearing spectacles . Ca n't you say something to her ? " Ermingrude lay back upon her cushions . " Oh , she never listens to me . Only her father can get anything out of her . " Columba darted a glance at her mother in the mirror , then began to apply a rosy stain to her lips from a small gilded pot . " I only hope that Mathias does not lose all hope of me and find himself an heiress . He might marry that merchant 's daughter , the one with vulgar dimples whose father sells those gorgeous silks we saw in that shop in Thistledown Street . " " That reminds me , " said Ermingrude . " Are n't you due for a fitting today for your new gown ? We will go directly . Smuggs is done with your hair . Iona will come , too . Your father has declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Face . " Columba was not pleased and had to redraw her mouth .  | While his wife and daughters were occupied on the premises of the Cat 's Face , Niccolaus was engrossed across the street in a business transaction of great importance . " Where did you find him ? " " It does not matter where , " said the marriage broker . " He finds your terms acceptable . " " I must at least know the name of his family . " The marriage broker laughed , a low , throaty chuckle . She refilled their glasses with plum brandy , colorless , tart , and strong . As she poured , a few dark gems winked on her fingers . " Do you want a young man of spotless reputation or a young man with a fine family name ? If you must have both , it will cost you . " " So long as he is not a thief or a scoundrel . " Lucivia gazed at her customer dispassionately . " I will vouch that he is not . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of papers and signed them where Lucivia indicated . " It 's all set , then  --  he will come for his interview tomorrow at four o'clock . " " How will I know him ? " " He will know you . " " It is really going to happen , " said the prince . " What ? " Lucivia looked up from her accounts . She was seated at the window , and the morning light played on her face and hair . It was not a young face , but it was , in the prince 's experience , surpassingly beautiful . " My marriage . " The prince spoke from the bed on the other side of the room . The clothes he had worn to the theater the night before had been cleaned and pressed and lay awaiting him when he should emerge from his bath , which steamed behind a screen in front of the fire . " Well then . " Lucivia dipped her pen into the inkwell and  | bent her head over the account book . " I do n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it as their fulltime occupation . It would.be a wonder if it did not come about . " The prince sighed . " I know . It was seeing the sketches for my wedding clothes nearly complete . I wish I was at least indifferent to her . It would be preferable to finding her unbearable . " ' You have had my professional opinion on this subject before . Did n't we agree not to speak of it between ourselves ? " " We did indeed . " Rather than getting up and having his bath , the prince poured himself another cup of tea . He always postponed his bath at Lucivia 's . Bathing meant getting dressed , and getting dressed meant leaving . " I wish I could marry you ? " Lucivia threw down her pen with a laugh . " No , do n't laugh . I wish I could marry you instead ? " " As if I would have you , " she chided . " And I most heartily wish you would make my wretched wife-to-be a brilliant match with someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his hand . " Stop talking such nonsense . You are a prince and she is a princess . What could be more eminently suitable ? I am a marriage broker . With what I know , I would not be any man 's wife . Our present arrangement suits me as it is ; if you must give me up , so be it . Now , are you going to get into that bath or not ? If Rose has to lug any more water upstairs , you 'll have her to answer to . " Niccolaus watched the tall young man circle the room , scrutinizing every tapestry and silver ornament . He had not removed his hat upon entering and did not surrender his cloak . A servant , hovering expectantly , cleared his throat . The young man spoke over his shoulder . " Your servant seems to have a cough , " he remarked thoughtfully . Niccolaus waved the servant away .  | The young man stopped by the window . In the courtyard below , two women could be seen making a circuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her hair hung loose , the color called gilt-and-ashes . At one point the older woman took the younger 's elbow and spoke earnestly in her ear . The young woman pulled away , casting her eyes up to the very window where the young man stood watching . Startled , he withdrew from the window . The young woman strode from the courtyard , her arms held stiffly at her sides , fists clenched . The older woman trotted after . The young man let the curtain fall into place . " At what price ? " Niccolaus cleared his throat . " My advisers in such matters have drawn up an inventory of the proposed dowry . " He placed the document on the table between them . The young man reached over and picked it up . " ' One linen press . . . one bed with tapestry curtains . . . one ebony-and-silver clothes chest . . . one dozen silver plates and goblets . . . one small coffer of assorted books . . . silver-and-ivory dressing-table set . . . ' " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mentioned would be more than sufficient . " " Nay , sir , " said a woman 's voice , " it is not compensation enough . " In the doorway stood the young woman from the courtyard ; her hair had been tied back and her grey smock removed to show a dress of blue silk damask . Though the blue became her , someone had pinned to the neck a bit of lace frippery . With the distaste of a cat ridding itself of a bow , Iona snatched off the collar and cast it onto a chair . " No , not half compensation enough to make up for the sacrifice of saddling oneself with such a virago ! " She seized the dowry list and laughed out loud . " Oh , Father ! A cradle ! You do have great plans for this match ! " The young man looked at her with renewed interest . Niccolaus hastened to repair the damage .  | " Master Fell , allow me to present my daughter Iona and my wife , Ermingrude . " Iona nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fell instead seized it and gave it a vigorous shake , she colored deeply but recovered herself . " Master Fell of . . . ? " " Just Fell . Of no fixed abode . " He turned back to the window . The sky had opened up , and the orange trees and fountain of the courtyard were obscured by grey curtains of rain . A servant ran out into the downpour to fetch something that had been left on a stone seat . Gloves , perhaps . Niccolaus cleared his throat . " Master Fell . " The young man once again dragged his gaze from the window and gave his attention to his proposed father-in-law . Iona studied him with interest . As it was , she found him repellent only on principle , he was tall enough and broad enough in the shoulders . His nose was just shy of straight and his chin not quite square , but these flaws made him more attractive rather than less . He was clean-shaven , his light brown hair pulled back in a lock . His grey eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared on the verge of a smile without seeming to smirk . He gave the impression of one perpetually alert and pleasantly surprised by everything around him . " I hope I satisfy . " " Whether I am satisfied hardly enters into the matter , I think . It is my father you must please . I am sorry if you find me illmannered ; I was only curious to see the sort of man I am to be appended to . " There it was : a fleeting smile . " We shall get stares in the street , going about joined at the hip . " Nix walked into the town as the inns were putting up their shutters . He followed his nose until he found a place that reminded him of the Goody farm : sweet straw and clean horse  | dung . He slept that night where cart horses were stabled and drank from the animals ' trough . As he lay in the straw , Nix let the smells of the town waft over him , sorting them over in his memory , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But among all the smells of the town , hot coals and cold embers , sour beer and overcooked cabbage , soot and dishwater , fresh pig 's blood and new sawdust , horse sweat and human piss , he did not smell the one smell he was searching for . He did not smell so much as a whisker of wolf . Nix rose at dawn to look for work as a laborer . The streets were just coming to life as he walked past the taverns and inns , oblivious to the many bills and notices that plastered their sides , many overlapping and obscured by mud and whitewash . One such bill extolled the virtues of a new play , The Dog 's Muzzle . Another called all young men " of sound limb and good character , " urging them to report to the Valet Royal in order to be weighed and measured for possible work in the king 's palace . Nix saw neither . " Know anyone needs a laborer ? " he asked of a man loading barrels into a cart . " Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and guffawed at some private joke . " He means the Turtle and Rose , " said another . " It 's a tavern across from the theater in the Compass . The owner wants someone to help him hoist the wine casks and such . From the size of you , you 'll do . " Following their directions , Nix made his way to the circle known as Compass Street . The Turtle and Rose was not in the best part of town , and Nix 's purse with its silver coins was not as well hidden beneath his shirt as it ought to have been . All along the street , people apparently engaged in their own business traded winks and nods . The tavern was not yet open . Even as Nix raised his hand to knock on the shutter of the tavern , someone kicked his feet  | out from under him and threw a sack over his head . Then he saw stars , and not the kind for wishing on . He came to in an alley alongside the Turtle and Rose , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash water out the window . Nix sat and dripped , knowing without looking that the silver was gone . It might have been worse , " said a voice . " It might have been the chamber pot . " A well-groomed man stood over him , remarkable for his violet eyes , which sparkled in the dim alleyway . His clothes showed him to be a man of no small means : His coat was as black and glossy as a horse 's hide , and his immaculate cuffs gleamed in the dimness . Nix could not place the man 's accent , but he trusted him on instinct . When a gloved hand was extended , Nix took it and was hauled to his feet . " That 's a nasty gash . It should be looked to . And here is Winsom with the carriage . Will you accept the hospitality of my house ? It is some distance , but you can be better looked after there . Heaven knows , Winsom can look after a gash . " So Nix began his singular education under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived behind a high wall in a district of town where guildhalls and artisans ' workshops outnumbered houses . Here twenty-two previous Goblin Pretenders had retired in defeat , each assuming the wealth , title , and house of his predecessor . The wall presented to the street a face of bare grey stone festooned with iron spikes . This appearance led passersby to speculate about the mysterious house and its even more mysterious occupant . Such a wall bespoke vast wealth , cold splendor , vicious hounds , gargoyles on either side of the gate suggested that something worse than mastiffs awaited the unlucky trespasser . The truth was rather different . The garden side of the wall was inlaid with an intricate mosaic , nearly covered over by ivy . The mansion itself , of pale russet stone , rambled in porches and terraces down to the hot-  | houses of tousled roses and sleepy peonies . An unseen fountain burbled , from a hidden dovecote came a low cooing and the soft flutter of wings . Lord Gobeleyn sat on one of the terraces , bundled like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in slippers but in boots , in case he should be overtaken by an urge to walk in the garden before first being overtaken by an urge to get dressed . His pale , red-gold hair stood up on his head like flames ; his eyes , a violet of startling intensity , were set deep in a face that had lost some of its high color to fatigue or illness . His face was a poor-fitting mask of languor ; through the gaps one could occasionally glimpse the features beneath . His eyes especially gave him away , for they brimmed with remembered loss and everpresent pain , a keen violet sorrow . Beside him a sideboard on wheels held a silver urn the size of a small child . This contained a quantity of tea strong enough to tan a mule skin . Close at hand sat a cut-glass dish of jam . No one of his acquaintance had ever observed Lord Gobeleyn to take any more nourishment than tea . This was , of course , romantic exaggeration on the part of both admirers and detractors , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaten with brandy . A smock-clad someone appeared , short of person , round of shoulder , bland of face . Nothing of this someone 's appearance or manner , neither hair nor voice nor bearing , revealed whether this was Lord Gobeleyn 's footman , valet , or housekeeper . " Lord . " " Yes , Winsom . " " The young man is now presentable . Shall I present him ? " " Has he been fed ? " " Yes , my lord . I also took the liberty , while his clothes were drying , to avail him of some of your own , as well as a glass of the brandy . " " Then bring him to me. "  | Nix was brought before him , his recently washed hair drying in white peaks around the expertly bandaged gash . He wore some of his benefactor 's old fencing clothes : a full white shirt gathered loosely at the wrists and neck and straight black trousers tucked into high , glossy boots . As he walked out onto the terrace , Nix caught his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a difference , is it not ? Please sit by me . Will you have tea or more brandy ? " " Tea , " said Nix . " Just the thing for an insult to the skull . Winsom will attest that tea has done wonders for me . Was I a shadow of my present self when you met me , Winsom ? " " You were , sir . " " Did tea do wonders for me ? " " It did , sir . " " Most people , " said Lord Gobeleyn , filling a bowl with tea and spooning jam into it , " make the mistake of not brewing it long enough . It should steep overnight at the very least . You want it full strength . Here  --  have a swig of this and tell me what you think . " Nix took a sip and felt , in the words of Mistress Goody , his eyelashes straighten and his spine curl . " It is strong . " " Long brewing makes all the difference . Now tell me how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turtle and Rose . " Nix began his story , from the time he left the Goodys . Lord Gobeleyn raised a hand . " Begin , " he said , " at the beginning . " So Nix began again , this time with his earliest memory : a beggar and guttersnipe eating stolen bread . Through chance he had met Ulfra , who was then living at the court of mad King Milo . " When Milo went mad for good , we joined Folderol 's troupe with the wolves . And this was all right for a while , for we had  | all the geese we wanted and we were setting some gold aside . Then the contract with the wolves ran out , and we had to return them to the Weirdwood , and on the way back she left me with the Goodys . " The tea ( or those violet eyes ) had loosened Nix 's tongue ; he had never spoken so much at one stretch in his life . Lord Gobeleyn seemed to follow this disjointed narrative perfectly . He made no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tale and the heroine of The Dog 's Muzzle . " And now you have come in search of her . " Nix nodded . " So you know where she is living ? " Nix shook his head . " Well , then . I would suggest to you the following plan . The lady you describe has some means , for she has sent you money and fine presents . In order to circulate  --  to go around in such company as she keeps  --  you must learn some things you may not have needed to know on the Goody farm , things with which I am intimately acquainted . I would be happy to teach them to you and to take you to such places as she is likely to be . " This was a kingdom unknown to Nix . " Where is that ? " Lord Gobeleyn shrugged expressively . " The court , the theater , the baths , the falcon grounds , the tailor . " " Will it take a long time to reach it ? I would like to begin at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is not far , but there is much we must do to prepare . You must first learn the language . " Nix felt his heart sink . He was clever enough to realize he was not clever enough . " What language is that ? " " Conversation . " Iona could not make Fell out , not at all . His manners were curious , to say the least . He was taciturn to the point of rudeness , and when he did speak he was so blunt  | that she wondered whether some mockery underlay his seemingly simple words . Iona suspected Fell kept his hat and gloves on when they met only to irk her and spent all their conversations gazing out the window only to test her patience . While he was not unhandsome , there was in Fell 's look nothing that strived to please . There was a subtle anticipation in his every word and gesture , as though he were prepared to fight or fly or , at any moment , turn into something else entirely , as though released from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would Fell turn into ? A prince , or a tusked beast in ermine and velvet ? Had she to choose , Iona thought she would much prefer a beast for a husband . Humming , she sketched a well-dressed beast on the back of a proof . She was so engaged when there came a knock . Iona turned from her work to see Fell ducking his head to clear the low doorway . As she followed his gaze around the room , Iona blushed , seeing as through his eyes the clothes draped over the furniture , the unemptied basin from her sponge bath , yesterday 's stockings discarded in a snarl in the middle of the floor . " I 'm sorry , " said Fell . " You are at work . " She wiped her inky hands on her smock . " That 's all right . I was going to stop in a bit anyway . I keep a little stove hidden up here so that I do n't have to bother anyone when I only want some tea . Father would never allow it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all slept . " Fell smiled . " No , if you were ever to burn anything to the ground , it would not be accidentally . Well , if you 're quite sure I wo n't bother you . . . . " He lifted the cat from the chair and sat down . She brought out the small , tabletop brazier and lit it . All the cups that did not leak had been used for mixing ink . While she was wiping out the two least objectionable , Fell picked up the heavy folder of finished prints . " May I see ? "  | Fell had already untied the cloth tapes that held the folder %hut , and Iona could only murmur her assent . He leafed through the folder , examining each print carefully , hardly noticing when she pressed the cup into his hand . He did not look up except to hold a print to the light , nor speak except to ask how a certain effect had been achieved . When he had gone through the entire folder once , he turned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , admiring a print of a warrior woman , helm on one hip , sword aloft . Iona sat in agony and watched him . At length he set the folder aside . " I asked your father 's permission to speak with you alone , but he does not know what I plan to say to you . I know you do not wish this marriage . You see me as a fortune hunter , and I can not deny it . All I can do is offer you compelling reasons why this match is in your own best interest , as well as mine . " I offer you this : marriage in name only . You will keep your own workroom and , if you so desire , a separate bedchamber . You may come and go as you wish , travel abroad as you wish . I only ask that you spend part of the year under the same roof with me . I should add that , legally , I may not share in your marriage portion unless we reside together at least six months and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first reply . " Forgive me if I seem ungrateful . This does not strike me as a happy prospect . " He bowed . " I misunderstood you . When we met , I received the strongest impression that the idea of marriage to anyone was repellant to you . " " It is , " she said uncertainly . " Then the plan I have outlined must be the least objectionable form of matrimony imaginable . You could do exactly as you pleased . " She looked at him , her eyes narrowed more out of suspicion than nearsightedness . " There are plenty of marriageable maidens  | with larger dowries and better manners than mine . Why me ? What do you get out of the bargain ? " Fell shifted his grey gaze out the window , where pigeons were fluttering and cooing among the decorative chimney pots The noise they made , rising and falling among the red-tiled roofs , was at once soothing and mournful , a sad cradle song . " When we met , you seemed so determined against the match that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it seemed to me , Iona , that your father would eventually attach you against your will to someone without my views on marriage . I suggest that you stand a better chance of happiness under the arrangement I describe . " " How gallant of you ! " He raised an eyebrow . " Is it ? When I first came up these stairs today , it was to tell you I was abandoning my suit . You seemed to have so much spirit that I doubted the arrangement would work at all . " She laughed bitterly . " Then you admit I am a shrew . " Fell shook his head . " No . You need the only thing I can not bring to the match . " " And what , may I ask , is that ? " " Love . " She had no answer . He set his cup on the dresser and rose to leave . When he was halfway to the first landing , Fell turned and called back up to her where she stood at the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . You have given her left hand a right-handed thumb . " " What ? " " The hand that is holding the sword  --  the thumb is the wrong way around . " He turned and went down the rest of the stairs . When her mortification had passed , Iona gave rein to her temper . " I would n't marry you if you were the very last man Above or Below or in All-in-Between ! "  | This did not seem to surprise her cat , who reclosed one eye and returned to a dream of plump , flightless sparrows . Iona turned and took up her own , untouched , tea . It was stone cold and tasted emphatically of ink . Fell had drunk two Cups of it without complaint . " Let 's see , now , " said the old apothecary , rummaging in a wooden box full of bits of glass and wire . " I seem to remember I got some small ones in . " Caitlin did not like to think about how the apothecary came by the secondhand spectacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parting with a last momento , at worst , from unscrupulous gave diggers . Or perhaps the old woman procured them herself , through the occasional embalming she did on the side . Easy enough to substitute plain glass for the valuable lenses  --  the embalmed tell no tales . Bram 's eyes were much worse . As the episodes of changeling sight had become more frequent , his eyesight had dimmed . He suffered from frequent headaches and had to lie down for part of each day . At last the old woman pulled a pair of spectacles from the box , spat delicately on each lens , and polished them with a filthy cloth . " You , boy  --  leave that be and come here . " Bram left the stuffed owl with its single dusty glass eye and went to Caitlin 's side . The apothecary set the spectacles on the bridge of the boy 's nose and hooked the wires over his ears . The old woman was as grimy as her tiny shop , the whorls of her fingertips ingrained with dirt , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke , sweet with beeswax and mint . Bram was fascinated by her large ears . The pendulous lobe of the left was hung with a lizard 's foot , the right with a glass owl 's eye . As her ears came into focus , he saw inside them tufts  | of grey hair . Startled , he stepped back . The apothecary cackled " Ah , he sees  --  sees how ugly I am ! " Bram grinned uncertainly back at her , glad of Caitlin 's hand on his shoulder . " What do we owe you , besides our thanks ? " The old woman waved her hand , dismissing the notion . " Just bring me some of those wood herbs you dry , next time you come . I am getting too creaky in the knees to bother with them myself . " " Done . Say thank you , Bram . " They had barely reached the corner when he burst out , " Did you see the hair in her ears ? " Caitlin smiled . " Yes , I did . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do n't think she would have minded . " " Probably not , but it 'll do you good to practice your manners . Heaven knows you do n't practice them at home . Now , I have one more call to make before we go . You can come with me or meet me back here in an hour . You have so much to see with your brand-new specs . " Bram weighed his options . He could go to the canal and watch the floating market , the brightly painted boats stacked with tubs of live turtles and wicker baskets of crabs and eels . Or he could go to the square , where the old men who idled in the tavern doorways would buy him lime punch if he beat them at checkers . Lime punch was a delicacy unknown to the Binder table . Bram was very fond of it and very good at checkers . " Where are you going ? he asked , nibbling his thumbnail . " To see a book peddler . " " Then I 'll come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an unlikely street . Caitlin was beginning to think she had mistranslated the runes when Bram spotted a shingle hanging from the uppermost story of a tall , narrow house .  | BOOKS BOUGHT &; SOLD They climbed the narrow staircase until they reached a door . A small shutter set in this at eye level was closed . Tacked below the shutter was a notice , written out in an elegant hand . BEMBO GILL , BOOKSELLER Books may be left on consignment , but the Owner reserves the right to examine them for bookworms , &c.,; before they are brought onto the premises . Sweetmeats out of wrapper , uncorked bottles ( esp . ink ) , &c.,; must be surrendered to the Owner upon entry . Live animals are to be left in the yard . ALL PIPES Must Be PUT OUT While they were reading this notice , Caitlin became aware that they were being observed through the small shutter . At once the shutter slid closed and the door was opened . The bookman peered out at them . " Master Gill ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me Bembo . No one calls me Gill , let alone Master . " " It 's Caitlin Binder . You left a note with my husband . " " Ah , yes . Come in  --  I have been expecting you  --  your huff band gave me to understand you have an interest in runes . " He turned a sharp eye on Bram . " You  --  little man . Have you got any candy in your pockets , hmm ? Peppermint whistles ? Treacle mousetraps ? Larks ' tongues ? " " I have n't even got pockets , " Bram protested . " Well , that 's all right , then . Come in , come in . And watch your step ! " They entered a maze , a room filled halfway to the rafters with books . The floor was covered in piles waist deep , through which the bookman threaded his way . Caitlin caught glimpses of heavy oaken boards set with iron bosses , slim volumes bound in creamy vellum . There were atlases that were taller than Bram , and a book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand Bembo fetched it from the glass case where it lay with other tiny volumes , none quite as small . " It 's a treatise on bees , written by a monk . This is not his smallest book ; he wrote subsequent volumes on ants , fleas , and mites . Eventually he went stone blind . " Bram turned the tiny pages , each no bigger than his thumbprint . The bees were shown life-size and , at the end of the book , there was a fold-out cutaway diagram of a hive . " A lovely thing , a lovely thing , " muttered Bembo , returning it to its glass case . " Now , will you take a little tea ? Never mind that smell  --  it 's only camphor , to keep the bookworms away . The tea is verbena , very nice verbena , at that . " He looked from Caitlin to Bram anxiously and was relieved when the offer was accepted . They emerged from the maze to find a worktable . At least , a worktable could be deduced from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers awaiting the bookman 's attention . Mismatched and mended chairs were ranged around the fire that burned in the grate .  | Bembo put the kettle on and began to scrounge around for three untracked cups with handles . " Little man , " he said over his shoulder , as he searched for spoons , " will you fill the dish with milk and put it on the floor ? I 've not been around to the fishmonger today , and the mice have been scarce of late . " A pie tin and a covered crock of milk sat on the dresser . Bram filled the dish and set it on the floor . He was immediately up to his ankles in cats : big , middling , and tiny ; tortoiseshell , smoke , marmalade , and harlequin ; a few missing bits of ears or tails ; several with extra toes . There had been no sign of the cats among the stacks of books , though Caitlin now recognized the shop 's faint oily smell to be the odor of sardines long since eaten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouse would rather eat the glue out of a bookbinding , I think , than a whole Six'moon cheddar . Have a seat  --  tea 's ready . That 's the secret to good tea , you know . Must n't let it steep too long . " The tea was scalding , fragrant , and pale green ; Caitlin sipped hers cautiously and studied their host . He did not square exactly with Binder 's description of an impoverished man selling ruined books . The bee treatise alone might have made him a rich man , but he fed his cats better than he fed himself . As if reading her thoughts , Bembo spoke . " The problem , you see , is that no one reads . In these sorry times , the purpose of a book is to show everyone else that you are rich or learned or devout or well connected . See that pile over there ? " Bembo indicated a pile of books tied in bundles ; they were all of a size , all bound in vellum . " Those do n't open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the edges . And others are just old bindings . Back when the rune tongues were banned , you could have your eyes put out for reading the wrong book . So they tore out the offending pages and sewed new ones in . That atlas ? It was used by a horse breeder to record the bloodlines of his stallions . And this , this was once a bestiary . Now it is the account ledger from a pawnbroker. "  | It seemed to Caitlin that the time had come to broach th real purpose of her visit . " What do you know of the Books of the Keepers ? " " Well , that depends , " Bembo said , without a hint of crafts ? ness . " What do you know of them ? " Caitlin was caught up short by this but soon recovered herself . " Not counting the Book of Seeing , there are four of them ; the Book of Naming , the Book of Healing , the Book of Summoning , and the Book of Changing . They were written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it was a cloister on a hill above the lost kingdom of lule . " " Go on . " Bram settled back , tucking his feet up under him and blowing on his tea contentedly . His mother told good stories , and the best ones began " Long ago , in the Elder Age .. . " Caitlin suspected she could n't tell the bookseller anything new , but resolved to leave nothing out all the same . " In the Elder Age , when this world and the Otherworld were one , Chameol was a cloister , a walled city within the royal seat of Iule . The women of the cloister were dedicated to knowledge and the Elder Arts , what we call magic . The Keepers ' task was to study the Books and guard them , for the magic they contained could be dangerous in the hands of the unwitting . Each book was protected by a powerful spell . " The Book of Naming set forth the art of calling things ? stones , beasts , herbs , winds , beings mortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound in ivory that had been carved in the shapes of fabulous beasts . It was protected by wailing runes that would bray and howl and shriek when the book was opened without permission . Its Keeper was Gudule , who is shown in later books holding a pen and inkhorn . " The Book of Healing was the grandmother of all herbals , for all those that survive today descend from it , sickly children though they are . The pattern of its binding was a knot garden ,  | planted with precious stones and set around a silver fountain . It was protected by its pictures . The hemlock on the page was deadly and the thorns and nettles could catch and sting . Edda kept it , she is always shown holding a branch of the elder tree . " The Book of Summoning taught how to use a true name to summon forth winds and water , men and beasts . In some fables from the Elder Age , the Book of Summoning is used to return wayward husbands to their wives and children . Chroniclers say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four winds and the sun and moon . Its protective magic was the loss , bit by bit , of the power of speech : The reader first began to stutter , became tongue-tied , lost his voice , and eventually turned mute . Its Keeper was Orisyn , who is shown with , or as , a wood thrush . " The last book is the Book of Changing , the art of exchanging one shape for another . Fables have survived with nonsense morals : ' It is easier to change an ass into an angel than a priest into a pin . ' It seems that changes from animate to inanimate were more difficult to pull off than wordly to otherwordly . Since the book itself could shift its shape , nothing is known of its appearance . It was said to be protected by shifting runes that could not he read or copied . Its Keeper , Thyllyln , is usually shown as a chameleon , the lizard that changes its color . The least of the arts of changing , those of stealth and disguise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knights of Chameol . " Caitlin , feeling a little parched from so much talking , drained her cup . Bembo looked at her expectantly . " Oh , do go on , please , " he said . " I 'm afraid that 's all I really know about them . I seem to have found out more what they are n't than what they are . " Bembo looked embarrassed . " I 'm sorry , I have misunderstood . Your husband told me you had been studying runes these seven years . " " So I have , with precious little to show for it . I have been  | working from an old book of incantations , pages from each of the Books bound together . But whether because the Books are not complete or because I am not initiated , the runes will not speak to me . " Bembo 's distress became acute . He bit his thumbnail and shifted in his chair as if it were acrawl with ants . " But you know  --  you must know . . . " Caitlin felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ? Tell me ! " " The Books as you described them to me are quite right Nothing wrong there . But you do understand  --  you must know ? the rune books you have been working from are only copies " Caitlin shook her head . She could not have understood him " What ? " " They are copies . They are from the Elder Age , all right , and the Keepers charmed them , but they are copies . " Seeing her face still incomprehending , Bembo bit his lip and searched the ceiling for words . He found the word he wanted and looked back at her , beaming triumphantly . " They are decoys . Fakes. "  | Bram looked anxiously from Bembo to his mother . Bembo looked at Caitlin . Caitlin 's gaze seemed transfixed by an invisible object suspended some six inches from her face . Over her features there played a range of emotions , all strong and none simple . " Fakes , " she repeated at last , trying the word gingerly on her tongue , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " said Bembo doubtfully . " I am very much afraid so , yes . " Ah . Ah . " Caitlin collapsed in laughter . Bram joined in , and then Bembo , and the three laughed for several minutes on end . Caitlin wiped mirth from her eyes . " You have just told me I have wasted seven years ' study on fakes , and yet , I feel like a new woman . How do you explain that ? " Bembo shrugged . " Now you know why you were n't getting anywhere with them . "  | Caitlin shook her head . " But it still does n't make sense . Scraps from the Books became my old guardian 's book of incantations . If they were fakes , how could she use them to perform magic ? " Bembo scratched his head thoughtfully . " The fakes had to fool magicians of no mean talent . Nonsense books , mere puzzles , would have been found out . The fakes had to be convincing . From other books of incantations that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real Books were copied over with mistakes put in and some essentials left out , a powerful cryptic spell cast over it all . Some of the spells would work , others would not . Failures would be put down to copyists ' flubs . You and many others have spent lifetimes " ? Caitlin smiled ruefully ? " trying to decipher them , with nothing to warn you that you did not have a real Book . " " So the real Books were destroyed after all . " Bembo shrugged . " Who can say ? Me , I think not . The Keepers were crafty . I think they made up those tales of their own demise and the Books being scattered . Why bother to look for something you think has been digested by bookworms ? I think they hid the Books in plain sight so that they would be sure to be found and used again . But the real books were charmed , so they could be found only by one with a pure motive . " Bembo suddenly fixed his gaze on Bram , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Speak up , boy ! No need to burst your bladder . There is a little closet at the bottom of the stairs . " Bram scampered from the room . Caitlin saw her chance . " You know so much about old books . Why ? " " So why am I so poor ? Ah , that question has been simmering in your eyes since I showed you the bee treatise , I think . " The bookseller undid one cuff and rolled up his sleeve . The length of his arm from shoulder to elbow bore an elaborate tattoo.  | Caitlin had seen the ancient pattern once before ; there was no mistaking the design . " A shape changer ! " Bembo protested , tugging his sleeve back into place . " Heavens , no . It 's nothing so honorable , I 'm afraid , a pawn mark , a sort of receipt , if you will , for my true shape . " He sighed . " I was once a  --  well , I came from a very old family , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through an unbridled love of books I became hopelessly indebted to a pawnbroker . He dealt in shapes as well as books , so to settle my debt , I pawned my true form to him Caitlin wavered between crediting and disbelieving his story . Shape shifting had fallen from common practice hundreds of years since . " I thought it was a lost art . " Bembo smiled , and his eyes shone as if with a brilliant vision . What does he see ? wondered Caitlin , and in his eyes she fancied she saw reflected the spires of his ancient city , its glittering port . " Not in my kingdom , it was n't . " It was time to go , when Bram returned , Caitlin made their apologies . As he saw them out , Bembo said thoughtfully , " Not to say , of course , that the fakes might not have a clue or two in them . Watch your step on the way down  --  the railing 's coming away from the wall . " On the long walk home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee , of an ancient king who pawned his true shape in order to own the Book of Wisdom . She told it to Bram as they reached the edge of the Weirdwood . " And so the magician granted his wish , and turned the king into a book . . . . There was nothing quite so tiresome , thought Columba as she sat on the couch of the front room of the Cat 's Face , as watching someone else buying clothes . Beside her Ermingrude  | reclined with her feet propped up , fearfully regarding the proceedings from beneath a damp compress . " All this white is giving me a miserable headache . " " We must have seen every bolt of white cloth in the thirteen kingdoms , " said Columba with a sigh . " No , " said Tansy crisply , unrolling yet another . " Only the best of them . " There were blue-whites like snow under moonlight , greenwhites like jasmine in shadow , pink-whites like the wannest rose . There were swan's-breast velvets , moth-wing muslins , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opals . Iona agonized . Columba 's boredom was palpable . She must pick something . She must decide . Anyway , you may never wear it , she told herself . She could still call the wedding off , so it hardly mattered which . " This one . " She fingered the bolt of jasmine silk . Tansy held a length of it next to Iona 's cheek and nodded . " Yes  --  this will be very nice . The color sets off the roses in your cheeks . A simple round neck , I think . And the sleeves should not be too long . Just past the elbow . " Ermingrude protested . " But her hands are so unsightly ? cover her wrists , at least . " Her hands were unsightly , scarred from the burin and ingrained with ink . Iona scowled and hid them behind her back . Tansy was firm . " You have very fine hands , long and well shaped . I get a special sort of soap from the dyer . It will get that ink out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover your elbow . " The leopard-woman jotted some measurements on a sketch . Now that the Cat 's Face was well established , Tansy saw customers without a veil . As the leopard-woman calculated the length of silk required for each of several designs , Iona studied her , trying to commit to memory as much as she could . She had that morning prepared a new block of boxwood , as soon as she  | got back home Iona meant to begin a portrait of the cat-faced tailor . Tansy caught Iona gazing at her and smiled . " No lace for you , I think . Just some roses worked in silk . And real ones in your hair . " Ermingrude could not decide on a pattern . Certainly the one that used the least silk ; but she did not want to be thought cheap . Yet it was important that Iona not outshine Columba . At last a middle-priced design was selected . Columba had to be shaken out of a reverie of her own wedding clothes : the watery , opal silk , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its own . And golden slippers for her feet . In the street Iona felt a rush of happiness : Her ordeal was over for the moment . Soon she would be home , working on her block . " I hope that silk will not make you look sallow , " said Ermingrude . " I imagine Master Fell will go through with the ceremony if it makes her look three days dead , " murmured Columba . Iona ignored this remark , but the barb had drawn blood . And at home , in the attic workroom , she stared at the paper pattern for Tansy 's portrait , unable to carve the first line in the boxwood block . Lulled by the sound of the pigeons on the rooftops , she sat and brooded on Fell 's strange proposal . Amid these thoughts there cropped up unbidden images of herself at the altar in her wedding finery . Annoyed , Iona bent over her drawing . Iona 's betrothed was across town , in his lodgings over the Turtle and Rose . He shared a rented room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always out drinking his night 's pay or sleeping it off . This suited Fell , he liked his privacy . For an extra  | penny the landlady brought meals up on a tray so that he need not eat in the tavern dining room . As lodgers went , Fell was unfailingly sober , untroublesome , cool-tempered , and thoroughly odd . His half of the small attic room was strewn with rag pickings , scraps of paper , and boxes of scrap lead . Sweeping the room out , the landlady had discovered drawings of an odd contraption under the mattress . " A what ? " asked her husband , the keeper of the Turtle . " An odd contraption . Like what you put people on , to stretch the truth out of them . " " A rack ! " The landlord laughed until he had to dab his eyes . " Ah , I 've married a madwoman . Our tenant , building a rack in the attic . Hee heel " His lady pressed her lips together in a thin line . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ! " Nix sat and stared at the objects before him . The mental concentration made the sweat stand out on his lip like nail heads . His glance strayed down to the fresh cherries on his plate , then back to the implements . He pleaded wordlessly with his inquisitors , but Lord Gobeleyn seemed engrossed with his fingernails ; Winsom , as usual , was a cipher . Nix picked up the larger of two spoons , scooped up a cherry , and conveyed it to his mouth without mishap . He managed not to choke on the pit , but then held it on his tongue , aware that something more was wanted . Lord Gobeleyn 's glance seemed to lift a fraction of an inch and fasten itself on the spoon in Nix 's hand . Nix spat the cherrystone onto the spoon and lowered it to his plate . Winsom nodded and began to clear away the discarded dishes and linens . Gobeleyn applauded and poured out the brandy , which the boy swallowed entirely . When Wisom had left the room , Lord Gobeleyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must admit I feared for you , my boy , that fourth course , before the second soup . Stouter men that you have fallen to fish in jelly . " Nix rose from the table on unsteady legs . He collapsed into a chair with a second brandy . At length he opened his eyes and nodded curtly , as though to his executioner . Lord Gobeleyn hesitated . " We can continue tomorrow . . . " " No ! I 'm ready . " " All right , then . " Lord Gobeleyn poured himself a brandy and studied the ceiling for a moment . " A woman drops her fan . Do you pick it up ? " " Yes , but I do n't return it to her hand . That would mean I was consenting to a tryst . I place it where she can see it , say , on a table . Unless her husband is watching , in which case I leave it where it is . " " Good . Now , suppose you do want to accept her offer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fan and return it to her later . " " Any exceptions ? " " The queen or her chief lady-in-waiting . In that case , I leave the fan where it is and show up for the tryst . " " Good . " " But Gobeleyn , what if I do n't want to ? " " Have a tryst ? Well , in that case there are only two courses of action available to you . Under the influence of wine , you may pretend to fall asleep . Or assume a degree of innocence that suggests you have n't the slightest idea what she expects of you . Neither strategy , I should caution you , is foolproof . If a fan should fall at your feet , do n't scruple too much before you pick it up . " Nix yawned widely . " Go on . Duels . .. " But Lord Gobeleyn had not outlined the first problem when his pupil gave out a faint snore . Winsom returned for the table linen and paused to remove the glass from Nix 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Gobeleyn studied Nix thoughtfully . " No luck tracing this mysterious wolf-girl of his ? " " No , my lord . " " It is too bad , you know . I begin to think I was wrong about the source of her money . Perhaps she is dead of consumption or drink or languishing in a brothel . " " It strikes me , my lord , from his description of her , that she is rather resourceful enough to have escaped that fate . " Lord Gobeleyn smiled . " As usual , Winsom , you are full of abundant good sense . Of course she is , and he will find her . Love will have its lovers . And I shall do my part to keep him from the arms of ladies-in-waiting , even if I have to pick up all the dropped fans in the thirteen kingdoms to do it . " " I am sure you are equal to the task , my lord . " " Sometimes , Winsom , I suspect you of making remarks at my expense . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Good night . Leave the brandy . " " Madam , I told him you were otherwise engaged , but he would not wait ! " Rose  --  successor to the departed Lily , now Mistress Tod William  --  looked daggers over one shoulder . A pale young man stood behind her in a state of barely concealed agitation , running his slender fingers ceaselessly around the brim of his hat . Lucivia pulled her silken wrapper more closely about her and shut the door to her inner bedchamber . " It 's all right , Rose , you may go . Bring up some hot wine . " She turned to her visitor . " Unless you 'd rather have something stronger ? " The young man turned and shook his head . It was Fell . The door closed after Rose , but Fell waited until he heard her making noise in the scullery below to speak . " Are we alone ? "  | " If I am alone at this hour I am usually up working . It is all right ; he sleeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , tell me . What brings you here , with such a look ? " Fell was all smooth composure . " I ca n't go through with it . " She made a face of sympathy and disappointment . " Is there something about the bride or her situation that does not meet your expectations ? " " No . Everything about her and her situation is as you told me it would be . It 's just that ? " Here the composure faltered , and Fell drew a ragged breath . " I find myself unequal . " Lucivia smiled . " Nonsense . Never were two more alike , more equal , than you and Iona . These are mere jitters . " Fell shook his head , a little angry . " I see nothing to joke about . " " I was not joking . " " She should not have her affections , her heart , her very life trifled with . It is too much ? " He broke off . Rose had entered with the hot wine . When her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fell opened his mouth to continue , but Lucivia held up a hand . " Drink your wine first . It is late , and I fear you have come through the streets in foul weather . Think carefully , I urge you . Are you really so ready to relinquish your suit ? " " I do not see what choice I have . " " Are you so willing to go back on our contract ? " Fell 's spine stiffened and he set his wine down cautiously . He laughed shortly . " You would not hold me to it ! Not with what I know about you . " " Oh , I most certainly would . What you know about me is nothing to who I know . You swore to fulfill a solemn promise . If I release you from our bargain , it will cost you the advance in silver upon the dowry . If I were in your shoes , I should not find it an attractive prospect . Besides , my sweet , where is the hardship  | in it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She could not resist a final needling . " All you have to do is be a man . " This final insult was too much . Fell pushed past her out of the room , bowling over Rose , who was engaged in a useless rearrangement of the hall linen chest . In his haste Fell had knocked the wine cup from Lucivia 's hand , and the contents had splashed upon her silk wrapper . She gave a hoarse shout of frustration . " Love ? " called the prince from the inner room . Instantly she snatched up the paper knife from the writing table by the window and was upon the floor . The shaft of a paper knife protruded between her ribcage and armpit , and a ghastly stain spread pinkly over her heart , smelling faintly of cloves . Such was the sight that met the prince 's eyes as he entered from the bedchamber . With an oath he knelt and slipped an arm beneath her to raise her . She opened one eye , and with a shout of fright he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawned across his face like a black eye . " Damn you , Lucy ! " She clutched herself , shaking with mirth . " Oh , I have banged my elbow , and now I shall break a rib laughing ! Darling , you looked so sweet . Really , are you very angry with me ? How could I resist such an opportunity ? My best silk wrapper is ruined . I might at least get a smile out of it . " A frightened Rose peeked in at the door , but an oath from the prince sent her scurrying out again . Lucivia put off the stained wrapper , and stood by the fire in nothing but a moth-wing muslin gown . " Will you get me my other wrapper ? " " Certainly not . " She made a face and crossed to the inner room . As she passed , he caught her by the arm and pulled her back into a kiss .  | " Fiend , " she murmured . His reply was the barest exhalation : " Witch . " Rose had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own Matthias , who related it to his cousin Lam at the tavern , who told it to his mistress , who waited upon Lady Littlefoot , who told it to the ostler , who told it to his ladylove , who was Columba 's own maid , who told it to the to the housekeeper as they were counting out the linens purchased for the wedding feast . " Even with the dowry what it is , he wo n't have her . They say he wanted more money to go through with it . " " Well , it does n't surprise me . After the first mistress died , the master let her run wild . She was indulged something awful . Once grown , it 's hard to bring such a creature to heel . You can comb her hair and put her in a nice gown , but that does n't give her nice ways . " Unknown to them , Iona had curled up in the window seat of her favorite alcove , the arras pulled across it for privacy . Her book had slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . When the last napkin had been counted , the two servants moved away . Iona pulled back the curtain , dizzy and sick to her stomach . She stood , uncertain where to go , wishing she could vanish on the spot and never have to see any inmate of that house again . Then she began to get very , very angry . A quarter of an hour later , she had put on her black cloak and packed a bag with her tools , any jewelry she could sell , all her money . Once out of sight of the house , she had soot to smear her face , wax to black out one tooth . She would go about as a beggar woman . She came down from her attic room and met Ermingrude in the hall . " Why on earth have you got your cloak on indoors ? "  | " I  --  I 'm going out to make sketches . " " Well , you 'll have to make them later . Your bethrothed has paid you a visit . " Iona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , dearest , will you let us alone a little ? The wedding is so soon and we have spent so little time in one another 's company , that I fear he will seem a stranger to me on my wedding night . Will you give us half an hour alone ? " This seemed to Ermingrude a very pretty sentiment , and she assented . Fell was shown to the same room overlooking the courtyard where he had first been received . Iona was seated by the window , looking uncommonly pretty . Her temper had put her in a high color , her ash-gold hair lay in charming disorder about her shoulders , and an unaccustomed brightness lit her eyes . Fell had brought a posy of geraniums picked from the window boxes of the Turtle and Rose . Iona held them to her nose and inhaled their spicy fragrance and smiled in a way Fell found disquieting . " Rumors have reached me about a certain business arrangement concerning myself , " she said . Fell swore under his breath . " The damn maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She rose and began to pace the room . Fell picked up the discarded posy and idly plucked the flowers from their stems . Petals began to pattern the carpet . " You are not in a state of mind to credit what I say . " " I 'll thank you not to speculate on my state of mind . " " Your state of mind is closer to my own than you might think . " " Do I really seem such an idiot to you ? Did you think I would not learn that you had been bribed to marry me ? " Fell sighed . " My dear , you scruple too much . What else is marriage ? What else is a dowry ? What else is the entire ridiculous custom but bribery , deceit , and civilized indentureship ? "  | " Do n't make fun of me . I suppose this woman , this marriage broker , is your mistress . " Fell began to laugh in a way that made Iona regret her words . Her composure broke , and in her anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he was . When the storm had passed he laid the flower stems upon the table . " The date is set for two weeks hence . I ca n't deny anything you have said , except to say that you have put the wrong color on it . I honestly believe this match is the best thing for each of us . " Then why did you want to be released from it ? " " I feared you might mistake my motives and take it into your head to run away . " " And if I should ? " " For one , I think the scandal would make your father wash his hands of you . There would be no coming home in a fortnight . Shall I tell you how penniless young women make their living in this town ? " Iona did not reply , but picked at her sleeve . " In any case , " Fell continued , " you would have to leave all your prints behind , and Columba would be sure to burn them out of spite . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " I know you do n't believe me , Iona , but my motives are purer than the driven snow . " " Yes , " she said , raising her head . " Why should I believe you ? " " Do n't believe me . Just trust me . " He left , and she listened as his footsteps echoed down the hall and ceased . After a time the shadows in the room lengthened , and the light from the windows began to dim . Ermingrude entered and made a small exclamation . She lit a candelabra and set it on the table next to the piles of flower stems and petals .  | In the candelight , Iona 's face showed traces of her tears Ermingrude might be languid to a fault , but she was not entirely unobservant . " Oh , dear , it has not gone well , has it ? Did you quarrel ? " Iona laughed . " Yes , you might say that . " " Well , a quarrel is a sight better than indifference , I dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , When at last the Keepers broke their centuries ' silence and spoke to Caitlin across the chasm of ages , it was in the form of a small , crimson scrap of linen . It was late , the boys long since asleep . She heard Binder go up to bed . She stretched and thought only fleetingly about joining him . She was restoring a page from an herbal , a leaf copied perhaps from the ancient Book of Healing itself . Many of the colors Caitlin used in repairing the illumination came brush-ready in small pots , already mixed with gum . Some colors , however , were left over from the dyers ' trade . For these , scraps of linen were soaked in dye again and again until saturated . Caitlin then only had to set a clothlet in a dish and add a little egg white and water to achieve the pigment . As Caitlin touched her brush to the wet clothlet in the dish and watched the color spread into the surrounding glair , she froze , and began to make a list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow buckthorn and saffron , green woodbine  --  all came in clothlets . There had been a cloth-making industry on Chameol . What if there had been a connection between the illuminators and the dyers ? She imagined chameol under siege , the Keepers persecuted . Suppose the Keepers had not fled after all , but continued to practice their arts in secret , while engaging in other trades . The women who sewed the bindings of the books could have turned  | their skill with a needle to tailoring easily enough , the illuminators and woodblock carvers might turn their talents to dyeing and printing cloth . The binders , skilled in cutting and paring leather , might have become glovers and cobblers . And the scribes themselves might have turned their pens to pattern making and the design of embroidery . Caitlin wrote out a short message and fixed it to the capsule of a pigeon 's leg . Saying a short charm against owls , she released the bird into the Weirdwood night , and with a few wing beats it was gone , bound for Chameol . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before she went up to bed . Bram was waiting for her . Wordlessly , he crawled into her arms . " Nightmare ? " He nodded . He did n't want to talk about them , usually . But now for some reason he spoke . " I dreamed Grimald was beneath the ice . . . . He was all made of glass . I could see his heart inside . And his eyes . . . " She kissed the top of his head . She wanted to tell him there was no reason to worry , that everything would be all right , that Grimald would be fine , but she could not tell him any of those things . All she said was , " Do you want to sleep with us tonight ? " He nodded and scrambled into the bed , only when he had been badly frightened did he take her up on this offer . He normally disdained it as babyish . A small creeping fear bit at her heart as she got into bed after him . He had settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that Binder was awake , watching them . In the dark his eyes glittered with some wordless mix of emotions that made her heart ache : weariness , love , regret . She leaned over their sleeping son and kissed her husband 's eyes to close them , then his pulse above his ear , and the warm spot just behind it .  | " You 'll wake him " he murmured . " Oh , he 's dead to the world . " She yawned into his shoulder . " I had to banish that look in your eyes . " " Is it gone ? " She had to admit that it was . " Then go to sleep . "  | Winter was beginning to close in on the Weirdwood . The days grew shorter , and with every passing day Bram 's sight was growing dimmer . Every afternoon Caitlin made him lie down in the dark with compresses on his eyes . To a boy whose chief pleasure came from reading , this was torture in its cruelest form , and before the first week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity on him and sat with him during the hours of his enforced blindness , trying to distract him with stories : how many brown bats were in their nets , how their mother had finally outwitted the mice who had been chewing the glue on the new bindings , by reversing a spell that eased toothache . Bram seemed to be listening , but during Grimald 's tale his hand crept up to the blindfold that bound the compresses to his eyes . Caitlin 's voice came to them sharply from the kitchen , where she was steeping herbs for compresses.  | " Bram  --  you 'll only have to wear them longer tomorrow . " He made a face and let his hand fall down to pick at the embroidery of the coverlet . " I had a dream , " he said . " About the palace . " Grimald knew which palace he meant . He sat and waited for him to go on , if he was going to . Bram hardly ever talked about life before he came to the oak with the red door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes do in the grip of a fever . " I was in the dumbwaiter , the one they put the food on . It ran between all the levels of the palace . I was in it , and it was falling very fast  --  my heart felt like it was going to come out of my mouth . Then it stopped , and the doors opened , and I was looking out at the furnace room . There were all these goblins , and the fire made all their faces sooty . Ethold was there , and I called out to him , but he did n't hear me . Then one of the other goblins heard me and turned around . He had your face . " Grimald shifted in his chair . Bram sounded serious  --  not at all like he was pulling his leg . Like he meant it , like he believed what he was saying . " Did I say anything ? " he asked , laughing uneasily . " No , I woke up right after that . " In truth , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lump of dull black ore and told him to polish it . He dutifully polished it and polished it , and at last it took on a glossy sheen and passed from gold through several other colors , until at last it became clear , a crystal heart , five-chambered . A goblin heart . But when he went to show it to Grimald , he saw that his brother 's eyes had turned filmy and white , like fish eyes . There was a hole in his chest , and he was dead . Caitlin had carried her tea to her workroom and was halfway through the cup when a pigeon arrived , carrying a letter from Chameol.  | When she had unfastened the tube and unrolled the tiny scroll she saw that the lengthy message had been written in Iiliana 's best flea's-eye script . She fetched her hand lens , a birthday present from Binder . " That 's better , " she muttered as the words sprang into view . Cait , my dear , This will not be as long a letter as I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an expedition to the northern isles . A shipwreck off the Chameol coast was raised six years ago , but the inventory of the artifacts was completed only last year . To judge from the contents of the ship 's hold , the crafts of dyer , weaver , embroiderer , cobbler , and tailor were represented upon lule . That is , if the ship was leaving port with lulian goods and not arriving with them from somewhere else . ( From the surviving documents that we have been able to decipher , it seems likely that this was so . ) One of the objects retrieved from the wreck was a waterproof money box belonging to a cloth merchant from a town in Sixmoon called Madderfields . Madderfields was the country name of a town later known as Isle-of-Praise , a possible corruption of " Iule be raised , " the last words of a famous heretic . The box contained some documents wrapped in oilskin , including receipts from dyers , weavers , and tailors . There were notes on the receipts , apparently written by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known only from a fragment found at the old library on Chameol . A network of merchants might have avoided the heretics ' pyre by conducting meetings under the guise of trade . And , as you guessed , keeping their bookmaking skills alive . Curiously , one of the receipts was from a tailor 's establishment in a town called Moorsedge  --  perhaps  | yours ? It was marked , " At the sign of the Shears , Lasting Lane . " I hope that gives you something to grab on to . I eagerly await news of further discoveries . Give my best love to Badger and the boys . I am glad the nets I sent met with your bat catchers ' approval . Many blessings , Iiliana Caitlin rolled the message and placed it in one of the tiny pigeonholes of the tiny writing desk Binder had made for her when she had despaired of finding a misplaced message from Iiliana . Just the size for a mouse scribe , it had been carved from a single piece of cherry , rubbed with beeswax till it shone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Caitlin pressed a hidden catch . A panel slid back , revealing two glass marbles , blue and green . Your witch eyes , his voice said in her brain . The words were spoken with wry affection , vinagered with impatience and something else : the fear that has wonder in it . Caitlin tried to sort out the facts she was sure of . Before the kingdom of Iule sank beneath the waves , its artisans had carried on trade with a town known as Madderfields . When lule sank , leaving only Chameol above the waves , all trade had ceased . The town of Madderfields became Isle-of-Praise , a reference not just to lule but to Chameol itself . Had a secret society of artisans kept the arts of the Keepers alive , or was she letting wishful thinking get the better of her ? But why in Moorsedge , so far from the channel that separated Chameol from the kingdoms of the near Moons ? She closed the hidden compartment and set the mouse-sized desk into a niche in the wall by the window seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did most of her letter writing at the window seat , where there were cubbyholes to hold her pen and ink and paper .  | From the window she could see that Binder had sent the boys out to do their late-day chores . Bram moved through the garden , pulling turnips from the frosty ground for the soup while , further off , Grimald gathered kindling . As she looked at Bram , a wave of cold seemed to grip her limbs and make her heart sink , as though some monstrous shadow had passed over the house , boding ill for all who lived in it . She had not lately divined with a candle and a basin , afraid of the shape the wax might take in water  --  the rune for " stone , " the rune for " dark . " Binder looked up from the book he was mending , took off his spectacles , and rubbed the bridge of his nose . " If you start for town this late , you wo n't be back tonight . " " No . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a bed for the night . " She caught his glance ; wordlessly it spoke the words his tongue shied from , the irony of her buying a bed in the town with the money he earned mending bindings . Her face burned . " It 's important . I ca n't explain ? " " No . I know . The books that are done are on the shelf , the addresses are inside . And yes , I 'll make sure he wears the com-presses . " He smiled . " I might try them myself . " With the spectacles replaced , his eyes seemed resigned and reproachful . " I 'll be back tomorrow night , " she said , frowning unconsciously . " I did n't think you would n't be . " He said it a little too quietly . " I only meant that I 'll dose you myself when I get home . " " Is that a promise ? " " A threat . . . as you should know by now . " She kissed him and was gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tub before his mistress 's fireplace , but the extravagant gold structure with dol-phin-head spouts at the palace . He soaked and he brooded , and as he soaked , his broodings began to shape themselves into a rough plan . If a manikin could stand in for him at his fittings , why not at the wedding ceremony itself ? The reluctant bridegroom sank back into a pleasant reverie of abdication , elopement , and wedded bliss in a shepherd 's hut high on some mountain meadow . Only , he could not put Lucivia 's face on the shepherdess . When he conjured the shepherdess in his mind , she had a simple , vacant look , and when he succeeded in calling Lucivia to mind , she was not in the neat little hut but at her table by the window , doing accounts . The Valet Royal entered carrying a robe . Pages followed , bearing linen , hose , and the royal smallclothes . " Highness , the tailor awaits . " The prince was most curious to meet his tailor . All the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the early fittings on the manikin . She was nothing like the hellion of The Dog 's Muzzle , this serious young woman , stoic in her deep blue smock . She was accompanied by a veiled woman . He nodded at her , indicating his permission to remove the veil , but the odd figure only nodded back at him in a disconcerting fashion . The Valet Royal stepped forward and whispered in the prince 's ear . " Oh , well , then , " said the prince , as he crimsoned to the ears , " in that case , she may remain veiled . " Only the king 's wedding suit itself remained to be completed , and this had progressed to the point at which it must be fitted to the prince 's own person . In any case , the royal manikin still had not been replaced . The prince hated finery , or at least the silliness in it . His own clothes were invariably dark and plain . The only concession  | to sumptuosity that he made was the purple lining of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the nuptial suit , basted together , was eased over the royal head . No one noticed the note to the embroiderers pinned to one sleeve . The heavy blue silk was covered all over with stars in gold thread . The sleeves were not ridiculously large , nor was the skirt of the tunic overpleated . " Golden hose ? " asked the Valet Royal . " Blue , " replied the tailor . " Ah . Yes . Simplicity itself . " The prince regarded his reflection as the tailor made adjustments to the sleeves . He did not look like himself , but every-one  --  his father , his friend , his mistress  --  told him that this was what he must be . " For the ceremony itself there is a cloak with a train . We brought a sketch and a swatch with the embroidery . Your highness will see it is white velvet embroidered with suns and comets . It reverses to royal blue . " The Valet Royal held his breath and the pages looked at their feet . The prince himself cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew of the reversible cloak the prince wore when visiting his mistress , but no one spoke of it . The girl did not appear to mean any disrespect . His look seemed to discomfit her . " The blue side is impervious to rain , " she explained . " Ah , " said the prince . " And at the collar . . . ? " said the Valet Royal . " Properly , nothing . Perhaps a bit of ermine . " Ulfra cast a sidelong glance at the prince to see if she had overstepped . The prince only nodded absently . " Are you through ? Can I  --  can we  --  get out of this thing now ? " It was then that the only pin , the one in the note to the embroiderers on the sleeve , scratched the prince 's arm . The pages and Valet Royal and tailor stood in appalled  | silence . The prince swore mildly and seized the nearest cloth to swab the blood beading the length of the scratch . " Red after all , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway . " Ah , Galt . We 've managed to cut ourselves on a pin . " It was only then that the king 's huntsman saw the tailor . As their eyes met , Ulfra saw the silver wolf pelt fastened around Galt 's shoulders . He waited for a glancing blow from some sharp , wickcd shears or at least a tongue lashing . But she said nothing . The dangerous brightness in her eyes suddenly welled up as tears " My lord , you must forgive me , " she whispered to the princr and , turning , fled from the room . With a gesture of his hand , the prince dismissed the Valrt Royal and the assorted pages . " Stay , " he said to the leopard woman . " She meant no insult , my lord prince . " The slightly lisping voice that issued from behind the veil unnerved the prince . " Your huntsman wears a wolf skin . My young partner has an abiding kinship with that animal . To her , the sight of a wolf skin is abhorrent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better explanation without betraying a trust . Now I must go to her . " When they were alone , the prince clutched his arm and stared at his friend in amazement . " Galt ! Either our eyes deceive us , or you 're nursing something of a passion for our tailor . Oh , I see I have salted a wound . Come , I 'll make it up to you , in pints . " Lord Gobeleyn was unwell . Winsom ministered to him , bringing him an egg beaten in brandy and possets of sweet woodruff . When Winsom rubbed a strong-smelling ointment into his chest and Lord Gobeleyn did not protest , Nix knew his benefactor was very ill indeed .  | Nix hovered anxiously until Winsom banished him to the other end of the house , where he made faces in the hall of mirrors rind practiced his dance steps with the fencing dummy . At last he carried the dummy back to the fencing salon and hung it on its hook . Giving his dancing partner a parting kiss , he set to with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust from his sword gored the headless torso , and Nix stood transfixed , watching the sawdust trickle down onto the highly polished floor . The sight and smell of the sawdust had recalled to Nix his days among Folderol 's troupe and the sawdust put down in the ring , woody , sweet , and sharp . Other memories came flooding back : counting out their stolen gold , Ulfra letting him have the wishbone from the roast goose , sleeping in the crook of her arm upon a bed of wolves , Ulfra singing to him in Wolf under her breath . Nix licked the sweat from his upper lip and replaced the foil in the rack on the far wall . His hand trembled slightly , and his knees seemed about to go out from under him . As he passed through the hall he glanced at a clock face and saw that he had spent not one hour in the fencing salon but three . Nix was suddenly aware of a ravening hunger . He called out , but no one appeared . Winsom was still with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winsom 's pantry , a plot of holy ground some twelve paces by eight that even Lord Gobeleyn himself dared not violate . The pantry was small and serenely ordered , the crockery and copper and knives cunningly arranged and gleaming . On an upright wooden chair beside the only window lay a long letter in a language Nix did not know . Nix cut himself some cold meat and ate it where he stood , with the single-mindedness of one who is starving . But as his hunger ebbed , his restlessness returned . He could not stand to remember , or think or feel . And he was afraid  --  afraid he would never find Ulfra , afraid Lord Gobeleyn would die . So he must not feel , he must not think . He would go to the Turtle and Rose .  | The Cat 's Face had been recently refurbished and now boasted an elaborate room for greeting clients . Tansy led her visitor instead to the small sitting room still favored for privacy and comfort . A fire burned in the grate to keep the autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep chair . Tansy listened intently as Caitlin explained about the Books and the Keepers and the shipwreck off the coast of Chameol , interrupting her only once to get up and nudge the fire when it fell into a slumber . " You see , " Caitlin said , " I believe that these Keepers scattered , but kept their book arts alive by working as tailors . And the papers found in the shipwreck seem to point to Everlasting Lane . " Tansy retook her seat upon the sofa . " Well , there had been a tailor on this spot as long as anyone can remember . This whole district was once called Tailor 's Nine . We are the only surviving establishment . " " Have you come across any old documents  --  letters , ledgers ? Anything at all ? " " There are some old pattern books . All patterns and client measurements are written in tailor 's code , to keep trade secrets . But these are different . They seem to be written in runes , though I know only a smattering of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are curiosities , really  --  we leave them because they give a sense of history to the place , but it would be hard to remove them even if we wanted to  --  they are chained to the workroom wall . " " May I see them ? " " Of course . " The ground floor of the Cat 's Face was deserted . To celebrate the occasion of the all-important royal fitting , Tansy had given all the workers a bonus and the day off . The workroom was a place of cheerful disorder , bright with bolts of fabric , its walls covered with Ulfra 's sketches for current commissions , and pop-  | ulated by headless muslin-and-sawdust torsos in various states of undress . While the room seemed alive with color and industry , it was also unmistakably old  --  very , very old . Its age radiated from the flagstone tiles beneath Caitlin 's feet , from the massive beams of the half-timbered ceiling , from the far wall of dark , smooth stone . " The latest renovations to the room are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last owner that the oldest things in it are that low counter over against the wall and this smoothing iron , what we call a goose , after the way the handle curves . The books are over here . " She led Caitlin to the far wall . This was of dark grey stone , worn smooth as glass . Half its length was fitted with wooden drawers and bins that held buttons , ribbon , thread , and such . The rest of the wall was given over to the shelves that held the pattern books . Six of these were obviously older than the rest , massive volumes bound in oak boards fastened with iron clasps . Each was chained to an iron ring in the original wall . A low trestle lay against the wall to help in consulting the heavy pattern books . Upon this Tansy laid open one of the old books . " We never have been able to make sense of the runes , though it 's become a sort of rite of passage in the trade , when the apprentices become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runes say . " " How would anyone know the difference ? " " Legend has it that when the runes are translated , a fabulous treasure will appear . The apprentice first makes a wish , then opens the book and points to a passage while blindfolded . Then the blindfold is removed and the apprentice must try to translate the passage she has pointed to . " Tansy smiled at her visitor . " Would you like to have a try ? " " I would very much indeed . Do I have to be blindfolded , or can I just close my eyes ? "  | " You know as much as I do about it  --  no one has ever succeeded in disclosing a treasure . " Caitlin covered her eyes with one hand and brought the index finger of the other down in a slow spiral onto the open pattern book . She opened her eyes . The page was crabbed with runes that she recognized as numbers , with occasional words in between . " They are only measurements , after all , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist , here is shoulder , here is elbow . The spot where my finger came down says ' Waist , eleven ; neck , twenty-three ; elbow , nineteen , shoulder , six . ' " Tansy laughed and shook her head . " But those are nonsense measurements ! A neck twice as much around as a waist . " Caitlin looked at the page more closely . The passage on which her finger had landed was repeated several other places on the same page . She flipped forward and backward in the book and found the passage appeared again . An apprentice picking a passage at random was likelier than not to hit upon the nonsense measurements . But why ? She copied down the passage and closed the book . " Thank you . I believe I may have found what I have been seeking , if I can only make meaning of it . Now , let us tend to your patient . " Caitlin might have remembered Ulfra as the wild wolf-girl she had encountered many years ago at the court of the boyking Milo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in her bed . The covers had been thrown back violently . Wherever she had gone , she had gone in her nightclothes  --  her robe still lay upon the end of the bed . " Does she walk in her sleep ? " Caitlin asked . " No  --  but in extremes of fatigue or distress she sometimes goes off and hides . I do n't look for her . There is something animal in it  --  she dens herself up to tend to her wounds , and I let her . "  | Ulfra was asleep in the cedar clothespress , the contents of the strongbox scattered about . She had been working feverishly on a drawing of Nix , not as the boy she had known and cared for as a wolf might her cub , but Nix as he must be now , at thirteen or fourteen . She could not get the features right , as if her brain refused to frame them , refused to admit the passage of time , of change itself . The drawing lay crumpled beneath her now as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting costume and rode a dappled grey through a dense forest . This was the Weirdwood , home to the Direwolves . Galt rode at her side , and when they reined in the mounts on the forest path , the horses put their muzzles together in a companionable nickering . From the underbrush the Direwolves watched and , when they passed , lifted their muzzles in a mournful cry . They were hunting a white hart . Ahead of them the hounds caught the scent of the quarry and broke into a run . Galt spurred his horse and called to Ulfra . As she urged her horse forward through the trees , branches snatched at the folds of her cloak . Unsnagging it , Ulfra saw that it was lined with wolf 's fur . The waving branch spooked her horse , and as it broke into a gallop she struggled to hold the reins in one hand and undo the cloak with the other . Glancing down , she saw that the toggle was made of wolf 's teeth . Ahead , the hounds had cornered their quarry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , keeping up a high , keening cry . The hart was a magnificent creature , with antlers of burnished gold and a milk-white coat that seemed to gather up all the light of the wood . From the center of the circle where the dogs had hemmed it in , the hart struck out at its tormenters with golden hooves . Galt drew his horse up beside hers and , drawing an arrow from his own quiver , fitted it in her bow . Leaning from his saddle , he set his grizzled cheek against her fair one and showed her  | how to set the bowstring in the arrow 's notch and , holding his fingers over her own , helped her hold the bow steady while she drew the arrow back . The arrow sang true to its target and struck the animal in the throat , near its massive shoulders . Blood began to spout like a ruby fountain . Not the way it really would , she thought as she slipped from her horse in the dream , but the way a painter would paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen . Its eyes rolled wildly , then fell on her : blue eyes , uncannily pale . At once the animal grew calm and laid its head meekly in her lap , as though it knew her for a friend . It was gravely wounded , Ulfra knew it would die unless she could retrieve the arrow and stanch the bleeding . As she seized the shaft of the arrow and tried to wrench it from the wound , it was suddenly not the hart 's shoulder but a man 's , though still unearthly white . She gazed down into her lap and saw the face she had not been able to draw , the face of her beloved Nix . His strange white hair was streaked with sweat and his face spattered with blood from the wound . " The spring will heal me , " he said , " if you hurry . " When he spoke , his tongue was slick with dark blood . Dread brought Ulfra 's heart to her throat . " Where is it ? You must tell me where it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the very words in her throat . She sat up and leaned her head against the cedar panels of the clothespress until her heart slowed its frantic beat . But though her breaths were less ragged , her mind was still gripped by confusion . What did the dream mean ? Was she supposed to find the spring ? Was Nix her one true love ? Or was she meant to right the wrong she had done by abandoning him at the farmhouse ? Lady Twixtwain would know what to do . Changing by feel in the fragrant clothespress , Ulfra put on thief 's black and a black  | hood to cover her hair . Since the notoriety of The Dog 's Muzzle and the success of the Cat 's Face , she could not walk the streets anymore without attracting a crowd . So the hood and thief 's clothes had gotten to be a habit when she wanted to go about her business unmolested . Besides , she knew Tansy would think this a feverish fancy and insist she stay in bed . Ulfra 's errand could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , and Tansy would be putting her feet up . It was now or never . She climbed from the bedroom window to the drainpipe , slid down the drainpipe to the street , glanced up and down the alleyway , and was gone .  | The physician was tall and gaunt , beneath his paper white complexion the blood flowed in his veins as purple as ink . He closed his bag and went to wash his hands at the basin . He enjoyed a thriving practice , for he was both skillful and discreet and did not disclose his patients ' identities or the curious natures of their ailments . Winsom stepped forward to collect the basin of dark blood and the crimsoned toweling . " When you are done , " said the physician , from where he stood at the elegant marble washstand , " I want to speak to you in the hallway . " Winsom gazed down at Lord Gobeleyn . Drained of blood , his naturally ruddy face was as white as the pillowcase beneath it , and his outflung arm black and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a vein . The faithful servant 's eyes filled with tears that could not be shed . In the hallway , the physician spoke quickly in low tones , so as not to awaken the invalid . " It is his heart . Some goblins  --  more often boys born to mortal fathers and elvish mothers  --  are born with a weakness of the heart . It is not life-threatening so long as they remain in the Otherworld . But should they venture Above , the consequences are grave . In infants and boys , the heart weakens gradually , until death is inevitable , though often masked by some other illness , such as whooping cough . In older boys and men , the course of the ailment can be slowed somewhat , by avoiding exercise and eating a spartan diet . But the onset of the weakening can only be postponed , not prevented . Once it begins , its course is rapid and severe . The only cure lies in returning immediately Below . " " That is quite impossible . " " Then he has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . I can at least make him comfortable . Rouse him every four hours and make him drink a dilute solution of this elixer . I have written out the proportions . Make sure it is well shaken before he drinks it . One of these blue vials broken under his nose will rouse him ; do the same with one of the black , and he will sleep . He should sleep comfortably enough . But be careful that he does not harm himself . He will soon cease to think or feel anything real going on about him and will live only in the past . He may have nightmares or rave in his sleep . He may ask to see people who are long dead . Humor him . " Winsom nodded dully . " Is there nothing else I can do to ease him ? " The doctor shot a glance at Winsom . " Unstop the proverbial Spring of the Dead and dip him in it ! I must go on now to attend a lying-in . " Winsom nodded and showed the man out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fevered eyes that looked up vacantly at the ceiling without focusing .  | " The boy . . . I must save the boy . . . " Winsom broke open one of the black vials , and Lord Gobcleyn sank back into unconsciousness . The Turtle and Rose was not crowded , in part because the cast of The Dog 's Muzzle was busy rehearsing a new entertainment , a masque in celebration of the prince 's approaching nuptials . In an alcove of the inn that afforded the greatest degree of privacy , Galt and the prince were savoring a jug of cream-andblack . At least , the prince was enjoying it . Galt was in a mood , and the prince knew better than to jolly him out of it , though he could not help making an observation . " Has it ever occurred to you that the reason you can not bring yourself to speak to her has nothing to do with wolves or even her wolfish ways ? " " No . But I suspect it has occurred to you . Pray " ? Galt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The prince gazed up at the rafters as if every beam were carved with words of wisdom . The ale had ever so slightly loosened his tongue , else he would have been more heedful of the gleam in Galt 's eye . " It 's that you have always surrounded yourself with a certain kind of female company not inclined to the art of conversation , and so have no conversation yourself . " Galt gave the prince a baleful glance , refilled his tankard , and pushed the jug away . " Again , " he said softly . At once the landlord was at their table . The empty jug was swiftly removed and a full one set down in its place . " And how do you know what kind of female company I keep ? " he asked when the tavern keeper had moved off to supervise the tapping of a cask of wine . " I know that you are a not-too-frequent but generous patron of the better sort of courtesan , and that you favor those who , while young and comely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galt 's mouth twisted into a ghost of a smile . " Unlike a king , a king 's huntsman can only choose so far . He must content himself with the selection available to a man of his rank and means . " The prince perceived that the conversation had passed be yond playful bandying to something else . He searched his friend 's face for a moment before he spoke , and when he did he chose his words carefully . " I begin to suspect that you believe yourself incapable of engaging a woman except through a business transaction . Or is it your own affections that fail to be engaged ? " " You mistake me , my friend . I like to leave my heart at the door in such transactions . My affections were engaged once . I did not care for it . " " I see . So the unscrupulous might slit your throat and make off with your purse , but they will never wound you here . " The prince leaned over and tapped Galt soundly on his leather breastplate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tread softly ! " The prince held up his hands , palms outward . " On cat feet , " he murmured . Galt stared into his black ale . " When I was young  --  younger than you are now  --  I married , only to discover my affections had been sadly misplaced . But my wife was so beautiful and her ways so sweet that I could not believe she was capable of deceiving me with another . One day , while hunting boar , my arrow went astray and killed the man rumor called her lover . When she heard the news she took poison . " He looked at the prince 's face and smiled . " You see , she did not believe I could miss my mark . " Three flights above this conversation , Fell was seated at the unsteady table that served alike as washstand , boot stand , and writing desk in the small , ill-furnished room . On this occasion it was a writing desk . He sat with his pen poised over the sheet ,  | biting his thumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagining the prospect as seen from Iona 's attic window , pigeons rising and falling among the ornate chimney pots . Before him on the half-filled sheet was a list . REOPENING THE HOUSE ? Air out trunk ( check for moths ) ? Candles , firewood , cat 's meat ? Wine ( Where is key to cellar ? ) ? Count linens ? Have extra set of keys made for I. ? Pawnbroker for Mother 's jewels ( Get garnet ring reset for I. ? Can this be done in three days ? ) ? Have press delivered ( Do this at night ? ) Fell turned his attention from the view to his list and began to draw on the bottom of the piece of paper . A few minutes ' sketching produced Iona in wedding clothes beside an altar covered with flowers . Then , after a pause during which he stared off into space , Fell erased the flowers . In their place he drew his own effigy in armor , stretched out on a low tomb . Then he filled in lona 's gown with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for death ( Check on dowry , arrange funeral , decide on day  --  how soon after wedding ? ) " Dusk was beginning to gather . The narrow streets , with their houses so close that a man could lean out his window and light the pipe of his neighbor next door , were sinking into an enveloping darkness , dispelled here and there by the hopeful work of lamplighters making their rounds . Through these streets Ulfra made her way , her thief 's garb allowing her to pass within feet of others unnoticed , her face hidden by the close hood .  | As it happened , Galt had veered from the route to his lodgings to persuade an apothecary just shuttering his shop to sell him a headache powder . The premises of this obliging merchant were in the same street as the button makers Ulfra had visited the day she had rescued the young wolf , and lay quite close to Lady Twixtwain 's house . Cutting through an alley to shorten his way home ( his head was pounding now , damn that last pint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door of a house in Goldenmouth Street . With the ease of one plucking a rabbit from a snare , he stepped forward and seized the housebreaker by the nape of the neck . " Let 's have a look at you , " he said . Pulling back the hood , he was astonished to find himself face to face with the prince 's female tailor . " You ! " Galt gave a stifled cry , half shout and half laugh , and released her so abruptly that Ulfra fell back on the slick cobblestones . Realizing this was not winning conduct on the part of a suitor , the huntsman hauled her to her feet and suddenly found himself holding her tightly by the wrists , mesmerized by those wolf 's eyes . It is never advisable to kiss a wolf , but that is what Galt did . Taken completely off her guard , Ulfra stood frozen with her fists clenched . When she regained her wits she found she could not shake off his grip . At last Ulfra wrenched her head to one side with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat . It was a murderous sound  --  enraged , uncanny , and not quite human . Galt released her wrists as though they were red-hot pokers . He felt as though he had been pulled from a seething cauldron only to be plunged into an icy deep : His bones sang , his eyes dimmed , and he found himself suddenly drenched with a cold sweat . She stood before him a girl again , her face damp with tears of outrage , dragging the back of her hand across her mouth . The  | wolf had receded from her eyes , leaving them indignant and confused . Her lower lip was bloodied . Galt found a handkerchief and stepped forward to press it to her lip , then placed her fingers over the bandage so that she could hold it herself . " I 'm sorry , " he said . She shook her head and removed the handkerchief to speak , trying the words out gingerly . " It happened when I turned my head . " " I 'm sorry , " he repeated . Neither of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an invisible spark to cross the gap between them . Neither knew afterward who had moved first into a kiss that tasted of blood and tears and the Turtle and Rose 's best cream-and-black . Then , with a sudden exclamation , she ducked down and out of his arms , loose-boned as a mink shrugging out of a trap . Before he realized what was happening , she was gone . What had happened was this : Just as she was about to abandon all caution , Ulfra 's hands had closed on the lining of Galt 's cloak . The prince left the Turtle and Rose and began to make his way to Everlasting Lane . He had turned from the alley into the wider street when he was nearly bowled over by a strange young man , long-limbed and impeccably dressed , except for the omission of gloves and the less-than-fashionable disarray of his collar and cuffs . Nix was winded , but between ragged breaths he gasped a hasty apology and made as if to run past . The prince , staring at him , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with new-sprung possibilities . " You are the very thing ! No , never mind , that , I 'm fine . Here , hold your arm out . "  | Nix did so , a little wonderingly , but obeying the easy corn mand in the prince 's tone . They were of a height , their shoulders an equal span , and their arms so alike that if they had been cast in bronze , one could not tell which was the model and which the copy . " If our faces were anything alike , I should begin to fear for my throne , " the prince muttered . " Instead , I begin to hope for my happiness . " The prince drew a card from his pocket , scrawled something on it , and handed it to Nix . " Present this at the palace and tell them you are to see the Valet Royal . You will be well paid for your trouble . " Lady Twixtwain saw at once how it stood with Ulfra . She had been quite surprised to discover Ulfra on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen door and a standing invitation to let herself in and make herself at home until Lady Twixtwain should emerge from any of a number of baths , naps , changes of wardrobe , and small cosmetic adjustments that made up her daily domestic routine . Taking the girl firmly in hand , she set her before the fire and gave her a clean compress for her lip , a little of her miracle tonic on a silk handkerchief that smelled faintly of scent . Ulfra haltingly related first her dream and then the encounter with Galt . Lady Twixtwain listened to the girl 's expressions of repulsion and loathing for Galt and her bitter self-recriminations with an increasingly unsympathetic ear . " My dear , " she sighed . " I beg you , do n't waste perfectly good indignation on the matter ! It is quite commonplace to love and loathe the same person by turns , and often both at once . And , if I may further shock your nice sensibilities , you can even be in love with more than one person at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking extremely ill at ease . " I ca n't believe that . "  | " Well , you ought to . It has been the way of the world since time began . You may very well hate this man with all your reason , nay , even with all your heart , but your blood may sing another tune ! Tell me the truth : Did you find his kiss loathsome ? " Ulfra stared down at the handkerchief in her hand . " Yes ! No . . . not the second time . " " From what you have just told me , I surmise a few things . You had only just discovered in this dream that you love this lost boy  --  Nix , is it ? ? and before you can come to tell me , you find yourself in the arms of the man you most loathe in the world . And now you are feeling guilty and afraid that you have been unfaithful to this Nix of yours . My dear , you are all of twentyone , and never yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to be untouched by other lips . It would be a crime against nature . It is beyond the pale . " Thinking she had perhaps taken the topic as far as was wise for the time being , Lady Twixtwain took the conversation in a different direction . " Here  --  let me have a look at that lip . " Dutifully , Ulfra removed the compress . The bleeding had stopped . Indeed , it was impossible to tell where the cut had been . " There . Did I not tell you my water works miracles ? Now kiss me , my dear , and then up to bed with you . I will send word to Tansy that you are staying with me tonight . Heaven only knows what other adventures you might have on your way home . " " I tell you , it solves everything ! " The prince spoke these words with great passion and more than a little annoyance that they seemed to carry no great persuasion for his mistress , who sighed and moved to dip her pen into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prince shoved the inkwell  | away , making a great blot on the page of accounts to which Lucivia had been devoting herself . She looked up at him with an expression of intense exasperation . " All right , that is it . I have had quite enough , thank you , for this evening . Uninvited , you present yourself during the very hours which we have agreed I am to be left to myself . You then outstay your thin welcome , bend my ear with some harebrained scheme of hiring a manikin to stand in for you at your wedding , and now you have undone an hour 's tedious accounting ! Really , I have half  --  no , three-quarters  --  of a mind to turn you out altogether . No , not a word , I am quite serious . I am tired of your peevish behavior . How can I state it more clearly than I have done ? I will not not marry you , under any circumstances ! " His eyes flashed with anger . " Do n't scruple about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , then . You do not consider it possible that I should have any business of my own that is more important than your personal and immediate gratification . Simply because you are in a mood you expect that I should cancel all other appointments , set aside important work than must be done , and devote myself to soothing your wounded self-regard . " " What other appointments at this hour , may I be allowed to know ! " Her eyes flashed . " Oh , you are most infuriating ! If a woman 's attention , let alone her affection , is not engaged entirely , heaven knows she can only be bestowing it upon some other man ! She can not possibly be engaged in business , or the running of her household , or her own thoughts ! " " That is an unkind cut , Lucy , " he said wearily . " If it is unkind , it is only because it is the truth . " She paused to catch her breath and smiled at him wryly . " Believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are too different , and ours are not the differences that complement , but those that detract . My ambition , my independence of mind , would only make you unhappy , I am utterly incapable of the sentimentality you so like to credit  | me with . You would do far better to resign yourself to the bride that I have spent so much time and energy procuring for you . " A stark and dreadful realization was beginning to take form in the prince 's fevered brain . " How can I love another , after you ? " This at last made her laugh . " But you do not love me , goose . You are in love with me , and only with the part of me that is pliant and pleasing and dresses itself in scent and silk . And that is not who I am the other sixteen hours of the day . If I were to marry , it would be to a grey old man who would allow me a good night 's sleep . " The prince stood and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as it had been before . His eyes had been opened  --  not to her true nature , which she had never concealed from him , but to his own . Her anger had passed . She looked at him with affection and reached up to lay her palm upon his heated face . " Unlace me , " she said . " I have something to show you . " When the bodice was unlaced and her back laid bare , Lucivia pulled aside her heavy tresses and revealed the mark , wine-dark and the size of his outstretched palm , that spread between her shoulder blades in the shape of a butterfly . " What do you see ? " " Your scar , " he said dully , " where your brother scalded you in the bath . " He thought he heard a note of pity in her voice , and it made him afraid . " I told you that because it was what you would believe . A discreet surgeon made that scar . Yes , I paid him to do it . Wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . There , " she said gently . " I 've told you . " She shrugged back into her bodice and turned to face him . " That is what they removed from me . Now you know what I am . If you will not heed my other reasons , you must heed that one . Go on  --  leave me . Rose will lace me up again . She is finally getting good at it , the little idiot . "  | The prince dragged his feet up the gilded staircase to his bedroom , where his page kept a sleepy vigil in case his master should make a rare appearance in his own bed before the small hours of the morning . " Will you bathe , Your Highness ? " inquired the Valet Royal No . " Have you dined ? " " No . " " Have ? " " No ! Leave me . I want nothing . " When he was alone , the prince went out onto his balcony to breathe the night air , then came back in and rummaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used , that made up part of the princely appointments of the royal bedchamber . He drew out a packet of documents and took them over to the bed to read : a series of formal letters , from his future father-in-law , and the marriage contract and its many codicils and legal appendages , on thick curling parchment much covered with red wax seals . Among all these papers there was only one short note from his appointed bride , a few lines in a girlish hand . Her accomplishments , the enclosed note told him , included not only the lute and harp , but the mastery of several languages and a decided proficiency at embroidery . With these documents there was a small ivory box set with diamonds , which , when its catch was sprung , revealed a portrait of his betrothed . She was very young , with quantities of glossy , soft brown hair caught up in a net of pearls . The painter had given her wide-set brown eyes a wet luster , this , with her slightly upturned nose and small chin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too highly strung . Three days passed , and on the eve of lona 's wedding a package arrived at a house in the most prosperous and respect-  | able quarter of the town . The servant left the enormous parcel in the hallway and went to tell the mistress of the house of its arrival . Ermingrude set down her letter and her spaniel and her bowl of tea and scurried to the hallway , exclaiming and calling for Columba to come and look , the thing had indeed come in time , and who would have expected it ? Ermingrude and Columba and the housekeeper had spent some minutes exclaiming over the workmanship of the dress and wondering how its folds could be conveyed in a carriage without crushing the delicate embroidery , when they realized the bride herself was not among them . " How like her , " murmured Columba . " If my sister is one thing , it is not vain . Shall I find her ? " " Yes , do . You would think she would think of me and be a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an unnatural child . " " I should hope so , madam , since she is not yours , " murmured Columba , gliding out the door . She found her half sister in her attic room , packing the last of her inks and tools and blocks into a special crate . Iona had removed all her prints from the walls and placed them in the special case that Fell had given her as a token of their engagement . She had thought it a little wrong of her to accept it , but she had not really known what else to do . And it had come in very handy . " How nice this place looks , now that you 've picked it all up , " said Columba , leaning in the doorway but disdaining to cross the threshold . Iona glanced around . " Really ? To me it looks rather bare . " Privately Columba thought the room could best be made into quarters for a live-in seamstress . Her own marriage was to follow Iona 's at the minimum respectable distance of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own private  | dressmaker installed at her mother 's house , working full time on her own marriage clothes . " Your dress has come at last . We were all looking at it this past half hour before we noticed you were n't with us . " Columba had to admit that she had been wrong about the silk . The jasmine white did not make Iona look sallow at all . Rather , it brought the roses out in her cheeks and made her hair glitter like gold leaf glimpsed in a dim chapel . " My dear , you are quite a vision , " said Ermingrude from the couch , where a back spasm had sent her . " Who would have imagined it ? Your father was quite right to make you eat a piece of bloody beef once a week . It has done wonders for your complexion . " Iona gazed silently at her reflection in the glass . The dress was marvelous . The cut of the bodice worked wonders , the silk clinging here , skimming there , and finally flaring below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embroidered all over with intertwined jasmine vines . The housekeeper appeared in the doorway . " This was just delivered , madam . " " This " turned out to be another parcel , addressed to Iona , bearing no return address . When the paper was removed it was revealed to be a small box of horn , carved with a motif of doves . " It looks old , " said Ermingrude , wondering if it might be valuable . " No  --  he made it himself , " Iona said softly . She had recognized the doves for pigeons , and the design on the box as the view from her own window , with its maze of chimney pots . " Open it , silly , " said Columba impatiently . " Of course , it 's your ring ! " It was a fine red stone in a setting of reddish gold that curled up around the stone like leaves of ivy .  | " It 's only a garnet , after all . He might at least have gotten you a ruby , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning the ring over in her hand . The inside of the band was engraved . She held it to the light to read the inscription . It said , " For Iona , " and nothing more .  | The vows were sworn , the marriage feast over , the guests dispersed . Good-byes were said , and the small chest containing Iona 's clothes was loaded into the carriage . As part of Iona 's dowry , her father had intended to make the couple a present of a modest house close to his own , with a dozen or so rooms . But Fell quietly insisted on a house with only eight rooms , on the fringe of the artists ' quarter . No argument move him on this point , and rather than see his daughter settled in a still less respectable part of town , Niccolaus grudgingly conceded . Fell had engaged the servants himself , claiming that he was quite particular about the management of his household . As they rode in silence through the streets of the city , it occured to Iona that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning hours of the first day of her married life .  | Fell sat with his face turned to the carriage window . She thought that perhaps he had fallen asleep . Something in the set of his shoulders bespoke a profound weariness , an intense fatigue he hid from the world when awake . Shyly Iona stretched out a hand and touched her husband 's shoulder . The carriage had stopped , and Fell stirred , from sleep or contemplation , and turned to her . His face was unreadable , but in the pale lamplight it seemed young and uncertain . He smiled at her wryly . " Your new home , madam . " In the hallway the sleepy housekeeper helped them from their cloaks . Iona glimpsed crates and trunks and furniture draped in cloths . Fell knelt to pick up a large cat that was weaving between his legs . He buried his face in its plush grey fur , and for a moment she did not recognize him , so unaccustomed was she to seeing an expression approaching tenderness on his face . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iona , seeing the draped forms of the hall through her eyes . " I thought you would want to arrange the furnishings to your own liking . " Fell turned to the housekeeper and ordered hot wine . " Bring it to madam 's bedroom . " The housekeeper led the way up the staircase . Fell paused at a different door along the passage . " I 'll join you when I 've bathed and changed . " He dropped a kiss on her cheek . Iona paused in the hallway , suddenly feeling oddly disembodied and confused . The housekeeper waited , holding the lantern aloft . Iona hurried to catch up , lifting the heavy skirts of her wedding clothes . The housekeeper showed her into a spacious room furnished with a clothespress , a writing table , and a carved bed hung with silk curtains . In an alcove , a cushioned seat looked out through leaded windows to the park below .  | " Shall I help you out of your dress , madam ? " " No  --  yes . If you would just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When the woman had gone Iona washed her face at the basin and combed out her hair . When she went to change the heavy wedding dress for her nightclothes , she found that her mother ( or possibly Columba , in a fit of spite ) had substituted for her maidenly nightdress another of diaphanous muslin that , in the candlelight , was entirely transparent . None of her other clothes had been unpacked , so Iona left her shift on . The housekeeper returned with a tray containing a jug of spiced wine and two goblets . Iona filled a goblet with a fingerful of wine and tossed it down . Her throat was parched . Unconsciously , she wiped her palms on her shift . She could not bring herself to wait on the bed , so she sat in the window seat and looked out at the park below , angry at herself for being so nervous . She had made her bargain , and now she must live by it . Columba 's taunting words about wedding nights rang in her ears and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she inhaled the cool night air . Behind her a door opened and softly closed again . Iona turned around . At first Iona thought no one was there . Then she realized the door she had heard was not the door to the hallway but the smaller door that led to an adjoining room . Beside this there stood a woman . She was tall , with features too striking to be comely on a woman . Her best features were her light brown hair and her large grey eyes . She wore an elegant silk gown of deepest blue , the dress not of a servant or relative but of the mistress of the house . Iona rose on legs that were unsteady , her mind racing from possibility to possibility as down a corridor of locked doors : This was Fell 's sister , his cousin , his mistress , his secret wife . Her mind wrestled with each possibility and weighed it against the evidence of her eyes . The awful truth dawned on her .  | This was Fell , got up in woman 's clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " said Fell , coming forward and helping her back onto the window seat . " I am sorry to give you such a shock . Would it help you to drink some wine ? " Iona looked at him in the light , and suddenly her mind made the last leap to the truth . Fell was a woman . Something rose in lona 's throat , but whether it was a shout or a sob or a peal of laughter , neither occupant of the room was to know . Before she could utter it Iona slumped over in a faint . ' Lady Twixtwain 's miracle tonic had as its source a spring in the heart of the Weirdwood  --  the same spring that provided a measure of flood control for the network of subterranean canals that wound their way to Ylfcwen 's palace .

You may still ring for anything you require , " he said through the door , when she was locked into her royal bedchamber . She tested the bell cord to see if it would indeed be answered . Minutes passed , then an hour . The director had perhaps meant to be sarcastic . Hours passed in the dark ; she did not light any lamps . When the fireflies died she doubted they would replace them .
