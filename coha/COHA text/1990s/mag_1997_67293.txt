VARSITY TEAMS : 20 INTRAMURAL SPORTS : 19 FAMOUS ALUMNI : TRACY CAULKINS , EMMITT SMITH , STEVE SPURRIER EXTRA CREDIT FOR : INVENTION OF GATORADE BY A FLORIDA PROF // The student section at Florida 's Ben Hill Griffin Stadium , better known as the Swamp , long ago adopted as its motto " We 're the worst . " Cmedian Jeff Foxworthy recently recalled his 1990 stand-up act at a sold-out Swamp as a terrifying moment . " One of the students who put on the show said before I went , ' Oh , yeah , we 've had everybody , ' " said Foxworthy of his performance at the Gator Growl , the homecoming week Fla-lapalooza billed as the world 's largest student-run pep rally . " ' We had Bob Hope . We booed him off the stage . We booed the Smothers Brothers off the stage . We made Paula Poundstone cry . ' " ( Foxworthy was lucky ; he was cheered. ) // Put an opposing football team on the field and the Swamp becomes what the Atlanta Journal-Constitution once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of real estate in all of college football . " You might expect such fervor at a school that , besides being the national champion in football , is one of two universities  --  UCLA is the other  --  that has placed in the Top 10 in the NCAA all-sports rankings each year since 1984 . Of the 20 varsity sports the Gators play , only the men 's basketball team had a losing record in 1995-96 , and at week 's end 17 of the teams were above .500 this year . Florida is also the best women 's sports school in the country ( page 84 ) . // Even the intramural teams compete for national championships . In late December , two afternoons before the tackle-football Gators claimed the national title with a 35-29 Sugar Bowl thrashing of Florida State , two teams from Florida finished second and third in the flag-football nationals in New Orleans . " Our fraternity is based on Hag football , " says John Dawson , president of the Florida chapter of Pi Lambda Phi , the third-place finisher in New Orleans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was 48 years ago that Pi Lambda Phi and Tau Epsilon Phi , Florida 's two largest Jewish fraternities , first staged the annual Nose Bowl , so named by the participants for the generous proboscises found on some team members . Today , pledges from the two houses practice for the game DA hours a day , six days a week . As many as 900 alumni from the frats flock to the event , which is shown on cable TV as far away as South Florida . // The rest of the campus takes only a slightly more restrained approach to sports . Roughly 85% of Florida 's 29,637 undergraduates participate in intramurals . To keep up with the demand the school built a second . $6.6 million student rec center in 1995 to go with the $3.6 million center it unveiled less than three years earlier . Students who like the outdoors go to Lake Wauburg , a short drive from campus , to water-ski , canoe and sail . // But Florida would not be Florida without its crazed fans . To wit : Bradford Yates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not missed a Lady Gators home basketball game . Yates , who did n't even attend Florida , wraps tape around his hands before games so his incessant clapping wo n't cause them to bleed . " He 's a sold-out arena all by himself , " says coach Carol Ross . // On the morning of Nov. 15 , 1995 , Yates 's house near campus caught fire . As the inferno raged , he could n't help thinking of the women 's hoops game that evening . " I had n't missed one since 1992 , " he says . Happily , the fire was doused in time for Yates to make tip-off . What would he have done had the conflagration occurred closser to game time ? " Boy , " says Yates , sounding genuinely stumped , " Hmmm . Jeez . That 's a tough one . "
