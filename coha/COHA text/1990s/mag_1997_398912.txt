Dear Dr. Cory : How do hiccups form ? Alyse Smith Los Alamitos , California Dear Dr. Cory : When my mom eats jalapeno peppers , she hiccups . What causes her to do that ? Christie Walker Landover Hills , Maryland Dear Alyse and Christie : Under your lungs is a large , flat muscle called the diaphragm ( DIE-a-fram ) . This powerful muscle almost divides your body in half . The diaphragm moves as you breathe . Sometimes the diaphragm will contract with a series of quick jolts . This sudden tightening causes you to breathe in a rapid gulp of air . At the same time , your vocal cords close . The air rushing over the vocal cords makes them vibrate , causing the hiccup sound . The phrenic ( FREN-ik ) nerve that runs from the back of the neck to the chest controls the diaphragm . Anything that irritates the phrenic nerve can cause the diaphragm to contract and give you the hiccups . The more common causes are eating or drinking too fast or too much , or being excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own after a short amount of time . More stubborn cases can be helped by trying to break the cycle by taking a big drink of water.You can also try holding your breath or breathing into a paper bag for a few minutes . This increases the amount of carbon dioxide in your lungs and may slow or stop the muscle contractions . Another method that sometimes works is to sweep a cotton swab gently back and forth over the back part of the roof of your mouth for a minute or so . Dear Dr. Cory : // Why do sinuses hurt so much and what causes sinus infections ? My sinuses are hurting . Aubrey Strauss Cincinnati , Ohio Dear Aubrey : Sinuses are large air spaces found in the bones around your nose and eyes . We have eight in all-four on each side.They are connected to the nose by small openings and drain through the nose . The sinuses are lined with mucous membranes that contain tiny hairs called cilia . The membrane makes a cleansing fluid called mucus . The mucus and the cilia help to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might inhale . The mucus also helps to moisten the air that we breathe . The main purpose of the sinuses is to lighten the weight of the bones in your skull . Sinuses also act as vibrating chambers when you speak . If you place your hands on your face while you make vowel sounds , you can feel your sinuses vibrate . During a sinus infection , the membranes of your nose swell up and close off the opening to your sinuses , preventing the drainage of pus or mucus . When sinuses are unable to drain normally , they often become painful and tender to the touch from inflammation and pressure that build up . Sinus infections can be caused by bacteria , viruses , or fungi . Oftentimes a person has a cold before a sinus infection develops . Allergies can also lead to sinus infections . Antibiotic medication can be prescribed for sinus infections caused by bacteria . Dear Dr. Cory : What causes asthma ?
