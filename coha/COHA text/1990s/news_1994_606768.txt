<p> The thing about food is : You do n't have to know a lot about it to know a lot about it . Unlike , for example , opera , or the Dead Sea Scrolls . Which is probably how I got my first food job , at Bon Appe'tit magazine , where I mainly edited travel articles . I 'd never worked with food people before , and so I went into shock when , on my first day , a couple of my new colleagues took me out to a trendy restaurant called City , where they proceeded to get into a lengthy discussion with one of the owners about where the starter for the sourdough bread had come from . Evidently it had come from a little-known bakery in San Francisco . Like I could care . <p> This was L.A. , at the beginning of the Bush administration , and my colleagues sat in what they described as " raw space "  --  a soaring undecorated indoor box with exposed air-conditioning ducts  --  taking tiny little itsy-bitsy mincing bites of this totally great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the raspberry-Dijon to produce an effect not unlike that of certain Napa Valley cabernet sauvignons . And I was like : Huh ? I 'm from Washington , where we talk about real estate and Presidential mishaps and we eat meat . Quickly . <p> Actually I , too , sat there , ravenously hungry  --  on my own unbelievably uncomfortable , spasm-inducing metallic industrialesque chair  --  taking teeny-weeny itsy-bitsy bites and , every now and again , nodding sagely . Because I 'd never been around food people before , and I was intimidated out of my head . <p> The point is  --  well , there is no point . But I often think of that lunch , as I go about my daily doings . Because for a brief and shining moment , before I became pregnant with my first child and started feeling sick at the first whiff of roasted chicken with herbs on a bed of garlic greens from the magazine 's test kitchens , I was a **29;325;TOOLONG . I too could talk about sourdough starters and throw words like " insouciance , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then all that came to a halt . The pregnancy turned into a baby , and we moved from Southern California to Northwest Washington , and we were suddenly surrounded by people whose sole topic of conversation was how hard it is to make partner . <p> And then I had twins , and all that gourmet food stuff ( speaking of which , " gourmet " was a forbidden word at Bon Appe'tit ) became a faraway and misty memory , like the corner store , or pop music before Madonna . <p> And now my gastronomic endeavors revolve around two main ingredients . Tuna and peanut butter . And I think about my ex-colleagues from Bon Appe'tit and how absolutely horrified they 'd be if they could see my life . <p> Because what they almost never show in the magazines is pictures of people out there actually buying the food . Oh yeah , I know . What about those charming photos of pretty young chefs choosing fresh strawberries and placing them in a wicker basket at the open-air farmers ' market ? Get real , girlfriend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But since when can you buy Pampers and tuna fish at the farmers ' market ? The point is , if you do n't buy the food , you ca n't cook the food . I have a confession . I 've never really gotten over being intimidated by food fanatics . Like at Sutton Place Gourmet ( there 's that word again ) ? Yeah , it 's a great store and all , but I ca n't pronounce the names of half the cheeses . And they 're always playing Mozart 's Piano Concerto No. 9 in E-Flat Major . And everyone who works there looks like a fashion model . <p> Which is just one of the reasons I 'm a supermarket gal . The other reason is that there 's a big supermarket about two seconds from my house . Because I spend tons and tons of time schlepping groceries . Like when I meet people , at the one or perhaps two social engagements I attend yearly , and they say , " What do you do ? " ( This is always the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) And I say : " Well , I 've got three kids , so I guess you could say that I change diapers and go grocery shopping . " Usually , by the time I 've finished this sentence , their eyes have glazed over , and they turn away , in search of someone more Northwest Washingtony  --  a speech writer or journalist or Presidential candidate  --  to talk to . God knows . But I 'm thinking : food . It runs our lives . And then I go over in search of the tahini dip . <p> Grocery shopping has in fact assumed such an important role in my life that it has become one of the chief topics of conversation in my house . Recently my husband said : <p> " We 're out of ketchup again . Did you put it on the list ? " <p> And I said : " Why do n't you put it on the list ? " <p> And he said : " We should never run out of ketchup . Have n't you ever heard of staples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Permanent List "  --  my husband 's idea . The problem was that we were constantly running out of , well , everything . So he came up with this solution : You create a " permanent list , " with things that we should always have in stock , like oatmeal , milk and grapefruit ( my husband loves grapefruit ) , and every time I go to the grocery store , I 'll check the Permanent List , to see which items we 've run out of , in order to replace them . Smart , n'est-ce pas ? <p> I go to a supermarket that 's widely considered to be the worst grocery store in America . The produce ? Bleah . The bakery-baked breads ? Wet cardboard . The fish ? Can you say " food poisoning " ? But it was there at the supermarket that I got in touch with my Inner Cook . <p> At first I was n't aware of my Inner Cook . But bit by bit , she started talking to me , saying things like : " A day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And : " A little ice cream never hurt anyone . " And : " Mac and Cheese , it 's quick , it 's easy and it 's not really so bad for you . " It took me a while , but bit by bit I realized that my Inner Cook sounded very much like my mother , whom I had become . <p> This was an uncomfortable feeling , but it was probably inevitable . Because here I was , pushing one , and then  --  due to producing two at once  --  three kids around the store , frantically trying to shush them with off-key renditions of Top Forty hits like " It 's a Small World After All " while really mean , really fast , really strong little old ladies bashed their carts into mine and gave me killer-eyes . <p> And the irony is : My mother did n't shop at my supermarket . She shopped at a whole different chain . That was in the 1960s , in McLean , where I grew up . In those days , I spent a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Parker House rolls that my mother made , quite wonderfully , right in the store ! Right in the Frozen Foods aisle ! And there she was , my wonderful mother , pushing a cart filled with kids and groceries and feeding us lunch , right there , in front of everyone , and no one could stop her ! It was my best friend Nina 's mother who shopped at the chain I go to , and she was no fun . <p> The thing is , once you turn into your mother , foodwise , you 're genetically programmed to sing songs like " It 's a Small World After All " while shoving green bananas and packages of ground chuck into your basket . And bottles of Ragu spaghetti sauce . And Tuna Helper and Campbell 's Chicken Noodle Soup and a million other items that the folks at Bon Appe'tit have never even heard of . <p> What I remember about sitting in my mother 's basket , as she wheeled it around the seemingly cavernous supermarket in McLean was : She knew everyone . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the checkout people . It was our version of going to the country club . And hey ! The same thing 's happened to me . I go to my supermarket and see all my pals . I find out who 's pregnant and whose kid just got into Sidwell Friends , who 's carrying on an affair and who just bought a new Chevrolet Mini-Van . <p> In the 15-to-20-minute lines at the checkout counters , I get to flip through food magazines and dream of fresh pasta 10,000 ways . <p> And the checkout people , each of whom will go straight to that big supermarket in the sky when he or she is called by his or her Maker  --  what I 'm trying to say is that they 're all really nice , and it ca n't be an easy job  --  see me and my brood coming and say , for example : <p> " How 's it going ? " <p> And my oldest son , now 5 , will say , for example : " Men pee standing up and girls pee sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got home from camp I threw up all over Mommy 's shoes . " <p> And then my Inner Cook will say : " Boys will be boys and , by the way , hamburgers and mashed potatoes is delish and nutrish . " <p> And then the little old lady standing behind me in the checkout line , her own basket filled with Stouffer 's Baked Chicken and Mixed Vegetables , and Metamucil , will bang the front of her cart into the back of mine , muttering something about how in her day children knew how to behave and parents knew how to discipline . <p> And the checkout guy will roll his eyes in sympathy . <p> And my kid will reach for a Hershey bar . <p> And when I get home , my husband will say : <p> " Where 's the ketchup ? Did you consult the Permanent List ? " <p> Let me ask you : Can you have this much fun at a gourmet store ? I think not . It 's my theory that only at a supermarket can a gal shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes and grocery-shops in upper Northwest Washington .
