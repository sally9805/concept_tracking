Section : SUPPLEMENTS/REPORT AND TEST <p> Sinatra and Bennett were two of the headliners at Bally 's Resort in Las Vegas last April . No , not Frank and Tony . Dr. Stephen Sinatra , editor of the newsletter HeartSense , and Michael Bennett , a pharmacist and author of " Wild Yam : Nature 's Source of Phytohormones . " Welcome to the Health Show , one of the nation 's largest consumer conferences featuring nutritional supplements , products that are not always what they seem . <p> By any measure , the intake of over-the-counter supplements has reached critical mass . In 1997 , Americans spent an estimated $12 billion for vitamins and minerals ; herbals , also called botanicals ( saw palmetto and St. John 's wort , for example ) ; sports supplements ( creatine , androstenedione ) ; or specialty supplements ( shark cartilage , glucosamine ) . Sales are up nearly 30 percent from 1995 , says the Nutrition Business Journal , an industry newsletter . Also growing : the number of doctors and pharmacists adding prestige to these products . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there 's little evidence that most people who take them are putting themselves in peril . But with prices that rise to more than 30 cents a pill , consumers can spend lots of money on products with little or no proven efficacy . <p> Moreover , because Congress has virtually stripped nutritional supplements of regulation , users are playing roulette with their own bodies - and there 's a chance they 'll make a big mistake . From January 1993 to October 1998 , the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) received 2,621 reports of serious problems - including 101 deaths - linked to supplements . Such reports recently led the editors of The New England Journal of Medicine to throw down the gauntlet before the industry . " It is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride , " they said , and they called for more-rigorous testing . <p> This report will help you separate hype from fact . It summarizes current evidence about the effectiveness of more than a dozen popular supplements , explains how regulations allow supplements to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deaths , and explores how marketers get their message across . We also analyzed various brands of two current favorites , echinacea and ginkgo biloba , to see what was really in them . Who 's in charge ? <p> Today 's supplements do n't get as much government scrutiny as medicated cough drops , whose labels must at least carry general cautions and dosage information . This laissez-faire policy was n't always the case . For years , companies had to be ready to show the FDA that their products were safe , and if the agency suspected that a supplement about to go on the market was unsafe , it could seize it . In 1993 , the FDA got even tougher , proposing regulations that would make manufacturers prove any claim that their products treated disease or helped any health-related condition . <p> The industry struck back by fanning consumers ' fears that the FDA might restrict or ban many supplements . It backed a grassroots letter-writing campaign that spurred congressional passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 ( DSHEA ) , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labeled " supplement " so long as the product made no claim to affect a disease . ( Drugs , which do claim to affect a disease , must undergo clinical studies to determine their safety and effectiveness . The FDA must review the data and authorize a drug 's uses before it 's sold . ) <p> To avoid druglike claims , many supplement makers lace labels with locutions a lawyer could love , replacing " alleviates constipation , " say , with " promotes regularity . " Supplement advertising , controlled by the Federal Trade Commission , is subject to slightly different rules ( see " The Selling of Supplements , " below ) . <p> Today , a supplement is presumed safe until the FDA receives numerous reports of adverse reactions . At that point , the agency can warn the public , suggest changes in the supplement to make it safer , urge the manufacturer to recall the product , or recall or seize the product itself . To seize a supplement , however , the FDA must prove - in court , if necessary - that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banning any supplements since the 1994 law went into effect . As a result , you 'll still see ephedra - an herb linked to 38 deaths - in stores , despite public warnings by the FDA . ( The agency 's most recent warning , in January , involved a chemical sold under several names , including GBL and Blue Nitro . It 's called a supplement but is actually related to a drug banned in the U.S. since 1991 , and it has been linked to one death and 54 cases of severe reactions , including seizures . ) <p> Even if its supposed active ingredient is safe and effective ( a big if ) , there 's no guarantee that a supplement contains the amount thought to work , or the amount the label claims : <p> Larry Sasich , pharmacist and analyst at the Public Citizen Health Research Group , a nonprofit consumer-rights group founded by Ralph Nader . <p> Author Andrew Weil , who sees conventional medicine as best for fast-moving diseases , herbals as widely useful for noncritical care . When we tested ten brands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the total concentration of ginsenosides , the supposed active ingredients . Last March , the Good Housekeeping Institute tested nine brands of St. John 's wort and found a 17-fold difference in the amount of a suspected active ingredient . When the Los Angeles Times tested St. John 's wort last September , it found that seven of ten brands came up short . Our recent tests of ginkgo biloba and echinacea products showed variations in active ingredients or in compounds that indicate the presence of the active ingredient ( see " What 's in This Stuff ? " below ) . The psychology of self-help <p> When did mainstream American move from " an apple a day " to ginseng and feverfew ? The real push began in 1992 with the creation of the National Institutes of Health 's Office of Alternative Medicine ( now the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ) . Congress set up the office to evaluate " unconventional health care practices . " As the NIH began its work , news media began to pay more attention , the public 's interest grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitched by a real doctor made famous by TV ( Art Ulene ) , an actor who plays a doctor on TV ( Hector Elizondo ) , and the host of the game show " Jeopardy ! " ( Who is Alex Trebek ? ) , and they 're reportedly taken by no less an icon than Mark McGwire , said to favor the supposed muscle-builder andro-stenedione . But with huge gaps in our knowledge , Americans ' willingness to buy the pitches can be scary . <p> Many in the audience at the Las Vegas Health Show seemed more interested in hearing self-care gurus than in cold science . Lillian Arzivian of Henderson , Nev. , listened to a lecture on " Supplements for the 21st Century " by pharmacist Earl Mindell , then bolted for his booth to thumb through books and look at products . " Glucosamine sulfate and shark cartilage have been touted for a while , " the 70-something Arzivian said . " That 's what most of us are taking , but now this Zinaxin is something new on the market . And supposedly it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is to check it out . " <p> Andrew Weil , the Harvard Medical School graduate turned alternative-medicine advocate , calls the phenomenon part of a trend that includes increased demand for natural and organic foods . " I think that there is a deep suspicion that pharmaceutical medicine is dangerous , " he says , " and people have a very great longing for treatments that are more natural and gentler . " Dr. Weil says that in the past year , he 's seen widespread interest in opening up medical institutions to alternative medicine . Doctors jump on board <p> Increasing numbers of Americans seem inclined to see their doctor as a self-care helper rather than a voice of authority . As Weil notes , many doctors have responded to that message - and to the evidence that some supplements may be of use - by offering " complementary " medicine , a mix of the conventional and the New Age . <p> Dr. Robert Tenery Jr. , chairman of the American Medical Association 's council on ethical and judicial affairs , sees nothing wrong with doctors ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for personal profit by , for example , hooking up with Rexall Showcase International ( not affiliated with the former Rexall drugstore chain ) . <p> Rexall offers dozens of supplements at wholesale prices to distributors who sell them at retail prices typically marked up 25 percent to 40 percent ( Rexall 's products include the Sundown brand , whose echinacea and ginkgo we tested ) . And these supplements are n't always cheap : A month 's worth of Rexall 's Optimal Health Pack , consisting of herbs , vitamins , minerals , and fiber , costs $145 at retail . In addition to selling supplements , Rexall participants recruit new salespeople and typically collect a 10 percent commission on their recruits ' sales . <p> In a promotional tape aimed at doctors , an internal medicine specialist from South Salem , N.Y. , says that he has put hundreds of patients on Rexall Showcase products since 1995 , when he became involved with the company . " Managed care has taken a tremendous toll on our practice , " he says . " The loyalty is gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In fact , says Rexall President David Schofield , up to one-third of the company 's 100,000 distributors are health-care professionals . <p> At its annual meeting this June , the AMA plans to consider the ethics of profiting from such marketing systems . Pharmacists jump , too <p> Drug stores , citing consumer demand ( and competition from supermarkets , health-food stores , mail-order firms , the Internet , doctors , door-to-door salespeople , even gas stations ) , are pushing supplements with increasing vigor . And they 're putting them at the pharmacist 's counter - right by the cash register . Beth Kaplan , senior executive vice president for Rite Aid , says , " We view the whole category of nutritional supplements as a strategic extension of our pharmacy business . " <p> Drug stores may willingly ring up your purchase of shark cartilage , but how much do pharmacists know ? A survey of 1,000 randomly selected pharmacists conducted by the American Pharmaceutical Association ( APhA ) found that only about one-third felt comfortable counseling patients about herbal remedies . <p> " For any health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit is unconscionable , " says Larry Sasich , a pharmacist and an analyst at the Public Citizen Health Research Group . " This stuff has become the snake oil of the 1990s . " The APhA has issued no such condemnation . " Each pharmacist has to decide what to recommend based on his or her own view , " says an APhA spokeswoman . Setting standards <p> With pressure for regulation mounting , there is change afoot in the supplements industry - which even the head of the National Nutritional Foods Association , a nonprofit industry group , has called " independent , wild , and woolly . " Three groups have plans that might eventually result in basic standards for supplements : <p> The FDA . It was tossed one crumb by the 1994 law : the power to require that supplement makers follow " good manufacturing practices . " Those would specify , for example , standards for sanitation at the factory but would n't guarantee the purity or efficacy of the product . The FDA is considering such practices but has yet to implement them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police itself . Supplements produced by members of the National Nutritional Foods Association are tested at random , in what the association identifies as independent labs , to see if they match label claims . ( There 's no way for buyers to identify tested products . ) Later this year , the association plans to begin certifying members ' factories every three years for the same good manufacturing practices being considered by the FDA . For consistently failing inspections , though , members will merely be tossed from the association . <p> The U.S. Pharmacopeia ( USP ) . This private , nonprofit group , which sets standards for pharmaceuticals ( and vitamins and minerals ) in the U.S. , has begun producing monographs about herbs . ( USP uses advisors from various groups , including Consumers Union . ) The monographs sum up any evidence of effectiveness and detail standards for quality , strength , and purity of the final product . The most recent standards became official last November , too recently to tell whether manufacturers will adopt them . In any case , they 're voluntary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked except in response to complaints . <p> Some industry-watchers had feared that drug companies might try to avoid regulation by selling their products as supplements , but one appears to be taking a different tack . PharmaPrint of Irvine , Calif. , recently said it would ask the FDA to approve its herbal products as prescription drugs . <p> The firm uses a proprietary process to isolate and measure the purportedly active ingredients ( the process is already used in over-the-counter Centrum Herbals ) . Because its products can be protected by a patent , PharmaPrint is willing to spend millions of dollars on tests to prove to the FDA each herb 's safety and effectiveness . <p> PharmaPrint 's plans pose thorny questions : How much more might prescription supplements cost ? Would insurers pay ? And can a supplement be a prescription drug , too ? A collision of those two worlds would challenge basic tenets of the 1994 law , which would then have to be sorted out in federal court , industry sources say . Recommendations <p> Congress should re-examine the Dietary Supplement Health and Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the marketplace . Meanwhile , before you take a supplement , consider changes in diet or behavior that might accomplish your goals . Avoid treating possibly serious problems yourself , and do n't dismiss effective conventional treatments . A woman who is pregnant or nursing should consult her doctor before taking supplements . <p> If , despite the unknowns , you wish to try a supplement , learn about it and consult your doctor . If you notice side effects , stop taking it , tell your doctor , and notify the FDA 's MedWatch monitoring program ( 800 FDA-1088 ; www.fda.gov ) . Finally , view the word " natural " with skepticism ; after all , hemlock and arsenic are natural , too .

The good , the bad , and the questionable <p> Below , a roster of nutritional supplements that have made news , for good or ill . They 're listed in alphabetical order , along with their purported benefits , evidence of efficacy , and potential side effects . TABLE <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> WHAT 'S IN THIS STUFF ? <p> We chose two of the most popular herbal supplements , echinacea and ginkgo biloba , and had a lab analyze a dozen brands of each . For echinacea , we checked the levels of four phenolic compounds that serve as markers for the herb . For ginkgo , we looked to see whether the supposed active ingredients matched the usual claims . Although we checked against the commonly accepted potency , no one knows for sure what the " best " dosage is for either herb . We tested at least three bottles or packages per brand for each herb ; our figures are averages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 100 pills - or $10 for 50 . Check our lists before buying . Products are in alphabetical order , and cost per pill is the estimated average for the bottles we bought , based on a national survey . You may save if you buy the biggest size . Echinacea : Adieu to ah-choo ? <p> Americans spend more than $300 million a year for this wildflower , touted as a cold remedy . Are they getting what they pay for ? We tested 12 brands for the phenolic compounds caffeoyl-tartaric acid , chlorogenic acid , cichoric acid , and echinacoside . Most products cite the amount of echinacea per pill ( 50 to 500 milligrams ) , instead of phenolic compounds . But by a guideline some products use , those compounds should make up at least 4 percent of the echinacea claimed for each pill . <p> As the table below shows , the total percentage of the four compounds per pill varied from brand to brand . Of the two products that promised at least 4 percent total phenolic compounds ( and confirmed that those were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunsource Echinex , came close to 4 percent , on average . ( Two other products also met that level , though they did n't claim to . ) Even within a brand , pills in different bottles had different percentages . <p> The amount of those compounds per pill also varied , from an average of 2 milligrams , in Nature Made , to more than 10 milligrams , in Nature 's Herbs . Given the different dosages among products , someone taking the recommended dose of One-A-Day could consume about 2 milligrams of phenolic compounds per day , while someone taking Nature 's Herbs could consume more than 90 milligrams . TABLE Ginkgo : For " senior moments " ? <p> Ginkgo biloba has been used for thousands of years in China and is widely used in Europe . Ginkgo 's rise to herbal superstar status in the U.S. began in 1997 with a study published by the nonprofit New York Institute for Medical Research . Researchers said that ginkgo biloba extract helped stabilize and even partially improve - for six months to a year - the cognitive performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease or multiple ministrokes . Results were modest , however , and we have found no long-term studies of ginkgo 's effects on people with no signs of memory loss . <p> The active ingredients in ginkgo biloba are thought to be flavone glycosides and terpene lactones . Flavone glycosides make up 24 percent of the ginkgo biloba product used in the New York Institute study ; terpene lactones , 6 percent . The same percentages are claimed by many products sold in the U.S. <p> On average , the brands we tested came within 2 percentage points of meeting those amounts . As with echinacea , however , the percentage in individual bottles often varied . Concentrations of flavone glycosides in individual samples of Nature Made , for instance , ranged from about 24 percent to 35 percent ; in Nature 's Resource , terpene lactones ranged from 7 percent to about 13 percent . TABLE <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> THE SELLING OF SUPPLEMENTS Trust me , it works <p> The Food and Drug Administration controls supplement labels and accompanying flyers . Those ca n't claim that the product affects a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure or function " of the body , so long as the maker notifies the FDA within 30 days after the product goes on sale . Recently , the FDA proposed modifying its definition of " disease , " making it tougher for manufacturers to make unsubstantiated health claims . What 's more , beginning this March , the FDA is requiring a " Supplements Facts " panel on labels , including ingredients . The panel should make it easier to compare brands , but it still wo n't certify that what 's on the label is in the product . <p> Meanwhile , the Federal Trade Commission recently issued guidelines for advertising . The agency said that although supplement ads can make disease claims , they must be based on reliable scientific evidence . This gives " good players in the industry . . . the guidance they need , " says Jodie Bernstein , director of the FTC 's Bureau of Consumer Protection . " Others will continue to face vigorous enforcement by the FTC . " Yet in 1998 , the agency took legal action against just eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover personal testimonials , a mainstay of supplement marketing that could stand some control , judging by testimonials we saw . Before a crowd of about 100 at the Las Vegas Health Show , Michael Corrigan , a vice president of supplement maker Nature 's Way , relayed praise for the Company 's ginkgo - praise he 'd heard from the wife of the company 's president . " She took it for about four weeks , and she became a walking advertisement about the benefits of this product , " Corrigan said . <p> And a pamphlet touting Christopher 's Original Formulas ProTrac herbs for " emotional clarity " included kudos from a man who once worked in the company 's sales department . Asked whether that was n't deceptive , a company representative replied , " Well , he took the formula , so in a way he was a customer . " <p>
