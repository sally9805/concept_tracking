" I REMEMBER THE POLICE COMing and taking him away . That was a pretty spooky deal . " Bill Clinton was less than six when his drunken stepfather was arrested for firing a gun during a marital quarrel . But , he says , " I remember it like it was yesterday . " That was in the little town of Hope , where Clinton was born . " The neighbors knew about it . " Shortly afterward the family moved to Hot Springs , where , Clinton says , " we never had a public incident . " <P> But they did . As a 15-year-old , Clinton gave a sworn deposition against his stepfather : " I was present on March 27 , 1959 , and it was I who called my mother 's attorney , who in turn had to get the police to come to the house to arrest the defendant . The last occasion in which I went to my mother 's aid , when he was abusing my mother , he threatened to mash my face in if I took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he also forgot that he ever gave the deposition , now on file in the Garland Chancery Court . <P> When I reminded his mother about this , she said , " Bill and I have always been able to do that . I know you people are amazed at this , but we would always put away anything unpleasant . " In fact , his mother does not remember her own deposition given in the same divorce proceedings . The name of her lawyer is a stranger 's name now . She does n't even remember the timing or circumstances of her remarriage to Roger Clinton  --  a remarkable suppression of the past . In fact , when a cousin suggested she did not pursue the divorce to its conclusion , she could not deny that with certainty  --  and neither could her son . Only the court records restore the sequence . Her divorce did become final in May 1962  --  and three months later she remarried the man she had divorced . <P> Even during the short time when the family was separated , Bill , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's drunken behavior . The mother and son moved into a new house then , and Bill remembers having to get a neighbor , Jim Clark , to show him how to use a posthole digger for putting up the mailbox . But the girl next door , a minister 's daughter who became his close friend in school , never knew about the furies raging inside the Clinton home . No one knew  --  not Clinton 's high school counselor , not his pastor , not his closest friends . <P> Going back into his childhood is a form of emotional spelunking that Clinton has always avoided . He did not break his silence until Joe Klein of New York magazine , working from hints he had picked up from Clinton 's mother , asked the candidate direct questions about his stepfather 's drinking and violence . Clinton told more about his past as court records came to light and as his younger brother described their home to reporters . " One of the frustrating things about this whole deal , this nationwide attempt to make me look slick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people expect me to remember things I do n't remember all of , or to share things I thought I was never supposed to share . I mean , it 's a strange sort of deal . "
