<p> CARTER GAVE AWAY TOO MUCH TO THE JUNTA <p> Editor  --  That The Chronicle published a letter on Haiti like Rob Lowe 's ( September 20 ) , and on the very day of the agreement , was like a breath of fresh air . The people of Haiti were indeed dancing in the streets at the arrival of U.S. troops . And why should n't they ? The hated band of murderers who had usurped their government was about to go . All the obtuse speculation by conservative politicians , academicians and journalists , all the justification for doing nothing , was swept aside in a few hours when it was clear how the people of Haiti felt about getting rid of the generals . <p> The only down side to the people 's exhilaration was that Carter , well-meaning or not , gave away too much  --  i.e. , amnesty  --  allowing these thugs to stay in power until October 15 and allowing them to stay in Haiti and participate in politics afterwards . All of this secured a safe landing for U.S. troops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not supporting Aristide  --  may cause problems in the long run . <p> The problem with the agreement is a perfect example of how American politicians have approached the matter all along : overestimating the power of this band of murderous thugs and underestimating the will of the Haitian people , continually expressed as support for democracy and support for the Aristide government . <p> That most Americans were prepared to agree with George Bush that he " could n't find a single reason " to intervene in Haiti , while George had been quite willing to " kick butt " to save the Emir of Kuwait 's oil , I find bizarre and disturbing . I think racism has to have something to do with it . And more generally , I think it is the cynical abandonment of real " values , " like love for freedom and democracy , beneath the more and more unabashedly represented politics of greed and self-interest , that threatens to smother what occasional sparks of idealism there are in our national psyche . <p> STEVE HAMILTON <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 lead story on Haiti quotes a Haitian policeman , upon being asked why he beats peaceful civilians , saying , " It 's my job .

" <p> KAREN McNEIL <p> Oakland <p> . <p> GOP STRATEGIES <p> Editor  --  Looks like the Republicans will be running on two parallel strategies in the very important November elections . First , to make the voting a national referendum on Clinton 's " wrong-track " policies and a scandal-ridden Congress in need of a top-to-bottom housecleaning . Second , a populist agenda for change : less government , lower taxes , more accountability . <p> The theme : " Had enough ?

Saunders for her September 9 column titled , " Social Engineering : The Semester . " I have been a high-school English teacher for more than ten years , and I just voted to do away with a similar " Social Engineering " program in my high school . <p> I try to teach my students to read thoughtfully , measuring what they read against their own experiences , and I try to teach them to write well enough so they can clearly express the range of their experiences , including the thoughts and feelings generated by those experiences . In the advanced classes , I teach analytical thinking and writing , in preparation for those tasks at the collegiate level . My concern , however , is that the public intends for the schools to do much , much more than teach skills . With the changing social milieu of two working parents , single parents , latchkey kids , the lessening of home supervision , day care , and the confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to raise their children for them  --  a task far beyond the scope of hour-long classes , sometimes with more than 30 students to a class . At best , I am a teacher , a good one , but I can be only a poor , part-time , substitute father at school . <p> RICHARD W. SCHAUT <p> Middletown ( Lake County ) <p> . <p> HI CLASS IS GOOD <p> Editor  --  This is in response to Debra J. Saunders ' column on September 9 . <p> Children should n't be allowed to think about their feelings in school . They should n't be taught how to deal with problems in their teenage years . Sex education should be taught by science teachers who put a lot of emphasis on the vas deferens and very little on protecting yourself from life-threatening diseases . Children who are abused or neglected at home should not bring their problems to school with them . School is a place only to learn facts , not to discover who you are . <p> These are some people 's thoughts on how schools should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be encouraged to share their thoughts , feelings and concerns with each other . <p> They should feel comfortable around their teachers and classmates . They should learn how to protect themselves against pregnancy , AIDS , and STD 'S . They should feel free to share and ask the class for advice on how to deal with problems in the home . They should learn how to make responsible choices that affect themselves and others . <p> These are all things that are discussed , taught and dealt with in the Human Interact class at Petaluma High School . The issues covered in the class are important to teenagers . A lesson on using condoms to prevent AIDS seems to be more useful and important than geometry . No matter how much you pretend that teenage sex leading to AIDS is n't a problem , you ca n't ignore the proven fact that people  --  KIDS  --  are dying . <p> There is nothing harmful or shocking going on in the HI class . It was made to benefit the student and it is . I should know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petaluma <p> . <p> NICKEL-AND-DIME METERS <p> Editor  --  Last Monday , five members of the Board of Supervisors attempted to solve a problem that has frustrated and angered a majority of our citizens and visitors : The quarter-only parking meters . You would have thought that this was a simple issue , since so many citizens wanted us to " just do it . " <p> Unfortunately , a majority of the board failed to support legislation that would have restored nickel and dime slots . Several of my colleagues expressed concern over the cost of replacing the existing meters . The cost of the meters would have been covered by revenue generated by the installation of 1,600 new meters , not from scarce general-fund resources . The deadline to convert the meters was also extended from December 1995 to June 1996 . <p> I supported this legislation because an overwhelming number of people in San Francisco want the meters changed back , and I believe that they are right . It has been said that we need to educate our small businesses on how to provide change to non-customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank , or every employee a teller . Not everyone should be expected to carry a roll of quarters in his or her pockets . We have an obligation to make something as simple as parking a car hassle free for our residents and visitors . <p> Parking has become a nightmare in San Francisco . We had the opportunity to make the situation a little easier . Instead , the meters will remain the same and citizen frustration continues to grow . <p> Speaking for myself , you have not seen the end of this issue . I promise to continue to fight for the correct change . <p> ANGELA ALIOTO , president <p> Board of Supervisors <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> KIDS NEED KIDS <p> Editor  --  As a teenager with siblings , I am responding to the article , " Teenage Moms With Only One Kid Fare Better " ( Chronicle , September 14 ) . In some aspects I can understand the outcome of the study , but I also think that " only children " take even more of a parent 's time than children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of siblings . <p> Siblings provide friendships , allowing children to receive attention from sources other than the parent , leaving a mother time to contiue her education or career . <p> MONIQUE WEBSTER <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> SPOILED BRATS <p> Editor  --  Re the baseball strike : Why wo n't those players shape up ? <p> I feel sad that there 's no baseball . I think that the players are paid too much money . They act like spoiled brats . It 's not fair that you guys get all that money just for playing baseball .
