<p> From afar , the four-story building looks like an image from a comic book : At roof level , a creepy gargoyle perches atop a gambrel peering down on the sidewalk . At night , he 's bathed in light , and the silhouette of a comic-book hero is illuminated in each front window of the facade . Atop each of these windows , a small gargoyle supports a stand holding comic books . <p> The imagery makes perfect sense : This is the home of the Words &; Pictures Museum , a place throbbing with the life and times of comic books in their myriad forms . The institution is the only major one of its kind focusing on the art of comic books , although San Francisco 's Cartoon Art Museum exhibits material focusing on newspaper comic strips - " funnies . " <p> The Words &; Pictures Museum has recently opened a striking exhibition of some 105 original works - all nicely framed - from their massive permanent collection of 12,000 original pictures . With its range of styles and material from the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and often engrossing window on an art form that has a highly visible impact on TV , films , advertising , and other current expressions of pop culture . <p> Popularity increase <p> " The interest in comic books - in the telling of stories using words and pictures - is really growing in terms of sales and the attention we 're getting , " says curator Fiona Russell , who selected the pictures and mounted the show , as we walked through the curious and compelling place . <p> The museum was created in Northampton in 1992 , and its present building opened on New Year 's Eve , 1994 . The city is a logical location since it is one of the centers of comic-book creation - " a hotbed of artists from a variety of genres , " as Ms. Russell puts it . <p> Here , for instance , is Mirage Publishing , the source of today 's biggest comic book - " Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , " which started in this form long before jumping into TV and films and onto T-shirts . <p> Pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover or the inside of comic books over the decades have been hung in the main gallery on the fourth floor , an eye-catching open space with Moroccan red walls and an arched white ceiling . <p> The art lining the walls at first seems indistinguishable from what you 'd see at a standard art show . Many pieces are imposing and fairly burst with unfamiliar detail , giving them a look quite different from the popular notion of sketchy comic-book art . <p> One reason is that the works displayed are larger than they appear in their final printed form . " Everything here was produced expressly for reproduction , " says Russell . " That 's the key to thinking about the artwork . But you can get more detail in your work if you draw large and shrink down . " <p> For instance , a set of panels from the 1991 comic book " Judgment on Gotham , " by the British artist Simon Bisley , clearly delineates the rippling muscles of a rather ghoulish Batman - one of some eight comic-book versions of Batman that Russell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pictures apparently are n't saying anything - despite their garrulous nature in comic books - because the word balloons you expect to see floating above their heads are missing . <p> Production steps <p> In making a comic book , " The word balloons are mostly done as an overlay , a clear piece of acetate with words on it , " Russell explains . " But if you include the acetate , after a while it tends to adhere to the artwork . So even though the majority of the pieces here are interior pages with balloons , we do n't display them that way . " <p> The acetate step , she explains , is part of a multistage process of making a comic book . Today it often does not result in the floppy 32-page form " so familiar to people over a certain age , " she says . " Sometimes they 're thicker and have a stiffer back . " <p> The exhibition offers many samples of these stages . In one 1968 comic-book cover , Captain America is seen swooping down on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of the late Jack Kirby , comic-book history 's most prolific artist , who worked from the 1950s through the 1980s . <p> " First the artist would create a pencil sketch , " Russell says . " Then a second person would come in and ink that . A third would color it and possibly letter it . " <p> There is no marked theme or chronology to the show , Russell states , and the resulting eclecticism is evident in the range of styles on the walls . Captain America 's adventures contrast with a comic-book cover by Tom Kidd that shows a fancy , Jules Verne-ish dirigible passing by a gingerbreadlike castle . Another frame in the show displays an inside page from the same comic : an ancient , classic interior with an indoor fountain and statuary along the walls . Through the windows a high-rise modern cityscape is visible . <p> Docents - often young people with an interest in art - are on hand to guide visitors . To get to the main exhibition , Russell likes you to walk through the museum 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words and pictures as a way of telling stories from its ancient roots . <p> You learn that the form transcends comics themselves as you go from the video-storelike entrance foyer into a make-believe cave . " We take the art of telling stories in this form as far back as we could , " Russell says , as she passes through narrow rock-walled corridors . <p> Prehistoric handprints and animal images on the walls give way to Australian aboriginal art . Gracefully the rough walls become man-made stone blocks as you pass a Greek archway into " the age of museums , " in Russell 's words . In an ancient German manuscript , a man speaks with God in word balloons in what amounts to a 12th-century comic . " Word balloons were actually prevalent at that time , " Russell explains . <p> The final part of the maze - " The Birth of American Comics " - includes about 500 covers , some in miniature , displayed across the wall under headings that almost tell the story of comics by themselves : mystery , suspense , horror/supernatural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superheroes , funnies , teen , romance . One picture is from the " Yellow Kid , " considered the first comic book , which appeared inside an 1896 newspaper . <p> " The audience for comics has grown up , " says Russell . " It once was something you tended to drop after adolescence , but the major readership level for comics is now college-age students and people in their 20s . As you grow up , consequently , you demand more sophisticated subject matter and techniques , so you have here art appealing to an adult . " She says museum visitors are about half children and half adults , with lots of families . <p> Like all media , comic books have their darker side in the form of " adult " issues . Although these sometimes-graphic depictions of sex and violence account for a small percentage of comic-book sales , they are a growing genre . Partly an outgrowth of the " underground comics " of the 1960s , their content ranges from biting social commentary - like looks at the origins of violence between Palestinians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been available under the table since comics began . <p> In Japan , where comics are big business , some men commuting to work can be seen reading thick comic books , many of them graphically demeaning in their depiction of women . <p> Graphic adult comic books are burgeoning in the United States and Canada . The content tends to include black-and-white drawings supporting the story line , both of which are offensive to many fans . <p> Shows just for adults , kids <p> Meanwhile , on the museum 's third floor , a much smaller , subsidiary show is offered that changes more frequently . At some of these shows , kids are allowed only when accompanied by adults ; at others , no adults unaccompanied by kids . <p> The just-closed exhibition - " Stiletto Heroes " - featured campy works , some of them semi-erotic , by the California artist known as Olivia . It will be replaced June 20 by an exhibition for families called " Read Minds " that features the character Cerebus , created by Dave Sim . <p> Kids tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Interactive Zone , " a kind of outdoor movie lot , where they can practice tracing , touch-screen comic-book drawing , and other hands-on activities .
