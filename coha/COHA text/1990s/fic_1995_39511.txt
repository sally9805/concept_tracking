THE SPRING THE OLD MAN FINISHED his boat was the worst one Orvil ever knew . The last of March it started raining , and hardly stopped the next five weeks . Roads turned to mud and creeks filled up all over southern Illinois , but Sweetfern got it worse than most . A gully-washer took the bridge , which left them stranded three whole days , and another flooded out the bottom so he 'd had to plant the soybeans twice . <p> In Carbondale they were talking  --  Orvil heard them on TV  --  saying it had to do with ozone . Greenhouse effect is what they called it , which did n't make much sense to Orvil . Greenhouses , he knew , were hot , but this spring rain was cold and mean . All the way into May , he 'd come in from the fields drenched , shivering like it was winter . Orvil had a lot of flesh , but this sharp rain bit to the bone . <p> " It 's coming , " said Luanne , his wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired and cold , and his boots were caked with thick , red mud . She stood by the kitchen door , watching where he put his feet . Her hair was up in plastic rollers , and she was smoking like always . " I told you so , and I was right . " <p> She sounded pleased and angry both . Orvil shrugged . He did n't talk much . Luanne talked enough for two and always thought she had the answers . Her eyes , he saw , were bad tonight . When she was worried they got worse , turning out instead of straight . Bending , he tugged at his boots . <p> " Better rain than drought , I guess . " <p> " Do n't you play dumb with me , " she said . " You know I mean more than this rain . I mean the boat , I heard it 's done . Shirlee called to say it 's leaving , next week the Old Man told her . He did n't say what ' leaving ' meant , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Shirlee , she do n't even know him . " <p> Orvil kept his eyes fixed on his boots , though he could only see the tips . For a short man Orvil weighed a lot , and most of it was in his gut . <p> " That do n't mean it 's the ark . " <p> " I 'm not saying it does or does n't , but Shirlee , she went to . look , she 's never seen a boat so big . Dry as bone up on that hill , why , it fills the barn the Old Man built , so something 's going on all right . You only got to see the news , those earthquakes out in California and all them black girls having babies , most of them are n't even married , and drugs and AIDS and killing , Orvil . You tell me why we 're being left out ? " <p> " Maybe he do n't know you care . " <p> " He 's not stupid , " said Luanne , " and I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that , it 's something else , and what I figured is he 's mad . So yesterday when I saw him stop to get his mail , I went out to talk to him . He looked surprised to see me , said he thought I worked afternoons , but I said no , my shift had changed . He said he was glad to know that . I thought that was kind of sweet , and he could n't have been more polite , formal , you know , like he is , but anyhow we had a talk so I know it is n't me he 's mad at . " <p> Her voice made Orvil think of rain , the way it sounded on the roof , nails driving into tin . <p> " Do n't see why he 's mad at all . " <p> " Well , if that 's not it , you tell me what . " <p> Orvil sighed . He knew she was n't really asking , and the fact was he was feeling tired . Luanne had that effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that he would consider telling her . She 'd never taken to criticism , especially since she 'd been saved . <p> One boot came off , then the other . He stayed resting , his head bent . Luanne crossed to the sink . When she walked her rollers clicked . Her cigarette hissed when it went out . She opened a can of pop . <p> " The thing is , Orvil , it ai n't fair , why , here we are his closest neighbors and I. know folks are going to ... " <p> He stopped listening . It was easy , something he did all the time . Orvil smelled his socks , a sour smell like rotting hay . Without his boots , his feet felt naked . He wished the grandkids were around . He felt like hugging something close , feeling that soft baby skin . There was nothing he liked more than babies . Except for fishing . He loved fishing . He thought about the Old Man 's pond and wished that he were there right now . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd see something cooking , but there was nothing on the stove , nothing in the oven either . Luanne sat at the table , pouring pop into a glass . He heard it fizzing . Her hand shook . <p> " You want some supper ? " Orvil asked . <p> " I ai n't hungry , " said Luanne . " Too much on my mind , I guess . " <p> He found hot dogs in the fridge . Rinsing the pan , he wiped it dry and set it on the front burner . The hot dogs were the kind he liked , jumbo franks with thick red skin . He slit the plastic with a knife and slid them all into the skillet . <p> Grease sizzled as he shook the pan . Orvil liked the way it sounded . He felt better doing something , and Orvil liked to cook just as much as he liked eating . Every morning he got up at three to drive Luanne to Bunny Bread , where she worked on the bagging line , but first he 'd cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ham . In the dark it smelled so friendly . He always cooked enough for two , waking her when it was ready . Luanne , though , never ate a thing . " I 'll just rest , " she said each morning , and she 'd sit smoking , drinking pop just like she was now . <p> It was funny how things changed . These days she was skin and bone , but she 'd been big until last year , real big , and loved to eat . All her life she 'd loved to eat . They 'd been married thirty years , and known each other even longer , and he remembered the time back in school when she 'd brought him a pie , a cherry pie she 'd made herself , the crust all pretty , laid in strips . They were both in eighth grade then  --  eighth was as far as Orvil got  --  and he had been so touched that he cried . Orvil was n't used to kindness . What he mostly got was teased . <p> Sitting under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fingers , and afterwards her lips were red , shiny as if stained with blood . " Kiss me , " she said , so he did , tasting sweetness on his tongue . When they kissed , she closed her eyes . <p> With her eyes closed , she 'd looked pretty . Her cheeks were flushed , and she was trembling . Orvil knew that she 'd been desperate  --  choosing him she 'd have to be  --  and knowing made his heart go soft . Orvil had a tender heart . He hated seeing people hurt . <p> Luanne came over to the stove and poked her finger at the pan . Her nail was bitten down to the skin . It looked raw around the edge . <p> " What you cooking all those for ? " <p> " I did n't get no lunch today . There was three calves born last night , one his mama did n't want . Little bitty scrawny thing . Had to feed him with a bottle . " <p> Opening a can of beans , he dumped them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Outside , the rain was coming hard . He hoped the cows would be all right . He wished he 'd put them in the shed , even though the roof was leaking . <p> Luanne lit a cigarette . " Will you listen to that rain . TV says it 's supposed to stop , but what do they know . " She coughed . " Patti called awhile back , said she was coming out if Leroy lets her have the truck , but it do n't look like she can make it . I expect the road 's washed out . " <p> " She 'll get through , " said Orvil , pleased . <p> He loved his kids , all four , but Patti , the youngest , she was special . The first three were black-haired , strapping boys grown into men with laughs that started in their chests and knuckly wrists and thick , long legs . All three were farming now , all three married , all with kids , and all three made him real proud . Bur . Patti , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , it was red , a cloud of copper wire . Quick and bright and full of life , she made him think of fireflies . <p> " She bringing Twig " asked Orvil , hoping . <p> " Do n't see why not . She always does . The thing is , Orvil , he called her , told her he 's finished the boat , and she lives all the way in town . " <p> He poked the hot dogs with a fork , glad he 'd cooked them all . Patti , she liked hot dogs too . She liked to eat , though she was skinny . She had long legs and clean white teeth , and she worked in town for First Street Federal . <p> " She used to clean for him , " said Orvil . <p> " Three years ago , that do n't mean nothing . Unless , " she said , " he feels bad . That might be it . He sure was tight . " <p> " Could be , " said Orvil , " that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remember how he told her that , and she worked hard . They used to talk . Patti said he liked to talk , living up there all alone with his wife being dead and all . " The beans were hot . He watched them bubble . " You ever thought it might be that . He 's built the boat because he 's lonesome . " <p> " You do n't know the first thing . Boats get built so folks can USE them . Preacher says to look for signs . Well , he talks difference and he 's rich and if he 's lonely why 'd he come to live down here all by himself unless there was some special reason ? " <p> " He owns the quarry , " Orvil said . " Leastwise he did when he moved down . " <p> " You think you 're so smart , " she said , " but that do n't explain the boat . You know that man comes from the north , why , he goes back there every summer , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here are hills and creeks . " <p> " There 's his pond , " Orvil said . " The prettiest I ever saw . Lets me fish there all I want . Even lets me use his boat . He built that dinghy himself . " <p> " What 's that got to do with things ? " <p> " Signs , " said Orvil . " Like you said . " <p> " I swear you 're missing half a brain . That 's not the kind of sign I mean . Maybe if you went to church . It 's small things , they add up , like those cows that disappeared and who it was that stole my ginseng and that marijuana Shirlee found growing in her peas . Things like that , they do n't just happen . All this rain . You hear me , Orvil . " <p> " Sure , " said Orvil . <p> The way her eyes bugged made him sad . She did n't look good . She looked sick . He poured some beans into a bowl and forked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , damp and tickly . He wished he was holding Twig . Twig fit perfectly in his arms . She was nine months old , with big blue eyes like her mama and wispy hair the color of wheat . " She 's no bigger than a twig , " he 'd said the first time he saw her , and Patti said , " I 'll name her that , " and he had never felt so proud . <p> He settled at the table and shoveled beans into his mouth . There was comfort in the taste and in the softness on his tongue . His teeth were n't what they ought to be , so beans were restful . He liked beans . <p> Orvil liked the Old Man too , a stiff , tall man with thin white hair who bit his words off when he talked the way you chop worms for fishing . He talked as if it hurt his mouth , which meant he hardly talked at all , but Orvil never did mind quiet , and though he 'd never told Luanne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was nine years ago , not long after the Old Man had moved down , and Orvil was fishing one May evening when he heard a sound like grinding rocks coming through a stand of trees . He could n't make . out what it was , but it was rough , a kind of grating . Leaves were out like squirrels ' ears , and Orvil could n't see beyond them , so after awhile he rowed ashore and walked to where the sound came from . <p> In a clearing where a cabin had stood , white narcissus were blooming wild , and there he found the Old Man sitting , hands to his face and shoulders shaking . It was too late to back away . His eyes were dry , but he was crying . Trying to cry . His eyes looked cracked . <p> " Howdy , " Orvil said , and smiled . " It 's me . It 's Orvil . I been fishing . " <p> His heart ached . He could n't help it . Moving close he smelled the flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart ache more . The Old Man 's eyes were shattered glass . <p> " You want , " said Orvil , " I could row you . t sure is nice out on that pond . " <p> The Old Man coughed and cleared his throat . " It 's the flowers , " he said hoarsely . <p> " They smell good , " said Orvil , smiling , " and I like how they look like stars . " <p> The Old Man cleared his throat again . " Yes , " he said . " So did my wife . " <p> Orvil let the beans slide down , and as he did he heard the truck coming up the county road . The truck was old , but it ran smooth . Patti 's husband , Leroy , was a welder , and he was good at fixing things . <p> Orvil smiled . " Here she comes . " <p> Luanne frowned . " Driving too fast , like always . " <p> Orvil pushed his beans aside . When he stood up , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers and walked to the window . As he pulled the curtains back , he saw the truck , a big green Ford with dented sides , stop by the house . The rain was coming lighter now , a drizzle . He watched Patti climbing out , her bright hair burning like a flame . Holding Twig tight she ran toward the house . She looked happy . <p> " Here 's a nice surprise , " he said , and Patti , smiling , kissed his cheek . Her lips felt cool , like new spring leaves . <p> " Almost thought I would n't make it . The road 's washed out by Strickland 's place . " She thrust Twig into . Orvil 's arms . Cooing , Twig reached for his nose . <p> " You , " said Orvil . He was grinning . <p> " Hey , Mama , " said Patti . " How you been " She gave Luanne a quick , tight hug . <p> " I been better , " said Luanne . " How come you have to drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make you mad . " She knew how to tease her mother . <p> " You , " said Luanne , and almost smiled . <p> Patti walked to the stove , and Orvil felt the thick air stir . She was like a fresh west wind . Whenever she came , the house felt clean . <p> " Good , " she said . " You made a lot . " She filled two bowls with beans , and Luanne pulled up an extra chair . <p> " I 'm glad you came . We 've got to talk . " <p> " That 's why I 'm here . I told you that . " <p> She winked at Orvil , and he laughed , though he was n't sure just why . She set the bowls on the table , and Orvil sat , bouncing Twig on his knee to make her smile . He loved her smile , those baby teeth that looked like little pearls . <p> Patti sat down and started eating . Luanne sat , too , and stared at her like a bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " What did he say ? " <p> " Who ? " asked Patti . She looked puzzled . <p> " You know who . You talked last night . That 's when he said the boat 's all done , and Shirlee says it 's leaving next week , but what I want to know is how . A boat that big , who 's going to lift it ? " <p> Patti sighed . " Mama , what 's got into you I hate it when you talk like this . " <p> " Do n't you sass me , Patti Perkis . " <p> " Walker , Mama , I got married . " <p> " I do n't care what name you 're called , I 'm your mother , that 's what counts , and you had better tell me straight everything he 's said to you . " <p> " Mama , I already have , but what 's the point ? You never listen . " <p> " I listen well enough , " she said , " and I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named . Good News is what , it 's from the Bible . Gospel , girl . Now there 's a sign " She sat back . Her eyes were wild . They made her look blind . Orvil had to look away . He tried feeding Twig some beans , but she kept trying to grab the spoon . <p> " Mama , " said Patti . " Listen to me . I 'm going to tell you one more time . " She spoke slowly . " He 's named it for another boat , one he owned when he got married . A boat he bought , he did n't build , but that was called Good News too . When I worked there he showed me pictures . It 's a real old-fashioned . boat , a mackinaw , that 's what it 's called , and that 's the boat he 's building now . A replica . I told you that . I told you how they loved to sail , both of them , he and his wife . He sold the boat when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he moved down here . Her dying hurt him bad , I think , not that he would ever say . With him it 's what he does n't say , he never talks about his feelings , but I think he 's built that boat for her , a way of keeping her alive , and now it 's done , it 's going up . Next week a tractor-trailer 's coming to haul it to Michigan , where he plans to sail . That 's it . The end . You hear me , Mama ? " <p> " I ai n't deaf , " Luanne said , frowning , " but that do n't mean I heard the truth . Seems to me he 's got to lie . If he told us who he was , well , faith , it would n't count for nothing . It 's up to us to figure out . Why , if he told , that boat would sink " <p> " I give up , " said Patti , shrugging . She turned to Orvil with a grin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Orvil felt a funny twinge . " Sure I. do . " He cradled Twig against his chest , feeling her soft baby warmth . <p> " It 's good news , Daddy , real god . Yesterday I got promoted . " <p> " I knew you would , " said Orvil . " That means you can buy a house . " <p> " Not yet , " said Patti . " Not exactly . The thing is , see , we have to move . " <p> " What did I tell you , " Luanne said , smug . <p> Patti looked at her , confused . <p> " She thinks you mean the boat , " said Orvil . <p> " Come off it , Mama . It 's my job . The bank , " she said . " They want to send me to St. Louis so I can take their training program , and then they got a place for me , a real good one , in the city . " <p> She looked at Orvil . She was smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead tried to nod his head , but his neck seemed stuck ; it would n't move . He felt Twig 's small weight on his lap , so small that if he closed his eyes he would n't know she was there . He wrapped his arms around her and felt her trying to wriggle loose . <p> " Is n't that something , " Luanne said . She sounded only half-convinced . <p> " Sure is , " said Orvil , trying to smile . " I guess that means you , have to move . " <p> " Daddy , that 's just what I said " <p> " When " said Orvil , his throat tight . <p> " Soon , " said Patti . " The program starts the middle of May , so we 're going out next week to look . " <p> Luanne hunched forward . " Ai n't that when the boat is leaving ? " <p> " Mama , forget that boat . I thought you 'd be proud of me " <p> " We are , " said Orvil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what hurts . " <p> " I 'll be back to visit , " she said . " It only takes four hours to drive , and you can come and visit too . " <p> Orvil tried to think of that , of getting in the truck and driving on straight , gray highways , heading west . Just thinking of it made him dizzy . He 'd never been beyond Dongola . He looked out . The rain had stopped . <p> Patti stood . " I got to go . " <p> " But you just got here , " Luanne said . Her neck looked plucked . A chicken 's neck . Loose skin wobbled when she talked . <p> Patti reached out , lifting Twig , and Orvil felt his lap go light . <p> " I only came so I could tell you . Leroy needs the truck for work . Mama , you take care , " she said . She kissed her cheek like it was glass . <p> " I 'll walk you out , " said Orvil , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber squeaked . The boots were damp . It took awhile to get them on , and when he straightened , he was sweating . Outside , everything was dim and gray . Everything but Patti 's hair , glistening . He felt a tightness in his chest . <p> " Honey , I 'm sure going to miss you . " <p> Twig in one arm , Patti hugged him . " Me too , Daddy , " she said softly . Hugging him , she pressed her face into his neck . <p> " Daddy , " she said , " what 's wrong with Mama How come she 's carrying on like this ? " <p> " I think she 's scared , " said Orvil . " Scared of dying , but she do n't know it . You noticed she do n't look too good , but I ai n't smart , I might be wrong . " <p> Patti gave his neck a squeeze . " I think you 're smart enough , " she said . She climbed into the truck , rolled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " Orvil said . <p> He waved until the truck was gone and then stood awhile staring at nothing . It was awful how he felt , but he did n't want to go back in . He knew Luanne was in there , waiting . <p> He started walking up the drive , past the shed and the cows . He did n't think where he was going . The hill was steep , and he was puffing . He knew he ought to lose some weight . He walked slowly past the barn , thinking of the boat inside . He 'd never seen a boat that big , never seen much of anything . Not like Luanne . She 'd been around , to St. Louis and Chicago . She was proud of that . The doors were closed . He could n't see it , but he imagined how it looked , with sails like clouds , that big and white . <p> He wished he were sailing now , floating on the Old Man 's pond . He did n't need to catch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way the water rippled , the way light sprinkled through the leaves . He was happy just being still . <p> Doing nothing , Luanne said , but all his life he 'd been like that . Lazy is what Luanne said . Even his name she said was lazy , more a dribble than a spit . He supposed she might be right , but that had been his Daddy 's doing . Six kids was all his Mama wanted , and Orvil was the last of seven . His rightful name was Orville , but on the day he 'd been born his Daddy , drunk , wrote Orvil , and all his life the name had stuck . <p> The drive curved down toward the house , and when he reached the steps he stopped . He was n't sure why he was here , and all that walking had made him sweat . He needed time to catch his breath , but right away the door swung open . <p> The Old Man stood tall and straight in a crisp white shirt and khaki pants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . " <p> Orvil cleared his throat . " I do n't want to bother you . " <p> " You are n't , " he said . " I 've finished dinner . The coffee 's ready . There 's enough . Come on in and have a cup . " <p> " My boots , " said Orvil , looking down . <p> " Just scrape them off . " <p> Orvil did , and walked into the hall . The floor was smooth black stone , and straight ahead there was a table . Above the table hung a mirror , and in it Orvil saw his face . It looked awful , fat and red . He smoothed his hair with his hands , wishing he had worn his cap . <p> A door off the hall led into the kitchen , a big , bright room with sliding glass doors and a deck that looked over hills and fields . The Old Man stood by the stove , pouring coffee into cups . Orvil , awkward , shifted his weight . His shirt was sticking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a table with two chairs . In front of one a book was open . <p> " Looks like you were busy reading . " <p> " I can read any time I want . I talked to Patti yesterday , and I 've been wanting to talk to you . Sit down , " he said . " I 'll bring the coffee . " <p> The chair legs creaked as Orvil sat , skinny chairs with wicker seats , but it felt good to sit again . The smell of coffee filled the room , and out the windows it looked brighter . The Old . Man set down the cups . " Cream and sugar ? " <p> " No thanks , " said Orvil , though he wanted both . Both was what he always had , but the cups had coffee to the top , and they looked thin enough to break . If he stirred in sugar , his just might , and Orvil did n't want to risk it . <p> The Old Man sat down and smiled . When he smiled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of Patti . She told me yesterday , when I called . " <p> Orvil looked down at his cup , at his fingers holding it . His fingers looked like fat , red worms . " Yes , sir , I am . " <p> " Orvil , please , do n't call me sir . " <p> " No , sir , " said Orvil . <p> They both laughed . Orvil felt a little better . <p> " Call me Bill . Your daughter does . Unless , " he said , eyes sparking , " you 'd rather call me the Old Man . " <p> Orvil felt his face grow hot . " She should n't have gone and told you that . " <p> " She 's told me a lot of things . She 's one fine girl . You should be proud . " <p> " She should n't have told you , " Orvil said . " lt was n't meant to . be unkind . " <p> " I 'm aware of that , " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ? They seldom see me . " Thoughtfully , he sipped his coffee , looking at Orvil over the rim . His eyes were a pale , unflinching blue . His fingertips were square and clean . " I understand that you 're upset . " <p> Startled , Orvil stared at him , wondering how he had known . The Old Man 's eyes were still as stone , but he was waiting . That was clear . Carefully Orvil set down his cup . He felt a gnawing in his chest . <p> " It 's hard , " he said . " It 's hard to lose her . " The Old Man frowned . <p> " I 'm proud all right , " said Orvil , quickly , " but the thing is that I 'm going to miss her . That girl means a lot to me , and Twiggie too . I like to hold her . Just holding her , it feels good . " <p> Orvil smiled , at least he tried to , but his mouth kept turning down . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never thought ... I never been too good at thinking . Never good at much , I guess . " His eyes went misty . Orvil wiped them . <p> " Anyhow . " He cleared his throat . " That 's not what I come about , but I sure am grateful for all you done , those books you let her read and all . It meant a lot to her , I know . " <p> The Old Man looked him in the eye . " As do you , " he said . " I hope you 're aware of that . " <p> Orvil blushed , looked away . Outside he saw the mist was lifting . Above the hills the sky was pink . " If you do n't mind ... " He cleared his throat . " I 've come , " he said , " to ask a favor . It ai n't much , at least I hope , but it 's about that boat you built . I sure hate to ask for things , but I 'm wondering if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it once before it goes . She 's got her heart set on it , so I just thought I 'd come and ask . " <p> The Old Man nodded . " So I gather . " <p> Orvil blinked . " You mean you heard ? " <p> " A slightly different version , " he said . " You 're the one who wants to come . According to your wife , that is . " <p> Orvil 's face went red again . " You mean she told you this already ? " <p> " Yesterday , at the mailbox . She came out when I was there . " <p> Orvil looked down at his hands . " I feel dumb , not knowing she 'd asked . I guess you told her no is why . " <p> " Actually , I did n't , " he said . " I did n't tell her anything . Frankly , I did n't get a chance . Your wife is quite a talker , Orvil . " <p> " I guess she is , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your time . " He stood up , sweating . The Old Man raised his hand to stop him . <p> " There 's no need to apologize . You come up anytime you want . " <p> " That 's real kind of you , " said Orvil . " She 'll be happy when she hears . " <p> " I 'm afraid she 's going to be disappointed . " <p> " She wo n't , " said Orvil . " Her heart 's set . " <p> " I mean by what she 's going to find . The boat 's not what she thinks it is . Nor am I. " He smiled , briefly . <p> Orvil stared at him , surprised . " She did n't tell you that herself ? " <p> " Patti , on the phone last night . I have to confess it startled me . Flattered as I was , of course . " <p> It was hard to tell if he was joking . <p> " She 'd be upset to know you 'd heard . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Man took a careful sip . A thoughtful sip . He looked at Orvil over his cup . " Perhaps , " he said , " I should n't say this , but Orvil , I admire you . Your wife is not an easy woman . " <p> Orvil shrugged and looked away . The sky was purple , like a plum . It made him think of something bruised . " She 's a human being , " he said , " and she do n't like to be left out . All her life she 's felt left out . Being saved made her feel special , but : trouble was it did n't last . Always wanting something more , like there 's this hole that ca n't get filled , and marrying me , that did n't help . She always thought she could d better . " <p> " That 's what I mean , " the Old Man said . " She does n't know how lucky she is . " <p> " But she do n't feel lucky , " said Orvil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not from the kids , from anything , and I ca n't help but feel bad for her . All she 's missing , that 's what hurts . " <p> Turning , he looked out the window . The hills were shadows . There were stars . <p> " Like how I feel when I 'm fishing , just sitting there and being a part . Of everything . The sky and pond , and everything , it looks so peaceful , why , sometimes I just want to cry . " He cleared his throat and smiled , shyly . " Maybe sailing 's like that too . Must be something just to sit and let the wind do all the work . Once on the pond I saw a swan , drifting quiet , white and full . Just like a sail is what thought . I bet it 's a pretty sight . " <p> " Yes , " said the Old Man . " Yes , it is . " His voice was soft . So were his eyes . " I like o go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I sure would like that , " Orvil said . <p> Together they went out the door . It was dark , and mist was rising . A whippoorwill called from the trees . <p> " Look , " said Orvil . " There 's a moon . " <p> There had n't been a moon for weeks , at least not one they could see . The drive shone silver in the light , and everything looked cool and wet . They walked in silence , which suited Orvil ; he was tired . <p> When they reached the barn , the Old Man slid the doors wide , and inside Orvil saw the boat , at least the shape of it , curved like a woman , big and dark . It was set high on boards , thick , fat logs to hold the weight , but it looked light , like it was floating . <p> " Is n't that something , " Orvil said . <p> " You ca n't see anything out here . Come on in . We 'll climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The barn smelled of wood and paint , a cool , clean smell that Orvil liked , a smell that made him think of water . Against the boat was a ladder . The Old Man climbed , and Orvil followed , thinking the boat might rock , but the logs were steady underneath . Carefully he clambered on board into a wide and open space . <p> " This is the cockpit , " the Old Man said , " and those are the masts lying on the deck . In Michigan I 'll rig the sails , but except for the rigging everything 's done . The engine 's in , and the centerboard . Up forward 's the cuddy where we slept , and there 's the tiller , in the stern . " <p> Orvil saw a curve of wood about the size of a baseball bat . " That little thing steers this big boat ? " <p> The Old Man smiled . " It certainly does . " <p> " Is n't that something , " Orvil said . <p> He sat down beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wooden handle was smooth , like baby 's skin . When he pushed it , he heard creaking . It made him think of someone crying . <p> He could n't believe he was here , sitting in this great big boat , sitting right at the tiller like it was his . The doors were open , and through them he could see the moon , or anyway he saw the light spilling in to fill the shed . He liked the way it turned things silver . Way up high he saw stars that looked like they were moving , but they were n't moving . It was wind ; he saw it stirring in the trees . Orvil smelled the new , green grass , a smell as sweet as baby 's breath , and felt his heart begin to ache . <p> He thought how wind would fill the sails , round silver sails like the moon , and Orvil pushed the tiller sideways , steering the boat toward the doors , and as he did he felt it rock , a gentle motion back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was late . She must be sleeping . He pictured her in her crib , small fingers curled , her milkweed hair , and he felt something squeeze his heart , squeeze it hard , not letting go . <p> It seemed to Orvil he was floating . <p> He closed his eyes and thought of Noah , how he had floated all that time , looking for a place to land , thinking how hard that must have been , not knowing when or if he 'd find it . Life , he thought , was like that too , not knowing what you 'd find , or lose , but just like Noah you kept hopeful , lived each moment as it came . <p> He thought to tell the Old Man that , but Orvil bet : he knew already , and besides his chest felt full of pins . <p> So he kept sailing . He liked that . He liked the creak of wood and rope , the sweet , cool air , the gentle lifting as Good News sailed out the doors with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
