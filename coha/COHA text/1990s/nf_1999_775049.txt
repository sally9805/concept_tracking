Ambitious Adolescents // Ted and Sue Marshall have three children ; their eldest , Sarah , is a junior in college . Sarah was a good student in high school and according to her teachers had shown " some real talent in writing and art design . " Sarah 's dream was to become the fashion editor for a chic , international publication like Elle , her favorite magazine . // For Sarah , however , it was little more than a dream . She had not taken any steps to learn more about the worlds of fashion or publishing . She had not pursued an internship at Arnold 's , a local book publishing company , volunteered to do costume design for the high school play , submitted articles for the school newspaper , or enrolled in art classes outside of school . // Sarah did , however , spend a lot of time deciding which college to attend . The decision process had been lengthy and costly . In the fall of her junior year , Sarah took the Princeton Review course to prepare for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully followed the high school 's guidelines for preparing for college and went to the school 's special programs for college admissions , including the college fairs . She met with the school 's college counselor , who recommended several colleges based on her interests , listed some teachers to ask for recommendation letters , and handed her a pamphlet on how to fill out college application forms . // Sarah 's parents spent little time talking with her about how to pursue a career as a fashion editor , what types of colleges offered appropriate programs , and what courses she should take in college . They did , however , spend considerable resources on helping Sarah select the " right " college . They hired a private college counselor , who recommended seven schools based on Sarah 's SAT and ACT scores , her junior-class rank , and her interest in fashion and writing . Two of the colleges on the list were " reach schools , " where Sarah was unlikely to be admitted , and two others were " safety schools , " places that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " real possibilities . " // In the spring of her junior year , Sarah , her mother , and her father visited seven colleges across the United States . During the trip , she " fell in love " with a college on the East Coast . Ranked one of the best liberal arts colleges in the country , the school had an outstanding reputation in the humanities . Sarah was especially interested in the college because of its close proximity to a major city . Following these campus visits , she made a personal ranking of the schools and began the time-consuming process of applying . Her second choice was not as competitive as the first , but it had a good program in English . She also applied to the remaining five colleges , but her hopes were set on attending her first choice . // The acceptance and rejection letters arrived in the spring of her senior year . Sarah received four of the dreaded thin letters . She had not been admitted to her first , second , or third choices and was wait-listed at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at a large state university . Devastated by the rejections , Sarah decided to enroll in one of her safety schools , a small private college in Ohio , where she planned to major in English . // The costs of selecting and attending this college were significant . They included the private counselor ( $2,500 ) , college admissions preparation classes ( $700 ) , trips to visit colleges ( $1,750 ) , and college application fees for the seven schools ( $280 ) . The actual bill for attending the college for a year was more than the cost of a moderately priced car ; to obtain a bachelor 's degree in four years , the total would exceed $100,000 . Because of her parents ' middle-class income , Sarah was not eligible for financial aid , and she did not receive any scholarship assistance . Her parents were concerned whether she was " making the right choice , " given the high costs of the college and her ambivalence about attending one of her safety schools . Their concerns were well founded . // When Sarah enrolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soon learned that it offered few courses in art or fashion design . In her first semester , she found the English classes very difficult and changed her major to communications . But this decision also proved to be a mistake : the communications courses seemed uninteresting , so she changed her major again , to business . Now a junior , Sarah remains enrolled in the college but still is unsure what she wants to study . She has already changed her major twice and will need an additional semester to earn her bachelor 's degree . Sarah feels she has made poor choices . She is not sure this college was the best one for her and worries that she will be unable to find a job after graduating . // Why Study Adolescent Ambitions ? // Sarah 's ambitions are similar to those of many American adolescents in the 1990s . Large numbers of them expect to become physicians , lawyers , and business managers ; few want to work as machinists , secretaries , or plumbers . Such high ambitions are held by teenagers from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hispanic , and white . More adolescents than ever expect to graduate from college , earn graduate degrees , and work in the white-collar world of professionals . They are America 's most ambitious teenage generation ever . // Popular media images often portray adolescents as " slackers , " drug users , and perpetrators of violent crimes . The overwhelming majority of teenagers , however , graduate from high school , do not use hard drugs , are not criminals , and do not father or have babies while still in their teens . Many of them are willing to work hard to get good grades and assume this will make them eligible for scholarships at the college they plan to attend . Most young people are worried about their futures and believe attaining a college degree is critical for finding a first real job . The bachelor 's degree is seen as the necessary first step in moving up the economic and social ladder . Many consider graduate and professional degrees essential . // Although very ambitious , many adolescents find it very difficult to fulfill their dreams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help them achieve their ambitions . Often their ambitions are dreamlike and not realistically connected to specific educational and career paths . Regardless of how hard they try , they may find themselves , like Sarah , " running in place and unsure where to go . " In this book , we examine the ambitions of today 's adolescents . We explore why adolescents are so ambitious and what influences the formation of their ambitions . We describe how some ambitions are more useful to them than others and the advantages of ambitions anchored in an understanding of the relationship between educational credentials and later labor market opportunities . // Ambitions are an important part of the lives of adolescents . Whether realistic or not , they help teenagers make sense of their lives and their futures . They can use their ambitions like a compass to help chart a life course and to provide direction for spending their time and energy . Ambitions can increase the chances that adolescents will take schoolwork seriously , gain admission to the college of their choice , and view their success as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lifelong significance ; they influence career choices and future earnings . Decades of research demonstrate that one of the most important early predictors of social mobility is how much schooling an adolescent expects to obtain . // Young people understand that the jobs available to today 's high school graduates are likely to be parking cars , filling orders , and moving boxes . Completing a college education is a gateway to more prestigious jobs and higher earnings . The ambitions of today 's adolescents reflect these realities and raise some important issues . Why are ambitions rising ? What are adolescents ' views of their futures ? How do the ambitions of teenagers influence the choices they make during high school and after graduation ? What role do schools and families play in shaping their ambitions ? // Today more than 90 percent of high school seniors expect to attend college , and more than 70 percent expect to work in professional jobs . Four decades ago , the picture was quite different , with only 55 percent expecting to attend college and approximately 42 percent expecting to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be understood through studying the lives of adolescents . Using portraits of six of them , three from the 1950s and three from the 1990s , we describe these changes in the lives of teenagers . The social world of high school students in the 1950s helped to prepare them to take on adult responsibilities after high school graduation , and the transition from adolescence to adulthood was brief . Soon after high school , many teenagers assumed the social obligations of marriage and parenthood and , for most males , the responsibility of being the sole full-time wage earner in the family . These are not the concerns of the adolescents of the 1990s. // In the 1990s , the transition to adulthood takes much longer . Most young people do not take on full-time jobs after high school . Instead , they enroll in college , where many of them will remain for more than four years . They are likely to leave school later , marry later , and have children later . This elongated transition is filled with a series of decisions that will have consequences for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What college to attend ? What type of work to prepare for ? Making these choices opens up new opportunities as well as closing off others . Without a coherent plan , adolescents can find such choices overwhelming and less than meaningful . // Are Today 's Adolescents Too Ambitious ? // Pursuing a college education is a pervasive desire of today 's adolescents . It is fair to ask whether they want more education than is necessary . We find that almost half of these teenagers hope to get degrees that exceed the credentials needed for the occupations they want . It could be that these adolescents foresee a rise in the educational credentials required for today 's jobs , and there is some evidence that jobs that are now available to high school graduates may soon require a bachelor 's degree . Such a trend is apparent in police work , where the requirement for becoming a police officer in some major cities has increased from a high school diploma to a college degree . As a generation , today 's adolescents desire to be professionals in numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2005 . Six times more adolescents want to be doctors and five times more want to be lawyers than there are projected to be openings in these professions . // Some high school graduates in the 1990s do not attend college immediately after high school . However , unlike those in the 1950s , today 's high school graduates are not likely to obtain well-paying jobs that can lead to long-term , stable employment . The jobs they can get pay poorly and provide few opportunities for career promotion . Facing such job prospects , high school graduates who have entered the workforce hold on to their dreams of attending college and obtaining additional training and skills . // Some adolescents have educational and occupational goals that are complementary . We describe these teenagers as having aligned ambitions . Students with aligned ambitions know the type of job they want and how much education is needed to get it . Adolescents with aligned ambitions are more likely to select a path or construct a life plan that enhances their chances of reaching their occupational goals . Life plans are important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such plans vary in form , however . We have found that life plans that are coherent with detail and realism are especially useful for choosing a path that increases the probability of success in adulthood . They provide adolescents with a sense of order , encourage them to engage in strategic effort and to sustain high levels of motivation , and help them to use familial and organizational resources . // Most high school students are like Sarah : they have high ambitions but no clear life plans for reaching them . We describe these adolescents as having misaligned ambitions . These " drifting dreamers " have limited knowledge about their chosen occupations , about educational requirements , or about future demand for these occupations . Without such information , their life plans are not realistic and are often ill formed . Drifting dreamers are found among boys and girls and all racial and ethnic groups . // Why do some students have aligned ambitions and others misaligned ambitions ? We look at two important influences in the formation of aligned ambitions : the school and the family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of aligned ambitions ? Are some schools more effective than others ? We compare three types of high schools and describe what actions they take to help students make the transition from high school to college or work . We also explain why some high schools are more effective in helping students develop plans than others . // Today 's parents share their adolescents ' high ambitions . Although many parents have high educational expectations for their children , they often fail to draw meaningful connections between educational credentials and future work opportunities . Sarah 's parents expended considerable money and effort on the college application process . Are there better ways to spend time and resources ? What role do parents need to take in helping to form their adolescents ' ambitions , and how can they assist their teenagers in strategically organizing and managing their lives around college and work opportunities ? Contrary to popular descriptions of teenagers as uninterested in the opinions of their parents , we find that they desire support and direction from their parents in planning their futures . But many parents do not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans for their futures . Parents are willing to depend on the high schools and colleges to assume that role . // Nearly all adolescents have a paying job during their high school years . What role do teenage jobs , such as fast-food server , salesclerk , and grocery bagger , play in the formation of ambitions ? What types of work experiences influence the development of ambitions ? What jobs influence the decisions adolescents make about their futures ? // Unlike teenagers in the 1950s , these adolescents do not have long-lasting peer group friendships . They spend considerable periods outside of school alone ; they have few friends for longer than several months ; few have steady girlfriends or boyfriends ; and some even claim not to have a best friend . The social groups they belong to are very fluid , and teenagers move easily from group to group . What effect does spending time alone have on teenage ambitions ? What influence do peer groups have on the shaping of ambitions ? Are there teenage peer activities that can help the formation of ambitions ? // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin college at a two-year or a four-year institution . More students who expect to obtain a bachelor 's or graduate degree are deciding to begin their college studies at two-year institutions . Unfortunately , this decision creates what we describe as an ambition paradox  --  students with high ambitions choosing an educational route with low odds of success . Students with misaligned ambitions are more likely to be caught in this ambition paradox . We describe how these students adapt to this problem and discuss what parents , high schools , and colleges can do to prevent students from being caught in this paradox . // To understand how the ambitions of today 's adolescents are formed and are different from previous generations , we draw upon many different data sources . The stories of today 's adolescents are taken from the Alfred P. Sloan Study of Youth and Social Development . The Sloan study is the most detailed and comprehensive national study of adolescents in the 1990s . More than a thousand adolescents in twelve different geographical locations around the country participated in this five-year longitudinal study of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adolescents from all regions of the United States were followed as they changed schools or residences , graduated from high school , and went on to work or college . The sampling frame for the Sloan study was designed to assure a racially and ethnically diverse sample that was representative of American teenagers nationwide . In addition to the students who were followed for five years , information was also collected from other students in the sample schools . All together , more than seven thousand students participated in the study . // The Sloan study collected many different types of information about adolescents and their lives . This information was gathered through multiple interviews conducted over five years with the adolescents and their parents , teachers , and school administrators ; field studies of their schools and communities ; questionnaires surveying adolescents ' perceptions and attitudes toward their schools , friends , and futures , ascertaining their school performance , including grades and courses taken , and assessing their knowledge about the world of work ; and measures of how adolescents spend their time . When the study began in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and high school ; by now most have made the transition from high school to college or work . // The rich , comprehensive qualitative data from the Sloan study were used to create the 1990s case studies in this book . What is perhaps most unusual about these data is that the in-depth interviews are longitudinal and conducted at key transitional points . From the cases we see how students weighed their postsecondary choices , whether their experiences in college met their expectations , and how they are planning for their futures . The dreams and life plans of these thousand adolescents , woven into a shared biography , form the story of this book . // The Sloan Study of Youth and Social Development is part of the University of Chicago tradition of studying the lives of adolescents . During the 1950s , several researchers at the university carried out landmark community studies of adolescents and published their findings in important books , including Robert Havighurst 's Growing Up in River City and James Coleman 's The Adolescent Society . These two studies are elaborately detailed , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adolescent in the 1950s . The Havighurst study was particularly rich in case materials on selected adolescents when they were in high school and five years later . We were fortunate to uncover many of the original case materials from the Havighurst study in the archival collection of the University of Chicago 's Regenstein Library . From these case materials we created our portraits of adolescents in the 1950s . We relied on the Coleman data to contrast the values and friendship ties in high schools of the 1950s and the 1990s. // Another major study of adolescents in the Chicago tradition was conducted by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Reed Larson in the 1980s . The resulting work , Being Adolescent , introduced a new methodology  --  the experience sampling method  --  for studying the daily lives of adolescents . This methodology was used in the Sloan study and made it possible to compare how young people spend their time , how they perceive the quality of their experiences , and what they wish they could do in the future . // To trace changes in adolescent ambitions , we conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950s , 1960s , 1970s , 1980s , and 1990s . Sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics and the National Science Foundation , these comprehensive studies used rigorous sampling techniques and were based on samples of tens of thousands of adolescents . Results from these data sets serve as benchmarks for comparing the findings from the Sloan study . It is this combination of multiple data sources  --  current and historical and qualitative and quantitative  --  that we use to make our case about the importance of adolescent ambitions . // Today 's teenagers see their future work lives as filled with promise and uncertainty . They believe in the value of technology , in the importance of being flexible , and in the need for specialization ; they also believe that they will change jobs frequently and change careers occasionally . Teenagers accept the volatility of the labor market and believe that the way to create a personal safety net is to obtain additional education . This focus on postsecondary education as a form of security helps to explain the dramatic rise in ambitions . It also makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reaching their dreams . Small choices , such as which courses to take in high school , can influence their preparation for college , and other choices , such as whether to enroll in a two-year or four-year college , can influence their chances of earning a bachelor 's degree . Unfortunately , many adolescents make uninformed choices , and the costs of making poor choices can be great . Sarah chose a college that did not offer what she wanted to study ; she changed her major several times ; and she is about to finish college with little idea of what she wants to do . Sarah and many other adolescents do not have meaningful life plans to help guide them in making choices . Many , like Sarah , believe that college is necessary to obtain a decent job . The time and energy young people put into going to college and the resources and effort their parents and schools expend in helping them make the transition can be substantial . Many of these efforts , however , focus on a single objective  --  getting into college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
