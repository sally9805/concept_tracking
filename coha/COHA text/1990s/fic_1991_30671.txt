Chapter One&lt; Whitneyville , Idaho Territory April 15 , 1878 The keening whine of the train whistle deepened Emma Chalmers ' despair at the ending of Anna Karenina , and she sniffled as she slammed the book closed . She then hastily dried her eyes with a wadded handkerchief trimmed in blue tatting and smoothed the skirts of her prim brown sateen dress . Grabbing up a new supply of posters she 'd just had printed over at the newspaper office , Emma dashed for the door . The Whitneyville Lending Library was empty , and she did n't bother to lock up , since no one she knew would have stooped so low as to steal a book , and she 'd collected only two cents in fines . She saw a slim figure reflected back to her as she passed the spotless windows of the general store . Emma quickened her steps , as it had been her experience that some of the conductors and stagecoach drivers would evade her if given the opportunity . As she passed the Yellow Belly Saloon , with its peeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sawdust and beer and sweat came out to wrap themselves around her like an insidious vine . Emma broke into a ladylike sprint , clutching her posters to her shapely bosom with one hand and keeping her skirts out of the dirt and tobacco juice on the sidewalk with the other . Her bright hair , pulled into a single thick plait , swung as she ran . The railroad yard was crowded with arriving and departing passengers . Most were human , but there were some pigs and horses and an occasional crate of squawking chickens . Emma picked her way through the throng as daintily as she could , and with a practiced eye sought out the conductor . A well-fed man with a ruddy complexion and thick white hair , he was half-hidden behind a shipment of canned meats bound for the general store . After clearing her throat , a sound barely discernible in the din , Emma approached . " Good afternoon , Mr. Lathrop , " she said politely . " Miss Emma , " Mr. Lathrop answered with a nod of his bushy head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm afraid there 's no news today . It just seems like nobody in this whole part of the country knows anything about your sisters . " Even though she 'd expected this answer  --  after all , she 'd gotten virtually the same one every week for nearly thirteen years  --  Emma was stricken , for a moment , with the purest of sorrow . " If  --  if you would just pass these bills out , as you go along  --  " Mr. Lathrop accepted the stack of crisply printed placards and held one up , with great ceremony , for his pensive perusal . It read : REWARD ! $500 CASH ! For any information leading to the location of MISS CAROLINE CHALMERS , dark of hair and eyes , or MISS LILY CHALMERS , fair , and having brown eyes . Please contact MISS EMMA CHALMERS In care of the Whitneyville Lending Library Whitneyville , Idaho Territory " Perhaps I should have said ' thank you ' , " Emma fretted , bending around Mr. Lathrop 's ample shoulder to read the bold print . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain enough that you 'd be grateful for any help , Miss Emma . " She sighed . " Sometimes it just seems hopeless . Sort of like the ending of Anna Karenina . Have you read that book , Mr. Lathrop ? " He looked bewildered . " Not so as I remember , Miss Emma . A man does n't get much chance to read when he spends his days on the rails . " Emma nodded soberly as she handed over the rest of the posters . " I suppose not . The noise would be powerfully distracting , I should think . " It was Mr. Lathrop 's solemn duty to see that pigs and people found their proper places aboard the train . Therefore , he left Emma , her posters in his arms , after favoring her with a little tip of his hat . Every Christmas , Emma remembered him with a pair of knitted socks and a box of walnut fudge , and she wondered now if that was proper recompense for a man who had tried so steadfastly to be helpful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and departing passengers , for she 'd never stopped hoping to find one of her sisters among them . Walking alongside the track , she nearly collided with a ramp extending from one of the boxcars . Not to mention the man and horse coming down that ramp . Emma gave a startled gasp and leaped backwards , while the man smiled at her from the saddle and touched the brim of his battered hat . He looked like a seedy saddlebum , with no gentle qualities to recommend him , and yet Emma felt a not unpleasant tug in the pit of her stomach as she returned his regard . " You ought to look where you 're going , " she said crisply . Controlling his mount with barely perceptible movements of his gloved hands , the stranger urged the nervous horse into the dirt and cinders at the side of the tracks . Apparently , he found the fact that Emma had taken umbrage very amusing , because he was still grinning , his teeth wickedly white against a sun-browned , beard-stubbled face . He gave a mocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladyship , " he said . Then he let out a low hoot of laughter and rode off . Emma smoothed her hair , then sighed as she lifted her skirts and started back the way she 'd come . It seemed to her that no one bothered to cultivate good manners any longer . Because something about the man on the horse had disturbed her , Emma forcibly shifted her mind to the search for her sisters . Even if she came face to face with Lily or Caroline , she thought in despair , she might not recognize them . People could change so much in thirteen years . They would be grown women now . Emma did not come out of her reverie until she was passing the First Territorial Bank . Through the window , she spotted Fulton Whitney , who made no secret of the fact that he aspired to be her husband . He was tall and blond and he looked very handsome in his gray pin-striped trousers , with a vest over his white linen shirt , and there was a gentlemanly garter on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she went on walking , knowing Fulton would be displeased if she slipped inside the bank to speak to him . Business was business , he always said , and Emma belonged to another part of his life . Emma frowned as she continued along the sidewalk . Sometimes Fulton made her feel like a straw hat stuck away on a wardrobe shelf for the winter , and it worried her that her pulse never quickened when she looked at him . Lifting her skirts again , Emma looked both ways and then crossed the road , wishing to avoid further contact with the Yellow Belly Saloon . It was so much pleasanter to look at the shining blue waters of Crystal Lake , hardly more than a stone 's throw from the main street of town . Fulton firmly believed that Whitneyville would someday be a thriving resort city because of that enormous and beautiful lake , and he 'd invested his money accordingly . Chloe had chosen the town for the same reason . Cheery music flowed from the Stardust Saloon , and Emma marked the spritely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the library . She found the place empty , as usual , and was just putting Anna Karenina back on the shelf when a thunderous explosion rocked the walls and rattled the windows in their frames . Emma 's heart did a startled double beat as she hurried to the front door to look out , fully expecting to see the Lord Himself riding on a cloud above , surrounded by His angels . The world had ended , and it only remained to be seen whether she would be taken to heaven or left behind to swim in a lake of fire . But there was n't a cloud in the sky , and there was certainly no sign of the Lord . Emma was quite relieved , for there were those who said she was as much a sinner as Chloe and there might not have been space for her in Glory . People were running past her in the street , and shouts of excitement rose all around . The fire bell was clanging , and Emma caught the acrid scent of smoke . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that the Yellow Belly Saloon was nearly in ruins . Its front had completely disappeared , showing the men inside draped over tables like rag dolls forgotten in a playhouse . And there was a fire , picking up momentum with every passing second . For all the clanging clamor of the bell , Emma could see no sign of the fire wagon , with its long hoses and special pump . She pressed closer to watch as townsmen dragged the injured out into the crowded street . " Get back ! " shouted Doc Waverly , who had never been known for his patient nature . " Get back , damn it , and give these poor bastards some air ! " Emma 's cheeks heated at the doctor 's language , but she remained where she was . It was as though she were helping somehow , just by being there . Although she stood on tiptoe , she could n't get a good look at any of the wounded men , but she did see Chloe and her girls flowing across the street from the Stardust Saloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What the hell happened here , Doc ? " Ethan Peters , the editor of the Whitneyville Orator , wanted to know . " I 've got no idea , " answered the bristly old man who had been mending broken limbs and removing bullets and infected toenails in Whitneyville almost since the day of its founding , " and do n't get in our way . When somebody knows the story , we 'll damned well tell you about it ! " Emma bit her lip briefly as she watched some of the men carrying the wounded , under Doc Waverly 's supervision , into the Stardust Saloon . She got as close as she could , but even now , at the age of twenty , Emma did n't dare defy Chloe 's standing order that she never set foot inside the place . She waited on the sidewalk until all the excitement had died down , until the smoldering remains of the Yellow Belly Saloon were drenched in water pumped from the lake , and then she went slowly back to the library . Emma stayed there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two of Little Women whenever she got the chance . People came in and out all afternoon , but none of them seemed to know any more about the calamity at the Yellow Belly Saloon than Emma did . At five o'clock sharp she closed the library door , locked it with a long brass key , and set out for home . If there was one person in the whole town , besides Doc , who would know the complete story , it was Chloe . A fine film of sweat lay over Steven Fairfax 's body when he came to . He saw a papered wall with blue flowers on it , and a pair of lace curtains that seemed to be trying to blend into each other . He started to sit up , but the pain stopped him , squeezing his ribcage like a giant fist . He fell back onto the pillows with a muttered curse and felt at his hip for the Colt .45 he was never without . It was gone , holster and all . His first instinct was to bellow a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't know exactly where he was , or what had happened to him . There was a damn good chance that his half brother , Macon , had finally caught up with him . Breathing hard , he tried to think . To remember . Slowly , the events of the day began to come back to him . He 'd come into town on the train , left his horse in a livery stable , and looked for a place to have a drink and wash the soot from his throat . He 'd wandered into a hole called the Yellow Belly , partly because its name had made him smile , and partly because he was too damned dirty for the Stardust , which looked like it might offer gentler comforts . He 'd ordered a whiskey and sat down alone at a table in the rear , following his rule of always keeping his back to the wall so no one could sneak up behind him . He 'd learned that lesson in the war , and it had stood him in good stead ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his whiskey  --  he remembered a slight chagrin at the realization that a glass of cold lemonade would have tasted better  --  when the drunk weaved in through a back entrance , singing at the top of his lungs . Nobody had paid much attention , including Steven . It was only when the man climbed up onto a table and started singing a birthday song that Steven began to take notice . The old codger was holding a stick of dynamite in one hand . " This here 's my birthday , " he announced to the quiet revelers . Then , incredibly , he struck a match to the sole of his boot and lit the short fuse of the dynamite . When the men around him lunged for him , he was alternately singing to himself and puffing ineffectually at the flaming fuse , as though it were a candle on a cake . One of the men managed to get hold of the dynamite stick and fling it away , but Steven could n't remember much beyond that , except for an earsplitting noise , pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he was now . He lifted his head from the soft pillow , which smelled pleasantly of starch and fresh air . " Hello ? Somebody ? Anybody ! " No one answered his call . Maybe this was a hotel room , instead of a house . Steven tried to roll onto his side to get a better look , but the pain was too strong . It pressed him onto his back again . He was fighting to keep from losing consciousness when the door opened and a stranger walked in . Steven would have drawn on him if he 'd had his .45 , instead , his hand slapped uselessly against his thigh . " Relax , son , " said the old man , and Steven finally noticed that he was carrying a battered doctor 's bag . " I 'm here to help you . " " Where 's my forty-five ? " Steven rasped . The doctor shrugged . " Wherever Chloe puts guns , I suppose , " he answered . He was a paunchy middle-aged man with a balding pate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You wo n't need any firearms here . What 's your name , boy ? " Steven tried to think of an alias and found that he could n't . His brain was like frozen horseshit . " Steven Fairfax , " he admitted . " And I 'm not a boy , damn it . I fought in the war , same as you probably did . " His bristly response brought a smile from the doctor , who was setting his bag on a table beside Steven 's bed . " Name 's Dr. Waverly , " he said , " but you can call me Doc . Are you in a lot of pain ? " Steven glared up at him . " Hell , no , you damned Yankee  --  I never felt better in my life ! " Doc laughed at that . " Spare me the Rebel yells , Johnny . The war 's been over for a long time . " He was filling a syringe , holding it up to the light from the window with the lace curtains . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just passing through , " Steven answered grudgingly . " And you keep that needle away from me . " The doctor smiled again . " Sorry , Reb . It just so happens that I 'm giving the orders around here . Luckily for you , I 'm on your side . " Steven 's shirt was in rags on his chest , and the doctor had an easy time finding a place on his upper arm to swab with cool alcohol . The pain would n't allow him to struggle , so he endured the puncture of the needle . " Just a little morphine , " Doc Waverly said . " We 've got to move you and wrap those ribs of yours , not to mention taking a few stitches here and there . Believe me , you 'll be happier asleep . " Steven was already being pushed into a dark corner of his mind . Resisting the stuff was no good ; it had him , dead to rights . He felt himself drifting , though , and for a while he was aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was back at Fairhaven , his father 's house outside of New Orleans , and he was a boy again . He and Maman were sitting in a carriage on the road , admiring the palatial white house in the distance . It had brick walks and sprawling green lawns , and he could see a fountain rising from the garden , spewing diamonds against a bright blue sky . " Someday you 'll live here , where you belong , " Maman said sadly , in her musical French accent . " Oui , you too will be a Fairfax  --  no longer will you call yourself Dupris . " Seated there beside his mother , Steven knew the first true hunger of his life . And it was n't the sort that could be satisfied with good Cajun cooking . It was a spiritual craving , like looking upon heaven from the borders of hell . Steven 's drugged mind spun forward from that point , carrying him to the afternoon of his father 's funeral , He stood beyond the high wrought-iron gates , watching as Beau Fairfax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man had never acknowledged him , but old Cyrus , patriarch of the dwindling Fairfax family , saw him there and approached , looking dignified in his black suit , despite the summer heat . " You 're Monique 's boy ? " he asked . By that time Steven was sixteen years old and he 'd been at St. Matthew 's School for Boys for four terms . " Yes , sir , " he answered his grandfather . " I was sorry to hear that Monique passed away of the fever . " Steven hardened his spirit against the memory . New Orleans was occupied by Union troops , his mother was gone , and nothing was as it had been before . " Thank you , sir , " he said . " I 'd like you to came back to Fairhaven with me . There 's mention of you in your daddy 's will . " Steven shook his head . " I do n't want anything from him . " " You plannin ' on slippin ' past enemy lines and joinin ' up with General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off-guard , perhaps because it was precisely what he meant to do . He hesitated between a lie and the truth , and in that moment Cyrus Fairfax discerned what he needed to know . " Do n't be a fool , Steven . Leave this fight to them that are suited to it . " Steven was not overly tall at five foot eleven , but he was solidly built and an expert at fencing . He 'd been the champion for two years running at St. Matthew 's . He shoved a hand through his longish brown hair , and his hazel eyes snapped with the French fire spawned in him by his mother 's blood . " I could beat any Yankee , " he boasted . Despite the somberness of the occasion , Cyrus had actually chuckled at that . " I reckon you think so , anyway . Tell me , since those blue-bellies have overstayed their welcome here in New Orleans , how is it that you have n't gotten rid of them before now ? " Steven felt his face fill with color . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rapiers after fencing class every day . " At this the old man had laughed outright . " Come , to Fairhaven , " he repeated when he 'd composed himself . " You 'll have all the fighting you need there . Your half-brother Macon will probably bloody your nose a time or two , but I reckon you 'll be able to hold your own once you 've developed a strategy . " He leaned a little closer to the high fence that separated them . " Macon 's the sneaky type , you know . Got to watch your back around him . " Steven was intrigued , in spite of himself , and the next day when a carriage came to St. Matthew 's to fetch him , he went without protest . Although he had himself convinced this was only a ploy to avoid his Latin lesson , he 'd become more and more curious about the man he 'd scarcely known . Sure enough , Macon had proved to be a son-of-a-bitch and a coward , never uttering a word of protest when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command posts . Steven had stayed only two months after that , and then he 'd taken the horse Cyrus had given him , along with a Yankee uniform snatched from the clothes line , and he 'd ridden out . The moment he was beyond the reach of the occupation army , he tore that uniform off as though it burned his skin and changed back into his own clothes . A week after that he became a private in General Lee 's army ... " Say , Mister ? Mister ! " Steven came back to himself , opened his eyes , and saw an aging painted face suspended above his . It was surrounded by elaborately coiffed hair of an unlikely shade of red , but it was friendly . " Lord knows , you 'd probably like a bath better than anything , " the woman said companionably , " but the doc said some food would help more , so I brought you a bowl of Daisy 's chicken and dumplings . " Steven looked somewhat wildly at the tray in her hands , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satin-clad body . The wallpaper was different here , and the bed faced in another direction . " Where the devil am I ? " he demanded , easing himself upward a little way on the pillows . Although the motion was difficult , it was no longer impossible . " My house , " the woman said . " My name 's Chloe Reese , and Doc says you 're Steven Fairfax , so you do n't need to introduce yourself . " " What a relief , " Steven remarked , with only mild sarcasm . His stomach was rumbling ; he wanted the food she offered . Chloe smiled . " No need to be nasty , now . After all , if it were n't for me and my girls , you might be lying in the back of the feed store , instead of in this comfortable bed . " He accepted the tray and began to eat , and it was only then that he noticed the wrapping around his ribs and the bandages swathing his stomach and both arms . " Hell , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could leave this town . Macon might already have tracked him here . " Where 's my gun ? " he demanded , talking with his mouth full . " You surely do n't have the manners one would expect of a southern boy , " Chloe remarked , examining her glossy fingernails . " It 's locked away downstairs . I do n't allow firearms in my place . " Steven was careful to finish chewing and swallow . He could n't say he was in danger because Chloe might figure out that he was wanted , and if anybody started going through the posters down at the marshal 's office , he could end up wearing a rope . Unfortunately he 'd already given his name to the doctor , while his defenses were down . " Well , ma'am , " he said , " the truth is , I 'm a lawman , and I 've got to keep that pistol handy . " " If you 're a lawman , " Chloe countered , " where 's your badge ? " Steven thought fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liar . " I must have lost it in the blast , " he said . Chloe did n't look convinced . " I 'm still not going to let you lie in here with a gun in your hand , Mr. Fairfax . This is a respectable house . " Steven had finished his supper , and Chloe , who had been seated beside his bed in a ladderback chair , stood to take his tray . " What time is it ? " he wanted to know . The darkness at the windows could have been that of twilight or of early dawn . " Six-thirty in the evening , " Chloe answered shortly . She nodded toward another chair , where what remained of Steven 's long canvas coat was draped . " What we found on and around you we put in the pocket of that coat . And there was n't any badge . " With that , she crossed the room and walked out , closing the door behind her . Steven lay back in the flickering light of the kerosene lantern burning on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him alone in a room with pansies on the walls , unable to defend himself . Fulton laid a heavy hand on Emma 's knee , there in the larger of Chloe 's two parlors , and Emma quickly set it away . " God 's eyeballs , Emma , " Fulton complained in a sort of whiny whisper , " we 're practically engaged ! " " It 's not proper to talk about God 's anatomy , " Emma said stiffly , squinting at the needlework in the stand in front of her before plunging the needle in . " And if you do n't keep your hands to yourself , you 'll just have to go home . " Fulton gave an exaggerated sigh . " You 'd think a girl would learn something , living in the same house with Chloe Reese . " Emma 's dark blue eyes were wide with annoyance when she turned them on Fulton . " I beg your pardon ? " " Well , I only meant  --  " " I know what you meant , Fulton . " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he 's willing to promise the rest of his life to a woman ! " Emma narrowed her eyes , planning to point out that he was n't the only one with a lifetime on the line , but before she could speak , Fulton grabbed her and pressed his dry mouth to hers . She squirmed , wondering why on earth those romantic English novels spoke of kissing as though it were something wonderful , and when she could n't get free , she poked Fulton in the hand with her embroidery needle . He gave a shout and jerked back , slapping at his hand as though a bug had lighted there . " Damn it all to perdition ! " he barked . Emma calmly rethreaded her needle and went back to embroidering her nosegay . It was a lovely thing of pink , lavender , and white flowers , frothed in baby 's breath . It was never good to let a man get too familiar . " Good night , Fulton , " she said . Stiffly , Fulton stood . " Wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gate ? " he grumbled . Thinking of the respectability that would be hers if she were to marry Fulton someday , Emma suppressed a sigh , secured her needle in the tightly drawn cloth , and rose to her feet . Her arm linked with his , she walked him to the gate . The night was speckled with stars and scented with the fragrance of the nearby lake , and Emma had a romantic turn of heart . She stood on tiptoe and kissed Fulton 's cheek . He looked very pleased . She touched his wounded hand in apology . " I 'm sorry I stuck you with my needle , " she said . Fulton caught her hand in his and lifted it to his mouth . He kissed her knuckles lightly , and the tickling sensation made her shiver , though she felt none of the delicious things novels promised . His words were anything but poetic . " A man has certain needs , Emma , " he said , after clearing his throat loudly . " I do hope you wo n't turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Emma favored him with a sweet smile , but her voice was firm when she said again , " Good night . " She saw no need to remind him that a formal agreement had yet to be made . Reluctantly , Fulton left , opening the gate and disappearing down the street . Emma hurried back into the house , searching for Chloe . She found her adoptive mother in the small parlor , listening to the delicate strains of a music box , a dreamy expression on her artfully embellished face . When Chloe saw Emma , she closed the inlaid ivory lid of the music box and smiled . " Hello , darling . Did Fulton leave ? " " Yes , " Emma answered , smoothing her skirts before she sat in the chair opposite Chloe 's . " Good . I ca n't think what you see in that lumbering baboon . " Emma was used to Chloe 's blunt opinions , and she was unruffled . Indeed , there were times when she herself thought Fulton rather awkward . " He 's a gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd had to spear the man with an embroidery needle to make him remove his hands from her person . " Tell me about the saloon explosion . I 've been waiting all afternoon to hear what happened . " Chloe sighed wearily . " Old Freddy Fiddengate was celebrating his birthday . He made a wish and blew on a dynamite fuse , but , the flame did n't go out . " Emma 's eyes were wide , and one hand was pressed to her mouth . " Was anyone killed ? " " No , but we 've got a fellow upstairs that 's hurt pretty bad . Doc says he has cracked ribs , and he was cut up by broken glass . " Emma shuddered , imagining some poor derelict lying upstairs in one of Chloe 's guest rooms , suffering . Chloe went on with her account . " Charlie Simmons has a broken leg  --  he was standing at the bar , as usual , swilling that rotgut whiskey they sell over there  --  and Philo DeAngelo lost two toes . Everybody else just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chloe 's hand , Emma spoke softly . " You 're exhausted . Why do n't you go to bed , and I 'll make you some hot milk . " Chloe made a face . " You know I ca n't stand that stuff . And besides , I 've got to go back over to the Stardust and make sure things are all right . I have my girls to think about , you know . " Emma knew from long experience that there would be no talking Chloe into staying home if she wanted to go out . " Very well , then , go ahead , " ' she said . " I 'll drink the hot milk myself . " Rising from her chair , Chloe shook her head as though in amazement . " You 're dull as a toothless old woman , Emma , " she said . " You should be out there in the moonlight , letting some handsome young man kiss you and hold your hand . And I 'm not talking about that stuffy banker , either . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out primly , already on her way to the staircase . " That 's part of the problem , " Chloe fussed . " Personally , I think you 're just trying to show the world you are n't like me . " Emma paused midway up the stairs . Despite the fact that she managed a thriving brothel , there probably was n't a kinder soul than Chloe in the whole of the territory . " I do n't care what people think , " she replied , but she knew that was a lie and so did Chloe .
