<p> IT 'S a cold day in Boston , and the snow is being blown all around by the frigid wind , but it 's warm inside the Mercedes , and Carl T. Rowan settles in the rear seat for a rolling interview on the way from one radio program to another . <p> This is Mr. Rowan 's book tour , the grueling , nationwide round of interviews that authors must endure , repeating the same **26;235;TOOLONG anecdote , the same offhand but incisive political observation , the same pleasant chatter . <p> Rowan is promoting his memoir , called " Breaking Barriers , " and he is cheerful despite his task because he anticipates making an early flight to Detroit , the fruit of a smooth-running schedule . His beige ultrasuede jacket is crease-free , his blue trousers are crisp - but after all , Rowan is accustomed to both book tours and broadcasting his message . This book is his sixth , and each week he produces five radio commentaries and appears on a television political talkshow . That 's on top of his thrice-weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how he digests the media , describing his daily , crack-of-dawn intake of seven newspapers ( The Washington Post , The New York Times , The Washington Times , The Baltimore Sun , The New York Post , The Wall Street Journal , and The Chicago Sun-Times ) . That day 's Washington Post has a long profile of Rowan that contains the same list , but adds USA Today . Either way , he reads a lot of newspapers , and then watches the morning news shows . <p> " Often that generates the idea or the emotion to say , ' You got to write about this subject ... ' Other times it may be that I 've had lunch or dinner with someone the night before , and out of those conversations I get ideas for doing columns . " <p> Even a book tour can lead to column fodder . Rowan later writes of his New England sojourn : " BOSTON - I sit here on a television show talking about a possible war against Iraq or the impact of a current recession , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to worry most about America , 1991 . " <p> " I spend hours , " the column continues , " agonizing over the fact that our big cities , and even our small towns , have become killing fields where young men especially are racking up record numbers of homicides . " <p> Ask Carl Rowan how he defines his role in the marketplace of punditry and he will say : " A voice of the oppressed and of the poor , the voice for a new level of justice , a new measure of justice . " But he knows that he 's seen as a relic of a more liberal but discredited time , and that sense comes across in this same column , and not without bitterness . " Fools who talk about ' the fading liberal establishment ' are so obtuse as to reject the wisdom of ( Hubert ) Humphrey about how to turn a 16-year-old possible burglar or drug-peddling murderer into an honored part of the American ' establishment . ' <p> " If only we had a Hubert Humphrey in power now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive to accusations of being discredited . In 1988 he shot and injured a trespassing skinny-dipper who had taken a nocturnal swim in the pool at Rowan 's home , and his critics howled hypocrisy : Rowan the liberal columnist stridently calls for gun control , but Rowan the homeowner defends his life and property with an unregistered handgun . <p> " Breaking Barriers " opens with this scene , and a closing chapter rounds out his account of how he acted out of a genuine fear caused by the trespasser 's attempt to enter his house . The gun , he writes , was an " exempt-from-registration " pistol kept at the house by Rowan 's son , a former FBI agent . He is indignant about the legacy of the event : " I know that if I died tomorrow , for much of the media my accomplishments would not mean as much as the fact that I was tried for allegedly shooting a ' skinny-dipper ' with an ' unregistered ' gun . " <p> He is justifiably proud of those accomplishments : He was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time when there were hardly any black journalists at mainstream publications , President Kennedy 's US ambassador to Finland , and director of the US Information Agency under President Johnson . <p> Writing for newspapers in Minneapolis in the early 1950s , Rowan provided penetrating coverage of race relations in the South , concentrating on the quotidian humilities enforced by Jim Crow segregation laws . The stories were widely reprinted , and later published in book form . <p> " Millions of Americans could not comprehend the details that I was giving them , " he says now . " Going into Birmingham and seeing the Imperial Laundry and seeing a big sign on top of the building : ' We Wash White Folks ' Clothes Only . " ' <p> " Heh , heh , " he chuckles , gearing up for the punch line . " I asked the black woman in there why she 'd work for a joint like that , and she said , ' Well the joke 's on them , Mister . They do wash some colored folks ' clothes , ' cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughs a little more at this anecdote . <p> After other journalistic successes , Rowan served Kennedy and Johnson , and in 1965 took up the mantle of a syndicated columnist . Since then he has n't provided the gripping reportage that marked his earlier work in the media , but he values the columnist 's impact . <p> " I would say that the column has more impact day-to-day than any reporting could have , because you got people from the White House and all the departments who are looking to see what 's being said in the columns , particularly if you are taking an aggressive stance . " <p> Later he adds : " I never go to a cocktail party in Washington that I do n't run into something I needed to know . And some official may ( say ) ... ' Well let me tell you something , there 's some hanky-panky going on on this issue , and you ought to know what the facts are . And these are The Facts . " ' <p> ROWAN concedes that his most popular columns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " off the news , " observations on the culture or even on his own life . He says his all-time most popular piece was on the corn-row hair style , a feat of braiding that hit fad status with Bo Derek 's appearance in the movie " 10 . " <p> " I wrote a column saying , ' Hair ai n't where it 's at - it does n't matter how you style your hair if there 's nothing under it , " ' Rowan recalls . " Oh boy , did I get the mail . " <p> Then there was his appliance column . " There was a little toaster given my wife and me as a wedding gift , and I was sitting there the night before my ... 27th anniversary , and thinking about what I was going to write about , " he says . <p> " And I looked over and spotted this toaster and realized it was one of the few appliances or anything that we still had working , and I wrote about , " his voice drops and slows : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
