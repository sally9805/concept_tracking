Section : CAR TRENDS 2000 What you do n't know about your car 's defects could be costing you thousands <p> Mark and Debbie Arnosky of Pottstown , Pa. , were driving home from a shopping trip during rush hour earlier this year when their Dodge Grand Caravan let out a big bang and slowed to a crawl . Oh no , Mark Arnosky remembers thinking , not the transmission ! <p> They had the minivan towed to a dealer and prepared for the worst . The 1990 Caravan had 113,000 miles and was well out of warranty . " They have you over a barrel , essentially , " Arnosky says . " You need the vehicle . You ca n't afford to buy another one . Therefore , you pay the $1,800 . " <p> First , though , Arnosky , who had already replaced the transmission once , did a little digging . A web search revealed that the Caravan 's transmission woes were widespread and that Chrysler knew about them . The next day , Arnosky took that information to the dealer and ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge . " It certainly gave me the confidence to go in there , " he says of his research . If I did not know there was a long history of transmission problems with this vehicle , then they may have been able to persuade me into just paying for the entire repair . " <p> Whether you plan to keep your current vehicle or are in the market for a new one , the Arnoskys ' experience is enlightening . <p> Most people have heard of car recalls , which stem from potentially serious safety problems that manufacturers are required to notify owners about and fix at no cost . But consumers are generally unaware of a far longer list of vehicle problems that have been deemed widespread but not hazardous . <p> The problems - from peeling paint to faulty head gaskets to engine surges - cover vehicles of all makes , models , and years . Manufacturers notified the government of some 11,000 of these defects last year alone ( compared with 245 recalls ) . <p> But federal law does n't require you be notified - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or when manufacturers have " adjusted " the warranty , informing dealers they 'll fix the problem free . Few states are watching out for consumers on this issue - which means that many people end up paying for these repairs out of pocket or simply living with the problems , never knowing they stem from factory defects and could be fixed for little or nothing . <p> This report details how to find information about your vehicle and how best to approach dealers and manufacturers to have defects fixed . In " Is there a hidden warranty on your car ? " we list some of the more widespread warranty adjustments available to cars owners . Got a problem ? <p> When a car manufacturer determines that problems like leaks , vibrating steering columns , or components wearing out too soon may be widespread for a particular model , it sends a report to its dealers on each such defect , with diagnostic and repair information . By law , manufacturers are required to file these technical service bulletins with the federal National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's files , for example , 44 bulletins have been reported for the 1996 Chevrolet Cavalier , 15 bulletins for the 1996 Toyota Camry , and 239 for the 1996 Ford Taurus . Of course , those problems wo n't show up in every car of a particular model . And sometimes the bulletins clearly state that the manufacturer will fix the problem at no cost - even after the warranty has expired . That may also be true even if the bulletin does n't specifically say so . <p> In many cases , though , it 's in the dealers ' and manufacturers ' interest to keep these so-called goodwill efforts or warranty adjustments from being widely publicized . They prefer negotiating on a case-by-case basis , hoping either to avoid the full cost of their mistakes or to turn the owners into grateful - and loyal - customers . Your rights <p> Major car components such as the transmission , and major possible problem areas such as the head gasket and camshaft , should last for at least ten years or 100,000 miles . If major premature failure occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer free fixes or at least help pay for repairs . <p> But when such failures do occur , the realities of today 's marketplace make it especially tough going for consumers trying to remedy defects . <p> Two years ago , for example , Ford reportedly told its dealers that it would be offering fewer warranty adjustments for vehicles with more than 50,000 miles . " Research shows that we get the biggest bang for our buck between 36,000 and 50,000 miles of ownership , " according to a report Ford distributed to its dealers . The best customers - the ones manufacturers try most to keep happy - are those who buy new vehicles by the time their old one hits 50,000 miles . <p> To keep costs down , carmakers - who compensate their dealers for in-warranty repairs - have also increased their scrutiny of dealer warranty work , some dealers say . When a manufacturer finds what it considers a high volume of repairs by one dealer , it can make the dealer foot the bill for some of those repairs and step up its auditing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' warranty service , according to Jack Steinkamp , spokesman for the Ford Parts Managers Association , which represents delears . A dealer who might once have sided with the customer in judging whether a repair was covered by a warranty , Steinkamp says , might now be reluctant to do so for fear of increasing his chances of being audited . <p> " Most manufacturers have been compelled to make an assault on ' Warranty Waste , ' " according to the web site of Wizards of Warranty , a newsletter for car dealers . <p> Ford has not increased dealer audits in ten years , says company spokesman Mike Vaughn , who adds , " At no time have we pressured dealers to cut back on contractual warranty work . " <p> State and federal lemon laws give new-car owners the right to a refund or a replacement vehicle if a dealer is repeatedly unable to repair a major defect that occurs within a year or two of the sale . Protection evaporates when the regular warranty expires . <p> Four states - California , Connecticut , Virginia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing laws requiring carmakers to formally notify consumers affected by warranty-adjustment programs . But there 's little state follow-up , and consumers are generally unaware of these laws , state officials concede . <p> California 's five-year-old law also requires dealers to post signs in showrooms mentioning the existence of technical service bulletins - but not to provide the bulletins themselves . Of California 's nearly 18 million registered car owners , just three people requested more information about the law , the state 's Motor Vehicle Board says . Not a single consumer has contacted the board with a complaint about warranty-adjustment programs - a sign , officials say , that consumers do n't know where to turn for help . Officials for Virginia and Wisconsin say few consumers have contacted them , either . <p> In Connecticut , " The existing laws simply have n't worked , " says Richard Blumenthal , the state attorney general . His office has proposed legislation , strongly opposed by industry , to close a loophole that lets a carmaker avoid having to disclose to a car owners even widely applied goodwill adjustments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis . <p> transmission woes . When their transmission died , Mark and Debbie Arnosky expected a big bill . Then Mark searched the web and discovered that the problem was widespread and that Chrysler knew about it . They got a new transmission - and paid only for labor <p> Texas 's motor-vehicle code requires carmakers to file all warranty agreements with the state , but the code is unclear about warranty-adjustment programs . When we requested a copy of a Ford adjustment program we knew existed , it was n't on file . If enough Texas consumers complained to the Motor Vehicle Division about the lack of information on warranty-adjustment policies , says L. David Brunke , the division 's director of consumer affairs , the state 's Motor Vehicle Board could clarify the law and possibly require manufacturers to file all warranty adjustments . How not to pay for defects <p> Consumers like the Arnoskys show that you can get vehicles with defective parts fixed free or at a reduced price . Servicing a car regularly at an authorized dealer works in your favor for loyalty points , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealer if the prices and service are much better elsewhere . Here are other things to do : <p> For vehicles under warranty : This is the best time to discover a defect , so plan ahead . If you 're nearing the end of a warranty , ask your dealer if there are any warranty or goodwill adjustments in effect for your car . <p> On your own , find your model 's technical service bulletins , consumer complaints , and defect investigations on NHTSA 's web site ( **31;169;TOOLONG ) and print out all lists for reference . Check the other free resources listed below . ( If you do n't have Internet access at home , try your local library . ) Show proof of any applicable problems to your dealer 's service department while your warranty is still in effect . Have the dealer check out those parts covered by technical service bulletins to see if any are about to fail . Keep copies of all written communications and notes on all conversations . <p> For vehicles out of warranty : Now your hand is weaker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear and tear . Peeling paint , transmission failures , and other major problems have all been traced to factory defects . If you 're not certain about a problem 's cause , check the resources listed below before you bring in the car for repairs . <p> At the dealership , first have the service department give you a written estimate so they ca n't give you an inflated " regular " charge and then offer you a bogus discount . After getting the estimate , ask if there are any warranty-adjustment policies in effect for your model . <p> If none apply but there is documentation about a factory defect that appears to cover your problem , present the information you 've collected and ask for a goodwill adjustment . Your documentation should show that the problem is widespread and that the manufacturer knows about it . If the service adviser refuses , work your way up the line from service manager to the dealership 's management . If necessary , call the manufacturer 's customer-assistance hotline . <p> If the defect is costly enough , it may pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haugaard , a bill collector from Puyallup , Wash. , called Ford 's customer-assistance number several years ago after two-inch patches of paint began peeling off the roof of his 1988 Ford Ranger . " They knew it was a problem , " because Ford had issued a technical service bulletin about it , Haugaard says . But he adds that in his case , they would n't do anything about it . Ford spokesman Vaughn says that Haugaard 's car was n't eligible for the repairs because its warranty had already expired . <p> peeling paint . Ford Motor Co. said it could n't help Kirk Haugaard with his car 's peeling paint . But that did n't stop him . After finding widespread evidence of the problem , Haugaard sued Ford in small-claims court - and won . <p> Haugaard waited several years before curiosity drove him to the Internet , where he found press accounts and documentation of wide-spread paint problems in models that included his car , including a related Ford technical service bulletin from 1991 . <p> Haugaard ended up suing Ford in small-claims court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked for easy reading by the judge , and over Ford 's argument that his car 's mileage was excessive , Haugaard won $1,750 plus filing fees . " Nobody does anything about it because they think it 's going to be too big of a deal , " he says of other car owners . He urges others in similar situations not to give up . <p> For all vehicles : If you 're willing to dig , there are now more ways than ever to discover defects your car model may have and what help the manufacturer may provide : NHTSA ( 800 445-0197 ; ( **31;202;TOOLONG ) .

They can be useful for getting a preliminary estimate and gathering information about defects . Frank Zabaly , a software engineer from Dallas , recently took his 1996 Acura Integra to an independent shop after the Acura dealer twice failed to explain why fluid was leaking from the antilock brake system . The car was nearing the end of its warranty . They did n't want to hear any details , " Zabaly says of the dealer . On his own , Zabaly had unsuccessfully searched for technical service bulletins on the problem . Then the independent mechanic told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for the 1996 Honda Accord . Further , the mechanic believed the two cars used similar parts . Zabaly obtained the Accord 's service bulletin and gave it to the dealer 's technician ; with a little prodding , the technician replaced the brake system 's modulator under the Integra 's warranty . Best of all , Zabaly had no more leaking fluid . 1Extended warranties In our judgment , extended warranties are n't worth the money , especially if you buy a reliable car - one whose predicted reliability we rate excellent or very good - or plan on keeping the car only three or four years .
