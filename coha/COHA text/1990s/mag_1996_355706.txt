From the moment he was arrested for the murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas three years ago , Richard Allen Davis has seemed determined to become a poster boy for evil . Swaggering , unrepentant , Davis smiled often during his trial as details of the kidnapping and killing brought tears to many in the San Jose , California , courtroom . Last week , at the sentencing hearing that followed his conviction in June , Davis reached a startling new low when , moments before being sentenced to death , he accused Polly 's father of molesting the girl . <P> A gasp was heard in the courtroom as Davis asserted that the reason he did not sexually assault Polly on the night he killed her was " a statement the young girl made to me while walking her up the embankment : ' Just do n't do me like my Dad . ' " A family friend yelled , " Burn in hell , Davis ! " and Davis ' lawyer covered her face with her hands . After a second of frozen shock , Polly 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was restrained and led from the courtroom . <P> As outrageous as the charge was ( prosecutors say there is no evidence of any parental abuse ) , it was not a wild , Manson-like outburst . A career criminal who has been in and out of jail since he was a teenager , Davis knows that child molesters are not popular in prison , and he has been eager to deny that he raped Polly before strangling her . But his defiant statement made it " very easy " to pronounce the death sentence , Judge Thomas C. Hastings said . And Marc Klaas vowed to get the ultimate satisfaction . " The last thing Polly saw before she died was Richard Allen Davis ' eyes , " he said . " The last thing Richard Allen Davis will see is my eyes , I hope .
