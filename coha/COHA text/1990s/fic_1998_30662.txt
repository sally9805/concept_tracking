A lWe were twins , but Cary liked to call himself my older brother because , according to Papa , he was born two minutes and twenty-nine seconds before me . He behaved like an older brother from the moment he could crawl and protect me . He cried when I was unhappy and he laughed when he heard me laugh , even if he did n't know why I was laughing . When I asked him about that once , he said the sound of my laughter was music to him and it pleased him so much , he could n't help but smile and then laugh , too . It was as if we were enchanted children who heard our own songs , melodies that were sung to us by the sea we loved so much . As far back as I can remember , there was always magic in the water . Cary could wade in and come walking out with the most spectacular seaweed , starfish , clamshells , seashells , and even things he claimed had washed across the ocean from other countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believed anything he said . Sometimes I thought Cary must have been born with seawater in his veins . No one loved it as much , even when it was nasty and wild . What discoveries Daddy let us keep , we kept in either Cary 's room or mine . We decided everything had some sort of power to it , whether it was the power to grant us a wish or the power to make us healthier or happier just by touching it . We assigned an enchanted quality to each thing we found . When I was twelve and I wore a necklace made from the tiny seashells we had found , my friends at school were amazed at the way I identified each and every shell , explaining how this one could drive away sadness or that one could make the dark clouds move on . They laughed and shook their heads and said Cary and I were simply foolish and even immature . It was time we grew up and put away childish ideas . There was no magic in these things for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sand . Cary and I once sat beside each other and let the sand fall through our fingers , pretending each grain was a tiny world unto itself . Inside it lived people like us , too tiny to ever be seen , even with a strong microscope . " Be careful where you step , " we told our friends when they were with us on the beach . " You might crush a whole country . " They grimaced with confusion , shook their heads , and walked on , leaving us behind , enveloped by our own imaginative pictures , pictures no one else wanted to share . We were inseparable for so long , I guess people thought we had been born attached . Some of my jealous girlfriends once made up a story about me , claiming I had a long scar down the side of my body from my underarm to my waist and Cary had the same scar on his body . It was where we supposedly had been connected at birth . Sometimes , I thought , maybe it 's true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separating had begun , a slow and painful process . It was a separation Cary fought much harder than I did as we grew older . As a very young girl and even when I first entered my junior high school years , I was comfortable , happy and grateful for Cary 's devotion to me . Other brothers and sisters I knew argued and occasionally insulted each other , often in public ! Cary never said a really bad thing to me , and if he spoke to me in a manner that suggested he was impatient or annoyed with me , he immediately regretted it afterward . I knew that other girls fixed their flirtatious gazes at Cary and competed with each other for his attention . It was n't just a sister 's prejudice for me to say Cary was handsome . From the first day he could cast a rope or carry a pail , he accompanied Daddy on the lobster boat and helped in the cranberry bog . He always had a dark tan that brought out the emeralds in his green eyes , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strands lying softly over the right side of his forehead , just above his eyebrow . It looked so much like silk , girls were jealous and all of them longed to run their fingers through it . My brother carried himself firmly with the demeanor of a confident little man , even when he was just in grade school . Other boys used to make fun of the way he held up his head and shoulders , striding alongside me with his gaze firmly fixed on where we were headed , his lips tight . Soon , however , they started to envy him , and girls in our classes just naturally thought of him as older , more mature . Frustrated by their failure to win his attention and interest , however , they eventually found comfort in making fun of us . By the time we were in high school , they were calling Cary " Grandpa . " He did n't seem to care or even notice . I was sure it bothered me more than it bothered him , and it was n't unless someone physically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that Cary reacted , almost always violently . It did n't matter if the other boy was bigger or even if there were more than one . Cary 's temper was as quick and as devastating as a hurricane . His eyes became glassy and his lips were stretched so tightly they formed white spots in the corners . Anyone who challenged him directly knew they were in for a fight . Of course , Cary would get into trouble , no matter how justified his reaction was . It was he who had lost his temper and usually he who dealt the most damage to his opponents . Almost every time he was suspended from school , Daddy gave him a beating and confined him to his room , but nothing Daddy could do and no punishment the school could impose would deter him if he believed my honor was somehow compromised . With such a devoted and loyal protector watching over me , other boys kept their distance . It was n't until I entered high school that I realized how untouchable I had become in their eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had boyfriends , but no boy dared pass me a note in class , and none joined me in the hallways to walk from one class to another , much less walk me home . I walked with some girlfriends or with Cary , and if I walked with girls , Cary usually followed behind us like my guard dog . When I reached sophomore year , however , I , like most of my girlfriends , wanted a boy who showed serious interest in me . There was a boy named Stephen Daniels who had lived in Provincetown only a year , who I thought was very handsome . I wanted him to talk to me , to walk with me , and even ask me to go on a date . I thought he wanted to because he was always looking at me , but he never did . All my girlfriends at the time told me he wanted to , but said he would n't because of my brother . Stephen was afraid of Cary . I mentioned it to Cary and he said Stephen Daniels was stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him what he wanted . He said he knew that from listening to him in the boys ' locker room . Later , I found out Cary had actually walked up to him and put his face an inch from Stephen 's , threatening to break his neck if he should so much as look twice at me . Naturally , I was disappointed , but I could n't help wondering if Cary had been right . In the evenings after we had done our homework and helped Mommy with May , our younger sister who had been born deaf and was attending a special school for the handicapped , Cary and I would talk about some of the other kids at school . No matter what girlfriend of mine I mentioned to him , he found fault with her . The only girl he did n't criticize was Theresa Patterson , Roy Patterson 's oldest child . Theresa 's father , Roy , worked with Daddy on the lobster boat . The Pattersons were Bravas , half African-American , half Portuguese . The other students looked down their noses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-blooded families , families who were able to trace their lineage back to the Pilgrims , families like Grandma Olivia 's , Daddy 's mother , who ruled over us like a dowager queen . Cary liked Theresa and enjoyed being friends with her because he liked the way she and her Brava friends defied the other students . When I asked him if he could ever think of Theresa as a girlfriend , he raised his eyebrows as if I had said the silliest thing and replied , " Do n't be stupid , Laura . Theresa 's like another sister to me . " I suppose she was , but as I grew older and felt Cary 's shadow over my shoulder more and more , I began to wish he found some other girl to win his attention . I did my best to recommend this one or that , but nothing I said made him act any differently toward them . If anything , when I mentioned a possible girlfriend for him , that girl suddenly became ugly or stupid in his eyes . I realized it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . Only , nature did n't . I used to think nature just missed Cary . She walked by one day while he was out on the lobster boat or something . Other boys his age were trying to get dates , hanging out in town , showing off to get a girl 's attention , asking girls to do things with them ; but Cary ... Cary spent all his free time with me or his model boats upstairs in his attic workshop , a room just above mine . Finally , one day at lunch I mentioned my growing concern to Theresa . She rolled her dark eyes and looked at me as if I had just been hatched . " Do n't you hear all the talk behind your back ? All the whispering and gossip ? There is n't a girl in this school who thinks Cary 's normal , Laura ; and most of the boys have their doubts about you . They do n't talk to me about it , but I hear what they say . " " What do you mean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked , trembling in anticipation . " They 're saying you and your brother are like boyfriend and girlfriend , Laura , " she replied hesitantly . My heart skipped a beat and I remember looking around the cafeteria that day and thinking everyone was looking at us , their eyes full of contempt . I shook my head , the deeper realizations taking shape like some dark , ugly beast who had crawled out of a nightmare into my daytime thoughts . " Look at you , " Theresa continued . " You 're fifteen now and one of the prettiest girls in this school , but do you have a boyfriend ? No . Anyone asking you to the school dances ? No . If you go , you go with Cary . " " But " " There are no buts , Laura . It 's because of Cary , " she said . " Because of the way he dotes on you . I 'm sorry , " she added . " I really thought you knew and did n't care . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She nudged me with her shoulder like she usually did when she was going to say something nasty about one of the other girls in school . " Get him a girlfriend who 'll stir up his hormones and you 'll be fine , " she said . I remember she got up to join her Brava friends and I sat there , suddenly feeling very alone and unhappy . Cary came walking into the cafeteria quickly , spotted me , and marched over . " Sorry I 'm late , " he said . " Mr. Corkren kept me after class about my homework again . What 's going on ? " He looked closely at me when I did n't respond . " Did something happen ? " I just shook my head . I wondered how I could tell him and not hurt him . I put it off and never really tried to make him understand until the year after , when Robert Royce and his family bought the old Sea Marina Hotel and Robert entered school . For me and Robert , it was love at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of magic Cary could n't share . Somehow I had to make him understand and accept . I had to show him how to separate himself from me . I only hoped it was possible .
