I had to ask someone how to find the criminal court building , so apparently I 'd led a sheltered life . A woman directed me to Franklin Street and said I could n't miss it . I walked east toward the hulking gray walls which dead-end that part of the city . It was the cold Monday after New Year 's . No one had shoveled the snow or put any salt on the ice . <p> I 'd spent the entire holiday alone . For ten years , as long as I 'd been seeing Michael , that was the way it was . All weekend , I 'd stayed in the apartment . When the year changed its digit , some drunken boys shouted in the street , and one driver beeped his horn . Then all the sounds were the usual . <p> Frankly , I felt glad I 'd been called to jury duty . A number of times , I 'd managed to evade it , but I 'd used up my last deferral . At the moment I could think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complain about the awful inconvenience whenever I talked to other people . Being a juror seemed a blameless way of using up the next two weeks . After that I would have to look around for something else . <p> In smaller cities I 've seen courthouses that look Jeffersonian , white columns that make you think of justice . The criminal court building was Deco , but not my favorite kind that reminded me of the World 's Fair . This kind of Deco I 'd call penitential , with its heavy straight lines and its narrow windows that look barred from a distance and its base of filthy brown marble and its entrance that is somehow like a giant latrine . Still , as I 've said , I did n't mind having to go there . It was like travel to a foreign country . There was even a border crossing before they let you on the elevators , where they combed through your bag and checked your body for concealed metal . You rode up to your floor surrounded by muggers or drug dealers , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd hoped to get on a jury right away , but there were three days of waiting . I was n't prepared to wait so long . The emptiness threatened the feeling I had of being temporarily becalmed for reasons that had nothing to do with my own choices or acts . The room where they made everyone sit was enormous and overheated and had about three hundred blue plastic chairs . The name of each person present went into a brown metal drum . There were long periods of absolute tedium , then the drum was spun around , and the clerk started reading off names . He was a man with white hair and a cop face , and when he called your name over the loudspeaker , you had to rise immediately from your seat , take everything you owned , and walk into a smaller room to await instructions about your destination . It was all determined by chance  --  both where you would end up that day and the fate , perhaps , of a defendant . The clerk said no one was to take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't selected as a juror . Yet each day as the room would empty more and more and those on each side of me would rise and go , I could n't help feeling I had been overlooked or passed over for reasons I could n't understand . It was as if even here the old pattern of coming very close and being deflected was operating . <p> I was trying not to think of the Michael situation , so I struck up a conversation with the young blond woman next to me . She was a nervous wreck because she had just left her husband . She had an eight-month-old son and feared she might get sequestered . Every now and then she 'd pull photos of the baby out of her bag . " Did I show you these ? " she 'd ask . On our second day of jury duty , we went out for a Vietnamese lunch in Chinatown ; when we came back , the clerk called her name , and I never ran into her after that . <p> When you think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what often comes to mind is the last time you saw them ; you go over all the details in amazement , each one sharp , drawing a little blood . What amazes you is that there will be no next time . I see myself walking down Michael 's block quite astonished that I 'm actually doing so , yet moving forward nonetheless . And the ironically festive setting , the wreaths and the lights in the windows of the brownstones . I feel quite light myself , almost disembodied . I float right past his house since it is n't at all familiar to me . I just know the number , the fact that he lives on the second floor . I walk back two houses and see a dim yellow glow behind the second-story shutters . I almost do n't press the buzzer . When I do , one of his children answers , and I say who I am , thinking that now none of this can be undone . No one buzzes back . Instead Michael comes down the stairs and flings open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never shown me , even in the worst of times . " What are you doing ? " He can hardly get the words out . <p> " Henshaw ! " <p> It was the third morning . The sound of my name over the loudspeaker brought me up short . This time I would n't get to complete the scene , analyze the look , wonder if I was mistaken . I scrambled for my coat , my newspaper , my handbag , and stumbled gratefully toward my assignment . I soon found myself in a corridor on the thirteenth floor . <p> There were no benches in any corridor of the criminal court building , and none of the drinking fountains worked , and the judges were never ready to receive the prospective jurors . I learned all this from an indignant elderly man who offered me a piece of hard candy as we leaned against a wall outside the courtroom . Many of our group had sat down on the brown marble floor , not even caring about the dirt . Our crowd of weary jurors soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this treatment , the lack of the most basic amenities , was a disgrace . The man with the bag of hard candy was convinced that all the original benches had been removed so that the real homeless would not invade this building in search of places to sleep . <p> When the door to the courtroom finally opened , we filed in and collapsed into all the seats on the left side . I had a good view of the defendant  --  a young , husky , light-skinned man with a thin mustache curving unpleasantly down over his mouth . Behind him sat a red-haired woman , her chair pulled up very close to his . He 'd lean his head back , his eyes slightly closed , and she 'd whisper into his ear , her lips almost grazing the side of his cheek . At first I wondered if she was his lover , and if she , too , would be on trial . But it turned out she was only his interpreter . The defendant , Luis Benitez , who had shot his common-law wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't understand a word of English . His lawyer was making the plea that Luis Benitez had been suffering from extreme emotional disturbance at the time and was therefore not guilty of first-degree murder . In an old French movie , it would have been a crime passionel . <p> The judge asked if there were any of us who for personal reasons felt we could not Serve on a jury for this trial . There was practically a stampede of people asking to approach the bar ; most got sent away with satisfied looks on their faces . Very few wanted to deal with a killing . Personally , I did n't feel fazed by the idea . To tell the truth , I very much wanted to get on this case , to occupy my thoughts with Luis Benitez and Ysidra Delgado . With each person who left the courtroom carrying their coat , my chances improved . When the brown drum was spun around for the last time , I had a prickly feeling that my name would definitely be one of those it yielded up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury box and took one of the fourteen seats . <p> The judge and the lawyers wanted to know about each of us and whether we had ever been crime victims . I said I was divorced , no children , a freelance graphic artist , that I had lived for the past fifteen years on the Upper West Side , and once had my purse stolen on the IRT . When the judge asked had I ever experienced domestic violence , I recalled something I had almost forgotten  --  a ludicrous scene at the end of my marriage when I hurled a wooden bowl full of onions at my husband and missed . " No , I have n't , Your Honor , " I answered , also thinking of the last time I saw Michael , though not a blow had been struck by either of us and we 'd never shared much domesticity , apart from the Chinese takeout we 'd sometimes ordered in . There was only that look of his that I could n't mistake  --  Michael always sticks his tongue in his cheek when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange of words before he backed away and shut the door : <p> " What are you doing ? " <p> " Walking around . " And I shoved the shiny shopping bag into his hands . " Merry Christmas ! " I more or less assaulted him with the mini cappuccino maker and a little card on which I 'd written , " Only connect ! " I would still like to know whether it ended up in the garbage . <p> I was curious about why I was not selected to be a regular juror for the Luis Benitez trial , but merely one of the alternates . Was it the defense who distrusted me , or the prosecution ? Was it the wrong inflection in my voice  --  " No , I have n't , Your Honor "  --  or was it just plain mathematics ? <p> The judge said some diplomatic words about jurors who came down with the flu and alternates being absolutely essential to the whole process . It reminded me of the way a married man will string you along by his need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will change eventually . <p> " Lucky you " said one of the regular jurors afterwards as we rode down in the elevator . " At least you wo n't get sequestered out in Queens with the rest of us . They wo n't put us up at the Plaza , that 's for sure . " <p> On the first day of the trial , the prosecutor opened a carton containing the outfit Ysidra Delgado was wearing the day Luis Benitez shot her . It was a two-piece black-and-white-checked suit , over which she 'd worn a nylon ski jacket , pale pink with an ugly cream yoke . He took each separate piece out to show to the first witness , giving it a little salesman-like shake so that it would fall properly . The suit looked child-size , so Ysidra must have been a thin , tiny person , there were gold buttons down the front of the jacket and red braid sewn around the pockets , but the beige fabric was ugly and cheap . I realized after staring at it that it was a knockoff of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Easter , and now here it was , all torn apart the way the EMS people had cut it off her body , except someone must have laundered it because there was n't a trace of blood . <p> The witness gasped and looked tearful . " Yes , that 's Ysidra 's , ' she murmured . <p> I noticed Luis Benitez leaning so far forward in his seat that his interpreter practically slid off her chair in her attempt to reach his ear . The outfit no doubt brought Ysidra back for him , maybe the live Ysidra as well as the dead one . Suddenly he turned his head , and his gaze became directed at the jury , specifically , I felt , at me . <p> I immediately focused on the witness , a woman who made her living by " helping a lady . " She used to find ladies for Ysidra to help . " Me and her , we were like sisters . " She did n't think the relationship between Luis and Ysidra had ever been good , though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Luis , who was now only thirty-one , she had left two sons in Dominica who were almost grown men by the time she brought them to the United States . The sons did n't want Luis around , and a few weeks before he shot her , Ysidra had kicked him out after a terrible fight . After that , the friend said , Ysidra had been afraid to leave the house . Still the friend had persuaded her to go to church with her on that Easter Sunday . When the two women left the church , they saw Luis waiting outside in his parked car . The friend told Ysidra to run , and she ran into the bodega across the street , but Luis had seen her and got out of the car with a gun in his hand . <p> The prosecutor passed around pictures of the vehicle taken from several angles  --  you could just make out the cement steps of the church through the side windows . Some of the jurors held them for a long time , as if they contained some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the kind you see all over the West Side in the mornings , the kind I used to take when I worked in offices and would oversleep after Michael 's visits , always being careful to settle the price before I got in . Luis could have been one of my drivers , one of the ones with a crackling radio and a folded newspaper on the front seat . I would never have imagined that the newspaper concealed a gun . <p> Did Luis Benitez carry the .44 with him all the time ? Or did he wake up on Easter Sunday with a plan , just as I did that Saturday morning before Christmas , staying warm under the covers for a while with the idea that seemed to have flown into my brain overnight ? The idea of buying the gift and of taking it to Michael . Was n't that in the spirit of the holidays , was n't it the way people like us should treat each other ? It seemed that with one gesture I could say everything . Whenever I was with Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me what you want , ' he 'd demand , " speak , " but only when he meant I should suggest some variation in our lovemaking . <p> I went out to Broadway that morning and found a gift that would n't look too personal , in case friends of Michael 's were there besides his kids . I convinced myself he would ask me to come in , though part of me did n't think so at all . It was his first Christmas without his wife . I 'd always thought he would eventually leave her , but instead she 'd left him . He got to keep the kids until New Year 's while she was in the Bahamas with her boyfriend . So Luis had his gun , and I had this German cappuccino maker that supposedly produced perfect foam , all nicely wrapped up with a red bow inside a big shopping bag  --  also the card that I 've mentioned . <p> On the second day of the trial , we were shown more photos-these of the bodega where Ysidra had taken refuge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aisle where merchandise had fallen off the shelves  --  bags of potato chips , cans of various things . There had been a great change in Luis  --  maybe his attorney suggested it . He had shaved off his mustache overnight . His real face was round and babyish , rather sweet , actually , not one a woman would have run from . Had he grown the mustache to look older for Ysidra Delgado , more worthy of her respect ? Was the gun he carried into the bodega another stage prop for him ? Was he too afraid of rejection to confront her emptyhanded ? <p> Luis and the victim had often stopped in at the bodega . The owner was the star witness . He had seen everything , the shooting , Ysidra Delgado 's blood on the clean floor of his shop , the cans of Goya beans crashing down with her falling body . He was fat , and he perspired , talking so agitatedly in Spanish that the red-haired translator , who had now positioned herself near the witness stand , would sometimes ask him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lawyer raised questions about some of his testimony , he insisted that Luis had spoken to Ysidra in an absolutely normal tone of voice . " Normal , normaIt " He waved his hands in fury when the lawyer professed disbelief . <p> They kept going over what Luis had said to Ysidra . " Come out to the car . I want to talk to you . " Luis Benitez just kept saying the same thing  --  " I want to talk to you . I want to talk to you "  --  never raising his voice , everything still normal . I thought how angry you could be in a normal voice , how you 'd struggle to keep it level so there 'd be no telltale tremor . You 'd want to show the other person you 're not affected by them , although it 's true you want to talk . Ysidra did n't want to . They never do . But all you 're asking for at first is time  --  enough time to reach the right combination of words . <p> Ysidra tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path . She ran into the aisle full of canned beans and potato chips . There was no way for her to escape . At the end of the aisle was the freezer Luis fired into before shooting Ysidra in the belly . He told the police the gun had dropped out of his hand and gone off accidentally . The police knew this was impossible . <p> We had to be shown the murder weapon . I held it for three seconds , surprised it was so much heavier than it looked . Then came the bullet taken from Ysidra . The bullet was nothing , junk  --  a little piece of useless metal about the size of a Hershey 's Kiss . We passed it along from hand to hand . <p> I 'd never fired a gun in my life , not even in an amusement park . <p> Before dismissing us , the judge told us the case would wrap up tomorrow , and that we 'd better come in with our suitcases  --  all of us , even the alternates . That night I packed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although doubted I would be going anywhere . <p> My fellow jurors were an ill-assorted lot . There was nothing to talk about except Luis Benitez , who could not be talked about at all . The weather was awful , so there was conversation about ice . The youngest juror was always late , so people made jokes about him . He was a musician from the East Village who obviously stayed up all night . He once asked me for half of my tangerine . <p> On the final morning , the regular jurors suddenly bonded . They had all brought in food . The table in the jury room was covered with candy , bagels , bananas , tortilla chips , ginger ales . The court officer was taking orders for free delicatessen sandwiches , because no one would be allowed to go out for lunch . The musician , who was a vegetarian , had to settle for lettuce and tomato on rye . Everyone felt sorry for him . " Have two sandwiches , hon , " one woman said . <p> Luis 's shirt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the interpreter whispered in his ear , he did n't seem to listen . He was staring at the jury , at each one of us , scared and imploring . I wondered if he would remember our expressionless faces . <p> Before the summations , his lawyer called only one witness  --  a psychologist who talked about how Luis Benitez had wet his bed after his mother had abandoned him years ago in Dominica . The prosecutor said that was irrelevant ; the judge sustained the objection . <p> I kept thinking that if Ysidra Delgado had only agreed to listen to Luis Benitez , she might still be alive . That when she ran from him , he did n't know any other way to reach her . And the gun made everything too fast , too irrevocable . If the bullet had missed , he might have continued uselessly hoping she 'd take him back until the hope finally wore itself out . <p> I guess I would have tried to explain this to the other eleven jurors and held out for a lesser charge than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alternate , and the judge told the alternates they would no longer be needed . He thanked us for performing our civic duty , and we even got our free sandwiches . <p> I left the criminal court building and walked out into the empty afternoon , stepping on ice all the way to the subway . <p> I did something late that night I 'd sworn to myself I would n't do . I picked up the phone and called Michael . " I 've been on jury duty ; ' I told him , as if I was returning from a long trip . " And I 've been thinking . Is n't it crazy for us not to talk about what happened ? " <p> " You want what you want " he said . <p> We never spoke again . <p> <p> By JOYCE JOHNSON <p>
