At the precise center of Roby , Texas , on one of the town 's more expensive pieces of real estate , is a crudely made sign : good used clothes 10 cents to $1 . It sits in front of a faded little store and tells you everything you need to know about the economics of this dying cotton-and-cattle town . The average house here costs $30,000 . The average income is barely $20,000 . Everywhere buildings are boarded up , abandoned , sinking in the rust-red dirt . The population is 616 and dwindling . <P> The town needed a miracle . And over Thanksgiving weekend it got one . With a mixture of shock and gratitude , Roby residents learned that 39 of their own had won more than $1 million each in the Texas state lottery . They belonged to a pool of 43 people organized by Peggy Dickson , 48 , a bookkeeper at the town 's cotton gin . Each wagered $10 , enabling the pool to buy 430 tickets . The one that won paid $46.7 million  --  that 's $54,255.81 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or roughly $40,000 after taxes . Dickson had never before organized such a lottery syndicate , and many of its participants had never bought a lottery ticket . " It still does n't feel exactly real , " says Kathy Terry , one of 21 Terry kinfolk who won ( they all are descendants of the town 's founders ) . <P> Roby residents have reason to be suspicious of their good luck , which has been unfamiliar lately . Misfortunes have descended with biblical force : a three-year drought , a continuing plague of boll weevils and crashing cattle prices . Twenty-eight winners were farmers or ranchers , and three-fourths of them were in deep financial trouble . " In June they were fixing to come get our stuff , " says Kathy Terry of the bankers who hold the notes on their farm . " We 've kept it going only because we got a loan from my dad . My husband was already looking around for other work . " Manuel Valdez , 43 , and his wife Susie , 37 , were close to losing Susie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings into only five months before . Manuel , who had stopped by the cotton gin ( owned by the Terrys , of course ) for a cup of coffee and joined the lottery pool on a lark , says they could not have held out much longer . " This month I really did n't even want to come to work , " he says . " I opened the checkbook , and we were down to our last $136 . " Another winner , Gene Terry , 61 , says he had got so far into debt that he had to put up his two small farms as security . " A lot of these farmers just could not have kept farming another year if they had not won , " says Mayor Cecil King .
