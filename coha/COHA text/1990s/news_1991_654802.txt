<p> MORE than a dozen police laboratories around the United States use DNA , the genetic code in every human cell , to perform identity tests . This relatively new forensic technique is rapidly gaining in popularity . <p> " The FBI has trained over 240 crime laboratory technicians from 80 different agencies around the country , " says John Hicks , assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory in Washington , D.C. " Within the next year , I would expect that you would see a tremendous increase in the number of laboratories that are on-line . " <p> The FBI is also laying the groundwork for a national databank of DNA information collected from crime scenes and convicted felons . Such a databank would help in the investigation of crimes and in catching repeat offenders , Mr. Hicks says . <p> DNA - deoxyribonucleic acid - is the molecular basis for heredity . Scientists say that each individual , except for identical twins , has a unique sequence of DNA . <p> But DNA identity tests are increasingly coming under attack . Last month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new trial for a man convicted of raping a 14-year-old disabled girl , saying that the scientific community does not have widely accepted uniform methods for testing and interpreting DNA evidence . In Arizona , a superior court judge ruled that the results of a DNA test could not be introduced in a trial because the apparent scientific accuracy of the test might convince a jury of the defendant 's guilt , even though the scientific community itself has questions about the underlying test . <p> " They 've rushed to the courts with this , instead of doing the real hard groundwork that they need to make a good system , " says Richard Lewontin , a professor of population biology at Harvard University , who is an outspoken critic of DNA iden- tification systems . <p> Proponents of the technology disagree . " Having testified as an expert in over 50 cases , I would say that the introduction and the acceptance of this technology has been very good in the courts , " says Michael Baird , director of research at Lifecodes , a New York company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence has been used in more than 400 cases . <p> Using DNA identity testing , sometimes called " DNA fingerprinting , " scientists say they can determine if two samples of human tissue or bodily fluids came from the same person . The test needs only tiny amounts of genetic information for success : a drop of blood , saliva , or semen , a few hair roots , or a piece of skin . THE tests were pioneered between 1982 and 1986 by Cellmark ( Rockville , Md. ) and Lifecodes ( Valhalla , N.Y. ) . In 1986 , the FBI developed its own system , Hicks says . <p> DNA testing is likely to have the biggest impact in rape cases , says Bruce Budowle , an FBI research chemist . Dr. Budowle notes that " 78 percent of rape cases involve semen . " With the test and a blood sample from the defendant , law enforcement officials say that they can prove if the semen found with a rape victim came from the suspect . <p> Indeed , lawyers and prosecutors have latched onto DNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Shultz , a professor at the University of California 's Boalt School of Law . " The hunger for the DNA evidence is the result of our desire to have the perfect truth , " she says . <p> But as with blood types , critics argue , DNA testing can only prove innocence . If two samples of DNA are different , they came from different people . But if two samples are the same , there is always a chance of a random match , because only a tiny fraction of a person 's DNA is actually analyzed in the test . Scientists then must use statistics to determine the probability of a chance match , which requires knowing the frequencies of different kinds of DNA in the population being studied . <p> The problem , Harvard 's Dr. Lewontin says , is that geneticists really do n't know how many people have the genetic markers used in the tests . " There is a lot of variation from subgroup to subgroup in the American population ... A group of Italian-American extraction might have 200 times the chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the population , he says . <p> " The FBI does n't have the databases for the different subgroups . They ca n't use ( the technique ) to calculate " the probability of the match , he argues . <p> FBI scientists disagree . " The population data ... demonstrates that there is very little difference between the Caucasian subgroups and very little difference between the black subgroups , " Hicks says . " Between blacks and Caucasians there are some differences , but it is remarkable how small those differences are . " <p> Increasingly , the scientific establishment seems to be accepting the legitimacy of the tests . Last summer , a report issued by the US Congress Office of Technology Assessment ( OTA ) concluded that " forensic uses of DNA tests are both reliable and valid when properly performed and analyzed by skilled personnel . " The report called questions about the validity of the technology or the underlying population genetics " red herrings that do the courts and the public a disservice . " <p> What 's needed now , the OTA says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained and tests are uniformly interpreted . Nevertheless , concerns remain about what impact genetic testing will have on the courts and on society at large . <p> A major factor is cost . Although Lifecodes sells a kit that a police laboratory can use to do 50 DNA identification tests for $1,000 , the company itself charges $485 to analyze a single sample , Lifecodes ' Baird says . The cost of labor and laboratory time accounts for the difference . Test results must be presented in court by experts , adding another $800 to $1,200 per day . CIVIL libertarians are more worried by the prospect of large-scale DNA testing . " It seems likely that this technology will lead to a national identification system , " says Dr. Paul R. Billings , chief of genetic medicine at the Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center in San Francisco . <p> Today , police forces and legislatures around the country are trying to establish databanks to hold the DNA of people convicted of violent crimes . Such a databank would make it possible to easily identify repeat offenders - especially for crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assault support groups are very much in favor of this , " says Philip L. Bereano , a professor of engineering and public policy at the University of Washington in Seattle . " It has been proposed that since we take the blood from every newborn , we should just run the DNA test and keep the ( record ) bars on file . " <p> Already California and Virginia have started taking blood samples from convicts before they are released , Hicks says . And , Dr. Bereano says , " Eleven states have the requirement that DNA typing be done of convicted offenders . " <p> DNA stored in such a databank might be later reanalyzed for other purposes . " Political pressures will grow from the private sector - particularly the insurance industry - to get access to that file , " Bereano says . <p> A person 's DNA contains all the individual 's genetic information . Future tests might be able to analyze DNA for predisposition to disease or even behavioral characteristics , such as tendency to violence . People whose DNA tested positive might find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveillance by the police . <p> " My own perspective is that it is relatively easy to set up administrative controls to limit the use of and limit access to those kinds of samples , " Hicks says . " It would be relatively easy to establish sanctions against those who might abuse the samples . "
