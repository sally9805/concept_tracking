DEAR B. , <p> This is about as far away from you as I will ever be . I 'm at the cottage on the lake , deserted now at the beginning of September by all but the heartiest of the summer people . I came out here to close the place after the rest of the family went home to Montreal . Once I 'd stripped the beds and polished the kitchen and vacuumed the floors and scoured the toilets , I felt I deserved a swim , so I put on a bathing suit and went down to the lake in the hour that Hebrew calls " between the suns . " A chipmunk scampered out of my way down the stairs and under the porch . An unseasonal fly brushed my arm as I crossed the grass to the dock . After that , everything was so still that no matter how smooth I tried to make my strokes they sliced the water like a defilement . I swam for what seemed a very long time when , suddenly , I heard the love-sick trilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That loon 's cry is making me wild . <p> Normally the loon utters a long call , like a small shofar on the High Holidays . I listen to it sometimes in the middle of the night , wondering how a solitary sound can be so soothing . I imagine the trees , black silhouettes , framing the water , the moon barely visible from behind the clouds , and that motionless , elegant bird illuminated in a peacefulness as rich as Eden 's . If I can persuade myself that I am similarly suspended on the cool water among the tall trees , I fall back into a calm sleep . <p> The loons around here have grown quite tame . When we first began coming to the Adirondacks I thought they were extinct ; only their images were preserved on regional postcards and doorstops . Nowadays , it looks as though the Parks Commission has won at least part of its battle for the preservation of the environment . When you row out on the lake a loon may approach to within an oar 's length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't seem to mind intrusions on even their deepest privacy . This late in the year , I do n't suppose it could be the cry of their mating I hear out there in the bay , but still its vibration stirs the blood . <p> Stirs my blood . As at that other shore at Dahab when we uttered small cries of our own . I have n't thought about that night for years ( after years of thinking about that night ) and I was n't eager to be reminded of it , let alone out here among the horny loons . But now that the memory 's pierced me , I 'm crazy with restlessness like a teenager , may God help me . I 've tried so hard to discipline my wayward desires ( quack , quack ) , to wear what my children call teacher 's shoes , to let my hair turn gray as proof of aging flesh ( quack , quack ) , to walk five miles a day , play sweaty tennis , perform many pious deeds to tame the beast within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle-aged , besides . <p> That quacking , incidentally , is an invention not of mine but of Saul Bellow in one of his novels . When I first came upon his aging man 's mockery of an ageless man 's desire , I laughed , as a young woman does who imagines the bird is in pursuit of her . But by now the laughter has died . <p> I 'VE never understood how I could have spent almost the whole of that first day in your presence without noticing you . Let me say in self-defense that the scene greeting me at the parking lot when I turned up at 6 A.M. was so different from what I had expected that it took me quite a while to get my bearings . Believe it or not , I was by then looking forward to solitude . My husband was holed up in a Jerusalem legal office with the battling parties who were one of the reasons for our trip to Israel ; instead of the two days he had thought the deal would take to straighten out , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time we were scheduled to return to Montreal . Unaccountably , this hurtled me down a chute of self-pity . I had arranged for babysitters back home , planned two weeks of meals and activities for the kids so that my husband and I could take a bit of vacation , and there I was , at the end of summer , with a full year of teaching awaiting me back home and without the excursion I had been promised . So I decided to take one on my own . <p> I thought of traveling through the Galilee , but the Hofsteins recommended a Sinai trip like the one they had taken over Passover , and that 's how I got the idea of six days in the desert . Their descriptions were all of sand and sea  --  the only human element they mentioned was the storehouse of the bones of deceased monks at the monastery of Santa Katherina . About the climb up Mount Sinai , advertised as the climax of the trip , they said nothing , though they did allow that I might be interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to me until I showed up at dawn with my borrowed sleeping bag and canteen and saw the two open trucks filling with people that this was not going to be a solitary adventure but an extended overnight camping trip , the sort of thing that in my countless seasons at summer camp I would have gone to any lengths to avoid . <p> What a disaster ! Once again I had been robbed of my promised vacation , only this time I had no one to blame but myself and my own lack of imagination . The worst moment occurred when one of the guides invited all English speakers to get into one truck and all French speakers into the other ; and because French speakers were in the minority , would those of us who understood French be good enough to join the second group , so that we could travel with our appropriate guide ? Oh God ! A guide ! Lectures on the habits of the Bedouin , and on the hieroglyphics of the ancient Habiru ! And in French !  --  because , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choked with dismay , I could never resist an appeal to my civic duty . Before the outsized jeep even turned a wheel , I had given up any hope of pleasure . <p> I suppose that 's the best way to set out on any venture  --  drained of hope , dumb , sore , miserable . I found myself an outside seat in back where the sand and dust soon began to transform me into a caked desert creature . For a couple of hours the only use I made of my mouth was to sip regularly , as instructed , from the canteen . By the time we stopped at our first watering hole  --  a shack along the road with an outhouse in back and something frying on a hot plate in the broiling sun-my spirits had begun to improve . The parched texture of my hair and jeans and the inside of my throat reassured me that civilization was being left behind . <p> And naturally , no sooner did my craving for solitude begin to be satisfied than it yielded to curiosity . In front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this trip as a treat between high school and the army . This much I made out from their fumbling conversation in French with the chatterbox who sat beside them . The girl directly in front of me had a rosy neck with a marvelously thick black braid , while the one on the inside was blond and tanned , as though she had already spent the summer on army maneuvers . <p> What made me notice the dark one especially was the way she kept stealing a look at our driver , Dudu . If you recall , he stopped the car once on a rise above Jericho to tell us something about the city , and he could claim a girl 's interest , no doubt of that . He was short , muscular , and bronze , and as I had watched him change from jeans to bathing trunks before he got into the driver 's seat I knew there was no line either at belly or thigh to indicate any lighter color of skin . I linger on his physique because there was little else about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me seemed smitten on the spot ; the fantasy she would spin out for the next few days would , I thought , probably constitute her first real brush with love . <p> Still , at that point I was n't really looking around . I did learn that the chatterbox was a lapsed nun from a convent in Switzerland . Behind me were an Italian father and son and beside them two French fellows making a play for Janie , the sophomore from Harvard . I heard a French Canadian accent that later turned out to belong to a teacher from Trois Rivieres . The pair beside me , honeymooners , slept . Do you remember any of this ? <p> IT WAS when we picked up those two French couples in Eilat that you first caught my eye . I wish I could say it was you that I noticed  --  what I noticed was your reaction to them . Had this been a movie , the music would have soared , along with your expressive eyebrow , marking the onset of The Plot . Even today , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people coming toward us from the hotel , so utterly implausible that either they or we would have had to be embarrassed by our encounter  --  and they , like royalty , were not about to be embarrassed . <p> The men were strictly accompaniment : two studs in aviator glasses with gold trim that matched the white-and-gold pattern of their shirts . They looked as if they had been making for the ocean and had stumbled inland by mistake . The woman on the arm of the stouter , rough-looking man was the most beautiful I had ever seen , her hair that cascade of yellow and gold that you see in commercials for expensive shampoos . Her face was perfectly serene , like the surface of the lake here in front of me or a baby 's smile after nursing . Her skin was honey , and so much of it in view ! She was wearing iridescent blue-and-silver satin shorts in a style I saw featured in Vogue the following summer , and a halter of matching white satin . The contents of the latter would have seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been for the woman beside her , dressed almost identically , but with large , softly bobbing breasts that every male hand must have been itching to steady . This second , dark lady had a hilly nose and pockmarked skin , but no pity needed to be wasted on her homeliness . Her breasts and the vitality that kept them in motion sent out a challenge of their own : that one may be made for the canvas , but I 'm for the sheets . And as though to complete the symmetry , hers was the handsomer of the two men . <p> What kept the breasts bobbing , then and for the rest of the trip , were the three-inch heels of her sandals . At the sight of those preposterous stilts our guides should have administered a brief lecture on the requirements of desert travel , promised a refund , and turned the foursome back . Had n't the information leaflet specified good walking shoes and sensible dress for the kind of journey that had taken the children of Israel forty years to complete , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have conversed with God ? Those heels were a breach of contract , an insult to us and to the desert . I suppose that they were also a sign of royalty , advertising its contempt for the bourgeoisie . Whatever , they had the effect of subduing us all . Our trained desert guides could no more have contravened the wishes of these imperious strangers than we could take our eyes off them . Obligingly , the guides loaded their Gucci luggage into the back of the truck , and helped those bimbos up the steps ! <p> I was incensed , but you were amused . You must have recognized that any man with a bone in his body would have done the same . That 's exactly what you said to me hours later when we were leaving the campfire . " You ca n't really blame the guides . Any man with a bone in his body would have done the same . " How could I help falling in love with you ? <p> There 's time now  --  what else but time , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ask then : such as , what made you want me ? How soon were you sure you had me ? How much did you enjoy me ? To tell the truth , though , the reassurance I once needed through this line of questioning has either been satisfied or else it has dissipated ; my curiosity turns philosophical with age . Right now I 'm wondering whether we would have acted so precipitously had those French sensualists not joined our company , and had we not been obliged to sit as involuntary witnesses in the rows behind them all that long first afternoon . The sight of them tossing cigarette butts and then empty cigarette packs over the side of the truck in defiance of the guides ' explicit instructions and the ex-nun 's tearful plea not to " torture the desert "  --  did n't that undermine our respect for the rules ? Or Martine washing her painted toenails  --  her toenails !  --  with the water we had been told was as precious as diamonds ? And when they caressed with fingertips and eyes , were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't they succeed ? <p> Understand , I 'm not looking for excuses here . Quite the contrary . Our adultery would have been shameful ( as well as sinful ) if I had known it was inspired by barbarians . I 'm only wondering whether the behavior of those four did n't goad us into shedding some of the burdens of morality that we had brought with us on this trip , along with our solid walking shoes . <p> That first night , for example . Suppose that after supper the guides had gathered us around the campfire for the obligatory evening program and asked us to make our introductions .... Hello , I 'm Anna from Indiana . Marie from Paree . Chaim from Yerushalayim . Nadiv from Tel Aviv . We would have sat there , you and I , as dutifully as we had sat all day long . We would have joined in the singing of " Hava Nagila " and " Everybody Loves Saturday Night , " not merely complying with our group leaders but solicitous of their attempt to create the illusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de corps  --  meaning the body collective rather than the body private . Finally , damped like the fire by so much induced enthusiasm , we would have gone to our separate sleeping bags under the stars . " Good night , " we would have said to one another . " See you tomorrow . " <p> But the guides had been intimidated . When the Frenchmen refused to do their assigned clean-up after supper , the guides fell back on a strategy of self-defense . Feigning indifference , they stuffed the potatoes back into the supply bags , doused the fire , sent us off to bed without song or story . We were left to fend for ourselves . You came over to me then and as we walked in the direction of the sleeping bags , you said there was no point in blaming the guides ... intimating that all men are the same when the blood begins to pound . I was very happy to take the cue . <p> I WAS not a sexual novice by the time we met . In addition to many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on otherwise miserable Montreal midwinter afternoons . I was also a serious reader : from texts of the sexual revolution that was then poisoning the atmosphere faster than acid rain I had been instructed that the real duty of a wife was not to her husband , but to her genitalia . As part of that dubious teaching I had been told about my natural right to satisfaction , and about techniques for achieving that satisfaction . Out there in the desert it was all beside the point . " Vilde khaye "  --  wild animal  --  my mother had shouted at me one day when as a teenager I went crashing in a rage around the kitchen . ( She mistook my calculated rebellion against her for genuine loss of control . ) With you I really did feel like a wild animal . I could n't repossess my trembling body . I realized in myself the frightening properties of fire . <p> During the daytime we were very well behaved . We barely touched , as if to demarcate our moral and aesthetic distance from the two French couples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if by magic we came upon a shaded pool in a wadi and went in for a dip , our thighs happened to brush in the water and we swam apart as if burned . Without conferring , I think we both considered it a point of pride to remain undiscovered for the duration of the trip . Maybe we even worked harder to prove ourselves good citizens . In the mornings I scoured the breakfast pans whether or not it was my turn . You were the first to leap down and help the guides when the truck developed a flat . Gradually , you began to be entrusted with some of their unraveled authority , and people with problems came to you instead of to them . The ex-nun wanted you to help arrange some privacy for body functions ; you suggested that whenever we stopped for lunch or supper the trucks be placed in a certain formation and that an area beyond them be blocked off for " toilets . " The guides went along with your solution . Having once yielded to semi-savages , they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I were the secret savages , swollen with pleasure at night , lean with restraint by day . <p> Have you ever read Tristan and Isolde , that profoundly un-Jewish love story ? It ambushed me in a course on Romanticism during my sophomore year in college . Tristan the loyal servant is sent to bring back Isolde , the bride of his beloved master King Mark , much as in Chapter 24 of Genesis the servant of Abraham is instructed to seek out and bring back a bride for Isaac . But how different are the complications in the Gentile tale ! The nurse who accompanies Isolde on her sea voyage ( quite unlike the careful nurse who accompanies Rebecca ) has taken along a magical love potion to be drunk by the king and his queen at their wedding , thus ensuring their abiding love . Before the destination is reached , however , there is a huge storm at sea , during which Tristan and Isolde accidentally slake their thirst with that magical drink . There is no help for them thereafter . " And they gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This same act of unholy fornication  --  which in the Bible carries the threat of punishment unto the tenth generation ( because its consequences can so easily work their way unto the tenth generation )  --  the medieval narrator exalts for its tragic purity . He does n't just bring these lovers together and shrug his shoulders at the fateful mistake ; he adores their sin , the sin that will lead ineluctably to their deaths , and invites us to feel the frantic absolutism of their passion . Isolde , who betrays both men , looms as the holy grail of Tristan 's quest . And Tristan , betrayer of the master to whom he has pledged obedience , is treated by the narrator almost as an erotic Christ . These earthly lovers are sanctified and doomed , paying with their martyrdom for an attachment of such intensity . Through the beauty of the text , their utter surrender to passion routs all notions of marital fidelity . <p> Much has been written about the political and religious meaning of this idea of love in the Western world , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its history or source . Had I been asked to describe love prior to the reading of Tristan and Isolde , I would have invoked the sturdy affection of my mother and father who held hands when they came to visit me one summer at camp , and whose marriage , crowded with bills and intestinal maladies , was as flawed as ordinary life tends to be . Came the Tristan legend to teach that forbidden love was not only stronger but ever so much " holier " than the sanctified kind . Thanks to you , I had a chance to test that proposition . <p> Did I say earlier that the two French couples seemed regal in their contempt for the rest of us ? Only at first . Their physical grace and glittering attire set them apart for a time , but they were too coarse to keep our interest for very long and , in fact , once its novelty wore off , their vulgarity was as predictable as the public propriety of small-town churchgoers . You and I , on the other hand , became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , our innocent public utterance spiked with provocative private allusions . Making camp , breaking camp , preparing food  --  everything that involved our hands and fingers pointed to the night of pleasure ahead of us , and whenever our eyes caught in the process , became part of an extended foreplay . Because we kept it hidden , our attraction to one another acquired mysterious intensity , and we were like members of a secret sect whose superiority battens on their pretended normalcy . We became conspirators as well as lovers , and how can ordinary experience , even " ordinary " love , compete with the excitement of subterfuge Pricked by the danger of discovery , and hallowed by intervals of abstinence , we gave ourselves up utterly to love . <p> IF I AM NOT mistaken , something changed in the nature of the trip the day we climbed Mount Sinai . By then , we had all grown accustomed to being ferried around by truck on a prearranged itinerary complete with " unexpected " discoveries of pools of rainwater in the wadis and ancient carvings on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a small convoy of military jeeps among the sand dunes was probably no surprise to the guides , who must have been briefed about everything going on in the area . Whatever little we did for ourselves , such as building the fire and cleaning up , we were called upon to do as part of an established routine , but it was n't we who planned the meals or decided how far we should travel each day . Once we had left behind the well-stocked vehicles , though , and set out on foot with our supplies on our backs , we reverted into the loose collection of individuals we had been originally , of varying sizes , shapes , levels of energy , spirit , and will . On foot , we resumed for the first time individual responsibility for our progress . <p> These adjustments might have gone very smoothly . By the standards of mountaineering Sinai is an easy climb , no more than two hours or so for good hikers . Tsvi , because he was the tallest guide , would have stayed in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbers around him certain landmarks or quirks of the path . The second guide would have sustained the middle of the group with anecdotes or songs , while Dudu held up the rear with encouraging praise and reassurance . That , at any rate , was how we started out , and the ease with which the guides set the pattern suggests how often and effortlessly they had done it before . <p> Martine 's high heels tripped them up . It began as a joke , her bobbing up the mountain supported by her two pieds noirs ( as by then they had been dubbed ) with the gorgeous Chantale giggling merrily alongside . The foursome had been functioning in any case as a group within the group , rarely speaking to the rest of us except to complain to the guides , and there was a certain relief in putting them out of sight at our rear . But as the peals of merriment kept falling farther behind , the groups were in danger of splitting off , and every time the guides tried to hold us back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew bolder . Why had she been allowed to come on the climb in defiance of all sanity and safety ? Why should we respect the needs of people who did n't know the meaning of respect ? How could trained guides have sacrificed all of us to the whims of one spoiled brat ? The sandal-metronome kept slowing us down , until it stopped altogether and then news traveled up the line that one of the lady 's heels had broken off and gone tumbling down the rocks . A chorus wished its owner a similar fate <p> MY GOD , how the pent-up furies exploded then ! Everyone seemed to be shouting at once , down the mountain at Martine and her companions , at the guides , at one another . The Italian father swore that if Tsvi did not proceed immediately with him and his son and whoever else was ready to advance , he himself would lead the group . The anger I had felt when they first joined our company in Eilat , eclipsed by stronger emotions during the intervening days , was now back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guides by setting out for the top of the mountain at the fastest possible clip . I noticed that even for the honeymooning pair the idyll was suspended . The bridegroom was hollering that he would report the guides to the tour company for having endangered the group , and the bride sulked unbecomingly . <p> As I recall , two people stayed calm . One was the lapsed nun from Switzerland who began to make her way down the mountain to where Martine was stranded in her damaged slippers so that she might offer the distressed damsel the sturdy sandals off her own feet . Passing us on her way she explained that with her hardened soles and greater experience as a climber she could proceed barefoot , whereas Martine 's handicap might force us all to abandon our project . When the plan was broached to Martine , she accepted as a matter of course , and pronounced the flat sandals not a bad fit . Pure egoists are the greatest beneficiaries of pure Christians . I was not as angry with Martine as I was with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any longer as " lapsed , " because she was obviously still in the grip of the same self-abnegating idea that had impelled her to enter the convent . <p> I was angriest with the guides , for permitting this travesty . They allowed the nun to atone for their gross error of judgment . Instead of protecting her right to enjoy the trip she had paid for , they sacrificed her convenience for their own . You may have felt similarly dissatisfied , because with calm authority it was you who took over the leadership of the group from that point on . I do n't know exactly what you said to the guides , but we were told to start moving ahead with you as our new anchor . Dudu would drop behind to oversee the foursome , now joined by the nun . If they ran into any more difficulties , he would summon help with his walkie-talkie , but otherwise they would proceed at their own pace , we at ours . If they could n't make it to the top , they would return to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The day was well advanced by then , and the early start that was intended to give us a jump on the sun had been lost along with the broken heel . It grew hotter as we climbed . Despite the heat , we of the main group forced ourselves up at a very brisk pace , scampering over rocks , pulling one another up over difficult spots . Once or twice we were reminded to drink from our canteens , but otherwise no one said very much , neither the guides to explain nor we to inquire . At the narrowing top of the mountain we discovered , with a mixture of gratitude and annoyance , the carved steps into the stone and small railings of wood that previous travelers had provided at the steepest points . Their welcome assistance was a less than welcome reminder that we were part of a relentless tourist stream and that those following us , the likes of Martine and her companions , would in years to come undoubtedly agitate for a paved road or a chairlift for their greater convenience . <p> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had heaved ourselves out on the plateau and arrived at our destination . A lyric from my teenage folksinging days came unbidden to memory , drowning out all the more exalted phrases of Scripture : " If I could I surely would / Stand on the rock where Moses stood .... " There we were indeed , standing in the footsteps of Moses . <p> THE landscape that greeted our eyes up there could not have changed very much in the millennia since Moses ' sojourn : hills of yellowing orange , some slightly higher and some slightly lower than the mountain designated as Sinai , stretching out to the horizon beyond . If sand and wind had caused some alteration in the shape and hues of the surrounding hills and valleys , they had n't reduced the expanse of barrenness . The scene from where we stood was nowhere as stark as , say , Mount Washington above the tree line where you crawl over blackening rocks and feel the frightening aspect of the original primeval chaos  --  the biblical tohu vavohu . I 've never climbed the Himalayas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures to their glory or their doom . Sinai reminded me rather of the midrash that asks how so unassuming a mountain was given the honor of so remarkable an event . It was Moses who conferred grandeur on the mountain , not the mountain on Moses . When the Law was given to those who agreed to be bound by it , its reception transformed that otherwise ordinary mound of sand and stone into a holy site . <p> You made a comment there that I 've never forgotten : you said it was a strange place to have conceived the Law . At the time , I was touched by your apparent identification with Moses as a fellow " lawyer " and by the word " conceived , " which left open all the questions of authorship . Your metaphor cleverly credited Moses with having borne the Torah through its long period of gestation without specifying the impulse , divine or human , of its conception . <p> Thinking about your comment now , I 'm struck by another aspect altogether , not the who but the what . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have conceived the Law . Is that what you meant ? Moses was the leader-guide of a rabble of former slaves crossing the desert on their way back from Egypt to their own land , Eretz Yisrael . At a certain point on this arduous journey , he abandoned his quarreling charges and retired for forty days to the top of this mountain . Why else remove yourself from the encumbrance of slaves if not to burst free into a purer air Solitary at last , an audience of one , he would have registered every item of Cod 's repertoire  --  each glint and echo , spoor of life , crumble of sandstone . Sun-scorched , he might have entertained visions of angels floating down from the heavenly cloud-beds to fan his brow . <p> From Moses on the mountain , one would have expected the Psalms . Or else he might have probed the mysteries of creation . With God as his only company he would have yearned to learn the secrets of His power . What drew up the sun from the well of night , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at once so sturdy and so fragile ? <p> Incredibly , Moses thought about none of this . He had withdrawn from those slaves at the foot of the mountain only so that he might return to them a better guide . Exhausted by the daily effort of keeping discipline in their ranks , he had realized that no single person could maintain order for anyone else . Unless these dissatisfied men and women began to assume greater responsibility for themselves and one another , they would either murder him in the desert and die there after him or else deteriorate as they watched him grow feeble . He had to absent himself temporarily from their squabbles and the smallness of their desires so as to conceive for them a dignified way of life . <p> Through all of this , it never occurred to him that his fate might be independent of theirs . Even the love he felt when he reached up to caress God 's face in the heavens at night reminded him that he had yet to instill that love in His children down below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he carved the laws on the tablets as he would have to inscribe them still more laboriously on their souls . One does not have to stand in awe of God : it is enough to stand in awe of Moses . <p> Anyway , our trip was not quite the same after that . Odd , how many conversations we entered into on the way down the mountain with people we had n't previously spoken to at all . The two boys who had been trying to pick up the Harvard coed and had merged with her into a comradely threesome  --  it turned out that their fathers , who ran small textile factories in Lyons , came from Bialystok , as did my own father , also in textiles . We exchanged addresses , and a few weeks later my father actually received a letter from one of their parents , asking after lost relatives . And together , you and I discovered that the French Canadian from Trois Rivieres was on the trip because of a book she had read on the Holocaust ; the purpose of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus had been one , and whose fate theirs so resembled . She had applied for a job as a French teacher in a Montreal Jewish day school , and meant to use the pictures she was busily snapping as classroom material . I suggested that her students might benefit more from her intimate knowledge of Trois rivieres , but nothing could puncture her zeal . <p> Late that afternoon we made our most startling discovery . It was when we were sitting around in the long shadow of the trucks after the last stragglers had rejoined us . The guides had brought us a bag of dried fruit and nuts to pass around , and as you handed it to the person beside you he said " todah , " thank you , in Hebrew . " Ata medaber ivrit ? , " do you speak Hebrew ? you asked him unsteadily . " Betakh , " he replied , of course , in a Hebrew accent more native than yours . <p> HE THEN began explaining  --  this man we had known only as the husband of Martine  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family , he had served in the army , and that now he had brought his wife , her brother , and his sister-in-law on this outing to show them where he had been wounded in the Six-Day War of 1967 . We had , in fact , passed the battle site on our way to the mountain the previous day . He had been hurt quite badly , and his reconstructed knee still gave him a bit of trouble . ( Was it possible , then , that Martine 's heels were a fond wife 's ingenious camouflage for his handicap ? ) Now he lived on Rue Mozart in Paris and , in partnership with his brother-in-law , ran a large store of children 's clothing . In the summer he visited his family in Israel . <p> It had been , he continued , a mistake for Martine to attempt the climb in those unsuitable shoes , but the two women had been intending to stay at the campsite , and had something unforeseen not occurred the night before they would never have set out . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In her dream the stars had issued her an invitation to the top of the mountain where " Moise " had been given the Law , and in the morning she had refused to be left behind . His wife had a strong will . She had been raised in Morocco in a very religious household , and had memorized whole sections of the Torah , although she otherwise knew not a word of Hebrew . When they finally got to the top ( after most of us had already begun our descent ) his wife had declaimed the Ten Commandments . <p> I did n't hear most of this conversation as I was sitting quite a distance from you , and people kept passing back and forth between us while you spoke with him . I do n't recall exactly what I felt when you told me about it that night . Surprise , certainly , and confusion . It occurred to me that the guides and some of us Hebrew speakers had said unpleasant things about the French couples , assuming they could not understand us , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was Martine 's husband impervious to insult , or had he pretended not to hear so as to protect his wife from the things being said about her ? In a sense , their behavior was cast in an even more disturbing light by the revelation that they considered themselves proud and self-conscious Jews . Perhaps the Jewish tribe was not so far advanced through the moral discipline of Sinai as some of us had hoped Or , perhaps , the discipline had been eroded through too many migrations and the shocks of modernity . Would their tenuous loyalties to Jewish law and family eventually turn them into worthier people , or did they merely exemplify the abject failure of Jewish civilization in the modern period ? <p> AS WE scrambled to readjust our image of these fellow Jews , our behavior , too , came to seem more disturbing in retrospect . From the moment they joined our group , we had enjoyed the relative sense of virtue their misdeeds conferred on us . But even as their carelessness reinforced our self-righteousness , we allowed it to relax our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familial responsibility for them , we were prepared to condemn what they did rather than trying as our brothers ' keepers to improve them . Without for a moment excusing them , we might have done better to confront the barbarism ( even if the guides did not ) rather than waiting , like spectators , for The Plot to resolve itself . <p> As I say , I do n't recall exactly how I felt when you told me of your conversation that night , but right now at this moment , trying to untangle my feelings , I 'm tired . If you 've read this letter through , you may be feeling likewise . It 's a tiredness I recognize as moral battle fatigue , and it must be connected with all the many claims of duty that by now harry the mind and soul . Just look at my perversity : a bolt of desire summons up the memory of you , and I sit down to write because I want to keep it momentarily alive . On paper at least , I want to recover what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of retrieving that stab of pleasure I spin out the very net of morality that will entangle and finally trap me . Sex requires the momentary suspension of moral disbelief . " And they gave themselves up utterly to love " must be attended by " And they saw that it was good . " I am approaching the point in our narrative when we could no longer give ourselves up to love because we could no longer believe that it was good . <p> Are you smiling at my use of the plural pronoun ? Do n't worry . I am not suffering from loss of memory , or resorting to poetic license . It was you alone who decided that we would have to leave our love behind in the desert because it could n't be adapted to the requirements of civilization . I fought you with every argument in my arsenal . You were the one who explained , and soothed , and cajoled , and reassured , and who finally convinced me not through any of your manifold powers of persuasion , but because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have you against your will . You forced me to accept a decision you had reached on your own . Yet , having accepted the decision that you forced on me , am I not entitled to join you in it ? <p> The beach at Dahab where we spent the last night was much rockier than the sandy terrain of the desert . I could feel the stones in my back through both sleeping bags , and I thought you were referring to that bruising pressure from the ground when you asked me , so uncharacteristically , " Am I hurting you ? " Tears of pleasure sprang to my eyes at that marriage of your power within me and your solicitude over me . I wanted you to stay and root yourself inside me like a tree , there in that inhospitable ground . But your question was deceptive , perhaps the only dishonesty of which I could ever accuse you . You were referring not to pain of the moment  --  by that time you were at least as stone-pocked as I  --  but to the terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as soon as this final thrust was over , to " hurt " me ever again . You had decided that at the point of rejoining our spouses and resuming our regular lives we would have to become loving friends instead of lovers . We would have to abide by the seventh commandment . I would never feel the sweet rise of you inside me again . <p> LET ME tell you what I 've told you before : I could not have done what you did . The rest of that night , and during most of the next day when you gave what may well have been the most inspired legal address of your life , you persuaded me that you were trying to keep us together rather than drive us apart . Whatever callow motives I ascribed to you , I came to believe that you were right . We were not Tristan and Isolde , after all , but someone else 's husband and someone else 's wife , and we would not be able to sustain for very long a tawdry double life . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rendezvous in a hotel room between four and five in the afternoon and then later bumping into one another on parents ' night in the high school where we both intended to send our children  --  were realistic and ugly . If adultery in an age of effective birth control skirted the biological hazards of earlier times , it still undeniably retained enough poisoning powers to destroy most of family loyalty and family life . Impossible to have to lie perpetually in answer to such simple questions as , where are you going , what did you do this afternoon , without deforming the basic trust of our two marriages . There was too much love in our young families to warrant undoing them for the promise of love between you and me , and that being the case , there was too much to risk in the permanent masquerade that a love affair would require . <p> But I was startled when you even went so far as to invoke Judaism as a standard for civilizing ourselves . That was probably the first time I heard anyone , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guide to right action . Having been raised without regard for the specific directives of Jewish law , I had come to regard Jewishness as a kind of innate idea of right action , one that , having been born an ethical Jew , I could presumably adjust indefinitely to my own desires . Suddenly , you were telling me that being a Jew meant accepting the discipline of a Jew ; that the mountain we 'd climbed for adventure was a place of true consequence . <p> Naturally , I 've often suspected you of feeling a lesser degree of desire for me than I felt for you , of wanting to dump me for convenience 's sake , using morality for your excuse . But attributing motives to you is an exercise in solipsism , since I can never know your motives , even assuming that you could . Rejection is what most of us imbibe with our mother 's milk , and we are as much attracted to it as we are to the nurturing love that is so often its accompaniment . The many times I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursed some ancient deprivation that has little to do with you , although it has obviously been important to me to believe that it issued from you . In the long run , what truly mattered was not your motive , but your words and the deeds they confirmed . All those hundreds of subsequent occasions when we spoke on the phone or talked over coffee or lunch I stood ready to scrap my " morals " with the same abandon that Martine lost the heel of her shoe . Maybe knowing that made it easier for you to police us . Certainly , he laws of Sinai alone could never have disciplined me . What contained me finally was that you said no . <p> Improbably , you taught me loyalty , which God makes the basis of His covenant . The modern temper distrusts loyalty on many counts  --  psychologically , for breeding passivity ; intellectually , for stifling creativity ; socially , for encouraging conformity ; politically , for fostering tyranny . The experimental modern temper finds in loyalty the foil of elasticity , or a threat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Jewish intellectuals may work the hardest of all to establish their independence from a collective association that makes great demands from within and exposes them to embarrassing assaults from without . <p> But I think the arguments you once mounted against adultery are also the basis of every other kind of discipline . The opposite of loyalty is disloyalty , a rotten quality , however attractively it dissembles itself . Psychologically , it breeds selfishness ; intellectually , it rewards lying ; socially , it cultivates irresponsibility ; politically , it invites tyranny . Although every rebel claims to be Prometheus defying the power of Zeus in order to bring warmth to humankind , or Spartacus defying the power of Rome in order to bring freedom to slaves , these claims depend  --  do n't they  --  on the nature of the law that is being defied . When you belong to a people that upholds freedom above all , opposition to its authority is really a blow against freedom . Civilization today depends on our willingness to remain a part of it . <p> WELL , my longing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be effortlessly moral . I do n't welcome exertion for its own sake , but we incipient sinners have a pungent appreciation of the fruits of the moral life . Maybe because I had to give up something precious for their sake , the simple lines of attachment that bind me to my husband and our children and friends and families become more precious with time . Not the least of my gains is that I 've been able to love you unstintingly , just as you are , a family man . These may be staid pleasures compared to the thrills I sometimes crave , but they are generous pleasures , that can be enjoyed shamelessly before all the world . They will have to suffice . <p> WITH ALL MY HEART  --  L. <p> RUTH R. WISSE , a veteran contributor to COMMENTARY , is professor of Yiddish literature at McGill University .
