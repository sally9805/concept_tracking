Bart Simpson , we trust , is prouder than ever of his pal Michael Jackson . When he recently ceded some Fox network airtime so that the new Jackson video Black or White could debut in style , there was a great outcry . The video was violent ! The video was dirty ! Michael 's moves would incite kids to unspeakable acts of autoeroticism and social outrage ! Perfect . Bart and Michael , soul mates forever . <P> Now that the commotion has died down and the album been released , one thing must be said : Michael sings better than Bart . Dances better too . But Bart has the edge in humor . Dangerous lacks only the Simpson sass to make it a dazzler . As it is , the album is merely terrific . <P> The Black or White track is driven by an infectious riff that sounds like prime Keith Richards . In fact , Slash of Guns N ' Roses is the guitar man here . Once again Michael proves to be the grand master at pulling together all sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seamless whole . He may be reluctant to show his face  --  only his eyes , a lock of hair and a tiny image of the child star of the Jackson 5 appear in the album art  --  but he is fearless about his feelings . Every one of these 14 songs is out front and unashamed , whether in the soulful snap of In the Closet or the smoothly streetwise Why You Wan na Trip on Me ? In his music , the reclusive Michael never gives himself a hiding place . <P> This is most clear late in the album , beginning with Will You Be There , a song that sounds a little like Paul McCartney 's Liverpool Oratorio and a lot like a spiritual scored for the first cathedral in outer space . Lush , sentimental sounds continue through the next two tunes before things settle back to the hard rhythm of Black or White . It 's a virtuoso performance . Michael may wear his heart on his sleeve , but a fair portion of his soul , it seems , is still back in church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
