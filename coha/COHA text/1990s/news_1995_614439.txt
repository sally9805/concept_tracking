<p> More homework ? Get serious <p> In response to the recent article , " America , do your homework , " I would like to make a few comments . I am a 17-year-old high school junior at Fulton County 's Chattahoochee High School . One 's junior year is known to be the most difficult . My current course load consists of algebra II , chemistry , U.S. history , honors British literature , Spanish II and advanced placement art . Each teacher is convinced that their class is the most important and takes it upon themselves to give as much work as humanly possible . <p> According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution article , " American high school students spend as much time watching TV each weekday as they spend on homework all week . " I refuse to believe this statement . I can not recall the last time I had a chance to even watch TV for more than half an hour . I get home from school at 5 p.m. and start my homework right away . I am fortunate to finish before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing but " banal . " <p> During school sports season , TV , much less a social life , is practically out of the question if one wants to graduate with at least a 3.5 grade-point average . Completing all of one 's homework is even more difficult for those with after-school jobs . Teens involved in sports and jobs do not return home until 10 p.m . These students finish their schoolwork close to 2 a.m . <p> The Atlanta Journal-Constitution article also mentioned that " Americans did 22 percent less homework than Asians . " Perhaps this is true , but these same countries also have an incredibly higher suicide rate . Is it any wonder why ? <p> If anything needs to be done about America 's homework situation , it is that less homework needs to be given . More homework is not going to make for smarter students . After a while , we just start to make up answers to fill the page to get it over with . What teens today really need is to feel like they are appreciated and loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a sense of pride in their country . <p> Who taught children hatred ? Jimmy Zoll , Alpharetta <p> On Sunday morning , a minister at our church tried to make sense of the horrible bombings in Oklahoma . He said that when things like this happen , he has to remember that at one time , those who are accused of the crime were children . What happened to these children to cause them to grow into such hateful adults ? <p> I am a teacher . Last week in my classroom a discussion started about President Clinton , who is not incredibly popular in the affluent community in which I teach . When I mentioned his name , one student , who I basically consider a good kid , placed his hands together and carried out a mock assassination of the president . Where did this idea come from ? <p> I will defend the freedom of our nation until the day I die , but there is a pervasiveness of hatred in our society today . It is perpetuated by radio talk-show hosts , members of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ultimate responsibility for the bombings in Oklahoma belongs to those who committed the act , and they deserve the punishment they will receive . Their hatred for the government , their love of explosives and guns , and their contempt for human life , however , was learned . <p> I think President Clinton had it right when he talked of the impact of negative talk radio . Many adults can listen and decipher truth from fiction . Children are different . It is sad to see cynicism and utter disrespect in an 11-year-old boy , but he learned it from somewhere . The Oklahoma bombers were also once children . Much of what we are is biologically based , but to a larger extent , I believe , we are what we see and hear . <p> What 's a guy to listen to ? John Kier , Roswell <p> We heard about disenfranchised white males in the last election , and it is presently assumed that we have such a case in the Oklahoma massacre . As a white male , I am sorry to say that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Specifically , I want to discuss radio since that is a medium I am close to . <p> At one time in this country 's history there were " big bands , " then we had folk , rock , and pop rock , all of which a white male could enjoy . The only music on radio targeting white males in recent years is some genre of the format that calls itself " album rock , " which in reality is nothing more than wall to wall heavy metal with messages of hate , Satanism , and a general doom and gloom mood . <p> Spinoffs such as classical rock are really post-classic and play mostly metal too , and alternative rock has sold out and is mostly metal . Except for country music , which targets mainly rural and blue collar workers , there has been no music radio format that a white male could stomach , as they are either too wimpy , like B98.5 and WPCH , or too black and hip-hop , like Star 94 . Thus , he has to choose one of these metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred , too , of course . <p> I would like to offer Atlanta a radio format that offers upbeat , fun , creative , melodic music , and themes other than hatred and doom in a format . A good example would be a " Forrest Gump " type of format offering initially late 1960s and 1970s music and as in the movie , emphasizing folk , melodic rock , psychedelia and well-written pop songs . We will find and expose compatible new music , giving the white males ( and others too ) a welcome relief from the status quo . <p> Clinton 's leadership lacking Richard E. Barlow , Dunwoody <p> I have frequently heard that the tragic bombing in Oklahoma City has " brought us all together . " While there has been a great outpouring of sympathy and relief effort , we were not allowed to let the bombing unify the American spirit . <p> President Clinton has desecrated the memory of those killed by using the bombing for his own political goals , blaming the bombing on his political opponents . Rather than targeting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservatives as scapegoats . <p> The result has been a virtual flame-fest of letters to the editor . The liberals rush in to condemn conservatives for causing the bombing . Conservatives feel they are unjustly accused and fight back . Those already distrustful of the American government have been given more reason to fear their government . The result has been a greater polarization of the American public . <p> It has been a characteristic of the Clinton administration that every action is based on what will win the most votes , not on the merits of the issue . Such dependence on polls and surveys is the mark of a follower , not a leader . Nowhere has his lack of leadership been more apparent than with his mishandling of the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing . <p> In defense of executions Mack A. Moore , Sandy Springs <p> In a recent letter , Michael P. Gilchrist " abhors " the murders committed by the late Chris Ingram , but insists that " What Ingram did is no different than what the nameless , faceless entity we call ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1983 , Ingram entered the home of J.C . and Eunice Sawyer to commit another in his string of robberies . Not satisfied with the $ 60 and an old pickup , he taunted his victims for an extended period , then tied them to a tree . After beating J.C . with a gun , he finally shot both of them . As I heard the story , when J.C . slumped over , the rope pulled his wife 's head aside and the bullet only grazed her skull ; even under such duress , she had the presence of mind to play dead , which was all that saved her . <p> Ingram chose to render his life totally worthless except to give the Sawyer family a token of relief . That the state spent money on his defense , including endless appeals up to the last minute , is a disgrace of indescribable proportions . <p> By Gilchrist 's perverted logic , if the state convicts and executes the Oklahoma bomber who took 169 lives , then it will be just as bad as what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine . Gilchrist says he is " against the taking of a human life , under any circumstances . " That 's what fanatical anti-abortionists say , including those who have killed abortionists.
