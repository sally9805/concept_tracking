<p> " An airport is just like a candy store to crooks , " said Vincent Bonaventura , general manager of Newark ( N.J. ) Airport . <p> Indeed , travelers bring to airports an impressive array of valuables : suitcases full of new clothes , and possibly jewelry ; cameras , wallets , credit cards and checkbooks ; keys to houses that may be empty , airline tickets , vouchers and passports . And , perhaps most valuable and often vulnerable , automobiles that travelers leave in parking lots for days or weeks . <p> Carjackings are almost unknown in airport lots ; of eight major airports that were surveyed for this story , only Atlanta reported one , in 1992 , and that took place in a rental-car lot . It 's the unattended car and , even more often , its contents and parts , that thieves target . <p> At Newark , airport authorities and a northern New Jersey auto theft task force have cooperated in shutting the shops that take apart stolen autos , and the auto theft rate is down from 1992 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parked . <p> Up to June 19 of this year , 47 of more than 1.9 million parked cars had been stolen , and the recovery rate has been high . <p> However , damage to parked cars and thefts from them in Newark airport lots have been running slightly higher than last year 's rate , according to Capt . Michael Harrington of the Port Authority police : 63 thefts from autos and 60 criminal-mischief reports involving autos in the first quarter of this year , as against 219 and 231 for all of 1992 . <p> At New York City 's Kennedy International Airport , theft of cars , parts and possessions is running close to the 1991 rate after a big drop in 1992 . Tom Middlemiss , a spokesman for the Port Authority , said that from January to April 1993 , 131 automobiles were stolen from the airport 's parking lots ; for the same period in 1992 , the figure was 68 , and for the 1991 period , 127 . <p> In the same four months , there were 82 thefts of objects such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same period of 1992 and 85 in 1991 . Automobile accessories and parts were reported stolen 74 times from January through April of 1993 , 37 in 1992 and 71 in 1991 . Middlemiss was unable to explain the apparent . . . a parking spot should be selected not by how safe it looks when you leave your car there , but by how it will look when you return.drop in crime in 1992 . <p> Even a bare car with a " " no radio , no nothing " sign is not immune to break-in . Auto repair people say a current item for theft is the car 's internal computer that controls the fuel-injection system and other functions , which thieves can remove in six minutes through the dashboard or glove compartment , disabling the car . <p> This device , known as an electronic body module or an electronic control module , has been part of automobile engines since the early 1980s . It has no vehicle identification number on it . A new one costs $ 500 to $ 600 , and a used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One day last month , Don-Glo , an AAA-authorized towing and repair shop in northern Manhattan , had 26 autos in the shop , four of them Pontiacs waiting for replacements for stolen computers . The parts distributor was out of supply , a spokesman said . <p> At Hartsfield Airport in Atlanta , there also are more thefts from cars than thefts of cars : 18 cars were reported stolen in 1992 , while there were 173 thefts of possessions and parts from cars . At the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport , 90 automobiles were stolen from various lots in 1992 , but the Texas Department of Public Safety said that most were rental cars with the keys left inside , which are not included in New York statistics . In 1992 , 145 cars were broken into . <p> At O'Hare in Chicago , 17 autos were stolen from all parking lots ( including rental and cargo lots ) in 1992 , while there were 197 thefts from cars . <p> One of the crime statistics for 1993 represents John G. Stone of Huntington Station , N.Y. , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airport on Feb. 20 to find the locks smashed , the dashboard area ransacked and the car inoperable because , he later learned , the computer was gone . He said the guards on duty that night reported there had been a rash of such computer thefts . ( While he was filing his report , a driver walked up to report his auto stolen . ) <p> A recent training video on vehicle-related crime , " " Reduce Your Risk , " made by F.L.I. Learning Systems with the cooperation of the National Safety Council , discusses where to park . <p> The point is made that a parking spot should be selected not by how safe it looks when you leave your car there , but by how it will look when you return . If you are coming back in the evening , the video says , check where the nearest street light is , the location of the nearest place with activity - a school campus may be fine by day but abandoned at night - and how far you will have to walk by yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the one where Stone parked - a sea of concrete far from airline terminals , lights and pedestrian flow - is a dismal choice . <p> The remote parking lot at Kennedy Airport , Lot 9 , is getting intensified security this summer . Situated outside the terminal buildings that surround the regular lots and garages , and enclosed by a Cyclone fence , the lot contains 40 acres that can accommodate 6,600 autos , half the capacity for the airport 's public lots . <p> It contains four bus stops served by shuttle buses that come from the airline terminals and also from the Howard Beach subway stop of the IND line . Pedestrians can get off without showing a parking ticket or an airline ticket . According to Middlemiss of the Port Authority , each bus stop has two telephones , one linked to the Port Authority police and one for help in a breakdown . <p> The operation is managed by a subcontractor , Five Star Parking , which has a cashier at the exit gate . The entry gate , unstaffed , has a ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Authority police officer has been stationed there in a patrol car . In mid-July , the officer will be replaced by " " tiger teeth " in the drive to impale tires of cars going the wrong way , Middlemiss said . <p> The security subcontractor , Service Link , has roving unarmed guards on duty , their number increased recently from three to four . Two 40-foot observation towers have just been built in the lot , and these were scheduled to go into operation at the end of June , each with one of these guards on duty 24 hours a day . The two other guards will stay on roving patrol , usually following the shuttle buses as they pass through the lot , although not stopping when people disembark . <p> No airport or safety official will say it for attribution , but it is clear that leaving your car in a parking lot at an airport is risky . <p> Instead of parking at the airport , it might be wise to take public transportation , a cab or one of the airport limousine services available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car service for your return . <p> The 15-minute video " " Reduce Your Risk of Being a Victim of a Crime While Driving , Parking or Walking to and From Your Auto " may be ordered from the National Safety Council for $ 57.95 , plus United Parcel shipping , by calling ( 800 ) 621-6244.
