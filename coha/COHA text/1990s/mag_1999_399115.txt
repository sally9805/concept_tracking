<p> U.S. Africa Policy , At Once Cynical And Ignorant , Proves No Match For The Ethnic Complexity And Social Needs Of Modern Nigeria , Conditions Rooted In The Country 's Geography . <p> Port Harcourt <p> There may be 500,000 people in this steamy city in the Nigerian Delta , although no one is certain , and there may be a great many more . There is a carelessness about Port Harcourt ; it was born of an accident in the first place . In 1912 , Frederick Lugard , Nigeria 's first colonial governor , ran his canoe aground while searching for a suitable site to build a port and decided this was as good a location as any  --  forty miles from the Atlantic , on the southern coast of Nigeria , at the uppermost part of the tortuous Delta . Construction has gone on in fits and starts ever since . Tribal villages have been absorbed , and mangrove swamps filled in , although Port Harcourt still looks unloved and unfinished . Half-empty office buildings stand next to tin-roof shanties ; roads have ruts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so has all the rest of the oil-rich Delta . Attention must now be paid . <p> Nigeria 's oil fields are all in the Delta . They are a source of wealth for others , but not for the people who live there . Public amenities in the Delta are virtually non-existent . In its more than 14,000 square miles there is only one road  --  from Port Harcourt to Warri in the western part of the Delta . A rail line runs north from Port Harcourt , but it is narrow gauge and single track , and left over from colonial days . Lord Lugard laid it out . ( In fact , all rail lines in Nigeria run north and south ; none go east and west . This also has to do with colonial days . ) No Nigerian government , either military or democratically elected , has ever done much for the impoverished Delta other than to appoint commissions to study its problems . <p> Meanwhile the joint venture partnerships that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation has entered into with oil companies  --  Shell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Italy 's Agip  --  have left little except pollution . Oil spills and leakage stain the ground ; the burning off of unwanted natural gas fouls the air , and turns night skies orange . Environmental groups like Greenpeace insist the oil companies are the principal villains in the Delta , and probably in all Nigeria . As always the environmentalists overstate things , although their complaints are heard in Congress . The House held hearings on Nigeria this summer , and by the time you read this the Senate may have held some more . <p> But Madeleine Albright is expected to visit Nigeria soon , and announce that Bill Clinton will drop in sometime next year . The White House expects black Americans to show their gratitude by voting for Democrats in the 2000 election . Warren Christopher , Albright 's predecessor , visited sub-Saharan Africa for the first time on the eve of the 1996 election . He announced U.S. support for an African peacekeeping force , and urged other African nations to bring pressure on the then military government of Nigeria to stop its human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as the French minister for foreign aid pointed out , mischievously but correctly , Christopher 's visit had everything to do with American politics and nothing at all to do with Africa . <p> Little has changed since then . Democratic National Committee priorities still drive U.S. policy . Nigeria , though , is one of the most complex , as well as the most populous country in Africa ; the U.N . estimates it has 120 million people . They are governed under a mixture of traditional law , legislated law , and law handed down by fiat , and they are divided by tribe . There is disagreement about the number of tribes , although 300 is as good a guess as any . Meanwhile the country is plagued by violence , and its economy is in shambles . The poor get by however they can , but even people with money may find life difficult . Phones do n't work , electric power fails , and potable water is a problem . But Nigeria also bursts with energy , and its great strength is the creativity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might help them , but Washington is in thrall to political correctness . Misplaced ideas about affirmative action , quotas , and diversity determine foreign policy . <p> When Olusegun Obasanjo was sworn in as Nigeria 's first democratically elected president last May after years of military rule , some 25 heads of state and other distinguished guests showed up in the capital , Abuja , for his inaugural . Britain sent Prince Charles , for example , and South Africa sent Nelson Mandela . The White House sent Jesse Jackson . Ten of the eleven members of the U.S. delegation , including Jackson , were black , and while the White House apparently thought that appropriate , Nigerians found it demeaning . As a Nigerian diplomat in Abuja wryly said later , " The Americans sent us their colored people . " He also recalled that at the inaugural Jesse Jackson wore a safari suit , and that at the formal state dinner a female delegate insisted on sitting at the place reserved for a prominent Nigerian politician , and then spent the evening glowering . He described her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , were her most distinctive feature . Apparently it was Texas Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee . <p> Meanwhile no one doubts Obasanjo would have won anyway , but even so the elections were marked by massive bribery and what Nigerians call " rigging . " Competent , honorable candidates committed to stable democracy  --  the new national assembly is even modeled after the U.S. Capitol  --  lost to rogues and tricksters . Nigeria is a cash-and-carry society , and the largest denomination is a 50-naira bill , equivalent to only about 50 cents . Bribery , however , can not be done on the cheap , and so politicians and their aides had to carry big plastic bags stuffed with naira all over Nigeria . The big plastic bags  --  red and white , or blue and white  --  were also much in evidence at the opening sessions of the new House and Senate . Decent committee assignments and leadership positions cost money , too . <p> Consequently the House elected as speaker a former computer salesman named Salisu Buhari , although the Nigerian constitution says a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was widely rumored he was younger . Buhari denied the rumors , however , and even took out newspaper ads to rebut them . He insisted he was 36 years old ; he also said he had a degree in business administration from the University of Toronto in Canada and a diploma in accounting from a university in Nigeria . That 's right , his colleagues in the majority Peoples Democratic Party said , and elected him speaker . <p> But soon afterwards a newspaper reported that no one at the University of Toronto had ever heard of Buhari , and that he had no diploma from the Nigerian university , either . Also , he was 29 , and not 36 . The evidence was irrefutable , but stonewalling often works well in Nigerian politics , and Buhari stuck with his story . He sued the newspaper for 500 million naira , and rallied his supporters . When he next showed up in the House , many members of his party rose to their feet and applauded . In a related episode a few days later , other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Manners were not what they should be , although perhaps they may improve . The United States Information Agency has sponsored talks on attracting more Nigerian women to politics . <p> Buhari said he would never resign , and that the " media speculation , " meaning the evidence , was part of a plot to destroy him . His subtext was that he was from the mostly Moslem north , and the newspaper was published in Lagos in the mostly Yoruba south . Playing the north-south card is also a tactic in Nigerian politics . In the end , though , it did Buhari no good . Obasanjo was promoting an anti-corruption bill for one thing , and for another the legislature had been embarrassed . After it was disclosed that House members would each get $26,000 to furnish their residences in Abuja , and each senator would get $37,000 , municipal workers demonstrated . Their minimum monthly wage was only $32 , and some of them had not been paid for months . Buhari was now looking particularly bad . He was forced to leave the House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , and not necessarily intractable , problem . The seething , unsettled Delta is more serious . History and the River Niger have created an area that makes the Balkans look like a model of homogeneity . The Niger rises in Guinea 2,600 miles away , and flows through West Africa until it joins with the Benue in Nigeria , and eventually disappears into the Delta 's rivers , swamps , and lagoons . Many tribes live there , and most of them despise one another , and have done so for a very long time . Linguists estimate that Ijo , one of the principal language groups in the Delta  --  there seem to be five or six  --  took some 7,000 years to develop . That means Ijo people roamed the Delta before the first Pyramid arose , or Britons learned to paint themselves blue . <p> Meanwhile waterways imperfectly divide the Delta into parcels , and each parcel may be home to a separate tribe , but who knows what is a tribe ? Presumably it is a group of people who all speak the same language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Inland Ijo , as well as Nembe-Akassa and Izon , which also are Ijo . Eastern Ijo comprises four or five dialects , and Nembe-Akassa two dialects , and Inland Ijo three . The dialects may not be mutually intelligible , and while opinions differ on how many dialects make up Izon , everyone agrees there are a great many . Serbs and Croats may insist otherwise , but they both understand Serbo-Croatian . Two tribes on opposite sides of a creek in the Delta might have to call in interpreters , or else talk in Pidgin English . <p> So the Delta is a land unto itself , and besides the different languages there are different social structures , customs , and religions . In some areas , twins are considered a misfortune and are eliminated at birth , but in others they are regarded as a special blessing . At the same time the Christian God has been hospitably received , and mingles with other deities . Ojukwu is also a supreme deity , but he may be thought of as the son of the supreme deity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trinity . The Mount of Fire and Miracles , Catholic Charismatics , and Assemblies of God stand in a row on a single street in Port Harcourt . The Foursquare Gospel , Eternal Sacred Order of Seraphim and Cherubin , and God 's Kingdom Society are around the corner . Spiritual comfort is everywhere , although in the Delta that no longer is enough . <p> " That was where he worked , " a school teacher was saying , while he pointed out an old sign  --  " Saro 's International "  --  in a building on Aggrey Road in Port Harcourt . " I remember the night before , thinking he would n't be executed , but the next morning he was dead . Ken was wrong in some things , but if it had n't been for him , no one would be paying attention . Ken woke everyone up . " <p> Ken was Ken Saro-Wiwa , and along with eight other Ogoni dissidents , he was hanged by the Sani Abacha government in 1995 after being convicted of inciting a riot that led to the murders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and depicted him as a victim of Shell Oil and a martyr to the ecological movement . It was , of course , never that simple  --  Saro-Wiwa threatened to lead the Delta into something like secession , and Shell had nothing to do with his death  --  but the protest campaign was effective : rallies in London , speeches in Washington , reports on television , and page-one stories in the New York Times . Attention was being paid to the Delta . <p> " The young people know about that , " the school teacher continued . " And you got guys who were in America , and are back now . They understand how things work . I do n't know . The young guys they 'll do something . I do n't know what . Something . " <p> So , something , but who knows where or what ? The nightmare is that if the Delta fell apart it could ignite a civil war , with north and south dividing , and fighting over the oil fields . Even as the school teacher , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Itsikeri , and Urhobo were in a three-way war in the western part of the Delta . There had just been a battle over a town called Kantu , and an unknown number of people had died . The month before there had been a battle at Warri , and as many as 200 had died . The Ijaw claimed Kantu was in traditional Ijaw territory . The Itsikeri said it was part of the Warri Kingdom , and under the rule of the Olu of Warri ; therefore it was Itsikeri . That same week , 25 Shell oil workers were kidnapped , presumably by the Ijaw , although the kidnappers were identified publicly only as " Delta youths . " The day after that , however , a group that called itself the Ijaw Youths Forum demanded $1 billion from the federal government and the oil companies . It also demanded , imaginatively , that the oil companies make improvements and do good works similar to those done on Bonny Island . <p> Bonny Island , an hour by speedboat from Port Harcourt , or the best part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southeast corner of the Delta and juts into the Gulf of Guinea . Its hereditary ruler is King Edward Asimini William Dappa Pepple , Perekule Xl , Amanyanabo of Grand Bonny Kingdom . Hippos share some of its beaches with salt-water crocodiles . Bonny is at once very old and very new , and it is also the site of a liquid gas plant . The plant is the world 's largest construction project , as well as an idea whose time has come , and ought to have come much sooner . It is also one of Nigeria 's best hopes for the future . <p> For years the Delta 's oil fields burned off their natural gas . For years , too , there were plans to build a liquid natural gas , or LNG , project . Usually they died of grandiosity . International bankers told Nigeria it was " under-borrowed . " Successive Nigerian governments were happy to believe them . For a while it was thought the LNG plant should be an $8-billion project . In 1995 , however , everything finally came together . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian  --  put up $3 billion . Kellog Brown &; Root of Houston , which was the American part of the consortium , was also to be in charge of the construction . Bill Clinton , responding to pressure from the Congressional Black Caucus and its almost perfect record of being wrong on anything to do with Nigeria , threatened to block American participation , but fortunately then he relented . <p> So Kellog Brown &; Root went ahead . First it built a village with brick houses for the Bonny Islanders who had lived in mud huts in a village called Finima . Then it leveled Finima , and in its place built barracks and other accommodations for 20,000 workers . Then it brought in the workers . Natural gas now reaches the plant from some 125 miles of underground pipelines . Then it is put through a heat-exchange machine that weighs almost 300 tons and looks like a space-age silo . The gas goes up hot and comes down cold , and then is stored in gigantic concrete tanks . Finally it is loaded on ships , and carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary project , start to finish in only three years , was also an exercise in community relations . Among other things , the LNG people built a school , repaired roads , donated a boat to the police ( piracy is an old problem in the Delta ) , renovated public buildings , immunized and dewormed children , built a public jetty , and conducted an AIDS and TB campaign . They also contributed to local charities , and gave the King a customized four-wheel- drive land cruiser . The Ijaw youths now want the oil companies to do the same . <p> However ... <p> The Bonny Chiefs Council , which rules Bonny Island along with the King , now says the LNG people have not done enough , and that unless they do more they may encounter the same tactics of sabotage and kidnapping practiced by the Ijaws . Meanwhile the LNG people say they can build a road in the Delta  --  remember there is only the one road now  --  but the Ogonis have filed an environmental impact request to stop it . The fear now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So the Delta is still seething , and as the Delta goes so will Nigeria , and as Nigeria goes , so will a large part of Africa . Meanwhile the administration has just opened the Office of Transition Initiatives in Port Harcourt , and announced that one of its first programs will be the " empowerment " of women . <p> ILLUSTRATION ( COLOR ) <p> By John Corry <p> <p> John Corry is The American Spectator 's senior correspondent <p> <p>
