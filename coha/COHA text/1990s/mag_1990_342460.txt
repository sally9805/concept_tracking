Among dread diseases , from multiple sclerosis and cancer to Alzheimer 's and AIDS , diabetes might appear to be one of the least threatening . If not quite perceived as conquered , it is widely viewed as a manageable , albeit serious , affliction . People with diabetes talk about living with their illness , not dying from it . To prove the point , they resolutely lead active and productive lives . Later , however , many will discover that this insidious disease has mocked their efforts to control it . Like a dormant volcano , diabetes can feign slumber for many years , only to erupt with sudden savagery . <P> Consider the case of Arthur Hettler III , a once energetic high school principal from San Antonio . At first Hettler thought he had just a mild case of diabetes . He required no medication to control the excess blood sugar caused by the disease ; instead , he watched his diet as carefully as he could . Then , two summers ago , Hettler strolled barefoot across some sun-scorched pavement and blistered his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to heal . A few months later the foot was so badly infected that it had to be amputated . Shortly before Christmas , Hettler , 47 , suffered a paralyzing stroke . The infection and the stroke were complications resulting directly from the slow progression of diabetes . " The disease , " observes Hettler , " can really creep up on you . " <P> And it has crept up on an estimated 100 million people worldwide , among them actress Mary Tyler Moore , jazz musician Dizzy Gillespie and singer Ella Fitzgerald . Because the initial symptoms ( fatigue , frequent urination ) are usually mild , half the 12 million Americans with diabetes do not realize they have it . Even after diagnosis , many patients fail to take diabetes as seriously as they should . " At first , everything goes along fine , " sighs June Howe , a patient at Boston 's Joslin Diabetes Center . " You do n't realize that later on problems will set in . " <P> That is an understatement . Diabetes more than doubles the risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading cause of blindness in adults and accounts for a third of all cases of kidney failure . Only traumatic injuries are responsible for more amputations . Altogether , the complications have made diabetes the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S. <P> Fortunately , as awareness grows that diabetes is a major killer , some discoveries in the field are giving new hope to its victims . Scientists are beginning to understand what causes diabetes and how to slow its progress . In fact , researchers are increasingly optimistic about developing drug treatments that may stop the affliction cold in many cases .
