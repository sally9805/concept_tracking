As 1993 groans , exhausted , to a halt , it 's time for me to dust off my superlatives and report on the optical opulence that is newly ours . It 's a fact that new products are appearing at a much faster rate than in years past . This is because the computer has drastically reduced the development time required for designing optical instruments . According to Dr. Bill Cross of Bausch &; Lomb : " Computers have made designing new lens systems five to ten times faster than when people did it unassisted ; in some cases , they 've let us develop lens systems that would have been too complicated to even attempt without computer help . Computers eliminate all the human error that used to occur in design , and the best thing is , if a computer has to run all night to make a calculation , you let it run . You do n't care  --  you 've gone home . " But enough euphoria ; let 's get down to glass tacks . For years , fans of Leupold had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope , and three years ago , the racket grew intolerable , so Leupold began designing one . They wanted something that was , above all , light , which most variable spotters are definitely not . What they came up with is a 60mm 12X-40X with a cast-magnesium body , rubber armor , and an unusual stacked-barrel shape that " folds " light rays rather than reflects them through a prism . It weighs only 32 ounces , which is nearly a pound less than comparable scopes . By eliminating the prism , Leupold was able to get significantly better light transmission , long eye relief , and high resolution , particularly at top magnification where most variable spotting scopes lose significant amounts of it . I 've been using a prototype since December of 1992 , and I 've used production-line versions , and this scope does everything Leupold claims for it . The list price is $883.90 , but in real life it will probably sell for $600 . Leupold 's second item of note is a new quick-detachable scope-ring/base system that is the bee 's knees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were either heavy , or expensive , or unreliable , or they placed the scope too high over the bore , or all of the preceding . Leupold 's Quick Release Bases do away with all these problems . How ? Permit me to quote from the Leupold Reference Guide : " The ring is of standard configuration with a straight post that inserts into a hole in the base . The ring is then locked in by a cam that is tightened down by rotating a lever forward .... By moving the lever forward , the rear of the ring post forms an interference fit with the contour of the base in the hole .... " To remove the scope , you rotate the levers a half-turn rearward and lift the scope off the rifle ; to replace the scope , you fit the ring posts into the bases and rotate the levers a half-turn forward . You do n't have to turn the levers hard , because recoil automatically seats the rings tightly in the bases . The price is $60 and a bit for the whole package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A-Square rifle , and found that they worked flawlessly . I could consistently remove and replace the scope and get it within 1/2 inch of where it was originally zeroed . If you feel the need for a quick-detach system , this is the way to go . I hang around with Contributing Editor John Barsness a lot , and one of the reasons I do so is that he , too , is an optics freak . Last June we were moping on his porch watching the sleet fall ( this was in Montana ) when the question arose : Are there any really good , moderately priced binoculars ? What we were looking for were glasses that would be nearly indistinguishable in quality from top-line models ( unless you had eyes like a bataleur eagle and a degree in optical engineering ) , but would cost half or less than half as much . The answer is yes . My nominee is the Leupold 9x35 Individual Focus Porro Prism , which sells for a suggested list price of $401.80 . It is a smallish full-sized binocular that is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality . It is rubber-armored and has a strap of sublime simplicity . John 's binocular of choice was the Bausch &; Lomb Custom 8x36 center-focus . This too is a porro prism glass , and it sells for $370 . It is not rubber-armored , but that is the only criticism I can make of it . This B &L; is about as good a glass as you are going to need in this world , and should proof be needed , you will note that it 's marked with the Audubon Society 's seal of approval . ( If you think hunters are fussy about binoculars , you should talk to birdwatchers . In fact , a lot of hunters I know are birders , so this glass will make them doubly happy . ) However , if you have a higher level of discretionary income , here are two instruments that are worth breaking the bank for . The first is the Swarovski 7x42 WB SLC ( which also comes in a 10X version ) . This is a new design ; it is larger , heavier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior , which places it among the finest binoculars in the world . The WB SLC is , like all Swarovski roof-prism glasses , extremely tough , waterproof , and equipped with snap-on caps for the front and rear lenses . At 31.3 ounces it is fairly heavy and , at $950 , expensive . Is it heavy enough to bother anyone ? No . Is it worth its price ? In spades . Do I recommend the WB SLC ? Oh my , yes . Before the reunification of Germany , there were two Carl Zeiss factories . The one in East Germany was in the city of Jena , and after the border was erased , the West German firm bought out the Eastern one . However , some of the Jena factory 's glasses went to a U.S. import firm called Deutsche Optik , and they sent me a 12x50 porro prism binocular called the Nobilem to examine . The obvious question here is , what 's the use of a 12X binocular ? " T is as follows : I 've found that for hunting , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope . You can see more of the country because your field of view is much wider . You can see somewhat better because you are using both eyes and have a stereoscopic image ; and you can watch for longer periods , because you do n't have to squint one eye shut . I 've found that while I ca n't hand-hold a 15X binocular , I can hand-hold the 12X Nobilem if I sit down . If you lack my superlative nervous system , you can get a tripod adapter for it from the importer . The Nobilem weighs a shade over 41 ounces , is mechanically good and optically superb , comes with a leather neck strap that is too long , and arrives in a leather hard case that is an object of great beauty . You can get the Nobilem pebble-finished or rubber-armored , and I strongly recommend the latter . The price for the former , with case , is $749 ; the armored version , which is caseless , is $50 more . For more information , contact the importer : Deutsche Optik/SCM Corp. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diego , Calif. 92167 , telephone ( 800 ) 225-0407 . ( And a note : The original warranty is void because the original factory no longer exists as such , but the importer has repair facilities , and offers its own warranty . ) Riflescopes . I 'm firmly convinced that the rapid and drastic improvements in scope optics coincided with the entry of Nikon into the market . They can grind glass to a fare-thee-well . The Nikon scope that I tried out is a fairly specialized one  --  a 4X-12X X 40mm variable with an adjustable objective to eliminate parallax at all distances from 50 yards to 1,000 yards . ( Parallax  --  the appearance of the image in other than its true location  --  results from a scope being imperfectly focused for a given range . Most hunting scopes are focused for 150 yards or so and have very slight degrees of parallax at all other ranges ; too slight to make a difference except when shots are taken at very long distances , or at very small targets , or both . Scopes with focusing objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely . ) Scopes of this power range are not new ; I experimented with them in the early 1970s , but was never happy with them because as you increased the magnification , you decreased resolution . Such is not the case with this Nikon ; it is sharp as a scalpel all the way from 4X , which qualifies it for general hunting , to 12X , which is dandy for varmints , antelope , whitetail deer across beanfields , and targets . There is also a 4X-12X with a 50mm objective , but I like this one better because you can mount it low , and while not as bright as the 50mm , it is still plenty bright . It comes in matte or glossy finish , and lists for $563 . Schmidt &; Bender is a small German firm that makes , in very limited numbers , what are arguably the finest scopes in the world . S &B; insists on using an enamel finish , which is less durable than anodizing , but otherwise produces instruments of heartrending wonderfulness . S &B; scopes are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be heavy , the reticles look strange to our eyes , and the prices can cause the unprepared to swoon . There is , however , a Schmidt &; Bender scope that overcomes all these cultural barriers ; it 's the 4x36 fixed-power ( catalog number 932681 ) with a Duplex-type reticle . It weighs just over 14 ounces , which is heavy for a 4X , but not objectionable , and a price of $624 ( which is a lot of money for a 4X scope , but on the other hand , if you can find something demonstrably better , I will let you hit me over the head with it ) . Since Schmidt &; Bender scopes are hard to find , I invite you to call the importer , Dietrich Apel , Schmidt &; Bender , Inc. , Dept . FS , P.O. Box 134 , Brook Road , Meriden , N.H. 03770 , telephone ( 800 ) 468-3450 or ( 603 ) 469-3565 . In 1987 , Bausch &; Lomb introduced a limited-production binocular called the Elite , which sold for the then-unheard-of price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best instrument they could , charge accordingly , and hope that they did n't lose too much money on the project . Despite the price , the Elite sold in such numbers that B &L; made it a regular production item . Since then , the name has been extended to two B &L; spotting scopes , and now , two new series of riflescopes , the 3000 and the 4000 . The 3000 series is lower-priced and consist of three variable models  --  a 3X-9X , 4X-12X , and a 2X-7X , each in a couple of variations ; the 4000 line is comprise of 6X-24X , 2.5X-10X , and 1.5X-6X variables and a 10X target scope with a 30mm tube . In designing the 3000 series , Bausch &; Lomb was looking for a high-quality scope that was affordable to most shooters . Since this line sells for $280 to $360 , I 'd say B &L; was on target . The 4000 series is , in the words of a B &L; spokesman , " ... over-engineered . We did things that probably were n't necessary , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The prices for this series run from $480 to $1,390 ( for the 10X 30mm scope ) . Since the 4000 series is what B &L; went all out on , I chose to test one of them  --  a 2.5X-10X . It is such a good scope that I have difficulty keeping my composure writing about it . I showed the Elite to two friends who are very experienced shooters , and know exactly what they 're looking at . Both men glanced through it , did a double-take looked again , and smiled , disbelieving , at the eye-popping splendor of its optics . I 've never seen that retention before . How good is it mechanically put it on a .340 Weatherby , took it to the range , and found that it is as good as anything I have used . Perhaps the most gratifying part of all this is the price of the Elite 4000  --  the suggested retail for the 2.5X-10X matte finish is $588 , which is actually less than some competitive scopes of the same range . If B &L; had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering what you get ... but they did n't , so you should rush right out and buy two . For last , I 've saved the Big Kahuna , the Old Sockdolager itself  --  the Leica 7x42 Geovid binocular . This instrument is special on several accounts : its size , its weight ( 56.5 ounces ) , and its suggested retail price ( $6,000 , although you can buy one for a piddling $4,500 ) . What causes the Geovid to be so large and so costly is the fact that within its massive body lies the circuitry for an infrared LED-display rangefinder , and an LED compass . Originally designed for the military , the Geovid measures range in meters  --  I said meters , Son , not yards  --  from 25 out to over 1,000 . It also shows you your compass heading in degrees . All this is done via one button on the left lens barrel and one on the right . Push either button once and you see a small red square in your field of view . Point the square at whatever you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push the button a second time . The range or bearing pops up instantly , and can be read even in the brightest sunlight . Leica claims that the rangefinder is accurate to within a meter ( which is a yard and a tenth ) and I have found it to be so . The Geovid is altogether a marvelous device , and if you can afford one , you will not be disappointed . And on that note , I wish you all a Merry Christmas , and a New Year free from coma , astigmatism , and spherical distortion . <p>
