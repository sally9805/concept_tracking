It was too disturbing to ignore . HIGH MURDER RATE FOR WOMEN ON JOB : 40% OF WOMEN KILLED AT WORK ARE MURDERED read a headline in the October 3 edition of the New York Times . It is a figure increasingly bandied about by Department of Labor officials , politicians , and violent-crime experts . But the often cited fact raises more questions than it answers . Just how many women are murdered at work ? Why are they killed while on the job ? And is there anything gender-specific about workplace homicides ? Two recent federal government reports reveal that murder is the leading cause of on-the-job death among women . A Bureau of Labor Statistics yearlong study released in October , the one cited by the New York Times , was echoed a month later by a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) report based on a decade 's worth of data . Both investigations uncovered similarly worrisome findings : in the U.S. every year , between 150 and 180 women are murdered at work . That 's an average of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statisticians were appalled . " It 's staggering , " says Lynn Jenkins , who coauthored the NIOSH study . It 's also only part of the workplace murder story . The numbers of women killed at work are small when compared to male homicides on the job . The recent government studies show work-site homicide rates for men are more than three times those for women . But like all statistics , say researchers , those numbers have to be considered in context . For instance , men are overwhelmingly employed in the professions most at risk for homicide , working as law enforcement officers , security guards , and taxi drivers . It may well be the very fact that women have traditionally had low job death rates , whether from murder , injury , or accident , that the latest tally of women killed at work has received such attention  --  sparking calls for action and promises of further scrutiny . " It 's so important that this got brought up , " says Karen Nussbaum , director of the Department of Labor 's Women 's Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workplace problem , as a hazard of going to work and being a woman . " Workplace consultants say that many women used to consider the offices , factories , and businesses where they work safe havens , a shield against the twin dangers of random street violence and domestic abuse . While the workplace is not as dangerous an environment as a public place or a woman 's home , neither is it as violence-free a zone as women have assumed . " There is no longer a sanctity in the workplace . That notion has been challenged , " says Dennis Johnson , president of Behavior Analysts &; Consultants , Inc. , a Florida-based firm that advises corporations on how to prevent violence in the workplace . " The violence that is throughout our society has been superimposed on the corporate landscape . " To date , scant research exists to explain why women are being killed at work in record numbers . Death certificates , which are used to gather statistics for on-the-job fatalities , include very few details on the victim 's background or on the motivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultants say anecdotal evidence provides some possible answers . One cause of murder on the job for women represents a new twist on an old theme : the disgruntled employee angry at and intent on doing in the boss . The modern-day version of this scenario includes male employees who are especially miffed when a female colleague is a superior , has a role in hiring and firing , or is promoted ahead of them . As noted in " Breaking Point , " a September 1993 report on workplace violence that Johnson coauthored : " Some men may resent women who are promoted to supervisory positions , especially men who believe that they , not the women , deserved the promotion . " Monitors of workplace violence say that these kinds of killings are becoming increasingly common . " In the era of downsizing , restructuring , mergers , and takeovers , there has been a lack of replacement jobs , " says Johnson , adding that as women continue to chip away at the glass ceiling , men tend to become resentful if they 're replaced by women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The male externalizes the blame . There is still a significant sense of entitlement by males in certain positions . " As examples , Johnson cites two incidents that occurred within a week of each other in late 1991 . In one case , a supervisor with the Social Security Administration was shot and killed by a former employee who had worked for her . In the other , a man who had been fired from a manicure salon returned to his former workplace and murdered the boss . He also wounded the woman 's husband and brother before killing himself . In these gender-based incidents , often the intended victim is n't the only one who gets hurt . Some high-profile workplace murder cases involved coworkers who accidentally got caught in the line of fire . Two such incidents recently occurred in U.S. post offices , which have a history of workplace massacres . On May 6 last year , Larry Jasion , a disgruntled Dearborn , Michigan , postal employee set out to kill a female coworker . He did shoot and critically injure his intended victim , Sandra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one colleague and injured another . Jasion was angry , according to a postal service spokesperson , because Brandstatter had been promoted ahead of him . In Opportunity Commission . His claim had been rejected about six weeks prior to the shooting . And on the same May day in southern California , Mark Hilbun , who had been dismissed from his job at the Dana Point Post Office for harassing coworker Kim Springer , returned to his former workplace allegedly to kill her . But Springer managed to escape , and Hilbun instead killed a letter carrier and wounded a clerk . Hilbun did not act on impulse . He had constantly harassed Springer and written a series of violent and sexually explicit notes to her . His final letter read : " I love you . I 'm going to kill us both and take us both to hell . " Experts contend that potentially violent employees , such as Hilbun , almost always give warning signals of their intentions . Postal worker Sandra Brandstatter wrote a letter to her managers several weeks before Jasion embarked on the shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her safety and singled out Mr. Jasion , " said Marvin Runyon , Postmaster General , at a press conference the day after the crime . Runyon said that at the time Jasion was promptly interviewed by management officials who determined the postal worker was " lucid , rational , and did not pose a threat . " Nevertheless , Runyon insisted , " We treat all threats of workplace violence seriously . " Frequently , managers fail to take such threats seriously . And in situations where the perpetrator is known to the woman worker , some supervisors are quick to dismiss the threat as a personal problem . Norman Shockley , senior vice president for Crisis Management International , Inc. , an Atlanta consulting firm that specializes in traumatic stress in the corporate sector , can recall several such cases . Shockley says that during a recent workday he received two almost identical calls from women who are human-resource managers for large corporations . In each case , the woman was threatened repeatedly with violence by a male former coworker who had been fired . " The one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The woman explained to Shockley that she went to her supervisor , who laughed at her and said , " That will never happen here . Go back to work . " Shockley finds such reactions reprehensible : " The supervisor was in what we call corporate denial . The woman had no support from management . I think that 's horrible . " In another disturbing trend , women are victims of domestic violence that spills into the workplace . Take the December 1992 murder of Camille Bailey by her ex-boyfriend , Thomas Jeffrey Cox . A 21-year-old city of Milwaukee employee , Bailey was fatally shot in the chest and neck by Cox at the office where she worked . Later , it became apparent that Cox was furious with Bailey for breaking off their relationship because of his violent behavior . According to court documents , when asked why he attacked his former girlfriend , Cox said : " The bitch deserved it . " A sizable chunk of workplace murders of women are related to armed robbery attempts . Women are often employed in high-risk workplaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of choice for gun-wielding assailants who view women as soft targets . " Because of the stratification of the economy , many women are relegated to low-wage service or clerical jobs , " according to the " Breaking Point " report . " Many of these jobs place women on the front lines , where workplace security measures are inadequate or nonexistent . " Others looking at the problem confirm that assessment . Jennifer Weber , a consultant to the Women 's Caucus of the California State Legislature , which held hearings last June on violence against female workers , says bluntly : " Because women are disproportionately in jobs like receptionists they are the first line of defense when in a violent situation . " That proved true for Bo Hua Cha . A 50-year-old mother of four , Cha was shot to death last September as she stood behind the counter of her Washington , D.C. , dry cleaning store . Cha , a Korean American immigrant who had worked long hours in several menial jobs to put her daughters through college , was alone in her shop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was often on her own because her husband also worked somewhere else , and they were trying to save on costs , " says Kris Oh , an attorney familiar with the case . " The perpetrator took advantage of that . She appeared vulnerable . " Just two weeks before , and about a mile away , another woman who ran a convenience store was killed while working late at night . Interestingly , few women 's groups contacted by Ms. have been tracking workplace murders of women . Some feminists suggest that women 's groups can be reluctant to address a problem that affects men as well as women . Ellen Bravo , executive director of 9to5 , National Association of Working Women , believes such an approach is shortsighted : " I would hope that as we see more and more of this trend in the workplace . . . we would all work together on this .
