Raisa Gorbachev has not been seen in public since Aug. 22 , when , looking haggard and pale , she walked down the steps of the plane that carried her and her family back to Moscow after 72 hours of house arrest in the Crimea . But last week the world did get a chance to read what the 59-year-old wife of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev had to say about her ordeal and , in a newly released memoir , about her earlier foreboding of what lay ahead . <P> In her first postcoup interview , Raisa told the Soviet trade-union newspaper Trud she was so terrified that the plotters would kill her and her family that she suffered speech problems and an " acute bout of hypertension " for which she is still being treated . " Those days were horrible , " she said . <P> She first learned of the putsch at about 5 p.m. on Sunday , Aug. 18 , when an agitated Gorbachev told her that a group of men had arrived from Moscow to see him and that all the phone lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ links the President to the Minister of Defense . The whole family quickly agreed they would stick by the President at all costs . " This was a very serious decision , " Raisa told Trud . " We know our history . " This may have been a reference to the Bolsheviks ' grisly execution of the last Russian Czar , Nicholas II , and his family . <P> During the attempted coup , the Gorbachevs took frequent walks outside the dacha so that they could talk without fear of being bugged . By showing themselves , they also hoped to disprove the plotters ' assertion that the President was ill . <P> Raisa told Trud , " I never thought such a thing ( ( as the coup ) ) could happen to us . " But in her autobiography , I Hope ( HarperCollins ; $20 ) , completed four months before the failed putsch , the Soviet First Lady says she has long been anxious about the " fierce struggle now going on between loyalty and treachery " in the Soviet Union . In the book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raisa discloses for the first time that her grandfather was executed under Stalin , an experience that made her both fearful and contemptuous of apparatchiks who act one way " when it is to their advantage " and another when it is not . " Sometimes I feel that they are not faces but masks , " she says . " And the masks will suddenly disappear and I can see quite clearly the faces of the people who informed on my grandfather . " <P> Gorbachev anticipated the threat from communist hard-liners as early as August 1990 , during a vacation in Yalta . It was then , Raisa recalls , that her husband told her , " We 've got the most difficult time ahead of us . There is going to be political fighting . . . it 's very alarming . . . ( ( But ) ) we must n't give in to the conservatives . . . We must n't surrender the fate of the country to cowboys . They would ruin everything . " $ <P> In I Hope , Raisa describes her early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Siberia . Money was so tight that she did not own a real overcoat until she went to college . " Everybody remembers the coat , " she says . " It really was a milestone in the family history . "
