What I remember about Peru is : flying in a plane over the Andes and fainting ; stealing a statue of the baby Jesus ; and threatening to eat a dog turd . <p> What everyone else remembers about Peru is why we went there in the first place . <p> My mother and I went to Lima , Peru , to wait until the end of the war . From Europe , it was a long way to go just to wait . A journey of several weeks-first by car , then by boat , then by plane . By the end of it , I was tired , I was sick , I pushed away my mother 's hand and did not listen to her when , in between gasps into her oxygen mask , she said : " If you do n't breathe into your mask , you 'll faint . " She held up mine to my mouth , but a few minutes earlier I had thrown up . I was afraid I would do it again . I held my breath for as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I went to breathe again , nothing happened . <p> One of the stewards had to revive me . He gave me mouth-tomouth on the aisle floor while the other passengers stared and my mother cried . <p> Afterwards , when the plane was flying at a lower altitude , the pilot walked up to my mother . <p> " Is the little girl okay ? " <p> " Yes , she 's fine now . She frightened me , " my mother answered <p> My mother told him . <p> " Where are getting folks from ? " <p> My mother nodded . In her relief , she told him where . <p> " How long will you 're getting ? " Before my mother off in Lima ? " <p> My mother nodded . In her relief , she told him where . <p> " How long will you be staying ? " Before my mother could answer , he must have remembered the war . " It 'll be over soon , " he said . " Is this your first trip to Peru ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pilot belonged back in the cockpit . He had perched himself on my mother 's armrest , he was talking to her as if he had all day . He took out a pad , he wrote addresses down . I squirmed in my seat . When at last he got up to leave , he patted my mother on the arm , he winked at me . <p> " I 'll be seeing you , " he told both of us , " and do n't frighten your mother again . " <p> " See , " my mother said , her face was flushed , she looked pretty . " Next time we fly , you 'll wear your oxygen mask . " The American pilot was wrong-the war was not over soon . In Lima , my mother rented a small house . The house was one story and shaped like the letter U. In the middle there was a courtyard with banana trees . I was very excited about the banana trees-I could pick and eat as many bananas as I liked . If she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fry them for me . I ate bananas until I got sick from them and left them to rot and attract flies . <p> Beyond the courtyard there was a garden of sorts , but the maid , Margarita , said the garden was full of snakes and my mother said that I should not believe everything Margarita said , but that we also could not afford both a cook and a gardener-to say nothing of Margarita . Instead , my mother planted red geraniums in pots , the rest she left wild . It was too hot , she said , and who knew how long we would stay . Any day now , we might leave , leave Lima and go back . <p> Back to where ? <p> My father was from Berlin , and long before I learned that his house , the entire street on which he and my mother had lived , was rubble , I knew we would not go back there . Also , I knew we would not stay in Lima . Lima was temporary . Lima was in between two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not imagine . Lima was limbo . <p> The pilot 's name was Jerry . When he was not flying his plane , he was flying through the air into the country club pool . He did jackknifes . The Peruvian waiters , trays in hand , would stop to watch him . He was not showing off . Once , I heard Jerry ask my mother if she wanted to fly with him . She could sit in the cockpit . After glancing over in my direction , my mother shook her head . Then , adjusting the straps to her two-piece bathing suit , she stood up and dove into the pool . Her bathing suit was red and white stripes . " Miss America ! " Jerry called out after her . At the last minute , just before hitting the water , my mother 's pointed feet crossed-like Jesus ' s on the cross . <p> I knew what they looked like . <p> Every day on my way home from school , I went to Mass with the maid and I prayed to Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe , that the war would end , that I could dive like Jerry , or own a bathing suit like my mother 's . I remember that if I made a mistake in the wording or in the order of prayer , I started all over again . Also , I crossed myself all the time . It was more than a habit , it was a tic . I crossed myself when I crossed the street , when someone dropped a dish , when a dog barked , so much so that my mother asked me to stop . " It 's meaningless , " she told me . " You 're not a Catholic . " Since she did not say what I was , I continued to cross myself behind her back . <p> I wanted to outdo the maid . <p> Side by side , on our knees , it was like an endurance test : who could pray the longest , the hardest , without once looking up or at each other . Not much taller than I , Margarita had a flat Inca face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and callused , I guessed she had more to pray for than I did . In church I copied her , at home I bullied her . Later , when she discovered the marble Jesus in my room , I bit her . My mother sided with Margarita . I had drawn blood and her hand became infected . " Why did you do it ? " My mother asked me in French . I would not answer her . She asked me in English , then in Spanish : " Porque la mordio ? " I shook my head , I felt like crying . " You must apologize to Margarita . " I refused . Margarita , red-eyed , and with an elaborate bandage on her hand , avoided me . I heard her tell the cook in the kitchen that I was just like a dog . The cook laughed . <p> We rarely mentioned my father . I waited for my mother to bring up his name . He was more hers than mine . Whenever she received a letter from him , she read the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those letters . The letters were written in French ( although German , my father had enlisted as a French soldier , a legionnaire , and under the circumstances , it would have been inadmissible for him to write my mother in his native tongue ) . My father 's French was scanty , I pictured him with a dictionary in one hand , a pen in the other , and how did he sign the letters ? Je t'aime or Je t'embrasseendearments so unfamiliar as to be meaningless . Jerry must have been a relief . He talked to my mother about golf scores , canasta scores , not scores of dead . <p> My mother was twenty-eight , I was seven . At the time , I had no idea she was so young . <p> Jerry was older . Thirty-five , forty ? His children , a boy and a girl , were teenagers , and at the pool , I watched them . Judy wore lipstick and painted her toenails red . Both she and her brother , Jerry junior , had adopted the arrogance and petulance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ordered cokes in a fluent colloquial Spanish that proclaimed their intimacy with the country , but not their attachment to it . A few feet away , their mother sat in the shade of an umbrella . She was either allergic to the sun or bored by it . When Jerry did his splendid jackknifes not one of them looked up . " Come on , Jerry , I 'll race you , " he called to his son from the water . <p> " Nah . Too hot . I 'm tired . " <p> I looked at my mother . She was reading a book , or pretending to read . <p> I will ! I wished I could answer Jerry . I wanted to know what it was like to be with him . <p> When he sat drying himself in the sun with a towel around his neck , not looking at my mother or at anyone , I wanted to reach out and touch the blond hairs on his legs . My father always wore suits . " I 'm worried about her , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her time indoors , in church , with the maid . " <p> " Make her take swimming lessons . " <p> It was a Saturday afternoon , my mother was playing canasta in the club with Jerry , his wife , and someone else . <p> " Can I shuffle the cards ? " The hottest and stillest part of the day , I prowled aimlessly stirring up the warm air and American cigarette smoke . <p> " Can I cut the deck ? " I liked to do that , which exasperated my mother . <p> " Okay . Just once . " She frowned while the others fell silent . <p> My hands were sticky , I spilt some of the cards on the floor . <p> Crossing myself , I bent down to pick them up . <p> Next to Margarita 's and my church , there was a store that sold religious artifacts . Margarita was friendly with the salesgirl ; often after school , we went in there . While they were busy talking , I browsed in the store , I inspected the statues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virgin Mary was the prettiest , the kindest looking , had the nicest clothes . If I was careful , I could touch and no one said not to . I do n't know when exactly I first noticed the baby Jesus . His flesh was Carrara marble pink , His loincloth and eyes were painted the same aquamarine blue . He was beautiful . Precious too , He was lying inside a glass case on a piece of velvet . I wanted Him right away , but each time I approached the case with Him in it , the salesgirl broke off her conversation with Margarita . She told me not to touch the glass , my hands were dirty . Before I did , she must have known what I was going to do . <p> I could take the money from my mother 's purse , but the salesgirl would ask where I got the money and tell Margarita , who knew I had no money . I could save someone 's life , another child 's , at the risk of my own , and claim the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could get sick myself and nearly die . My prayers grew longer . I vowed never to ask for anything again . Obsessed , I readied my room for the baby Jesus . I concocted a shrine for him-a tiny bed of cotton wool . I festooned it with beads , I lopped off the heads of my mother 's geraniums <p> In a few months , I had learned how to swim well enough to start to dive . Jerry took an interest in me . <p> " Put your chin on your chest , " he advised . " Do n't look up or you 'll do a belly flop . " Sometimes , he would put his hand on my stomach to steady me at the pool 's edge , then , gently , push me in . It was the only time Judy or Jerry junior looked up . Smack ! I belly-flopped . <p> Jerry laughed , shook his crew-cut head . " Almost . Did n't I tell you to keep your chin down ? " <p> I tried again . I was indefatigable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , skinny , and that I could not dive . Jerry 's attention was like a blessing , his hand on my stomach bestowed more than equality . Over and over , I belly-flopped happily into the Lima pool . <p> One day , Jerry produced a dollar bill . I had never seen one before . " It 's worth a lot of soles , " he told me . " See if you can keep it under your chin . " The dollar bill floated up in the water , but it gave me an idea . I would ask Jerry to buy the baby Jesus . I would tell him that it was a present for my mother-she had admired Him in the store . <p> I waited for him outside the men 's locker room while he changed into his golf clothes . The first time , Jerry came out with his foursome . The men were carrying heavy bags of clubs and laughing . Jerry did not see me . The second time , the men 's locker-room attendant came out before Jerry did and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shrugged my shoulders and did not answer , he said a bad word . I was tempted to wait for Jerry in the middle of the fairway , but I did not dare . Children were forbidden there . <p> I was almost ready to give up when the cook rushed me through breakfast one morning . <p> " Your mother is giving a party , " Margarita explained . " She has a lot of cooking to do . " <p> I thought the party was for my father . The war was over and he was coming to Lima . <p> " If people ask you over to their houses , you have to pay them back , " my mother explained . We were in the courtyard where the guests would sit before dinner , she was tidying up . " Wear your yellow dress tonight . What 's happened to all the geraniums ? There are n't any flowers . " <p> My mother had lit candles in the courtyard and geraniums or no , it looked festive . She looked beautiful in a white dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair was swept up from her face and held up by a sparkling comb . To me , the stones in the comb looked like diamonds . From time to time , she touched them . Her arms were bare and brown . <p> " You know Ellie . " My mother smiled and prodded the stiff yellow cotton on my back . <p> I was looking for Jerry . More familiar to me by the pool or playing cards , in our house , my mother 's guests looked like strangers . <p> " How 's the future champion diver ? " Dressed in a dark suit , Jerry looked formal , forbidding . I almost did not recognize him . The dining room was directly across from my bedroom and Margarita was serving . She was frightened of making a mistake and angering either my mother or the cook . The cook had taken a lot of trouble , for days she would complain about it . Kneeling in front of my shrine , I could hear the clinking of china and glasses , the voices and laughter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dining room by himself . <p> I must have shut my eyes , I must have fallen asleep where I was . When I opened my eyes again , I heard someone crying . My mother was standing alone in the courtyard , her back to me . Her shoulders were shaking , her hair had come undone . It was late . All the candles in the courtyard had burned out , the guests had gone home , the cook and Margarita were in bed already . <p> The next day , my mother searched for her diamond comb . I was determined to find it for her . On my hands and knees , I looked in the courtyard . Still on my hands and knees , I went to look for the comb in the wild part of the garden where the snakes were . This was where I found the dog turd . I picked it up to show Margarita . A sausage , I said . A neighbor 's dog , a dirty dog , I was wicked to touch it , Margarita , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would punish me . <p>
