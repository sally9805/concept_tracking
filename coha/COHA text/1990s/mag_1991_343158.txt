THE PROMISED LAND <P> by Nicholas Lemann <P> Knopf ; 410 pages ; $24.95 <P> There were two great migrations that transformed America in this century . The first brought millions of arrivals through the gates of Ellis Island . The second , which began in the 1940s , saw more than 5 million blacks move from the farms and small towns of the South to the cities of the North . Because it took place entirely within U.S. borders , that second massive relocation slipped by with less notice than the first , until the nation woke to find itself transformed . By the time their numbers had tapered off , around 1970 , many of the travelers were embarked upon another journey  --  up the ladder of class advancement . But almost as many were rattling in the dungeons of the underclass , causing reverberations throughout American life . <P> Nicholas Lemann , a national correspondent for the Atlantic , tries to fathom the course of that great surge by linking the personal experiences of a few migrants to a tale of big-city politicking in Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story within an account of how three successive White House administrations , from Kennedy through Nixon , were consumed by a debate over federal antipoverty efforts  --  a Washington policy war that combined the worst features of academic detachment and fang-baring political ambition . His heroes are the migrants who managed to clamber into the middle class , mostly on the narrow foothold of modest government jobs . His villains  --  and there are more of those  --  are the politicians and policymakers of both left and right who botched the War on Poverty . <P> Much of the book focuses on a few blacks from rural Clarksdale , Miss. , some of the hundreds of thousands of sharecroppers and their families who were forced off the fields of the Mississippi Delta after the widespread adoption of the mechanical cotton picker . Lured by the promise of decent pay in the North , they flowed upward along the lines of the Illinois Central Railroad , their ears ringing with the Bible accounts of the children of Israel making their way to the promised land . <P> Lemann deals directly with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind helped lead them into the trap of ghetto poverty . He sides with those who believe that a high number of unwed mothers , female-headed households and short-lived marriages were characteristics of sharecropper life that were reproduced in the Northern slums . But he stops short of the conclusion that often follows : broken families or a " culture of poverty " created the disaster of the ghettos . He puts the blame instead on the disappearance of unskilled manufacturing jobs , a problem misguided federal policies did little to remedy . <P> The book 's sharpest commentary is reserved for Washington . In the city Lemann describes , the real corridors of power are the margins of agency memos , where bureaucrats fight a war of ideas in scribbled asides . The Promised Land is indispensable for understanding how the War on Poverty advanced along the wrong front , favoring panaceas like community action and higher welfare payments while devoting too little attention to job creation . In the end , Lemann insists , the federal effort had its greatest impact by employing ghetto blacks in antipoverty agencies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ghetto.
