<p> Sprawling in the hidden recesses of the Museum of Natural History , the Department of Anthropology is n't easy to find . But ever since I watched Douglas Owsley open a 120-year-old iron coffin in his lab ( Around the Mall , June 1988 ) , I 've been able to make my way back . His enthusiasm for old bones has infected me . I 've trailed him like a bloodhound through the museum and to some of his digs  --  not for ghoulish excitement , but for a unique chance to touch the past . <p> " See these marks at the joint ? " says Owsley , caressing a dry , brown bone . " This lady had arthritis . " And I am oddly moved by that unremarkable revelation about an unknown woman who died far away , more than a century ago . <p> When Doug called me a year ago to invite me to a dig at what he hoped was a Civil War burial site , I could n't say no . The site was a wooded ridge just south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1862 and ' 63 , skirmishers in blue and butternut sniped at one another across the river , batteries dueled at long range , and cavalry , crossing at the fords , clashed in yelling , saber-swinging charges . One such cavalry action turned into the big , bloody Battle of Brandy Station . <p> A small , tree-shaded country church , St. James Episcopal , stood on the ridge , not far from the killing ground . It did n't survive the war , but its graveyard did , lying undisturbed for 120 years . When developers began to eye with conjecture the surrounding pastoral acreage , the church took another look at the old resting place . <p> Doug Owsley learned of the development plans through his network of interested friends . He realized that casualties from the Civil War very likely lay at peace among the old St. James parishioners . Church officials asked him to help them find out and gave him permission to dig . <p> I enjoyed the drive through the lush Virginia countryside and found the site with little trouble . The hazy heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of a dirt road . A bulky sheriff in Confederate gray ambled over and eyed me as though I were a perpetrator . <p> " You gon na dig ? " he asked . <p> " You bet , " I said . <p> He turned away , shaking his head at yet another human idiocy , and I threaded my way through the underbrush toward the sound of voices . <p> Doug suddenly appeared  --  a trim and youthful man with spots of mud on his spectacles  --  and led me into the shade of the trees . Among the hickories and oaks , Doug 's crew , uniformed in jeans and sweat-damp shirts , cleared brush to find headstones and footstones , spaded away turf , shaved off the reddish soil with flat trowels , tipped dirt into plastic buckets and lugged them to frames of wire mesh for sifting . <p> Larger particles were spilled on rough camp table to be handled , peered at , usually discarded . Sometimes a piece was slipped into a plastic sandwich bag , and a voice would rise above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Work nearby would stop as people craned for a look at a bead , a button , a potsherd . <p> " They 're all volunteers , " Doug said . " Some are experts  --  archaeologist , forensic specialists , my own colleagues from the Smithsonian . Others are grad students , history buffs , local folks . Most are my regular crowd that join me again and again . But some here are members of the church . After all , the burial ground belongs to them . " <p> At a clearing , diggers were uncovering old bricks . " Foundations , " said Owsley . " The church was built in the 1840s and was used as a field hospital during the Brandy Station fight . Later the Yankees simply took it apart to build winter huts . <p> " In 1868 , " Doug went on , " the church was rebuilt a few miles away as Christ Episcopal . Its members have n't lost interest in the old site , and I 've done my best to explain the importance of this archaeological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between generations . " <p> Douglas Owsley can be very convincing . No one could be gentler as he explains to a puzzled stranger that taking a look at Great-grandfather 's body is important to science . No one could be more inspiring when he calls one of his regular crew in the middle of Murphy Brown to say he has authority to open a family plot where burials go back two centuries . " You can make it by 8 if you start at 5 . Oh , and bring sandwiches . " He was born and raised in Wyoming . He got addicted to this kind of hands-on history thanks to a professor at the University of Wyoming who took him on some digs . He 's worked on all kinds of burials , but the Civil War , thoroughly documented by both sides , fascinates him as it does many of us . " Here you can sometimes get a positive identification , " he told me . " And that prospect keeps you on edge . " <p> But it 's slow work . At Culpeper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressions in the ground that usually indicate a grave . They 'd listen for the faint thud of hardpan , and feel for slight differences in the texture and resistance of the soil . After shaving away considerable quantities of soil , they 'd often find a layer of smooth dirt with a darkened patch , eerily taking the shape of a human skeleton . Someone aptly called it a " ghost . " <p> As is so often the case when I join a field trip , nothing happened on the day I was there . But I drove home smitten with the excitement of the search . <p> A few weeks later , I was off again . A new housing development was encroaching upon the family burial ground of an old Virginia plantation . Family descendants and the Manassas Museum had asked Owsley to help them relocate the cemetery to the protected land near the main house . <p> I talked to one of the family , a woman who dubiously watched , with me , the excavation of her ancestors and tried to remember them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " But I have no feeling for the old place . I live in Richmond , my brother 's in Colorado , the family 's all split and gone . " She was silent for a moment . Then : " I guess I 'm glad they 're helping science . But , personally , I 'm getting partial to cremation . " <p> Having always been partial to cremation , I 've been tending the other way . It 's appealing to think that in 200 years I could offer something of value . Returning home that afternoon I suggested to my wife that I was considering being buried . <p> " All that expense ! " she exclaimed . <p> Some weeks later I visited Doug Owsley 's office to tie up the loose ends of the digs I 'd seen . At Culpeper , he told me , the crew finally excavated a soldier . " He and several others lay a little apart from the regular church graves . He 'd been buried quickly , without a coffin , but with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of him . Then someone laid a greatcoat over him before filling in the grave . " <p> " What do you know about him ? " I asked . <p> " We found evidence to place him in the Washington Artillery of New Orleans . They fought alongside some South Carolina outfits in August of 1862 . " I recalled reading about the Washington Artillery : " kid-glove soldiers " from the best New Orleans families . Even lowly privates were apt to bring along their " body servants " when they enlisted . <p> " What was he , a blue-blooded college boy ? " I asked . <p> " No , surprisingly , he was much older than most , " said Doug , looking at a form sheet on his desk . " Probably around 32 . And he 'd worked hard ; he had heel spurs  --  spikelike bony projections at the back of the heel that result from pulling stresses of the Achilles tendon . And it appears that he was probably an Irish immigrant . " <p> " Why Irish ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only two of the men in that unit who were killed at Brandy Station were in their 30s , and both of them were Irish . Both also had worked as laborers . <p> " We found a clay pipe in his pocket , " he added . " It still had a dottle in it . A botanist probably could tell you how good the tobacco was  --  and maybe where it was grown . " Without history , Doug 's forensics would have limited meaning . Civil War records supply facts about the units engaged , their casualties , the dates of the action . In this case it was August 23 , 1862 , when Lee maneuvered to keep the Federal forces under John Pope on the northern side of the Rappahannock , and to find a place where they could cross it themselves . In a few days the Rebel plan succeeded , and Lee and Jackson pinned down Pope and pummeled him . We call the battle Second Bull Run or Second Manassas . <p> Owsley admits that Virginia digs are difficult because the soil is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigated military remains near Santa Fe , offers ideal conditions . Here , in 1862 , a Confederate force sweeping up the Rio Grande from Texas was trapped and beaten by Federals . As the Rebs entered Apache Canyon ( they called it La Glorieta Pass ) , they met devastating fire from Colorado militiamen who had the high ground and knew how to shoot . <p> " Many wounds were in the upper part of the skull , " said Owsley . He led me into his lab and rummaged for some x rays . " Look at this bullet hole . Look at the fragments of lead that became embedded in the bone when the bullet splintered . And here 's where one bullet hit an arm , passed through and down and smashed the hipbone when it exited . The man must have been crouching for cover when the Federal sharpshooter fired down on him . " <p> He tapped at a film of a piece of jawbone : " The third molars are just in . That fits the age of one of the youngest Rebel soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is that how you tell age ? " I asked . <p> " It 's one of the ways . We check the third molars and the formation of the crowns and roots of the teeth . And we check for wear . We also look for plaque and cavities , just like your dentist , but that gives us information about dental pathology , not about age . " <p> " What about sex ? " I inquired . " The overall size of the skeleton , of course . Men are generally bigger , " he explained . " And then there 's the . . . here , come and have a look . " He produced a bulky hipbone . " See this notch ? That 's for the sciatic nerve . In a male it forms a smaller angle than in a female . Now look at this skull . See the pronounced line along the side ? That 's where muscles are anchored . And here , at the back , a distinct bump for the neck muscles . This is a classic male skull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around . Female . " <p> As I drove home , I found myself thinking that I had come almost too close to our most tragic war . It 's one thing to get excited by the accounts of Bruce Catton and Shelby Foote , to read Lee 's letters and thumb through Battles and Leaders of the Civil War . It 's another to feel you know a 32-year-old Irishman in a high-society unit who put his pipe in his pocket while he was helping serve his cannon . And a 1 7-yearold who entered a Southwestern canyon and never knew what hit him . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Physical anthropologist Doug Owsley prepares to dig at Civil War burial site . <p> By Edwards Park <p>
