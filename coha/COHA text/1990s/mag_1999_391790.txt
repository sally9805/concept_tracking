Section : MENOPAUSE . SURVEY REPORT . Women are faced with more options than ever - and more confusing evidence . Here 's advice for healthy living after menopause <p> The 21 million baby-boom women who will reach menopause in the next 10 years have more ways to cope with its effects than their mothers dreamed of . They can take hormones ( as pills , creams , or patches ) , take the " designer " estrogen raloxifene , or opt for a plant-based estrogen . They can also , of course , go through the process naturally , as all women did from Eve 's day until the 1950s . Or they can combine the two approaches , taking hormones for only part of their postmenopausal years . " Within the next two years , there will be so many choices we wo n't know which ones to make , " predicts Dr. Leon Speroff , professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health Sciences University . <p> Even the decision for or against taking estrogen is more problematic than before . For years , research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top killer of elderly women , but that it promoted breast cancer . In the summer of 1998 , however , the experts were stopped cold by results from a major study of postmenopausal women who already had heart disease . It showed an immediate 50 percent increase in heart attacks after those women started taking hormones . <p> Other recent studies provided an unnerving paradox regarding breast cancer : Although postmenopausal women who take hormones get breast cancer more often than women who do n't , they die of it less often . <p> All this has left even medical types scratching their heads . One reason is that hormone researchers have never conducted a randomized clinical trial on the long-term effects of replacement hormones on healthy post-menopausal women . In such a study , participants would receive either hormones or a look-alike placebo , and would then be watched for many years for evidence of disease . Such a test , the Women 's Health Initiative , is now under way and will involve more than 27,000 women , but results wo n't be in until at least 2005 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide what to do based on less-complete information - from short-term studies of hormones ' effects and from long-term " observational " studies of women who make their own health choices . Because neither type of study provides definitive answers , there 's a lot of room for interpretation - and disagreement . " Estrogen has been made into quite an emotional issue , " says Trudy Bush , professor of epidemiology and preventive medicine at the University of Maryland , who worked on the heart study . " There are people who think it causes cancer and other people who think it 's the best thing since sliced bread . " <p> To provide women with a road map through menopause and beyond , we pored over the research literature on hormones and women 's health . To get a sense of how women cope with the immediate effects of menopause , we also surveyed more than 30,000 post-menopausal readers . Although almost half of the women surveyed experienced at least one symptom seriously - especially hot flashes - most simply did n't see menopause as a big deal . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record , our readers have more years of education than the population at large and so are n't representative of all women . ) <p> For women who have yet to experience menopause , there 's another message : Try not to worry too much in advance . Readers who experienced three or more symptoms seriously were more likely to report they had entered menopause concerned about potential problems than were women who had no serious symptoms . Other studies have found the same pattern . <p> Whatever path a woman chooses , there are commonsense steps she can take to ease the journey . <p> MEDICATING MENOPAUSE <p> For eons , most women died too young for menopause and the diseases of old age to become an issue . By the 1940s , however , doctors had noticed that plunging estrogen levels set off hot flashes . By the 1960s , menopause had become an " estrogen deficiency state " that was said to need medical treatment . The treatment most used then , as now , was Premarin , a mix of estrogen compounds extracted from the urine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. since 1992 . <p> By the mid-1970s , it became clear that taking estrogen alone increased the risk of cancer of the uterus by sevenfold or more . High doses also boosted the risk of blood clots in legs and lungs . That led doctors to halve the dose of estrogen and add progesterone , the other hormone that controls menstruation . By inducing an artificial menstrual period each month , progesterone prevents the overgrowth of the uterine lining that increases the risk of cancer . ( Women who have had a hysterectomy need not take progesterone . ) <p> By the 1980s , scientists had established that estrogen could slow or stop osteoporosis , the otherwise rapid and inevitable thinning of bones . Then came research showing benefits to cholesterol levels and the heart . Armed with that evidence , many doctors began advocating that women take hormones after reaching menopause and continue for life . But the merit of long-term therapy does n't seem as sure as it did a few years ago . <p> Here 's what scientists know about the effects of hormone replacement on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Heart disease . Of all the benefits from hormones , none seemed so important as protection from cardiovascular disease , the No. 1 killer of women over 65 . The most significant evidence came from the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions Trial ( catchy acronym : PEPI ) , a short-term study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health . It found that healthy postmenopausal women given hormones had higher levels of " good " cholesterol and lower levels of " bad " cholesterol than women given a placebo . Moreover , observational studies revealed that women taking estrogen lowered their risk of heart disease between 35 percent and 50 percent . <p> Based on that evidence , the heart benefits of estrogen looked so overwhelming that they more than canceled out any increase risk of breast cancer . Add the certain protection against bone loss , and there seemed no reason for a woman to avoid hormones unless she had an extremely high risk of breast cancer . In our survey , 57 percent of women on hormones said they started taking them to prevent heart attacks . <p> Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't saying what they seemed to . Those scientists concluded that , as a group , the women who elected to take hormones would have had less heart disease than the others anyway : They were thinner , had better cholesterol levels , got more exercise , had lower blood pressure , and were better educated and wealthier ( factors that have a powerful influence on health . ) <p> Then , in August 1998 , came a bombshell . The $40 million Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study ( catchy acronym : HERS ) looked at more than 2,700 women , averaging about 66 years old , who already had advanced heart disease . Not only did hormones fail to help , they seemed to hurt . During the study 's first year , women on hormones had 57 fatal and nonfatal heart attacks , while women who took a placebo had 38 . Moreover , the risk of blood clots was more than three times as high in women taking hormones . The results almost persuaded the ethics board overseeing the study to halt it early . <p> After that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deaths was similar for both groups of women . Cholesterol levels did improve for women on hormones , as predicted . But since no one is sure exactly what caused the disastrous initial results , it may not be safe for women with heart disease to start taking hormones . <p> Should women who do n't have heart disease take hormones in hopes of preventing it ? The evidence so far suggests they 'll get some cardiovascular protection if they do - at least if they also keep their weight down , exercise , and refrain from smoking . <p> Breast cancer . Scientists have known for years that the longer breasts are exposed to natural estrogen , the higher the risk of breast cancer . A 49-year-old woman who is still menstruating has a higher risk than another 49-year-old who started menstruating at the same age but went through menopause . Does replacing estrogen after menopause extend the risk ? It can certainly make breasts feel uncomfortable - swelling is one of estrogen 's side effects . And in our survey , fear of cancer was the third most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first two : lack of a real need for it and concern about unknown risks ) . <p> Evidence from dozens of studies suggests that hormone replacement does increase the risk of breast cancer . Last year , a group of British scientists tracked down the records of 160,000 women who had participated in 51 separate observational studies . The scientists reanalyzed and combined the results from all those studies and found that taking hormones for a year increases the lifetime risk of breast cancer by about 2 percent to 3 percent - almost exactly as much as a year 's delay in natural menopause . For every 1,000 women who have been taking hormones for 20 years , that means an extra 12 cases of breast cancer by age 70 - 75 cases vs. 63 . <p> On the other hand , if a woman stops taking hormones , her risk drops to normal within five years . <p> But that 's not the end of the story . The British analysis and other studies found that breast cancers in women who take hormones tend to be more localized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do n't . The bottom line : Women who take hormones get breast cancer slightly more often but die of its less often . <p> Bone loss . Estrogen treatment ( with or without progesterone ) stops bone loss in its tracks . The PEPI study showed that without hormones , women lost 2 percent of bone density in three years ; on hormones , they gained 2 percent to 5 percent in that time . Other studies have found that starting hormones soon after menopause and continuing on them for life can reduce the risk of fractures by up to 70 percent . Preventing osteoporosis was the No. 1 reason our readers gave for starting treatments . <p> For women who start on hormones but stop before their 70s , when the risk of fracture rises , there 's a catch : Deprived of hormones , bones not only start thinning immediately , but may thin especially fast . New research suggests , however , that women who start taking hormones in their late 60s and continue into their 70s get nearly as much protection against fracture as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashes . Studies agree that hormones get rid of hot flashes , which occur when the brain , presumably prompted by changing hormone levels , abruptly resets the body 's thermostat . A rise in body temperature is followed by sweating and , often , chills . When flashes occur at night , sufferers may wake up shivering and drenched . Some women sail through menopause with nary a flash , like 17 percent of our survey respondents . But for a significant minority - about 30 percent in our survey - flashes can be almost unbearable . <p> Sexual changes . Lack of estrogen causes the vagina 's lining to become thinner and drier , which can make intercourse painful . Hormones can prevent or reverse those effects . <p> In a detailed study , the Cleveland Clinic examined 67 sexually active postmenopausal women and found that those who did n't take hormones had no more problems with vaginal dryness or painful intercourse than those who did . Of our readers who were in a sexual relationship , nearly four of five said menopause had either no effect or a positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not they had taken hormones . <p> Effective treatments for dryness include low-dosage vaginal estrogen creams , which have minimal systemic effects , and nonhormonal lubricants . <p> Colon cancer . At least three observational studies have found that women who take hormones cut their risk of developing this common cancer by one-third to one-half . <p> Alzheimer 's disease . Observational studies have found , overall , that women who have taken estrogen get this disease about 30 percent less often than those who do n't . However , women who choose hormones tend to be healthier and better educated , two factors that studies have suggested can influence the risk of Alzheimer 's . <p> Skin changes . Exams of nearly 4,000 postmenopausal women showed that white women who have taken hormones have fewer wrinkles and moister skin than those who have n't . <p> Depression . Two major long-term studies have shown that menopause has little effect on depression . Women who became depressed after menopause did so after an upsetting event such as the death of a spouse , not because of menopause itself . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DRUGS , NEW DOSES <p> For many years , women who wanted to take estrogen had no choice but Premarin . Women who still had their uterus also took medroxyprogesterone acetate , marketed as Provera . Now there are other choices : Different estrogens and progesterones . Some women suffer unpleasant side effects - among them , bloating , weight gain , and nausea - when taking hormone-replacement drugs . In our survey , 21 percent of women who quit hormones said they did so because of such symptoms . Since the various estrogen and progesterone alternatives are not identical , switching drugs may help . Different schedules . When doctors first prescribed progesterone , they did so for only part of the month . But the regular bleeding that results can be bothersome : In our survey , 18 percent of women who quit taking hormones did so because they did n't want periods . Although some women still use that schedule , it 's now known that lower , daily doses of progesterone protect the uterus from cancer just as well and often eliminate periods . <p> Another schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women many years past menopause , is to take progesterone only every three or four months . Different routes of administration . Women who do n't want to take a daily pill can choose a skin patch that dispenses a daily dose of estrogen . Because its estrogen does n't pass through the liver , as with a pill , however , a patch does n't raise " good " cholesterol . Testosterone . Women make this hormone , though at far lower rates than men , and it declines after menopause , though more slowly than estrogen . Some doctors use it to restore the libido of women whose sexual desire has declined after menopause . Combinations of estrogen and testosterone are available . <p> The response to all these drugs can vary with the individual . Women may need to experiment ( with their doctor 's advice ) with formulations , dosages , and routes of administration . <p> ' DESIGNER ' ESTROGENS <p> <p> Until the past year , estrogen was the only hormone replacement in town , but that 's no longer true . Decades of research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term is actually a misnomer : They are n't estrogen , but they fit into the same cellular receptors . In some parts of the body , they do what estrogen does ; in others , the opposite . <p> The first designer estrogen , tamoxifen , is n't used as a menopause drug because of an unfortunate property : It increases the risk of uterine cancer . Instead , it 's used as chemotherapy in postmenopausal women with breast cancer ; and in October , it was approved as a means of reducing the likelihood of breast cancer in women at high risk . <p> The second such drug to reach the market , raloxifene ( Evista ) , represents a potentially important alternative to hormone treatments . It protects bone density almost as well as estrogen and has been shown to cut the risk of spine fractures in half in women who have taken it for two years . ( It 's not known yet whether raloxifene prevents hip fractures . ) It also has beneficial effects on cholesterol . Yet raloxifene does n't stimulate breast or uterine tissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it does n't get rid of hot flashes , either ; it can actually bring them on . ) RECOMMENDATIONS <p> Until well past the turn of the century , women who go through menopause will lack full information about the ultimate risks and benefits of hormone treatments . Still , it 's possible to design a sensible postmenopausal health-protection plan . First , have your doctor assess your risk for heart disease , osteoporosis , and breast cancer . Then discuss the options below . Whichever you select , realize that you can , and should , reassess your decision as the years pass . <p> 1 . Hormones at first . Most women can safely take hormones to relieve temporary symptoms like hot flashes . The added risk of breast cancer is minimal when hormones are taken for a year or two . If you decide to stop taking hormones , your doctor should cut the dosage gradually - stopping cold turkey will itself trigger hot flashes . <p> Be aware , though , that once you stop taking hormones , the protection they give your bones and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . For most healthy women , it 's safe to start taking hormones immediately after menopause and continue indefinitely . The exceptions : women at high risk for breast cancer or blood clots . All women who make this choice should examine their breasts , and have mammograms and checkups , regularly . 3 . Hormones only in old age . Studies have shown it 's never too late to start on hormones ; they can benefit bone and cholesterol at age 75 as they do at age 55 . In fact , there may be more point in taking them when you 're older : The average age for a first heart attack in women is 74 ; for hip fracture , about 80 . <p> Therefore , some doctors are recommending that healthy women take hormones for symptom relief in their early 50s , if needed , then stop . ( During the years that follow , of course , women should be checked regularly for osteoporosis and unhealthy cholesterol levels . ) When women are 65 or so , they can resume taking hormones and have protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running a long-term risk of breast cancer . <p> But there are downsides to this strategy , too . In light of the HERS study , many doctors are loath to start women over 65 on hormones without checking for hidden heart disease . Moreover , starting hormones long after menopause can make side effects like swollen breasts especially disconcerting . <p> 4 . No hormones . Some women , especially those at low risk for heart or bone disease , do n't feel a need to take drugs to treat what is , after all , a normal stage of life . For them , there 's good news , as Francine Grodstein , assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School , notes : " There are lots of ways to prevent disease besides hormone therapy - for example , stopping smoking , having a healthy diet , being physically active - without incurring any risk whatsoever . " Together , exercise and quitting smoking have more impact than estrogen on fractures and heart disease . <p> For additional alternatives , see " Help without hormones , " below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our 1996 Annual Questionnaire who had gone through menopause naturally ( not as the result of surgery ) , here 's the percentage who reported the following symptoms as " serious . " TABLE <p> <p> HELP WITHOUT HORMONES <p> Below , other ways to deal with conditions that estrogen affects . Even those that do n't work quite as well as estrogen can help many women . For instance , half of our survey respondents who used exercise and relaxation techniques for hot flashes found those measures effective . TABLE <p> WHAT HAPPENS DURING MENOPAUSE <p> Menopause has a standard definition : the passage of at least a year without having a menstrual period . It happens because the few remaining eggs in the ovaries gradually lose their ability to respond to hormonal stimulation , thus short-circuiting the feedback mechanism that keeps the monthly cycle going . <p> For all but a small minority of women , periods do n't stop at once . Rather , during " perimenopause , " which lasts from one to five years , their cycle gradually becomes irregular as ovarian function dwindles . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , the ovaries were essentially dead . They now realize that the connective tissue of the ovaries continues to produce low levels of hormones after menopause , which is one reason the ovaries - the female analog of testicles - should not be removed routinely during hysterectomies , as they once were . Women also continue to produce estrogen in their fat tissue . There 's individual variation in estrogen production after menopause , with some women making essentially none , and others making enough to keep their heart protected and their bones from thinning dangerously . <p> No one knows why women 's ovaries shut down decades before their other organs fail . The only other mammals to experience menopause are whales and elephants - like us , intelligent creatures with very long lifespans . All reach menopause at about the same age - 50 - suggesting that there may be some as-yet-unknown physiological reason for the phenomenon . <p> SOY PROTEIN , BLACK COHOSH . . . ESTROGEN FROM PLANTS ? <p> For postmenopausal women wary of hormones , " all natural " plant-based estrogens can be tempting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1.8-billion-a-year market for prescription hormones , are growing rapidly . Even mainstream pharmaceutical companies are getting into the act . Last fall , Bayer began marketing a " menopause health " phytoestrogen supplement . <p> But it pays to be wary of phytoestrogens , too . Scientists are just beginning to sort out their effects on the body . Moreover , these products are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration , enabling their manufacturers to make such vague claims as " maintaining healthy estrogen levels " without proof . " Patients empty bags of this stuff on my desk and ask if I can help monitor them , " says Dr. Wolf Utian , professor of reproductive biology at Case Western Reserve University . " But I do n't even know if what 's on the label is actually in the bottle . " <p> THE LOCK AND KEY <p> Many body tissues are equipped with estrogen receptors , docking ports for the estrogen molecule . Phytoestrogen molecules are shaped enough like estrogen that they fit into those receptors . But while estrogen invariably stimulates cellular activity when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phytoestrogens stimulate estrogenlike activity or block it - or a little bit of both . <p> One possible association between phytoestrogens and menopausal symptoms comes from Japan . There , women have a much lower incidence of heart disease than American women , and fewer than 25 percent entering menopause report hot flashes - vs. 80 percent of American women . Coincidentally or not , Japan also has the highest consumption of soy-based food in the world - about 100 times as much , on average , as the U.S. <p> The major types of phytoestrogens are thought to be isoflavones , found in soy protein , and lignans , found in flaxseeds , whole grains , and some fruits and vegetables . Here 's what 's known about the effects of those compounds : <p> Heart disease . A number of studies ( though not all ) have shown that soy protein improves cholesterol levels , and a recent Australian study showed that it makes women 's arteries more elastic . Neither result guarantees less heart disease . <p> Breast cancer . Some observational studies have found that women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer than women who consumed the least . <p> Hot flashes . Some clinical studies have shown that soy protein reduces hot flashes ( but far less than estrogen ) ; others have revealed little or no effect . In all studies , gastrointestinal reactions caused many women to stop taking the supplements . <p> The term " phytoestrogen " also has come to refer to various herbal remedies . Among the most popular are dong quai , black cohosh , licorice ( in pill form ) , and red clover . We found one placebo-controlled study of black cohosh , which said that herb did have an effect on hot flashes , and one of dong quai , which said that herb did not have an effect . We found no studies at all on licorice or red clover . <p> RECOMMENDATIONS <p> <p> There 's not enough evidence to recommend herbal supplements to treat menopause symptoms , but soy-based foods and those high in lignans have been a nutritious part of the human diet for thousands of years , and it 's fine for menopausal women to eat them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly if you 're already taking prescription hormones . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Sampling soy . Soy flour , whole soybeans , textured soy protein , soy milk , tofu , miso , and tempeh generally have plenty of isoflavones , a class of phyto-estrogens . In soy isolates and concentrates ( in some processed foods ) , amounts vary . Soy sauce has none . <p>
