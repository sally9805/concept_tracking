IT 'S NOT THE SIZE THAT COUNTS , IT 'S WHAT YOU DO WITH IT THAT MATTERS BY FRED MATHENY // Cyclists spend a lot of time thinking about their legs . The common dream : To look down past your navel and see a pro racer 's gams , ripped like Arnold 's biceps and bulging with more veins than Andy Rooney 's nose . Heck , if some savvy plastic surgeon started offering silicone calf-and-quad implants , there 'd be a line of drooling bikies out the door and around the corner . If you find you ca n't carve the leg of your dreams no matter how much you ride or weight train , blame your mom and dad . It 's mostly genetics that determine how defined your muscles are . But take heart , ye of spongy-looking legs : There 's little correlation between the appearance of a cyclists ' legs and his performance , according to Harvey Newton , executive director of the National Strength and Conditioning Association . We chatted him up about the quest for the chiseled look . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the peloton but according to Newton , a former racer and enthusiastic cyclist , " People waste time in the quest for big calves . They 're hard to develop and do n't grow much . Calf size is genetically determined and there 's not much you can do about it . That 's why bodybuilders sometimes get surgical implants . " ( See ? We told you . ) Also , " he says , " biomechanical studies show that big calves contribute little to the pedal stroke . They 're essentially a cable that transfers the power of thigh and buttock muscles down through the foot to the pedal . " That 's why skinny calves , as long as they 're strong , work as well as bulging ones  --  and as a perk , they create less wind resistance for the aero-geeks among us . Newton likes to cite multiple-World Champion medalist Erin Hartwell , an American kilo specialist that Newton worked with at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs . " Although Hartwell has well-developed quads , his calves are skinny . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Role of Body Fat We tend to associate having a low bodyfat percentage with having increased muscle size or definition , says Newton , because skin without much fat beneath it highlights the muscles and veins underneath . Many pro riders ' legs do n't look especially large when they 're encased in jeans-but in photos taken when they 're on the podium in cycling shorts , their legs look much more impressive . Muscle definition-the impression that the skin is made of transparent plastic wrap revealing all beneath it-is a visual illusion . How to shed muscle-veiling fat in your legs ? It 's a simple recipe : " More miles , reduced-fat diet and good genetics , " says Newton . So What Can I Do ? Do n't neglect the weight room . " A cyclist needs balanced development to avoid injury , " counsels Newton , " because cycling is a repetitive motion . " He recommends the old standbys : squats , lunges , leg presses , hamstring curls and calf raises to strengthen the legs . Will these exercises-or doing hard repeats up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? " The word ' sculpt ' implies you can slap a little muscle on here , build up something there-but you ca n't do that , " warns Newton . Although you can strengthen , and to a certain extent enlarge , muscle groups , the ultimate size and shape of your muscles is determined by your great grandpa . The Bottom Line Photograph Photograph Photograph // Form follows function . " Good legs , argues Newton , " are a by-product of good cycling performance . Three people on the podium in the Tour de France probably have different-looking legs . If you have a well-rounded cycling program , leg development will follow . If you 're still dissatisfied , the next stop is the plastic surgeon for silicon implants . " <p>
