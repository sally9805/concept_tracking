Section : The Arts <p> . . . is a Welshman who sings , Willie 's guitar with gut strings , and a cheery bluesman named King . Plus books about trucks , teapots and tile to celebrate the season with style <p> GEE , IT 'S NOT SHAPING UP TO BE MUCH OF a Christmas here at NEWSWEEK . The election follies are over , Newt 's profile is so low we may get letters asking " Newt who ? " and the stock market still has n't crashed . So by way of consolation , we went out and bought stuff  --  all the books and CDs we 've wanted all year  --  the excuse being that it 's time to do gift ideas again . It 's not that these things are n't great ( though Sun Ra 's Disney tribute may not be the thing for Uncle Harry ) . But what we 'd give for a good donnybrook , even a flap  --  or news that , say , hair loss could be reversed by surfing the Net . So Noel , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get through this season . Always have . Books <p> There 's no sense tiptoeing around this : we 've found the ideal gift for the art lover on your list , and you ca n't afford it . It 's the Grove Dictionary of Art ( 32,600pages. $8,800 ) . It 's got 34 stately dark green , mostly readable volumes , written by 6,700 art historians . It 's got pictures . And guess what . The closest you 're realistically going to get to it is in a very well endowed library . So get over it . <p> Back in the real world , Colin Eisler 's Masterworks in Berlin : A City 's Paintings Reunited ( Bullfinch . $125 ) reminds us of the treasures that can now easily be seen on a trip to the reunited German capital . Berlin has no 800-pound gorilla of a museum like Paris 's Louvre , but it has a bunch of first-rate second-tier institutions , many hidden behind the Iron Curtain for half a century . And we 've got a pocket-size stocking-stuffer : Books of Hours ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours " were flexible amounts of time bracketed by prayer , and small , illuminated " books of hours " guided devotions ; this eclectic sampling reproduces lovely pages in almost the original sizes . <p> Roger Sabin 's Comics , Comix &; Graphic Novels : A History of Comic Art ( Phaidon. $59.95 ) is n't the only such book you 'll find out there  --  just the best . Sabin is thorough and likes all the right people ( George Herriman , Harvey Kurtzman ) . When someone like R. Crumb dominates an era , Sabin gives him a lot more space than some mindlessly " evenhanded " survey would . Production values ? A-plus . <p> To you , magazine-cover artists may be no higher than cartoonists on the food chain . Not to us . In 1962 , Esquire magazine hired adman George Lois to design covers that would be the visual equivalent of the writers ' irreverent " new journalism . " Covering the ' 60s : George Lois  --  The Esquire Era ( Monacelli. $35 ) has the classics : Andy Warhol drowning in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Santa hat . These images remind us that in weird times , being a smartass may be healthier than keeping a stiff upper lip . On the other hand , the ravishing , red-boxed The Best of Flair ( HarperCollins. $250 ) is enough to depress the hell out of us . This fashion magazine debuted in 1950 and died after 12 lavish issues , festooned with expensive die-cuts and pullouts and featuring essays by the likes of Simone de Beauvoir and George Bernard Shaw . There 's a message here about the realities of the magazine business that we are just not up for hearing during the holiday season . But you go ahead and enjoy . <p> One Time , One Place . Photographs by Eudora Welty ( University Press of Mississippi . $27.50 ) . While working for the WPA in the ' 30s , the then not-so-famous writer photographed , in black and white , fellow Mississippians butchering hogs , making molasses , lugging ice from the icehouse . Her sense of detail  --  the way white dresses at a Holiness church seem to glow from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around us when we close the book . Welty 's people could n't have afforded the funkiest clunker in Pickups : Classic American Trucks ( Random House . $39.95 ) . And most of these vehicles  --  a 1913 International MW with a load of hay , a tailfinned , electric blue 1960 El Camino  --  have been lovingly , expensively restored . West Virginia barber Ron Jones 's ' 33 Chevy truck is shot parked in front of a church sign reading PUT YOUR WILL IN NEUTRAL SO GOD CAN SHIFT YOU . <p> Erwin Blumenfeld 's ' 50s photo of a gussied-up model resting her enigmatic face on the hood of a Caddy is a universe away , but the Cars " R " Us subtext is the same . Blumenfeld , who shot for Vogue and Harper 's Bazaar , was once a Dada collagist ; Blumenfeld Photographs : A Passion for Beauty ( Abrams. $60 ) shows that in photographing " the eternal feminine , " he kept a smidgen of ironic distance . <p> We might 've known there 'd be a resurgence of tilemaking : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , by Jill Herbers and Roy Wright , and Tiles ( Potter . $40 ) , by Olivia Bell Buehl and Lisl Dennis , both look great . And these folks sure know tile . But if you buy only one tile book this year , make it Mosaics of Roman Africa ( George Braziller. $90 ) , displaying the elegant floor tiling the Romans did in Tunisia from the 2d to the 4th century . We used to think tiles were just to put teapots on . Have we learned ! And we 've learned about teapots , too . Garth Clark 's The Eccentric Teapot ( Abbeville. $29.95 ) should put to rest that " short and stout " canard . He 's got teepees , fire hydrants , vampires , Brooke Shields and one topped with a nuclear mushroom cloud . <p> A couple of these would 've dressed up Richard Weston 's Modernism ( Phaidon. $75 ) , but otherwise we ca n't kick . This handsome history looks at modernist design in all its international complexity , from constructivist posters to bentwood Aalto chairs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houses ( Abrams. $49.50 ) has dream domiciles featured in Architectural Record magazine over the past 40 years . Earlier ones sit like stately sculptures in wooded isolation , but in the ' 80s , postmodernism came in the door and rules went out the window . <p> Yet this architectural war zone was a playpen compared with turn-of-the-century Istanbul . Diana Barillari and Ezio Godoli 's Istanbul 1900 ( Rizzoli. $75 ) chronicles ( and , better still , illustrates ) the war between art nouveau Westernizers and the Islamic backlash . And the winner ? Anybody who ever saw these buildings : idiosyncratic byproducts of cultures in conflict . In Japan , the analogous Momoyama period ( 1573-1615 ) saw the introduction of firearms and an opening to foreign trade . Japan 's Golden Age : Momoyama ( Yale . $40 ) has the once hot skinny on all this  --  and some of the most beautiful art in history . <p> James Thurber 's writings and drawings were sweet and wacky , vinegary and bleak , and always alive to the comic possibilities of life and the beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single bulging volume , James Thurber , Writings and Drawings ( Library of America . $35 ) , edited by Garrison Keillor . Thurber 's baseball-playing midget , Pearl du Monville ( in the story " You Could Look It Up ) , was only a slight exaggeration of characters who used to inhabit the major leagues . Songwriter Seth Swirsky began corresponding with ballplayers a couple of years ago , and his Baseball Letters ( Kodansha. $24 ) , to and from the likes of Ted Williams and Cal Ripken Jr. , include an old-time pitcher 's memories of the improbable Babe Ruth . Swirsky asked Bobby Doerr ( if you have to ask . . . ) if he 'd ever had a moment on the field when he felt " rush of happiness that you were where you were at that moment in your life ? " Doerr wrote back : " Yes . " <p> Did the world need one more translation of The Odyssey ( Viking . $35 ) ? Yes . In Robert Fagles 's lucid , muscular verse , these ancient measures stalk across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " young Dawn with her rose-red fingers " to the moment when the last suitor has been slaughtered and Odysseus takes his Penelope to bed . And Ian McKellen has recorded a pungent reading ( 12 tapes . $45.95 ) . Most audiobooks are a guilty pleasure , but this one is unabridged  --  and besides , Homer 's first readers were actually listeners . Julie Christie 's reading of Jane Austen 's Sense and Sensibility ( Penguin Audiobooks. $23.95 ) is not unabridged , but somebody did a decent job of cutting , and Christie revels in creating voices for characters from the vulgar Mrs. Jennings to the majestically clueless Mr. John Dashwood . And Penguin 's 12-tape , six-volume anthology of English Verse ( $16.95 each ) is read by a first-class crew of British actors ; Judi Dench has the sexiest voice you 'll ever hear reading Isaac Watts 's " Crucifixion to the World by the Cross of Christ . " <p> If you 've got a major film buff on your gift list , the book-length journal Projections ( $16.95 per issue ) is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it mildly . For hundreds of pages , directors , editors and production designers discuss their work for an audience of their peers . No French theory . Projections comes out once or twice a year ; you can find it in bookstores . <p> B. B. King knows he 's considered an oxymoron : a happy bluesman . " It angers me , " he writes in his autobiography , Blues All Around Me ( Avon . $23 ) , " how scholars associate the blues strictly with tragedy . " King remembers his hardscrabble upbringing in Mississippi as years of mystery and sensuality . He lost his virginity when he was 6 or 7 , and never did bother to look for it : he fathered 15 kids by 15 women . All he frets about is people thinking he should be miserable . Now it 's white " alternative " rockers who are supposed to be wretched to keep their credibility . But photographer Michael Lavine 's Noise From the Underground ( Simon &; Schuster. $25 ) , which documents the grunge revolution , suggests that even these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in faux-iconic poses ? Kurt and Courtney in a blush of love ? How dare they ? <p> If these books testify obliquely on the side of joy and pleasure , Claudia Roden 's The Book of Jewish Food ( Knopf. $35 ) actually gives you 800 recipes for attaining it . Calcutta Hilbeh , a hot green relish she calls " strange and extraordinary . " Chicken with noodles , a dish her father 's family made in Egypt . Russian fruit ravioli . Roden , who wrote the definitive books on Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine , traveled and cooked for 15 years to produce this compendium of earthly delights . <p> We thought Joy of Cooking Christmas Cookies ( Scribner. $16.95 ) was going to be our grand finale , but now we 're not so sure . Low-fat recipes are probably obligatory in the ' 90s , but Christmas cookies with canola oil instead of butter ? You know , we tried driving 55 , too . Still , the stuff that 's not good for us has that old come-hither look , and there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the **30;534;TOOLONG toys we 'll be tussling with on Christmas Eve . And it could have been " Joy of Fruitcake , " there 's that to be said for it . " Joy of Cheese and Sausage . " Hey , we 're easy . Music <p> In an old New Yorker cartoon , a man lying in bed says to his wife , " OK , I know the doctor says I 'm going to make it , but will you still play side eight of Rosenkavalier ' again ? " The last half hour of Richard Strauss 's opera is as close to heaven as music gets , and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf 's 1957 Der Rosenkavalier with Herbert von Karajan ( EMI , 3 CDs ) remains an operatic Everest . Now that it 's digitally remastered we 've got some 1s and 0s worthy of beaming into space to tell folks a zillion light-years away what we were all about . <p> Another great soprano , Leontyne Price , once described her voice as " juicy lyric "  --  and even then she sold herself short . Juicy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Essential Leontyne Price ( BMG , 11 CDs ) has arias from her famous Verdi , Puccini and Mozart roles , lieder , spirituals and song cycles , including a matchless version of Barber 's " Knoxville : Summer of 1915 . " Sure , our flesh creeps , too , when we see " opera singer " and " Broadway musical " in the same sentence . But give Welsh baritone Bryn Terfel 's Something Wonderful ( Deutsche Grammophon ) a chance before taking it to the lake to see if it 'll skip as many times as Jessye Norman 's " Lucky to Be Me . " Terfel is the Maserati of singers , going from whisper to full throttle in an instant ; he sings Rodgers and Hammerstein with perfect enunciation and , praise the Lord , in American . <p> Though he 's performed , pianist Byron Janis did n't record for 30 years because of arthritic hands . But the new Byron Janis Plays Chopin ( EMI ) shows he has n't lost the poetic precision that complements this bittersweet music . In reimagining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brisk opening strain a springy folk dance ; the tender second strain winds down like a music box and just about breaks your heart . <p> Bernard Herrmann is the one film composer whose music is instantly recognizable . The Film Scores ( Sony ) , by Esa-Pekka Salonen and the Los Angeles Philharmonic , adds his music for such films as " Taxi Driver " to his classic scores for Alfred Hitchcock . But Music From the Great Hitchcock Movie Thrillers ( London ) has the basics , with the composer himself conducting the London Philharmonic in 1969 . That woodwind-rich music from " The Trouble With Harry " is one of the drollest tone poems ever written . <p> The visionary bandleader Sun Ra was a one-man history  --  and future  --  of jazz . Sun Ra : The Singles ( Evidence , 2 CDs ) gives a taste of his eclecticism . In the ' 50s , he was doing Gershwin , doo-wop and some kind of stuff that sounds like rap . Later came the strange sci-fi songs , the chanting  --  and good straight-ahead jazz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Right ( Salute to Walt Disney ) ( 315-287-2852 ) , which is just what the subtitle says ; his " Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah " is so bent it doubles back into affectionate . Of course Louis Armstrong 's Disney Songs the Satchmo Way ( Walt Disney Records ) starts out affectionate and warms up from there . Our favorite new jazz release ? Joe Henderson Big Band ( Verve ) , the first time since the tenor player 's 1990 rediscovery that he 's recorded his own wonderful tunes . <p> The years between 1958 and 1963  --  post-Elvis , pre-Beatles  --  are the lamest in rock history . That 's why they 're interesting . This was the time of Connie Francis : she of the red lips , the prom gowns and the dreamy voice aching with sexual repression . Connie Francis Souvenirs ( Polydor , 4 CDs ) shows she did n't just sing blush-inducing " rock numbers " like " Stupid Cupid " but also Italian evergreens , " German Favorites " ( an actual album title ) and an alarming " Exodus/Havah Negilah . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boys Are . " Feminists , beware : when she wraps that silken voice around the notion that getting a man is secular salvation , you 'll believe it . <p> And can we say a word about Mr. Neil Diamond ? Brill Building drudge , brooding folkie , sequined arena hero , slightly irregular middle-aged sex symbol . The hits and misses on In My Lifetime ( Columbia , 3 CDs ) seldom catch him in mopey confessional mode ; he does characters ( " Sweet Caroline " ) and situations ( " Girl , You 'll Be a Woman Soon " ) with clarity and economy . And who else links the Monkees to UB40 to Barbra Streisand to " Pulp Fiction " ? <p> Willie Nelson is hardly a neglected figure , but if you 've been neglecting him , check out Spirit ( Island ) . This spare masterpiece stakes out a space next door to folk , around the bend from country , miles from the nearest market niche . We played it five times before it hit us that there were no bass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bobbie Nelson 's piano , Willie 's gut-string guitar ( as distinctive a voice as his voice ) and Jody Payne playing rhythm . But even Willie sounds slick next to the singers , fiddlers and banjo-players on Mountain Music of Kentucky ( Smithsonian/Folkways , 2 CDs ) . Most were already getting up in years when folklorist John Cohen recorded them back in 1959  --  and even then their music sounded archaic and archetypal . There 's an " Amazing Grace " here sung by a Baptist congregation that sounds like Gregorian chant . <p> And finally , why not some Christmas music ? Esquivel : Merry Christmas from the Space-Age Bachelor Pad ( Bar/None ) is a swinging swankfest from the Mexican master of musical whatever . It 's all sci-fi modernism and game-show gaiety , with psychotically jovial mixes of xylophone , glockenspiel , harp and bassoon . Recorded mostly in 1959-62 , the album has new intros and outros from neo-loungeheads Combustible Edison and warm holiday greetings from Esquivel himself , now in his 70s . Listening to his surreal " White Christmas , " we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have young folks think you 're cool , if a little crazed  --  that 's not such a bad holiday wish in a time of diminished expectations . Good , we thought . We 'll wish that . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Annunciation angel from Masterworks in Berlin ' <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Busting bellhp from the The Eccentric Teapot ' <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Villa design from Istanbull 1900 ' <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The Essential Leontyne Price ' 11-CD set <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ' 30s Alvar Aalto bentwood chair from Modernism ' <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Lord Byron 's poetry is on the 12-tape English Verse ' audiobooks set <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Muhammad Ali as Saint Sebastian from convering the ' 60s : George Lois , the Esquire Era ' <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Joe Henderson 's new Big Band ' CD <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Major-League players and a fan correspond in Baseball Letters ' <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Noh masks from Japan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Three Kings and Christ childin an illumination from a 15th-century Book of Hours ' <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The sock-hop songstress has a CD set , Connie Francis Souvenirs ' <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : B.B.
