" In 1963 she sat onstage before the largest crowd yet assembled in Washington , D.C. , as Martin Luther King Jr . delivered his ringing " I have a dream " speech .

In fact , the other leaders rebuffed Height 's suggestion that a woman speak at the rally where King made his most famous speech . " The only female voice heard at the march , " she points out , " was that of Mahalia Jackson . " Height 's " great contribution , " says James Farmer , former leader of the Congress for Racial Equality , another Big Six group , was to join people in the women 's movement to the civil rights movement .

" I thought if they had a pig in their backyard , no one could push them around , " says Height . In the ' ' 80s and ' ' 90s , Height and the NCNW embraced such issues as AIDS education and the Black Family Reunion-annual festivals in nine cities celebrating traditional AfricanAmerican values .
