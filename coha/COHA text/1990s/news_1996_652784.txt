<p> KEEP it real " is a popular expression in the rap music world . It means do n't lose your edge or your anger . It means do n't forget your " homies , " the friends you grew up with and who have n't made it . <p> Angelo Ellerbee , who teaches rappers and other emerging black music stars about things like salad forks , proper language , dressing appropriately and the value of reading , says he knows the importance of keeping it real . But he also believes that reality shifts with each situation . <p> " We are all actors , " he said . " And in our daily lives , we walk onto many different stages . You ca n't say to Barbara Walters : ' Yo ! What 's up ? ' It would n't go down . " <p> Mr. Ellerbee is the founder and president of Double XXposure , a 10-year-old publicity , management and image-control company that is often described as a charm school for rap artists . And Mr. Ellerbee says it 's the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singers Mary J. Blige , Patra , Shabba Ranks and Eric B. , who , with record sales in the millions , have to be taken more seriously than they often behave . <p> RCA Sony and Uptown record labels , among others , rely on Mr. Ellerbee to return their human investments with slightly smoother edges after a 24-week course . <p> He 's often referred to in the media as the Henry Higgins of the black music world . And if much can be learned from Shaw 's " Pygmalion " about human relations and the modern social order , so can a day at Mr. Ellerbee 's office . <p> There were smoke and mirrors there on a recent Friday morning . The smoke was from the cigarettes Mr. Ellerbee was inhaling with slightly overstated grace . The mirrors , gilded , hung on the walls in a room laden with chintz and other suggestions of opulence . Mr. Ellerbee was wearing a waistcoat , ascot , vest and velvet slippers with embroidered crowns . If necessary , he could have changed into the construction boots , baggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like people to feel comfortable around me , " Mr. Ellerbee , 38 , said . " I dress so people can relate . I 'm going to a school next week in East Orange , and I already picked out the black jumper I 'm going to wear . The kids will think it 's phat , so they 'll listen to me when I tell them not to do drugs . " <p> Like any good arbiter of etiquette , he knows that little things , like looking people in the eye during a conversation , can make life easier . He knows that reading is not only good for the mind , but also useful when multimillion-dollar contracts are involved . <p> " I think education is important , " said Mr. Ellerbee , who usually bills his clients $250 an hour . <p> He grew up in a housing project in Newark , attended the Fashion Institute of Technology , lived in Paris , trained at the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater in New York and worked in the publicity department of Chrysalis Records before starting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " children are being raised by children . Who 's going to teach them respect ? " <p> Mr. Ellerbee 's first client of the day was a handsome young reggae singer named Yvad ( pronounced ee-VAHD ) , who lives in rural Jamaica and recently signed with the Tuff Gong record label . Yvad would be getting a second dose of Mr. Ellerbee 's " interviewing technique " class before heading out for 10 press interviews later in the afternoon . <p> " Here 's the situation , " Mr. Ellerbee said to Yvad , who was sitting face to face with a staff member who had assumed the role of a monstrously critical journalist . <p> " Your job is to make him love you , " Mr. Ellerbee told the singer . " Not your music  --  you . You 're going to make a friend by turning this interview into a conversation . You 're not going to play into his negativeness . You 're going to play over it . " <p> Mr. Ellerbee clapped his hands like an old-time Hollywood director , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appealingly languid posture , was n't aggressive enough to talk over anybody . He 's a listener , given to long pauses and stroking his goatee while thinking . <p> It would n't do . <p> " Do n't think about the question , just answer it , " Mr. Ellerbee yelled at one point . <p> " You look so bored ! " he interupted seconds later , as he yanked a big mirror off the wall . " You have to show some excitement ! I 'm going to hold this mirror right here so you can look at yourself and tell me what you think your facial expression is saying . Do you feel you have good eye contact ? Do you feel yourself looking out the window or at the floor ? Be honest ! " <p> Yvad looked more pained than a patient in a dentist 's chair . <p> " When I pause , " Yvad said , " it 's just because I 'm thinking . When I lower my head , it 's just a thought coming . " <p> I T would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each interview as the sale of records , " Mr. Ellerbee said . " Let 's say 500 units . This interview could be a platinum record for you . " <p> Yvad nodded . He may come from a highly spiritual culture , but he also understands record sales . After a few more harangues from Mr. Ellerbee , it was time for him to go off and meet some real press . <p> " I do n't want to hear from anybody after your interviews today that you 're shy , " Mr. Ellerbee told the singer . " Look them dead in the eye and sell it like you 've never sold it before . " <p> Yvad , who believes that his music comes from the spirit within and that his work is just a part of " the Father 's wish , " smiled . <p> " All right , " Yvad said , as he walked out of the office . " One love . " <p> " One love , " Mr. Ellerbee replied . <p> Nothing is new under the show business sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable of stars clothed and groomed to reflect the good life as he saw it , Berry Gordy set up a finishing school at his Motown Records . There , under the direction of Maxine Powell , Marvin Gaye improved his walk and learned to keep his eyes open when he sang . The Supremes , three young women from a Detroit housing project , learned to shimmy in a nonvulgar way and to look happy , not pained , when they sang . <p> Mr. Gordy 's goal was to make his stable of artists acceptable to white , middle-class America . Although Mr. Ellerbee believes every artist should be able to dine with the Queen of England and the chief executive of Sony , not to mention Barbara Walters , his etiquette training is often about harm reduction , rather than fine-tuning . <p> " Angelo takes the element of surprise away , " said Mary Moore , the publicity director for black music at RCA records , a frequent client of Double XXposure . Surprise , she said , is the behavior that new artists exhibit that sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years ago , for example , Shabba Ranks , a Grammy Award-winning reggae star , stated on network television that if God had wanted homosexuality , he would have created Adam and Steve . Mr. Ellerbee was contracted by Epic/Sony Records to work with Mr. Ranks right after that . <p> Ms. Moore knows the dangers of becoming too smooth and slick in a field in which being bad or even a criminal is n't necessarily bad for record sales . " There 's nothing wrong with a rapper being real , " she said , " as long as they 're not awful . " <p> Having been out on promotional tours with newly signed rap groups , Ms. Moore has seen awful . She 's seen singers in restaurants reject fancy meals and show up at private parties with large groups of rude friends she could n't accommodate . She 's seen rappers throw fits in hushed hotel lobbies when their rooms were n't ready . She 's seen young artists tell morning radio hosts that it 's too early to be doing an interview , then take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station . She 's seen them do all kinds of things to sabotage their careers long before they 're successful enough to be calling all the shots . <p> " I usually just tell them that they could use some work , " said Ms. Moore , whose company , RCA , signed Elvis Presley in the mid-1950 's . <p> " Elvis was the original behavior problem at RCA , " she said . <p> Mr. Ellerbee takes credit for masterminding the image make-over of Patra , the Jamaican " ragamuffin " reggae singer , who went to him in ripped jeans and departed with a penchant for Todd Oldham and Dolce &; Gabbana . Mr. Ellerbee 's time last summer with Mary J. Blige , the rhythm-and-blues singer who has two platinum albums and a terrible reputation for rudeness , ended more disconcertingly . <p> Ms. Blige left Mr. Ellerbee 's 24-week course in the fall with only seven classes to go . Not long after that , the singer was captured at her worst in a profile for Interview magazine by Veronica Webb , the supermodel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoked pot , opened a Heineken bottle with her teeth and tried to pick a fist fight with her . <p> " That interview bothered me , " Mr. Ellerbee recalled . " Does the public need to know that Mary opened a beer bottle with her teeth ? " he asked , adding that the singer should have canceled the interview if she was having a bad day . " Mary J. Blige does n't need a bodyguard at her side night and day . She needs a publicist . " <p> A T about noon , another singer whose background and demeanor are about as different from Ms. Blige 's as rap is to easy-listening music , appeared in the carefully lighted midtown offices of Double XXposure . <p> It was Rhonda Ross , an unsigned jazz singer and songwriter who also happens to be the daughter of Diana Ross and Berry Gordy . This day 's session was an image consultation . Mr. Ellerbee loaded her into a hired sedan to go shopping . <p> " I detest shopping , " said Ms. Ross , 24 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for her by a designer friend . " But I like looking good . " And she was , wearing a black ensemble of knee-length boots , miniskirt , her fiance 's coat and a turtleneck that belongs to her mother . <p> On the fifth floor of Saks Fifth Avenue , Ms. Ross and Mr. Ellerbee joined up with his creative director and an assistant . Like a little bird , Ms. Ross flitted from one item to another . Nothing appealed to her on the fifth floor , so they proceeded to the designer clothing on another floor , where prices were four times as high and Ms. Ross seemed more inspired . <p> She tried on some shoes by Chanel that Mr. Ellerbee recomended . No . <p> A shantung silk blazer by Dolce &; Gabbana . No . <p> Some lipstick . No . <p> Because she 's engaged to be married , she looked over the wedding gowns , too . <p> " Everyone says your wedding gown 's supposed to make you look like a princess , " she said . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown to make me look like I have strength . " <p> Mr. Ellerbee , who is also consulting with Laura Branigan on her image , looked a little cowed by Ms. Ross . He recommended a veil . <p> " It 's very nice , " Ms. Ross said politely . " But it 's too billowy . I 'm having something made that 's more like a crown . " <p> Back in the car , Ms. Ross , who purchased nothing , said she enjoyed herself . " Another hard day of shopping and entourage , " she said . <p> Mr. Ellerbee laughed . He often finds himself on shopping excursions with recently wealthy , poorly educated post-adolescents who do n't know what they want or want the wrong things , and he seemed deeply grateful for the taste and manners of Ms. Ross . <p> " Rhonda , " he said at his office , after saying goodbye to her , " is very rare . " <p> Then he let out a little sigh and turned his attention back to thinking about all
