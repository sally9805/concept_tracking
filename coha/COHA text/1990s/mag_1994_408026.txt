MARILYN CALLS FOUR - year - old Christopher to come downstairs : it 's time for their trip to the bank . He arrives wearing a pair of underpants on top of his track pants and a long blue towel draped around his neck . Oh , Christopher , you ca n't come to the bank dressed like that , " she protests . Her son glares at her . " I 'm not Christopher , I 'm Superman . " So Superman goes to the bank with his mother , chattering all the way there about the children he 'd saved from an earthquake the day before and the places he 'll fly to after they are finished at the bank . Marilyn smiles when she tells the story . " He 's certainly got an active imagination , " she says . That description could fit most preschoolers . This is the age when pretending , roleplaying and other forms of imaginative play take precedence over most other activities . As Toronto child psychotherapist Jacqui Gajewski explains , " Play is the natural medium of expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the way an adult might , so instead they play it out . " She describes a number of different things that kids learn through pretending . " Preschoolers watch what other people are doing and imitate them in an attempt to assimilate what they are seeing  --  they play at being other people . This is how they learn about social roles and begin to understand the perspective of other people . " A child might come home from a visit to the doctor and proceed to immunize all his dolls and stuffed animals . Another might spend the day after she 's attended a wedding , organizing friends and toys into a wedding party while she takes on the role of the minister . Children often switch roles back and forth , " adds Gajewski . " If two children are playing mother and baby , the one who is being the mother may switch over to being the baby after a little while . They 're just trying things out . " She explains that these experiments with other roles are an important part of the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand who they are , how they differ from other people , and what they might potentially become . Imaginative play helps them find answers to these questions . As well , pretend play can help a child work through inner conflicts and stressful situations . " A typical example , " says Gajewski , " is the three - year - old who has a new baby in the family . She might play with a baby doll and pretend that a bad man comes and takes the baby away . Then Superman or a good fairy arrives and rescues the baby . " This kind of play expresses the child 's ambivalent feelings about the baby  --  anger and resentment that the baby is taking up so much of her parents ' time and attention , mixed with love and affection for this tiny new person . Those feelings are never fully resolved , so the scenario may be played out over and over again in different ways . Because imaginative play is so important to preschoolers , it 's worth the effort for parents to create an environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gajewski urges parents never to censor their children 's play . " Parents may feel very uncomfortable if they see their child playing very aggressively , perhaps hitting a doll or having all kinds of tragedies happen to the teddy bear . They 'll say " Oh , come on , play nice . " But that causes the child 's anger to go underground  --  he needs to be allowed to play out both good and bad feelings . " To encourage play , parents can take part in their child 's pretending games . Their participation , though , should be at the child 's invitation and should follow his lead . " Remember it 's his game , not yours . Let him take you into the scenarios he needs to play out . " Gajewski finds that reading aloud to children  --  especially fairy tales and fantasy stories  --  helps to develop this playful imagination . Keeping plenty of props around , such as old clothes ( shirts , hats , purses , aprons , etc. ) and play furniture and equipment ( cradles , pots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may provide the spark that sets off " Let 's pretend . " Children also enjoy using dolls , small play figures , and puppets in their play . Animal puppets are especially popular with three - to five - year - olds , but imaginative kids will play with almost anything . I 've watched my children have long conversations with a family of bath sponges , seen Ninja Turtle figures take on the roles of doctors and teachers , and listened while the mommy potato explained to the baby potato that they ca n't go outside because it 's raining . Parents sometimes do n't realize how important this kind of play is for children , " Gajewski concludes . It may seem less " productive " than activities that focus on learning numbers , shapes , or letters , but in fact children learn a great deal from imaginative play . And the best contribution parents can make is to create an accepting atmosphere where their preschoolers can give their imaginations free rein  --  and that means sometimes making trips to the bank with Superman . <p>  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
