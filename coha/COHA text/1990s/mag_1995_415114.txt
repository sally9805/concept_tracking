Rudi 's pots are enhanced by eroded patterns from nature  --  abstracted porcelain lashes which link us with his Hans Hofmann days  --  or they contain messages and memorials to friends as script incised in hidden crevices or on the body of the pot . His career spans over 60 years , from his stoneware vases full of the spirit of New Orleans circa 1935 to the mystical Light Gatherers of the late 20th century . " My introduction to the man and his work occurred over four decades ago , when he was teaching at the Tyler School of Art . It was professionally renewed in the early 60s , when the Light Gatherers first appeared . Rudi 's remarkable ability to give without imposing his singular aesthetic and spiritual position has always amazed me . He offers a subtle contrast to the circle of potters who were influenced by Abstract Expressionism .

I happened upon Aileen Webb 's America House , at 485 Madison Avenue , and discovered that it was sponsored by the recently formed American Craftsmen 's Cooperative Council ( eventually the American Craft Council ) , and that its purpose was to expose crafts as an important contribution to the contemporary art scene . It was exciting to me that the gallery/shop was exhibiting high-temperature , fire-eating stoneware by craftspeople of a kind I had previously known only through historical exhibitions in museums . How I wanted to be a part of the group I most admired at that time . My career has now come full circle , from a wishful thought in 1945 to the fulfillment of this recognition a half century later . This award has completed the circle . I am deeply thankful to ACC and to all my peers who supported me through the decades . The honor gives distinction to my life 's work .

" AWARD OF DISTINCTION ARROWMONT SCHOOL OF ARTS AND CRAFTS A true southern institution , the Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts traces its roots to 1912 , when the Pi Beta Phi sorority founded a Settlement School in Gatlinburg , Tennessee , to provide education and health care to southern Appalachian families . To promote the revival and preservation of native mountain crafts , the school gave instruction to local artisans and established the Arrowcraft Shop as an outlet for their products . But the official start of Arrowmont ( the name refers to the sorority 's symbol , an arrow ) was in 1945 , the year Pi Beta Phi joined with the University of Tennessee , Knoxville , to begin a program of summer craft workshops , which became the present-day school .

The school continues to evolve and grow , as plans proceed for the construction of a major woodworking studio complex . CRAFT AND FOLK ART MUSEUM Thirty years ago in Los Angeles , Edith Wyle opened The Egg and The Eye , a gallery/ restaurant specializing in folk art and contemporary crafts . " I had the idea , " she recently recalled , " that if a beautiful pot was put on a pedestal , the people looking at it would know and understand the art of it . I knew then , in 1965 , that the gallery should become a museum to preserve the objects we were exhibiting .

" I invited the best teachers I could find , " says Chihuly . " I knew the best teachers would attract the best students . The coming together of creative people gave Pilchuck its excitement and energy . It still does . " Today the campus , with award-winning architecture set on 64 wooded acres , is a magnet and catalyst for artists from around the world , many of whom have settled in the Seattle area and turned it into a hub of contemporary glass .

USIA ARTS AMERICA For over 15 years , the Arts America Program , an Office of the United States Information Agency 's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs , has showcased " the excellence , creativity , vitality , diversity , and democratic quality of the arts in the United States " by sending exhibitions , performing groups and cultural specialists to virtually every country in the world , especially to places where access to American art and culture is limited . Crafts have had a significant presence in this endeavor . Among the 25 craft and folk art exhibitions Arts America has circulated abroad are " American Porcelain : New Expressions in an Ancient Art " ( 1983-84 ) , " Good as Gold : Alternative Materials in American Jewelry " ( 1984-85 ) , " Art to Wear " ( 1984-86 ) , " Afro-American Quilts " ( 1985-86 ) , " Frontiers in Fiber : The Americans " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1989-93 ) , " Out of the Woods : Turned Wood by American Craftsmen " ( 1993-97 ) , and " Tell Me a Story : Narrative Art in Clay and Glass " ( 1994-95 ) . Robin Berrington , director of Arts America , cites the key role played by program officer Evangeline J. Montgomery : " A number of program officers and office directors have been involved in these projects over the years , but the one who stands out because of her expertise and dedication to crafts is E. J. Montgomery . She has worked with a number of organizers in all parts of the United States to present a wonderful series of exhibitions of fiber arts , ceramics , glass and wood in Europe and Asia . We are fortunate to have such a creative and conscientious artist and administrator as part of the U.S. Information Agency .

Through its educational programs , such as the Dominick Labino Lecture , the Hilbert Sosin Fund for Professionalism in the Glass Arts and the GAS Journal , it has promoted scholarship and raised standards . " The legacy of GAS is a legacy of friendship , support , hope , struggle , hard work , sacrifice , joy , disappointment , experimentation , challenge , success and , most importantly community , " Robert Carlson , the group 's current president , reflected on the occasion of its silver anniversary .

" Throughout one 's career , encouragement and recognition are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued commitment to a particular point of view .

Yet more important for me , I realize , is that by being named an ACC Fellow I am , in fact , not being recognized by my peers but by my teachers , mentors and guides . This is clearly an honor . " As a college fine arts major , I turned from painting and sculpture to craft because of the people I encountered as I pursued a curiosity about clay and fire . The potters , weavers and jewelers I met were individuals with a philosophy , not just a product . The philosophical and aesthetic debate I discovered then was genuinely inspiring . The values were important . Craft for me became a teaching  --  a way to live a life . The career came along .

If I could be a part of any tradition ACC seeks to continue , I would elect to help in the effort to transfer into the future the legacy of craft values and philosophy that have given my life and work their inspiration .
