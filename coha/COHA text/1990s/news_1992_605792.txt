<p> Last March , Owen George Francis , of the Bronx , N.Y. , drove to Virginia for a firearms shopping spree . On his first stop , court records show , he dropped by a Division of Motor Vehicles branch and applied for the pass that allowed him to buy firearms in the state : a Virginia driver 's license . <p> Giving a false Fairfax County address , Francis , 23 , got a license with no questions asked . A few hours later at the Metro Pawn Shop in Woodbridge , he flashed his new license as proof of residence and walked out with three powerful Davis .380-caliber semiautomatic pistols . <p> Then , according to court records , he stopped by the Woodbridge Gold and Jewelry Shop , where he bought two Davis .32-caliber handguns  --  weapons he could resell in New York for two or three times the retail price . <p> The purchases appeared legal because Francis produced a valid driver 's license when he filled out the firearms purchase forms . An instant criminal background check required by Virginia gun laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Authorities say the ease with which Francis illegally purchased guns for transport across state lines vividly illustrates a major problem with the state 's gun laws and is one of the reasons Virginia now ranks as a major culprit in the nation 's thriving black market for illegal weapons . <p> Obtaining a driver 's license in Virginia is no easier than it is in the District or Maryland , neither of which requires proof of residence . But Virginia 's gun laws bring a new dimension to the process . <p> The state is the only place in the Washington area where weapons can be bought , in most places , on the same day a purchaser secures a driver 's license . In the District , handgun sales are outlawed ; in Maryland , purchasers must wait seven days while state police conduct a background check . <p> A few Virginia jurisdictions , including Alexandria and Fairfax County , have three-day waiting periods while gun purchase applications are reviewed by local police , and Arlington has an indefinite wait before weapons can be obtained . <p> Although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had little effect on the total number of guns flowing out of Virginia , principally from counties along the Interstate 95 corridor , statistics show . <p> In recent years , Virginia has been the No. 1 source of guns confiscated by police in the District and New York City and the third-leading source of guns found in Boston , according to statistics from the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms . In the District , guns bought in Virginia accounted for 41 percent of the illegal firearms confiscated by police last year . <p> " We know that I-95 is a drugs and guns pipeline . People look for places where they can buy guns with the least amount of hassle . Virginia has a reputation of being one of those places , " said Tom Hill , an ATF spokesman . <p> As state and federal officials grapple with the problem , they are looking with increasing scrutiny at the driver 's licensing process . Some authorities said they believe that making it more difficult to obtain a license by requiring proof of residence would result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyer shows a driver 's license , the scrutiny by most Virginia gun dealers ceases , according to David Troy , who heads ATF 's Washington field office . <p> Buying a gun in Virginia " is no more difficult than getting a book in a public library , " Troy said . " No other ID is required , and generally no other questions are asked . There is no requirement on their part to check out the validity of the license . If you have the license , the money  --  you have the gun and you are out the door . " <p> The ease with which licenses can be obtained is " a major hole and it is a tragic hole , " said Richard Cullen , U.S. attorney for Virginia 's Eastern District , whose office routinely prosecutes cases involving out-of-state residents accused of buying guns with phony Virginia licenses . " And if it 's not plugged , then we are going to lose more lives . " <p> In one case handled by Cullen 's office , D.C. resident John Delbert Moore used a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine trips to an Alexandria gun store . The weapons included eight 9mm pistols and three that were very similar to an Uzi submachine gun , according to court records . <p> His false driver 's license showed a residence at an address on Gordon Boulevard in Woodbridge . When ATF agents began investigating Moore 's gun purchases , they traced the address to the Virginia Turf and Equipment Supply Co. , which had been at that location for 15 years . <p> Moore was convicted of making false statements and sentenced to one year in federal prison . The guns were never located . <p> Last March 23 , Michael Keith Archer used a Virginia operator 's license with a Norfolk address to buy a Ruger model P-85 9mm semiautomatic pistol , a Glock .40-caliber semiautomatic and a Glock 9mm from the Triangle Reloading Bench in Prince William County , court records show . Archer actually was from Brooklyn , N.Y . <p> ATF discovered the false address when it began investigating Archer 's multiple gun purchases . A woman living at the Norfolk address said she had never heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught up with Archer when he returned to Virginia to buy six more weapons . His car was stopped by authorities as he traveled through Maryland on I-95 . The weapons were taken from the car 's trunk , and Archer was arrested and later convicted of making false statements to gun dealers and sentenced to 30 days in jail and one year 's probation . <p> Recently , Cullen began to push for a law that would require the Division of Motor Vehicles to insist on proof of residence before issuing driver 's licenses . Last month , Cullen met with motor vehicle officials to seek legislative changes . But the officials , insisting that such a law would be too hard to enforce , have rejected the change . <p> Cullen said he will ask the administration of Gov . L. Douglas Wilder to introduce the change during the current session of the General Assembly , and O. Randolph Rollins , deputy director of the office of public safety , has been responsive to the concept . <p> Cullen also plans to work with the Bureau of Alcohol , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to urge them to look for warning signs , such as " a guy trying to buy guns the same day he got a license . " <p> Federal law provides that a gun dealer generally may sell a handgun to a person unless the merchant " has reasonable cause to believe the buyer does not reside in the state in which the dealer 's business is located . " <p> Dan Byers , Virginia 's administrator for driver 's licenses , said the proof-of-residence requirement is a complex issue . " With the mobile society that we have today , it 's almost impossible to have a database that keeps track of all addresses , " Byers said . He said it is impossible for motor vehicles personnel " to maintain knowledge of all the streets in a given area . " <p> In Northern Virginia , for example , the thoroughfares are numerous and there are many new communities popping up all the time , Byers said . " We try to make a reasonable effort to make sure that the person is who they say they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a driver 's license is not proof of residency . " <p> But authorities said the phony license scam is almost impossible to detect unless agents are tipped off in advance or guns from illegal purchases start showing up at crime scenes . <p> In the Francis case , ATF began investigating him in mid-March of last year after they noticed he had been making multiple purchases of firearms . They quickly determined that Francis never received mail at the address on Americana Drive that he listed on the license . They traced his real address to Barker Avenue in the Bronx . <p> Authorities had only a short wait before Francis returned to Virginia . <p> On March 24 , Francis arrived at the Gun Shoppe on Jefferson Davis Highway in Woodbridge in a 1982 blue Ford van . He purchased three Davis .380-caliber pistols . Within hours , Francis rode to Virginia Guns in Stafford County , where he bought another Davis .380 . <p> Soon afterward , Francis headed north on I-95 , with ATF agents trailing a short distance behind . After the van made its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police stopped Francis . The guns were hidden behind paneling in the roof of the vehicle . <p> Francis was convicted in July of using a false driver 's license to buy guns and sentenced to 60 days in jail and two years ' probation . Unfortunately , Troy said , there are a lot of people like
