At No. 4 Staraya Ploshchad , strollers stare in wonder at the blank windows and locked doors of the vast gray building that is the headquarters of the vanishing Soviet Communist Party . Laughter and cheers erupt as a 5-year-old boy , encouraged by his father , urinates on the wall . A graffitist has scrawled DOSHLI ( We 've come this far )  --  the slogan of Soviet soldiers fighting to victory over Germany in World War II . <P> That building until last week was the mighty , monolithic power center of a party that had run the country for more than 70 years using a combination of ruthless terror and plodding bureaucracy . Like party offices all across the country , it was shut down after the failure of the attempted coup , its assets frozen and its employees out on the street . Mikhail Gorbachev resigned as its leader and the national parliament suspended its activities . <P> " Within an hour of the presidential order there was no one to talk to anymore , " said Vladimir Gubarev , an editor at Pravda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended on Aug. 23 and failed to appear for the first time since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution . " There is no one in the Central Committee Secretariat . No one in the Politburo . They all fled like mice . " <P> The disappearance of the party and its minions was all the more stunning because it had been so ubiquitous in Soviet life . Its 300,000 apparatchiks , backed by a party-cell structure embracing 15 million rank-and-file members , supervised everything from kindergartens to strategic nuclear rocket forces . Advancement to the upper levels of politics , industry , army and intellectual life was virtually impossible without party membership . The party owned 5,254 administrative buildings , 3,583 newspapers and 23 resorts and sanatoriums . Its cash assets last week were put at about 4.5 billion rubles . But as last week demonstrated , there was a hollowness behind the bland facade of power . Eaten away by corruption , nepotism , privilege and old age , the party could not stand up to the storm of glasnost and the hammering of perestroika .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
