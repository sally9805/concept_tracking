<p> During his re-election campaign last July , President Clinton announced sweeping changes in meat and poultry inspection that would " give families the security to know that the food they eat is as safe as it can be . " <p> More than a year later , critics both inside and outside the government say the program has been oversold . <p> New scientific methods to spot microscopic killers and new monitoring systems at the nation 's 6,200 slaughterhouses and processing plants were aimed at eliminating outbreaks of food-borne disease . But a close examination of the new regulations and interviews with U.S. agriculture department officials , food experts and government inspectors reveal the program falls far short of Clinton 's promise . <p> Much-hyped bacterial testing will be used on only a small percentage of meat , and high levels of contamination will continue to be permitted in some products , officials say . Government and industry inspectors are unclear about what their jobs will be just three months before the program goes into effect in late January . <p> And the job of monitoring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that process it , angering department inspectors who say they will become little more than paper shufflers . <p> Despite the new regulations , which were drafted by the Agriculture Department and approved by Clinton , government officials remain powerless to recall tainted meat or fine violators . Recognizing the weakness in the plan , Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman goes before Congress today to repeat his requests for more authority to enforce safety . <p> " We are changing the way we regulate based on the company setting up its own systems , " he says . " We need the authority to hold them accountable . " <p> Critics warn that Clinton 's claims of quick improvements create a dangerous complacency about food safety at a time when the number and severity of food-borne illnesses is rising . <p> " It gives the impression that you can guarantee an infectious agent is not there , and you ca n't , " says Michael Osterholm , Minnesota state epidemiologist , who serves on an advisory board for the Agriculture Department . <p> Traditional ' poke and smell ' giving way <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat , inspectors for the Department of Agriculture monitor operations at the 2,700 facilities where animals are slaughtered and at another 3,500 processing plants where meat is turned into products like hamburger or chicken parts . Large plants have resident inspectors ; smaller ones are visited on a daily basis . <p> USDA inspectors traditionally check for disease by eyeballing carcasses for tumors , tuberculosis and other diseases . This " poke and smell " style will be replaced with a system that uses microscopes and petri dishes to spot dangerous organisms . <p> Tougher measures began last January , when all slaughterhouses began testing for a generic form of E. coli , bacteria that indicate fecal contamination . Beginning this January , USDA inspectors also will test for salmonella , the bacteria responsible for a major percentage of food poisoning cases . <p> The new year will mark a more radical change . Company employees will take over some responsibility to monitor health and safety in 314 of the largest slaughterhouses and processing plants . Those plants are responsible for 75% of all slaughter and 50% of all meat processing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt the new system over the next two years at a cost the industry estimates at $ 80 million . <p> The new testing program " moves us beyond what is seen , " says Tom Billy , head of the USDA 's Food Safety Inspection Service . " It gives us the ability to look with greater depth at a plant 's sanitary operation . . . . It will bring a discipline to the food production business that has n't existed before . " <p> But among the concerns : <p>  --  Only a scant percentage of meat is now checked for E. coli . Thousands of smaller slaughterhouses are required to test only 13 samples a year . <p>  --  The new testing program does n't look for E. coli 0157:H7 , a rare but dangerous strain that was behind the summer 's massive hamburger recall . In contrast , fast-food companies demand meat suppliers regularly test for the lethal bug . <p>  --  The new regulations permit high levels of contamination in some cases . For instance , a plant is considered safe if as many as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Agriculture officials have never been able to mandate the recall of tainted meats or to fine plants that fail to meet standards . And the new regulations do n't expand their powers . <p> " The Highway Safety Administration can recall dangerous products and we ca n't , " says Glickman . <p> Glickman 's inspectors are angry and anxious about the new system . They say it transfers some of their oversight responsibilities to companies , a move they say opens the door to abuse . And while new rules take effect in January , training to teach inspectors their new duties is just beginning . <p> " The packers claim they can police themselves but in my mind , it 's like putting the fox out there to guard the hen house , " says Charles Limoges , an Iowa USDA inspector . <p> Despite the gaps , the system still could work . Critics say meat quality and safety will improve if the USDA follows through on fine-tuning after all rules take effect in 2000 . <p> As long as 12 years ago , organizations like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the nation monitors its food . After years of negotiations between the government , consumer groups and the meat and poultry industries , the new rules were agreed on , written by Agriculture Department staff and then approved by Clinton . Glickman says the rules " should raise consumer confidence knowing we are modernizing our standards . " <p> But in the short term , consumer advocates warn it is too early to claim success . Says Caroline Smith DeWaal of the Center for Science in the Public Interest : " Everyone 's optimistic that they are going to make a big difference , but we really wo n't know for several years . " <p> 100% guarantee an impossibility <p> Any debate over food safety forces an uncomfortable truth on producers , regulators and consumers alike : Short of testing every bite of your dinner , there is no way to ensure dangerous bacteria are not in your food . Bacteria , from the benign to the dangerous , live in the guts of all warm-blooded animals . When they are slaughtered , there is always risk of contamination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily eliminated if meat is properly handled and cooked . But consumer advocates say the government has a responsibility to keep risk to a minimum . " A cooking error should n't be a death sentence , " DeWaal says . <p> The call for greater government oversight is bolstered by a rise of food-borne diseases over the past 20 years . Incidents of salmonella infections , including a new drug-resistant strain , have doubled in two decades . E. coli 0157:H7 , first discovered in 1982 , now is blamed for as many as 20,000 illnesses and 500 deaths annually , including a 1993 outbreak that killed four youngsters and sickened thousands who ate tainted burgers . <p> It is estimated that food-borne disease strikes between 6.5 million and 81 million people each year and kills as many as 9,000 . Scientists say the dangers will increase with changes in the food business . <p> The hamburger you bite into today may come from parts of 80 different cows . That means a small batch of bad meat can create widespread chaos , as it did this summer when 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The very nature of food processing is vulnerable to new pathogens , " says Mitchell Cohen of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . <p> Fast-food standards tighter <p> The nation 's 600 largest slaughterhouses are required to sample only one out of 300 beef carcasses and one out of 22,000 chickens . The remaining 2,000 smaller facilities need only check one carcass a week for three months to meet the annual standard . <p> Testing is not required at processing plants that do not slaughter animals , a loophole consumer advocates fear will leave the nation vulnerable to repeats of this summer 's hamburger recall . <p> In fact , the fast-food industry has tighter standards for its burgers . <p> Nearly ruined by the 1993 outbreak in the Northwest , Jack-in-the-Box now requires meat suppliers to test the production line for E. coli 0157:H7 every 15 minutes . David Theno , vice president for quality assurance and product safety , says Jack-in-the-Box pays less than a extra penny per pound of ground beef . <p> But officials say the testing is not being done to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to keep contamination levels within standards set by an nationwide survey of sanitary conditions at slaughterhouses and processing plants . <p> Key to the change is a quality control technique called Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point . Developed to monitor astronauts ' meals , HACCP shifts attention from the health of the individual meat product to the health of the production line . <p> A HACCP plan for a processing plant may establish criteria for the way meat grinders are kept clean . Key microbial " kill points , " where meat is cooked , frozen , cut or washed are identified ; standards are set for variables like time , temperatures and testing . <p> The company keeps records on operations of the key points , which will be reviewed by federal inspectors to make sure the companies keep to their own standards . <p> While the new HACCP system has been praised for its scientific approach , some fear the emphasis on record review diminishes the oversight of federal inspectors . <p> " HACCP represents a shift from monitoring the meat to monitoring the paperwork , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poultry safety at USDA who now runs the Community Nutrition Institute . <p> Dave Evans , a USDA inspector in Colorado , is troubled by the changes he 's seen . " We 've already seen some plants that fail one beef for every 13 the USDA inspectors would fail , " he says . " It is impossible for them to do an impartial job . " <p> Bill Smith , head of field operations for the inspection service , says many of the inspectors ' complaints are due to anxiety . <p> " It 's a significant culture and mindset shift , " he says . <p> Those who fight food-borne disease on a daily basis remain pessimistic that any changes in the inspection system can stem the rise of food-borne disease . <p> Osterholm , the Minnesota epidemiologist , sees food-related illness reports each day . He talks of other methods to combat contamination , including irradiation of some foods . <p> " Microbes are . . . a reality you have to deal with , " he says . " Even with the best of inspection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't remove it . "
