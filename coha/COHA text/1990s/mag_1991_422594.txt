1931 - BILL GRAHAM - 1991 <p> THE MUSICAL NOTES seemed to hang in the air of the synagogue , each one dripping with the sorrow and heartache felt by those who had known Bill Graham . Guitarist Carlos Santana was weeping as he played the melody of one of Graham 's favorite pieces of music , a Tin Pan Alley tune from the Forties called I Love You Much Too Much . ' <p> For Bill Graham , who for more than thirty years stood at the side of the stage watching the stars of rock &; roll perform , there was no more fitting eulogy . And there was no one better suited to play it than Santana , an artist Graham had first presented at the Fillmore in the late Sixties , an artist he had managed for many years , an artist who shared his love of both Latin music and jazz . Rabbi Robert Kirschner , who conducted Graham 's funeral service , called Santana 's performance the most beautiful benediction we have ever heard in this synagogue . ' <p> Nearly 2000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday morning . Three days earlier , on Friday , October 25th , Graham ( who was sixty ) , Melissa Gold ( a former script supervisor for Zoetrope studios and Graham 's live-in companion of the past few years ) and Steve Kahn ( a friend and employee for almost two decades ) had been killed in a helicopter crash as they headed back to the promoter 's Marin County estate from a Huey Lewis and the News concert at the Concord Pavilion , about forty miles inland from San Francisco . <p> Backstage at that show , Graham had talked about how driving rain and winds had whipped his Bell Jet Ranger on the way out to the amphitheater . But even though some of his associates at Bill Graham Presents ( BGP ) , his concert-promotion company , had offered to drive him home , Graham opted to return in the helicopter . At about 10:00 p.m. the copter , piloted by Kahn , collided with a 200-foot-tall electrical-transformer tower alongside Highway 37 , near Vallejo . Graham and his two companions were thrown out and died instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concert promoters and booking agents , record executives and managers , former Graham employees dating back to the early Fillmore days and current BGP personnel . And of course , many members of San Francisco 's rock &; roll community were present . Jerry Garcia , Mickey Hart and Phil Lesh of the Grateful Dead were there . So were members of the Jefferson Airplane , one of the first groups Graham had booked at the Fillmore Auditorium . And Big Brother and the Holding Company . And Quicksilver Messenger Service . And John Fogerty . And Huey Lewis and the News . <p> During the service two of Graham 's closest musician friends - Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart and Jefferson Airplane founding member Paul Kantner - spoke somberly about their relationships with Graham . But perhaps the most emotional moment of the funeral came when Graham 's sister Ester Chichinsky , standing at the podium , pounded on her breast and cried out : Bill , you will always be with us in our heart . In my soul . Thank you for loving us and enhancing my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least 200 cars and limousines drove through San Francisco and out to the memorial park where Graham was to be buried . As two Harley-Davidsons going in the opposite direction passed the limos , the bikers honked and raised their fists . <p> A short while later about 500 people stood around the grave site . The rabbi said a eulogy , and David Graham , one of the promoter 's sons , dropped to his knees and kissed the coffin . After the coffin was lowered into the ground , the mourners each threw in a handful of dirt . Then David ; Graham 's other son , Alex ; and Graham 's stepson , Thomas , filled in the grave . Later , up at Masada , Graham 's Marin estate , the wake began . <p> <p> BILL GRAHAM would laugh mightily to see us all here today saying good things about him , ' Paul Kantner said during his eulogy . And indeed , Graham was used to being attacked . Once , when asked what made him happy , Graham said , Not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure in being the martyr , in being the guy who , in spite of what anyone said or thought about him , not only survived but flourished . <p> Bill Graham loved to argue . He spent nearly as much time defending himself against his critics as he did putting on concerts . To imagine Bill Graham not arguing with some fan or journalist about how he 'd been misunderstood or slighted was impossible . Many a journalist who dealt with Graham has at least one tale of clashing with him and being unceremoniously escorted out of a concert hall . You heap of crawling maggots , ' he once shouted at a writer who he felt had wronged him in print . <p> Over the years , one could always find Graham standing outside a club or auditorium , engaged in a shouting match with some fan about high ticket prices . Graham never seemed to get over the fact that although it was the artists and their managers and agents who set the ticket prices , he was the one who took the heat . Yet he understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he would say . I was n't . I was a businessman . ' <p> Right up to the end , Graham remained sensitive to accusations that he was , as he put it , a capitalist pig rip-off . ' <p> The minute somebody starts attacking me in that area , something happens to me , ' Graham said during a ROLLING STONE interview in 1985 . I 'm like a cobra whose head is rising and ssss . . . . ' <p> Even with his closest friends , Graham liked to argue . He loved a good fight , ' said Michael Klenfner , a music-industry consultant who was a close friend of Graham 's for more than two decades . He 'd call me up at midnight and start in . We 'd be at it till 2:30 in the morning . I 'd say to him , Bill , what are you doing ? Just keeping in practice ? ' ' <p> Klenfner , like many who knew Graham , is now finding it difficult to accept the fact that his friend is gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured Graham would outlast them . <p> This was the impossible , something nobody imagined , ' said Nick Clainos , president of BGP and a man who worked closely with Graham for years . The man was so invincible . ' <p> Certainly , it seemed that way . For three decades , Bill Graham ruled live rock &; roll . It was n't simply that he was on a first-name basis with just about every important rock star . He was one of the few people in the music business who could hold his own with any of them and who , in his own right , was their equal . <p> Graham epitomized the tough-talking concert promoter . He was a street-smart negotiator who worked every angle . He could charm you ; he could badger you . He did whatever he had to do to cinch a deal . As he once told a friend , My secret is always make ' em think you 're crazy , that you 'll do anything . ' <p> Graham did n't simply stage thousands of rock concerts . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really earned his reputation by putting together extraordinary benefits and rock events on almost a yearly basis . <p> It was Graham who presented the peace concert in the Soviet Union on July 4th , 1987 . On short notice he managed to transport top-quality production equipment to Moscow , where he presented Santana , the Doobie Brothers , James Taylor and Bonnie Raitt . It was Graham who took Bob Dylan and the Band across America in 1974 for a barnstorming arena tour that stands as a highlight of Dylan 's career . Graham also promoted acclaimed national tours for Crosby , Stills , Nash and Young in 1974 and for the Rolling Stones in 1981 . ( So close was Graham 's relationship with the Stones that he became deeply depressed when the group chose another promoter for its Steel Wheels tour , in 1989 . ) <p> In 1975 , upset after the San Francisco school system canceled after-school sports programs because of financial problems , Graham quickly organized a benefit at the 50,000-seat Kezar Stadium featuring Dylan , the Dead and Marlon Brando . In 1976 he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail of an unforgettable concert that began with a full-course Thanksgiving dinner served to everyone at Winterland ; then the Band backed a group of rock and blues giants that included Dylan , Neil Young , Eric Clapton , Van Morrison , Muddy Waters , Dr. John and Joni Mitchell . <p> In 1985 , Graham oversaw the American portion of Live Aid , managing to cut through the music-industry bullshit and , working with Bob Geldof , convince Dylan , Keith Richards , Mick Jagger , Madonna , Led Zeppelin , Crosby , Stills , Nash and Young , and others to perform at JFK Stadium , in Philadelphia . <p> In 1986 , saddened by the growing crack epidemic , he organized a concert at New York 's Madison Square Garden that raised money for an antidrug campaign . Performers included Run-D.M.C. , Gregg Allman , Santana , Ruben Blades and Crosby , Stills and Nash . <p> Graham also organized both of Amnesty International 's tours , first taking U2 , Sting , Peter Gabriel , Bryan Adams , Lou Reed , the Neville Brothers and Joan Baez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking Bruce Springsteen , Sting , Gabriel , Tracy Chapman and Youssou N'Dour around the world in an attempt to draw attention to human-rights violations . <p> For thirty years , Graham never stopped raising money for dozens of causes , ranging from AIDS research to the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic . The week after his death he was to have met with Oakland officials to discuss a benefit he wanted to organize to help victims of the recent Oakland hills fires . <p> No matter how tightfisted a businessman Graham was , he never seemed happier than when he was harnessing the tremendous power of rock &; roll for the good of a cause . He truly seemed to delight in bringing the biggest names in pop music together to help make the world a better place , while at the same time making himself just a little bit more legendary . <p> In the early days , Graham was the short-haired guy with his feet firmly on the ground . Talk to veterans of that scene and they all re-create a picture of Graham , clipboard in hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like clockwork , cajoling some stoned guitarist out onto the stage so that the set could begin on time . He was always there at the Fillmore , ' said Country Joe McDonald , picking up trash on the floor after the show , talking to people , yelling at people , kicking people , pushing them around and schmoozing . ' <p> From the first show Graham organized - it 's not insignificant that it was a benefit for the San Francisco Mime Troupe - he made news . Graham quickly became an oft-quoted spokesman for the San Francisco scene , a scene that he did much to further in his role as plugged-in businessman . He befriended the local musicians and relied on them to advise him on hip out-of-town acts that he should also book . It was Graham who consistently presented legendary blues , jazz , soul and R &B; artists alongside the Grateful Dead , the Mothers of Invention and the like . <p> In San Francisco , young rock fans might go to Winterland to hear Cream , but they 'd leave the show as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group that Graham smartly placed on the bill . When the power structure was different , we were able to put on Howlin ' Wolf with Janis Joplin , or two one-act plays by LeRoi Jones at a Byrds concert , ' Graham said . To see the faces of Grateful Dead fans listening to Miles Davis ; to watch a roomful of really hyper Who fans being blown away by Woody Herman . Turning the houselights on , with Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles and the King Curtis band , and seeing the band go into twenty minutes of laying down this incredible beat and Aretha just holding Ray 's arm and rocking back and forth on the stage - that was . . . nirvana . ' <p> <p> HE WAS BORN WOLFGANG GRAJONCE IN Berlin on January 8th , 1931 . His father died in a construction accident two days later ; his mother placed him and his youngest sister in a Berlin orphanage so she could work . In 1939 , Graham was in Paris with other children from the orphanage as part of an exchange program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later a Red Cross representative helped Graham and sixty-three other children flee the Nazis . It was a nightmarish journey - his sister became too weak to continue and died in a hospital in Lyon , France - that eventually landed him in New York . Graham 's mother died in a Nazi concentration camp . <p> When he arrived in New York , he was eleven years old , weighed forty-four pounds and did n't speak a word of English . He and ten other orphans who had survived the trip were put in barracks run by the Foster Home Bureau . On the weekend , ' Graham told ROLLING STONE , the families would come up to these cottages , looking at us as though they were picking out a pet in a pet shop . And all of us wanted to be taken by somebody . Nine weeks passed . Finally , on the last weekend in November , a family came , a couple with a boy who was two years older than I was . . . . I was taken by them and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life was rough . As Graham explained it , he was the kid who spoke German , and Germany was the enemy . I used to get my head kicked in all the time at school , ' he recalled . They would goose-step in front of my house and say , Nazi , go home . ' ' <p> He graduated from high school and then , during the Korean War , was drafted into the army . He was court-martialed twice for minor infractions but ultimately earned the Bronze Star and Purple Heart in combat duty . <p> Graham always had a knack for working the angles . While employed in resort hotels as a teenager during the summers , he set up a check-cashing operation that earned him more than $300 a week . In the army , he operated a small-time snack service , selling fruit and sandwiches to his buddies and earning , by his reckoning , about $1400 . <p> After leaving the army , Graham returned to New York , where he worked as a cabdriver and earned a degree in business administration from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up working a string of dead-end jobs . But he had grander ambitions . He had become interested in show business , and in the late Fifties he went back to New York , studied acting and tried to break into theater . He did n't succeed , and in 1963 he returned to San Francisco . But the lure of the theater held ; he became business manager of the San Francisco Mime Troupe . When the troupe was busted on obscenity charges , a benefit show was proposed to help cover legal expenses . It fell to Graham to organize it . Later he referred to the event as the true birth of the San Francisco scene . <p> I saw and felt it on a specific night , ' he said , the first San Francisco Mime Troupe benefit , November 6th , 1965 . The Jefferson Airplane and John Handy and Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti and others performed . We expected a few hundred people ; thousands showed up . There were people with huge hats and loud colors and baggy pants and costume jewelry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their 8-mm films on the walls . We had these big barrels filled with vodka and grapefruit juice . And the response we got : My eyes were opened . There 's a new world and a new society and a new spirit . ' ' <p> Within months of that show , Graham was booking the Fillmore Auditorium three nights a week , and by 1967 he was juggling local acts like the Dead with national acts like the Doors and English combos like the Who . <p> <p> WHILE THERE WERE OTHERS IN SAN FRANCISCO who helped pioneer the contemporary rock concert , it was Bill Graham - with his ability to deal with both the extremely straight downtown politicos and the very hip artists - who made a viable business out of presenting live rock &; roll in a first-class way . <p> More than anything else , Bill gave the business legitimacy , ' said Frank Barsalona , the head of Premier Talent , which books Bruce Springsteen , U2 and numerous other artists . He treated rock acts like they were legitimate and not lucky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole structure , the sound and the lights , happened because of Bill . ' <p> In 1965 , rock concerts were typically multiact affairs - Dick Clark 's Caravan of Stars or Motown 's Motor Town Revue - in which the bill consisted of a headliner and six or seven other acts with records on the charts . Sound systems were lousy , lighting was rudimentary , and often the shows themselves had a kind of amateur-hour quality to them . <p> By the end of 1965 that began to change . A group of bohemians who called themselves the Family Dog began holding dance concerts at various halls around San Francisco . The dances were advertised with psychedelic posters . The shows featured light shows and the bands played long sets . The events went late into the night . <p> Within a few weeks of the Family Dog 's first show , Graham held his first benefit for the Mime Troupe . Quick to pick up on a winning trend , Graham jumped feet first into the concert business . He mixed the countercultural ideas that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach . <p> As time went on , local hippie promoters fell by the wayside , and Graham built a powerful organization that presented concerts three and four nights a week in both San Francisco and New York , where he had turned an old vaudeville theater into the Fillmore East . The Fillmores were shamelessly copied by others - the ballroom circuit of the late Sixties and early Seventies eventually included the Electric Factory in Philadelphia ; the Kinetic Playground in Chicago ; the Boston Tea Party ; the Palladium in Los Angeles ; and the Grande Ballroom in Detroit . <p> It all started with what he was doing at the Fillmore , ' said Tom Ross , head of the Creative Artists Agency 's music division . He was the standard that other promoters tried to live up to . ' <p> Then in 1971 , Graham shocked rock fans when he announced he was closing both the Fillmore East and the Fillmore West . At a press conference in New York a two-page , single-spaced letter was distributed . In it Graham railed against artists and agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents who packaged acts , forcing him to take artists he did n't want in order to get a choice headliner . And he felt that the audience 's taste in music had gone south . The only reason to keep the Fillmore open at this point would be to make money , and though few have chosen to believe me on this point , money has never been my prime motivation , ' Graham said . And now it would become my only motivation to continue . I pass . ' <p> In closing the Fillmores , Graham brought an end to an era . But despite his statement , he never really left the concert business . He booked shows at other venues in San Francisco and renewed his lease at Winterland - a larger hall than the Fillmore - where he had been holding more and more concerts anyway . <p> As the Seventies progressed , Graham dropped the hippie trappings - no more psychedelic posters or light shows - but he never stopped refining rock concerts . Sound systems were improved , lighting upgraded . Backstage accommodations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition to his innovations as a promoter , Graham created the modern rock &; roll merchandising business . What started with a card table set up in Winterland to sell Grateful Dead T-shirts turned into the biggest rock-merchandising company in the world , doing more than $100 million a year in business . ( Graham eventually sold the firm , Winterland Productions ; MCA is now the primary shareholder . ) <p> Along the way , Graham started record labels ( Fillmore Records and San Francisco Records ) , a catering firm ( Fillmore Fingers ) and an advertising company ( Chutzpah ) . He was the Jefferson Airplane 's manager for a while , and at the time of his death his management division handled the careers of Joe Satriani , Eddie Money , the Neville Brothers , Lynyrd Skynyrd and others . <p> In the greater Bay Area , Graham maintained a near monopoly on the concert business . His company booked and operated the Warfield , in San Francisco , as well as the Cal Expo Amphitheater , in Sacramento , and the Wiltern Theater , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubs , in San Francisco and Walnut Creek , California . And he booked shows in every size facility in the Bay Area , from the small Kennel Club to the gargantuan Oakland Coliseum . Graham also spent millions of his own dollars building the Shoreline Amphitheater , in Mountain View , California , an outdoor concert site where Bruce Springsteen , Neil Young , Don Henley , Def Leppard and hundreds of others have performed . <p> In 1985 , twenty years after producing his first concert , Graham recalled how he 'd felt and what he 'd discovered after putting on his first few concerts . I came to realize what I could do with my life , ' he said . I am not an artist . But I had found a means of expression . ' <p> But , of course , he was wrong . For Bill Graham , in his own way , was an artist . And like any artist with a truly powerful vision , Graham proceeded to impose that vision on the entire world . It 's said that you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your deeds and not tell the stories and not remember , ' said Mickey Hart at the funeral . Well , as far as I 'm concerned , Bill is n't dead , because he 'll live in each one of us , in our hearts , for as long as we live and beyond .

Every hippie and former hippie in the Bay Area was there . Performing for free were most of the Bay Area 's biggest stars , along with a few out-of-towners : Crosby , Stills , Nash and Young , the Grateful Dead , John Fogerty , Tracy Chapman , Journey , Santana , Los Lobos , Aaron Neville , Jackson Browne , Bobby McFerrin , Kris Kristofferson , Robin Williams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Band kicked things off , playing on the back of a flatbed truck and leading a stream of people around the outer edge of the Polo Field in a New Orleans-style funeral procession .

' Carlos Santana led his band through Latin-flavored jazz-rock ; Cesar Rosas and David Hidalgo of Los Lobos then joined the group for a rousing version of the Dead 's Bertha . ' <p> As the musicians played , the people just kept coming . They filled the Polo Field itself , then found observation spots among the surrounding trees and in areas adjacent to the field . Clusters of multicolored balloons hung in the sky overhead ; a plane flew by , dropping flowers onto the crowd . <p> The show just seemed to build and build . Crosby , Stills , Nash and Young , accompanied only by their guitars , gave moving readings of Teach Your Children , ' Love the One You 're With , ' Long May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross , ' Only Love Can Break Your Heart ' and Wooden Ships . ' Then brought back for an encore , Neil Young said : Bill Graham made us all look good . He gave us a chance to show you that we could do something good beyond our own careers . He kept pushing us to do things for other people and making a place available for us to do it , so there was no way out . Well , thank you , Bill . I 'm going to do this song . I do n't mean it to be a downer , but it 's one of my songs . What can I tell you ? ' With that , CSNY went into Ohio . ' <p> The Grateful Dead played with a spirit that recalled their many nights at the various ballrooms in San Francisco in the late Sixties . They recaptured much of the blues-rock sound of their earliest records in performances of I Know You Rider ' and Wang Dang Doodle . ' <p> The Dead then brought Fogerty out and blasted through Born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon Rising ' and Proud Mary , ' giving all of Fogerty 's Creedence Clearwater Revival classics a slightly strange spin . They then launched into an extended medley that moved through Truckin ' , ' The Other One , ' Wharf Rat ' and the sunshine daydream ' section of Sugar Magnolia . ' <p> Young joined them to sing a touching version of Bob Dylan 's Forever Young , ' and the Dead ended their set with Touch of Grey , ' leading the crowd in the repeated chorus of We will survive . ' <p> Finally , Joan Baez , joined by Kris Kristofferson and Graham Nash on harmony vocals , brought the day to a close with Amazing Grace .

( JAY BLAKESBERG ) <p> 1931 - BILL GRAHAM - 1991 REMEMBERING BILL <p> TABLE <p> BILL AND I WERE WAITERS in a club in Atlantic Beach together in the Fifties . I used to jerk sodas downstairs , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same reason : Tito Puente . We were both lovers of the Latin music of the Fifties in New York . That 's where we started . And it went on from there , and then through the years with the Grateful Dead - he was the chief Deadhead , you know . He was the mambo king , but he also loved the Grateful Dead and that whole scene . <p> Bill was a ruthless business fellow . He played hardball , and every game was the World Series . But he did things that most people do n't know about . He planted trees in Israel for my grandmother . He cosigned on a loan for my first car when me and Bob Weir were hitchhiking to the Fillmore . He financed the seed money for Drumming at the Edge of Magic and Planet Drum , my two books . I asked him to give me some money for this research , which took ten years , and he said : Why ? Why should I give you money for a drum book , of all things ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what else will you do with your fucking money ? ' So he gave me money for the drum books . <p> <p> TABLE <p> WE KNEW EACH other since around 1952 , when he worked as a waiter up in the mountains at the President Hotel - he worked many hotels . And we hit off a great friendship , since he was in love with Latin music . He was a very good dancer . He wanted to learn Spanish . Usually when people want to learn Spanish , if they do n't speak the language , they learn the dirty words first , and that 's what he learned . <p> I had the privilege of playing his birthday parties many years . One big one was at Roseland , in New York , and I played New Year 's Eve at Winterland and another in a big hangar - that was the last one , three or four years ago . I knew what kind of music he loved , and he would just take off and have a ball . I can see his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TABLE <p> I BELIEVE IT was around 1953 when Billy came to work at the hotel as a waiter . We got very friendly , went out once in a while together , and to me , Billy was just a crazy , fun guy . We did n't get much sleep in those days . We were always up either working or running . Billy was a decent waiter , let me put it that way . He was n't in love with that sort of work . At that time , I think , he was going to some sort of acting school , and when he was in the dining room , he used to pull out different acts . He dug the celebrities an awful lot at that time . <p> He disappeared in 1956 or ' 57 . He just took off , no one knew where or what , he just quit . Years later he came back to the dining room with his son . I saw him , and I hugged him and kissed him . He asked me if he could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mouth . <p> He and his son Davey both ate like the Russians were next door . When Billy sat down , there was n't an item we could n't get for him . He liked noodles and cottage cheese with cinnamon sprinkled on top baked together , so we always made sure we had something like that . To us , he was one of the guys , just one of the fellows that we went out with and had a good time with . <p> <p> TABLE <p> THE FIRST TIME I met Bill I was a dancer in a show , and he was auditioning . He was a young actor , and I guess he had just come out to San Francisco . He was auditioning for Big Julie in Guys and Dolls . And he caused this furor , just stopped the whole place , because he kept telling the director how to direct his part , and it was , like , the smallest part in the show , you know ? It was this little bit part , and he had one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was telling everybody how to work around him . And the director and he got into this furious battle . The director finally kicked him out , and it was a big to-do - we were all just sitting there watching this . It was like the same old Bill that he became . He always had to be in charge and look over every little thing . <p> <p> TABLE <p> BILL CHANGED the way rock evolved . Without him I would not be here . His Fillmore ballroom promotions provided a model for halls around the world in which audiences would sit , listen and applaud , as well as scream or dance . Rock became music in that process . It was not an easy progression to make , and when we first went to San Francisco to play the Fillmore in ' 67 , right after our Monterey Pop show , we argued with Bill about the way we wanted to perform and the equipment we wished to use . He proved to be right - with good-quality , cinemalike sound systems , decent conditions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we appeared twice for about an hour each time ) , we found we could really penetrate the audience . Our gimmicks - Union Jack flag jackets , destruction displays and large-scale movements - became secondary to our music . We grew from that day artistically , and we started to earn more money . <p> I once saw Bill take a man who had stolen into our show at the Fillmore East in ' 69 back to his point of entry to personally escort him out . The man had broken through a roof light on the seventh floor , backstage . As he pushed him up through the broken window back onto the roof high above the busy street , he said , Come to the front door like everyone else and I might let you in for free , you mad motherfucker . ' He turned to me and said , He 's crazy to come over the roof but discriminating - that should be rewarded . ' <p> <p> TABLE <p> THE SAN FRANCISCO SCENE at that time influenced an entire generation . But if it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never gotten out . He took something that was new and really kind of turned promoting shows into an art form . Bill did everything himself . He supervised every possible thing . I saw him sweep floors , he would arrange the chairs , he dealt with the light shows , he had the posters printed up , checked the ticket takers , the concession stand . . . . I mean everything had to be perfect . <p> The hippie community really kind of distrusted Bill in the early days . But at the Fillmore West one time , the Grateful Dead spiked him with LSD . Usually , the doors always shut at a quarter to two , that was it , lights out . They spiked him with LSD , and he kept the place open and played cowbell until about four o'clock in the morning . After that he kind of changed . <p> <p> TABLE <p> BILL GRAHAM WAS ONE OF THE TOUGHEST guys I ever met . He liked to fight ; it was a way of life for him . He was democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , big or small , public or private . Indeed , he used to provoke fights with the audience from the stage of his shows . Bill 's ability and desire to fight was the singular element that provided for the survival and growth of the San Francisco dance-concert scene of the Sixties . <p> I first met Bill when I was a student at Berkeley and an aficionado of the dance concerts put on by the Family Dog and the Acid Tests run by Ken Kesey and the Pranksters . I was taking all of it in and writing about it in the Daily Cal . <p> Bill was discovering all this at the same time and beginning to promote shows parallel to Family Dog . One weekend there might be a dance concert plus light show featuring the Grateful Dead , Howlin ' Wolf and Big Brother and the Holding Company at a small , 1500-capacity ballroom run by the hippies of the Dog , and another show , run by Bill Graham , starring the Jefferson Airplane , Muddy Waters and Quicksilver Messenger Service at a slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Bill tracked me down at the University of California campus one weekday to chew me , a student , out for some forgotten thing I 'd written . I had seen him pacing the edges of the darkened dances , but this was my first face-to-face meeting with him , posters under his arm and a staple gun in his hand . <p> He was not an easy man to get along with . He liked to be in your face . I was at one time personally barred from the Fillmore West and another time threatened with death by Bill . <p> On the other hand , if it absolutely , positively had to be done on time and done right , Bill Graham was the man to turn to . He and his company undoubtedly did more free concerts , benefits , charitable fund-raising and community work than any other performer or business people in rock &; roll . His concert productions and tours were of the absolutely highest standards . <p> He was not an easy man ; he cared more about his work than being loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> <p> TABLE <p> SHORTLY BEFORE THE WOODSTOCK FESTIVAL , the Airplane played Tanglewood , with the Who and , I believe , B.B. King . And after the show , we got back together in the hotel room , and Keith Moon was there . We went late into the night , with them getting bejabbered on various alcohols and whatever they did , and there was a tank of nitrous oxide in the room . About midway through the night , both of the bands were sort of like hanging out in the middle of the room listening to music , hanging out on the beds and whatever , and on the opposite corners of the room , catty-corner , Keith Moon was standing on one of the night tables , orating something , sounding like Long John Silver in Treasure Island , like he did a lot . And Bill Graham was on the other side of the room , standing on the opposite end table - they were going head to head . Bill and Keith Moon , face to face . An epic moment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT HIM this week . That 's the end of nighttime helicopter flight for me , baby . The first time we worked for Bill was 1969 , at Winterland . And I think for the first couple of years that I knew him , we were always hammer and tongs with each other . He was one of those guys where , if you did n't know him , he could really get up your nose . I think nearly everybody may have started kind of like that with Bill . But then slowly , as we got to work more and more together , we started to appreciate the man 's work . I mean that job that he did - it 's like more than being a general . To make a tour work and to put it all together and be able to deal with people and get the show on and everything that has to be done , you start to appreciate what an extraordinary person he was . Bill and the Stones came up at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these sort of huge tours of football stadiums . You had to improvise as you went along . So we kind of did it together . And because nobody had ever done anything on this scale before , it was kind of like experimenting every time , you never knew what was going to hit you in the face the next day . <p> He never yelled at me - I 've seen him yell at loads of other people . And it was quite an interesting sight , you know ? Bill 's having a go at so-and-so - let 's go watch ! ' But to me , he was always very polite . I think it 's because he knew he 'd get more out of me that way . <p> <p> TABLE <p> THE FIRST SHOW THE BAND EVER PLAYED was at Winterland with Bill Graham presenting us . And the last show I ever played with the Band , the Last Waltz , was at the Winterland with Bill Graham presenting us . I remember the first time I met Bill . It was around 1969 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't toured after the first album , Music From Big Pink , because Rick Danko had been in a serious accident . As a result of not touring , this incredible mystique had developed about us , which had nothing to do with us . <p> So Bill came to see us , and he seemed to have this idea that he was going to have to beg us to play . His appeal was to use the voice of the people . He kept talking about how we owed it to the people ' to play . The heaviest part was when he said something like The people 's hearts are bleeding . You must come down out of the darkness and play for the people . ' <p> On one hand , I was completely taken by this . But on the other hand , the truth was he did n't have to convince us . We were already planning on touring after the second record anyway . So as he talked about our obligation to the people , Albert Grossman , our manager , was sitting there cracking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart to tell him the truth . So I just said , Bill , how do I meet these people you speak of . ' And he said , The best place would be in the Winterland , in San Francisco - that 's where there 's the most love - and then at the Fillmore East , in New York . ' <p> Ironically , after all that , when it finally came time to play the Winterland , I was as sick as I 've ever been in my life . And as the show got closer and closer , I got worse and worse . As a last resort , Bill and Albert Grossman came up with the idea of getting this Freud hypnotist to help me . We were desperate - Bill had been talking about the people ' so long , they were like refugees in my mind , and I was n't about to let them down . So this hypnotist made it so I could n't remember how badly I felt . And it worked , for a while . He stood on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me starting to fade , he would say the word grow , and somehow it got me through the show . And the people , as it turned out , were lovely people . <p> <p> TABLE <p> OTHER PEOPLE PROMOTED SHOWS . BILL produced shows . When the Airplane played the Fillmore , there was an airplane parked out front . When Traffic played , a traffic light dropped from above the stage . When the Incredible String Band or Laura Nyro played , there would be a rose on every seat . The little things mattered . <p> And he cared about his family , his sisters . After one New Year 's Eve show with the Grateful Dead , he had a semi truck pull up , and he had all his sisters and his brother-in-law get in . In the back of the truck was a Jacuzzi , and he made them all undress and sit in this Jacuzzi after the show . And they all drank champagne and laughed . <p> He also liked to go for rides . We would get in my car and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or breakfast , for the bagels and pickled lox . Or we would go to Coney Island and walk on the boardwalk and have a kasha knish and a glass of buttermilk and watch the guys play handball . <p> He never put the top up on his car . It could be twelve degrees out . He was n't such a thrill to drive with , but he liked to drive . He only rented convertibles . Did n't care whether it was winter or summer - he liked that air . He tasted it , he ate it . <p> <p> TABLE <p> BILL USED TO HAVE A BASEBALL TEAM , and every time bands would come to town and play , they 'd play him in baseball . And one time they asked us to play . We did n't want to . They had uniforms , and they played all the time , and we had n't played in years . But we played them anyway , and they were beating us about 25-0 . We were all kind of mad at ' em , really , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , Bill made a bet with me that the loser of the game would pay for dinner for everybody . So it was the last inning , and Ronnie Van Zant got a hit and was trying to make it into a home run . The catcher caught the ball about five , ten seconds before Ronnie got to home plate , so Ronnie put his head down like a football player and just ran head into the catcher . He knocked him about fifteen feet in the air and knocked the breath out of him . Bill 's team was all ready to fight us , and it turned into a big uproar . Bill always remembered that . Every time we 'd come to town , he 'd say : Let 's play ball ! Let 's play ball ! ' <p> <p> TABLE <p> MY FIRST MEETING WITH BILL GRAHAM was very special . It was about sixteen years ago , before I joined Fleetwood Mac . I was in a group called Fritz , with Lindsey Buckingham , and I lived in San Francisco , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the set some guy was making some catcalls to me , and Bill Graham walked right out onstage and screamed at the guy and told him to get out of his Fillmore West , and never come through his doors again . Bill Graham did n't know me , and there was no reason for him to come out and stand up for me like that . And from that came Fleetwood Mac and all the times we played at the Fillmore and the Days on the Green and the US Festival . To me , Bill was the most elegant of all people that I had ever known in rock &; roll , because everything he did was perfect . Like having your name carved in wood over your dressing-room door . He was just very , very special . <p> <p> TABLE <p> HAVING HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SITTING outside his office for about twelve years and answering almost every phone call that came in , I was flabbergasted over the years to see the numbers of people that would come to Bill for help in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't heard from for fifteen or twenty years . Bill would give these people the biggest song and dance - I 'm not the Red Cross , ' and all that . But he always ended up saying yes . <p> One time David Crosby , when he was finally getting his act cleaned up after so many years , wrote Bill a letter from either a program or a hospital or something . Bill had helped him out with his lawyers , I think . And David thanked him and wrote what a great guy he was , and near the end it said something like : Do n't worry , Bill . I 'm not going to tell anybody . Would n't want to blow your image . ' And then in parentheses , Tee-hee . ' Not a week went by that he did n't do some amazing thing for somebody like that . Many times he would say , Just do n't tell anybody . ' <p> Another time , several years ago , Bill got a call from Barbra Streisand , who wanted to raise some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down to her house near L.A. , and he said to me , I know how much you love Barbra Streisand . Do you want to go ? ' And he let me go under the guise of helping him , taking notes and things . They had this most incredible meeting , and she ended up doing a private fund-raising dinner at her Malibu ranch . It was like $5000 a couple , and when Bill got the invitation , I knew he would buy a couple of tickets . He had me send in the money for the tickets , and then once he got them in his hands , he took me in his office and said , This one 's for you , Bubby , for everything you 've done for me . ' He took me down there for that , and we had the most wonderful weekend . <p> <p> TABLE <p> I REMEMBER THE PRESS CONFERENCE TO kick off the Conspiracy of Hope Tour in San Francisco , and one poor reporter started saying , Well , you people are rich in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his throat . He started screaming : What the fuck are you doing for human rights ? What have you ever done ? You 're an asshole , I know you . ' I could n't believe it . It was the first big press conference I 'd been involved in . <p> There are a lot of stories like that . I was having a battle with MTV on the closing of the Conspiracy of Hope Tour - they were telling me they could n't do this , they could n't do that . I said , Bill , they told me they would listen to me , and they 're not . ' He said : They 'll listen . Bring ' em over here . ' So I brought them over . And he was near their electrical plugs . He sat down on the ground next to the plugs and said : Look , this is Healey . You told him that you were gon na listen to him . Right ? ' And they said , Well , we ca n't , Bill , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you what - we can . Or else these plugs come out of the wall . ' And he was gon na pull them out of the wall . They said , Well , I guess we can do things that way . ' <p> <p> TABLE <p> BIG BOOMING VOICE . . . MORE OF A PERFORMER than a lot of the acts he promoted . In the early years , a great guide . We fought with him - I 'm sure a lot of people did . But we 'll miss him . He was fun . Rock &; roll has lost another great . . . actor . <p> <p> TABLE <p> WE HAD A CLOSING SHOW FOR WINTERLAND with the Grateful Dead in 1978 . We started the day , December 31st , at five in the morning with me out on the street in a little booth with a sign that said DAVID 'S SOUP KITCHEN over it , and me and my aunt Ester gave out soup and carrot cake to all the Deadheads in line , who had literally been there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each show they 'd just go get back in line . <p> In the afternoon we opened the doors , and kids rushed in , and we rolled down a big movie screen and showed Animal House , which was just coming out at the time . When midnight came , and there was loud , very powerful music over the system , and screaming out of the ceiling came a ten-foot replica of a joint . And there was Bill in the joint . Earlier in the day he had told the police force that Oh , by the way , I 'm going to give away 10,000 joints to this audience . ' And he did . The entire night was magic . That was just the consummate experience for me . <p> <p> TABLE <p> MY HEART IS BROKEN BECAUSE OF MILES and now Bill . The thing that sticks out is the last phone call that I had with Bill . He sounded very different . He was very serene . He had a different kind of voice , he said , Stay well , my friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we always talked about benefits for people , you know , healing people or helping people , stuff like that , but this time he was much more at ease , you know . It was n't like he used to be , at such a frenetic pace . I feel like he had reached a point of realization about certain conditions and circumstances . Just tell people that Bill Graham was a true lion of Judah . He walked like a lion , and he lived like a lion . <p> Photo : Graham and close friend Carlos Santana ( EBET ROBERTS ) <p> Photo : Graham and Bob Dylan at a 1975 benefit ( KEN REGAN/ CAMERA 5 ) <p> Photo : Graham and Keith Richards in 1972 ( KEN REGAN/CAMERA 5 ) <p>
