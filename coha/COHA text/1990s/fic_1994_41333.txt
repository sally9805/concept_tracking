The Falcon . <p> The sun was bright - intense and endless . <p> " Mother , " Charlotte called across the dune , " come join us . " But Marion , sitting still upon the sand , looking out across the desert , pretended not to hear . <p> Marion had been the wife of Roger Kellerman for thirty-two years , but she had not known him at all . Five months earlier , before his sudden death from a heart attack , she would have said otherwise , but death holds surprises for the living too . Now it was too late ; now Marion was a fifty-four-year-old widow weighted with a secret that no longer mattered and she had to get over it - let it go . " To that end she had sought distance , and traveled halfway around the world , to the Middle East , to visit her daughter in Dubai . <p> It had come as something of a shock to Marion to discover , soon after her arrival in Dubai , that she did n't really know her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting , and even at the airport Marion could see the difference . Charlotte , once a tomboy who wanted to be called Charlie , looked now like one of those cool , impeccably turned-out ladies who live in fashionable cities and " do lunch . " Her hair was blonder than dark-haired parents could bestow , she was too thin and too tan ( had they never heard of skin cancer in Dubai ? ) , and she had acquired a mysterious British-flavored accent that made her sound , to Marion , like a complete and not very appealing stranger . <p> Driving through the city from the airport on that first day , Marion had been struck by how modern Dubai looked , a white and clean and shining conglomeration of skyscrapers and luxury hotels . Only an occasional minaret poked up between the high-rises , a faint reminder , like Charlotte 's accent when it faltered , of what lay underneath . <p> It was disconcerting , that odd voice talking to her as if they were still family , distant cousins maybe , once removed . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a slick and snobby Parisian named Jean-Paul whose major interest in life , as far as Marion could tell , was his collection of fine wine . The couple had met when Charlotte spent her junior year of college abroad ; a big mistake in retrospect , though at the time Marion and Roger had patted themselves on the back about it , proud that they could afford to expand their daughter 's horizons . They could never have guessed she would latch on to a foreigner who would expand them still further , plopping her down in various corners of the globe while he engaged in some vague endeavor entitled import-export . But Charlotte seemed happy ; this was all , probably , that a mother should ask . <p> " Mother , " Charlotte called across the dune , waving , " come join us . " <p> Some minutes earlier , when Jean-Paul and the rest of the men had jumped in the back of Stuart 's pick-up and taken off with him after his falcon , Marion had wandered away from her daughter and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand , drinking wine and gossiping , continuing the party begun before Stuart , the gregarious Englishman who was their host for the day , had decided to make his obsession with falconry the after-brunch entertainment and dragged them all out into the desert for the show . <p> Marion had n't been in the mood for a party - was never , at the best of times , adept at the small talk , pretense , and false joviality such occasions demanded - and her mood had n't been improved by the spectacle they 'd come out to the desert to see . In the Middle East falconry had a long and honorable history but to Marion the sport seemed merely cruel : cruel for the pigeons , who were let out of their cages just long enough to be caught and killed by the falcons , and cruel for the falcons , whose few minutes of freedom came only when they were released to make the kill . Marion had been secretly glad when the falcon , wings dark against the sky , proud features gleaming , had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Mother , come here - come join us , " Charlotte said again , more tentatively now , but Marion , her wide Slavic face burning in the midday sun , looked in the other direction , out over the sand dunes , and shook her head " No . " <p> Two weeks after Roger 's funeral , a well-attended event , testament to a good and respected man , Marion had begun the difficult but unavoidable task of going through her husband 's desk : organizing the bills , insurance , and tax papers that he , to his wife 's intense gratitude , had always taken care of . <p> They had been a happy couple , best friends , still tender lovers , and getting over Roger 's death was not easy . Marion had passed quickly from shock to a state of grief distinguished by frequent crying , and going through the tangible remains of her husband 's life was a grim and tearful job . The sight of his signature on a canceled check brought tears , and the Visa bill with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner , and the notations on his desk calendar : a lunch date with Tim Butterworth , a close pal since Roger 's college days , his six-month dental check-up , " Golf at 9 " scrawled confidently on every Saturday page until September . People lived their lives as though they would live forever ; only afterwards you saw the folly of it . The scribbles on Roger 's desk calendar broke her heart . <p> Marion had not anticipated coming upon anything unexpected among her husband 's papers . Although she and Roger had always honored each other 's privacy , they were also , she was certain , a couple without secrets , and when she first came upon the batch of letters from Tim she had set them aside with little thought . She never read her husband 's mail . Besides , most of the envelopes were old and brown around the edges , relics , surely unimportant , of a much earlier time . <p> " Mother , are you okay ? " Charlotte knelt in front of her , her forehead wrinkling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a glass for Marion . " Here ... if you do n't want to sit with the rest of us , at least have a drink . " <p> Marion took the glass charlotte offered . She could tell her daughter was a little drunk ; her accent was pure western Pennsylvania . <p> " Do you think they 'll find the falcon ? " <p> " I 'm pretty sure they will , " Charlotte said . " That 's part of the sport , never knowing when the birds might fly off , but they usually do n't go farther than the ten kilometer radius of their transmitters . " The game , to a large degree , was fixed ; the falcons wore radio transmitters so they could be tracked and found . <p> Charlotte sat down next to Marion on the powder-fine sand . " Do n't worry , " she said , misreading her mother 's question , " I 'm sure it wo n't be much longer ' til the guys get back and we can go home . " <p> That sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not comfortable . Marion had been in Dubai for barely a week but already she and her daughter had run out of topics for casual conversation . The one thing they had n't talked about - Roger - sat between them like his ghost ; only larger , more solid . <p> The night before , Charlotte and Jean-Paul had taken Marion to dinner at Pancho Villa 's , a Tex-Mex restaurant and bar popular with the expatriates . Mexican food had been Roger 's favorite ( he would always say , " the hotter the better " ) and one of the few rituals they 'd had as a family then Charlotte was growing up was to go out for Mexican food once a week . Yet even at Pancho Villa 's , over plates of tongue-searing enchiladas and frijoles , no one had mentioned his name . Marion was reminded of the way the folks back home had acted ever since the funeral - not a word about Roger , as if to mention the dead might hurt the bereaved more than the utter absence of any mention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never existed . <p> A lazy breeze , too warm to refresh , settled a thin veneer of sand on Marion 's skin ; she could feel the sweat forging rivers through it under her blouse . Far away , she imagined she heard a bird cry . <p> " Mother , " Charlotte said finally , as though for once she had actually read her mother 's mind , " you still miss daddy very much , do n't you ? " <p> It was not a question that required an answer but Marion was grateful to have it posed . She opened her mouth to speak , but Charlotte , not noticing , continued . <p> " I never told you this ... " she said . She gazed down at her perfectly manicured toes . " ... Perhaps I should n't tell you now , but you always said you prized honesty above all else ... " Charlotte hesitated . Her cheeks were flushed by the wine and sun and the heat had worn her make-up off , revealing a face much like a younger , softer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it dear ? " Marion asked , trying to sound sympathetic and interested although this mother-daughter stuff was hard for her , had always made her feel inadequate . <p> " You and Daddy were always so close ... so happy together , the perfect couple ... , " she said . " I always felt , well , in the way somehow . Left out . " <p> Marion 's first response was relief ; on surprises here , no new revelation to absorb . She knew she should say something , embrace her daughter and reassure her , tell her she was wrong . But the truth was that Charlotte was right . It was n't only her daughter 's years abroad and marriage to foreigner that had put distance between them . The distance had always been there . Marion and Roger had known as much almost from the moment of Charlotte 's birth ; it was the reason they 'd never had any more children . They had tried best to be good parents , had indulged their daughter , spoiled her . But they had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other that everyone else not locked out . Or so Marion always thought . <p> Most of all , it was the lying she could n't get over . <p> But , at first , before she opened Tim 's letters is an innocent desire to read anything connected with her dead husband , it was the sheer physical absence of Roger that hurt the most . She 'd once heard a man on a talk show say he had missed his wife so much following her death that he 'd shaved his legs , made them smooth so he would have soft skin to held onto in the night . In the weeks after Roger died Marion understood . Each night she sprinkled her husband 's English Leather on his pillow and hung onto it like a life raft . She slept for weeks in one of his shirts , rescued from the dirty-clothes hamper . When she had no choice but to wash the shirt and the sheets that he - they - had slept on , she hurt as if he 'd died all over again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the day she read the letters - before the anger took over . <p> Marion could see billows of dust in the distance , then a small brown speck that rippled from the heat like a watery mirage , enlarging as it came closer . Stuart 's truck . Soon the truck was close enough for her to see Jean-Paul and the other men waving triumphantly from the back . She knew the falcon was with them , hooded a tied , ready to be taken home again to await its next moments of freedom . The bird made Marion enormously sad , and now she realized why . The falcon reminded her of Roger . She wondered of Roger had lived his life like that , feeling trapped but for the times he could fly off and follow , if only for an hour or two , his true nature . <p> Marion had spent so many months angry at the lies , the decades of deception , the lengths her husband had gone to hide his other life . Selfishly , she had focused on herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how hard it must have been for him - what it must have been like to live his life divided , to protect her from the truth , not to share his deepest secret . Now she would never know ; all she knew was that he had always come back , the final proof , perhaps , of his love . For thirty-two years she had lived with a man she did n't know . They had lived a lie together . But she had been happy . <p> The women were standing up , shaking sand out of their clothes , gathering up purses and wine bottles and heading for the cars . Charlotte stood up too , but Marion reached out for her hand , a sudden urgency like Roger 's spirit fluttering in her heart , and stopped her . <p> " You were wrong , Charlie , " she said , squinting into the sun . <p> Marion wrapped her hand around her daughter 's with a mother 's certain grip . " You were wrong .
