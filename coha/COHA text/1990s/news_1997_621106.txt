<p> Anglers are going bonkers over the huge albacore and mahi mahi they 're catching off San Francisco as a result of the growing El Nino , but there 's a biological dark side to this warm-water bonanza . <p> While tropical marine fish are swarming north , native cold-water species probably will take a big hit . Scientists say they expect dramatic declines in the populations of several varieties of oceanic fish and invertebrates . Marine mammals and birds could likewise suffer . <p> El Nino also could dramatically change the character of the California coastline . In 1983 , large storms associated with El Nino destroyed huge tracts of kelp forest off Santa Barbara . It was years before the seaweed grew back , and coastal waters were biologically impoverished in the interim  --  kelp forests are among the richest ecosystems on the planet . <p> " A lot of this is up in the air , but it does n't look good for many species , particularly rockfish , " said Tom Okey , a biologist with the San Francisco office of the Center for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species like yellow rockfish may be able to move north , " said Okey , " but most other ( rockfish ) species live at or near the bottom , and they display what we call ' home- site fidelity . ' They like to stay in one place . They probably wo n't do as well . " <p> Rockfish populations are already at all-time lows , worsening the situation , said Okey . <p> " They 've suffered terribly from overfishing , so ( El Nino ) is the last thing they need , " he said . <p> Okey said El Nino chokes off " upwelling , " the transport of offshore water to inshore areas  --  those within 30 miles of the coast . <p> Upwelling forms the basis of a rich marine food web by saturating shallow coastal waters with nutrient-rich cold water from the abyssal depths , nourishing tiny phytoplankton and zooplankton . These minute organisms are eaten by krill and small fish such as anchovies and sardines , which in turn are consumed by larger fish , birds and marine mammals . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortage , " said Okey . " Not only are there fewer nutrients , but warm water does n't hold ( nutrients ) as effectively as cold water . The whole ecosystem suffers . " <p> Okey said pelagic fish  --  open- ocean species that range far offshore  --  will probably fare better than their inshore cousins . <p> " Salmon do n't like warm water , but they can roam widely and find food and colder water , " said Okey . " Some data suggest that salmon simply stay out in the ocean an extra year or two during El Nino events ( instead of returning to rivers to spawn ) . " <p> Richard Parrish , a biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service , agreed that salmon manage to muddle through El Nino periods  --  but added that they may not get off completely unscathed . <p> Parrish said the current El Nino caps 15 years of steadily climbing ocean temperatures off the Western continental United States . <p> " It 's kind of a double whammy , " he said . " You have an El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 degrees warmer than it was ( 15 years ago ) . We do n't know if the long-term trend is the result of global warming or a natural oceanic cycle . We know there are some marine temperature cycles that may last 60 years . " <p> Marine mammals also could face some hardships in coming months . El Nino 's effect on kelp beds could devastate sea otters , which hunt and rest in these extensive marine forests . <p> " There could be a number of possible impacts , " said Ellen Faurot-Daniels , the science director for Friends of the Sea Otter , a Monterey conservation group . <p> " El Nino-generated storms can kill the otters directly , " said Faurot-Daniels . " They can also rip up the kelp beds , or the kelp can deteriorate from the warm water . When the kelp goes , so do favorite otter prey species such as turban snails and kelp crabs . " <p> Faurot-Daniels said research indicates that rockfish either move offshore where the water is colder or hang around close to shore and suffer weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otters prefer invertebrates to fish , but that got me thinking , " she said . " If bottom- dwelling organisms such as rock crabs and scallops also lose weight , then the otters would have to hunt harder  --  which is significant , considering they have to eat the equivalent of one-fourth to one-third of their weight per day to survive . " <p> Scarce food could put the otters at greater risk for stress , making them vulnerable to the myriad parasites and disease-causing bacteria that thrive in warm water . <p> Faurot-Daniels said the necessity of increased hunting also may result in prolonged separations between otter mothers and their pups  --  a scenario often fatal for the pups , which are ill-equipped to handle the rigors of the sea alone . <p> Pinnipeds such as seals and sea lions are also likely to suffer from the waxing El Nino . <p> " In previous El Ninos , we had a major increase in elephant seal , harbor seal and sea lion strandings ( sick or dead animals washing up on beaches ) , mostly involving juveniles , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marine Fisheries Service . " Normally , we see about 1,500 strandings a year . In 1992 , when we also had El Nino conditions , we recorded 2,600 strandings . In 1983 , another El Nino year , we had 2,200 strandings . This year , we think we could have 3,000 or more . " <p> Cordaro added that California 's pinniped populations are doing well and can tolerate such attrition . <p> Northern California 's marine birds may be another matter . Several species of offshore birds are almost wholly dependent on cold- water fish and crustaceans , and scientists say they are at great risk from the encroaching warm water . <p> " There 's the potential for catastrophic effects , particularly where the alcids are concerned , " said David Ainley , a biologist with H.T. Harvey and Associates , an Alviso environmental consulting firm . <p> Alcids are members of the auk family  --  streamlined , penguin- like birds that usually thrive off Northern California . Species include murres , tufted puffins and Cassin 's auklets . <p> " I was on a transect cruise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two murres and five Cassin 's auklets , " said Ainley . " That 's really unprecedented . " <p> Ainley explained that alcids have evolved for diving and are not adept at flying long distances for food . They are accustomed to their prey  --  krill and small fish  --  coming to them from upwelling . <p> " What we 're seeing now does n't bode particularly well for the future , " said Ainley . " Right now , there 's still a little upwelling going on  --  but as the phytoplankton declines , so will the birds . This is just the beginning . " <p> EL NINO 'S EFFECT ON COASTAL SEA LIFE <p> . <p> While anglers celebrate the appearance of tuna , marlin and mahi mahi off the North Coast due to El Nino , the surge of warm water associated with the phenomenon is expected to slash populations of cold water marine species . Among them are : <p> . <p> PLANKTON : These tiny plants ( phytoplankton ) and animals ( zooplankton ) normally " bloom " in vast quantities because of seasonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food web . <p> . <p> KRILL : These small shrimp-like crustaceans are a staple food for a tremendous array of marine creatures , including rockfish , salmon , baleen whales and several species of birds . <p> . <p> ROCKFISH : Once the basis of a robust fishing industry , rockfish have declined drastically in recent years due to overfishing . El Ni226o only adds to their woes : They are deprived of food and they dislike warm water . <p> . <p> MURRE : These elegant marine birds nest by the tens of thousands on offshore islands 320 when cold water krill and baitfish are in good supply , that is . Scientists expect murres to decline significantly during the developing El Nino . <p> . <p> SEA OTTER : Only slightly more than 2,000 of these mammals live off California . They are extremely vulnerable to storms generated by El Nino , and are in danger of starvation as cold water-loving kelp forests decline , depriving them of favorite foods . <p> . <p> HOW UPWELLING FEEDS THE COAST <p> In normal years , nutrient-rich cold water " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers of inshore water with nutrients . This enriched water produces vast quantitites of plankton , the staff of life for marine species of all kinds . <p> . <p> El Nino stops upwelling , the transport of nutrient-rich cold water from offshore depths to shallow nearshore areas .
