<p> Plastic mulches have been part of the agricultural scene for some 40 years . They retain moisture in drip-irrigated rows , retard the emergence of weeds , and warm the roots of young crop plants . Early on , farmers or gardeners shopping for these sheets of impermeable plastic would find their range of hues limited to what Henry Ford offered 1914 Model T buyers : " Any color , so long as it 's black . " <p> Eventually , brown and greenish plastic joined the ranks . Only recently has real color begun to explode on the mulch scene . Half mile-long sheets of red plastic have been available for a few years , and silver is expected to be marketed more widely this spring . Before long , yellow , blue , and a rainbow of other hues may also beckon from the pages of agricultural and gardening supply catalogs . <p> The shade of mulch a grower chooses is less likely to reflect personal style , however , than the wavelength of the light spectrum needed by the cultivar it will nurture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mulch stems from Michael J. Kasperbauer 's more than 30-year scrutiny of light sensors in plants . <p> Kasperbauer , who is a plant physiologist with the Department of Agriculture 's Coastal Plains Soil , Water , and Plant Research Laboratory in Florence , S.C. , has spent his career probing how plants respond to light . Those investigations have demonstrated that wavelength  --  or color  --  plays as critical a role as intensity . In fact , the more experiments his team performs , the more traits they discover that can be altered by a mulch 's color . <p> These studies are just beginning to suggest how the activation of color sensors in leaves orchestrates key operations in plants as diverse as tobacco , cotton , tomatoes , and carrots . Yet the preliminary data that he and others have already gleaned suggest that by outfitting a plant 's soil in the appropriate hue , growers can improve not only the quantity and quality of their yields but also a plant 's flavor and resistance to pests . <p> Kasperbauer began studying phytochrome in 1961 , just two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein gauges the intensity of certain wavelengths of light , particularly those in the red ( 640 to 670 nanometers ) and far-red ( roughly 700 to 750 nm ) range . Unlike the red wavelengths , those in the far red are not photosynthetically active ; that is , they do not fuel plant growth and vigor . Rather , Kasperbauer has found , they serve as environmental cues . <p> " Green leaves reflect a lot of far-red light , " he says . While these wavelengths fall just beyond what the human eye can see , phytochrome reacts to them like a beacon . Kasperbauer 's studies have established that when plants sense a high ratio of far-red to red light , they realize that " lots of neighbors are nearby , " threatening to siphon off a disproportionate share of the sun 's growth-sustaining energy . Plants respond by redirecting more of their energy into above-ground growth , usually at the expense of roots . The resulting taller , thinner plants compete more successfully for sunlight . <p> In the mid-1980s , Kasperbauer teamed with Patrick G. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether other natural features might provide related spectral signals that influence growth . They started by looking down  --  to the stubble left on the ground and to the actual color of the soil . Again , materials that reflect a higher-than-usual proportion of far-red light onto the seedlings  --  such as brick-red soil or straw residues  --  spurred the plants ' above-ground growth more than black soil , black mulch , or white plastic did . The potential economic significance of these observations did n't emerge until Clemson ( S.C. ) University horticulturalist Dennis R. Decoteau joined the team , turning its focus to tomatoes . <p> Fooling Plants to Grow Better . Decoteau recalls wondering whether it would be possible to fool a plant into thinking it was in crowded conditions by carpeting the soil with red mulch , thereby inducing a growth spurt in seedlings . In the field , plants surrounded by red plastic indeed grew faster than normal . <p> They also went on to produce earlier , larger fruit . In studies over the past decade , this far-red reflecting material has enhanced yields by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Reasoning that the opposite tactic should benefit root crops , the scientists grew turnips in soil covered with an orange mulch . In fact , Kasperbauer notes , the plastic 's orange appearance was only incidental . What mattered was that this mulch reflected up onto the plants ' foliage a greater amount of red light and only a little far-red light . <p> Come harvest , turnips grown under the orange mulch indeed proved bigger than those mulched with black or red plastic . <p> Affecting Resistance to Pathogens , Chemicals . The influence of a mulch 's color does n't end with yield . Three years ago , Kasperbauer and plant physiologist Robert E. Wilkinson of the Georgia Agricultural Experiment Station in Griffin turned their attention to plant waxes . A combination of fats , alcohols , and hydrocarbons , waxes are what make the surface of a leaf shiny . They not only keep a plant from losing water , they can serve as a barrier to pathogens and chemicals . <p> A self-professed " weed man , " Wilkinson was especially interested in chemical deterrents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeds succumb to a low dose of herbicides , while others of the same species thrive after being doused with the toxic chemicals . He suspected that the variability could be traced to differences in the film of wax that coats a leaf 's surface  --  an idea that was heretical , he claims , because the prevailing wisdom held that a plant 's wax content was fixed , immune to environmental modification . <p> As a test , he asked Kasperbauer for samples of plants grown under different wavelengths of light . The bell pepper leaves that he received came from plants grown within 100 yards of each other . Because those plants received identical sunlight from above , the primary difference between them was the amount and timing of far-red light reflected from the white , black , or red plastic mulch below . <p> " To our joyous amazement , " Wilkinson told Science News , " that small difference in reflected light dramatically altered the quality of the waxes present on the leaf . " He says it now appears that the ratio of far-red to red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be active and thus the composition and quantity of the resulting wax . <p> From the perspective of preserving its moisture , a plant might do better if it is mulched with white , which will give its leaves more wax , he says . Some fungi and other pests feed on those waxes , however , so from a crop protection standpoint , a farmer might prefer a black mulch , which would reduce the wax in favor of more pest-resistant alkanes ( a type of pure hydrocarbon ) . Red mulch led to a wax equivalent to that obtained with a black plastic mulch but an alkane profile more like the one with white mulch . <p> And Taste , Too . As the South Carolina scientists grew tomatoes , strawberries , peppers , turnips , and other plants under different color regimes , they tasted subtle differences in the produce . " We figured that if we can taste the difference , " Kasperbauer recalls , " chemists ought to be able to tell us why . " <p> George F. Antonious of Kentucky State University in Frankfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They offered 25 adults samples of turnips . Unbeknownst to the volunteers , the vegetables came from batches grown on three different colors of mulch . <p> Twenty-four of the volunteers described turnips from blue-mulched plastic as " sharp , " whereas those mulched in green tasted mild , " almost sweet . " Turnips grown under white mulch possessed the least distinct flavor . <p> Consistent with the taste panel 's observations , the roots grown under green mulch had the most soluble sugars , Antonious ' group reported in the September 1996 Photochemistry and Photobiology . Turnips mulched with blue contained the highest concentrations of glucosinolates , a family of chemicals responsible for imparting the bite to horseradish and mustard greens . Also found in broccoli , these compounds may reduce the risk of certain cancers . <p> Since the blue and green mulches reflected roughly equivalent amounts of red , far-red , and photosynthetically active light , the scientists note , the chemical differences between turnips must trace to something else  --  perhaps the blue light ( 440 to 460 nm ) , which reflected most strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyses of carrots and strawberries grown with different colored mulches are now under way . <p> Fighting Blight . Perhaps the least expected attribute of color has been its role in countering the ravages of nematodes , parasitic roundworms that burrow into the roots of plants , such as tomatoes . A root tumor that develops around each worm serves as a nest for the next generation of nematodes . While these worms usually do not kill their host , the energy they steal to fuel their growth and reproduction can severely diminish a plant 's yield , as well as its resistance to other blights . <p> Earlier this year , Clemson University nematologist Bruce A. Fortnum sterilized the soil in a few small South Carolina plots to kill any resident root-knot nematodes . Working with Hunt and Kasperbauer , he then planted tomatoes in red- or black-mulched rows in the sterilized plots and inoculated half of the plants in each mulch with up to 100,000 nematode eggs . <p> Despite high rates of infection , plants in the red-mulched rows yielded 85% as much fruit as nematode-free plants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plants in black-mulched plots . <p> What appears to have happened , Fortnum says , is that the red mulch enabled the plant " to mature a little quicker , so that it produced much of its fruit before the nematodes laid their eggs . " It 's during the egg-laying period that nematodes drain the most energy from the plant . Moreover , by telling the plant to concentrate most of its growth in the above ground tissue , the red mulch may have caused malnutrition in the rootbound nematodes , he says , slowing their growth and reproduction . <p> Michael Orzolek , a vegetable crops scientist at Pennsylvania State University in College Park , has also observed pest inhibiting advantages of mulches . Aphids appear to ignore plants mulched with silver , he says , and " we find the lowest populations of insects in plants mulched with blue . " <p> Yellow , in contrast , attracts a host of bugs . Therefore , by judiciously mulching with yellow every seventh row or so  --  and using black , red , or some other mulch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to survey for pests , " he 's found . " If there are any pests , they 'll be in that sentinel yellow row . " The grower can then treat just the yellow row , as needed , or occasionally the whole field " if the pests are flying insects or move by leaping , as the leaf hopper does . " <p> Words of Caution . Before rushing out to place an order for vermilion mulch , consider a few words of caution . <p> Orzolek 's preliminary work indicates that some of the effects may be cultivar specific . For instance , in many of his trials , cucumbers have delivered more fruit and fewer misshapen fruits  --  a plus in the marketplace  --  when mulched with blue rather than black , red , or yellow . One year , on a whim , he tried the mulches on a hybrid cucumber and found that it appeared even more responsive to yield improvements with the blue mulch than the cultivar he tested earlier . <p> Brent Loy of the University of New Hampshire in Durham found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with red mulch . The reason , he now suspects , is that he did n't stake his tomatoes , so they may have covered the mulch by midseason , erasing any reflective advantage it might have had . Alternatively , he notes , he may have oriented his rows so that by midseason each plant was shading its neighbor and much of the mulch . <p> Kasperbauer also points out that two red plastics that appear identical to the human eye may reflect quite different far red light  --  rendering one beneficial and the other useless . The same may be true of blues or any other hue . Yet few other research labs have correlated a mulch 's reflectance with yield or pest data , he says , making it hard to determine what underlies their reported benefits . <p> " That 's why the patent that the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Clemson University have pending describes the specific reflection spectrum that a mulch must have , " Kasperbauer says . While red mulches have been marketed by several companies for at least 10 years , the reflectance-specified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now becoming widely available . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> By Janet Raloff <p> <p> Ms. Raloff is senior editor for environment/policy at Science News .
