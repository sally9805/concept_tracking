PAT BUCHANAN KNOWS HE CA N'T BEAT BOB DOLE , SO he 's picking a new fight  --  with Colin Powell . Sipping from a Styrofoam cup of Chardonnay during a late-night fl ight to Knoxville , Tennessee , last week , Buchanan told TIME , " If Dole wins the nomination and chooses Colin Powell as his running mate , the right-to-life movement will walk out of the convention , a good part of the Christian Coalition will walk , and the principled conservatives will battle " the Powell choice . Chief among them , he promises , will be Pat Buchanan . <P> In which case , Buchanan , who has already infuriated Republican leaders by his refusal to tone down his attacks on Dole , will also be pitting himself against the potential running mate who could do the most for the Republican ticket . Party elders know that Powell would bring Dole 's campaign some much needed star quality , along with a hefty share of the black and moderate vote . When it comes to the vice presidency , says a senior Dole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> A lot of voters seem to feel the same way . The latest TIME/CNN poll suggests that if the election were held now , Clinton would beat Dole , 49% to 40% . Add the retired general to the ticket , however , and it 's Dole-Powell over Clinton-Gore , 47% to 45% . Meanwhile , the political cost to Dole of a pro-choice running mate would appear to be manageable . Despite Buchanan 's threats to rock the convention if Dole taps Powell , or any other pro-choice possibility , less than a quarter of Republicans surveyed would make abortion a litmus-test issue for their vice-presidential nominee . Only 12% would be less inclined to vote Republican if Powell , for instance , were No. 2 . But 62% of independents and 38% of Democrats said they would be more likely to vote Republican if Powell were on the ticket . <P> For his part , Powell has spoken out against Buchananism while others in the party remained silent . Such aggressiveness has given some of Dole 's team hope that the general might be angry enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the general think otherwise . Michael Powell , his son , told TIME that it is " farfetched to think Pat Buchanan 's presence will make him want to put on the armor and come rolling in . " If so , this would be one fight that Buchanan wins by a forfeiture . <P>  --  By Jeffrey H. Birnbaum . With reporting by J.F.O. McAllister/Washington and Eric Pooley/New York
