/Jan 1998 Much to the dismay of parents who believe they 're finally finished with potty training , bathroom accidents may recur for a year or even longer . " Kids can get so absorbed in activities that they do n't pay attention to their body 's signals , " says Becky Chamberlain , M.D. , a staff pediatrician at Massachusetts General Hospital , in Boston . While your child learns to recognize her bladder 's call and to respond properly , she 'll benefit from your patience and understanding . Meanwhile : Make sure she uses the toilet before she starts any activity from which she wo n't want to be distracted , such as playing with her friends . Plan for bathroom breaks before and during lengthy car rides , shopping trips , and other excursions . Even if she says she does n't have to go , prod her to try-something almost always comes out . Point out the potties when your child visits the homes of friends and relatives , or starts a new school or day-care program . Accidents often happen because children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At malls , supermarkets , and restaurants , find out where the facilities are before doing anything else : Accidents also happen when parents have to search for a rest room . WASTE MANAGEMENT Despite your best efforts , accidents will happen . Be prepared by carrying a change of clothes-including shoes and socks . Should your child need the clean outfit , act swiftly , quietly , and calmly . " Say something like , " I see you had an accident . That 's okay . We 'll get you all cleaned up , " ' suggests Nathan Azrin , Ph.D. , author of Toilet Training in Less Than a Day . SPECIAL SITUATIONS Sometimes bathroom accidents indicate underlying stress-from , say , moving or starting new day care . If you suspect this might be the problem , provide extra reassurance and support . More than one accident a week requires a consultation with your pediatrician . The problem could be due to a subtle stressor that she can help pinpoint or , in rare circumstances , a physiological problem , such as a urinary-tract infection . Bowel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurs more frequently , and bowel movements tend to come on slower , giving children more time to get to the bathroom . Treat them the same way ; if they happen more than once a week , consult with your pediatrician. - MARGIE MARKARIAN Photograph If she wets , dry her body-and her tears // <p>
