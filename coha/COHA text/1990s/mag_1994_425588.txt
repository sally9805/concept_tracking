Section : School Wars American Education Under Siege <p> We might gauge the intellectual heft of today 's college students by watching their faces as they gather their texts in the campus bookstore at the beginning of the semester . Expressions of curiosity and expectation as they glance over the titles tend to be outnumbered by those of resigned indifference and , sometimes , shock ; the students unite only in disgust at the prices . But the same exercise can also give us an idea of the intellectual heft of the institutions to which these students have handed themselves over for an education . <p> One of my students recently described her trip to the bookstore to buy the texts for a course I have taught , a survey of major classical works in translation . She looked over the authors , daunted . Aeschylus , Sophocles , Plato , Virgil . Standing in the checkout line , she showed them to her roommate , whose response was unexpected . <p> You 're lucky you get to read the old stuff , ' she said . Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slick editions of Alice Walker , Maya Angelou , Toni Morrison , and even Silence of the Lambs . I do n't know why I have to read this , ' she said , thumping the Thomas Harris novel . I 've seen the movie three times . And these other people are on Oprah anyway . ' For me this was vindication of a kind . <p> A gentleman I know taught history for more than thirty years at a small liberal arts college in Virginia . On the eve of my first day as a teaching assistant several years ago , his advice to me was , Never let the smart ones get bored , ' an axiom of instruction much out of favor nowadays . Whenever one of this man 's pupils would bristle at some stern correction , whether it be of a misstatement of fact or an error in grammar , he was wont to ask , You did come to college for an education , did n't you ? ' <p> It 's a question I dare not ask now . I know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have n't come for an education . They have come to get a union card that will certify four or more years of munificently wasted time and money ; some , shrewd and unwilling to validate the orchestrated charade , are bitter enough to call it that . I can not fault their cynicism . In a glutted marketplace , they know that employers require BAs to work in the mail room and MAs to answer the telephone . A college degree is worth both more and less than it was thirty years ago . The degree-for-higher-pay swap is sure . But mass-market pressures to pass almost everyone through the system with as little fuss as possible have seriously compromised the intellectual value of a college degree . <p> Most state universities now are no more than pricey vocational schools where instruction aims at training for specific tasks , not at an education that would rigorously inform and quicken the rational faculty . Nor have we in the humanities helped matters ; we can not even agree on what makes great literature great , and some of us have dismissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rest of us , who consider such sinister constructs ' to be the very sinews of culture , are left to plod on as best we can . <p> The survey course , even at its best , is aptly named . It is a panorama , a sweeping view of a vast horizon of majestic and often forbidding mountains . The view may be grand , but one can tell only so much from a scenic drive-by . Not much actual learning occurs in these courses . Learning happens down in the valleys , where the soil is tilled by hands familiar with the lay of the land . But in an ever more complex world where further complications confine us to ever tinier mental rooms , there is merit in the long look ; if it does nothing else , it reminds us of our smallness next to the vastness of everything else  --  no mean discovery if one is perplexed in the cosmos . Or so I tell each successive group of confused and yawning faces . <p> If one ca n't hope to teach much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one out to do ? Briefly put , one tries to convey a sense of history , of the continuities of thought and feeling through time ; to show that , however advanced we believe ourselves to be , prior generations  --  not the ancients only  --  have equaled or bettered us in just about every category of spiritual and intellectual activity  --  in almost everything , in fact , that does n't depend on the latest material improvements ( things like rockets , air conditioners , and anaesthetics ) . People long dead , particularly the classical poets and philosophers , not only thought our thoughts , they thought them first , gave them shape , often with acute precision , and bequeathed a common , humane vocabulary . Rarely if ever have we expressed the thunder of war as well as Homer or flown a phrase as well as Horace ; conveyed unutterable passion as well as Sappho or heroic designs as well as Virgil . These people and their achievements , quite simply , made us who we a re , and we ca n't begin to divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without them  --  which only someone who knows their works well can do . Teaching and learning about those who have made the modern world possible , with all its strengths and flaws , become acts of gratitude . <p> For a time I began my survey with Homer , an obvious choice chronologically but a great stumbling block for those unaccustomed to reading anything more taxing than the sports page . The Iliad and Odyssey demand concentration , even in translation , and several students had fled by the third week . Aeschylus was too dense , Plato too pedantic . I needed a work that would lift the students ' minds out of their own time without forcing them to leave behind a sense of their own time 's concerns . Then , two years ago , came an idea : I would begin the course with the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius . <p> The Meditations is not one of the major works . Marcus Aurelius , a Roman emperor during the middle of the second century of the Christian era , is not a major author . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied a niche amongst educated readers until two or three generations ago . Translations abounded . It became for many Victorians a kind of self-help book : a smattering of maxims and reminders that did not encumber the reader and conceivably might help him through a tough patch in his life . It was bedstand reading . <p> The book may now be enjoying a resurgence . One minuscule new edition of a kind you 're likely to find in the inspiration ' section of a bookstore carries a blurb that says it continues to inspire all who struggle to live a meaningful and productive life in a troubled age . ' Another is marketed with the assertion that the Meditations has had , after the Bible , the greatest impact of any book on Bill Clinton  --  a referral that , if you 've read the book , strikes you as odd . <p> The book as we have it is the journal Marcus kept while on military campaigns against the barbarians near the end of his life . Like most journals , it wanders with no clear purpose or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , students have taken to it with alacrity . I think I know why . <p> This book typifies the approach to philosophy that dominated the Western civilized world from Hellenistic times to the end of the Roman Empire , which held that the cardinal aim of philosophic effort was to show us , not where we came from or where we were going , but how to live . The idea was to cultivate virtue , to discover a code to live by  --  in this case , a stoicism which was , writes translator Maxwell Staniforth , manly , rational , and temperate , a code which insisted on just and virtuous dealing , self-discipline , unflinching fortitude , and complete freedom from the storms of passion . ' <p> Whatever else this description may signify , it does not seem to fit the current cultural environment . And it may be that many of the intelligent young are drawn to it for just this reason . One told me what a liberating experience reading the Meditations was after 12 years in the public schools , where he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own impulses . Another , a strung-out but smart fellow with hair down to his belt , asked if he could delay turning in an essay by a day because he had lent his copy to a troubled friend . He needed it more than I did last night , ' he explained . ( I inquired no further . ) One young woman , after the course was finished , practically offered me her first-born for changing the orientation of her life  --  primarily , it seemed , by assigning this book . However much I might have wanted the credit , I knew it was n't mine , and I wondered whether these students were seeing something here that I , who had read the work a couple dozen times , had missed . <p> INSTEAD of writing a standard essay about it , one student wrote his own version of Book I , a catalogue of gratitude where Marcus enumerates the many people to whom he is indebted . Marcus thanks his grandfather , from whom he learned courtesy and serenity of temper , ' and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the list goes : teachers , kinsmen , friends . A man named Rusticus he thanks for encouraging him to be accurate in my reading , and not content with a mere general idea of the meaning ' ' ; another teacher showed him the need to make decisions for myself instead of depending on the hazards of chance ' ' ; a certain philosopher stood as his model of self-control , fixity of purpose , and cheerfulness under ill-health or other misfortunes . ' And so on . The student 's version had a similar tone , but for his admission in closing that this was the first time he had ever considered how many people he had to thank . The realization saddened him . <p> Class discussions usually work well  --  that is , serve an educative purpose  --  only if carefully guided ; rap sessions tend to impede close thinking . But in this case allowing some leeway brought forth pointed observations . One happy casualty of our inquiry was that bugbear of all serious students of history : the issue of relevance . ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old ' books as irrelevant ' or , at best , marginal to modern times . As we progressed in the course , many began to see that such a judgment , even if valid for a particular work , can be made only after wide reading and years of sympathetic experience . <p> So what did we read ? Here is a sampling of passages that have spurred especially strong reactions , in all cases Marcus 's instructions to himself : <p> Begin each day by telling yourself : Today I shall be meeting with interference , ingratitude , insolence , disloyalty , ill-will , and selfishness  --  all of them due to the offenders ' ignorance of what is good or evil . ' This never fails to elicit remarks about drivers ' etiquette . <p> Do not waste what remains of your life in speculating about your neighbors , unless with a view to some mutual benefit . ' <p> Put from you the belief that ' I have been wronged , ' and with it will go the feeling . Reject your sense of injury , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame for past misdeeds , public and private , legitimate and otherwise , in a new light . <p> To refrain from imitation is the best revenge . ' <p> If a man makes a slip , admonish him gently and show him his mistake . If you fail to convince him , blame yourself , or else blame nobody . ' <p> Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be . Be one . ' <p> And lest these admonitions appear too stringent : Do not be distressed . . . if now and again practice falls short of precept . ' <p> Taken in small bits , these exhortations may sound like nuggets of dime-store wisdom . But the cumulative effect is more penetrating . With its confessional tone , the Meditations engaged my students with a personality , with the mind of someone who lived 1,800 years ago , an emperor who nonetheless had constantly to remind himself to live for what is right and good and to be diverted neither by fashion nor by mood . But also deeply embedded here is an implicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Discussions usually needed steering to prevent them from becoming therapy sessions , as even some of the quiet students related their epiphanies . One day a student abruptly remarked , Now all that religion I got makes more sense , ' prompting alarmed stares from the smug and the bored . It was n't a conversion . It was simply a reasoned recognition of what rules of behavior were designed to do . <p> Not all of the book reads so smoothly . Stoics believed suicide an allowable option for a life hopelessly off track . Words like reason ' and nature ' must be specifically defined by second-century Stoic understandings if the class is to avoid getting bogged down in archaic cosmologies . But attention to the varied meanings of words leads to greater care in formulating ideas themselves , a valuable habit . And after reading the Meditations , passions , base and noble alike , stand out in sharper relief , so that when we do turn to Homer , the relentless , destructive anger of Achilles and the high nobility of Hector take on an impelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real world ' that is supposed to have the last word . As one young woman wrote in an essay , the world seemed bigger ' after reading the Meditations . <p> This is about all an instructor talking with a class two or three times a week can expect , but it is a thin vein of silver . The students still have to meet the next and everlasting challenge of taking this broad view and narrowing the focus to apply it both to the modern age and to themselves . For the duration of the term , though , some fresh and agile minds are confronting a few of the finer expressions of the human spirit . Some may wonder if they will be equal to the weight of what little they have learned . That 's one way to measure intellectual progress . Plato they 'll probably leave behind forever . But I 'm told that at the end of term , when books for this course get returned to the bookstore for resale , the Meditations is often missing from the pile . <p> By TRACY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at NR . <p>
