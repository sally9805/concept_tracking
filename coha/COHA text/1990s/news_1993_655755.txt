<p> ALTHOUGH Moscow is losing its ability to govern Russia , it is nevertheless trying to extend its control over neighboring states . Citing Russia 's " vital interests " and " special responsibilities " Boris Yeltsin recently asked the world community to deputize Russia so it can start policing what used to be the Soviet Union . On Feb. 28 , in a speech to the Civic Union ( an ad-hoc coalition of former Communist Party apparatchiks and managers of state enterprises ) , the Russian president indicated that " the time ha s come for distinguished international organizations , including the UN , to grant Russia special powers of a guarantor of peace and stability in regions of the former USSR . " <p> Mr. Yeltsin 's appeal to legitimate a new Russian sphere of influence is unlikely to be repeated by a conservative successor , should he be ousted . The move would probably be taken unilaterally . <p> Months before Yeltsin 's Civic Union address , Russian politicians and statesmen had begun stumping internationally for the sheriff 's job , mainly on the platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians who , due to the break-up of the USSR into 15 independent states , have suddenly become minorities in foreign countries . Judging from the response of Western decisionmakers and opinion shapers they have succeeded in distorting the minority question in the former USSR by defining it as an exclusively Russian problem . This has dangerous implications not only for Russia 's neighbors but also for the global community . Misleading figures <p> First of all , the figure of 25 million Russians living in diaspora is in itself misleading . This number may reflect the most recent Soviet census of 1989 . But the census , in the opinion of many specialists , deliberately overstates the strength of the Russians to mitigate the demographic strength and growing restlessness among the USSR 's non-Russian nationalities . Already by 1989 Russians were returning to Russia from the other republics by the thousands , and this trend accelerated visibly after the disin tegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 . Clearly , if another census were taken today there would be considerably fewer than 25 million people living outside of the Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enormous Russian diaspora . Yet , it is not clear that Russians in other countries would welcome Moscow 's intervention on their behalf . In Ukraine a majority of its 11 million ethnic Russians voted for Ukrainian independence in December 1991 . Also , most of the Russian officers stationed in Ukraine opted to swear allegiance to Ukraine rather than return to an uncertain future in Russia . For many in the Russian diaspora , emotional and economic roots run deeper in non-Russian soil . Actually , in relative terms the Russian problem of diaspora is no larger than the problem of diaspora for any of the other former Soviet republics . The Russians living in diaspora account for about 17 percent of the total ethnic Russian population . This is about the same percentage of minorities living in other states that one finds among all the other 14 titular nationalities of the former Soviet republics . <p> Russia has the largest number of ethnic minorities . More than 27 million non-Russians reside within the Russian Federation . Put another way , almost 40 percent of the former Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only minorities living outside Russia , but those who live within its borders . What about non-Russians ? <p> While Russia is making an international bid to protect minorities outside its borders , many of the minorities living in Russia are asserting their independence . Russia faces the prospect of disintegration . Addressing only the " 25 million Russian minority " issue ignores the 27 million non-Russian minorities who live in Russia . <p> Russia 's neighbors say Moscow is merely using the pretext of protecting Russian minority rights to mask latent imperial and nationalistic ambitions . Claims of Russia 's " vital interests " and " special responsibilities " on the territory of the former USSR are particularly troublesome to the second largest former Soviet republic , Ukraine , which is home to the largest number of Russians living in diaspora . The Ukrainian government sees Yeltsin 's bid to become the internationally sanctioned regional policeman as following a pattern of Russian revanchism established by three of the most powerful political figures in Russia : Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoi , speaker of the parliament Ruslan Khasbulatov , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity . <p> Further alarming Ukraine and other former Soviet republics is that such revanchist rhetoric appears in Russia 's new military doctrine . Specifically , it assigns to Russia 's armed forces the mission not only of defending Russia 's citizens , but an arbitrarily defined group of so-called " Russian speakers " living in the newly independent states bordering Russia . Meanwhile , Russian military units are already engaged in bloody military actions in four former Soviet republics - Moldova , Georgia , Tajikistan , and Azerbaijan . <p> Regardless of Russia 's underlying motivations , giving it an international green light to act as a guarantor of peace and stability will only heighten tensions . This is especially true with Ukraine , which cites its national security concerns vis-a-vis Russia as the primary reason for delaying ratification of the START I treaty . Not only will nuclear disarmament be jeopardized by an escalation of Russo-Ukrainian tensions , so will 25 percent of Europe 's natural gas , which runs through Ukraine 's pipelines . The West is n't powerless <p> Many think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of events in the former Soviet Union . By assuming helplessness , the West imagines it is absolved from the burden of thinking through the implications that resurgent militant Russian **27;695;TOOLONG will have on the democratic and economic development of the former Soviet Union . Propping up the West 's powerlessness is the curious but popular notion of Russian nationalism as a dangerous rattlesnake . The argument is th at if America does not sidestep the rattlesnake ( but rather presses Serbs for a peace settlement in Bosnia , for example , or opposes Russia 's attempt to reestablish its imperial grip over former republics ) , then it will be bitten - not in the US 's best interests . Some snake-shy sages suggest that there is little the West can do to counter the resurgence of Russian nationalism - except helplessly watch as the reptile grows and slithers along its tragic path . <p> Actually , the West can play an important role in defusing ethnic tensions in the former USSR . President Clinton may have taken a tentative first step in doing this when he mentioned during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the human rights of Russian minorities - and of all minorities - living in and around the region . <p> The American president should follow-up on this statement by sending a clear signal that aid to former Soviet republics will be preconditioned on meeting human rights standards set by international law . Rights of all minorities living on the territory of the former USSR need to be honored , not only those of the Russian minorities . While recognizing Russia 's and the former republics ' special interests in their diaspora , the US , along with the international community , should refuse Russia 's or any other co untry 's bid to unilaterally " police " its neighbors . Additionally , America mediation may prevent diplomatic tensions over minority rights in the former Soviet Union from developing into conflicts . An honest broker is needed in helping ease tensions between Ukraine and Russia . That also could salvage the START treaty .
