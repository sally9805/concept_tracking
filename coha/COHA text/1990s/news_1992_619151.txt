<p> " Bugsy , " the glossy gangster epic that introduced Warren Beatty to his real-life girlfriend Annette Bening , led the Oscar pack with 10 nominations yesterday when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced contenders for the 64th annual awards . <p> In addition to a best picture nod , nominations went to Beatty ( best actor ) , director Barry Levinson , screenwriter James Toback and supporting actors Harvey Keitel and Ben Kingsley . Bening , the mother of Beatty 's newborn daughter , was snubbed in the best actress race . <p> " Beauty and the Beast , " the Disney version of the classic French fairy tale , also was nominated as best picture  --  an Oscar first for an animated film . " Beauty " and " Bugsy " will compete in the top category , along with Oliver Stone 's overheated debate on the Kennedy assassination , " JFK , " Barbra Streisand 's touchy-feelie family drama , " The Prince of Tides , " and Jonathan Demme 's tense murder thriller , " The Silence of the Lambs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to " Bugsy , " which may get a new boost to its disappointing $ 39.7 million box-office gross , the top vote-getters were " JFK , " eight nominations ; " The Prince of Tides " and " The Silence of the Lambs , " seven apiece ; " Beauty and the Beast " and " Terminator 2 : Judgment Day , " six apiece ; and Steven Spielberg 's overblown fantasy " Hook , " five . <p> Another Oscar first was the simultaneous mother-daughter recognition for Diane Ladd and Laura Dern , the stars of Martha Coolidge 's delicate period drama , " Rambling Rose . " Three-time nominee Ladd was nominated as best supporting actress , and her daughter , 25 , as best actress . <p> Probably the biggest surprise was the well-deserved double nomination of John Singleton , the 24-year-old black film maker who wrote and directed " Boyz N the Hood , " a low-budget drama about young blacks growing up in crime-riddled South Central Los Angeles . <p> FIRST BLACK NOMINEE <p> Singleton , nominated for best direction and for best original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior project at the University of Southern California . He becomes the first black and the youngest film maker ever nominated as best director . Previous record-holder Orson Welles was 26 when nominated for " Citizen Kane " ( 1941 ) . <p> In addition to Singleton and Levinson , best director nominees were Demme for " The Silence of the Lambs , " Ridley Scott for the female buddy adventure " Thelma &; Louise " and Oliver Stone for " JFK . " <p> Traditional Oscar castoff Barbra Streisand heads the list of this year 's Glaring Omissions . Although her movie , " The Prince of Tides , " won a best- picture nod , the mighty Streisand did n't place as a best director finalist  --  despite a prestigious nomination from the Directors Guild of America . <p> ANTI-FEMALE BIAS ? <p> Was it " anti-Streisand sentiment , " as some say , that left Barbra in the cold ? Or a pervasive anti-female bias among the Academy 's overwhelmingly male directors ' branch ? Director Randa Haines was denied a nomination in 1986 , even though her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competed as best picture . And Penny Marshall was twice touted as a front runner , for " Big " ( 1988 ) and " Awakenings " ( 1990 ) , and twice ignored . <p> In its 64-year history , the Academy has nominated only one woman as best director : Italy 's Lina Wertmuller , for 1976 's " Seven Beauties . " <p> Surprises were scarce in the best actor category . Beatty 's flashy role as the charming but deadly " Bugsy " Siegel was expected , as were Anthony Hopkins ' serial cannibal in " The Silence of the Lambs , " Nick Nolte 's childhood-scarred football coach in " Prince of Tides " and Robin Williams ' verse-spouting schizophrenic in " The Fisher King . " <p> Only Robert De Niro , the avenging psychopath in " Cape Fear , " was slightly surprising  --  not because De Niro was n't powerful in the role , but because the film was roundly scorned for its excess of Gothic violence . This marks De Niro 's sixth nomination , his third in a Martin Scorsese film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narcoleptic hustler in " My Own Private Idaho " was a noble also-ran , as were William Hurt 's chastened surgeon in " The Doctor " and Val Kilmer 's doomed rock star Jim Morrison in ' The Doors . " <p> THE FIVE WOMEN <p> Best actress nominees were easily predicted , with the exception of Laura Dern 's splendid work as an oversexed Southern teenager in " Rambling Rose . " Dern competes with Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon 's Arkansas housewives on the lam in " Thelma &; Louise , " Jodie Foster 's brave FBI recruit in " The Silence of the Lambs " and Bette Midler 's Mother Courage in greasepaint in the box-office flop " For the Boys . " <p> Out of luck : Annette Bening 's nervy gangster 's moll in " Bugsy " was a surprising omission . And do n't forget Michelle Pfeiffer 's frumpy waitress in " Frankie and Johnny , " Kathy Bates ' rebellious housewife in " Fried Green Tomatoes " and two wonderful British performers : Alison Steadman 's cheerful mum in " Life Is Sweet " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Deeply . " <p> The best supporting actor pack had a surprise in Tommy Lee Jones ' nomination for " JFK . " Jones , cast against type as Clay Shaw , a New Orleans homosexual charged with conspiring to assassinate President Kennedy , was never mentioned , as far as I know , as a possible contender . He competes with Harvey Keitel and Ben Kingsley , who played mobsters Mickey Cohen and Meyer Lansky , respectively , in " Bugsy " ; Michael Lerner 's overbearing studio chief ( this year 's hammiest nominee ) in " Barton Fink " and Jack Palance 's old cowpoke in " City Slickers . " <p> Palance is this year 's Oscar comeback kid : It 's his first nomination in 38 years . <p> Gross miscarriage of justice : For my money , none of the nominees can hold a candle to two exquisite but overlooked performances : Robert Duvall 's sexually tempted Southern father in " Rambling Rose " and Samuel L. Jackson 's explosive crack addict in " Jungle Fever . " There ought a be a law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , headed by Diane Ladd 's spiritually inclined mother in " Rambling Rose , " Juliette Lewis ' restless teenager in " Cape Fear , " Mercedes Ruehl 's low-class girlfriend in " The Fisher King , " Kate Nelligan 's embattled mother in " The Prince of Tides " and Jessica Tandy 's delightful octogenarian in " Fried Green Tomatoes . " <p> Left in the dust : Maggie Smith 's Granny Wendy in " Hook , " Jane Horrocks ' bulimic British teen in " Life Is Sweet " and Judy Davis ' sardonic junkie in " Naked Lunch . " <p> Another shocker was elimination of several critical darlings from the documentary feature category . Where were " Paris Is Burning , " the story of New York 's gay drag balls , or " Hearts of Darkness , " the tale of Francis Coppola 's ordeal in making " Apocalypse Now " ? Or Michael Apted 's " 35 Up " ? <p> Academy president Karl Malden and actress Kathleen Turner announced the Oscar nominations during a pre-dawn ceremony at Academy headquarters in Beverly Hills . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Music Center , when comedian Billy Crystal again hosts the live ABC-TV telecast . <p> Here are the other nominees announced yesterday : <p> ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY  --  John Singleton , " Boyz N the Hood " ; James Toback , " Bugsy " ; Richard LaGravenese , " The Fisher King " ; Meg and Lawrence Kasdan , " Grand Canyon " ; Callie Khouri , " Thelma &; Louise .
