<p> On paper , San Francisco 's Target Cities grant last November looked like a windfall : $ 11 million over five years from the federal government to fight drug abuse . <p> A new computer system would link the 80 or so clinics that now exist . Addicts would receive thorough tests to place them in the most appropriate treatment . Social worker SWAT teams would search out people who need help . <p> But after 10 months of committee meetings and implementation plans , the program still has not treated one addict . There is no guarantee that , citywide , more people will be helped . Target Cities has not even found a building in which to set up shop . <p> In a city with long waiting lists for drug treatment , the delays are especially frustrating . Health care advocates say the real problem is not the local bureaucracy . Instead , they see Target Cities as a too-vivid example of how when Washington pays the bills , it also writes the rules  --  even if the results favor trendy innovations over basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have good management , but what we need is more money for treatment , " said Ronald Kletter , executive director of Bay Area Addiction Research and Treatment . " Right now we 're literally busting at the seams . " <p> A casual observer would have assumed help was on the way when city officials announced with pride that they had won $ 11 million to help treat substance abusers . <p> In fact , things never were that simple . <p> The federal government offered the money only to cities that would take the idea of managed care  --  standardized tests , monitoring of patients , a close eye on whether treatments actually work  --  and apply it to the community health programs that now provide care to the addicts who are most difficult to reach , from homeless people to low-income mothers and AIDs patients . <p> And that is what San Francisco 's Department of Health proposed : a sleek system that would use computers and common procedures to organize the current loose network of service providers , ranging from the Salvation Army to the Friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve roughly 15,000 patients . <p> " Target Cities will provide the technological infrastructure that will enable San Francisco to maximize the use of its scarce treatment resources , " the grant proposal last year promised in glowing bureaucratese . <p> The emphasis on management infuriates critics , who instead want any new money to go directly to services . <p> " This grant is all about process and research , " said Paul Boden of the Coalition on Homelessness , the program 's most vocal opponent . " They can say ' we brought in $ 11 million for substance abuse treatment , ' but it does n't accomplish anything . " <p> Rather than chase any grant that becomes available , Boden would like to see the city lobby the federal government to change its priorities . <p> " The city should only apply for money that would augment services , " Boden said . " Use the energy instead to make the case in Washington that these grants are not relevant for what we need . " <p> A HOPE FOR EFFICIENCY <p> City officials respond by saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once will be less likely to return . So even if extra treatment slots are not created , the current slots will be put to more efficient use . <p> " This is major systemic change , " said project director Yvonne Frazier . " If we do our job right , we 'll get the client who needs services to the appropriate level of care . " <p> Target Cities does not ignore treatment : 25 percent of each year 's grant , the most allowed under federal rules , will go to clinics . But the other three-quarters of the money is reserved for testing clients and operating the management system  --  although Frazier is quick to say that assessment and counseling are also basic services . <p> Still , people seeking detox programs often spend two weeks or more on waiting lists . Even as they defend the program , city officials who won the grant  --  beating out San Jose and Oakland among other cities  --  say they would spend the money differently if strings were not attached . <p> " Initially , we had some problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Health Department official who headed the city 's substance abuse treatment efforts until this summer . " There 's a problem with the logic when system improvements get approved , but there 's little emphasis on system expansion . " <p> Besides San Francisco , 18 other cities are Target Cities . Together they will receive $ 34.8 million this year from the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment , which created the program in 1990 . <p> The center has no ambivalence about the wisdom of the Target Cities approach . <p> " Case management , when carried out at a state-of-the-art level , in itself keeps people involved in treatment and recovery , " said Lisa Scheckel , the center 's deputy director . " The imperative to treat more people has existed at the expense of quality . . . The goal here is to stop the revolving door that characterizes some of our metropolitan services . " <p> A PENDULUM 'S SWING <p> But experienced observers say Washington operates on the pendulum principle : pilot programs are hailed as innovations and copied widely , then fall out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years there 's a new fad , " said Drew Altman , president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation in Menlo Park . " Usually you 've got the convergence of what is felt to be a legitimate need , and an entrepreneurial bureaucrat who wants a notch on his or her belt . " <p> Especially when grants are tight , Altman said . " In a world where there is n't much new money for services , everyone is driven to make it do more . " <p> The result ? The type of debate sparked by Target Cities . One side says good management will solve the problems , the other says money is wasted on bureaucrats . <p> " It 's a classic fight , " Altman said . " There 's good reason to be skeptical when you hear the word ' coordination ' . . . on the other hand , some programs work and some are no more than rip-offs , so you need accountability . " <p> Clark takes the debate in stride  --  in part because Target Cities already has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal machinery . <p> " The city should n't throw out the funding because it does n't exactly fill the need , " Clark said . " This program is a magnet . . . Target Cities has stimulated our ability to go after other resources . " <p> MANY SOURCES FOR FINANCING <p> For instance , Target Cities has a contract to test people entering the Social Security program for drug-related disabilities . It has applied for Head Start funds to take care of children while parents are in treatment . Also , improbably , it has become the lead agency for the city 's new drug court  --  a federally-blessed effort to offer nonviolent drug users treatment instead of jail time . <p> " Every time you add a new link , there 's a twist , " Frazier said . " There 's a rough and tumble to this , but you do it . " <p> Local clinics , meanwhile , wait for the program to begin . Few voice outright skepticism  --  perhaps because of a reluctance to bite the hand that may someday write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest . <p> " I do n't recall any groundswell for coordination , " said Peter Jamero , executive director of Asian American Recovery Services . " This does raise the hope of additional dollars for treatment , and a push for more culturally competent intake and outreach staff . . . I use the word ' hope , ' not ' expectation . ' " <p> And just like city officials , clinic operators hope Target Cities will be bait for capturing other grants . <p> " If we show we can flourish under a managed central system , access to federal money might improve , " said Keith Folger , program director for Acceptance Place . " Dollars are dwindling . "
