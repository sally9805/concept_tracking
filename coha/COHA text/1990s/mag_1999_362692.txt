In late 1991 , AKIO MORITA , a colleague on the Trilateral Commission and a longtime friend , told me he was concerned about the state of U.S.-Japanese relations . In the wake of a series of high-profile acquisitions of American properties , including Rockefeller Center , by Japanese companies , Japan bashing had become somewhat of a national sport in the U.S. , and a tone of superiority had crept into many public pronouncements emanating from Tokyo . Akio proposed that the two of us attempt to counter this trend through " dialogue " that would be taped for TV and then published in Japan . His purpose was to remind his fellow citizens of their enduring political , economic and cultural links to the U.S. The two of us  --  along with a retinue of TV technicians  --  spent a fascinating day at my home in Westchester County , N.Y. , discussing this and other matters . Our day together had a great effect on me personally  --  and I believe a positive impact on Japanese attitudes toward the U.S.  --  for it gave me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasp of world affairs and his wide-ranging knowledge of art . He had a profound commitment to international cooperation from his years as a young man in the U.S. during the difficult postwar period . It is Akio 's wisdom , his candor about issues that truly matter and his great warmth and humanity that I will greatly miss . <P>  --  DAVID ROCKEFELLER
