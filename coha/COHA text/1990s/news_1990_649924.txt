<p> To the Editor : <p> You have recently published opinions critical of so-called " big science , " including the Human Genome Project . The project is nothing like the " big science " research and development initiatives with which it is continually compared . <p> First , the Human Genome Project is not a large piece of hardware located in a single place to be operated by a single group . More than a hundred laboratories in every corner of the continent will participate in the project . Most genome project laboratories will contain about the same number of workers as any typical biomedical research lab . <p> Second , the Human Genome Project can not fail . Each step we take en route to our ultimate goals will make it easier for scientists to find genes . Like the system of interstate highways spanning our country , the map of the human genome will be completed stretch by stretch , beginning now . <p> Our first major goal , to construct a fully connected system of maps of each of the human chromosomes , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human DNA to the genes they are so eager to find . Biomedical investigation will flow along any part of those pathways as soon as complete , well before the entire system is mapped . <p> Thousands of human diseases have their roots in malfunctioning genes , and many others have strong genetic co-factors . Despite exciting recent successes , tracking down genes is now a difficult task . Using current chromosome maps , gene hunts are long , arduous and enormously expensive . Just ask the people who have done it . Discovery of the cystic fibrosis gene - an " easy " find according to those scientists - took seven years at a very high cost . Sadly and more typically , the eight-year search for the devastating Huntington 's disease gene has yet to bring forth the villain , despite the vigorous efforts of a cadre of superb scientists . For diseases resulting from the interactions of more than one gene , discovering the underlying genetic factors will be impossible without a detailed map . Researchers studying a roundworm have mapped 95 percent of its genome . Such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gene in that animal from a year to merely weeks . It is possible today to construct similar maps of human chromosomes . A central goal of the Human Genome Project is to deliver those human maps over the next five years to the research community so scientists can get on with the study of how genes work , in both health and disease . <p> The National Institutes of Health invests in the search for genes because we believe having a gene in hand is the first step in the characterization of molecular defects that result in disease . Progress in understanding the causes of cancer , forexample , has been pushed forward tremendously by the discovery of cancer genes . We must now make deliberate efforts to surmount the next technological hurdles that keep scientists from understanding the molecular essence of other tragic and devastating illnesses like schizophrenia , Alzheimer 's disease , alcoholism and manic depression . <p> Once genes are found , their alterations and defects are analyzed by DNA sequencing to give us their specific structures . Current technology is still too slow and costly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of one human chromosome . To fulfill its ultimate goal of sequencing the three billion subunits of human DNA , the Human Genome Project must stimulate development of faster and cheaper sequencing technologies . Large-scale sequencing is not scheduled to begin until the cost of sequencing is reduced significantly , to less than $1 per subunit . <p> More efficient sequencing technologies will make laboratory life infinitely easier for the many biomedical researchers longing to know the secrets locked away in a lengthy DNA strand they painstakingly isolated . The ability to sequence DNA quickly and cheaply will also provide the technological basis for a new era in drug development . DNA sequences contain the information necessary to synthesize human gene products in the laboratory . The Human Genome Project will greatly accelerate the speed at which important " natural " drugs such as the already available tissue plasminogen activator , erythropoietin and interferon become available to patients . <p> The concept of a Human Genome Project received several rigorous reviews by independent scientific panels . Each of these committees , which contained members initially opposed to the project , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the advancement of United States science , industry and public health . The amount of money we ask to accomplish the task , $200 million a year , is commensurate with the project 's role in the fight against many serious health problems . The contributions the Human Genome Project will make to the full range of biomedical research the N.I.H. supports makes it an economical , worthwhile investment .
