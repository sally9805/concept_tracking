<p> IT was stodgy . It trudged along slowly . But for 50 years , the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade pushed global trade barriers lower , stimulating both commerce and world economic growth . <p> Can its successor organization , the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , continue that progress ? <p> " It has had a credible first year , " says Gary Hufbauer , a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics , a Washington think tank . <p> " The machinery is running . But we do n't know what the output will be . It is too early to tell , " he says . <p> In the tough , often bitter realm of trade management , the WTO is off to a predictably slow start : <p> * The Geneva-based organization sports a new dispute-resolution process . But of 21 pending trade disputes from bananas to grain , no rulings have been made . <p> * Last year 's biggest trade dispute , between the United States and Japan over automobiles , was not even brought before the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the new umpire 's rules . <p> * WTO members have not finished talks on admitting Russia and China as members . <p> * Nor has the new trade body concluded negotiations in certain areas of business not dealt with by the huge Uruguay Round trade agreement , signed in April 1994 . <p> Some of these new areas are important : telecommunications , financial services , and audiovisual goods . <p> But if the pace is slow and the style not pretty , the results of trade liberalization have been stunning : In the 45 years up to 1994 , trade in goods posted a 14-fold increase . That boom fueled a more-than five-fold rise in global output of merchandise . <p> The Uruguay Round , the last and hardest of eight negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , expanded the GATT 's scope to include trade in services and intellectual-property rights . The Uruguay Round also gave the world 's trade umpire the name originally planned in 1944 for a similar organization - the WTO . ( No organization of that name was created in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did create the International Monetary Fund and World Bank . ) The conferees could not agree and the GATT was formed only in 1948 . <p> Undoubtedly the WTO will face its share of clashes as it deals with various trade disputes . Trade issues are too important politically to be bargained over with ease . <p> Power struggle <p> For example , when the WTO had to select seven members for an appellate body for trade disputes , the trading body soon found itself mired in politics . <p> Both the European Union ( EU ) and the United States wanted two seats each on the panel , which may have the final say on some trade disputes . This caused most other member nations and customs territories to raise more than their eyebrows . It seemed that the titans of trade were already trying to dominate the infant WTO . <p> " Having the EU and the US in a dominant position just would n't have flown , " said Don Kenyon , Australia 's ambassador to the WTO and chairman of the dispute-settlement body . " Since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are involved in the most disputes . It would have smacked too much of the robber in charge of the bank . " <p> Finally , the US and the EU agreed to one seat each . This compromise , reached last fall , may have actually strengthened America 's position , Mr. Kenyon says . " It shows a willingness on the part of Washington to trust the system , and it increases the moral authority of the US in the system . " <p> But America apparently did n't trust the new system to resolve its longstanding auto dispute with Japan . <p> If the Clinton administration had done so , it might have revealed weaknesses in the WTO 's problem-solving power , says Bruce Stokes , senior fellow and director of trade programs at the Council on Foreign Relations . Had Washington won a judgment against Tokyo , and the WTO instructed Japan to liberalize its auto-parts procurement and auto-sales market , " you can assume that Japan would have put its domestic concerns above all else and failed to comply , " Mr. Stokes says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world was basically an outlaw . " If the WTO had ruled against Washington , he adds , American popular support for the WTO , already in question , would have fallen through the floor . " People would be asking : ' What good is this thing ? ' " <p> If it is n't perfect , the new dispute-resolution process does give the WTO greater power than the former system . <p> New dispute process <p> Trade differences brought before the WTO and not resolved within 60 days go to a panel of trade experts . The panel recommends an action based on global trade rules . If one of the disputants disagrees with the panel 's legal interpretation of the trade rules , it can go to the appellate body , which has 60 days to reach a decision . This decision is binding , and any country refusing to abide by the decision will be subject to WTO-authorized trade sanctions . <p> The US was the principal architect of this new dispute mechanism . <p> " We were frustrated with the old system , " said Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We brought and won most disputes in the old system , but the losing parties always delayed . The WTO dispute settlement is designed to satisfy those parties who win . " <p> Whereas the GATT applied only to the trade of goods , the WTO covers goods , services and intellectual property . <p> " The whole trading system is now centered on the WTO , " says John Jackson , a trade expert at the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor . " It makes it easier for goods to cross borders without government intervention and reduces government tariffs , or taxes . That offers consumers more diversity and more choice of products that just was n't available 20 or 30 years ago . " <p> For example , recently a specialty shop opened in Ann Arbor offering a vast array of imported cheeses and wine , Professor Jackson says . And in Europe , one can now buy a US farm-raised turkey . <p> The hitch comes when nations do n't agree on how to interpret trade treaties . <p> For example , the US wants Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EU has banned imported meat with certain added hormones . In the US , these are certified as safe for human consumption . The EU says it is just heeding the call of consumers who do n't want hormones in their meat . This spat will likely go before the WTO . <p> Bananas are another case : South American bananas rarely reach the market in most European countries . Not because banana splits are considered unappetizing , but because EU quotas favor some former European colonies . This policy has gotten under the skin of the US , Guatemala , Honduras , and Mexico , which have asked the WTO dispute body to consider the issue . <p> Of the 21 disputes brought to the WTO so far , the US is involved in 10 . <p> The first panel decision , expected by the end of January , involves Venezuelan and Brazilian complaints about US pollution standards for petroleum . The case illustrates a hot-button issue for WTO critics : that basic environmental and labor standards are not set in current global trade treaties . But how to include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the roughly 110 WTO members has one vote . So each nation carries a degree of clout . But in practice , Mr. Stoler says , " The EU , Japan , and the US are much more important than others . While a country might do something Senegal or Norway would n't approve of , it would n't think of doing it if the US was n't part of the deal . " <p> Some big nations have yet to join - a fact that highlights how unfinished the organization is . China has long sought to enter the world trade mainstream , and recently it announced major tariff cuts to win its way into the WTO . But its formal entry , clouded in part by political concerns , appears some way off .
