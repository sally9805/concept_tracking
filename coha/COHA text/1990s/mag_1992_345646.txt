Peace talks or no , the Middle East is once again showing its true color : the blood red of vengeance . The escalation of violence began Feb. 14 when Arab guerrillas infiltrated an Israeli army camp and hacked three soldiers to death . Two days later in southern Lebanon , Israeli Apache helicopters fired three missiles on the motorcade of Sheik Abbas Musawi , leader of the Iranian- backed Hizballah . The long-planned strike killed not only Musawi but also his wife and six-year-old son . From there , hostilities spiraled rapidly . Hizballah launched scores of Katyusha rockets into Israel 's self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon and into the Galilee panhandle of Israel proper . The Jewish state fired back on about 20 Lebanese villages , then sent a column of armored vehicles beyond the security zone toward two Hizballah strongholds , Kafra and Yater , where eight U.N . peacekeepers were wounded in the cross fire . <P> While no one could say when the dismally familiar spiral of violence might end , Jerusalem maintained repeatedly from the start that its attacking forces were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On Friday the . troops were pulled back to the security zone , but officials promised they would return if Hizballah did not halt its rocket attacks . <P> Much to Washington 's relief , Israel 's actions seemed to have no disruptive impact on the Middle East peace process .

Only the Palestinians , incensed by Israel 's recent detention of two of their delegates , threatened not to show  --  then reversed course . <P> In taking out Musawi , Israel 's leaders knew that they risked diplomatic opprobrium  --  as well as retaliation from Hizballah . So why did they hit him ? Before Musawi took command of Hizballah in mid-1991 , he was a member of its military command , which Israel holds responsible for such atrocities as the 1983 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Israel entertained hopes that he might pursue a more moderate course , since he had close ties to Iran 's more pragmatic leaders . But attacks by his militia on Israeli targets only increased . After two previous failed attempts on his life , the Israelis hit him last week because he was there , just where they knew he would be when he publicized his plans to attend a memorial service in the village of Jibshit . " There is a legitimate principle called settling an account , " says Yossi Peled , former head of Israel 's northern command .
