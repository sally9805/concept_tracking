<p> She arranged the monthly bills in neat little stacks on the tray that had been rolled to her hospital bedside . Her checkbook sat on the nightstand . <p> Sara Peters was ready to balance accounts . <p> In the evening , she would pay her monthly obligations . The next morning , the 31-year-old employee benefits specialist would undergo elective surgery at Porter Memorial Hospital - elective surgery in the sense that Sara elected to keep her father alive , independent of kidney dialysis ' onerous ritual . <p> And elective in the sense that her health insurance treated the decision to donate a kidney " the same as if I was having my boobs done , " Sara said . <p> She seemed agitated not so much by urgency as eagerness , a desire to move forward with a transplant that already had been postponed once , when her dad ran a fever that forced last-minute cancellation and a churning mix of anger and disappointment . It had been a long , emotional road since Sara began preliminary testing in December to determine if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once again , they were back at the brink . <p> " I used to joke with him when I was leaving work and there 'd be a bad storm going on , " Sara said . " I 'd say , ' I 'm leaving now and heading up C-470 and then north on I-25 . If there 's a bad accident , come get my kidney . " ' <p> Actually , she 'd already made her dad a serious offer . But Jerry Peters , a 60-year-old insurance actuary who does consulting work , had turned it down , saying he simply could n't imagine submitting his own child - his only biological child among five daughters , and therefore the best match possibility - to the painful burden of transplant surgery . He would continue the dismal holding pattern dictated by dialysis until a viable cadaver donor surfaced . <p> It was that or die . <p> Jerry inherited polycystic kidney disease , a terminal disorder that , before dialysis , normally claimed its victims in their 50s . He looked it up in an old New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PKD killed his mother and it killed her mother . <p> It was even odds he would pass on the disease to Sara , but she dodged the bullet . And since PKD does n't skip a generation , the family 's killing gene will die with Jerry . He was diagnosed at 35 and , true to form , PKD shut down his kidneys about two years ago . <p> In June of 1993 he got on an every-other-day dialysis regimen . Four months later , he got on the transplant list . <p> He figured he could do a year on dialysis - despite the pain , the tedium , the inconvenience and the way it played havoc with a heavy travel schedule for work . A year passed , and the phone never rang . <p> A few more months passed , and still the elements of tragedy , compatibility and pecking order did not combine to produce a suitable cadaver-donated kidney . The fruitless wait reflected a national shortage of transplant organs , owing partly to willing , prospective donors not making their wishes known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned he might actually be looking at a wait of another two years . Suddenly , his daughter 's offer merited another hard look . <p> " I remember I 'd just started a new job , " said Sara , " and I called to tell him . I asked him how he was , and he said , ' Terrible . ' He 's never said that . I sat there crying , thinking he must be really bad to say so . " <p> She continued the battery of tests that would determine whether her kidney would make a good match for her father . They indicated that it would be adequate , but one particular procedure hinted that the transplant might truly be blessed . <p> Doctors took an arteriogram of her kidneys , a picture of the intricate network of blood vessels produced by injecting dye into the bloodstream . As the results flashed on a video screen , Sara noticed the arterial lines in one kidney appeared to form a face . <p> " The face of Jesus ! " exclaimed her 8-year-old daughter Meghann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . She said her mom wanted to take a printout of the arteriogram to church to show that prayers had been answered . <p> " I 'm going to send it to the World Weekly News , " Sara announced . " Maybe I can beat out the Bigfoot story of the week . " <p> It had been one of the few moments when levity figured into the transplant process . Sara sat on the third-floor hospital bed and considered the decision that had brought her there - the feelings of love and obligation and selfishness that seemed separate yet also connected by the overriding desire to restore life to the man who had given her life . <p> The choice to donate one kidney in a procedure that entailed no more risk for her than childbirth - she 'd done that three times - was at once simple and complex . <p> " It 's love of my dad , " Sara explained . " And it 's my own personal belief that I had to make every effort to not give up and lose hope . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it 's me being selfish , because I do n't know how I could face myself if I could do it and did n't . Think about what parents go through for their children . Comparatively , this is a minor thing . <p> " The third part of my rationalization is my children . I want them to know my dad and remember him . There are more Rockies games to go to , more cookouts in the back yard - things they should do with their grandpa . " <p> About an hour earlier , Jerry had walked down from his room two floors above and told his daughter that the final test results were in and the operation looked like a go . It was her last chance to back out . She literally jumped for joy . <p> It was an emotional moment and might have gotten even more emotional . But Jerry headed for the door after laying an envelope on Sara 's bed . He told her not to open it until he left . He has never been one for tearful scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , " Your sacrifice and your generosity will allow me to once again enjoy the wonder of life as a young boy might - what a gift ! Much thanks , and much love . " <p> Behind the half-closed door of his room , Jerry Peters was finishing a long conversation with his surgeon . He signed the papers that spelled out the risks of transplant surgery - the " oops form " he called it - and handed them back . <p> " Well , doc , " he smiled , " you just sold another used car . " <p> The major league All-Star Game played soundlessly on the television above his bed - not surprising in the room of an inveterate baseball fan who scheduled his first , ultimately aborted transplant attempt specifically for a stretch when the Colorado Rockies were on a long road trip . <p> Earlier that afternoon , he had watched and listened to Hall-of-Famer Mickey Mantle give a press conference updating the progress of his celebrated - and controversial - liver transplant . Questions still swirled around the question of whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tint to a brilliant career , had received preferential treatment in receiving a new liver within two days of going on the national waiting list . <p> The discussion caught Jerry in a particularly philosophical moment , on the evening before his own daughter would end a wait that might have continued for years . He felt ambivalence . <p> " I do n't know if Mickey Mantle has money or does n't , if he got special treatment or not , " Jerry said . " But there 's a value to Mickey Mantle getting a liver transplant . Look at the publicity . There are some negatives , but if it works , it tells people it can work and improves awareness . " <p> The Mantle saga seemed an outgrowth of Jerry 's own introspection , the kind of hard look at values and costs that did n't sound unusual coming from an actuary who does consulting for health plans . What would his kidney transplant mean in the bigger picture of society and medical costs and hard choices ? <p> " There 's a bad side to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 6,000 a month . A kidney transplant is about $ 30,000 , plus $ 500 or $ 600 a month for drugs for the rest of your life . If I live another two years , another 10 years , is that worth the benefit we might have gotten from spending that money on dental care for 500 kids ? " <p> These are the big dilemmas , and he did n't presume to know the answers , at least not beyond the intense feeling of responsibility that he be useful and productive for whatever stretch his transplant might allow . But not long ago , the thorny question of whether to accept a kidney from his daughter dissolved into one painfully obvious response . <p> The burden of dialysis felt too diminishing to endure . He recalled reading an obituary for a woman he 'd met at the center where he got treatment and later learned that she 'd just quit . She 'd simply had enough . She died five days later . The doctor told Jerry that a man in his condition might last a month if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be his ace-in-the-hole all along . Jerry played his last card . <p> " I 'd crashed , " he admitted . " I 'd hit the wall . I needed her . Now , there are no doubts . I need it . She knows I need it . It was time to be honest . <p> " I was ready to give it up . " <p> Jerry Peters woke up from surgery feeling like a man who 'd just gotten a great deal on a used car . Sara would have woken up sore if the epidural had n't kicked in with its wonderful numbness . <p> In his room two days after the operation , Jerry 's face was full of color . <p> " I 've been using the phrase ' kick ass ' a lot , " he grinned . <p> In her room , Sara had color , too . From the flower arrangements . <p> " I do n't want him to know how sore I am , " she moaned . <p> Doctors were thrilled with the way the surgery had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was showering and shaving himself the day after . She was having a rougher time but still glowing with the pleasure of her contribution . <p> " It 's like new life , " Jerry said . <p> " It 's like he 's three-dimensional again , " Sara said . " I 'm whining to the nurses . Dad wants to go dance the tango on tables . " <p> But her father 's sudden , visible return to vitality took the edge off her pain . And his remarkable turnabout had him thinking that if more people knew what transplants could do and bothered to talk about it with their families , there might not be 40,000 people still waiting for organs and feeling the desperation he 'd felt . <p> " I made a little list , " he said , contemplating the things he wanted to enjoy in good health . " I made it months ago when I was depressed because I thought I 'd never get a cadaver kidney . The main thing is I love my work , I have a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only go to so many ballgames . Besides , if society spends all this money on me , this allocation of resources , I better not misuse it . " <p> Jerry looked ahead on his calendar , scanning the 42-day window when the possibility of rejection looms highest and noting one other significant date . <p> " August 3rd , " he said . " An afternoon game . I think it 's San Diego . " <p> Kevin Simpson 's column appears on Tuesday , Thursday and Sunday . Write to him via e-mail at KScott56@aol.com.
