Our first close glimpses of our neighbor planets have shown them full of surprises . And the closer we look . . . Begin a ghostly plain Dim white in pale starlight . Flat as Jar as you can see To where a distant black ridge Divides reality Above the stars shine Below the ground crunches Hillary , By Peary and Amundsen , Are your guides . It is beautiful But you can not stop long ; The plain is life itself Move on now , trod onward , Or stand and freeze , they say . - WB . I am in the middle of a line of peopie walking determinedly across the most everything-forsaken boring waste in the Solar System . I am so sore and tired I could scream-if there were a warm bed around somewhere , I 'd crawl in it to shudder . My attitude has hit rock bottom , but it is time to file my report and if I want anything good out of this pain , I 'd best sound positive : " I am Wojciech Bubka , college teacher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a breath of sterile suit air , " . . . guide to the natural universe , courtesy of the Solar System Astrographic Society and its many sponsors and members .

" Come with me while there are still such places to explore-for as we approach the twenty-third century , this frontier , too , is receding . " I try to gain a little ground to stop briefly and pan my helmet cam over the dirty ice field . Despite the exertion , the change of pace lifts my spirits a bit . But not even a ten-to-one vertical exaggeration will make this landscape interesting . Come on , Bubka . You 're a poet ? Find meaning .

Such is the dream and the experience I seek to share with you here , today , on the frozen wastes of Chao Meng Fu crater on Mercury . " Said strain of muscles gets my attention as I start walking again , and I groan involuntarily . I am tired from the almost week of walking under a pack that brought my weight close to Earth normal-when what is normal for me is Mars . I wiggle my toes as hard as I can-despite vacuum insulation , thermistor environmental control and loose , fluffy socks , I think my feet are beginning to get cold . " Come on , mate . Another hour will get us there . " That is Ed Blake , a gentleman adventurer from New Zealand with Antarctic experience . Ed is my tentmate , lanky , mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reserved-unless he gets that kind of twinkle in his eye . Then beware a terri ble pun . He 's cheerful enough to me , but I sense a certain condescension . Understandable , I think . What the frozen hell am I doing here ? I had been getting bored at Jovis Tholis University . Poetry , these days , includes video as well as text-something which would have delighted Will Shakespeare , I assure you-and has blended with drama so much that we distinguish the two by picking nits over length and symbolic content . But even in its media-inflated majesty , a dozen years of going over the same basic stuff while fighting battles with New Reformation censors and leftwing nihilists-neither of whom take kindly to the display of material contrary to their philosophies-has me well on my way to burnout . JTU is in a dome over an ostensibly extinct volcano on Tharsis , roughly halfway to Olympus Mons from the tether tube terminal on Ascraeus . The location worked , and it became the biggest university on Mars-of which I was an increasingly small and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic became increasingly burdensome , my dreams of " out there " grew . I might teach at Saturn High Station with its magnificent view of the rings . Or I could compose random meter verse at Hyperion institute , the lonely retreat of mathematical philosophers set on a detached mountain peak that careens about Saturn as metaphor of an uncertain future . Or I could volunteer to ride a comet and watch robots turn it into Martian air while writing my epics in the freedom of isolation as the comet fell for a decade into the inner Solar System . Or , and this was my most favorite , I might become a journalist in the old sense on the first expedition to Pluto and Charon . Thus did I dream . But so , of course , dream millions of others . Only a chosen few can go anywhere the first time or do anything the first time . I dabbled at trail writing ; journals of hikes and visits to parts of the vanishing " Red " Mars , but got little notice beyond a reasonably nice " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ System Astrographic Society . I needed an entree , a contact , an idea , something to lift me out of the background . Then , last year ( Martian year , everyone ; almost two standard years ago ) , Miranda Lotati , the daughter of the man in charge of Solar System Astrographic Society 's expeditions division , walked into my literature class at Jovis Tholis University , a junior transfer from Stanford on Earth . She looked to be a hard , vigorous , and exciting person but could barely choke two words out in succession-about as contrary to stereotype as one could be and still have breasts . She was not really beautiful-too muscular , too thin in the face , too boyish a figure , but I saw the possibilities in that . Less competition , and perhaps a complement to my esthetic , well , softness , I told myself . I saw the romance of an attraction of opposites who themselves were opposites of conventionality , and I was looking for some romance somewhere-the women of my normal circles were hopeless and helpless in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that . I saw in her an invitation to beyond and away from here . If I played it right-and I resolved to do so . It was n't easy . Miranda was a roughedged , prickly student , and her essays were condensed dullness , never more than the required length . A spoken sentence of more than a half dozen words was a rarity from her , and she sometimes seemed to speak a language so far evolved from today 's English in its lack of articles and verbs that , had it been deliberate , would have been considered art in some circles . Nonetheless I was intent . I persisted in bringing her along . I bided my time . I had to expend some moral capital , but convinced myself that she covered the ground on her final well enough to let me pass her . She liked me , I think . But I said nothing unethical to her , nor hinted at anything romantic while she was my student-I have my standards . I saw her on the last day of classes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 're off to Mercury , I hear , to be along on your father 's attempt to walk across Chao Meng Fu Crater ? " Shielded from the Sun , that huge crater was an ice field-Mercury 's Antarctica . She nodded . " Have you set the expedition membership ? " She shook her head , confirming what was known publicly . " Will you have any journalists along ? It would make a very exciting nature piece . " She smiled a bit . " Like your Ascraeus Mons hike piece ? Dad liked that and sent me here . " He 'd seen that ? I tried to remember the rejection letter . I was flattered but a bit worried that it was a little light for a Lotati expedition . Then the alarm bells rang in my head . My competition for the position of expedition bard was standing in front of me . I reached for a tone of professorial authority . " Randi , uh . You 've come a long way in your composition . . . " She shrugged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do the article . Someone who fits on the team . Wish I wrote better . " " Randi , I suppose I should n't be obscure . Is there any chance I might come myself ? " Her eyes lit up for a moment , then she frowned . " Rough business , exploring . " " Then my accounts of it should draw interest , maybe enough to push Solar System Astrographic 's allocation priorities a little further up . " Not to mention that a single Astrographic article could bring in the equivalent in allocations of my entire Jovis Tholus University stipend for a year . A Martian year . " Uh , huh . " A doubtful assent on her part " Might even help you get to your namesake , out by Uranus . Now there would be an angle that people would notice ! " That got her attention . " Dad 's idea too . My name . Not that easy , though . No place for amateurs , out there . I smiled at her . " I bet I 'll make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in reasonably good shape . " She gave me a somewhat skeptical look and a sigh . " Mercury first . Chao Meng Fu . Hundred fifty kilometerwide . Never sees the Sun . Covered with granite-hard permafrost . Probably take us two , three weeks to walk it . " " Walk ? " everything . Yacuum suits , tents , sup She nodded . Unassisted . Carry everything . Vacuum suits , tents , supplies , samples . " " Walk it ? Uh , why ? " She looked at me as if I was born in some other cosmos . " Because we can . " There is this recklessness about me that allows me to throw words around without fully considering the consequences . " Well , I think I can too . I 've done enough hiking around Tharsis-I even have a cinder cone named after me . " She looked skeptically at me . " Oh ? How high ? " She had me there . I grinned sheepishly . " Well , " Bubka Mons " is only a hundred meters above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's nothing else around it . " And I knew someone in the Martian Geology Institute that was laying out the local real estate . She giggled . It is registered , Randi . Anyway , my Ascraeus trip was solo , and by a new route . " She looked judiciously at me and sighed . " Lose ten kilos . Do fifty kDometers a day . " We stood silent for a couple of seconds as I tried to digest that . She turned away . " Physics finalsee you . " And she was gone , gliding easily down the hall . Dreams are free ; but realizing them has a price . And I resolved to pay it . By the end of last semester , I had walked up a few Martian mountains and lost the ten kilos . I talked to her again and we arranged a checkout hike down to the base of Jovis Tholis and back up to the town again with full packs , breather gear , and by the most difficult route she could pick . She watched every move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " date . " As this went on , I grew utterly fascinated with her . She was a busy woman . Reporters called her , outfitters called her . She was always meeting young women explorers who knew her reputation as a companion of her father , and old men explorers who had been somewhere with her father . My metaphor for Randi was a black hole ; people and things seem to swirl around and accrete to her without any significant verbal effort on her part , as if her presence distorts space so that all roads simply lead to her and none away . The week she was to leave Mars for Mercury she called me . " You 're in , Professor Bubka . Can you make the Shannon inbound ? Friday ? " By moving heaven and Mars , I could , and did . I had , it seemed , been within her event horizon for some time now . So , Mercury . Mercury gravity is the same as Mars gravity , which some say is more than a coincidence , but a coincidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as on Mars , but I 'm carrying three times my mass in supplies and vacuum survival equipment . I might as well be hiking in Antarctica with a light pack . Indeed , I could use the conditioning to visit Earth ! Despite the extra mass , we try to keep up the fifty kilometers a day-a pace I must maintain . There are eight of us strung out along the Chao Meng Fu crater floor Dr. Lotati in the lead . Dr Juanita Terzo , a Harvard-trained geologist , follows him . Juanita is actually on the JTU faculty-in the Martian Geology Institute-but I had to come to Mercury to meet her . Randi follows her . Then comes Ed , myself , and one of Dr. Tierzo 's graduate students , Eloni Wakhweya , a slight Kenyan woman with a big grin . Solar System Astrographic expedition staffers Mike and Karen Svenson come last , pulling an equipment pallet on two large wire wheels . They meant it ; no robots , no powered vehicles , and in my now humbled opinion , no sense . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the spacesuits and all their built-in communications and amenities , too . I 'm exhausted , uncomfortable , and increasingly uneasy with this exercise in cosmic hubris . The view is simple , unrelieved flatness , the kind of view that should reach one 's soul in the way of all great expanses . The crater 's stark lines go its namesake 's art one spareness better ; the vertical dimension is almost absent . It too is painted in an ink of five colors , all gray . It is Aldrin 's magnificent desolation , without relief . I appreciate it more in intellectual abstract than in person . There is light to see : the tips of the peaks behind us blaze like distant arc lamps , and fill the bowl of Chao Meng Fu with a ghostly kind of moonlight . Small , rounded crater rims dot this frozen plane-very few higher than a man , for ice flows in time . The brighter stars shine down on us hard and free . Brilliant Earth hangs just over the horizon , a tiny dazzling bluewhite star . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dot lost in Sagittarius . Invisible to us in the Earth 's glare is the beginning of Earth 's Sunshield . This mammoth project will partly shade the heat-polluted atmosphere from the fires of Apollo 's chariot someday . It is taking form at the EarthSun L-1 point , balanced there with the help of reflected light-they plan to reduce insolation by 1 percent . But more relevant to our endeavor is that it is the home of Solar System Astrographic 's solar radio antenna , which we use to apprise the rest of the Solar System of the status of this madcap adventure . I look that way wondering why I ever left . " Another five kilometers to the crevasse , " Dr. Lotati tells us on the comnet . This desolate flat sameness is an illusion ; we have real work ahead . The crevasse is a major obstacle , or a major objective if you are a geologist . Halfway between the rim of Chao Meng Fu crater and its central peaks lies a huge crack in the permafrost caused , they think , by an almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the billion-year-old impact that formed the crater . To this poet , overhead views make the crevasse looks like the mouth of the planet-and I worry about being devoured . By noon , universal time , the mouth of Mercury yawns directly in front of us , an ugly black crack that makes the dark gray plain around us look silvery by comparison . We halt to plan our crossing . Juanita proposes that we simply go down into this thing , down into a darkness that has never known the Sun , and out again on the other side . That idea creates enough interest to scare me . But not now . A descent will take planning , and , in the meantime , I luxuriate in not having to move my body . Yet , standing still , I forget my pain and become curious . The crevasse seems to run to the horizon to my right and left . The other side is the length of a football field away . I shudder-it is impossible to repress the thought that such darkness is not meant for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious and punish us for trying it . Perversely , the challenge of that danger attracts me . Yet , there are reasons to go down beyond the simple thrill of it . Solar Astrographic 's expedition is half stunt , half science-and here is where the other half gets its due . There is a mystery here and the root of it lies in a contrary mysticism of celestial dynamics . Here , a mere sixty million kilometers from its fiery photosphere , are surfaces that have not seen the Sun since the Caloris impact defined Mercury 's final orientation . This same counterintuitive magic then decrees that the ices of comets that orbit impossibly far-beyond even Pluto , Charon , and Persephone-are actually closer to the Sun , and Mercury , in the energy of their motion than anything in the inner Solar System . Something on Venus would have to be kicked at almost 11 km/s to reach Mercury , best case-but merely nudge a pair of Oort belt comets together and parts of them may fall into Mercury , decades hence . Sometimes these colli sions give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condenses in the deep freeze of Chao Meng Fu . Blame this on Kepler and Newton , not Ptolemy . So near is far , and far is near , and the crevasse yawns from " ere to " ere . Does it have teeth ? Do its open jaws reveal molecules from the beginning of time , such as measured in the Solar System ? Lotati confers with his daughter , and Ed . Randi and Ed have a thing , I 've found , and spend a fair amount of time touching helmets . What great ideas I have ! I despair of ever being able to itch again , let alone going to Miranda with its namesake . My rented vacuum gear fits like the skin of a hundred-year-old man ; stretched taut digging into my flesh here , loose and bulging there . Randi says there 's an art to it and I should take more time getting in . Next time I will . I edge closer to the brink , attracted to the danger perhaps , or perhaps wanting to demonstrate courage to Randi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen from the sheer ice walls , and the layered structure is clear . There are Mercury 's sediments . Each comet or meteor creates a temporary atmosphere for Mercury , and that which is not boiled away by the Sun condenses in the polar craters , mixed with ejecta dust . The bedrock lies perhaps a kilometer below us . After three days of the most physical labor I 've done in decades , I now contemplate a rappel down to the bottom of a bottomless crevasse and the climb back up again . I look away as though by not observing it , I can create the possibility that it does not exist . But I have my journalist 's duty . At my command , my helmet camera plays back the view , and it floats , reflected off my face plate , against the stars . It does n't fit in the standard field of view , I realize , so I look over the edge again and slowly turn my head from horizon to horizon . An object of professional interest now , it begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescription for fear of something-study the hell out of it . How long and wide ! Then I turn off all my lights , let my eyes relax , and turn back to see the solar corona , a peacock 's tail of icy fire spreading from the Sun that sits just under those utterly black mountains that ring our horizon . If Chao Meng Fu did not flatten Mercury 's globe here , we would not be able to see those mountains this far into the trek , so close is Mercury 's horizon-but we have been heading ever so slightly inward , downhill , as well as south . The furthest streamers of the corona glow far above that rim behind , looking almost like the aurora borealis back on Earth . Awed , I step back , and back again to catch my balance . I happen to glance down-my boot is barely centimeters from the edge of the chasm . " Bubka , freeze . " Randi 's voice echoes in my helmet . I am already frozen . " Now . Raise right hand , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my right hand so I automatically start to raise my left " Your other right ! " she snaps , instantly . This time I get it right , raising both mu arm and the strobe lamp . " Now lean that way . Walk slowly . Away from edge . " I understand now : if I teeter , she wants me to teeter in the direction of safety . I walk away from the edge with as much dignity as I can muster , as if there were nothing at all wrong , knowing that anyone monitoring my heartbeat will know that I am anything but calm . She detaches herself from the management group and strides toward me , ghostly dust glittering in my helmet light behind her footsteps . She halts in a cloud of fairy sparkles , grabs my hand , and leads me well away from the edge of the crevasse . " Professor Bubka , near crevasses , tether . Always , always , tether . " " Professor " hangs in my mind dripping with irony . On Mars , I taught her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just come close to failing a test where failure is judged somewhat more harshly than at Jovis Tholis University . Nodding ruefully , I pull a piton gun from my pack and harpoon the planet . A test pull shows that it 's secure , and I clip the line to my belt . Randi fires a piton in too , clips on , then clips another line between her belt and mine . " Ed , some baby-sitter you 'd make ! Going to take a look . " " Sorry , mate . Watching , Randi . " Baby-sitter ? " Now , Professor Bubka . Let 's go look . " Dark eyes , on a tanned face with a snub nose , twinkle at me behind the clear , non-reflecting visor . We retrace my footprints together . We walk to the edge together . This time , I think to clip my strobe light to my belt as well . One of the things I see is half a footprint at the edge of the crevasse . The to half . Mine . What I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I am forgiven . She pulls on her line , then actually leans out over the cut , to inspect its near side . " Light . " The word is a request and a command . Crystals from far down glitter in response . Nervously , wrapping my line around my left hand and playing it out through a smart slot " belay device , centimeter by centimeter , I lean out with her and shine my strobe on the wall under us . On a dean vertical , the layering resembles a diffraction grating-fine thin grooves , perfectly horizontal , broken occasionally by what must be the sections of ancient buried craters . The strobe light looks continuous , but contains off-pulses for range-it times a journey of the absence of light . So . The crack goes down , a hundred meters , two hundred , three hundred . At five hundred , I can no longer see the light returning , but it can . I swing it slowly from side to side , as my helmet display paints a graph of angle and range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meters below us here , with some flatness between them . I move the beam a bit to the left . There is something across the chasm at eight hundred meters , just to our left . " Randi ? " " I see it . Bridge . Dad , channel seven . " " I have it , Randi ! I 'll think that is a billion years down if it 's a day ! What do you say , Juanita , my Randi 's found a bridge ! " There seemed no point in immediately explaining that I 'd found it . " Eight hundred meters down and all the way across ! Can we do it ? " Juanita answers , thrill in her voice . " Do we have enough line ? " " Yes and yes , " Randi 's father answers after a moment of thought . Then he points to a slight dip almost above the bridge . " Probably half of an old crater , broken by the crack . That will get us a few meters closer . We could rappel down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crevasse goes to the bottom of Chao Meng Fu . Do you want the bottom , Juanita ? " " God , yes , Emilio , if it is n't too dangerous . " Dr Lotati shrugs . " It has been this way for millions of years of impacts ; the walls should tolerate a few ants crawling on them . We 'll go ourselves , instead of waiting for some robots to do it . " I look across the chasm for the other half of the ancient crater , but , like the other half of my footprint , there is no sign of it . Where did it go ? I feel a curiosity as powerful as any hunger . What formed the bridge ? What lies at the bottom ? We shall find out , if the Laws of the Universe let us . We all have some climbing experience , but only the Lotatis and Ed have very much . It is , however , a very easy climb down in 38 percent gravity . The ropes are well secured to the plain above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Karen Svenson will remain on the rim with the bulk of the equipment until we are all safely down . They call themselves the " human robots " and have been in excellent humor . When Randi and Dr. Lotati scale the other wall , they will fire a rope across . The Lotatis will then pull over a larger rope on which a tram will carry the equipment . Meanwhile , at the bottom , Dr. Tierzo will supervise sample gathering by the rest of us . That is the plan . It becomes dark quickly as we descend . The sky contracts to a starry band overhead , one edge of which glows a faint , frozen , shadowy pearl , a reflection lit by a reflection of sunlight on distant peaks . We turn on our helmet lights , and their glare banishes any other source of illumination . They spread sparkly pools of light on the wall-tiny crystals everywhere . I am conscious of a fine mist or fog , just on the edge of the perceivable . Our suits allow the skin 's waste gases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds on which it may condense , our helmet lights evaporate hydrogen gas that has condensed on the wall . Our progress appears tinged with the ethereal . We are three hundred meters down : a football field on end . The descent is easy , simple , routine . You ease rope out under friction , take a pair of steps down , and ease out some more . This descent is demanding and terrifying . You dare not lose concentration . Pitons can pull out , crampons can slip , and you will be just as dead from a fall of a kilometer in Mercury 's gravity as Earth 's . Yes , it will take a few seconds longer and an academic might note that you hit with less velocity-only about five times instead of fifteen times what is needed to smash your helmet and the skull within it . You dare not cause problems for everyone else . One foot after another . A person in fear of his or her life needs no more excitement-but if you want it , you glance at the wall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when dinosaurs were young . This is not on a screen , not a simulation , but never-seen-before reality that puts ice hard in front of your own eyes . " Ed , " I ask , " do you wonder if anyone might have been here a billion years ago ? " " Eh ? Interesting thought , that . The feature would attract someone with enough curiosity to build spaceships , I should think . But the crack itself would n't be that old , now , would it ? " " No , I guess not . " When the layers were laid down , of course , this had been a part of the pain . Still , my eyes scan every layer , hoping . " Has everyone got positive pressure in their suits ? " Dr. Lotati asks , and receives chuckles . " There is , " he continues , " a significant build-up of nitrogen gas , and a bare trace of nitrogen triflouride , which I would not recommend breathing . " I call up a temp display and find that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred twenty at the surface . As I think about it , I notice traces of frost on the outside of my gloves : our insulation is that good . I have no idea what the biological implications of nitrogen trifluoride are , but I would rather someone else perform the experiments . A drop rolls down my face plate . " Watch your footing , Juanita , " Dr. Lotati says . " It 's slippery here . " So far , my crampons dig into the dirty clathrate walls with ease , but I can tell it is wet . The wall is mostly ice , but ice that is heavily mixed with crater ejecta , pocked with more volatile ices , and stiffened far harder than anything on Earth by cryogenic temperatures . Dr. Lotati says it 's something like sandstone , but if it were n't for the gas in the ice , it would be like concrete . There are few cracks , but the piton gun works well , as does the ax . " Nitrogen trifluoride data , " I ask . Floating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are glowing numbers telling me that nitrogen trifluoride is liquid over a range of about 80 kelvins-from about 77 up to 145-which is over 120 Celsius degrees below the freezing point of water . Somehow , stating such temperatures in kelvins above absolute zero is less scary than using negative Celsius degrees below freezing . The vapor pressure of this big , heavy molecule is almost nil at the low end of this temperature range-a wet vacuum . A hundred meters to go , and I can see the bridge clearly in the shifting pools of our helmet lights . " A sliver of wall appears to have detached itself and slid down until it jammed , " Dc Tierzo tells us . " The top is a jumble with , here and there , flat spaces that may have been part of the original surface , including part of a crater . I wonder if that 's what knocked it down ? " " Hello down there , " Karen Svenson calls . " Yes , that crater would explain what looks like a ray network around where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at , this spiderweb network of cracks is a real giveaway . " I had n't remembered any cracks . I ask my suit to play back my recording of our appraoch to the side . The surface in the depression was smooth . My pulse races . " Playback two hours ago , " I command . In a ghostly video window , my suit shows me almost falling in to the crevasse , but ... " Hey , everyone ! " I shout . " Those cracks were n't there before . Dr. Lotati , I 've got it on channel six . " Thee is a moment of silence . " Quickly now , " Dr. Lotati speaks briefly and very businesslike . " Those of you still on the wall come down as quickly as possible without panic and without yanking on anything . Mike and Karen , set another belay well back of the cracked area . " I have my full attention on climbing down , gingerly as possible . Dr. Tierzo is off belay just below me . I remember to lock my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lotati has set an ice bolt in at the far end of our bridge . Dr. Tierzo sets another one in the biggest hunk of bridge she can find at our end and pulls the line tight . Then I am off the wall . I quickly clip my line to the bridge line and release myself from the wall ropes . " Off belay . " Miranda Lotati and the grad student , Eloni , are still on the wall . I hear , I think , at very low frequency , a kind of groan . " We have the protection in , " Karen says . " The cracks are larger ! " " Wojciech can get your line , Ed , " Dr. Lotati says , " release from the wall immediately ! " " No worry . Here . " He tosses me the end of his spare line and I hit it with the loop of a smart " biner , which opens , takes the line , and shuts faster than I can see-like that old magic trick with hoops . I take up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding the taut line for balance until he reaches me . We move further down the bridge . " Come on Eloni , " Ed says encouragingly . The young Kenyan woman is the least experienced of our groupshe descends slowly , but flawlessly , a few meters right of where Ed came down . " Toss me the end of your spare line . " She stops to find it . Miranda Lotati 's feet are but a few meters above her . I hear another groan . " Come on . . . " Ed says again . Finally , Eloni tosses a coiled line toward Ed . It jerks short and dangles below her , a hopeless tangle . " Sorry , I try to do this too fast . " " That 's OK , mate , " Ed says . " Just come on down now . We 'll improvise . " We feel a slight tremor . She freezes . " Down , Eloni . Fast , " Randi says . Eloni starts moving again . I can see her tremble . " Ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnifying whispers and buffering shouts-that shout was well buffered . Eloni freezes . " Go , " Randi snaps , and clips Eloni 's helmet with the side of her boot , " Get going ! " Galvanized , Eloni half scrambles and half falls the remaining fifty meters , landing on her seat where the bridge butts against the wall . She starts fumbling with the " biner holding her line to the wall belay line . Ed , clipped to a line , moves to help herI think he has a knife in his hand . Heedless , I follow him using crampons and ax . Ed reaches Eloni . I look up and see the sky falling , Randi releases and leaps from almost twenty meters up on the wall , un-belayed , right at me . " Catch , " she shouts . I have time to set my crampon spikes and open my arms . She hits hard , and various pieces of her gear dig into my chest . I grab her as the boots tear free and we skitter together down the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slide . Ten meters from us , with a roar clearly conducted through the ice we lie against , an avalanche of*clathrate pours down . There is no sign of Ed and Eloni . Randi clips a line to my belt , rolls off , and starts to scramble back to the top of the bridge , ice dust streaming around her . " Ed ! " she shouts . " Eloni ! " The fall increases , becoming a white wall . Randi scrambles into it . I follow and am enveloped in a stream of pulverized clathrate , and I can see nothing . It flows over me , not like sand or water , but something in between-not dense , but still exerting pressure . I wait : My helmet is filled with the sound of my breathing . " Ed ! " Randi shouts again . " We 're alive . " Ed 's voice is hoarse and strained . " Trapped next to the wall . The fall created a bit of a pocket . No injuries , but it 's getting somewhat cold . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in no danger of suffocating . But under our coveralls we wear skintight vacuum suits that depend on a surrounding vacuum for much of their thermal control and the fabric of the vacuum suits , while smart and extremely tough , is necessarily thin . Conduction of heat could quickly freeze Ed and Eloni . But , clinging to the side of the bridge with the landslide still in progress , there is nothing I can do to reach them . " Got you on locator . Can move . " That is Randi Lotati , for me . Move ? How ? I roll over prone to the face of the bridge , reach forward into the flow with my hands , and find purchase . With both arms and legs , I find I can edge forward , too . " Solid piece-here . " Randi says . " Ice boulder . Think you 're on other side . " " S-sounds that w-way , " Ed replies . " Line charge . My side . Push like hell when I say . " " No , Randi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Push , damn it ! Now ! " I hear the crack of the detonation . " Randi ? " I call , and claw my way toward the signals , white sand and occasional rocks still streaming by me . Somehow , though , it seems a bit easier . " Randi , Ed ? " " Wojciech , Ed . We-we 're free . At-at least the rock 's split . Need help with Eloni . " " I 'm trying . " I pant . " Where 's Randi ? " I am exhausted struggling against the continuing stream of material from above . I reach forward with my hand and hit flesh . Someone there . The world is gray in my helmet lamp ; I can see nothing . " Ed , is that you ? " " Not me , mate . It 's slackening a little . I 've got some space . " The someone moans . The groan is female . " Eloni ? " I push the person in front of me again , harder " She 's with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She grunts . " Wojciech . I 'm OK . I 'm just . . stuck . Legs wo n't move . " I feel a hand brush mine , then lock with mine . " Drag me back . " " I 'll try . " Trusting the precarious hand link , I sit up into the flow of clathrate mud . It tries to take me away with tremendous force , but my line holds me . Slowly I get my legs around in front of me and pull as hard as I dare . She does n't move . " It 's no good . I 'll hurt you if I pull any harder . " " Freezing 's worse . Hurt me . Pull . " God knows how much force I put on her arm , but something seems to unstick , and she comes toward me , slowly at first ; then something breaks free and we scoot back about four meters . I can see through whirls of snow here . I can see my clip still on the bridge line , see Randi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Lotati , she 's out . Over here . " " What ? Wojciech ? Where ? . . . There , I have you ! I 'll be right over . " He is there in a moment . " Had you on the other side of the Bridge for a moment-propagation freak , I think . Randi , will you be all right for a few minutes ? " " Hurts like hell , Dad , but yes . Thanks , Wojciech . " Dr. Lotati gives her a pat and plunges into the remains of the ice fall . Minutes later , he and Ed emerge , carrying Eloni between them . " Mike , Karen , this is Emilio , " he says . " We 're all out of the avalanche . I do n't know in what shape yet , but we 're all out . " " Roger . We suggest all of you rest a bit until this plays itself out . " " Mike . . . " He pauses , catching his breath . " We 'll consider that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next five minutes or so , watching the river of white dust slowly come to a halt . Finally the ice fall abates entirely and we take stock . Randi reports a severe sprain in her right shoulder . Ed is recovering from hypothermia and is severely bruised as well . Eloni is better , physically , but appears to be in some kind of psychological shock . The rest of us have minor bruises . The side of the crevasse looks like a giant took a huge , semicircular bite out of it . Karen and Mark wave at us from an edge that is now at least fifty meters back from where it was . We lost two long lines , buried in the debris . The avalanche has buried half the bridge and I worry that it could start again at any time and bury us along with the other half . I try to do some mental calculations on how long it would take a suborbital hopper to get here and pull us out . " I think we are here for a while , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all up to climbing out again . We might overnight on the bridge . " If he 's worried about the avalanche restarting , he is n't saying so . " We 'll need to revise the schedule a bit , " Ed adds . " Another five kilometers per day would do it , I should think . Now , how do we get the gear down here ? " " Toboggan the big tent down to us , " Randi says . " Meantime , collect data . " I stare at Randi , stupefied . " Are you OK , Etoni ? " I ask , mainly out of concern but perhaps with a secondary agenda of reminding people of something . Eloni raises her head and looks around in wonder . If she expects a chewing out , it seems she is in the wrong group . I lay a hand very gently on her shoulder , and , as if I touched some kind of hidden button , she leans into me and lets out a very long sigh , which I hear clearly where my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in the glare of our headlights , her face is unreadable . Warning bells ring in my head . " My mistake , Eloni , " Ed says , " pressuring you like that for something that 's not automatic . You needed to think it through , and with me talking at you like that , you could n't . My mistake . " " Eloni , " Dr. Lotati asks , " Can you help Juanita get her samples tomorrow ? " Eloni takes a breath and slips away from me. al-I can do that . " A smile of relief creases the young woman 's features . " That away ! " " Randi ? " I ask , dumbfounded . " Your arm ? " " I 'll live . Still go for the bottom , Juanita ? " " There may be a pond of liquid nitrogen trifluoride down there  --  it 's unprecedented . " " Ed ? " He looks down , then at the crevasse sides . " Why do n't I help Randi with the camp and prepare for climbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereunder the sword of Damocles . " Wojciech ? " Dr. Lotati asks . I am at a loss for words . I am more tired and sore than I have ever been . How much more tired and sore can I be before I am a danger , I wonder ? Everyone has been pummeled and challenged . But these people , these comrades of mine , will not admit disaster . They will press on . It is a collective decision-a spontaneous informal vote of voices that is already a majority . Voicing misgivings on my part would do no good at all , and my fate is tied to theirs . But I wonder that such things can still be in this age of robots . May the ghosts of Byrd , Amundsen , Lewis and Clark , and Bering fill my mind with whatever it is that gets one through . I came here to prove myself worthy and now the question is upon me . I look at the crevasse sides and down into its deep . " Three climbers would be best . " Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go with a little rest . " Dr. Lotati nods . " We can all use some . It 's only 1100 . We 'll set up on the bridge . Mike and Karen , we 'll take the big tent-you can probably slide it down on ropes . " This only takes a few minutes . We anchor the large vacuum tent to the bridge . It fits with about a meter to spare in width-with the door toward the intact wall . Room in the tent is limited . It was meant to sleep four and it is crowded with six of us . Our body odors again mingle in a forgettable stew of smells , and the drop curtain for its tiny commode is woefully inadequate for privacy . But we are relieved and happy-we have been through a memorable adventure and nobody has gotten killed . Ed is quiet , eats quickly , and is asleep in his sack , fully clothed , in minutes . He says nothing . We will take a very real risk shortly , far , far , from help-for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month from now . As a certified-and some might say certifiable-poet , suicidal undertakings are perhaps in my nature . But the milieu of the Gentleman Adventurer requires that one return from the adventure to recount it . While Ed was gallant in the crisis , the closeness of his brush with death might only now be sinking into him . I , with far less experience , accepted a challenge he did not-does he resent this ? No , I tell myself , he is just exhausted . I have to make myself eat-I 'm hungry , but more tired . A warm sleepsack never felt so good , I realize . It seems I have barely closed my eyes when Dr. Lotati is gently rocking me awake . " It 's 1400 , " he says . " Time to go . " The trip to the bottom of the crevasse is a straightforward rappel . With Randi resting her arm , Eloni and I head for the bottom with Juanita in the lead . " This could be Calorian clathrateproof that Chao Meng Fu is older . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young ? " I ask . Old surfaces are heavily cratered . " Watch for a hollow to your left . No , the surface is young due to deposition-the crater itself is ancient . I 'd guess we 're about 3.8 billion years down , below the original crater floor . The walls are shock-fractured rock , not exposed sediment layers . No strata- " a swing of her ax tears a rough section of about a square meter from the wall " - underneath . " " Look , more signs of erosion , " she adds later . " Erosion ? " The wall is a rough breccia , a compressed clathrate and gravel mixture . The larger stones are sharp , not rounded . " There is evidence of atmosphere all around us-you can see icicles in the hollows , and a cold glistening wetness on the walls . " I turn off my radio . " Can you hear me ? " I shout . There is no answer-the vapor is still too thin , even at the bottom , to conduct sound . We hang from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nitrogen trifluoride in the circles of our helmet lamps below us . Unable to resist the temptation , I reach into one of Mercury 's nostrils and break off an icicle and toss it into the pool . It ripples like oily water . " Wojciech , " Eloni says in a mildly scolding voice , " have some respect ! That pool has been built up , molecule by molecule , probably over billions of years . " " How ? " Juanita asks , gently . " Even if the crater is that old , the crevasse is n't . " Eloni is silent , then says . " Oh , of course . But where does it come from then ? " " The pool is a mystery , for now , " Juanita says . " Perhaps some comet with an unusual concentration of fluorine ices struck not too long ago . Or something else . " She laughs . " Fortunately , not all mysteries can be solved now . We would run out of things to do ! " I envision tentacles reaching out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Could something have evolved to base its blood on that , the way we use seawater ? " " Not my field , " Juanita answers . " But let 's take a sample . " She is closest , and deftly dips a sample capsule into the liquid . Nothing emerges to bite her hand off-so much for that fantasy . I might not have had the nerve . Then I have a moment of insight ; to do this requires the right balance of imagination and nerve . " I do not think , " Eloni offers , " that there would be enough energy for life . If there were , the liquid would boil away . Hydrocarbons at these temperatures would be frozen solid , so what could one use to build life molecules ? How could anything that would work at these temperatures get here without being destroyed by the Sun first ? Still , it is an interesting thought , Wojciech . " " If the crack could go down a hundred kilometers or so , " Juanita remarks , " it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk around with the right atmosphere . But Mercury would close a crack that deep ; its crust is surprisingly thin , even now . This is not Mars . " She sounds like my fifth-year teacher back in Krakow . I suddenly feel far , far over my head . These people understand where they are and what they are doing : it holds no terror for them , no fear of sticking a hand where it might not come back . But for me , my overripe literary imagination haunts my mind like the tale of the bogeyman that kept me out of grandfather 's basement until I was seven . I am not comfortable here-but , I tell myself , I will enjoy having been here more when , and if-always if-we get back . " It 's time to go back , " Juanita says , her vials filled . " Climbing . " " Climbing , " we all say . " Belay on , " Dr. Lotati says , from far above us . The climb back up to the bridge is slow . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-meter cores , drilled slantwise , at those layers which Juanita estimates to have been laid down during the great events of the inner Solar System : layers that may contain glass beads from the Imbrium impact on Luna , Caloris here , Hellas on Mars , and , just possibly , a few grains with the right isotope ratios to be from the K-T impact on Earth . If we find these , we can bring the geological history of the planets together . If , the paradigm goes , we understand better why the Solar System is the way it is , we will understand better why we are the way we are-the forces that have shaped our evolution and those of other sentient races . But we wo n't know if the samples contain what we suspect for many months , by which time we will have scattered to the nether ends of the Solar System . We are tired and bruises remind us of yesterday 's avalanche with each bump , but there is a sense of elation about us . We are the first people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its natural state . And no machine saw it first . When we arrive back at the ice bridge , Juanita sees me staring nervously at the slide . " I 've calculated the slope and the coefficient of friction , Wojciech-I think it 's fully relaxed . It may stay that way for a billion years . " " Now you tell me ! " But would the trip have been as thrilling if she had ? " What caused it to go in the first place ? " " Our weight , I think , plus an accumulation of stresses . I 'm beginning to think the crevasse is fairly young-otherwise a meteor impact would have caused the slump before we did . " " There could be more than physical tension , " Eloni says . " Near the surface , over many years , radiation will cause chemical changes and produce unstable molecules in crystalline ice . A physical shock , such as an ax , might release these energies . " " Possibly , " Juanita says . I look down at the ice bridge under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be even more recent-and not , I hope , have had time to accumulate radiation " energies . " We are physically tired but the midday nap and the feeling of accomplishment leave us too hyper to sleep immediately . After rations , I suggest the idea that had led me to join their expedition in the first place . " Randi ? " I ask . " Dr. Lotati ? " They turn their heads to me . " Are you aware of the theories of a Dr. Nikhil Ray ? " Dr. Lotati purses his lips as if he had something to say , then thought better of it . Juanita answers . " He tries to explain the low density of Miranda and some other outer satellites , by making them a sponge of caverns . It is an innovative idea , but , I 'm afraid , not well accepted . " Dr. Lotati grunts . " I 've met the man . His theories are unorthodox and he has this infuriatingly superior manner about him .... Well , we 'll know soon enough anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the major Uranian satellites . " As " free " robot-produced resources grew exponentially , so did the Interplanetary Association 's influence on who goes where and does what . The IPA , whose main members are the United Nations of Earth , the Mars Council , and the Cislunar Republic , responds , in large measure , to politicians . They in turn respond to the media and the public-I am counting on this . " I was , " I venture , " thinking that it might be time to visit Miranda-and that , with the coincidence in their names , Randi might be the one to do it . It would certainly be an interesting angle . Especially if Dr. Ray could be persuaded to come . " Dr. Lotati frowns . " That would be rather commercial , would n't it ? " Ed contributes with a wink in my direction . He is not taking this too seriously . " Finish school , " Randi says , " do some low g work in the asteroids , Saturn , then maybe . " She grins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There are certainly caves there , " Juanita says with a grin , " but if they are big ones , you might be sorry about taking Nikhil . He 's already insufferable with the issue in doubt . God help us if he 's right ! " Dr. Lotati and Ed laugh heartily . Randi shrugs , and a flicker of pain crosses her face at the gesture . The shoulder hurts more than she wants us to know , I suspect . " You can make too much of that , " Ed says . " He 's not a monster , Juanita . He can be very much the gentleman , and his conversation is always interesting . I sometimes wonder if the personality conflicts do n't have more to do with his peer review problems than the merits of his work . " Dr. Lotati turns and tugs on his beard . " Uranus is the frontier , " he finally says . " There 's only one small inhabited scientific station in the Uranus system , in its outer satellite , Mustardseed . Within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stares briefly at me , then Randi . " Also , I do n't want to associate the Society with Ray 's claims just yet . Let 's see what happens with the seismic study . And let 's see how well Wojciech 's presentation of this expedition is received . " I glance at Randi . She stares back at me , intently , and the ghost of a smile crosses her face as she wrinkles her nose . " I could use a shower , " I say , - humorously . There will be no showers for several days yet . But Randi hands me a silver foil wrapper . Her nose has decided that it 's bath time-understandable in view of our exertions . The foil contains a light towelette soaked in a cleaning solution that does not have to be rinsed . She offers them to the others , removes her coveralls , and then releases the seam of her vacuum suit . Her father turns his back to us and , facing the wall of the tent , does the same . Eloni also turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they exchange a brief smile . We are a cross section of the Solar System , and a cross section of attitudes about our bodies . I still feel a slight twinge , as if in nostalgia for an old cultural taboo , but the observer of people in me rejoices the passing of taboos . Ed , surprisingly , seems the one uncomfortable with communal bathing . Juanita , whose family left Earth a century ago , is already sponging , oblivious to anything else . She is a well-endowed woman in excellent condition , as is everyone on this kind of endeavor . Her hair , unbound , hangs to her shoulders . It is almost all white and makes her skin look darker than it is in contrast . Her only other concessions to her fifty standard years are a slight gut and a bit of looseness on her neck and under her arms . Randi is still watching Ed watch her , as if she enjoys it . She is a rangy young woman of jet-black hair and well defined , though not exaggerated muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god who in making an athlete decided at the last minute to make a woman , too . There is an intriguing hardness about the rest of her , including an untouched scar on her side . But her face , her smile , and her manner are womanly . Embarrassed at myself for staring , I turn around like Dr. Lotati and finish undressing-applying the cleaning cloth to my body . But I love women too much to resist another look . When I do , both Eloni and Juanita are looking at me . Our eyes meet , we smile and I relax . My feelings as they watch me bathe are hard to describe-would it make sense to say that I felt first forgiven ? I feel something of a sense of camaraderie . Then Eloni reaches with both hands and turns me to the side of the tent . Its drum-tight bulge instantly reminds me of the vacuum , just beyond that millimeter of tough , impervious fabric . I feel a damp cloth on my back , up and down , hitting every needful spot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sighs just on the edge of audibility . Almost like a purr . I feel suddenly very good , and useful-should poetry and nature writing fail me completely , I could do this for a living . Well , maybe . Dr. Lotati turns to crawl into his sleeping bag , and I accidentally get a brief glimpse of injuries he has chosen not to show the rest of us . Gunshot wounds ? Before he can seal the side , Juanita touches his shoulder and crawls in with him . Boni turns from the wall then and sees Randi and me , not yet in our sleeping bags . She looks down , then looks up again , then crawls into her sleeping bag . I ca n't read the expression on her face . I get into my bag , pull my suit and helmet in with me , and seal the hood behind me . Its flaps will close and hold pressure if there is an accident while I sleep . " Lights off , " Randi says , and the tent complies . It is utterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes adapt , I glance in her direction , but her sleeping bag is empty . She is probably not sleeping with Eloni , which leaves Ed . I feel a twinge of jealousy , though I know Ed has known the Lotatis for many years , and gone on several expeditions with them . The exhaustion of this day does not permit sexual regrets , however . It seems like only a moment , and then I awake to light , discussions about the ascent , and the smell of freshly opened breakfast bars . The discussion is between Ed and Emilio , and it concerns who is to go up the wall with Randi , to set the ropes for the rest of us . " We need to make time , " Dr. Lotati says . " All the more reason for you to go with Randi . You 're a team . " " Thank you , friend , but I am sixtytwo years old and you are thirty-eight . You and Randi climb well together . " There is a slight hint of humor in Emilio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows they do more than climb well together . " It 's only a kilometer , mate . You 're as good as ever . " " I 'll second that , " Juanita says . Dr. Lotati smiles and shakes his head . " The group comes first . " Randi embraces her father , wordlessly , but I can see her eyes glisten . Then Dr. Lotati reaches over to Ed and they grasp hands . Something has passed , I realize , and who am I to witness such a passing ? More than ever , I feel an ambitious interloper . I look over at Eloni . She is looking at me . Wistfully ? I smile back . We pack quickly and efficiently , filling the soft pressure packs first with the things that can stand vacuum , then the hard ones . When the tent is bare , the last pack is sealed and we take it down to a tenth of an atmosphere . We check each other 's seals and fit . Randi frowns at mine , and has me depressurize to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think , my blood would boil . We normally breathe a fifty-fifty oxygen-nitrogen mix at four-tenths atmosphere , so I still have a quarter of Earth normal oxygen partial pressure . I try not to get excited . Randi treats this like an everyday event . She tugs , pulls , and smooths all my joint areas . She is utterly clinical about this , but happens to glance up with a wink when she adjusts my leg seams . " Its all in the family , " her look seems to say . I find myself slipping as if to an event horizon . Do I want to befriend this woman to pursue fame and fortune on her distant namesake moon , or has my idea for an expedition to the moon become an excuse to be near the woman ? I suddenly realize that I am very , very taken by her . She reseals my suit and I tell it to bring its pressure up again . She has indeed worked wonders , and I am much more comfortable than I was the day before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeezes my arm , then turns to the business at hand . The tent finishes taking itself down to near vacuum . When the sides are noticeably softer , we open the main seal , and the tent ripples as the remaining millibar or so of air escapes . We turn our helmet lights on and emerge into the crevasse again . The wall is suddenly lit with floodlights-Mike and Karen have seen us emerge . It is one kilometer of graybanded dirty clathrate , vertical , except for the parts that are more than vertical . Randi leads ; if she falls , she is less weight on the bolts and pitons that hold our ropes . " This stuff is like soft sandstone , " Ed says . " I can almost push a piton in by hand , here and there . " " Use more . " Randi says . " Angle down . " " OK . " He is silent for a while . " There . I suggest we do this before I lose my nerve . Belay on . " " Climbing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking turns . I happen to be looking up when it happens . Randi is climbing when her foothold crumbles . She grabs for a line , says " Damn ! " then , " Falling . " Her effort to grab has pushed her out from the wall , and when the rope goes taut , one of the pitons pops out of the wall with a shower of dust and ice . After a brief hesitation , the other two follow , and Ed yells , " Slack ! " Desperately , Randi tries to slow her fall by digging her hands and crampons into the wall beside her , throwing up a wake of dust . The smoothness of the wall helps ; it is not completely vertical , and there are no bumps to throw her out . The next set of pitons catches her rope , and for half a second it looks like it might hold . But before she comes to a complete halt , they pull out too and she starts to slide down again . Now , only Ed 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hundred-meter fall . He is furiously trying to hammer in more pitons , but there is little rope left between him and Randi . They need another secure line . Why , with six other more experienced explorers present , I am the one to think of something is a mystery . Perhaps it hassomething to do with creativity , or with not having a mind full of the knowledge of things that would n't work . " Mike , Wojciech . Can you fire a rocket line right into the wall above them ? It ought to penetrate that stuff and anchor itself . " He does n't take time to answer me . There is a flash from overhead and an impact ten meters above Ed . The line it carries is much thinner than climbing rope , but drapes down beside them quickly in the vacuum . It continues to play out , draping all the way down to our little camp . The line between Randi and Ed snaps tight , and his foot and arm come free in a shower of ice . He should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than two , but he tries to hold on to the wall . He does n't dare let go and reach for the new , untested line , hanging less than a meter away . It almost works . Randi , caught short , manages to reach her ax and digs into the wall like a desperate fly . Working with her right hand , she sets one piton and then another , hammering them in with her fist . Above her , the rest of the ice holding Ed begins to give way as he tries to regain his handhold . " Ca n't hold , falling ! " He flails for the new line as he starts to slip , but it is out of reach . They , would , I think , be dead on Earth-but Mercury gravity is more forgiving . Working as Ed slides , Randi reaches the new line and yanks hard on it . She yanks hard again-it must not have been firmly set . Another hard pull and she seems satisfied . Ed slides down beside her in a plume of dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quickly Randi connects the new line to the line that still connects them , slack now , and loops it around the piton she has just set . " Protection in ! " Thirty meters below her , Ed bounces as the line pulls taut and pops the piton out of the wall in another shower of debris . Ed 's weight pulls Randi free of her holds as well . They both slide another ten meters , but now the slack in the line from the rocket has been taken up . They slide some more as it stretches , then , finally , stop . All told , Randi has fallen about a hundred meters and Ed perhaps fifty . " Jupiter ! " Karen , on the crevasse rim , exclaims . " Randi , Ed , set yourselves if you can . I can see the rocket : it 's wedged itself vertically in the hole it made when it hit the wall , only about ten centimeters from the face . Try to hold tight while we think of something . " " OK , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think I 'm about at the end of my rope about this . " The laughter , fueled by relief , is perhaps a little too loud for the quality of the pun . Ed quickly starts hammering in additional protection . Randi , however , is simply hanging passively in her harness . " Randi ? " Mike calls . " Injured . Both arms . " Her voice attempts calm , but I can hear the pain in it . " Can you climb ? " Mike asks . Randi tries to lift an arm up to her rope and gasps . " Not now . " " Descending , " Ed says . " I 'd like another belay if you can think of something . " What we think of is setting our remaining line rocket for maximum range and steering it about six meters under the far edge of the crevasse . It slams in hard , burying itself too far in for Karen to see . " Ice , " Mike says , instantly , as a patch of icy regolith loosened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The upper layers , as we know , are softer . They pull the line from the far edge until it sets hard-ten kilonewtons tension , Mike estimates . Then they let the line drape down to us , and we walk it over to where Ed can reach it . He connects the lines , and continues down . Randi tries to descend . We hear the slightest hint of a cry of pain over the radio , then a loud " Damn ! Dad , I ca n't lift my hands over my shoulders . Both shoulders shot . " " That 's all right , Randi , I 'm coming . " Dr. Lotati turns and looks at me . " Come on , Wojciech . I want your head on that wall . " Juanita gives me a pat on the rear , and surprisingly , Eloni gives me a silent hug . Inside her visor , her dark eyes are glistening . I think of how frightened the Kenyan student must be , but she has just contributed in the only way she could think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and squeeze her hand . I clip my ascent ratchet on and start climbing . There are no problems and we reach Randi and Ed in half an hour . Randi is calm . " Right arm . Wo n't go above shoulder . Maybe dislocated . Left arm works , sort of . But hurts too much . Might faint . OK as long as I keep my hands down . " " I 'll take you down , papoose-style , " Ed offers . " Then we 'll ride the elevator up . " Dr. Lotati touches Randi . " OK ? " " I 'll make it , Dad . " " Good , Wojciech and I will go up then , and set the anchor , " Dr. Lotati decides . His voice crackles with leadership and confidence . I smile . Everyone , including him , has forgotten about his age . It wo n't be obvious on this climb ; if anything , I will slow him down . We replace Ed 's backpack with Randi , tying her to his shoulder harness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Lotati nods to me , and says " We have to consider everything we put into this surface to be hazardous , no ? " I nod . We are leaning out from a wall almost half a kilometer above a bridge about half a kilometer above a pool of cryogenic nitrogen trifluoride , talking about how the various things that hold our ropes to said wall may give way at any time . " OK . We use four pitons , or bolts , or a combination , on each belay , and arrange the ropes like so . " He demonstrates , creating what looks at first glance to be a cat 's cradle of ropes between carabiners and pitons . " This equalizes forces among the pitons and minimizes the shock if one lets go . " It takes me a couple of tries to get it right . He finally pats me on the shoulder , and without further ado says " climbing . " " On belay , " I answer , wondering about people who seem to come alive only when staring death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast . Actually , I keep up , but exhaust myself in the process . Dr. Lotati is only a centimeter or two taller than his daughter , and hardly much heavier . He is wiry strong ; occasional rest stops are the only concession he makes to age-and I need them more than he does . We stop where the second line-bearing rocket buried itself in the fragile clathrate , six meters below the crater floor . The ledge is overhung by about a meter , more where the rocket impact dislodged a large hunk of wall . " Can you stand a short fall ? " he asks me. al think we 'll need several tries to get around that edge . " I 've never fallen on a belay line before . I want to impress Emilio ; my Mirandas , moon and woman , are at stake . But the idea of trying to scramble almost upside down and free-falling six to ten meters , with only a questionable anchor to stop me if I slip , scares the crap out me . If there were any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . " Then , perhaps because my mind works best in an emergency , or under a deadline , the idea comes to me . " Dr Lotati-this is fairly soft stuff . You do n't suppose we could just tunnel through it , up to the surface ? " He looks down at me . " Perhaps ! I would n't consider desecrating an Earth climb like that , but I think we will be forgiven here . I knew your head would be good for something ! " Then he takes an ax from his belt and swings it into the ice overhead . A good sized hunk falls and shatters into tiny chips on my helmet . " Ice ! " He looks at his handiwork , says , " Si , " and swings again , and again , cutting a notch more than a tunnel as it turns out . We are through and up to the crater floor in less than an hour . There is a round of cheers when we say , " On top ! " Mike and Karen wave from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has taken us two days to go that hundred meters . I help set the next set of anchors a hundred meters back from the edge , in firm regolith . The rest is ropes , ascenders and pulleys . Mike and Karen send the remaining gear , . and themselves , across in an ersatz tram , and help us hoist the rest of the party . Juanita is the last one to emerge from the crevasse and we all cheer , intoxicated with our close call and our final victory . By the time everything is up or over , we have been awake for thirty hours . Dr. Lotati decides to set up camp immediately . We have four two-person tents in addition to the large one . They can be independent or their entrances can be sealed to connecting ports in the large tent , forming a mini-base looking something like an inflated starfish minus an arm . That way , early risers can let others sleep . Randi 's left shoulder is bad-a possible separation-and we have at least three days " march ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evacuation , but she wo n't hear of it . Mike and Ed both have field medical training but Mike has more practice , so he is the closest thing to a doctor we have , and he consults with Earth . It turns out that our optical scattering imager is good enough to build up a picture of the injury ; Randi 's humerus is not quite in its socket . Earth recommends evacuation . Randi says no . Dr. Lotati supports her-we are in an age where injuries can be healed if they can be endured , but the opportunities to do something more significant than entertain oneself and collect one 's automation stipend are few and far between . Randi , Ed told me several nights ago , is Dr. Lotati 's only son . I laughed and asked Ed what that made him . " The gayest man on Mercury , " he answered-and threw such a convincing leer at me that it took me an unsettling second to get the joke . But the humor disguises a poignant situation-a young woman trying to be , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much was from her nature , how much was from her love ? Or was there a difference ? And what of her mother ? Randi 's mother was never mentioned by anyone , and the only public biographical info was that Emilio had divorced her when Randi was six and never married again . Following instructions from the doctors on Earth , Mike resets the shoulder . It takes him two tries . Randi shuts her eyes and gasps-that is all . Then it is in . Painkillers , anti-inflammatory drugs , and reconstructive stimulants we have-she will be sore , but as good as new in a few months . Climbing is out , but she can walk the rest of the way . Ed and Randi retire together , her arm immobilized to her body with tape . Juanita decides to sleep with Emilio . Mike and Karen are a given . Eloni is looking at me with dark pools of eyes and what could be a hopeful smile on her face . I look at the shy graduate student who had given me a hug to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the width of an idea of killing two people . I shrug and reach a hand out to her and she comes and sits by me with the widest grin on her face I have ever seen . " You wish I were Randi , do n't you ? " Eloni asks me . " That 's not your fault . " Her smile fades . " I almost got us all killed by being too slow . That was my fault . " There are times when sympathy can do things lust can not . I have my arms around her in a second . " No one blames you . You 're part of us , now . Time to enjoy it . " She kind of melts into me and gently pushes me down onto my back on my sleepsack . She has a low , incredibly sexy voice . " That is about as much as I can enjoy . I hope I do not disappoint you . " Tired as I am , I 'm relieved , and confused . " Eloni , I write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than experience , I 'm afraid . I may sigh , but disappointment would be putting things a bit strong . But I 'm curious . Do you believe in abstinence , and if so , can you tell me why ? " No contraception , I speculate ? In this day , I find that hard to believebut she is studying at Jovis Tholis on Mars , I remind myself , in the middle of the New Reformation . A certain hardness comes over her face . " You want to know ? I spoke literal truth . Abstinence has nothing to do with it . I was mutilated so I can not enjoy what most women can enjoy . So I hike across glaciers and climb mountains instead , " she smiles wryly . " That is how I get high . Try to understand . I am not Kenyan by birth . Kenya is a civilized nation . " I have it then . Female circumcision . Back on Earth , the villages all have nice premanufactured houses , with bathrooms , electricity , diagnostic comm ports , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise gentle people protect primitive cultures from " western interference , " and so we still permit this to be done to children . " How old were you ? " " Ten . They were very thorough . But in a few years , doctors will be able to fix it , I think . Regenerate the tissue that was taken from me . That 's a spin-off from the interstellar project . They needed to solve tissue regeneration to do cold sleep reliably . For now , I must enjoy giving and being enjoyed while I fantasize what it might really be like . " What can one say ? I take her hand and she squeezes it . " Oh , yes . " Her voice is low and throaty . " They mutilated me , they tried to keep me barefoot and stupid to carry on their primitive culture . They even tried to keep me from school . But they could not shut off my mind . And here I am , yes , here I am where they thought I could never go doing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am a space person now , part of another tribe . " Eloni and I are both , I realize , refugees from cultures that do not want who we are . Hers a primitive one , mine too sophisticated to see itself . I only want to hold her , smother her hurt , and bring a smile to her face . I try to kiss her . She holds me off . " Someday I have to go back there and try to change what the people do to each other there . I can not be a space person forever Do you understand ? " She buries her face in my shoulder . " For now . Just for now . " I understand . This is for now-and whatever our feelings for each other now , our destinies lie in different directions . I nod and she is in my arms . Our lips touch again and the future vanishes . " What do you do want me to do ? " I ask . In answer , she releases the seal of my tight suit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sleep sack . She wriggles against me and we do kiss , and our hands do stroke and caress , and begin to defy the cold dead gray cruelty outside our bubble with yet another act of life . But there really is n't very much room and we are both very tired . So , in each other 's arms , we fall asleep , content with a mostly symbolic defiance . The remaining walk toward the center of Chao Meng Fu is two by two , the time filled mostly with conversations that share what we are and what we know , but sometimes with those comfortable silences in which your mind digests what you have learned , playing this way and that with it . There are more crevasses to cross , but we do so expeditiously . During one of these crossings , I say , " On belay , Dr. Lotati . " " Climbing . Wojciech , call me Emilio , it 's quicker . " A small thing , but it suggests to me a future more interesting than correcting undergraduate papers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final approach to the central depot . It is by a twentieth-century composer named Alan Hovhaness , a symphony called " City of Light . " She says it is his symphony number twenty-two . " Twenty-two ? " I ask . " Did I hear you right ? I know Haydn wrote over a hundred , but that was when they were short and highly formatted . Beethoven wrote only nine . Tchaikovsky , six . I thought they 'd pretty much stopped doing symphonies by the twenty-first century . " Juanita laughed . " We geologists call Hovhaness our patron composer because he actually wrote a symphony about a volcano-and that was number fifty . By the mid-twenty-first century , they were calling him " the American Haydn . " Now let 's just listen . " As we approach the brilliant peaks of the Chao Meng Fu central crowngreat massive round Sun-gilded domes that speak of power and eternity-I am incapable of understanding why I once thought of this expedition as a stunt . I feel like a piece of steel , bent , hammered , bent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I have ever known before . It is a feeling I want to have again , if I must pursue it to the ends of the Solar System . Perhaps I am not in a class with Ed Blake and perhaps any fantasies I had of a match with Randi must remain fantasies , but I have found in my own backyard a delicate and precious union with Eloni and a friend and colleague in Juanita . And I think I have succeeded in my main objective-I have , I think , the friendship and respect of the people who could bring me out to the frontier which calls my spirit . As I walk I feel the voices of a more broad-shouldered century calling me ; Stanley , Peary , Scott , Teddy Roosevelt , and among poets , of course , Kipling . As I trudge , I amuse myself with a doggerel : Perhaps those prudent people Who never risk the pit , Also never know the joy Of coming out of it Not prize material , perhaps , but sums my experience , and in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And if my words fail you-as they fail many others of highly educated tastes-then listen to the finale of Hovhaness " symphony . For if you can not understand after hearing that you have left the human race . What I learned , in the crossing of Chao Meng Fu , was that such things still can be , in any age , for anyone who will do them .
