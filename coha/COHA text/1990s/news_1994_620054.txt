<p> DO N'T BLAME CRIME ON DECLINE OF FAMILY <p> Editor  --  Never underestimate the ignorance of the American people as evidenced in Chris Granero 's letter of September 9 blaming the beleaguered family for the barbaric behavior of young people today . <p> Families do n't exist in vacuums . She " forgets " that for 12 years in the neo-Dark Ages of the Reagan- Bush regime , cruelty through budget cuts and social service programs , education , the environment and the arts became national policy . These policies together with the invasions of Grenada and Panama , and the slaughter of civilian populations in Iran set a role model at the highest levels for this country . This model essentially said : Life is n't worth much . <p> This message is the legacy America now suffers with . The role of government is " to promote the general welfare , " not demote it , which has occurred . Let there be more value put on life and families through funds for education , social programs and the arts and this country would turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fathers when his administration killed every effort for subsidized child care and parental leave . In case you have n't noticed , Chris , America is a sad place . <p> MARIS ARNOLD <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> GOVERNMENT VS . FAMILY <p> Editor  --  In his September 12 letter , " Dan Quayle Preaches to the Choir , " Douglas Long wrote , " the lead Republican figure is pursuing an issue ( the strength of the American family ) which has almost nothing to do with government or public policy . " <p> Actually , government policy has weakened the family , and if reversed , could strengthen it . <p> To begin with , Supreme Court decisions against censorship have enabled the entertainment industry to popularize a system that is depreciatory of chaste monogamy . <p> Moreover , sex education courses in public schools that teach condom use rather than abstinence reinforce the message of Hollywood , television and rock music . <p> Finally , Aid to Families with Dependent Children subsidizes illegitimacy . <p> JOHN ENGELMAN <p> Walnut Creek <p> . <p> FORESTS ARE N'T FARMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often hear opinions similar to Howard Graham ( Letters , September 3 ) . <p> " Consider this , " he writes , " Once a forest grows old , it is destined for destruction . If fire does not destroy it , insects and decay will . " <p> Well , forests do n't " grow old " in the same way a single tree does . A forest is a complex system that constantly regenerates itself . Long before humans were walking on this Earth , wild fires could rage unchallenged . Insects and decay have had millions of years to reduce the world 's forests to sawdust , yet forests covered the Earth . <p> Howard Graham goes on to write , " Our Western forests might be compared to farm crops . When a crop is mature , the prudent farmer harvests it . " Unfortunately for Mr. Graham , a forest can not be compared to a farm crop . A farm crop is grown on specially prepared land , devoid of vegetation that may compete with it . It is seeded to mature and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many different plants and trees that live in a symbiotic relationship . Clear-cuts do not differentiate between immature or mature trees or the coexisting plants destroyed in the process . I ca n't believe I 've got to explain this . <p> If Howard Graham is looking for a reason fires have devastated so much of his beloved " farmland , " he need only read the recent article in The Chronicle that attributes 65 percent of forest fires to human causes . Unfortunately , too many people ca n't see the forest for the trees . <p> HUGH DALTON <p> Eureka ( Humboldt County ) <p> . <p> NO-BID CONTRACT PROFITS <p> Editor  --  Caltrans has been contracting in recent years with private firms to design and inspect freeways , work formerly performed by Caltrans engineers . Richard Karns ' September 13 letter was entitled , " Contracting Out Works . " Well , it sure works for the big private companies and political contributors , but not for the taxpayer or the traveling public . <p> The member firms in Mr. Kearns ' coalition are given $ 150 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Based on data from the state budget , the legislative analyst and other reputable sources , the excessive profits from these contracts result in a waste of $ 80 million of tax money per year . Of course , many of these firms make substantial contributions to Governor Wilson and other political decision-makers in order to ensure that the wasteful no-bid contracts keep flowing their way . <p> The wasted $ 80 million per year could have been used for seismic retrofitting of bridges before they collapse in an earthquake , rather than repairing them later , or for other highway safety improvements . Unless the current administration stops giving huge no-bid contracts to its political contributors , the massive waste and political payoffs will continue . <p> BRUCE J. BLANNING <p> Professional Engineers in <p> California Government <p> Sacramento <p> . <p> TOXIC SITES ' CLEANUP <p> Editor  --  Thank you for The Chronicle 's interest in Senate Bill 923 , a Superfund reform measure , which I authored . However , I was dismayed by the gross mischaracterization of the legislation in the August 30 article , " Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The article ignored the critical fact that these toxic sites are already paved over pursuant to existing law . Meanwhile , responsible parties engage in endless litigation over who will be liable . SB 923 encourages these parties to tear down the fences and begin cleanup of contaminated property according to a plan determined by the state Department of Toxic Substances Control and local governments . <p> While health , safety and environmental concerns remain the primary consideration at all times , SB 923 allows sites intended for industrial use to be cleaned to that specification while it requires all residential sites to be cleaned in a manner safe for children . Treatment for toxic " hot spots " will exceed the standard in current law by mandating treatment or removal of the contamination . <p> In June 1991 , following its scholarly three-part series on the failures of Superfund , The Chronicle asked lawmakers to " revisit the law and tackle again the thorny compromises that have turned Superfund into a dirty word . " With that challenge in mind , I am disappointed that your news coverage did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform legislation . <p> CHARLES M. CALDERON <p> State Senate , 26th District <p> Montebello ( Los Angeles County ) <p> . <p> LESSONS FROM THE PAST <p> Editor  --  Thank you for printing Benjamin Pimentel 's narration of the pilgrimage to Tule Lake , " A Journey to Reclaim a Painful Past " ( Chronicle , September 1 ) . <p> Unfortunately , the shameful placement of Americans into internment camps over 50 years ago is often omitted from or mentioned only briefly in U.S. history classes . It is crucial that we not only remember this tragedy but also internalize the lessons which retrospect enable us to understand with rare lucidity . We can not be lulled into a false sense of security by believing that such a gross civil rights violation could not happen again today . <p> It is true that the war hysteria which consumed our nation in the 1940s created an unusually hostile environment for Japanese Americans ; but the rampant racial prejudice that made the virtual imprisonment of U.S. citizens acceptable to the majority of the nation remains a part of the American reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an atrocity , the " younger generation " of Americans of Japanese ( and non-Japanese ) descent must listen to the stories of those who have suffered . Only then can we identify the sometimes subtle but always vicious manifestations of racial hatred today . By speaking out against injustice , we can move closer toward creating a world where the rights of all people are upheld and respected . <p> SARITA CANNON <p> Cambridge , Mass . <p> . <p> OOPS <p> EDITOR  --  Perhaps people would put more faith in the rantings of columnist Debra Saunders if she could demonstrate some basic knowledge about the subjects she gets paid to write about . " SSI " stands for " Supplemental Security Income , " not " Social Security Income . " <p> What an idiot . <p> BRIAN NASH <p> Ukiah ( Mendocino County ) <p> . <p> THANKS <p> Editor  --  Thanks from the triplets : We want to thank all of the readers who responded and sent us information about Nebraska , North Dakota and Delaware for our school project in Yuba City . Everything was appreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NICAMORA URUETA <p> Tierra Buena School <p> Yuba City ( Yuba County )
