<p> The seams in the social fabric have long since frayed at the Campbell Village housing project in West Oakland . Around the corner sits Happy Time Liquors , where nobody standing outside looks particularly happy . The rims on the two basketball courts in the project are bent nearly perpendicular to the ground . There are kids playing there anyway . <p> The whole place has a claustrophobic feel : one way in , one way out . The apartments are tucked back off the street , across from Prescott Elementary School . The sight lines go only as far as the nearest building . A couple of blocks over , a wall is spray-painted with a message that says , " African people still are n't free . " <p> It 's a hard place in which to live , and a harder place in which to grow up ; nothing about it seems to breed hope or optimism . In some circles , it is known , without a trace of irony , as " The Lower Bottoms . " <p> Demetrius " Hook " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Most people think if your back is against the wall , there 's another wall in front of you about to smash you . " <p> Mitchell is 26 years old , and he has lived here his entire life , from the time his parents abandoned him at birth until now . From Prescott Elementary to McClymonds High School to Contra Costa College to Cal-State Hayward , you could always find him here . He lives with his maternal grandmother , Johnnie Mae Mitchell , and he plays basketball . <p> This is where the rock is thrown into the water , and the ripples spread . Mitchell 's story has been told often in the Bay Area , always under the heading , " Playground Legend . " But Mitchell stands for something larger , something that tells us a little bit about where we are and where we might go . People in society 's higher strata might believe stories such as Mitchell 's are just part of the process , that West Oakland and Campbell Village are as natural and unavoidable as Pacific Heights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . As if there 's a choice involved somewhere along the line . <p> " I hurt , I really do , for this kid , " says Contra Costa College basketball coach Odis Allison , who coached Mitchell . " If you only get one thing in life , that 's what you do . He is truly a product of his environment . <p> " If you 're going to look for faults in Demetrius Mitchell , you 're going to have to look for faults in a lot of other places . You have to look for faults at the high school level , with instructors and counselors who could n't look past his athletic ability to give him something in the classroom . This is what takes place for a lot of these kids . At this level , at Contra Costa College , you have to look at what a community college does in the one year or two years that he 's here . Or what we can undo that had been done the previous 18 years . " <p> Mitchell has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , bad things happen . He listens , and he knows , but he ca n't do much about it . <p> " This is all I know , " he says . <p> " Like I 've told Hook since I got to know him , if you hang in the wrong area , bad stuff happens to you , " says Bob Mertens , a public defender in Alameda County . " It 's too bad that 's where he 's from and everything , but that 's how it works . " <p> On December 14 of last year , one of many bad things happened on the streets of West Oakland . A 65-year-old man named Willie Robinson was killed with a baseball bat as he walked down Seventh Street . Robinson had some money on him , and somebody with a baseball bat apparently knew that . It was broad daylight , a Tuesday afternoon . The crime was one of gall and brutality , further evidence that life  --  whether it 's entering the world or leaving it  --  is sometimes considered a disposable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an 11-year-old West Oakland girl and her mother claimed Mitchell was the killer . They used the wrong nickname  --  calling him " Tavio , " a name nobody had ever used in connection with Mitchell  --  but she made the identification . Mitchell is a familiar figure in the area : the guy with the basketball . <p> The Oakland police are strapped . Too many murders , not enough time . So you get an identification , you make an arrest . The paperwork gets cleared , the process moves on . It 's an understood function of the system . In this case , one of those who identified Mitchell eventually admitted it was a fabrication , and sources say the other  --  the 11-year-old girl  --  demanded $ 1 million and a plane ticket to Alabama . She apparently was under the impression that Hook 's fame reached beyond the bounds of West Oakland , and into that realm he so desperately wishes to visit . <p> Mitchell was staying with friends in Las Vegas when the arrest warrant was issued . He was playing basketball and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Nevada campus . He heard from his grandmother that the police were asking around about him . He returned home , where everyone in the neighborhood told him the police were out to shoot him . <p> " That 's how the people think , " Mitchell says . " A lot of people been getting shot by the police because everybody 's got guns . <p> " I had a lot of cousins been in and out of the penitentiary , and I was like my grandmother 's last hope . She worried about me a lot . I came home and turned myself in for her . I did n't know nothing about the whole thing . When things got bad , I just prayed . " <p> Mitchell turned himself in and spent three months in Alameda County 's Santa Rita jail before the charges were discredited and he was released last month . He struck up a friendship with Mertens , his public defender , and he learned the system does n't always have him in its cross hairs . Now he 's back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way to reclaim the dream . <p> Reality can take the heart out of the most vivid dreams , especially the brand of reality Demetrius Mitchell has been forced to face . The cards keep coming from the bottom of the deck . Fatherless , motherless , devoid of any lasting sources of direction , Mitchell found refuge on the basketball court . <p> " I know this kid 's life , " Odis Allison says . " If people would have gone through what this kid went through , they would n't have made it . I know I would n't have made it . " <p> With a touch of sadness  --  the sadness born of knowledge that came too late  --  Mitchell laughs and says his sophomore and junior years at McClymonds were spent in the gym , not the classroom . <p> " You might think this is funny , but I spent six periods a day in the gym , " he says . " I look back on those things , and I wish I would n't have done those things . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although just 5-foot-10 , he won slam-dunk contest after slam-dunk contest  --  as many as 50 . He became legendary in a short period of time ; jumping over a car to win a dunk contest will go a long way toward creating and cementing a legend . He averaged more than 20 points per game in two seasons at Contra Costa , then led the Cal- State Hayward team in scoring in 1989-90 before financial and academic problems forced him to leave the school . <p> The near-magical leaping ability  --  a vertical leap of more than 50 inches  --  served to obscure Mitchell 's basketball talents . It turned him into a local sideshow , and a source of pride . There was a certain communal uplift brought about by the sheer joy of pure potential . <p> The first thing you notice about Mitchell 's talent is the suddenness of it , the immediacy of the athleticism . His is not a gliding , graceful game ; it is right now , enough to suck the air from your lungs . There is , in a way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finishes a dunk . <p> Antonio Davis of the Indiana Pacers was a high school teammate at McClymonds . His friends include NBA players Jason Kidd , Gary Payton , Brian Shaw , Isaiah Rider and Henry Turner . Mitchell says he ca n't put words to what he feels watching Payton or Shaw or Rider play in the NBA . <p> " Mostly wondering , What if ? " he says . " What if I 'd done the right things ? " <p> " I totally believe if Demetrius had a stronger support system , he 'd be in the NBA right now , " says Aaron Goodwin , an East Bay sports agent whose clients include Kidd , Payton , Davis and Turner . " Demetrius Mitchell , at his apex a couple of years ago , was as good as any shooting guard in the NBA , and he 's 5-10 . <p> " Jason Kidd knows this , and he and I have talked about it : The difference between him and Demetrius Mitchell is Ann and Steve ( Kidd 's parents ) . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you Demetrius Mitchell has more talent . I 've seen Demetrius blow past Mitch Richmond and dunk on Manute Bol with about 40 people watching . " <p> Mitchell 's father spent nearly eight years in a federal penitentiary for robbing a savings and loan . His mother has an extensive criminal background and has used more than a dozen aliases . Both were gone from the start . <p> Mitchell thanks God for his grandmother , Johnnie Mae Mitchell , who raised him from birth . <p> " There were a lot of people trying to help Hook , " says David Barksdale , Mitchell 's close friend and basketball partner . " Nothing against his grandmother , because she 's a great person , but none of the people trying to help him was a mother or a father . <p> " Part of the problem with his past is that people made excuses for him . I was one of those , I guess . People knew about the problems with where he came from and all that , and made excuses . They shined it away because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodwin : " I do n't think any of us  --  and I include myself  --  pushed him enough to use his abilities . He was such a personality and such a talent that more people were enamored with him than tried to push him to be a better player . " <p> The most profound influence in Mitchell 's life was Larry Parker , who died in an East Oakland parking lot seven years ago , his body perforated with at least 20 bullets . Parker was 21 years old , a West Oakland drug dealer who treated Mitchell as his personal philanthropy project . <p> " Larry Parker was my biggest influence in life , " Mitchell says . " He used to sell drugs or whatever , but he used to try to make me do good . Everybody used to think he was a bad influence on me , but he was the best influence I ever had . He used to try to keep me away from drugs , and telling me to go play basketball . He was selling drugs , there was no question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Parker would pay Mitchell $ 100 a dunk during Mitchell 's senior year at McClymonds . He would buy Mitchell basketball shoes , too . Before long , Parker 's expenses were getting out of control ; Mitchell dunked too much . <p> " I made so much money he had to drop it down from $ 100 to $ 50 , " Mitchell says . " I was dunking too much . I used to tell players on my team , ' Hey , get me the ball , man . I 'm getting $ 100 a dunk . If I 'm up there with you , I 'll give you about $ 5 or $ 10 . I 'll buy you all dinner , breakfast , beer , whatever . ' " <p> Parker 's positive influence on Mitchell is part of a phenomenon that people outside the urban orbit would find impossible to understand . Parker knew the other side , knew the dead end he was facing and knew Mitchell could easily find the map and end up in the same place . Parker dealt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking dead . He saw Mitchell 's talent and thought he could help . This was his contribution to the community . <p> " He was sure I was going to make it , " Mitchell says . " He wanted me to do it because he played basketball and the coach did n't like him . Then it was my turn to play basketball and he had me with all brand new shoes , everything I wanted . He taped all my basketball games . I was the only one in high school with games on tape . " <p> Mitchell runs through the names of friends and acquaintances who have died on the streets . It 's a lengthy , numbing list . It starts with full names , then descends into first names only , then a few nicknames . <p> Here , in The Lower Bottoms , the death of young African American men is looked upon as inevitable and beyond human control , similar to the changing of seasons . <p> Somebody 's saying a team in a Turkish professional league needs players . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other places where players are paid . There 's the United States Basketball League , where all the players are 6-foot-5 and under . That would be perfect . Mitchell still has another year of college eligibility remaining , but it has to be a nonscholarship school or one in the National Athletic Intercollegiate Association . <p> It is n't over yet . He is n't finished with basketball , because he ca n't be . When this is over , then what ? <p> " I tried to help him ; I could see the kid needed help , needed someone to be positive , " says Goodwin . " He needed someone to tell him he 's got to go to school , you ca n't hang out , you 've got to get your rest . <p> " I 've tried diligently to get him placed on a CBA team , but it 's a situation where it 's kind of hard because of what he 's been through . He represents a lot of African Americans today who are talented on the high school level but get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though he 's from the streets , he 's fought like mad to stay off them . <p> " Hook is this legendary playground figure . Demetrius is someone who should move ahead in his life . " <p> Mitchell has never had a driver 's license . He does n't see the need to carry identification  --  unless you count the omnipresent basketball in his large , strong hands . <p> If he needs a ride to a game  --  Sacramento , San Francisco , somewhere closer  --  he puts out the word . The people around the village know Hook , and they want to help . They also want to watch . <p> " I can always get a ride , because a lot of people like to watch me play basketball , " Mitchell says . " I can just say , ' I need a ride over here . I 'm about to go to this game . ' They say , ' What ? ' By then , I 'd have about two carloads ready to go just to watch me play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a 3-on-3 tournament or a dunk contest or something else basketball- related , he sometimes takes up a collection in the neighborhood . <p> " We 're driving around there whenever I go to pick him up , and Hook says , ' We got ta go here ; we got ta go here , ' " says Barksdale . " In that area , it 's making me nervous . I 'm not scared of things , but I know what all these people are doing . So I finally told him , ' When I come down there , you be ready and we 're going . ' <p> " That 's the way it 's been . There were always people who had good intentions for Hook , but they were n't the type of people to say , ' You need to be playing basketball or reading a book . ' They realize he 's a talented player , and they 're willing to help him out any way they can . " <p> Says Allison of Contra Costa College : " At some point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitchell , playground legend , ' and start looking at him as ' Demetrius Mitchell , citizen . ' We fail to let him release himself from his athletic ability . We hold him to that , and it 's not fair . His athletic career is finished ; it was a nice piece of history . Now he needs to learn how to be John Q. Citizen . " <p> Mitchell is good enough to dream . Still . But the dream has its stifling aspects . The dream , in many ways , is an illegitimate one . One in a million high school players makes it to get paid to play basketball . <p> " I do n't want his story to be ' Oakland  --  either you make it or you do n't , ' " Goodwin says . " This is n't a what-went-wrong story . I 'm from Oakland , and I did n't make it in athletics . We need to move away from that . I 'd like to see Demetrius use his skills to lecture young people , to tell them they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's an intelligent kid . He can grow . He can go beyond the playground legend . <p> " There are a lot of Hook Mitchells in Oakland . There 's only one Demetrius Mitchell . " <p> The scene stays with you long after you leave . Hours later , maybe days , the mind will return to the vision of little children playing on a rutted piece of concrete , throwing a basketball through a vandalized hoop . There 's something simultaneously happy and tragic in their eyes , and those eyes stay imprinted in the mind , their image burned into the retinas . <p> The cycle continues . Hope is a leather ball with rubber seams . Hope is hoping a 50-inch vertical will levitate a young man away from it all . Away from Campbell Village and Happy Time Liquors and the guys on the corner . Away from whatever temptations and realities exist where there 's one way in , one way out . Away from the corner apartment and one address your whole life . <p> There are success stories out there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers a big house . They 've got the look , the life , the game . They 're proof that it can happen , proof that magic sometimes comes packaged in flesh and bone . At the same time , they propagate the myth , turn something untouchable and infinite into something real and accessible . <p> They are the reason Demetrius Mitchell keeps playing , keeps dreaming . <p> He is walking outside the apartment , thanking everyone for their time in his disarmingly polite manner . He is happy and free , and any minute now a friend will arrive to take him to a game . Everything is good again . A little boy of about 8 is walking toward the courts . He is bouncing a ball , and his step seems to gather purpose as he nears the court . <p> Demetrius Mitchell smiles and points to the young player . <p> " There 's another Hook , " he says . " Right there  --  another Hook . "
