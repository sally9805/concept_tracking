NATION <P> Tidings of Comfort and Jobs <P> The U.S. economy delivered an outpouring of good cheer as the Christmas shopping season got into full swing . The economy created a whopping 350,000 new jobs in November , far exceeding the forecast of economists and dropping the unemployment rate .2% , to a four-year low of 5.6% . The new jobs helped boost the Conference Board 's index of consumer confidence in November to its highest level in four years ; the personal income of Americans grew a healthy 1.4% . Measures of consumer spending and manufacturing strength also surged . About the only dissonant note was the likelihood that all the good news will cause the Federal Reserve , which has already jacked up interest rates six times this year , to raise them again by early 1995 in order to slow the economy and keep inflation in check . <P> GATT Passes <P> Both the House and Senate voted  --  with large bipartisan majorities  --  to enact historically wide-ranging changes to the 124-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , or GATT . Among other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removes trade quotas and , for the first time , protects intellectual property . <P> America 's Newest Minority <P> Winter 's coming took on a symbolic chill for congressional Democrats as they eulogized 40 years of majority rule during a last lame-duck session , convened for GATT . Preparations for the bleak unknown began with Democratic House leadership elections . Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri briefly climbed out of his hospital bed to secure the nod as minority leader before returning for a gallbladder operation ; he will be joined by newly elected minority whip David Bonior of Michigan and California 's Vic Fazio , now the House Democratic caucus chairman . In the Senate , Tom Daschle of South Dakota was voted in as minority leader over Connecticut 's Christopher Dodd . On the other side of the aisle , veteran Senate Republican whip Alan Simpson of Wyoming was edged out by Mississippi 's Trent Lott for the party 's No. 2 leadership spot , while Kansan Bob Dole was unsurprisingly elected majority leader . <P> Whitewater Springs Anew <P> Former Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell has tentatively agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evasion , the first charges brought by Kenneth Starr , the Whitewater independent counsel . Hubbell , a longtime friend of President and Mrs. Clinton 's , is a former law partner of the First Lady 's . Sources close to Hubbell 's family told Time that it was " cheaper and easier " to settle . Hubbell had already spent $1 million to defend himself against an investigation so exhaustive that even the bank account of his 22-year-old son was examined  --  all the way back to the sixth grade . Curiously , despite Starr 's involvement , the charges relate to Whitewater only tangentially . Said a source close to the Clintons : " They ( ( stem from ) ) Mr. Hubbell 's billing procedures as an attorney in private practice before he came to Washington .
