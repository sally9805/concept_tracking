DR . BRY BENJAMIN WILL NEVER FORGET the first time he helped a patient commit suicide . It was more than a quarter-century ago . An elderly couple came to his office , husband and wife , both terminally ill and in terrible agony with cancer . " They told me they would like a supply of pills on hand just in case , " recalls the 71-year-old New York City internist . The law forbade him to agree ; his conscience dictated otherwise . In the end , his conscience won , but Benjamin had to wrestle with this ethical dilemma alone . At the time , doctors did n't even whisper among themselves about assisted suicide , much less debate it in medical journals . <P> Suddenly doctors are talking about little else . In a decision that took legal scholars and medical ethicists by surprise last week , the Second Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a New York State law that prohibited physicians from helping their patients die . It 's already legal for doctors to withhold or withdraw treatment at a patient 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the final stages of a terminal disease , mentally competent and able to take a lethal dose of medicine on his or her own , the state ca n't bar a doctor from prescribing that dose . <P> Taken alone , the three-judge panel 's decision would be important enough , but it comes after a similar ruling last month by the Ninth Circuit Court in San Francisco , also one of the nation 's most influential appeals courts . Unless the Supreme Court reverses both decisions  --  and there 's no guarantee it will even hear the cases  --  the laws against physician-assisted suicide now on the books in a majority of states may be on their way out . " In the past 30 days there have been more developments in this field than there have been in the previous 20 years , " says University of Michigan law professor Yale Kamisar . <P> If so , it means the law is finally catching up to what some physicians have been quietly doing all along . In a survey of Oregon doctors published in the New England Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to help some terminal patients die , and 7% admitted to having done so . The actual number , say ethicists , may be much higher . <P> Yet because the practice has been carried out in private , the medical establishment has yet to develop a consensus on how and when to help a patient die . Until now , explains Leslie Pickering Francis , a professor of law at the University of Utah , " patients who are sophisticated enough to want the aid and physicians who are sympathetic enough to want to give it often do it in such a way that the intent and the knowledge are left deliberately ambiguous . " Only a few , like Dr. Jack Kevorkian , have defied this conspiracy of silence . <P> But now that legal prohibitions against assisted suicide may be crumbling , doctors all over the country could soon be as up front as Kevorkian  --  a prospect that has always disturbed many of them . For one thing , doctors may become more vulnerable to lawsuits because they will suddenly be open to scrutiny by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be held accountable , says Dr. Howard Grossman , one of the three doctors who successfully challenged the New York law , " there must be clear guidelines of what constitutes a terminally ill patient .
