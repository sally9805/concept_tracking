ANITA HILL MAY HAVE SENSITIZED most people to the fact of sexual harassment , but it was an obscure legal secretary at the giant firm of Baker &; McKenzie who sensitized corporate America to the consequences . The precedent-setting $3.5 million award that Rena Weeks won last year against the law firm could not have have been far from the minds of directors at W.R. Grace &; Co. when they ousted the firm 's president and CEO , J.P . Bolduc . Last week the board acknowledged that evidence of sexual harassment was the real reason for his March 2 departure , and in the process created a new corporate milestone . " This is the first time that a company has taken the action of having a CEO leave apparently because of sexual harassment , ' ' says Kathryn Rodgers , executive director of the now Legal Defense and Education Fund . <P> The odd thing about this very modern melodrama is that it was played out among the septuagenarians on the board of Grace , whose founder , Irishman William Grace , started the venture back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. for use as fertilizer . Perhaps more predictably , last week 's admission came only after weeks of obfuscation on the part of the troubled company . The $5 billion conglomerate , which produces everything from plastics to kidney-dialysis equipment , initially blamed Bolduc 's abrupt departure on " differences of style and philosophy . " <P> But after the New York Times obtained a preliminary draft of the firm 's upcoming proxy statement , which cited unspecified evidence that Bolduc , 55 , had harassed five female employees , Grace conceded that the allegations had inspired the board to oust him . One director said the findings included documentation from five different areas of the company ; the Times reported that his misconduct involved making " suggestive remarks ' ' and " engaging in unwelcome physical contact ' ' with the employees . <P> To be fair , the company noted in lawyerly prose that Bolduc , who is married and has four children , " vehemently denied and continues to deny " any sexual misconduct . Grace further pointed out that none of the women who came forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former CEO . As a result , Grace said , its directors decided " to request Mr. Bolduc 's resignation , but not to seek his termination for cause . " <P> The timing of Bolduc 's ouster raised questions in some quarters about whether the board might have used the harassment charges as the ultimate weapon in a long-standing corporate power struggle . Before his departure , Bolduc had repeatedly clashed with then chairman J. Peter Grace , 81 , who suffers from lung cancer . Among other things , Bolduc wanted the company to disclose to its shareholders that it was spending , among other things , $165,000 on Grace 's annual nursing care and $200,000 a year for his security guards . <P> Says Bolduc attorney Gerald Walpin : " After Mr. Bolduc responsibly acted as a corporate officer , suddenly charges were made , when there had never been a complaint of harassment before . " Walpin added that his client " was never given any opportunity to face any of his alleged accusers , or even to know the identity of any of his accusers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
