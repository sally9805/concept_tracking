" Sparky " Watts ( Michael Hayden ) , a Navy lieutenant stationed in Japan in 1954 , has a poop deck full of problems . He 's trying to hide a Japanese girlfriend from his stuffy family back home . His roommate is being blackmailed into passing military secrets . The tart wife of his commanding officer is putting moves on him . Gurney , the prolific chronicler of Wasp life ( The Dining Room , Love Letters ) , seems a bit out of his depth in this plotty drama , which raises ( but does n't grapple with ) issues ranging from homosexuality in the military to the origins of Vietnam . But the compact grace of his writing and Daniel Sullivan 's delicate direction make it a diverting reminder of the kind of play that does n't get written much anymore . <P>  --  By Richard Zoglin
