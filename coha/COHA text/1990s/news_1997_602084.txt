<p> EGG HARBOR TOWNSHIP , N.J.  --  The skating-themed balloons are perfectly tethered . Happy Birthday streamers are strung . The guests have arrived . <p> We have a problem ! <p> Matt Hunter , who 's set to blow out the 14 candles on the in-line skating cake , marches over to the pinata that his mother has just hung from a tree . It , too , is shaped like a skate , but it 's not quite right . <p> Matt rips off the papier-mache brake built into the heel and tosses it into the trash . His broad , self-assured smile says it all : He 's hosting the perfect aggressive-skating birthday party . And aggressive means no brakes . <p> Aggressive or extreme sports  --  trick skating , skateboarding and biking  --  are no longer exclusive to the progressive California dude . Driveways across the USA have become the breeding ground for youths as young as 6 and 7 who are using two- , four- and eight-wheeled toys to attempt flips , spins , jumps and an array of airborne stunts . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in communities into battlegrounds pitting pedestrians against daredevils with their wheeled weaponry while the medical community scurries to deal with potential injuries . <p> With extreme sports still in their infancy , it 's too early for specific medical statistics . Unspecified in-line skating injuries treated in hospital emergency rooms have nearly tripled since 1993  --  from 36,986 to 102,819 last year  --  according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission . Participation in in-line skating among youths 6-17 , though , has quadrupled . <p> Some experts will say at least the kids are moving . As youth participation in every traditional sport declines , in-line skating is the fastest-growing sport among youngsters . The Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association ( SGMA ) reports 7.9 million participants ages 6-17 in 1996 . Another study by Teenage Research Unlimited shows boys age 12 to 15 are more interested in extreme sports than professional baseball . <p> " You get a good workout , and it 's a challenge , " says in-line skater Matt Kreutzer , 13 . He and Hunter are members of a neighborhood skating club , the 609 sk8 crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have to have challenges in your life , " he says , " or you 'll get bored . " <p> While participants , experts and parents do n't concur on safety measures , they do all agree that extreme sports are not a passing phase and as the practice continues to grow among younger and younger children , it needs immediate attention . <p> " There 's a valid reason for concern . The ( extreme ) formula has all the ingredients for a high injury rate , " says Dr. Steven Anderson , who chairs the American Academy of Pediatrics ' task force on sports medicine . The topic was first brought up at the group 's May meeting when it received its first letter from a pediatrician asking what advice to give to parents . " We 're going to have to formally look at it , so the academy may have some official position about whether this is a safe and reasonable activity for children , " he says . " I 'm trying to imagine a scenario where the benefits outweigh the risks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has rivaled this ever , " says the SGMA 's Mike May , who says even basketball , traditionally the sport most played by kids , never reached skating 's high mark . It 's " surprising , " he says , that raw data from 1996 shows a decline in kids ' participation in nine of the top 10 sports . Only in-line skating registered an increase . <p> As extreme sports become more popular among the young , grown-ups are concerned that there is no watchdog body . " It 's an interesting phenomenon . Who 's going to do it ? Certainly not the manufacturers , " says Jim Garrick of the San Francisco Center for Sports Medicine , St. Francis Memorial Hospital . <p> Most traditional sports have oversight . " Colleges , high schools keep the health of participants in mind , " Garrick says . " With these sports , there are n't any watchdogs . " <p> Kids say they like that there 's no Big Brother . Extreme sports offer complete individuality and growing at your own pace . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what to do , " says Dave Werner , 18 , a skateboarder practicing in a park in Brigantine , N.J. " It 's like you 're in control . It 's all freelance . " <p> No parents putting on pressure to get the college scholarship . The playing field is level : Most kids of any size have the same potential . You 're never too short . You 're never too small . <p> Extreme is for " your typically normal kid that likes to be on the edge , " says Gary Ream , president of Camp Woodward , a Woodward , Pa. , camp devoted to extreme sports and gymnastics . " I do n't think they 're any different than we were as kids . " <p> Extreme has a lock not only on our children , he adds , but on society as a whole . In fact , the term " extreme " is getting so mainstream these days that followers of the sport have moved on . " ' Extreme ' is now out , " Ream says . " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start making aggressive this or that , there will be another name . " <p> Madison Avenue has also caught on to extreme . Many say the marketing of extreme is fueling the sports . Thanks to ESPN and Mountain Dew and AT &T,; neighborhood kids embrace thrill-seeking pastimes with visions of corporate sponsorship dancing in their heads . ESPN 's Extreme Games begat local competitions across the USA , many with cash prizes . <p> " People think that you ca n't make a career out of it , " says Frank Cambell , a 15-year-old Philadelphian who mimics much of what 's being said in local skate parks . " But if you get sponsored , they send you everything you need . And if you get sponsored for a year they give you like $ 1,000 ! " <p> Look at it from a regular kid 's view , says the Academy of Pediatrics ' Anderson . " ' Because responsible adults are promoting it , then how could it be dangerous ? ' " he says . To them , it 's " ' Look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid , and I can travel and go to fun places . ' That 's a driving force that will push people to go beyond their physical limits . " <p> And if kids are n't risking injury on the jumps for the sake of a local skate shop , they 're risking injury on the streets , where skaters share the pavement with cars and bicyclists . <p> Legislators are realizing " No Skating " signs are n't the answer . Skaters and skateboarders continue to crowd sidewalks and parks despite being ticketed by police . The answer , many say , are skate parks . In communities across the nation , parks that resemble emptied swimming pools are being built . <p> Jerry Arsenault , 22 , a skateboarder from Vineland , N.J. , has been to several city council meetings asking that a park be built . " They 're just starting to look into it , but it 's taking forever . " The holdup , he says : " They say the insurance is too much . " <p> Council members are turning to Woodward 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking information on skate parks . <p> He warns them : " ' You 've created an image of juvenile delinquents " with restrictions on skating . " If they have a place to do it , it 's a totally different image . " <p> The image : Another problem . <p> " People always think these are kids who smoke and do drugs and drop out of school , " says Brenda Hunter at her son 's birthday party . Matt and his brother , Jake , 15 , attend Christian school and maintain high grades , she says . The 609 sk8 crew are all " good boys , " she says , who come from good families . <p> But their clothes are over-sized ( to fit pads underneath ) . Wallets dangle from chains attached at the belt ( so you do n't lose your money on aerial tricks ) . Some have spray-painted their skates and helmets . <p> That image scares parents , Ream says . And the look is evolving in the early elementary years . " They 're hip at 9 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Thrasher magazine , devoted to skateboarding . <p> " It 's the stereotype that skateboarding is so inherently dangerous , " Thatcher says . " We 're going to be in trouble if we do n't give back to the youth by building skate parks . " <p> Parents of his readers call for advice . He tells them , " Take them to the skate spot . Watch them . Listen . " But do n't stay so long as to embarrass your child . " Disappear when it 's uncool. "
