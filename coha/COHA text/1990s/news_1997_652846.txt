<p> IN the bad old days of the tattoo trade in New York City , artists liked to say there was a piece of equipment almost as essential as the machines they used to limn designs into flesh : the ball-peen hammer . <p> " I had a guy one time getting a tattoo , " explained Freddie Grossman , a k a Coney Island Freddie , a grizzled tattoo artist who opened his first shop in 1956 on Mermaid Avenue , not far from the jam-packed boardwalk . " And this guy says to me , ' Suppose I do n't want to pay you ? ' I kept working . He waits and says , ' Really , suppose I do n't want to pay you ? ' " <p> " So I got tired of hearing him , and I reached over and took my hammer , " Mr. Grossman , 62 , recalled last week near his long-gone shop , his grin a few teeth short of what it once was . " I had it hanging on nails on the back of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I started working again . " <p> " And that , " he said matter-of-factly , " was the end of that conversation . " <p> It is a story that helps measure the true distance between the tattoo shops that once teemed along the city 's ragged fringes  --  the Bowery , Coney Island , the Brooklyn Navy Yard  --  and the dozens of sleek new shops that have emerged , mostly in the East Village , since March , when the city legalized tattooing once again , 36 years after outlawing it during a hepatitis epidemic . <p> Of course , the ban , even as long as it lasted , was unable to strangle the resilient tattoo culture . But it drove many of the older artists out of town and forced others underground , tucked away in back rooms known largely by word of mouth . <p> Today , the city is again becoming a center of the art form . Actors , stockbrokers and college students sink into comfortable chairs on St. Marks Place and enjoy cappuccino  --  not to mention an environment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It 's a long , long way from the days before the ban . But now , forgotten voices like Mr. Grossman 's  --  redolent of the shipyard , the carnival , the street  --  are being resurrected to remember New York City 's once-bawdy tattoo culture . He is one of 11 artists whose accounts are collected in " New York City Tattoo : The Oral History of an Urban Art " ( Hardy Marks Publications ) by Michael McCabe . The book , published this month , is a who 's who of tattooists in the 1940 's and 50 's , with an introduction by Hubert Selby Jr. , whose 1964 novel , " Last Exit to Brooklyn , " chronicled dispossessed lives not unlike those that surface in the book . <p> It was a time when the modern form first flourished , in the city where mechanized tattooing was invented  --  by a Bowery tinkerer named Samuel O'Reilly , who modified Edison 's electric engraving pen in the 1890 's to make the first tattoo machine . <p> Among fanciers of New York tattoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have acquired the air of myth : Brooklyn Blackie , the Moskowitz brothers , Tattoo Lou Rubino , Crazy Eddie Funk . <p> Mr. McCabe , 41 , a tattoo artist since the early 80 's who collected the stories and historical photographs that accompany them , said he began the book not long after meeting an elderly man in Hoboken , N.J. , whose arms were a blue-green palimpsest of tattoo history . One blurry image had been etched there by Charlie Wagner , a founding father of Manhattan tattooing , who worked on the Bowery from the turn of the century until the early 1950 's . <p> Mr. McCabe persuaded the man to sit for an interview the next time they were both in Hoboken . But when he returned months later , the man had died . " And it really hit me : this is all going to be gone , a whole segment of New York City history , with these people , " said Mr. McCabe , who was a consultant on New York 's first comprehensive exhibition on tattooing , at the Drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started looking for voices and stories . " <p> Until the ban , the largest communities of tattoo artists thrived on the Bowery , near where the very first electric tattoo shops opened on Chatham Square ; on Coney Island near Nathan 's , and along Sands Street near the Brooklyn Navy Yard , which until the end of World War II supplied an unending stream of sailors from around the world . More likely than not , both the customers and the practitioners grew up in hardscrabble neighborhoods , and the shops often became equal parts sideshow , boxing ring and safe house . Or as Coney Island Freddie put it in the book : " In them days , forget about it . Whatever tattoo shop you walked in on , you knew you were in someplace you did n't belong . " <p> The old-time artists , many of whom have parlors on Long Island , in New Jersey or in the far-flung cities where they moved after the ban , rarely considered themselves artists . Tattooing was a trade , a job that allowed them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their peers , though the hours they put in during busy summers were probably just as grueling . <p> " Brooklyn Blackie swears that he tattooed 200 people in one day , " Mr. McCabe said during a morning stroll in Brooklyn with Coney Island Freddie , who now has a shop on Staten Island , and Tattoo Lou Rubino , 57 , who works with his 27-year-old son in Selden , on Long Island . <p> Mr. Rubino recalled that the Moskowitz brothers , Stanley and Walter , believed to be the last artists to tattoo legally on the Bowery , and another well-known artist , Tony Polito , were virtual tattoo factories , preaching speed and consistency above everything . <p> " Tony 's work was like , bang , he stamped it on and that was it , " Mr. Rubino said . " He says to me once , ' Hey , Lou , I can do a Christ 's head faster than anybody . ' And I said to him , ' Yeah , Tony , but what does it look like ? ' A lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit could have had some artistic work walking around on arms today , but that was n't what it was about then . " <p> The early customers , nearly all of them men , sought out imagery for their arms and chests  --  eagles , snakes , anchors , hearts  --  that had even then been around for hundreds of years in the tradition of manual tattooing . The customers were flamboyant characters like Dick Hyland , a heavily tattooed Bowery regular of many aliases , whose real name , Stanley Moskowitz said , was Bernard Rothenberg . <p> " He got kicked out of California , " Mr. Moskowitz recalled . " The human autograph , he was . Ripley wanted his skin . They wanted his skin when he died . I do n't think it was allowed to take a skin off a human . He was tattooed everywhere . The first piece he ever got was a chest piece about the Spanish-American War . " <p> Classic motifs remain in most modern tattooists ' arsenal of images , though options today are much more varied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Marilyn Monroe , Elvis and other icons . <p> ASSESSING the gentrified tattoo scene , longtime artists do not try hard to hide their disdain . " It 's all store-bought now , " Mr. Grossman said . " They go to a course to learn how to do it . Or worse yet , they go to art school . Art school ! And they order all of their equipment out of a catalogue . If something breaks , they order a new one . There 's no connection to the tools anymore . " <p> But even the old-timers concede that tattoos have evolved into much finer , more nuanced creations since their prime . " In my youth , " Mr. Rubino said , " if you could n't tell what a tattoo was from 20 or 30 feet away it was n't a good tattoo . Then , it was about thick , solid lines and basic colors . Simple . " <p> Examining the delicate Tibetan snakes and phoenixes curving around Mr. McCabe 's arms , he said : " If we had tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown blob . " <p> Paradoxically , one of the most visible transformations in tattooing came in perhaps the only area where the older practitioners were innocents : disease control . In lifting the ban , health officials said this year that no case of hepatitis had ever been conclusively traced to tattooing in New York City . But the specter of communicating disease through their needles , especially in the age of AIDS , has forced newer tattoo artists to become much more careful . <p> By September , the City Health Department hopes to administer , for the first time , multiple-choice tests on sterilization procedures and hygiene to artists as part of a licensing process that has just begun . <p> Officials say they have no idea how many new artists have moved into New York since the law changed in March but estimate that 50 tattooists have been operating underground in the last few years . <p> During the three decades of the ban , getting a tattoo in the city meant knowing someone who knew someone , or deciphering obscure advertisements in the backs of weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolder , propping up discreet signs , but the drill for getting inside a parlor could still seem as sinister as a drug deal . <p> Mike Bakaty , who had operated in secret since the 1970 's , said that in the last year at least a dozen new parlors had popped up around his brand-new storefront at First Avenue and First Street . <p> " It 's getting kind of crazy , " Mr. Bakaty said , wearing rubber gloves as he tattooed a wolf onto the right arm of a 21-year-old college student . <p> Though many older artists say they had maintained an informal and adequate standard of cleanliness on their own , many also get a good laugh when asked how they would have responded to an order to take a multiple-choice test . <p> Mr. Grossman and Mr. Rubino recalled that in the late 1950 's , fearing a crackdown by health officials , some tattoo artists made a stab at more visible safety procedures .
