<p> On a cold , Saturday afternoon in December , most people in Chicago 's River North neighborhood are dashing in and out of various boutiques in an attempt to avoid the wind-whipping chill . It 's one of those days when convincing someone that Chicago is nicknamed the " Windy City " for its politics , not its weather , is impossible . Yet along a small stretch of Clark Street , dozens of people brave the elements and stand quietly in line on the sidewalk . <p> These frigid folks are standing in line simply to get a seat at Frontera Grill . <p> Frontera Grill , a relatively casual , superb Mexican restaurant , first opened its doors more than 10 years ago . In 1989 , Topolobampo , Frontera Grill 's elegant sister restaurant , opened next to Frontera Grill . By restaurant standards , both establishments are seasoned veterans . But diners continue to flock to them , and word continues to spread across the country about chef Rick Bayless . <p> Bayless is thin and handsome , and converses fluently in Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his neatly trimmed goatee . When working in his restaurants , Bayless usually dons a reddish baseball cap over his wavy , brown hair . <p> He 's constantly juggling various projects in his rather busy life ; he 's truly a man of many hats . A chef 's toque just is n't one of them . <p> Bayless is n't Mexican  --  " I 'm a mutt American , " he says  --  but he is all about Mexico . <p> He considers Mexico to be " as exotic as anything you find in Southeast Asia . " Yet he says , " People have no clue about it . . . . It has never been understood . <p> " There 's a very strong prejudice , and has been for several centuries , against anything that comes from Mexico . And I think there 's this general unspoken sense of threat that it is such a foreign country that people do n't even want to admit much about it because they 're afraid what that means to have something so foreign so close , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who helps others better understand Mexico and its flavorful , often complex cuisine . He received his undergraduate degree in Spanish and Latin American Culture at the University of Oklahoma , and did doctoral work in linguistics at the University of Michigan . Bayless contends that " food is a lot like language . " <p> " If I gave you a book written in Spanish and you do n't read Spanish , it 's not going to mean anything to you . <p> " The mission of our restaurant is to present the best Mexican food done in the most true to form style , cast in a way that people can really understand it here , " says Bayless . " And we do that through the education of ourselves , our staff and our customers . " <p> Bayless ' education began in Oklahoma , where his parents ran the Hickory House , a slow-smoke barbecue restaurant that offered 30 different side orders , all made from scratch . His love of Mexico formed early . " I started going to Mexico when I was 14 . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I got there I just fell in love with it . " He 's been back every year since then . <p> Every year his restaurants shut down for a week , and he travels with his staff to Mexico . In July , they visited the state of Tabasco , an area with a strong Mayan heritage . <p> The trips can be rejuvenating . Bayless says , " We always come back and put together immediately a menu from the place that we went to . " Since his restaurants primarily focus on cuisine from the central and Southern portions of Mexico , creating food from Tabasco was different . " It was like coming to a new restaurant every day , " he says . <p> Bayless ' wife , Deann , is the co-proprietor of Frontera Grill and Topolobampo . Rick and Deann met in Ann Arbor , Mich. , and they are the parents of a spirited , blond 6-year-old girl , Lanie . Rick and Deann built a playroom in the basement of the restaurant to help integrate Lanie into their world . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with and be married to the same person . Deann says , " There are some very fundamental things we do to make it work . First of all , we 're incredibly respectful of the other 's role . . . and we keep our roles pretty clearly defined in the restaurant . I manage the front . He manages the back . I do the business . He does atmosphere , decor  --  pretty much he does all the creative side and I do much more of the nitty-gritty things . " <p> Rick says , " Probably many couples do n't have as equal a relationship as Deann and I do . I think we both really respect each other for our own strengths . " They 've been married for 20 years . <p> They chose Chicago for Frontera Grill for several reasons . Bayless says that he always wanted to live in a " huge city " and Deann 's family lived in the area . <p> Chicago is a city of " straightforward " people , Bayless says . <p> " In L.A. , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I did n't want to have to reinvent myself . I wanted to do something that was n't a concept  --  that was something I could do with integri- <p> ty , " he says . <p> " For the first six years that the restaurant was open , I worked a position on the line , " Bayless says . " I love to cook . But this business is big enough now that if I focus on cooking one thing , then I 'm really going to miss my role as the guiding force of the restaurant . Now we have five sous chefs who all are responsible for running chunks of the kitchen , and I work running the sous chefs and pulling them together . " <p> Customers outside the restaurant on Saturdays can peer through the front window and see Bayless gathered with his sous chefs around a table . The meeting 's atmosphere is casual , and Lanie skips by the table several times . Meticulous item counts are given , employee hours are scrutinized , and produce prices are analyzed . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and current dishes are evaluated . <p> They slowly critique every dish they 've tasted recently . A butterscotch pudding with raspberries dessert receives scathing words . " My pudding 's bleeding ! " sous chef Kevin Karales says of the visual effect the raspberries have on the pudding . " It 's jarring to look at ; it 's jarring to eat , " insists Tracey Vowell , a sous chef who 's worked with Bayless for eight years . <p> " We have a very egalitarian kitchen here , " Bayless says . " Everybody can contribute to the menu . It 's not run like the classic European kitchens , where there is one person who is barking commands and you do it exactly how the chef says or you 're out the back door . <p> " I 'm interested in food as an expression of culture and as a way of bringing people together . And I think the better the food , the more I can accomplish that goal . We are not trying to do food as high art ; we are doing food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like crafts often express a culture . " <p> The resulting food at Frontera Grill and Topolobampo is serious and extraordinary , but not , as some customers think , a product of " Rick Bayless ' crazy imagination . " Bayless and his restaurants remain painstakingly loyal to the goal of serving authentic Mexican cuisine . <p> A recent Topolobampo menu included a beautiful appetizer of yellowfin tuna that had been marinated at length in fresh lime and sweet orange juices and then sliced thinly over a sapid salsa of olives , avocados , capers , tomatoes and mint . An entree of roasted , tender pork loin with a complex and rich red pipian is served over braised greens . Delicate sea bass is placed on top of fresh corn tortillas , which are folded and stuffed with salt cod mashed potatoes and garnished with crispy strips of beets . The two restaurants ' menus change about every four weeks . And hard-shelled tacos and burritos are nowhere to be found . Topolobampo 's menu is filled with so many varied and tempting options that the chef 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wise choice . <p> When the chefs ' meeting breaks shortly before 5 p.m. , the pace of activity begins to quicken . A waiter brings Bayless a sampling of a margarita . He sniffs it like a wine connoisseur would sniff a glass of Bordeaux , and then sips it . It 's a little too sweet , Bayless determines , and he seeks to rectify the situation . <p> Back in the kitchen , the cry of " We 're open ! " from the front of the restaurant is barely audible over the din of clanging pots and pans . With a slight grin , Bayless declares , " The race is on . " <p> At lunch and at dinner , Bayless tastes everything that is being served at both restaurants . Starting on the Topolobampo side , Bayless walks down the line tasting every sauce , cheese or garnish in sight before he turns to sample items simmering on the stove . He adds a pinch of salt to the fresh guacamole and adds more sugar to a prickly pear sauce . The same ritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much of Bayless ' time in the kitchens is spent overseeing the entire operation , but he does n't hesitate to jump on line if he thinks an order ticket has been ignored for too long . The frantic and intense activity associated with turning out expertly prepared fare continues throughout the night for the chefs in the kitchen . <p> Just minutes before opening for dinner , the thermostat in the bar is broken , causing a flurry of telephone calls to find an electrician . On the same evening , a private party for 20 is being held in the basement . Not only does such a party require all 20 dishes to be delivered hot at the same time ( while dinner service continues uninterrupted in the restaurants ) , but on this particular night the party has ordered five different entrees . Bayless darts about the kitchen coordinating , cooking , slicing and plating . Ultimately he serves as a waiter , carrying four plates at once as he descends the stairs . <p> The normal feverish activity soon returns , and Bayless can be found sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The commotion circling the area appears lost on the two . She sits bouncing on his knee , and they share a laugh . <p> Flavor is the hallmark of Frontera Grill and Topolobampo , and as far as Bayless is concerned , most chefs are n't trained to work with bold and aggressive flavors . Bayless realizes that Mexican food is still often stereotyped more for its spiciness than its flavor . <p> " Mexican food is very medium on the spice scale compared to Thai food and Indian food and some of the other Southeast Asian cuisines , " he says . " And yet that sort of thing persists because American food up until , say , the early ' 70s , was incredibly bland . <p> " What we have tried to do is to show how within the context of a fine dining establishment , you can go for all of those flavors  --  the flavors that really speak to your soul . " <p> As Bayless works to find balance in the flavors of his cuisine , he also strives for balance in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , different things are important to me , " he says . <p> This master chef is an award-winning author of cookbooks . After spending years living in Mexico , his first cookbook , Authentic Mexican , came out just as Frontera Grill was starting business . In 1996 , he released Rick Bayless 's Mexican Kitchen , which he co-authored with Deann and Jean Marie Brownson . His next book will focus on the vast world of chiles . " There 's so little understanding of the variety of chiles , " says Bayless . He hopes to make people start thinking of chiles as more than a spice . In Mexico chiles are used more like vegetables than as spices . <p> Since 1996 , with the development of Frontera Foods and its product lines of salsas and hot sauces , the reach of his food has no boundaries . <p> Bayless discusses segmenting his product line , low gross margins and price disparities as easily as he talks about straining a sauce or roasting a poblano chile . Although he clearly is comfortable in a business setting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He regularly teaches cooking classes in Chicago as well as across the United States , including at the Culinary Institute of America . He meets weekly around the restaurants ' bar with his waitstaff for food and wine tastings ( wine is taken very seriously , especially at Topolobampo ) , and here , too , he takes on the role of teacher . He explains to the service staff what makes the guacamole at the restaurants stand apart from other guacamoles . He says that all the ingredients are ordinary , but they are hand chopped and mixed right before serving . <p> As if reading from his latest cookbook 's lesson on onions , Bayless explains how the volatile substance in onions that causes people to cry comes from the mixing of onion cell contents when onions are chopped . This same reaction causes what Bayless refers to as the " Mexican-American Restaurant Syndrome , " which leads to that unpleasant aftertaste of many Mexican restaurants . He teaches that the onions at Frontera Grill and Topolobampo are " deflamed " through straining and rinsing and are never cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell walls . <p> He and Deann quiz the staff about the use of moles in Mexican cooking . Moles are usually thickened with nuts , corn or seeds  --  at Frontera Grill and Topolobampo the various moles can contain from 15 to 20 different ingredients . The word " mole " stems from the Aztec word for sauce , Bayless explains , so it has strong pre-Columbian roots . Moles are usually hot and feature chiles , and are always considered special occasion dishes . For example , Bayless says , " You do n't make turkey with stuffing just for Wednesday night dinner . " <p> Bayless is also determined to teach others about sustainable agriculture , encouraging people to use food that is produced in a sustainable way . Bayless maintains a 1,000-square-foot organic food garden at his home in Bucktown , and much of the food he grows is later served in his restaurants . <p> But for Bayless , the idea of sustainability goes much further . " You ca n't say that you use organically raised things and sustainably raised meats and naturally raised this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they drop , " he says . " That 's not a sustainable lifestyle . When I got into this business . the first thing I said is that I 'm going to have a place where people can work for a long time , because we 're going to have a great atmosphere and we 're going to require the right number of hours so that people can feel like they can have a life outside of here . Most of the people in the restaurant work between 40 and 45 hours a week , which is just almost unheard of in their profession . " <p> On top of everything else , Bayless has a passion for art collection and serves as the interior designer of the restaurants . " Our decor changes all the time , " he explains . " One of the things that is paramount in any restaurant is that it needs to look like it opened yesterday . We spend a lot of our energy keeping the place looking fresh . " <p> Bayless chooses all of the art for the restaurants and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking colors abound in the impressive collection of artwork from some of Mexico 's most famous and highly priced artists , including Rodolfo Morales . Various pieces of Mexican folk art are also represented in the dining rooms . <p> Bayless ' mission continues to grow . " After the first of the year , we are going to be establishing the Frontera Institute that will just be an educational thing , " he says . A new kitchen will be built in the institute , which will be located above Topolobampo . <p> " We 're going to have a separate kitchen there for teaching classes . We 'll do both professional classes and ( classes ) for aficionados of good cooking , people who just like to cook at home . All the books and articles and so forth will come out of the institute . " <p> Bayless foresees the institute sponsoring festivals that will bring people from Mexico to the restaurants . " It will be an opportunity for us to really take the educational component of what we do to a more formal level , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , " says Deann . " He can come up with all kinds of things to keep energy and everything infused and alive . . . . I try to keep us touching the ground . " It ca n't be an easy job for her , considering Bayless ' ability to make only the sky the limit .
