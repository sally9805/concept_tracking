Information Lineage // February 14 , 1994 // An austere white stucco house with a roof of ochre tile stands amid the olive groves and vineyards of Chianti . Tight-furled cypresses file uphill along a lane to other villas , other farms . The February sun hangs low in the sky , the icy tramontana slices in from Switzerland , but the grass is already green and the trees are in bud . Except for wisps of radio music brought from the house on the transmountain wind , the landscape is silent and still . // Next to the tile-roofed house there stands a copse of trees in which a pack of wolves is sleeping . // Lifting his antenna high , Edoardo Tedesco grins from beneath a slept-in haystack of graduate-student hair . Tock , goes the receiver , sock . He has found his study wolves . // This is the ancient place of the wolf in our world : nearby , unknown . // " Excellent , " says Tedesco . " The shepherds do not kill them yet . " // In a swale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe watches his sheep . A big white dog lies at his side , also watching . " This is the very old guard dog of Italy , the Maremma , " says Tedesco , " but these shepherds come from Sardinia , where there are no wolves , and they do n't know how to train the Maremma , and when the wolves come , the dogs run away . " // But surely wolves prefer their natural prey ? In Minnesota and northern Montana , hardly any livestock is lost to wolves . // Tedesco gives a sardonic smile . A graduate student in wildlife biology at the University of Rome , he has been studying this pack in Tuscany for two years now . Wolf range has been expanding steadily for the past twenty years from the province of Abruzzo in central Italy , a hundred and fifty miles from this pasture in the legendary winemaking region of Chianti , twelve miles from the city of Siena . These wolves are newcomers . " In the beginning , they stayed in the gorges  --  dense shrub vegetation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red deer . " ( The gentle-looking landscape here is riddled with vertiginous , almost people-proof slashes . ) " But there were not so many wild prey , because of the poaching , and soon the wolves killed most of them , and then they began killing sheep . " // Not many , surely ? // " Two or three thousand last year , killed in the province of Siena only . This alpha male , Alvio , is very clever , very hard to find . Now we have a radio collar on him , and also on a subadult , a male , we call him Fulvio . Thirty , forty sheep this pack alone has killed in two years . " // The shepherds tolerate this ? // " In Italy the wolf is protected absolutely . The owners are compensated , ninety percent of the value , but this does not satisfy them . They tell me , We are going to kill your wolves . ' " // But the law ! // That thin , sardonic , so Italian smile again . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns and trade forbidden poisons , the whole country has a long tradition of wildlife slaughter , there is agriculture nearly everywhere , the human population has been dense for hundreds of years , many laws are deemed no more than wishful guidelines , there is not one speck of what an American would call wilderness  --  yet Italy has wolves . // Yes , the gray wolf , the wolf of lore and gore , the wolf that pulls down moose in the Yukon , pounces on ptarmigan in the Siberian taiga , prowls for incautious goats at the edge of bedouin camps  --  Canis lupus is alive and well not twenty miles from the Piazza Campidoglio , where the bronze wolf-mother of Rome suckles Romulus and Remus through the centuries . // In the half century since World War II , there has been a prodigious flowering of education , industry , and prosperity in Italy  --  Il Boom , it is called . Italy is now one of the world 's great industrial powers . Among the Boom 's effects has been an exodus of Italians from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of that exodus has been reforestation of the land left behind . // Reforestation has made possible the recovery of remnant populations of the small roe deer , the large red deer ( a cousin of our North American elk ) , and the wild sheep known in French and Italian as mouflon . In a few high-mountain refuges there are growing populations of chamois and ibex . There have also been reintroductions  --  of native deer , exotic deer , mouflon  --  with varying success , depending on how extravagantly the local populace flouts the game laws . Wild boar , with their stupendous reproductive rate ( up to ten young per annual litter ) and their adaptation to a wide range of habitats , are flourishing . All these are good wolf prey , and more prey has meant more wolves . // New national parks and nature reserves have been designated . A contemporary map of Tuscany , to take just that region as an example , shows an extraordinary patchwork of protected areas  --  the Parco Naturale delle Alpi Apuane , coastal wetlands , great forests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizenry has insisted on enforcement of anti-poaching laws , especially in the more law-abiding north of Italy . Many younger Italians have taken up the banner of conservation . Habitat loss has also been slowed by the declining birth rate of the Italians , which is among the lowest in the world . // The contemporary wool and lamb industry is dominated by gigantic operations in New Zealand and Australia , where predators are largely nonexistent . Sheep production in Italy has been in decline since the Industrial Revolution began . More recently , the decline has been accelerated by the spread of universal mandatory education . In former times , the son of a Tuscan shepherd had little choice in life but to be a Tuscan shepherd . Today he may be a banker , a computer programmer , a builder of Fiats in Turin , a waiter in Beverly Hills . A Tuscan country girl is still likely to devote her adulthood to home and family , but she too will probably do so far from where she grew up . Only in the remotest pockets of Italy do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some places high in the Apennines , the far south . These are also , by no accident , often the places where wolves have persisted through the centuries . // The wolves of Italy are astonishingly adaptable , and their adaptability may be the direct result of human persecution . Centuries of trapping , poisoning , and gunning down have been tantamount to intense selective breeding . The wolves with the slightest inborn recklessness are quickly removed from the population , the survivors being wolves who can outwit their persecutors . Such non-natural selection may be why Italian wolves are smaller than their American or Russian cousins , less dependent on cooperative hunting , and much less picky about their diet . // I have seen photographs of Italian garbage-can raiders with their fierce mouths trailing strands of spaghetti . In the fourteenth century , wolves dug up the shallow graves of European plague victims . In the Middle East , wolves cower outside the towns , stoned by boys , with little more than the occasional outcast dog for a square meal . Wolves are survivors . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prey to feed only one wolf , one Italian wolf will live there alone . If there is only enough for two , two there will be , sending their young to find better work elsewhere  --  another old Italian tradition . Large packs are rare . Howling is rare . The modem Italian wolf can be as furtive , skulking , and cunning as the ancient wolf of legend . // There are wolves in Italy from the heel of the boot to the Alps . Some live in populations large enough to be self-sustaining . Many live in habitat sufficiently rich to support the traditional pack structure , in which an alpha male and alpha female preside over an extended family that hunts cooperatively , maintains an enduring territory , and howls in the night  --  but human killing keeps that luxurious style of life rare . // The wolves of Italy form what is known as a metapopulation , a population of populations . Simple size is a critical factor in the long-term survival of any population of living things , and a network of small populations can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interconnection is the key . // The Apennine mountain chain and other forest corridors have allowed the wolf populations of Italy to remain interconnected . The wolf 's reproductive rate is high , and young wolves forced out of their families with the arrival of new litters manage to find one another readily , probably owing to their extraordinary sense of smell and their habit of scent marking , mainly with urine , wherever they go . A wolf can breed at the age of two , and in Italy the typical litter size ranges from four to seven pups . A few subordinate , non-reproducing adults may be allowed to stay with the pack to help in the rearing of pups  --  and these may hope for a vacancy at the top of the pack hierarchy . Generally , though , there is a steady supply of dispersers leaving home every year to join other packs or form new ones . // Since 1976 , when legal protection began , the wolves of Italy have spread from a few mountain enclaves into a wide range of habitats . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them living on little more than garbage scavenged from village dumps . There are wolves in the mountain forests all along the Apennines , some of them hunters of game , some of them raiders of livestock . There are wolves in national parks , wolves on farms , wolves in suburbs . Although their most preferred habitat is remote forest , Italian wolves occur in habitats that make a mockery of the commonplace American presumption that the wolf is a creature only of the wilderness . Wolves have been seen , captured , or killed on the outskirts of Florence , Siena , Milan . From a low of perhaps a hundred in the early nineteen-seventies , the wolf population of Italy may now exceed five hundred individuals . Wolves overflowing out of Italy have even colonized the Provencal Alps of southeastern France . // One of Italy 's two largest centers of wolf population occurs in relatively lightly settled country  --  the central Apennines east of Rome , including the Abruzzo National Park . The other is in the heavily peopled landscape of Tuscany and the Emilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appearing and vanishing like will-o ' - the- wisps . Yet even where wolves are abundant in Italy , they can remain largely unknown . Ask a villager at the foot of a mountain where a wolf pack is living , and he may well stare at you in astonishment . Wolves ? Here ? No , signore . Tell a housewife picking out her fava beans and spring lamb in the Campo dei Fiori marketplace in Rome that she is standing within a half hour 's bus ride of wolf country , and she may indulge you with the condescending Roman smile reserved for bad children and idiots. // Extermination has been the lot of wolves in France , Germany , the Low Countries ' Switzerland , Scandinavia . Yet wolves have survived in Italy , Spain , Portugal , the Balkan states , and Greece . In western Europe there is a north-south gradient of doom . // Why ? // Luigi Boitani , of the University of Rome , is Europe 's leading wolf scientist , and also Edo Tedesco 's faculty adviser . Boitani has been studying wolves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , and he has found that wherever wolves occur , with the sole exception of a few Arctic islands devoid of human settlement , the principal determinant of wolf life or death is the behavior of the people living nearby . Boitani believes that that behavior is the product less of present necessity than of ancestral culture . // For many centuries before the nineteenth century , from the British Isles across to Russia , from Scandinavia down to France and Germany , most northern Europeans were nomadic herders . Resources were scarce in the cold north , and unevenly distributed . The herds had to keep moving . Human numbers were small , villages few . The distances the herds had to cover were so great that it was impossible for any herder to know the landscape in detail or to predict the movements of predators . Wolf attack could come anywhere , at any time . There was not much to be done but to kill every wolf you could . // By contrast , in the rich , warm south , herds could be maintained on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule . Here people have lived for centuries on small farms or in villages adjacent to grazing land  --  also almost always near rugged , densely forested mountains where wolves can take shelter . The flock grazes year after year in the same places , and the herder knows every spring , tree , and thicket . He knows where the wolves live : up there in the winter , down here come spring . // There are patterns , habits , stability . The people share their information . The wolves move across the upper meadow in the early summer evenings . The shepherd keeps his flock away from there . He gathers them close to the house at night . He listens for trouble in his sleep . If you come , Mr. Wolf , I will kill you . // And the wolf replies : I leave you those places at those times , for I can hunt elsewhere or at night . // Generations pass . The patterns hold . The understandings endure . In time there forms in both the wolf population and the human community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of their world and its rules , passed down from families to their young through time . // " One of the commonplace names in Italy is Passo del Lupo , " says Boitani  --  Wolf Pass . " A thousand years ago , the wolves crossed the road at this point . I can take you there today and you will see their tracks still . " So what has happened in Tuscany ? // " Disruption of the information lineage , " replies Boitani . " The Sardinian shepherds , who are new to Tuscany , and the wolves , who are also newcomers , do not understand one another . That is the critical factor in wolf survival in human habitat : mutual understanding . " // February 25 , 1994 // The yearling Fulvio lies dead beside the Via Cassia , run over by a car in the night . // March 20 , 1994 // Alvio , the radio-collared alpha male , suddenly goes off the air . The wolf team drives the entire province of Siena in their battered Land Rover , rotating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest points , morning , evening , night . Nothing . They fly back and forth over all of southern Tuscany . On Alvio 's frequency there is only silence . // The researchers follow wolf tracks , they howl , they scan the landscape through telescopes . Nothing . But the shepherds are still complaining of losses . The surviving members of the pack begin killing sheep in broad daylight , in full view of the shepherds . Edo Tedesco knows that if Alvio were still alive , he would keep them from taking such stupid risks . The alpha female is probably dead now too . // June 15 , 1994 // No ! She is alive , and so are two of the yearlings . Not only that , she has six new pups . The pack remains insanely visible . The wolf team watches them kill a roe deer . Several times they see wild boar face the pack down . They see the mother and the subadults regurgitating food for the pups. // July 31 , 1994 // The wolf team badly needs to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three weeks of attempted trapping go by in vain . The wolves continue killing sheep . The shepherds are enraged . They believe that the wolf team is not studying wolves but importing them ; they know that these kids are under the control of the archvillain Luigi Boitani , who is putting wolves all over Italy . One shepherd claims that the wolves killed two hundred of his sheep in one night . The research team is evicted from the house they have been renting , and nobody else in the area will rent to them . Their funding is not renewed . The Siena wolf project is over . // The blur of American time  --  from wolf-packed wilderness to strip mall in the blink of a Roman eye  --  tends to obscure the methodical deliberateness of the American wolf 's destruction . Control was never the object of the American crusade : only annihilation would do , first with simple atavistic fervor and ultimately by government fiat . It is surely no coincidence that the extermination of the wolf in the United States was carried out by descendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which an earlier American generation 's bounty hunter would greet the idea that the United States government would someday spend millions of dollars to restore the wolf to its ancestral range . Many old-timers in the American West today are dumbfounded by the largely urban sentiment in favor of the wolf 's return to Yellowstone // Once upon a time , the object of our identification was the placid grazer , the vegetarian victim , the sheep , the deer . Now , the savage predator , the carnivorous victor , Tyrannosaurus rex , the wolf , is our self projection  --  and this in a world in which meat eating ( by humans ) edges ever closer to the category of sin , a world in which the victim is otherwise . the image of our compassion and often of ourselves . // Could it be that our newfound love of the wolf is as irrational as our forebears ' hatred ? Could it be that the wolf wolf lovers love and the wolf haters hate are both falsehoods ? // Tuscany whispers to Yellowstone , " You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
