THE WAY THINGS ARE . <p> SHE WAS SITTING THERE IN THE LITTLE CAR with her hands on the steering wheel and the engine going and Jennifer stood outside with one foot on the running board . <p> " If you left anything , " Jennifer said , " I 'll send it to you . " <p> " I always do leave something , do n't I ? " she said . <p> " But if it 's that same goddamned brassiere with the crooked hook , I 'm going to burn it up this time . " <p> " You know you wo n't , " she said . <p> " Did you pack the presents for the children ? " <p> " Yes , the last thing . " <p> " And Rick 's ? " <p> " Sure , " she said , and they both laughed then , at the picture of Rick using his new present : the crazy heart shaped bar of spiced soap in the shower . And then they stopped laughing because it was not funny , really , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for them . <p> " Please stop over , Darling . Do n't try to do anything wild and make the whole trip in one day . " <p> " Well , maybe I will , " she said . <p> " I 'm so afraid you 'll fall asleep , driving . " <p> " I wo n't sleep , " she said . <p> " Well , " Jennifer said , taking her foot off the running board and standing back a step now so that the early morning sun hit her hair , making it red . " Well , Darling ... " <p> She started the car then , still looking at Jennifer and Jennifer could see her lips moving in the goodbye , but she could not hear her over the sound of the motor . Driving down the street now away from the house , as long as she could see anything , she could still see her sister in the rear view mirror , see Jennifer raising her right hand to brush the heavy hair back from her thin face . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jennifer sight and stopped the car , for the tears were there now , one hanging on each wide open eyelid , making the street wave in front of her . If she closed her eyes now , the two tears would fall and spot her dress , but if she kept her eyes wide open , kept on staring , the street would come back to her . <p> Then she closed them and let the two tears fall and more after and finally she put her head down on the steering wheel , still holding tight with her hands , crying now , really crying , for thinking of Jennifer . <p> For there was grey in Jennifer 's hair for the first time and that meant that Jennifer was getting old and if Jennifer was getting old , then she was , too . And the years were piling up and still they were living six hundred miles away from each other - they who had loved each other all their lives before anyone else , before friend or husband or child . <p> " I keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said , " but whenever I find anyone they either die or move away . " <p> It seemed so stupid to her that she , who loved Jennifer more than anyone else on earth , should let the years pull her on , should be meeting and parting and parting again from Jennifer . And while they were living on with miles between them , the years were slipping , one on top of the other , quietly , in measure . <p> Because of this she was not very excited to be going home to Rick and the children , though they would be terribly glad to have her back and though she came with presents , with Rick 's soap and the hundred piece model farm for the boy and the sewing set for little Jennifer . <p> It had been such a terrible mistake to name the child Jennifer , for she was going to look exactly like Rick and there was nothing , nothing at all , of the real Jennifer in her . So she had taken to calling her Janey now in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to be like Rick . <p> Oh , it was absurd that they should be going about the streets of separate towns , she and Jennifer , being taken for responsible young matrons , that they should have houses of their own to keep and care if the chickens were fat or lean and lie with strangers in strange beds . <p> And she thought of the big old bed at home in the room that she and Jennifer had always had together and of how , when Jennifer , being the older , had started to go with boys she would lie awake waiting for her and give her the warm place in the bed . She could feel again how delicious it was to be rolling onto the cold side , having Jennifer so pleased she had stayed awake , putting her warm feet on Jennifer 's cold ones . Jennifer 's feet were always cold . <p> She could smell the sheets again that had been dried out of doors and see the blue curtains blowing into the room . And she could see the wallpaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design , yet having come by this time to be almost beautiful , almost the very essence of safety . <p> " Is n't it awful ? " Jennifer had said this time , " I do n't have a single thing from the house , do you ? " <p> " No , not a thing , " she had said , " but if you could have something now , what would you take ? " <p> " Oh , I do n't know . Something of yours , I think , or something we used together . Maybe the foot-stool . " <p> " I 'd take Laughing Boy . " <p> " Oh , God ! " Jennifer said , " I had almost forgot about him . Why do you suppose we never got ourselves a proper ashtray ? " <p> " It was because we always had our money spent a week ahead , if you remember . " <p> She wished now that she could find Laughing Boy again and send him to Jennifer , but he would be gone now , surely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had forgotten now which relative had left him there ( or had he been a souvenir of the fair ? ) , this huge iron ash tray , holding on one edge , as a kind of handle , a hideous little iron Pierrot playing a guitar . <p> They had called him the little man with the big guitar and the animated handle , but finally they had settled on Laughing Boy and she had seen him once so that she would never forget him . That was the day Jennifer had gone , staring at Laughing Boy until suddenly she had seen him in all of his hideous ironness , standing up to his knees in cigarette butts , playing his guitar and smiling , smiling . <p> And she knew now as she wiped her eyes with the black of her hand and started the car going that she was tired clear through , that she had been tired for years . <p> As she drove into the filling station the prospect of driving six hundred miles on the highway , hearing Jennifer 's words and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she said to the attendant : " Is n't there some other way to get to Reading besides Number 24 ? " <p> " Well , yes Ma'am , " he said , " there is , but the roads are n't first rate and it 's a couple of hours longer . " <p> " Well , here , " she said , taking out her maps , " show me how to go . " For a change of scenery , a different set of billboards , even a bad road , would help . Anything , anything at all that would demand attention , that would keep the surface thinking until she got there . <p> " Well , " he said , " this is the way you go , but if I was you , Lady , I 'd stick to the highway . " <p> If you was me , she thought , you 'd scream . <p> " It looks a little bit like rain , " he said , " and part of them roads is dirt . " <p> " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't care . " She liked the rain , though Jennifer never had . <p> She had gone almost two hundred miles before she ran into it though , and she was glad to see it , even though she was by that time on the dirt road , for it made her feel better , less tired , more aware . <p> But neither she nor the attendant had reckoned on a cloudburst , and very soon it became no longer a diversion , but a serious and essential matter to get to a shelter . <p> Though it was only noon , it was night dark out and she was almost hysterically thankful to see lights of the little town burning ahead and feel the wheels grip the pavement of its main street . <p> She had not eaten since she had left Jennifer that morning and then she had only had coffee and so when she saw the hotel sign ahead with the globes of the H gone dark , she stopped and went in to lunch . It was dark in the dining room even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only person there . The food was not very good and after she had finished lunch she went out into the lobby and stood watching the storm . <p> " How soon do you think I 'll be able to go on ? " she asked the proprietor who also stood by the window watching . <p> " Oh , you would n't get two miles in this , Miss , " he said . " This is the worst one I 've seen for years . You 'd best stop the night anyway . " <p> " I suppose there is nothing else to do , " she said . " Would you get my things out of the car for me ? " <p> It was a very old hotel and her room rather pleased her . Lying on the bed looking up at the high ceiling , she felt quite good now , almost as though she had found a day , for Rick was not expecting her until tomorrow and there was nothing she had to do and no one she had to see . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she unpacked her bags , taking out first the presents for the children which she had put in last : the model farm ( one hundred pieces ) and the sewing set . Then she took a nap . When she awoke someone was knocking on the door and first thing she heard was the howling of the storm outside , really violent now , really menacing . She opened the door on the proprietor whom she had seen that afternoon . <p> " Mrs. Curtess , " he said , " the cook would like to know what time you want dinner . " <p> " It does n't matter , " she said . " What time do you serve ? " <p> " Well , Mr. Frazier eats at six , " he said , " and the cook thought , if you do n't mind , since you two are the only guests in the hotel , if you 'd eat when Mr. Frazier does ... " <p> " Of course , " she said . " You do n't want to stay up all night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Mrs. Curtess . You see , it 's such a bad night that we 're not likely to have any trade at all from the town and the cook would like to try to get home tonight if he can make it . " <p> " That 's all right , " she said . " What time is it now ? " <p> " It 's five . " <p> " That 's plenty of time . " <p> " And the cook would like to know , if there 's something in particular you 'd want to eat . He could be preparing it now , you see . " <p> " Oh , I 'm very agreeable , " she said . " I 'll just have whatever Mr. Frazier has . " <p> While she was dressing she recaptured the feeling that he had first given her . She thought of what a fine letter she would write to Jennifer about Mr. Frazier . She knew quite what he would be like : a little fat man , very annoyed at being delayed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have his dinner at six o'clock sharp . She only hoped that he did n't have a taste for liver and onions . <p> Mr. Frazier would probably have a cigar after dinner and grow chatty about business , so it would be best to take something to read with her , but she had no books , so at six she picked up her cigarette case and stuffed the directions to Janey 's sewing set in her bag . If Mr. Frazier were like she thought he 'd be the sewing directions would be an improvement over his conversation . <p> She arrived very punctually in the dining room ( not for the world would she have kept Mr. Frazier waiting ) , walked clear through to the end of the room and sat down . Mr. Frazier was late . <p> She drank two glasses of ice water while she was waiting and when she heard his footsteps she looked down at the table , lest she in the slightest way encourage him to sit with her . She could hear him walking now clear through the room as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table next to her she looked up . <p> And there was between them an almost instant spark of recognition , though neither one of them ever realized why and possibly only Jennifer could have told them had she been there that though in all their others features they were dissimilar , their eyes were exactly alike . <p> It is amazing that though people have only two eyes and these even had to be placed in a rather limited space , yet almost none of them have eyes alike except for an occasional father and son . The expression , also , was almost identical , though in the man it was more pronounced , a look of profound , but dispassionate , realism . <p> " Good evening , " he said to her <p> " Good evening , " she said , wondering if there could have arrived in the last hour still a third guest . Surely this man , this could not be her little Mr. Frazier , whom she had known so intimately , so well , between five and six . <p> They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ate in silence . Once he said " coffee " to the waitress and she repeated it after him . <p> They both lit cigarettes at the same time and , looking up the first exhalation , they saw each other and both of them would have spoken then but that the woman suddenly looked down at her lap and began to fumble at her handbag . Her hands were shaking now , violently , and when she felt the little folder of sewing directions she clutched on it in desperation and began to read to herself : Lay the pattern on the cloth and pin it down so that it will not slip . Then cut the cloth around the pattern and cut from A to B , being sure to follow all the notches . <p> She could not go on reading it forever and finally she took a drink of water and looked up again . He was sitting just as she had left him and there was a moment there when they were looking at each other and no turning away now and then the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cook she could still see the after image of his eyes upon the dark . It was so still that they could hear each other breathing and finally he said , <p> " Just because we ca n't see is no reason why we ca n't talk , I suppose . " <p> " No , " she said , " no reason . " <p> " Any minute , now , " he said , " some fool is going to come in here and tell us that the lights are out . It never fails . " <p> She laughed then , easily and gladly , and her hands were no longer shaking . <p> " You do n't look like some one who has to have his dinner at six , " he said . <p> " Neither do you . " <p> " What did you say ? " <p> " I said , " neither do you . " <p> " Well , I 'm not , " he said . " What made you think I was ? " <p> " The proprietor told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Frazier eats at six . ' " <p> " And the cook thought , " Mr. Frazier went on , " if you do n't mind , since you two are the only guests in the hotel , if you 'd eat when Mrs. Curtess does ... " <p> " Did he tell you that , too ? " <p> " Oh , that lying bastard , " he said . " Are you responsible for the omelette ? " <p> " No , are you ? " <p> " I simply said what 's good enough for Mrs. Curtess is good enough for me . ' " <p> " Oh , " she said , " how easily we fell into it . What do you think we 'd have got if we 'd asked for squab ? " <p> " We 'd have got omelette , " he said . " That omelette was ordained years ago . " <p> The proprietor came in then carrying a dusty and wavering lamp . " All over the place , " he said . " It 's not just here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say the river 's rising a foot an hour . " The proprietor stood there holding the lamp in his hands not knowing which table to put it on . Frazier got up and walked over to her table and the proprietor , much relieved , set down the lamp . <p> " I will have a light put in your rooms , " he said , " and when you are ready to go you can take this one with you . " <p> " Thank you , " the woman said . <p> The proprietor stood there , a little tentative in his manner and quite excited still about the drama of the storm . " Well , " he said . " Well , I 'm sorry about the light . " <p> " I 'm not , " Frazier said , when he had gone . " Are you ? " <p> " No , " she said , " no . " <p> " And what are you doing in Milton , Mrs. Curtess ? " <p> " I was on my way to Reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid the highway ; I was trying to find a new way . And you ? " <p> " You 'll never believe it , " he said , " but I came here on purpose . It seemed a good place to think because I do n't know anyone here . " <p> " And what are you thinking about ? " <p> " I am thinking about not going home . " <p> " NOT going ? " <p> " Yes , not going . I am trying to talk myself out of it . " <p> " I have just been to see my sister , " she said , " and all day I have been wallowing in the most horrible nostalgia . " <p> " Nostalgia ? " he said . " Christ , do n't I know it ? " <p> " Then why do n't you go ? " <p> " Because I just made a thousand dollars . " <p> " I should think that would be a very good reason to go , " she said . <p> " Oh , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall have to give away the thousand dollars because they need it very badly and I will not be able to look at it . " <p> " Well ? " she asked . <p> " Well , " he said , " if I give away the thousand , I shall have to go back to work and if I have to go back to work I can not go to Africa and if I can not go to Africa I can not paint the great yellow lions and if I can not paint the great yellow lions lying in the fat sleek green vegetation again this year , I think that I shall die . " <p> " Are you going to live a year on a thousand dollars ? " <p> " Yes , " he said . <p> " How ? " <p> " Why , last year I lived on eight hundred . That is , I think I did , but I was afraid to count it . " And she knew it would be better not to say anything , anything at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see your sister ? " he said . " And what is her name ? " <p> " Jennifer . " <p> " Jennifer ? And is she beautiful ? " <p> " Oh , yes , " she said . " Jennifer is very beautiful . " <p> " And what do you do , " he said , " when you go to see Jennifer ? " <p> " Well , we laugh , mostly , and talk and sometimes we giggle . " <p> " And what do you laugh about ? " he said . <p> " I do n't know . As soon as I leave her I can never remember because they 're not jokes , you know . They 're just our things , our language . " <p> " And are you never sad , " he said , " with Jennifer ? " <p> " Before we have babies , we are , " she said . " Jennifer always comes to me and I always go to Jennifer and we say Of course nothing is going to happen . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melodramatic , but really , if I should die this time , would you take care of my child ? Would you bring him up ? ' and we always promise and we never die . " <p> " How many children does Jennifer have ? " he said . <p> " Two . " <p> " And you ? " <p> " Two . " And she hated for him to know as he surely must that she was older than he . <p> " I do n't have any , " he said . <p> " Yes , I know , but perhaps you will in Africa . " <p> " Do you really think I can get to Africa ? " <p> " Yes , " she said , " yes , I know you will . " <p> They sat there not speaking then , looking at each other across the yellow wavering lamp and she kept hearing idiotically over and over the sentence from the sewing instructions : Lay the pattern on the cloth and pin it down so that it will not slip . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Not if you believe I can get to Africa . " <p> " My name is Penny , Mr. Frazier . " <p> " Penny ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Mine 's John , " he said . And they were silent again , seeing each other 's faces change from yellow in the lamp light to green in the lightning . <p> " Are you afraid of the storm , Penny ? " <p> " No , " she said . " I should love to go out in it . " <p> " All right . " <p> They got up then from the table and walked the length of the dining room , together now , and went out into the storm , not stopping for wraps , never believing it could be as fierce as it was , but they had not gone more than six steps before Penny was blown right down hard on the pavement . <p> And there in the storm John knelt beside her , frantically calling the name he had only just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was unconscious and he picked her up in his arms and went stumbling into the hotel and up the stairs in the dark , somehow not falling . And he could have kissed the proprietor for the light burning in his room . <p> Penny moaned a little when he put the wet towel on her head and then she opened her eyes . <p> " That 's a real storm , " she said . <p> " You 've cut your head , Penny girl . It 's bleeding . Should I get you a doctor ? " " Get me the mirror , first , " she said , and , when she had seen the cut , " It 's not very bad , John . " <p> " It will be black by morning , I 'll bet you . " <p> " Well , " she said , " then let it . " <p> " Penny , " he said , " Penny , you scared the hell out of me . " <p> " I 'm cold , John . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took off her clothes , very deftly , very easily , so that there was no question about it between them and then he rubbed her skin all over with a towel until she was warm and then he wrapped her up in a blanket . <p> At dawn when she woke up John was holding her on his lap , sitting in the big chair by the window , but almost before she remembered where she was she knew that it was still raining . <p> " How 's your head ? " he said . <p> " It 's all right . Have you been sitting up all night ? " <p> " Yes , " he said . " The storm was wonderful in the night . It was green . " <p> " Are you tired ? " <p> " No , " he said , " no . I feel fine . " <p> " So do I. " <p> When they went downstairs to breakfast , she stopped at the desk . <p> " Is there any way I can send a telegram ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I 'm sorry . All the wires are down . Where did you want to send it ? " <p> " To Reading . " <p> " Oh , " he said , " south ? Well , maybe by tomorrow we might be able to get one through . It 's west where the wreckage is the worst . " <p> " Oh , " she said . " I suppose the roads are impossible , too ? " <p> " Completely , " he said . " All the bridges are out and the trains have stopped even . The river 's over its banks , now . It will be right in here by night if it does n't stop raining . " <p> " In the hotel ? " <p> " Yes , Ma'am , " he said . " This is a real flood . " And he seemed very proud of it . <p> Rick will not start to worry until tonight , she thought . <p> After breakfast they went to their rooms , but all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swelling river she knew that he would come , though she started when he knocked . <p> " You can see the river from my window , " she said . <p> " Do you really think it will come into the hotel ? " he said . <p> " You mean Otel ? " <p> " Those lights have been out on the H ever since I got here . " <p> " How long have you been here ? " she said . <p> " Two weeks . " <p> " And when does your boat leave ? " <p> " In a week . " <p> " You 'll make it , " she said , and she was thinking that a week is only seven days , but that if they did n't sleep at all , it would be like fourteen and she knew she must stay even though the roads should be safe , even though she could get a telegram through to Rick . <p> " Is that west ? " she asked . <p> " Yes , " he said , " where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst . " <p> " Yes , " she said , " I know . But you 're going East . You 'll make it . " <p> But all the time it was there , the question between them , and there was nothing else , really , to talk about . <p> And it was good for her to be shaken so profoundly , as nothing had ever shaken her before , nothing . This was not friendly like meeting Rick , nor sorrowful like leaving Jennifer . This was like nothing that had ever happened to her before . <p> And she was glad , glad of it . <p> And they both of them knew it , but they were afraid of the daylight and of the proprietor 's coming to ask what they wanted for lunch and of a sudden flood warning and they were waiting , waiting for the night now and it would be hours yet . <p> " What shall we do all day ? " he said . " We ca n't go out . " For he knew it was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the night . <p> " Well , here , " she said , and she handed him the boy 's present , the model farm , and she was surprised to find no guilt in herself and chilled to know that she was capable of giving him the child as well . <p> He opened the box and the red cows and the sheep and the pieces of the farm building were all lying scrambled together . <p> " How wonderful you are , " he said , " to be carrying things like this around with you . " <p> " There are a hundred pieces , " she said . " That ought to last us a long time . " <p> They sat on the floor , piecing together the cylindrical silo and the windmill that really turned . They put the cows to pasture and had a sheep shearing and the horses would have none of their plow , but stood all day lolling at the water trough . <p> And John carved a man and a woman from the bar of soap in the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red barn . <p> And now there were a hundred and two pieces . <p> Towards evening they put all the cattle where they thought they ought to be for the night and they shut the barn door and the soap man and woman went into the house . Then Penny combed her hair and they went down to dinner . <p> But the lobby was a foot deep in water and all the food in the hotel had been taken in a boat to the flood refugees . <p> So there was no need to wait any more and they turned and ran up the stairs , the woman a little ahead , and as soon as they were inside her room they locked the door and , holding each other , they leaned against it , so glad now to have the day over with , the waiting done , and John lifted her into his arms and carried her over to the bed and she could hear the wind rising in the trees like a siren . <p> Awake in the night she sat up in bed smoking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see his fragile knees with the bones so near the skin , so bare to the wind . And seeing them , she remembered El Greco 's Pieta and she wondered how El Greco could have known how it is so long to hold a grown man across your legs , not cradling him , not loving him even , just holding him there with the knees spread apart , being heavy where he is light , protected where he is fragile . And she could remember in the picture that Mary was not only looking at Jesus , but out , our into a world where he was not any more . And she remembered , too , how Frieda Lawrence had held D.H . ' s feet in her hands while he was dying and it did not seem silly to her any more the way it had when she had first read it . <p> In the morning they went first to the window and they said together it is still raining and they were glad , even though they knew that some people would be drowning now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in other houses the mud and the ooze would be crawling into the kitchen stoves and into the drawers where the linens were . <p> And she did not even try to get a telegram through . <p> " Have you got another toy for today , Penny ? " <p> " Yes , " she said , " but you wo n't like it . " <p> " Let me see . " And so she got out Janie 's sewing set and there were patterns for every kind of doll dress , with the underwear to match , and there were pieces of cloth : dimity and organdy , satin and crepe , thin and heavy , smooth and rough . There was everything there that a doll would need but shoes . <p> " Here , " she said . " Here 's the directions . " He took them from her and began to read : Lay the pattern on the cloth and pin it down so that it will not slip . " God , " he said , " how deadly dull , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll design you a wardrobe , " he said , and he got a pencil and began to sketch the doll dresses on the hotel stationery . <p> " I want her to have a morning dress , " Penny said , " to wear in the rose garden . " <p> " All right , " he said , " which cloth do you use for that ? " And Penny began to sort through them until she found a thin white organdy with a tiny flower all through it . " This one , " she said , and she lifted it from the pile and handed it to him . <p> " Penny , " he said , " take off your ring . Please . " <p> She took it from her finger then , easily , and started across the room with it , but there was no place in the room big enough to hold it ( can you put a wedding ring in an eye cup ? ) and finally she took it in the closet and hung it on a hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day he would cut the cloth for her and she sat in the big chair sewing , hurriedly now , not even stopping to smoke , as though the doll would be dead if she did n't have her clothes by nightfall . <p> And at nightfall he took the needle from her fingers and took off the little thimble and they clung to each other and she was crying now . It seemed right to him that one of them should be crying and so he did not try to stop her . <p> This night they did not even go downstairs and so they did not know that the water was receding a little in the lobby . <p> The smell of the river had begun now to permeate everything in the room so that the sheets and the towels and even their skins were so full of it that there was nothing divorced from it , nothing now but what was heavy and floating and destructive . When the rain stopped in the night it woke them with its sudden demanding stillness . <p> Early in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , not caring any more who should see them together . <p> " Mrs. Curtess , " the man said , " I think you can get a wire through now to the South .

Would you like to have breakfast in your room ? " <p> " Yes , " she said . <p> And then she went back to John . " You can get your train at noon , " she said , " and you 'll be in time for the boat . You have to allow for its not getting through , you know . " <p> And he did not say that he would n't go . They were thinking it , but they did not say it . They had not said any words .

But before she gave it to him she cut the cord off it because she could not bear to see him sitting there in the antiquated tub with the soap heart hanging around his neck . <p> And at the station they said the train would really leave at noon , but she did not believe it was safe and the agent kept trying to reassure her . <p> " But it 's all right EAST , " he said .

" he said . <p> " I 'm going back to our room , " she said . " I 'm going to lay out the doll dresses in order with the panties to match and put all the animals out on the bed and leave them there , all hundred pieces . " <p> " It 's a hundred and two , " he said . <p> " That 's right , " she said . " The man and the woman now . " <p> And she turned and left him because it was not the kind of love that had to do with kissing in a rail-road station . There had never , for a moment , been any comfort in it for them . <p> In the room , she laid out all the dresses in a row across the pillows according to the time of day they were to be worn , laid them out with order . And on the bed she set up the stock farm and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she could not put the man and the woman back in the hay loft , now that it had stopped raining . <p> It was not a floating soap that they were made of , so it was easy to drown them in the horse trough because they were so small , to drown them in the water that was no longer safe for drinking . <p> And then she put on her coat and walked down the stairs and out of the hotel and she began walking slowly and with difficulty through the mud of the west road . <p> She was very alert , now , very attentive to the record of the flood . She saw the world lying at an angle , quiet from its outrage , saw the intimate still lives of domesticity exposed to the open air . She saw a live yellow hen sitting in doubt beside an horizontal can of baking powder and a douche bag full of mud . She was walking on the west road now and she knew it . <p> It was not that she was confused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what direction she was going . She knew that she was going away from the three of them . She knew that she was not going east after John and his yellow lions , the yellow lions lying in the fat sleek green vegetation . <p> She knew she was not going east , or north to Jennifer , or south to Rick . <p> But west , where , as they had all insisted on telling her , the worst of the wreckage lay . <p> Illustration ( Mary and Elizabeth , 1928 , Kathe Kollwitz ) <p>
