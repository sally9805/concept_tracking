Somewhere out there is a team that 's good and knows it 's good , even though no one else does . It has been downgraded by the forecasting geniuses , including yours truly , and is licking its chops , waiting for the bell . You 'll see . // That team will come through with a season-opening upset , and at the end of the year , when it 's in the playoffs , the club will look back on that first game as the one that defined its season . And the football world will say , " How come we did n't see that coming ? " // The Buccaneers had a game like that last year , stunning the 49ers in their opener . And the low-rated Giants beat the favored Eagles on their way to the NFC East title . Oh , yes , the upsets in Week 1 are out there , just waiting to happen . The trick is to find them . // So let 's begin our first round of forecasts with the surprises . The Oilers over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten their act together with Neil O'Donnell running the offense , but Tennessee might be one of the sleepers of ' 98 . I like the Oilers ' pounding style against a zone-blitz defense that still has to show that it knows what it 's doing . // Look for the Bucs , another road team , to upset the Vikings , who are dazzling people with all their firepower . Tampa Bay is coming off a blah preseason , and Trent Dilfer has struggled , but that just makes me like the Bucs even more . They 're loading up for the real thing instead of trying to impress a new owner  --  as the Vikings were . Besides , Tampa Bay seems to play well at the Metrodome. // I 'm leaning toward a third upset , but my heart is n't in it : the Bills over the Chargers . The Chargers averaged 32.3 points a game in the preseason , and this will be a coming-out party for quarterback Ryan Leaf , and the crowd will be loud  --  well , as loud as Southern Californians can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't thrill you in any department but have a blue-collar soundness . Call this an emotional pick , which means the brain is on a 30-minute lunch break . // Arizona to upset Dallas is a most enticing proposition , with the Cowboys going through their usual off-field histrionics . And you have to figure Jake Plummer will work his magic against a Dallas defense that ca n't find a pass rush . But the flip side is that Arizona does n't have much of an offensive line , and the Cardinals have n't won in Dallas since 1989 . So I 'll stick with the Cowboys . // Seahawks over the Eagles in Philly . It 's not that I 'm so wild about the Seahawks , a team some people consider an emerging nation . It 's just that the Eagles  --  with their fine right cornerback , Bobby Taylor , out , and their keynote runner , Charlie Garner , nursing a sprained ankle  --  will have an even tougher time than people realize . I think Seattle will put a lot of points on the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denver ? I remember it like it was yesterday , Pats 20-17 , in 1968 , behind the magic arm of Mike Taliaferro and the great hands of Jim Whalen and the ferocious pass rush of Larry Eisenhauer and Earthquake Hunt and Houston Antwine . I 'm getting excited just thinking about the Monday-night opener . You still like Denver ? O.K. , I think the Broncos will win too , but it wo n't be a picnic this time , because their great offensive line , which was the platform of their Super Bowl success , is in disarray . And when aroused , Pete Carroll 's defense can put on a spirited show . Bet you even up that Terrell Davis does n't get his hundred yards . // Finally , here 's my blowout of the week : Jaguars over the Bears in Chicago . Nothing I saw in the preseason caused me to come off my pick of Jacksonville as the Super Bowl champ or the Bears as dismal . Curtis Enis , Chicago 's top draft pick , showed power and a real burst in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaguars will be loading up to stop ?
