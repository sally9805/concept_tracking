Spring training is on right now , and next month the Arizona Diamondbacks move into their radical new ballpark Photograph Cactus League ballparks put you close to the action in Phoenix and Tucson . // Baseball has long had a fickle relationship with Arizona . Like all those snowbirds from Toronto , Minneapolis , and Chicago , each spring the game heads south to take advantage of the state at its best time of year . Players train for a couple of weeks , exhibition games are played for a few more , and then , just as the desert is about to turn hot and nasty , the show moves on . Well , with the arrival of the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks , baseball has finally decided to stay down here for good . And not unlike a lot of Arizona transplants , it 's moving into a brand-new home with a big lawn , lots of airconditioning , and even a pool . That new home is in downtown Phoenix at the $354-million Bank One Ballpark . Call it BOB for short . Designed by Ellerbe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big ole cuss . It dwarfs neighboring America West Arena , the hockey and basketball facility that has already helped spur a revival in this part of town . With its retractable roof , BOB is an imposing structure . And in the wake of retro , born-with-a-patina charmers like Denver 's Coors Field and Baltimore 's Camden Yards , it at first seems a little baffling , perhaps a missed opportunity on a par with the disappointing new Comiskey Park in Chicago . From the outside there 's not a whole lot that says baseball . BOB does n't have the diamond lines of traditional baseball-only structures , or even the recognizable doughnut shape of the now-lamented 1970s multiuse stadiums in Cincinnati and Pittsburgh . BOB is hangarlike , looking more like a soundstage on hormones than anything that might so quaintly be described as a ballpark . But like artichokes , lobsters , and nopales , the good stuff is inside . Think of BOB as the baseball version of a Faberge egg . Set inside that big rectangle is an intimate baseball diamond seating 48,500 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first nonartificial turf in a covered stadium . Houston 's once-translucent Astrodome tried grass when it opened in 1965 . But players fielding high flies and pop-ups kept losing the ball in the glare . Eventually a coat of acrylic was applied to the dome , which helped the ballplayers but killed the grass , thus paving the way for that affront to nature , AstroTurf . BOB 's shade-tolerant grass is a hybrid developed by researchers at the University of California at Riverside and grown out in California 's Palm Desert . The challenge at the ballpark will be to figure out how to get the grass enough sunlight without frying the fansPhoenix 's average July temperature is a toasty 94 deg . The seats themselves are canted toward home plate to ensure good sight lines , and 80 percent of the stands are located inside the foul poles , including 69 luxury boxes . But the section that will likely earn BOB the greatest buzz is a small area in the right center-field power alley . This section takes one step further the shower that baseball maverick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park : the ballpark has its own swimming pool , meaning that you can bob at the BOB . The Sun Pool Party Pavilion will be available for singlegame lease , and can accommodate as many as 45 fans , who may just end up with the most unique vantage point in all of baseball . Professional baseball in Arizona goes back only to the late 1920s , but the sport 's presence in the state is almost 125 years old . The first game took place in Yuma , which later became a springtraining town . And in 1929 , the Detroit Tigers became the first major-league team to hold all of its spring training in Arizona . But it was n't until 1947 , when Bill Veeck brought the Cleveland Indians here , that the foundation for the Cactus League was laid . He moved the team to avoid segregationist policies in Florida after the Indians signed Larry Doby , the first African-American player in the American League . Veeck then persuaded the New York Giants to come down to Arizona so the Indians would have some competition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insiders , spring training has become a big business . Local communities have built major new facilities for visiting teams , and low-key , old-style ball fields like Scottsdale Stadium and Mesa 's HoHoKam Park have been replaced by shiny ballparks that try to blend modernity with tradition . You can change the stage , but spring training is still all about dreams found and lost . Take this Cubs fan 's experience at a Cubs-Brewers spring-training game last season . Fargo-style upper-Midwestern accents and the nasal vowels of Chicago 's North Side were honking all around the stands , as if a flock of stuffed-up geese had landed for the day in Mesa . Although neither team has enjoyed much success in recent years ( the last time the Cubbies were in the World Series , they still held spring training on Catalina Island ) , there was an excitement in seeing the 1997 lineup for the first time , especially with ace Steve Trachsel on the mound . The optimism lasted for less than an inning . Trachsel hit the first batter , gave up a double to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third , and then , for good measure , hit the cleanup batter . Even though the Cubs came back to win the game , to this fan 's experienced eyes , the 1997 die was cast . Sure enough , the Cubs , outdoing their own unique legacy of futility , went on to set a record for the worst start ever in the National League , a mere 120 years of history . And at Wrigley Field , there 's no swimming pool for drowning sorrows . Photograph Scottsdale Stadium is home to the San Francisco Giants .
