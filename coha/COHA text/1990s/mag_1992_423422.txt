<p> You have just been found guilty of a non-violent felony and sentenced to a two-to-four year term in the New York State prison system . Shortly thereafter , you find yourself in one of the state 's reception centers listening to a corrections employee inform you about the Shock Incarceration Program . <p> You are told that successful completion of this new program could help you earn release to parole prior to completion of your minimum sentence . in addition , you will receive the tools , counseling , and discipline necessary to help keep you from becoming a repeat offender or " career criminal . " <p> With nothing to lose and everything to gain you say , " Why not ! " <p> Legislation was passed in July of 1987 establishing New York 's Shock Incarceration Program . The purpose was to reduce the demand for bed space , and to treat and release specially selected state prisoners earlier than their court mandated periods of incarceration while safeguarding the community protection rights of the citizenry . Shock Incarceration is a six-month voluntary program for eligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alternative form of incarceration stressing a highly structured and regimented routine . It includes extensive discipline , physical labor , exercise and intensive drug and substance abuse rehabilitation . Inmates receive an opportunity to develop socially acceptable tools to succeed , including academics , drug treatment and work ethics . Daily routines include physical training , military style drills , calisthenics and running . Dormitories are cleaned daily , beds are made in a military style and personal hygiene is a priority . One full day and two evenings each week are devoted to education , including high school equivalency courses , remedial education and other academics . Alcohol and substance abuse treatment , counseling and pre-release programs are mandatory courses taken each of the additional evenings . <p> Inmates perform community service projects in neighboring towns and villages . They complete services for DEC , non-profit organizations and local governments working on construction and maintenance projects . Upon successful completion of the program , each inmate 's case is reviewed by the board of parole to determine the inmates readiness for release . Graduates participate in an After Shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as work release programs . <p> Presently , New York State operates the largest Shock Incarceration Program in the United States with an annual capacity of 3,000 individuals , including 150 beds for female participants in each six-month phase . <p> The following facilities have been designated incarceration facilities by Thomas A. Coughlin , Ill , Commissioner for the Department of Correctional Services : TABLE <p> The DOCS and DEC have an agreement where camp crews are assigned to accomplish projects on DEC lands . Eight other correctional facilities also have inmate crew which work on DEC projects in New York . DEC has 36 personnel supervising a work force of 575 inmates on a daily basis to accomplish these projects . <p> Moriah Shock <p> Moriah Shock , which is located in the Town of Moriah and in the Hamlet of Mineville , Essex County , is one such facility . A staff of five DEC employees supervises five to seven inmate crews on DEC projects . Much of the work is located in the Adirondack Forest Preserve . Because of the park 's regulations and restrictions on the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force which is of tremendous value in accomplishing many labor intensive projects . <p> During the spring and fall , inmate crews perform the seasonal opening and closing of nine area state campgrounds , seven state boat launch sites and numerous fishing access sites . Crews rake , sweep , paint , clean culverts and ditches , cut hazardous tees and perform other manual labor needed in the maintenance of the area state facilities . During the camping season , most of the workers retreat to some of the lesser known parts of the Adirondack Park , where only an avid outdoorsman might find them toiling away with their primitive hand tools . <p> Interior And Trail Work <p> Unit management plans for the Hammond Pond Wild Forest Area called for the construction of a trail system , an expanded parking lot , and one Adirondack lean-to . Due to the heavily scheduled work load for the state trail crew assigned to the area , the project was given to the Moriah Shock crews in the summer of 1989 . Most of the work was completed by the fall of 1991 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new trails , two new bridges , an expanded parking lot and a newly constructed state lean-to . One has to hike the area to really appreciate the work these crews have accomplished . Many of the rocks moved by these men have literally taken hours , and in some cases , even days . The rocks were placed strategically in the many water bars , stairways and bridge foundations found along these trails . <p> Cedar logs for the lean-to at Moose Mountain Pond were harvested from a selective tree cut in Wickham Marsh Wildlife Management Area . The logs were cut with hand saws and carried out over one-half mile by inmates to a spot where they were trucked to the Crown Point Maintenance Center . Here the logs were constructed into an Adirondack lean-to by another inmate crew supervised by DEC staff . The lean-to was then marked , disassembled and shipped to the parking lot for Moose Mountain Pond . From here , the lean-to was hand carried , log by log , up the 3.2 miles of trail to Moose Mountain Pond . It was moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finishing this project , especially since most of the men were from the streets of New York City and had no idea of what an Adirondack lean-to looked like or where Moose Mountain Pond was located . <p> Wildlife Management Areas <p> Work in the four wildlife management areas mainly consists of maintaining the 11 miles of access roads and foot trails , as well as cutting brush along the 20 miles of boundary lines . Duck nesting berms are seasonally mowed and wood duck boxes , blue bird houses and rabbit hutches are installed . Future work plans include creating new access trails , scenic outlooks and new foot bridges . To improve the habitat in these areas selective tree cuts have been undertaken . Some logs are harvested and sent to a state saw mill where they are milled to be used on state projects at a later date . Money made from sales of firewood which is harvested by inmates is placed into the Conservation Fund . One can almost picture how the pyramids were built after watching a shock crew carry 24-inch diameter , 16-foot long logs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tandem dump truck by sheer manpower . <p> Fisheries <p> In 1989 , a joint venture with the Pharoah Mountain Sportsmen 's Alliance and the New York State fisheries unit began to rebuild a fish weir . This project consisted of rebuilding the road to the Schroon River Fish Weir and the reconstruction of the fish weir which was built in the early 1900 's . Two weeks were spent using hand tools in cutting trees , brush and digging stumps from the abandoned roadway so that trucks could transport materials to the weir site . From here the remains of the old weir had to be removed so the that the new crib work could be started . By the fall of 1989 more than half of the structure was completed with more than 150 tons of stone filling the new cribs . The main structure was finished in the summer of 1990 with 350 tons of stone work in the new structure . All the stone for this structure was carried down the bank and across the river in five gallon pails by the Shock crews . The weir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fisheries unit will then be able to harvest eggs and keep a watchful eye on the spawning of trout and salmon in the Schroon River . <p> In 1991 Shock crews assisted the Pharoah Mountain Sportsmen 's Alliance again by cleaning debris from the lower section of two tributaries to Schroon Lake . After the debris was removed from the brooks , the brook beds and banks were covered with 50 tons of #4 stone to improve the smelt propagation in these brooks . <p> Annually , the Shock crews assist the fisheries unit in planting 20,000 willow trees along the Boquet River in an attempt to curb erosion problems along this river . <p> Forest Fire Control <p> In 1991 , Moriah Shock crews worked on three forest fires in which 75 acres of forest land was burned . in one case , equipment was carried two miles to fight the fire . inmates helped to construct fire lines in an effort to contain the fires and then began the thankless job of digging out the smoldering hot spots . <p> If you are interested in the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1992 Fourth Annual Legislative Report . There have been 8,515 people entering the Shock Incarceration Program since it began on July 13 , 1987 . Because the program is so mentally and physically demanding , the removal rate is 38.8 percent . A total of 4,411 graduates , including 253 women , were released to parole as of September 30 , 1991 . For the first 4,411 releases from the Shock Program , the department has saved the New York State taxpayers an estimated $177 million in both operating and capital cost . New York State recreationists receive a tremendous benefit from the Rehab of Offenders Program . Similar projects that you 've just read about take place all over New York State every day . <p> If you 're ever in the Essex County Area , I strongly urge you to look up some of the above mentioned projects . if you happen to hear off in the distance , voices yelling " Fired up ! Fired up ! Motivated ! " do n't worry . it 's probably a Moriah Shock work crew engaged in one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Hammond Pond Wild Forest Area <p> Photo : Lean-to log is being transported with carriers <p> Photo : Lean-to logs for use at Moose Mountain Pond <p> Photo : A new bridge at Berrymill Brook-Hammond Pond Wild Forest Area <p> Photos ( 3 ) : Schroon River Fish Weir <p> Photo : A traditional Adirondack lean-to is nearing completion at Moose Mountain Pond . <p> By Tim Hendricks <p> Photographs by TIM HENDRICKS <p> <p> Tim Hendricks is a Conservation Operations Supervisor II in Region 5 . <p>
