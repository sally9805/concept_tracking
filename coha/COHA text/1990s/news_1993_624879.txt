<p> A recent column I wrote concerning excessive boat traffic on coastal flats sparked considerable response . The feedback that I received was unanimous in agreement that a problem exists  --  that our bay flats are being abused . <p> This is a touchy issue , but one that needs addressing . <p> First , I want to stress up front that I am not opposed to shallow-draft boats . Nor am I pointing a finger at any particular manufacturers or anglers . Frankly , fishing the shallow flats is one of my favorite types of angling . I reckon I 'd rather wade a bay flat , sight-casting to tailing reds or pothole trout , than participate in any other inshore fishing . <p> Many veteran coastal anglers share the same preference . Maybe that 's the problem . My boat 's OK , and your boat 's O.K. ; it 's all those other guys tearing across the flats . <p> The grassy , clear-water shallows of the middle and lower coast have , for generations , attracted experienced pluggers . In recent years , fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of boat traffic in " " skinny water " was minimal . <p> Fast boats in thin water were virtually unknown . <p> For example , Bob Brister wrote the cover story , What 's New  - -  The Fish Scooter , for the July 1958 ( yes , 1958 ) Outdoor Life . That nationally published article detailed the odd-ball rigs of E.A. Lewis , R.M. Elmore and Joe Bob Lawrence of Harlingen . The first one-man plywood-and-fiberglass scooters were 10 feet in length and four feet in beam . They were powered by a 10- or 12-horsepower outboard and steered with a crossbar . You leaned to turn  --  and I suppose you could run the vast Laguna Madre all day without seeing another shallow-water boat . <p> Well , that was in 1958 . The concept proved very effective and spawned a specialized school of fishing that continues to grow . The Texas scooters combined with the Florida bonefish skiffs and the ubiquitous airboats are criss-crossing virtually every inch of fishable tide in the middle and lower coastal bays . <p> This traffic is taking a toll . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The grass beds are sliced and diced as each boat with a lower unit races through . <p> And , race we do . Covering water , lots of water , is the traditional name of the game . A caption of the long-ago Outdoor Life article said , " " Scooter fishermen can split up , search quickly across many miles of flats , then rendezvous when somebody finds a school they can all work . " <p> That remains a standard drill . You run to locate action . This running can chew up a lot of bottom . Then , when you shut down , you 've got to pop back up . This usually means gouging a hole , either with a running start or by making a tight and leaning turn to ride up on the bulging wake . Aborted attempts are common . <p> Regardless , the start spews mud , grass and shell and your passage leaves a mark . <p> The alternative is to drift or push or pole off the flat to a deeper launch site . A " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open water , and the salvation of extra inches may be hundred of yards distant . Frankly , many boaters are not willing to make the commitment in time and toil for a soft exit . They  --  we  --  blow up the bottom and race away . <p> That 's just the way we 've always done it . <p> This rough treatment destroys the fragile bay bottom and , also a consideration , it disrupts marine life . Specifically , it can spook the spots and dots off the very fish we came to catch . The noise and vibration of a big hull and a powerful motor tearing through inches of water stampedes all fish in its path . You see them scattering and boiling like tracers . You even hit them . <p> The key factor here is depth . Fish in 10 or 12 inches of water are much more vulnerable to boat traffic than fish in 10 or 12 feet of water . Or even six feet of water . The open depth provides insulation ; a school of reds in deeper water may dart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regroup with minimal fuss . The same fish in shin-deep water are  --  well , you figure it out as 150 horses scream with churning sand and exploding grass through the middle of a school . <p> These fish with their tails blown off are going to take a while to settle down . Oh , wait  --  here comes another scooter . Whoa  --  and behind it a bonefish skiff . A flat known to hold a good tide and a concentration of fish will draw repeated , often overlapping traffic . No wonder the pods of lazy , " " happy " tailing reds seem harder to locate . <p> A decade ago , a " " tricked " flats boat was the exception ; now it is the norm among bay anglers aiming south of Matagorda . What began as the zany concept of a few has become , in various designs , the standard drill . So , we have a problem . A growing problem . <p> Again , let me emphasize that I am not against shallow-water boats . They are super . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A solution I proposed in the previous column was prohibiting motorized boat traffic in certain , well-defined coves or " " lakes . " These sanctuaries would be reserved for wading or poling , only . <p> This might not be an ideal answer but at least it would allow those privileged areas to regroup . A pair of wading booties or a slow push pole creates minor impact , and only the most gung-ho anglers would be willing to work to the extreme back waters . <p> The feedback on this concept was supportive . Here 's a sampling of letters : " " I fully endorse your ideas about limiting certain shallow-water estuarine area . " " " You need to know that there exists a large number of fishermen who share your view ! Many of us have dwelled on the " prop ribbons ' that scar so many of our wading flats . " <p> " " I fish Port O'Connor and can think of several perfect examples of naturally protected pockets that would be ideal for a " flats preserve '  --  east end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green 's Bayou ( with entrance buoy markers ) . " <p> No doubt some airboat drivers are thinking , " " Well , wait a minute ; why should I be restricted . I do n't have a lower unit that tears up the bottom . " True , the airboat is the most " " user friendly " to the bay , but the fact that an airboat can run in an inch or two of water robs fish of the last unmolested tides . And , a running airboat will molest fish  --  not to mention everything with ears within several hundred yards . <p> No , I am not against airboats . They are legitimate fishing machines . I 've had marvelous trips via airboats but you 've got to admit they are pretty damned obnoxious . The roaring fan disrupts the very mood you seek to establish on the water . And , increasingly in our urban society , peace and quiet are goals of the outdoor experience . <p> Significantly , the lead story in the August 1993 issue of Backpacker details , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming that significant . <p> The " " noise pollution " of an airboat , alone , would strike the machine from any proposed flats refuge . <p> The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has done a great job of protecting and replenishing redfish stocks in coastal bays . The fish are there , in increasing numbers , but so are the shallow-running boats . <p> A lower coastal guide recently told me , " " I can almost always put a party on a limit of redfish , but we usually have to blind fish in deeper water . I ca n't always guarantee reliable sight casting on the flats . And that 's a shame because that 's what the Laguna is all about . " <p> Maybe the safeguarding of flats is a minor issue when measured against wholesale catastrophies such as toxic dumping , killer freezes , and algae blooms . But this is a problem that we , as anglers , are responsible for , and one that we directly can address . <p> Redfish production and protection certainly are priorities but more attention needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , on preserving the quality , not just the quantity of the fishing . We must become more shallow-minded.
