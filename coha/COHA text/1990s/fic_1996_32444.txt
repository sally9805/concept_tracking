Under certain circumstances there are few hours in life more agreeable than the hour dedicated to the ceremony known as afternoon tea . There are circumstances in which , whether you partake of the tea or not-some people of course never do-the situation is in itself delightful . Those that I have in mind in beginning to unfold this simple history offered an admirable setting to an innocent pastime . The implements of the little feast had been disposed upon the lawn of an old English country house in what I should call the perfect middle of a splendid summer afternoon . Part of the afternoon had waned , but much of it was left , and what was left was of the finest and rarest quality . Real dusk would not arrive for many hours ; but the flood of summer light had begun to ebb , the air had grown mellow , the shadows were long upon the smooth , dense turf . They lengthened slowly , however , and the scene expressed that sense of leisure still to come which is perhaps the chief source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour . From five o'clock to eight is on certain occasions a little eternity ; but on such an occasion as this the interval could be only an eternity of pleasure . The persons concerned in it were taking their pleasure quietly , and they were not of the sex which is supposed to furnish the regular votaries of the ceremony I have mentioned . Theshadows on the perfect lawn were straight and angular ; they were the shadows of an old man sitting in a deep wicker-chair near the low table on which the tea had been served , and of two younger men strolling to and fro , in desultory talk , in front of him . The old man had his cup in his hand ; it was an unusually large cup , of a different pattern from the rest of the set and painted in brilliant colours . He disposed of its contents with much circumspection , holding it for a long time close to his chin , with his face turned to the house . His companions had either finished their tea or were indifferent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stroll . One of them , from time to time , as he passed , looked with a certain attention at the elder man , who , unconscious of observation , rested his eyes upon the rich red front of his dwelling . The house that rose beyond the lawn was a structure to repay such consideration and was the most characteristic object in the peculiarly English picture I have attempted to sketch . It stood upon a low hill , above the river-the river being the Thames at some forty miles from London . A long gabled front of red brick , with the complexion of which time and the weather had played all sorts of pictorial tricks , only , however , to improve and refine it , presented to the lawn its patches of ivy , its clustered chimneys , its windows smothered in creepers . The house had a name and a history ; the old gentleman taking his tea would have been delighted to tell you these things : how it had been built under Edward the Sixth , had offered a night 's hospitality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself upon a huge , magnificent , and terribly angular bed which still formed the principle honour of the sleeping apartments ) , had been a good deal bruised and defaced in Cromwell 's wars , and then , under the Restoration , repaired and much enlarged ; and how , finally , after having been remodelled and disfigured in the eighteenth century , it had passed into the careful keeping of a shrewd American banker , who had bought it originally because ( owing to circumstances too complicated to set forth ) it was offered at a great bargain : bought it with much grumbling at its ugliness , its antiquity , its incommodity , and who now , at the end of twenty years , had become conscious of a real aesthetic passion for it , so that he knew all its points and would tell you just where to stand to see them in combination and just the hour when the shadows of its various protuberances-which fell so softly upon the warm , weary brickwork-were of the right measure . Besides this , as I have said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and occupants , several of whom were known to general fame ; doing so , however , with an undemonstrative conviction that the latest phase of its destiny was not the least honourable . The front of the house overlooking that portion of lawn with which we are concerned was not the entrance-front ; this was in quite another quarter . Privacy here reigned supreme , and the wide carpet of turf that covered the level hill-top seemed but the extension of a luxurious interior . The great still oaks and beeches flung down a shade as dense as that of velvet curtains ; and the place was furnished , like a room , with cushioned seats , with rich-coloured rugs , with the books and papers that lay upon the grass . The river was at some distance ; where the ground began to slope the lawn , properly speaking , ceased . But it was none the less a charming walk down to the water . The old gentleman at the tea-table , who had come from America thirty years before , had brought with him , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had not only brought it with him , but he had kept it in the best order , so that , if necessary , he might have taken it back to his own country with perfect confidence . At present , obviously , nevertheless , he was not likely to displace himself ; his journeys were over and he was taking the rest that precedes the great rest . He had a narrow , clean-shaven face , with features evenly distributed and an expression of placid acuteness . It was evidently a face in which the range of representation was not large , so that the air of contented shrewdness was all the more of a merit . It seemed to tell that he had been successful in life , yet it seemed to tell also that his success had not been exclusive and invidious , but had had much of the inoffensiveness of failure . He had certainly had a great experience of men , but there was an almost rustic simplicity in the faint smile that played upon his lean , spacious cheek and lighted up his humorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big tea-cup upon the table . He was neatly dressed , in well-brushed black ; but a shawl was folded upon his knees , and his feet were encased in thick , embroidered slippers . A beautiful collie dog lay upon the grass near his chair , watching the master 's face almost as tenderly as the master took in the still more magisterial physiognomy of the house ; and a little bristling , bustling terrier bestowed a desultory attendance upon the other gentlemen . One of these was a remarkably well-made man of five-and-thirty , with a face as English as that of the old gentleman I have just sketched was something else ; a noticeably handsome face , fresh-coloured , fair and frank , with firm , straight features , a lively grey eye and the rich adornment of a chestnut beard . This person had a certain fortunate , brilliant , exceptional look-the air of a happy temperament fertilized by a high civilization-which would have made almost any observer envy him at a venture . He was booted and spurred , as if he had dismounted from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked too large for him ; he held his two hands behind him , and in one of them-a large , white , well-shaped fist-was crumpled a pair of soiled dog-skin gloves . His companion , measuring the length of the lawn beside him , was a person of quite a different pattern , who , although he might have excited grave curiosity , would not , like the other , have provoked you to wish yourself , almost blindly , in his place . Tall , lean , loosely and feebly put together , he had an ugly , sickly , witty , charming face , furnished , but by no means decorated , with a straggling moustache and whisker . He looked clever and ill-a combination by no means felicitous ; and he wore a brown velvet jacket . He carried his hands in his pockets , and there was something in the way he did it that showed the habit was inveterate . His gait had a shambling , wandering quality ; he was not very firm on his legs . As I have said , whenever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes upon him ; and at this moment , with their faces brought into relation , you would easily have seen they were father and son . The father caught his son 's eye at last and gave him a mild , responsive smile . " I 'm getting on very well , " he said . " Have you drunk your tea ? " asked the son . " Yes , and enjoyed it . " " Shall I give you some more ? " The old man considered , placidly . " Well , I guess I 'll wait and see . " He had , in speaking , the American tone . " Are you cold ? " the son inquired . The father slowly rubbed his legs . " Well , I do n't know . I ca n't tell till I feel . " " Perhaps someone might feel for you , " said the younger man , laughing . " Oh , I hope someone will always feel for me ! Do n't you feel for me , Lord Warburton ? " " Oh yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warburton , promptly . " I 'm bound to say you look wonderfully comfortable . " " Well , I suppose I am , in most respects . " And the old man looked down at his green shawl and smoothed it over his knees . " The fact is I 've been comfortable so many years that I suppose I 've got so used to it I do n't know it . " " Yes , that 's the bore of comfort , " said Lord Warburton . " We only know when we 're uncomfortable . " " It strikes me we 're rather particular , " his companion remarked . " Oh yes , there 's no doubt we 're particular , " Lord Warburton murmured . And then the three men remained silent a while ; the two younger ones standing looking down at the other , who presently asked for more tea . " I should think you would be very unhappy with that shawl , " Lord Warburton resumed while his companion filled the old man 's cup again . " Oh no , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the velvet coat . " Do n't put such ideas as that into his head . " " It belongs to my wife , " said the old man simply . " Oh , if it 's for sentimental reasons- " And Lord Warburton made a gesture of apology . " I suppose I must give it to her when she comes , " the old man went on . You 'll please to do nothing of the kind . You 'll keep it to cover your poor old legs " " Well , you must n't abuse my legs , " said the old man . " I guess they are as good as yours . " " Oh , you 're perfectly free to abuse mine , " his son replied , giving him his tea . " Well , we 're two lame ducks ; I do n't think there 's much difference . " " I 'm much obliged to you for calling me a duck . How 's your tea ? " " Well , it 's rather hot . " " That 's intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal of merit , " murmured the old man , kindly . " He 's a very good nurse , Lord Warburton . " " Is n't he a bit clumsy ? " asked his lordship . " Oh no , he 's not clumsy-considering that he 's an invalid himself . He 's a very good nurse-for a sick-nurse . I call him my sick-nurse because he 's sick himself . " " Oh , come , daddy ! " the ugly young man exclaimed . " Well , you are ; I wish you were n't . But I suppose you ca n't help it . " " I might try : that 's an idea , " said the young man . " Were you ever sick , Lord Warburton ? " his father asked . Lord Warburton considered a moment . " Yes , sir , once , in the Persian Gulf . " " He 's making light of you , daddy , " said the other young man . " That 's a sort of joke " " Well , there seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serenely . " You do n't look as if you had been sick , anyway , Lord Warburton . " " He 's sick of life ; he was just telling me so ; going on fearfully about it , " said Lord Warburton 's friend . " Is that true , sir ? " asked the old man gravely . " If it is , your son gave me no consolation . He 's a wretched fellow to talk to-a regular cynic . He does n't seem to believe in anything . " " That 's another sort of joke , " said the person accused of cynicism . " It 's because his health is so poor , " his father explained to Lord Warburton . " It affects his mind and colours his way of looking at things ; he seems to feel as if he had never had a chance . But it 's almost entirely theoretical , you know ; it does n't seem to affect his spirits . I 've hardly ever seen him when he was n't cheerful-about as he is at present . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so described looked at Lard Warburton and laughed . " Is it a glowing eulogy or an accusation of levity ? Should you like me to carry out my theories , daddy ? " " By Jove , we should see some queer things ! " cried Lord Warburton . " I hope you have n't taken up that sort of tone , " said the old man . " Warburton 's tone is worse than mine ; he pretends to be bored . I 'm not in the least bored ; I find life only too interesting . " " Ah , too interesting ; you should n't allow it to be that , you know ! " " I 'm never bored when I come here , " said Lord Warburton . " One gets such uncommonly good talk . " " Is that another sort of joke ? " asked the old man . " You 've no excuse for being bored anywhere . When I was your age I had never heard of such a thing . " " You must have developed very late . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the reason . When I was twenty years old I was very highly developed indeed . I was working tooth and nail . You would n't be bored if you had something to do ; but all you young men are too idle . You think too much of your pleasure . You 're too fastidious , and too indolent , and too rich . " " Oh , I say , " cried Lord Warburton , " you 're hardly the person to accuse a fellow-creature of being too rich ! " " Do you mean because I 'm a banker ? " asked the old man . " Because of that , if you like ; and because you have-have n't you ? - such unlimited means . " " He is n't very rich , " the other young man mercifully pleaded . " He has given away an immense deal of money . " " Well , I suppose it was his own , " said Lord Warburton ; " and in that case could there be a better proof of wealth ? Let not a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Daddy 's very fond of pleasure-of other people 's . " The old man shook his head . " I do n't pretend to have contributed anything to the amusement of my contemporaries . " " My dear father , you 're too modest ! " " That 's a kind of joke , sir , " said Lord Warburton . " You young men have too many jokes . When there are no jokes you 've nothing left . " " Fortunately there are always more jokes , " the ugly young man remarked . &lt; Continues ...
