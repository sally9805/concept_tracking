" He had his shirt off " and we were kind of playing around with my clip-on earring . Just teasing , I clipped it on his nipple . He loved it and suddenly became incredibly passionate .

But if guy likes , say , to have his butt grabbed or his earlobes nibbled , why does n't he just ask ?

" Grab that tush ! " encouraged one game guy . A few even likened their butts to sexual steering wheels : " Hard butt-trabbing during intercourse helps us understand how deep and at what angle you want us to go . " Gentlemen , start your engines ! Smooth first move : Your best bet is to try a little butt boogaloo next time he 's about to have an orgasm . " As soon as he starts building for his climax , grab that crease where his butt meets his thighs and firmly pull him into you with each thrust , " advises Barbara Keesling , Ph.D. , a sex therapist in Newport Beach , California , and author of Super Sexual Orgasms ( HarperCollins , 1997 ) . And do n't worry he wo n't get freaky over your getting cheeky : The guys we heard from loved this idea . Graduate-level groping : If your man groves to your opening moves , rock his world by taking things one step further . " Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hips and press your thumbs into the side of each buttock , " advises Dan Anderson , coauthor of Sex Tips for Straight Voinen From a Gay Man ( HarperCollins , 1997 ) . " Using fairly forceful pressure , rotate your thumbs while you squeeze the rest of the buttocks with your fingers . " One Cosmo staffer who took Dan 's advice says , " At first I felt silly when I tried this on my man . But when he let loose a moan of pleasure-and then told me he 'd had one of his biggest climaxes ever ! -I decided to add it to my permanent repertoire . " Photograph // GIVE-IT-SHOT SPOT 2 His Family Jewels Ninety-six percent of respondents to our Internet survey said they want you to play hall ! " With your fingertips , make tiny circles with your nails , " begs one surveyed confessor . " Use the whole tongue , not just the tip , " said another survey respondent . " Please , please , please take them both in your mouth , hold them snugly with your teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third replier . Smooth first move : Every guy we talked to emphasized the importance of being gentle . " My buddies and I were talking about this just the other day . If a guys ever received a hit or kick between his legsand most of us have-he 's likely to remember it forever and be really ncrvous about any ballhandling , " says Leon Sopor , 24 , a graduate student in economics in Madison , Wisconsin . Easy does it-but do do it . " The same sensitivity that makes the testicles exquisitely sailnerable to pain also makes them equally sensitive to pleasure , " says Zilbergeld . Your key to warding off his jock shock ? Demonstrate your ball-handling expertise right off the bat . " He 'll he at ease if he 's confident you know what you 're doing , " advises author Anderson , who recommends mastering a basic maneuver called the L-hold . " Place your hand , palm up , under his testicles , then use your thumb and index finger to make a fairly tight ring at the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 'll never accidentally squeeze his twins so they move in opposite directions within the sac-a big " ouch " for him ! One tip : Do n't freak if , while you 're playing ball , his bat goes limp . " Since many men find testicle stroking as relaxing as it is stimulating , your man may lose his erection during your maneuvers , " explains Douglas Arava , coauthor of The Mtiltiorgasmic Man ( Harper San Francisco , 1996 ) . " It 's not that he 's not loving what you 're doing-it 's just that he 's super-relaxed . " If you have any doubt that he 's enjoying himself , ask . Graduate-level groping : If you 've had a successful first inning , he 's probably ready For a doubleheader !

" If you try this , he 'll think you 're the coolest and most creative lover he 's ever had and will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please you . " GIVE-IT-A-SHOT SPOT 3 His Ears Listen up : Ninety-two percent of survey respondents said they 'd like more aural sex . " I love it when you whisper something sexy in a light , hot breath into my ear and then suck my carlobes , " says one car-lover who responded to our survey . But for all the applause , we heard several cautionary notes : " If you go too deep with your tongue , all we hear is this squishy wet sound , " alerts one survey guy " And a too-firm kiss on the carcan cause painful suction , " laments one male Cosmo staffer . Smooth first move : Ear stimulation is tricky , because the 8 percent who do n't like it really do n't like it . So proceed with caution at first . " Start off by lightly tracing his outer car with your fingernail . Gently stroke thc lobe , maybe do a little soft blowing , " recommends Arava . If he 's an ear man , you should know it immediately . Graduate-level groping : If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try a tongnc tango . " My new girlfriend did something this morning that my childhood pals and I used to call the Wet Willy , " recalls Steve Smithington , 31 , a banker in Dayton , Ohio . " But she seemed to know exactly how to make it feel sensual and not icky . She gently rolled her tongue around the outline of my ear , while breathing softly across it . Then , as she circlcd in toward the canal with her tongue , her darting movements drove me wild . Wowza ! " GIVE-IT  --  SHOT SPOT 4 His Nipples Why do men have nipples anyway ? Well , 86 percent of the men who responded to our survey said they 'd like you to play with them and find out . " I like it when you use very small sucking and licking motions , " raves one nipple-nipping fan . " But too much motion and it fcels like you 're mechanically trying to remove my nipple . " Smooth first move : Since some of the men we spoke to-and 14 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start slow . " Although many men experience pleasurable nipple erections just like women , some require persistent , regular stimulation to awaken the nerves responsible for the pleasurable sensation , " says author Arava . " And a few never warm to this touch no matter how much you try . " A good way to test the waters : Start kissing him all over his chest , slowly zeroing in on the nipples . If he 's ging and/or otherwise egging you on , try a few quick tongue flicks , then softly blow . " The sensation of cool air on the moist nipple should wow him , " predicts Anderson . If the dab does n't do him , move on . Graduate-level groping : If he likes your nipple-lite , add some hite . " My current honey , Ben , finally helped me realize why guys never got totally hot when I played with their nipples , " explains Lucy Catena , 24 , an art student in Baltimore . " I was working the right area , just not working it with enough forceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing with them , I hite and tug ( gently ) until he 's on the verge of coming . By then , he 's so grateful , I get whatever I want . " GIVE-IT-A-SHOT SPOT 5 His " Taint " When it comes to the pleasure patch between the scrotum and the anus that medical types call the perineum and regular guys call the taint ( " t'ai n't your balls , t'ai n't your bottom " ) , 86 percent of survey respondents said stay and play . " More women need to be told about this littleknown spot , " one respondent advised us . " Most women I 've been with have n't even gone near it , which is a shame , because it 's one of my favorite hot spots . " Smooth first move : Since some men are a little wary of any action down there- " It 's just too close to my exit-only , " notes one survey guy-proceed with caution . Why risk it at all ? Because pushing on the perineum is a way of stroking your man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not end at his pubic hair : The two internal tubes that fill up with blood when lie becomes aroused ( and swell to cause his erection ) actually extend into his body several inches . And they 're situated just above his perineum . So when you press on that pleasure point , he feels it as an inner penis caress ! " Stroking or a few light pushes here can send him over the edge faster than you can say Niagara Falls , " says Anderson . So plan your move for a time wilen you 're ready for him to fire his cannon . That 's what worked for Wendy O'Hara , 27 , an accountant in Portland , Oregon . " One night , while my boyfriend and I were making love , I had had my orgasm and was ready for him to let loose . While I was exploring down there , I pushed the patch at the base of scrotum . I could n't believe how loud he groaned and how fast and furiously he climaxed ! Now , whenever I 'm ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . " Graduate-level groping : In addition to using the taint as a qluick-come button , you can also enlist it in foreplay . " Anytime you 're touching or licking the penis , try keeping your finger in one place and pumping the perineum up and down-kind of like pressing the same key on a typewriter over and over . This will get maximum blood flowing and keep his erection growing , " advises Anderson . Or for something entirely dif ferent , trv pushing very hard contiiously Ior several seconds . " When a man receives consistent firm pressure on his perineum as he 's about to climax , it can sometimes result in his feeling the sensation tof orgasm without actually ejaculating , " says sex-expert Keesling . Margaret Leland , 33 , a lawyer practicing in Washington , D.C. , found that out the exciting way . " One night , I was stroking the area between his testicles and butt , but this time , I pushed as hard as I could and just held it instead Of pumping . Next thing I knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did it over and Over again-with him feeling the pleasure of the climax each time-until I took my finger off the trigger and let him explode ! " GNE-IT-A-SHOT SPOT 6 His Inner Thighs Eighty-four percent of survey men jotted down their preference for a little thigh-jinx . " Kiss , lick , or nibble gentlyespecially at the depression just up from the knee on the inside of the thigh , " encourages one leg man who responded to our survey . Another told us he loves it when his " girlfriend grinds her privates into my thigh and mbs up and down . " Smooth first move : " You may already have noticed that many men have a little bald spot on their inner thighs , " notes Anderson . " Its a great place to play around in . Use gentle nips and nibbles to massage . " Since our survey respondents cautioned not to linger too long here-and there 's not really that much to do-skip the grad-level groping and move on to hotter pastures . GIVE-IT-A-SHOT SPOT 7 His Backdoor More than half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to venture , well , between the cheeks . " Gentle pressure down inside there is a great way to enhance oral sex , " notes one rear guy . " The first time a woman licked me there , I nearly lost my mind , it felt so good , " observes another . Smooth first move : Since a lot of men37 percent by our count-consider the area to taboo for your explorations , you 'll need to be savvy in your approach . One of the most subtle ways to approach his rear is to " back up " for a second . " The most erotic thing a woman 's ever done to me was to kiss me along my spine from neck to hutt , " recalls Thomas Bailey , 26 , a graphic designer in Chicago . " She then blew lightly on the trail of kisses and continued downward , finally licking my rear . " You can use the same strategy-just monitor his reactions closely . If he stops moaning and starts shifting nervously , you 'll know he 's strictly an up-front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the 63 percent who 's into this , he 's way into it . Says Joe Martinelli , a 30-year-old computer programmer in San Antonio , Texas : " If a woman licks and flicks her tongue around my backside , there 's no question that I 'll be her sex slave forever .
