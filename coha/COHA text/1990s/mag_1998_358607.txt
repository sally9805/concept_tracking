It takes the Gospel According to Matthew fewer than 50 lines to deal with Jesus ' 40 days in the wilderness , about double the length of the following un-King Jamesian summary : the newly baptized Galilean retreats to the Judean desert where he is mocked and enticed by the devil ; Jesus does not take the bait ; he wo n't turn stones into bread because man does not live by bread alone ; he wo n't jump from the temple tower to prove his divinity because it is forbidden to presume God 's protection ; finally , he rejects the Faustian bargain  --  the world 's riches for his soul . <P> Jim Crace 's Quarantine ( Farrar , Straus and Giroux ; 243 pages ; $23 ) novelizes the Temptations of Christ , adding a plot bubbling with sin and a supporting cast of odd pilgrims . Crace , a British journalist turned novelist ( The Gift of Stones , Continent ) , is not the first writer to take fictional liberties with Scripture . He wo n't be the last . But his new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Readers and critics in Britain thought so : when Quarantine was published there last year , it was short-listed for the Booker Prize and won the Whitbread Novel of the Year Award . <P> Crace 's portrayal of Jesus combines eerie realism with supernatural powers , sort of like a biblical X-Files . At this early stage in his short life the pious Jewish peasant thinks of himself as a gifted healer . Indeed , he cures one of his first patients  --  a dying merchant  --  with what seems like one-handed CPR . Musa , the revived trader , is not particularly grateful . His first thought is to sign up the young Jewish healer for a traveling medicine show . Musa is worldliness made flesh , the sort of opportunist and schemer who if asked to swap his soul for profit would probably respond , " What 's the catch ? " By contrast , Crace 's Messiah-in-training is a bit of a stick : an inept carpenter with a stuffy nose , a functional illiterate , the kind of cheerless guy who has to make camping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand he has an iron will . Starved and dangerously dehydrated , he resists the tantalizing bribes of food and water that Musa dangles in front of the keyhole opening in the cliff face where Jesus fasts and prays . Crace 's tempter , then , is not a flapping , sulfurous devil , only a man whose demons and unactivated angels are part of his nature . <P> There is no question that Quarantine is a serious and skillfully crafted novel about folly , faith and a radically new relationship between a people and its god . But it is not a solemn book . Crace 's characters are animated by timeless urges . His prose is startlingly specific about ancient life and Judea 's harsh , terrible beauty . Unlike many authors of biblical fiction , he blends his research smoothly into his narrative and adds a leavening pinch of humor . Musa is like a preincarnation of Zero Mostel , especially when he orders flunkies to push a dead donkey over a cliff . Awaiting a sign from God , a surprised and unquestioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> At such moments Quarantine has the feel of Samuel Beckett 's philosophical vaudeville . But that is where any comparison with the playwright should end . None of Crace 's characters is a despairing optimist waiting for Godot or any other no-show . Sacred or profane , each represents the beginning , not the end , of an era . <P>  --  By R.Z. Sheppard
