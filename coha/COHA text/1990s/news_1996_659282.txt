<p> Deirdre and Dewar McLeod are gathering some flock of sheepskin . <p> She has a bachelor 's degree in semiotics and a master 's in creative writing , and will soon earn a doctorate in English literature . He holds a bachelor 's in humanities and is working on his master 's and Ph.D . in American history . <p> With those accumulating degrees , comes an accumulation of debt - loads of it - as much as $ 50,000 for the Brooklyn , N.Y. , couple combined . <p> " I do n't even know what my payments are going to be . I try not to think about it , " said Mrs. McLeod , 36 , a part-time college instructor who begins regular loan payments once her dissertation is filed and the degree awarded . <p> " I 'm glad they ( the loans ) were there . ( But ) I do n't think I would do it again , " she said . The McLeods will likely have to forgo buying a home and car and putting aside college savings for 4-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure full-time jobs . <p> Thousands of college graduates are lamenting the long-term consequences of taking on debt to finance an education : a drain on their monthly income , a crimp on lifestyle and meager savings or investments . But failure to meet student loan obligations could spell financial disaster - wages can be garnished , tax refunds intercepted and credit ruined . <p> Reality usually begins to set in during the fall , with the official end of the typical six-month grace period for loan paybacks for spring graduates . Lenders presume graduates will have had a chance to land jobs in their chosen fields by now . <p> Yet that 's often not the case . " That 's our No. 1 topic , I would say , " said Ken Kurson , 27-year-old editor of Green , a New York-based personal finance newsletter for Generation Xers . He gets letters from readers complaining that the lack of jobs and heavy student loans affects the quality of their lives . <p> That 's happened to some degree to 26-year-old Jennifer Sesen Klein , of the Washington , D.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20,000 in student loans in pursuit of a journalism degree at New York University . She made regular payments after her first full-time job , but is now unemployed and depends upon her husband to help with the $ 225 monthly payments . She already was granted one deferment on the loans . <p> Sensitive to the plight of others like her , Klein recently started the National Association of Twentysomethings in Washington . The group provides members with the opportunity to buy health insurance and services like discounts on car rentals . <p> " As a student you do n't think about all the loans you have to take out , " said Klein . " You want to go to the best school you can go to because you will some day be competing for a job . " <p> Mrs. McLeod has spent the last three years looking for a good , full-time tenure-track teaching job as she finished up her dissertation at City University of New York . <p> " When I started the ( Ph.D. ) program , I was told there were two jobs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , " she said . " Right now we have to depend upon the kindness of relatives . " <p> " It 's punishing , " agreed James Lowell , 36 , author of " How to Survive in the Real World : Financial Independence for the Recent Graduate . " <p> " It 's not uncommon to spend 25 to 30 percent of after-tax pay on student loans . ( The average is 10 percent . ) This is why you really need to weigh the return on the investment , " he said , referring to a student 's choice of school and degree . <p> But as increases in college tuition surpass the rate of inflation each year and as competition escalates for a limited pool of grant money , students are depending more on loans regardless of whether they pick an Ivy League school or public college . <p> Twenty years ago , students took out about $ 1.20 in loans for every $ 1 in federal grants they received . Today that proportion is $ 3.80 in student loans for each $ 1 in grants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support has edged down , partly because undergraduates are older . Half of all undergrads are over the age of 24 and often out of their parents ' homes . <p> The total median amount of educational loans taken out jumped 153 percent , to $ 16,417 per student in 1991 from $ 6,488 in 1995 , raising median monthly payments to $ 180 from $ 80 . Students take out on average $ 17,000 in loans today . <p> " It 's easier for the government to provide money for loans than for grants because that money goes back into its coffers ... although you can argue that grants are a good investment in someone who will be a good future taxpayer , " said Diane Saunders , spokesperson for Nellie Mae , another national student lending agency . <p> Demand for loans is climbing . As much as $ 29 billion in student loans is expected to be made this year through 1,200 financial institutions and 5,000 schools , up from an estimated $ 27 billion last year and $ 9 billion just 11 years ago , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Josh Dare , a SallieMae spokesman , notes that default rates have n't gone up . They fell to 11.6 percent in 1993 from 22.4 percent in 1990 . <p> Major lenders offer several repayment options besides the standard 10-year plan . Loan terms can be extended to a period of up to 30 years , depending on how much is owed . Multiple loans can be consolidated , including those spouses take out separately . <p> There are graduated plans in which payments are low the first few years - usually just the interest is paid - then raised gradually at a predetermined rate . There are also plans based on income - these payments equal a percentage of a borrower 's gross income and they are adjusted annually based on the individual 's income tax returns . <p> Headline : Advise for managing student loan payments : <p> TEXT : <p> - Know your obligations . All schools must provide entrance and exit counseling for students obtaining loans . Before graduation , you should have received a disclosure statement outlining principal and interest owed and estimated monthly payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a six-month grace period after graduation . Use that time to develop a workable budget and to put aside money for upcoming loan payments . Avoid taking on new debt , unless there 's ample income to handle it . <p> - Rework loan terms . Lenders offer repayment options besides the standard 10-year plan and allow borrowers to make the change without a fee . Multiple loans can be consolidated , loan terms can be extended to up to 30 years and payments can be reduced so they gradually increase over years or reflect annual gross income . <p> - Defer payments . You might qualify for a temporary reprieve from your responsibilities if , for example , you 're unemployed , returning to school full-time or volunteering full-time in an eligible tax-exempt organization like the Peace Corps . There are other ways to qualify . However , it 's only a postponement for a period of up to three years . <p> - Barter skills . In rare cases , a school might forgive a portion of a loan if the borrower agrees to perform public service , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some states also help doctors or dentists pay off loans in exchange for practicing in areas designated by the federal government as having a shortage of health care professionals . <p> - Pay it off . If you have more than one loan , pay off the one with the higher interest rate first . Remember : The lower the payment and longer the term , the more paid out in interest over the life of the loan . <p> - Keep in touch . The original lender may have sold your loan or contracted with a servicing agent to administer the account or collect payments . It 's crucial to keep track of all documents and to notify whoever handles the account of any changes to your name , address , phone number , or Social Security number . <p> End adv for release anytime
