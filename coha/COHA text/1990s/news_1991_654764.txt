<p> ' SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE " does an occasional sketch mocking German avant-garde talk shows . The sketch is called " Sprockets , " and its host , Dieter , sports a black turtleneck and serious intellectual eyewear . The purpose is to poke holes in the high-intensity , ultra-self-absorbed image of modern artists . <p> I 'm not lumping Robert Wilson in with that crowd , but it would n't be hard to do a sendup of this enigmatic artist and theater director . He has the look . He has the presence . He has the European suits and the ramrod profile . His movements are as precise as hands on a clock . <p> On the surface Mr. Wilson 's art induces the formal , distancing effect that people associate with modern art 's lack of humanity and humility - exactly what Saturday Night Live spoofs on television . But it 's clear there 's something more to his drawings , sculpture , and sketches . To appreciate his art , it 's important to know that Wilson does not create theater that most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturalistic " plays that portray ordinary people in recognizable dilemmas - your basic Tennessee Williams , Arthur Miller , or Lillian Hellman - falsify reality and are highly unnatural . <p> As Wilson told one reporter , " I think the more formal theaters , which are full of the artificial , are much more natural . There 's more mental space . There 's time to reflect , to think . They seem much closer to nature than this theater we call naturalism . " <p> This is a valuable clue to the Wilson approach . In an exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts , he has created installations using stage settings , lighting , and props from his past works . The visitor first walks through a long corridor wallpapered in photographic close-ups of tree bark . The sound of wind rustling through the leaves is heard from the sophisticated sound system . Human birdcalls fill the space . It 's the farthest thing from a forest , but it quiets the viewer and prepares him for what is to come . It invites contemplation in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let the movement hang suspended , open . <p> Wilson is adamant about allowing things to happen slowly , deliberately . Some commentators have likened his work to tableau vivant . This was a popular style of theater in the 18th century in which actors/models posed as living paintings . ( I have heard actor acquaintances complain that Wilson uses performers like pieces of furniture . ) But it could be said , and Wilson has , that everything in modern life - on stage and off - has been speeded up and bears no resemblance to life based in thought . <p> YOU may not agree with him , but for Wilson , the dream life is a potent thought-force in waking life . Like dreams , the graphite and chalk drawings in the exhibit are indistinct but penetrating . When I closed my eyes , I still saw the drawings . It 's similar to when I dream and see something that my mind defines and delineates , but when I wake it eludes me . This ephemeral quality inhabits both Wilson 's theater and art , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with architecture allows him to give form to the weightless visions and ideas that animate his art . He uses industrial materials for his sculpture : wire mesh , steel , glass , cast lead , and enameled wood . His " Hanging Chair " from the show " The Life and Times of Sigmund Freud " casts a shadow on the wall as precise as a draftsman 's line drawing . The " Lightbulb " from the production " Death , Destruction and Detroit I " begins as a theatrical emblem and recurs as a spectral charcoal drawing . One art form feeds the other . <p> My favorite piece of Wilson furniture/sculpture was missing from this show - an elegant , seductive black chaise longue from his 1988 theater piece , " Quartet , " but I found a substitute . The wire-mesh couch from the opera " Parzival " rivals anything a diva could recline on - ignoring for a moment the grid marks when she got up . <p> Another quintessential Wilson piece of architecture is a copper-edged water tank from " A Letter for Queen Victoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet high , is 6 or 8 feet long , and a couple of feet wide . A smaller version became a fish tank for a scene in " Quartet . " <p> Robert Wilson was on hand at the press opening , so I sidled up to him to ask if , in " Quartet , " he had intended for the water to slosh at exactly the same angle as the diagonal of his stage set . He laughed politely as if it had n't occurred to him , and said softly , " Actually , once this is filled with water , it 's a frame to be seen through . " End of conversation . <p> I did n't ask him about the " Quartet " goldfish . In 1988 , I toured backstage at the American Repertory Theater where the show was playing and talked to the technical director about the difficulties of bringing Wilson 's ideas to the stage . In rehearsal , it seems , Wilson noticed a filter had been placed on his copper-and-glass sculpture-cum-fishtank . He pointed it out to the crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubbles . He was gently told that the fish needed to breathe . <p> Finally , he and the crew agreed the filter would be taken off just before the tank was brought on stage . ( The crew kept replacement goldfish in a big garbage pail and drew a small black cross on the wall when a fish died . There were dozens of crosses . ) <p> This points to the single-minded intensity with which Wilson pursues his calling . It makes him slightly off-putting . It makes his art uncompromising , but also more interesting . He dominates your senses , making you examine time , space , beauty , and relevance . Most of all , the passing of time . <p> THE final installation of the exhibit has the effect of bracketing time . A life-size adult mannequin in fetal position , encased in a lucite box , travels slowly the length of the wall on a track . Behind the body , a display of small white lights blinks on and off . At the same time , a doll-size chair with a clock above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wall , although the clock and chair arrive at the bottom . <p> Surrounded by darkness and the sound of an eerie sea whistle , I felt isolated , even though there were reporters all around me . They too had fallen silent , watching the body inch along the wall . The forlorn noise of a dog barking somewhere in a backyard years away pulled at our collective imaginations . <p> What a strange thing Robert Wilson has composed , and how unforgettable . <p> " Robert Wilson 's Vision " runs through April 21 at the Museum of Fine Arts . It travels to Houston 's Contemporary Arts Museum June 15-Aug. 18 , and then to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art , Sept. 19-Dec. 1 .
