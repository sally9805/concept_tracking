txt // she saw in the past . Now , any apparent recall of the seeing of something as Y , ' seen ' before one understood ' Y-ness ' , could be ( I think is ) just an instance of case ( 2 ) . And the conceptualist can also offer an adequate analysis of such cases of apparent recall : while one ( so it would have seemed ) saw W at T , , what one was really looking at , though did not see , was ( from the perspective of T2 ) Y. Generalizing these considerations , if a percipient , P , perceives state of affairs , X , at time t , during an act of unreflective perception , then in principle P could on reflection become consciously aware that at t he or she is , or was , it would seem to P , perceiving Y , where Y is what X looked like to P ( unconsciously ) at t . Therefore even when one does not consciously recognize or identify what one is perceiving , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perceive X as ( some ) Y. And to perceive something as Y one must possess the concept ( i.e. , the appropriate conceptual resources ) of Y. In sum , to take the paradigmatic case of visual perception , there are three distinct types of visual processes : ( i ) an unreflective seeing as , ( ii ) a reflective seeing as , and ( iii ) a mere looking at ? a purely physical operation . ( This tripartite distinction can be extended to the other senses . ) To illustrate , as young children we might have looked at various bird species ; as informed adults with the appropriate conceptual resources , we not only can look at , but see and , additionally , consciously identify the distinct species of , e.g. , gulls . Thus , whereas the novice birdwatcher can ? field guide in hand ? reflectively see and identify a particular species as a Bonaparte 's Gull , the accomplished ornithologist can ? intent on finding a rare species ? unreflectively see , while not consciously identifying , this rather common species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection , the ornithologist can respond , ' Oh yes , I remember now that I saw some Bonaparte 's Gulls ' ? i.e. saw birds as Bonaparte 's Gulls ? ' but I was n't consciously attentive to them at the time . ' IV When we limit considerations about perception to the perception of familiar objects of medium size located in the foreground of our visual fields , it is easy to suppose that to look at is to see and that seeing is not concept-dependent . That the possession of concepts is a necessary condition of perceptual experience is more obvious // perhaps if we consider less familiar cases such as optical illusions and the perceptions of adult perceivers who possess quite different conceptual schemas from ours . Turning first to optical illusions , consider the Adelbert Ames revolving trapezoid . A vertical trapezoid , with one short side , is viewed as it revolves on an axis which , in the same plane as the trapezoid , runs through the centre of the trapezoid and parallel to the short side . Viewing the alternating short and long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figure as swinging back and forth in a 180 ? arc , with the short side always to the rear , rather than as revolving through 360 ? . Even with the added knowledge of the actual construction of the trapezoid and its circular rotation , it is virtually impossible to override one 's perception of the figure as swinging back and forth in a 180 ? arc . Now , in order for the trapezoid to be perceived in this manner , at least two ( unconscious ) elements of the percipient 's conceptual schema become operative : first , the object before the viewer is categorized as a member of the set of more familiar symmetrical objects with sides of equal length , and second , what appears as the smallest entity among several of the same basic type ( here sides of the trapezoid ) is presumed ( because of the principles of perspective ) to be in fact more distant . In this instance , the conceptualization of perceptual experience is both blatant and considerable , and the distinction between ' looking at ? and ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the state of affairs before one ( a revolving figure ) ; quite another to see ( a figure swinging through an arc ) . I might learn about the circular rotation and the irregular sides by other means , such as studying a diagram of the Adelbert Ames revolving trapezoid , but at this moment all I am aware of perceptually ? that is , all I see ? is a regular figure swinging back and forth through an arc . What I see is conceptualized ; and so what I see is not necessarily identical with what I look at.9 That concept possession is a necessary condition for perceptual experience can also be seen by considering how the possession of different concepts results in different perceptual experiences . If one did not possess the concept of a tomato or of a red patch , then one could not ( perhaps consciously ) perceive a tomato or red patch , respectively . Thus , in looking at what we call a tomato , one-yearolds , or Australian bushrnen , may not be able to , and probably do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see is a reddish plaything , or reddish edible . ) One might object , ' But if I or a bushman or a // one-year-old are all staring at a tomato and we all discriminate something or other ? whether it is thought of as a reddish patch or a fruit ? then we are all seeing the same thing , a tomato ' . To answer this , we must first note an implication of the principle that all perceiving is perceiving as . It follows from , e.g. , all seeing being seeing as , that rather than the seeing of facts being founded on the seeing of things , the seeing of things is reducible to ( actually consists in ) the seeing of facts ? facts not necessarily seen as facts , but seen facts nevertheless . Against this conceptualist position , Frank Jackson argues in Perception that seeing things can not be analyzed in terms of seeing that : It is clear that ' S sees A ' can not be analyzed as ' S sees that A is F ' . This follows immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' S sees A ' is subject to substitutivity ( of co-referential terms ) , it is not in ' S sees that A is F ' .10 There are two difficulties with Jackson 's proposal . In the first place , if one were to analyze ' S sees A ' as ' S sees that A is F ' , this assumes that S 's seeing of A is a conscious , inferential perception . But many of our perceptual acts are unconscious and non-inferential . Hence , though Jackson is correct that ' S sees A ' can not ( at least invariably ) be analyzed as ' S sees that A is F ' , this leaves unaddressed the analysis of ' S sees A ' as ' S sees A as F ' . And this latter analysis , ' S sees A as F ' , of seeing things in terms of seeing facts , correctly covers conscious as well as unconscious , and inferential as well as non-inferential , acts of perception . In the second place , with the analysis that all perceiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ' see ' do not govern transparent contexts . That is , it can not be inferred from the fact that S correctly perceives X as P , that if P is also Q , then S perceives Q. Ordinary language is misleading in this context . For we tend to assume , for example , that if Smith sees the thing that we know to be a tomato , then Smith sees a tomato . But this is to fall back into confusing ' seeing ' with ' looking at ' . Now , unlike ' see ' , ' look at ' and similar physical operation locutions for the other senses do govern transparent contexts . If I look in the direction of a tomato , then I 'm looking at a fruit , a tomato , perhaps an ingredient for a pizza or a portion of your lunch . But I do n't necessarily see any of these things , even if I do discriminate a reddish object as I look at the tomato , the pizza ingredient , etc. // Fundamentally , if perceiving is discriminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as , unless S possesses the concept ( i.e. conceptual resources ) of A , S can not see A except either in the sense that ' S sees that ( what we call ) A is F ' , or in the opaque sense that ' S sees A as F ' . Imagine that an aerospace engineer and an uneducated Australian bushman are both at a test site observing the prelaunch preparations to test ( what we refer to as ) an intercontinental ballistic missile . And suppose that the engineer , wishing to enable the bushman to see the object of everyone else 's attention , makes a simplified drawing of the missile as it might look apart from the bewildering mass of launch equipment , and then points from the drawing to the actual missile . Ex hypothesi the bushman has no concept of an intercontinental missile . Does he see the ICBM ? True , the bushman can discriminate an entity which we call an intercontinental ballistic missile , without possessing or acquiring the concept of an intercontinental ballistic missile . Yet granted that what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an elongated object or huge artifact or some such thing , not an ICBM . To make this even clearer , suppose that the bushman possesses the concept of a ' spearoid ' : a projectile of a peculiar spear-like shape which , because all enemies are subhuman , is singularly suited to slaying enemies ? perhaps due to certain magical properties to which enemies are vulnerable in virtue of their subhumanness . Imagine that as he initially looks at the ICBM , the bushman sees the object before him as a spearoid . To suggest that the bushman ' sees an intercontinental ballistic missile ' simply because he is looking in the direction of what we call ( can discriminate as ) an ICBM , is , by parity of reasoning , effectually to suggest that the aerospace engineer sees a spearoid . But of course he does not . But if we do not say that engineers , who lack the concept of a spearoid , see spearoids , why claim that the bushman , lacking the concept of an intercontinental ballistic missile , sees an intercontinental ballistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the engineer does not see spearoids because he does not believe that all enemies are subhumans ; perhaps the bushman can not conceive of an ICBM because he does not believe that there are separate continents . ) Moreover , if we do claim that the tribesman sees an ICBM , we can make no sense out of the following , perfectly straightforward statement . ' Even though the bushman is looking at the ICBM , all he sees is a jumble of shapes . ' I take it , the sense of expressions of this // sort is ' from our point of view , the bushman is looking at an ICBM , launch-pad , etc. , but from his point of view , the bushman ( is looking at and ) sees an elongated oval surrounded by cylindrical shapes , etc ' . Notice that two different operators govern the two clauses in this statement . The logical form of statements of this sort is , where the speaker , S , is not identical to the percipient , P , to whom reference is made : From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' P is looking at X ' , while from P 's point of view it is the case that ' P perceives Y ' . Here , ' X ' and ' Y ' have the same referent ( and it is quite possible that the concepts of X and Y might have the same logical extension ) . But taking ' from P 's point of view ' as equivalent to ' within the conceptual structure of P 's conceptual schema ' , this logical form captures the fact that what another percipient can perceive is delimited by the logical strictures of his conceptual schema , not yours . The intentional referent of any particular perceptual state is fixed independently of how ( the as-ness ) the intentional object is perceived . But the intentional referent is fixed for the percipient by how the intentional referent could have been perceived by the percipient ? i.e. by the conceptual strictures of that percipient 's own conceptual schema . ( Hence sometimes others can be more authoritative than us about what we perceive ? for we can be mistaken about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could have perceived in terms of concepts , for possible perceptual objects , which we do not possess . ) This is basically to accept , and then extend to perception , the validity of Carnap 's now familiar claim that questions about the existence of entities of any specific type are ' internal questions ' vis-a-vis conceptual schemas . It is also important to notice the ambiguity of ' same ' in such expressions as ' the engineer and the bushman are looking at the same thing ' . ' Same ' might mean either ( a ) same , given just the conceptual schema of the speaker or ( b ) same , given the intersection of the conceptual resources of the speaker and the percipients in question . In the former sense , the bushman and the engineer both look at what the speaker ( you or I ) refer to as an ICBM , and it so happens that the speaker and the engineer share this concept . But in sense ( b ) of ' sameness ' , there is no such commonality of concepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In sense ( b ) of ' sameness ' , the only sense in which the bushman and the engineer are looking at the ' same thing ' is that there is a ' something ' which they can both ( perhaps ) pick out by ostension , and agree that they are both talking about ' that ' . Now , consider again Dretske 's original example . It would be inappropriate to claim that ' S himself sees a Lycopersicon esculentum if , when asked , S does not know what a Lycopersicon esculentum is . It is only the familiarity of the object in question that makes it seem paradoxical to say that a person can not see a tomato if that person does not know what a tomato is . While it is true that S sees what the biologist recognizes as a Lycopersicon esculentum , it is seriously misleading for the biologist to attribute to S the seeing of a Lycopersicon esculentum . For at the least this implies S 's use of these Latin terms , though it also tends ( falsely ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species and a host of related concepts . And just as it is incorrect to insist that the percipient must be seeing the ' reality behind the illusion ' ? e.g. must see an irregular , revolving figure when viewing the Ames revolving trapezoid ? and that the bushman , like the engineer , sees a rocket , so it is misleading to say that S saw a tomato ( because we saw a tomato ) when all that S ( perhaps unconsciously ) discriminated , and so conceptualized , was a reddish patch . Unless one specifies that one merely means that , e.g. the bushman is looking at what we would describe as an intercontinental missile , there is no proper sense in which the bushman is perceptually aware of an ICBM . Yet without this explicit caveat , ' sees ' is easily conflated with ' looks at ' . If that is all one means by ' sees ' when one insists that infants see tomatoes and bushmen see intercontinental ballistic missiles , then it is just a verbal matter whether or not ' see ' should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid equivocation , if ' see ' , ' hear ' , etc. are to mean ( roughly ) ' phenomenally aware of by sensory means ' , then a percipient can only see ( or otherwise perceive ) those categories of entities for which that particular individual possesses the correspondent conceptual resources . V A rather different sort of problem for the conceptualist account of perceptual experience would seem to lie in the difficulty of // explaining , when one perceives some object X , what makes X and not ( perhaps some similar ) Y the perceptual object . In ' Simple Seeing ' , Dretske suggests that we can not explain why the perceptual object is the perceptual object unless we distinguish perception from conception . He gives the following example : He imagines that he observes a near-perfect copy of a letter and takes it to be the original , on which it in fact rests . He supposes that he observes what he takes to be a smudge on the page ( the copy ) before him . ' As it turns out ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shadow ) but , as chance would have it , the original ( which I can not see ) is smudged in just the way I thought the top sheet was ? Since what I believe ( that it is smudged , that it is the original letter ) about the perceptual object is true of something ( the second sheet ) that is not the perceptual object , what I believe about what I see does not itself determine what I see . " Granting that it is not conceptualization in terms of acquired beliefs which makes the perceptual object the object that it is , what does ? Now it seems obvious , as Dretske also points out , that in such cases what makes one 's beliefs , though all false , beliefs about the copy is that the percipient stands in the appropriate causal relation to the copy . But even if in this instance the actual set of causal antecedents of S 's seeing X are , ceteris paribus , a necessary condition ( though not a sufficient condition ) of S 's seeing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wedge between perception and conception ' . What the causal antecedents of some act of seeing X are constitutive of is looking at X. And those causal antecedents might be a necessary condition of an act of perception because while we can look without seeing , we can not , barring extraordinary perceptual operations , see something without looking at it . The perceptual object of the smudge-viewer is the copy because that is what he is looking at . But the copy is not the perceptual object solely because it is being looked at ? it is only seen because it is ( also ) seen as something , for the perceptual experience is inextricably conceptualized . I agree with Dretske that ' what makes our visual experience the rich and profuse thing we know it to be is that we see more than we can ever notice or attend to ' .12 But rather than separating perception and conception , this simply amounts to the fact that // our ( conceptualized ) unreflective perceptual experience is far richer than our reflective perceptual experience . Further , in supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceptualization of perceptual experience by comparing our sensory system to a postal system . He says that the sensory system is responsible for the delivery of information , and its responsibility ends there . What we do with this information , once received , whether we are even capable of interpreting the messages so received , are questions about the cognitive-conceptual resources of the perceiver . If you do n't take the letters from the mailbox , or if you do n't understand them once you do , do n't blame the postal system.93 This talk of ' information ' and ' messages ' is systematically conceptualization-laden . Nerve impulses ( or for that mater , phosphenes ) are no more bits of information than are irruptions on a magnetic tape or the rings in the trunk of a tree . In and of themselves , these are all just physical states of affairs . Information has to do with how such states of affairs are understood , or understandable . One person 's message is another person 's puff of smoke . Tree rings and magnetic tapes only become informative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of something , information of some conceptual type ; genuine information is propositional . I have no quarrel with the basic **27;1297;TOOLONG metaphor . As Dretske says , ? To say that someone has seen X is to say that information about X has been delivered in a particular form ... ' . " Putting this in conceptualist terms , our non-inferential visual information about some X is of the conceptualized form seen as Y. But then perception , as fundamentally information-bearing , is radically conceptualized . The only way to avoid this conclusion is to suppose that there can be theory-neutral , or category-neutral , perceptual ' information ' . That supposition not only , as just suggested , rests on a misunderstanding of the nature of information , it assumes that there is , available to us , some concept-neutral ' stuff ' about which perceptual experience is informative . The denial of the latter supposition lies at the heart of the conceptualist position . Let us turn , then to that supposition . // VI A quite serious objection which might be raised against the conceptualist position is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , it might be objected , is it not exactly this brute element in perceptual experience which constitutes the ' pure perceptual ' , unconceptualized component of perception , the concept-neutral ' stuff ' about which perception is informative ? This objection can be approached by considering some remarks about perception by C. I. Lewis , who holds a view similar to that presented here of the role of the mind 's ordering in perception . Lewis describes perceptual experience as follows : there are in experience these two elements , something given and the interpretation or construction put upon it .... the criteria of givenness are ... first , its specific sensuous or feeling-character , and second , that the mode of thought can neither create nor alter it - that it remains unaffected by any change of mental attitude or interest .... The distinction between this element of interpretation and the given is emphasized by the fact that the latter is what remains unaltered , no matter what our interests , no matter how we think or conceive . I can apprehend this thing as pen or rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , discover it as paper or soft or cubical.15 Taking the given as ' that which remains untouched and unaltered , however it is construed by thought ' , Y6 I agree with Lewis that there is a given in perceptual experience . And if as Lewis suggests , the brute-fact element of any individual 's perceptual experience were itself the given , then by isolating and identifying the brute-fact elements of our perceptual experiences it would be relatively easy to determine which features of perceptual experience were unconceptualized . But the given is not , as Lewis suggests , just identical with the bruteness of our individual perceptual experience . ' Brute facticity is that in each of our individual perceptual experience which conveys the sense of unalterability ; the given is that element of unalterability which must be independent of any particular perceptual experience , because it is independent of any particular percipient . Hence the given is not what any individual percipient finds is brute // about his or her experience ; the given is only what all possible percipients would discover as the common bruteness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure perceptual ' component in perceptual experience , it would be the given , and not each actual brute fact in our experience . Every perceptual experience is a construction on the given , but only as an abstraction can we distinguish the given from the mind 's ordering of perceptual experience . First , were there no distinction between the given and the mind 's ordering , perceptual error would be ( nearly ) inexplicable as long as the percipient was carefully attentive to the phenomenological content of his experience . Second , recall Lewis 's example . Given my present conceptual schema , I can not , of course , perceive a normal writing pen as cubical or soft . But if I lacked the concept of pen or cylinder , neither could I , given that conceptual schema , perceive it as a pen or cylindrical object . As Lewis says , ' ' ' the given " for a particular sensory stimulus is ... qualitatively no different than it would be if I were an infant or an ignorant savage ' . " avage . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as brute in his perceptual experiences will often be different from what you or I , with our highly developed and complex western scientific conceptual schemas , will perceive as brute . Put most generally , each brute-fact element of any individual 's perceptual experience is not necessarily that which remains untouched and unaltered , however it is construed by any possible schema of thought . ' Hence , which features of the phenomenological content of perception will possess the element of bruteness will be partially determined by conceptualization , and only partially by the ' output ' of the sense-reception processes . For conceptualization is precisely what it is for our phenomenological fields to ? take on ' a certain look . To this it might be objected that , if the percipient 's conceptual schema importantly determines which features of the phenomenological content possess the ' brute-fact ' element , there would be little difference between perceiving and imagining . However , in imagining we can manipulate the willfully entertained hypothetical states of affairs at will . In contrast , in genuine sense perception , the brute-fact elements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is precisely this unmanipulable bruteness which conveys that sense of something being ' presented ' that , in part , distinguishes perceiving from imagining phenomenologically . And we can not manipulate these elements because the referents of this partially mind-imposed bruteness are // states of affairs which , given a specific type of ' output ' of the sensereception processes , are categorized , by our conceptual schemas , as possible actual states of affairs . This is why percipients possessing very similar conceptual schemas regarding the possible constituents of reality discover an agreement about the brute-fact features of their correspondent perceptions . This is why when we perceive what we call a writing pen , we find that just like Lewis we ' can not , by taking thought , discover it as paper or soft or cubical ' . But then just because I discover a ( for me ) unalterable brute facticity of cylindricality ( or tomatohood ) , or just because you and I agree about this brute facticity , that fact alone is insufficient to identify the given . At best , an individual 's earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' some perceptual constraint can only serve as evidence for the given ; it can never serve as a criterion of the given . The fact that we can agree about veridical perceptions with others possessing similar conceptual schemas is strong evidence that the brute-fact features of our perceptual experience have an important correlation with a certain given ? namely , that given which will be an element of the perceptual experience of any percipient with physiological processes of sense reception like ours , who experiences sensory stimuli exactly similar to that which we experience . But still , all that we can know is that there is an element in our perceptual experiences which remains unaltered , however construed by our thought : we can not know that what is now unaltered is unalterable and so identical with the given . Accordingly , even if we agree that the given is the one element of the content of perceptual experience which is not conceptualized , the identity of the given is indeterminable . Hence , neither the brute element , nor the given , is available to us as identifiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brute facticity is determinable , but inextricably conceptualized ; the given is concept-neutral , but indeterminable . Consequently , with the exception of the unisolatable and for us indeterminable given element , perceptual experience is radically conceptualized . VII Now , an important consequence of this conceptualist thesis is that persons possessing sufficiently different conceptual schemas would // live in their own ' perceptual worlds ' . Moreover , there will be no ' neutral ' pure perceptual data or brute facts to adjudicate between rival theories held within conflicting conceptual schemas.2 ' However , this does not militate against the conceptualist position . Suppose that I discover an apparent persistent bruteness , call it property b-ness , regarding a specific set of my perceptual experiences . There are two ways in which I might investigate this bruteness in order to discover whether it is a stable part of my possible perceptual experiences and an element of the ? same world ' in which I live with others . First I could , as in Lewis 's pen example , test phenomenologically whether I can apprehend the state of affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some property , c or d , which excludes b-ness . But then I can not be certain that whatever bruteness I do eventually apprehend is not just a result of how I perceive things ? i.e. is not just a consequence of my conceptual schema . Second , on the other hand I could compare my experience with that of others , attempting through our mutually complementary experiences to confirm the brute-fact element of our common perceptual experience . But a verification procedure of this sort depends for its success on shared , or overlapping , conceptual schernas . For I must assume that others use first-order observation concepts like ' pen ' and ' cylindrical ' , ' pencil ' and ' cubical ' , or whatever , and second-order observation concepts such as ' brute ' , ' recognize ' , ' infer ' , and ' perceive ' , in the same way that I do . Moreover , we can not escape this perceptual relativity by turning to some ' neutral ' observation language , one designed , say , to conform to the retinal imprints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language which is used to interpret what one perceives will be ' neutral ' only for those possessing the appropriate conceptual schema(s) about observation . Only shared conceptual schema(s) will enable the percipients in question to agree on the use of such pivotal notions as ' retinal imprint ' . Hence , only those percipients who already possess the same conceptual schema(s) about observation will thoroughly agree on ( the interpretation of ) what it is that particular perceptions are perceptions of . Consequently , whether we attempt to isolate and identify the bruteness of our perceptual experiences by the first , innersubjective means , or by the second , inter-subjective means , the supposition that we do share a perceptual world(s) with others presupposes that there are subsets of our conceptual schemas // which we share with others . Yet this does not mean that the perceptual relativity which results from differences in our concep-tual schemas implies perceptual isolation . Quite the contrary , it is just because we share large proportions of our conceptual schemas with our perceptual neighbours that we are able to share a common world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared beliefs , shared concepts and shared logic . Were it the case that we had ' pure perceptual ' experiences , unordered by our conceptual schemas , this very fact would only tend to isolate us from other human minds . Further , it would be fatuous just to assume that my ' pure perceptual experiences ' must correlate closely with yours when we have similar sensory stimuli . For I can only communicate and compare my experiences with yours ? and thereby achieve a basis for assuming a commonality of perceptual experiences ? through the medium of shared conceptual schemas . It is just to the extent that we share the concept of a tomato that we can agree that ' S sees a tomato ' . It is just to the extent that they share the concept of bird that the field naturalist who knows about Bonaparte 's Gulls , and the neophyte who does not , can successfully communicate about the objects flying overhead . It is a sameness of concepts , inclinations to belief , and so on which allows for a similarity of perceptual experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I exist in the same conceptual world as you . And we do not think alike primarily because we perceive alike ; rather , we perceive alike because , more fundamen-tally , we conceive alike . Part II World-Views and Religious Experience Visions , Pictures and Rules The Judeo-Christian mystical tradition is replete with accounts of visions . But the perceptual experiences reputedly involved in these visions are often problematic . The prophet Isaiah ( of Jerusalem ) is reputed to have seen God in a mystic vision ; St Francis to have seen Christ and received the stigmata ; Julian of Norwich to have seen Christ 's passion ; St Teresa of Avila to have seen Christ , the devil , seraphim , and various saints . Yet at least two fundamental questions immediately arise concerning the perceptual awareness involved in such visionary experiences . First , how could Jewish or Christian mystics have any reasonable certitude of correctly identifying such extraordinary entities as God , angels , and deceased saints , as figures in their visions ? And second , while Catholics , for example , see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hindus see Hindu deities : why then do mystics tend during their visions to perceive entities which accord with their expectations , entities which are usually regarded as possessing special religious significance exclusively within each mystic 's own religious tradition ? Using these two questions as a focus , I will analyse the general structure of the peculiar and perplexing kind of perception which is involved in Judeo-Christian visions of God , saints , and angels . In order to develop this analysis of the general structure of visionperception , I will assess similarities between vision-perception , on the one hand , and viewing representational paintings and ( to a lesser extent ) dreaming , on the other . I God and angels and ( deceased ) saints , which are putatively identified as figures in Judeo-Christian visions , are markedly atypical objects of perception . I think we can best understand the type of perceptual awareness involved in these unusual identifications by 47 // attempting to isolate features which visionary perceptions have in common with specific kinds of ordinary perception . One routine and unexceptional way of , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saints is to perceive these supernatural entities qua represented in western religious paintings . If one is in the Sistine Chapel and looks up at Michelangelo 's ceiling fresco , one can ' see ' God , angels , various saints , and so on . Thus , Judeo-Christian visions , and western religious representational paintings , have this in common : the percipient is putatively able to identify supernatural figures . How then is the identification of these unusual entities possible ? Now in fact , mystics sometimes describe their visions in the terminology of viewing ' pictures ' . For example , in describing her vision of the Passion , the fourteenth-century English mystic , Julian of Norwich , says : For at the same time as our blessed Lord and Saviour was dying on the cross there was , in my picture of it , a strong , dry , and piercingly cold wind . ' This suggests that , at least in some cases , perceiving and identifying the figures in a vision is something like perceiving and identifying the figures represented in a painting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision-experiences by considering this possibility . How , then , do we come to perceive the figures represented in religious representational paintings ? If we look at the Sistine ceiling , we might claim to ' see a picture of God touching the hand of Adam during the creation ' . Of course many of us would not thereby mean to suggest that there is or was a mat man named Adam . On the other hand , suppose we are out shopping with a friend . Suppose a sidewalk artist sketches our friend 's portrait while we wait . Looking at that portrait just after it is finished , and making the claim to ' see our friend 's face ' , we do mean to refer to our friend 's actual face . The first thing to notice , then , about viewing pictures is that locutions such as ' represents x ' , ' depicts x ' , and ' is a picture of x ' , are ambiguous as to whether or not x exists ( if an object ) or is actual ( if a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or might not represent or depict a real man or , if the man actually exists , real features of or facts about that man . Therefore , I will use locutions of the form ' represents x ' , ' depicts x ' , and ' is a picture of x ' , when x // actually exists or existed or ( for states of affairs ) actually obtains or obtained . And I will use locutions of the form , ' x-representation ' , ' x-depiction ' and ' x-picture ' , when no inference can be made from an appropriate usage of such locutions to the present or past existence or actuality of x . So , on viewing the Sistine ceiling , we are not necessarily committed to the existence of Adam , or God , when we say that we ' see a picture of God touching the hand of Adam ' , since we might merely mean that there is a **26;1326;TOOLONG on the Sistine ceiling . Next , imagine a representational painting entitled God and Nine Angels . There are ten humanoid figures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is God-depicting ? Following devices employed in medieval art , it might be the case that one of the ten figures is identifiable as God because it is a more fatherly type than the others , is larger than the others , is centrally located , is higher than the other figures , and is wearing a crown . How could such features act as the identifying features for the figure of God ? Kendall Walton , in ' Pictures and Make-Believe ' , has suggested that for a representational picture to be an x-depiction for a certain society it is necessary that the members of that society knowingly participate in a ' game ' of make-believe ! By the rules of the type of game which Walton has in mind , statements about a depicted entity , X , such as ' X exists ' ( where X is a name or identifying description ) and ' X is a y ' , are make-believedly true in virtue of certain properties which the picture literally possesses . And by the rules of a game of this sort , actions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count as make-believedly performing various perceptual actions vis-a-vis X. The members of the society in question knowingly participate in the relevant game of make-believe because they know that when , for example , they look at the appropriate portion of the Sistine ceiling , they makebelievedly ( and not literally ) ' see God ' , though they may not consciously think about or be able to formulate the rule(s) of makebelieve operative in a case like this . Thus on this account , by literally visually perceiving certain splotches of paint in the hypothetical painting , God and Nine Angels , in virtue of which there make-believedly exists a largest , fatherly , crowned , etc. , figure , it is make-believedly true that the viewer sees God . The viewer make-believedly sees God in virtue of a rule of make-believe to the effect that a representation of a make-believedly crowned , larger than , and more fatherly being than the beings // represented by angel-representations is a God-representation . Because such rules of make-believe operate in representational art , we feel that it would not be ' right ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical stature or younger or less intelligent appearing than the angels . In the present instance , the percipient knows which figure is x-depicting through the use of two rules of make-believe : one relating splotches of paint to crowned-figure ( etc. ) - depictions and another relating crowned-figure- ( etc. ) - depictions to God-depictions . But the determination that a specified portion of a painting is x-depicting often involves only a rule of make-believe of the first sort . I will assume that Walton is correct in this assessment of the role of rules of make-believe in making paintings x-depictions . This analysis of rules operative in viewing paintings will elucidate , by analogy , vision-perception . II Turning then to visions , there are a number of significant parallels between visions and the x-representations of representational painting . These parallels suggest that percipients see what they do in visions because visions depict entities in virtue of a set of ( implicit ) rules , rules which are analogous to the rules of makebelieve operative in paintings . ( i ) Someone who has experienced a vision of a religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does claim ) that it was a vision of an actually existent being . But he need not make such a claim . Indeed , if an educated twentieth-century person said that he had a vision , just as if he said that he saw a painting , of Pegasus or Pan , he ( ordinarily ) would not want thereby to be committed to claiming that such beings actually exist(ed) . Thus , an analysis of visions requires a distinction parallelling that between ' xrepresentation ' and ' representation of x ' for paintings . Accordingly , ' x-vision ' will be used to denote a vision of an entity the actual existence or occurrence of which can not be inferred from the occurrence of the vision , and the locution ' vision of x ' will be used to denote a vision of an entity which once actually existed or obtained or now actually exists or obtains . ( ii ) Corresponding to the make-believe truths of representational art , visions convey visionary truths . In the same way in which // make-believe truths do not express facts about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be understood in this chapter , do not express facts about a vision , such as its duration . Rather , visionary truths are the truths of a vision , the truths conveyed or presented in a vision ? for example , that there were a certain number of angels who spoke such and such words . Phrases such as ' visionary Xs ' , ' X visionally being G ' , etc. , should be strictly understood as denoting locutions with a sentential operator of the form , ' It is a visionary truth that ... ' . Like make-believe truths , visionary truths are not necessarily , though they might be , literal truths . Consider , then , those mystics who claim to have visions in which they perceive religious visionary truths . During many of their visions , these mystics must know that they are having a vision in order to perceive the visionary facts presented in the vision . For instance , in the vision during which he is reported to have received the stigmata , St Francis of Assisi saw Christ as a six-winged seraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells us that St Francis was prepared for a visionary experience of Christ . Had he not been so prepared , St Francis might well have failed to perceive the visionary facts which he did . Thus , we can imagine St Francis thinking instead , as a six-winged creature appears to float through the air toward him , that he is hallucinating a bad phantasmic representation of Pegasus . Regarding this factor of knowing that one is perceiving a vision in order to perceive the presented visionary truths , the great sixteenth-century Spanish mystic , St Teresa of Avila , says of one of her visions : Christ stood before me , stern and grave ... I saw Him with the eyes of the soul more distinctly than I could have seen Him with the eyes of the body .... It did me much harm that I did not then know it was possible to see any thing otherwise than with the eyes of the body ... Satan made me understand it to be impossible , and suggested that I had imagined the vision - that it might be Satan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not realize that she is experiencing a vision , she will not know that she is apprehending visionary truths and might think that she is only imagining things or might think that she is apprehending Y instead of , in a vision , apprehending X. // Now , one must be a knowing participant in the relevant game of make-believe in order to perceive the make-believe truths which are presented in representational art . And in order knowingly to participate in that game of make-believe , one must know that one is perceiving a piece of representational art . Analogously , the fact that in some visions one must know that one is perceiving a vision in order to perceive the visionary truths which it conveys suggests that one must be a knowing participant in a similarly operative game of rules in order to perceive those visionary truths . I will refer to such rules for visions , paralleling those for representational painting , as ' vision rules ' . In postulating the functioning of vision rules for visions , I am not suggesting that the person experiencing a vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these vision rules . Walton suggests that a painting is an x-depiction for a certain society only if the members of that society are able to determine the make-believe facts of the representation without explicitly inferring them from the relevant properties of the picture and the rules . ' Vision rules likewise may be highly internalized ; they form part of the percipient 's conceptual schema , or world-view. ( iii ) The possibility that vision rules are operative in certain visions is further supported by the fact that percipients of visions can be mistaken about visionary truths in a manner similar to the way in which viewers of representational art can be mistaken about the make-believe truths contained in the pictures they look at . In both cases , misidentifications occur even when the percipient is both thoughtful about his or her identifications and fully aware of the relevant features of the painting or vision . Thus , a viewer of the Sistine ceiling who is fully aware of the relevant features of the fresco might mistake God for a stout man by misapplying the relevant rules of make-believe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misidentification when one is fully aware of an object 's relevant features is unlikely if the object ? such as a friend 's face ? can be recognized non-inferentially . Significantly , however , these mistaken identifications also often occur during ordinary sense perception when objects are recognized inferentially and by means of rules . For example , a novice ornithologist may mistakenly identify a certain bird as a crow from the general size , the black colour , the heavy bill , etc. , and then remember that because of the wedge-shaped tail the bird should instead be classified as a raven . Two rules could be constructed // here . One rule would disjoin those sets of features each set of which is sufficient to identify and classify crows . A second rule could be similarly constructed for ravens . Crows and ravens are similar enough in appearance that the two rules would be similar , and thus easily misapplied by beginners who would be ( implicitly ) using those rules in the study of ornithology . It is the misapplication of these implicit rules which explains the inferential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relevant features of an object , this greater likelihood of misidentifications during inferential recognitions can be applied to visionary perceptions . The percipient of a vision like St Francis 's might be fully aware of the details of the vision , yet inferentially mistake Christ for a seraph which had the form of a crucified man.6 Thus mistaking Christ for a seraph during a vision , like mistaking the Sistine ceiling God for a stout man , or a raven for a crow , can well be the result of misapplying the relevant rules . Hence , rules are likely to be operative in those visions during which misidentifications ( along with inferential recognitions ) of the perceived objects occur or are likely , even though the percipient is fully aware of the relevant features of those objects . ( iv ) In many visions , the visionary world is different from the real world just as the make-believe world of representational art is different from the real world . Pegasus and Pan can makebelievedly exist in representational art or visionally exist in a vision , but they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , acts of literally perceiving a pictorial representation in certain ways count ( in virtue of the operative rules of make-believe ) as make-believedly perceiving the facts of the make-believe world in certain ways . There is a parallel for visions . Literal sense-perceptions occur during so-called ' corporeal visions ' , in which visionary objects are perceived by means of the bodily senses , and they might occur during so-called ' imaginary visions ' , in which the mystic has sensations which correspond to those produced by the five bodily senses although those senses are not causally efficacious . In these instances , the truths of the visionary world will be perceived by means of literal perceptions . This and the foregoing parallels between perceiving visions and perceiving representational art cumulatively suggest that in certain visions it is in virtue of an operative game(s) of vision-rules that acts of literal perception count as acts of visionary perception of the visionary entities . // ( v ) Lastly , we already saw that mystics sometimes even describe their visions in the terminology of viewing ' pictures ' . To Julian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add St Teresa of Avila 's statement that All my gain has come through the revelations and the raptures , in which I am nothing myself , and do no more to effect them than the canvas does for the picture painted on it.8 and St John of the Cross 's assertion that imaginary visions are like a lightning flash , which , on a dark night , reveals things suddenly , and causes them to be clearly and distinctly seen ... those things that the spirit has seen in that light remain impressed upon it in such a way that whensoever it observes them it sees them in itself as it saw them before ; even as in a mirror the forms that are in it are seen whensoever a man looks in it.9 If perceiving visions is often very much like viewing pictures , then we would expect that there would be some feature of the former which serves the same function for visions as is served by the rules of make-believe for representational painting . Vision-rules fulfil this parallel function for visions and , in doing so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propensity sometimes to describe their visionary experiences as analogous to viewing pictures . III Several observations will further clarify this notion of ' vision-rules ' for the analysis of the perceptual structure of vision experiences . It is evident that no one ' makes up ' these vision-rules which I am postulating any more than one painter contrived all the rules of make-believe operative in his own paintings . Perhaps the use of these vision-rules is in part acquired during the extensive preparatory exercises and discipleship common to the mystic tradition . Like the gradual development of rules of make-believe in art , these vision-rules would slowly evolve as the same mystic or community of mystics saw progressively more visions . Now , in representational painting , the artist 's intent neither rigidly defines what make-believe rules are operative for his // paintings , nor rigidly defines what make-believe truths can be conveyed by his paintings . The artist may , for instance , intend to have the eyes of a figure convey surprise , yet it may be as correct to see , make-believedly , awe or fear in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the artist is not sufficiently skilled , the eyes may not convey anything even like surprise . It is true , though , that certain prominent make-believe features of a painting could not correctly be considered make-believedly false by the viewer . It can not be make-believedly true that the central figure in David 's The Death of Socrates is Aristotle or a woman . Likewise , it seems implausible that for most visions there would be only a single , rigid set of rules correctly applicable to any specific vision . Two percipients of the same vision could correctly understand some of the finer details of the visionary truths differently . This means that even though the visionary truths of a vision as understood by two percipients could be different , within the Judeo-Christian tradition both percipients could be correct in the sense that neither would be acquiring beliefs which controverted the visionary truths which God intended the vision to convey . For unlike the artist vis-a-vis painting , if God intends a vision to convey certain visionary truths , then those truths are visionary truths of that vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judeo-Christian account could not allow considerable latitude in the visionary truths which God intends to be conveyed . In some particular vision of St Peter , we can suppose that God may not care whether it is understood to be visionally true that Peter is appearing in the midst of steam or that he is appearing in the midst of the clouds . In that case , either understanding of the vision would be equally correct . Also , there is another reason why the set of make-believe or vision rules will not be rigid , respectively , for a representational painting or vision . Consider two different acts , Al and A2 , of perceiving a painting or of perceiving a vision . Suppose that Al and A2 each involve a different make-believe or vision rule . And suppose that whereas one set of features , F1 , of the painting or vision is perceived during Al , a different set of features , F2 , is perceived during A2 . For the two different make-believe or vision rules corresponding to two such perceptual acts , Al and A2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets of features , Fl and F2 , could count as make-believedly or visionally perceiving the same make-believe or visionary truths . Hence , more than one set of // rules could and would be applicable to the vision or painting , since either set of rules would have the same consequences . IV With this analysis of visionary perception , we are now in a position to answer our two initial questions . First , how could the Jewish or Christian mystic have any reasonable certitude of correctly identifying the supernatural or otherwise unusual figures in his visions ? If we are fairly well informed about representational art , we can be reasonably sure of our identifications of the figures in a piece of representational painting . It is in virtue of rules of makebelieve that we might identify God , for instance , as the figure in a painting who is represented as being make-believedly crowned . Likewise for those visions in which they are operative , vision-rules would enable the mystic to be reasonably certain about his or her identifications . In this regard we can imagine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the central figure in your vision ? " Well , the other figures - they were angels - had wings and were bowing down to the central figure , and He was seated on a throne supported by several seraphim . ' The implied operative vision-rule in this simplified example can be approximated by ' **68;1354;TOOLONG are God-representations ' . In ' Visions ' , Alasdair MacIntyre says of a certain M. Ratisbonne 's vision of the Virgin Mary : ' How did he know that it was the Virgin ? Presumably only because she appeared in a Roman Catholic Church and she looked like the religious paintings he had seen . But surely such an identification is inadequate ' ? 10 First notice that two issues are conflated here . ( 1 ) How is an entity in a vision identified as X ? ( 2 ) Having identified the entity in the vision as X , what , if anything , does that tell one about the actual X ? It is the first question that concerns us here . And , assessed in terms of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Virgin Mary is prima facie reasonable . But it may be that the percipient is correctly applying the relevant vision-rules in identifying a figure in his vision as Mary when the figure ' looks like the religious paintings he had seen ' . For quite similar rules might apply to a specific set of paintings and visions of Mary . We certainly have no warrant for settling this issue out of hand . // The mystic is not necessarily consciously aware of the rules operative in a vision , but the relevant vision-rules could be constructed from the features used to identify the figures in the percipient 's vision . In general , it is the applicability of these visionrules to numerous visions ? including the percipient 's ? in which the entities in question appear , which provides a measure of certitude for the percipient 's own identifications . Now as MacIntyre 's query shows , this clearly leaves us with the question whether for any particular vision in which vision rules are operative the percipient literally perceives the entities he or she identifies . But the prelude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of X is the question of whether the vision is an X-vision . And a general answer to this prior question is that a vision can be determined to be an X-vision by referring to the relevant vision rules . " Turning to the second of our two questions , it certainly seems puzzling that mystics tend in their visions to perceive entities which they had a prior expectation of perceiving . Thus , it is usually Jewish mystics who perceive the throne of God , Catholics who perceive the Virgin Mary , Hindus who perceive Krishna , etc . But at least in the case of those visions which involve vision rules , this problematic feature of visions is no more unusual than , and is even as expectable as , the similar fact that what make-believe truths are perceived in representational art is largely determined by the viewer 's prior expectations . This can be illustrated in two ways . First , the viewers of the Sistine ceiling who uniformly see God touching the hand of Adam are those viewers who are familiar with the representational art of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of some other figure is that they are participating in the same game of makebelieve . The functioning of vision rules directly parallels this feature of pictures . For operative vision rules would account for the fact that the same entities will be perceived by several percipients of the same visionary states of affairs , even though those states of affairs are often unencountered in ordinary perception . Second , consider a percipient , P , who is used to rules of makebelieve for representational art to the effect that larger , more fatherly figures count as God-representations . Let us suppose that there is a society for which the rules of make-believe for religious representational painting include the converse rule that God is represented as younger than and smaller than angels . Now , imagine that P is shown one of this latter society 's paintings of God // and an angel . P will not at first distinguish correctly between God and the angel . Therefore , for viewers using different rules of makebelieve , the same set of paint splotches may convey two different , even opposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this unexceptional fact about paintings , we can see that participants in two different games of vision-rules could perceive different and even opposing visionary truths during the same or exactly similar visions . Broadly speaking , then , one 's prior expectations about what certain configurations might make-believedly or visionally count as are determined by the rules of the particular game of , respectively , make-believe or vision rules in which one is already a participant . As a specific example of a difference of vision-rules , Catholics and Hindus would undoubtedly participate in rather different games of vision-rules . In virtue of these different vision-rules , Catholics and Hindus will , generally , have different prior expectations about their visions and different inclinations to make certain inferences about their visions . These differences of expectation and inclination will help account both for why Catholics have visions of the Virgin , and Hindus have visions of Krishna , and for why the opposite rarely occurs . Were a Catholic and a Hindu to observe , for example , the same state of affairs during what each would regard as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former with her vision-rules would perceive Christ , while the latter , with her vision-rules , would perceive Krishna . This simply parallels the effect of differences of rules of make-believe for viewers of representational art . Thus , the functioning of vision-rules not only explains why Catholic visionaries see Christ , Hindus Krishna , and so on in accordance with their expectations . The functioning of these rules shows that this resultant determination of the character of visionary perception is only expectable given the parallel functioning of rules of makebelieve in our quite ordinary perceptions of representational art . V However , the issue of why percipients of visions see what they do is considerably more complex than this account of vision rules would at first suggest . For in spite of the foregoing considerations which indicate that visions often depict visionary truths in virtue of a game(s) of vision-rules , there are two sorts of visions in which // those rules can not be operative . These two types of visions can best be delineated by examining the respects in which visions are unlike the x-depictions of representational paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceived as an x-representation even though the percipient does not ( even implicitly ) infer this from the relevant features of the representation ( and from the operative rules of make-believe ) . A painter might tell the viewer that his painting is an X-representation , or it might be so labelled.12 Similarly , sometimes a mystic can know that she is having an x-vision even though she neither infers this from any of the features of her vision , nor non-inferentially recognizes that a figure in her vision is x . Yet how could a mystic thus know that she is having an x-vision , since mystics do not ( generally ) have visions in which each entity is labelled or ostensibly named by a narrator ? To answer this question it is helpful to turn again to parallels in more ordinary experience . Consider for instance the following dream.13 Ralph has a dream about Thoreau . In Ralph 's dream , Thoreau is a young girl who travels around the countryside starting forest fires . As often occurs in dreams , Ralph is noninferentially aware of the identity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who the real Thoreau was , but none of **25;1424;TOOLONG features even act as perceptual ' cues ' for Ralph 's non-inferential awareness of the dream-figure Thoreau . Now , in a dream like Ralph 's it is simply part of the phenomenological content of the dream that the person dreamed about is Thoreau . It would be inappropriate to protest that Ralph 's dream could not have been about Thoreau since Thoreau was a male naturalist and not a female pyromaniac . Ralph would not say , upon learning who Thoreau was , ' Oh , my dream must have been about someone else . ' In a similar manner , the identity of objects in a vision may be known non-inferentially and may simply be part of the phenomenological content of the vision . And , as in dreams , in certain visions x can even be depicted as having properties which are the converse or contradictory of properties known by the perceiver to be possessed by the actual x . In order to determine what sorts of visions share these similarities with dreams , a crucial distinction must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are two uses of ' vision ' . ' Vision ' can be used ( a ) to denote an experience , where the recipient can be referred to as having the vision , or ( b ) to denote an object , where the // recipient can be referred to as perceiving the vision ? i.e. there is an external state of affairs , the vision , of which the percipient becomes aware . I will refer to these two types of visions as ' received visions ' and ' perceived visions ' , respectively . During received visions there is no perceived object the details of which the percipient can scan or otherwise focus his or her attention on to the exclusion of other , concurrent details of the vision . Further , the percipient can not be more or less attentive to the details of the received vision itself , since the vision is the percipient 's experience , and such degrees of attentiveness will themselves be part of the content of the vision . As St Teresa says of one of her ( received ) visions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see whether I could not distract myself from the vision , but that failed to divert my attention .... In this respect ? differently from my other visions ? I could not turn away from it .... In contradistinction to received visions , numerous visionary objects are only seen if the percipient looks in the correct physical place at the right time , and many visions are publicly observable states of affairs . In both cases , the visions will be perceived visions , the vision being an external state of affairs which the percipient perceives.t 5 More strongly , the externality of the perceived state of affairs in perceived visions is indicated by the percipient 's ability to scan the vision visually . To take an example , St Bonaventura says of a Christ-vision which he had , that he understood certain truths ' while looking upon this vision ' .16 And Julian of Norwich implies that as she gazed at an actual crucifix held before her , she had a Passion-vision which was an object , the details of which she could look at : ' the bleeding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that while I gazed on the cross I was safe and sound ' . 17 Now , returning to the comparison between visions and dreams , notice that a dream , in which the identity of dream-entities is simply part of the phenomenological content , is a type of experience . A dream is not an external state of affairs which one perceives and to selected details of which one can exclusively attend . Consonant with this , it is in and only in received visions , where the vision is identical with the experience , that it will always be simply part of the phenomenological content of the vision that it // is visionally true that the percipient perceives the identity of some X in the vision . St Teresa reports this exchange with her confessor about one of her visions of Christ : ' If you see nothing ' , he asked her , ' how do you know it is Our Lord ' ? Then he told her to tell him what His face was like . She replied that she did not know , that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know was that it was He Who was speaking to her .... 18 It would be wrong for Teresa 's confessor to insist that she could not know that Christ was in her vision if she did not perceive any identifying features , since her vision might have been a received vision . On the other hand , it is only during perceived visions , where the vision is identical with an external state of affairs , that the percipient could literally infer the identity of visionary entities while literally looking at the vision . It is only in perceived visions , and not in received visions , that vision-rules could be operative . During some perceived visions , misidentifications of the entities in the vision can occur when the percipient is fully aware of the relevant features . This indicates that vision-rules are operative during those visions since in ordinary perception such misidentifications are likely to occur when inferences are made by explicitly , or implicitly , using rules . The obverse is true of dreams and their parallel , received visions . During a dream misidentifications of dream-entities can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in one 's dream it may be true ? that one misidentifies an object ) . While dreaming we do not literally use rules to identify the objects in our dreams . Likewise , during received visions no literal inferences would be made from the features of entities to the identity of those entities , and therefore during received visions there can be no misidentifications . Where no inferences and no misidentifications can be made , no rules can be operative . Hence , unlike those perceived visions in which vision rules are operative , in neither dreams nor received visions will there be operative rules paralleling the rules of make-believe for representational art . Another feature that dreams and received visions have in common also shows that vision rules are not operative in received visions . A Jones-representation in representational art has to be a representation of Jones as something ? say a human being , perhaps // a father , a plumber , or an Oxford don . Jones can not be depicted simply as Jones . In contrast , in dreams and received visions , a personage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as P. Thus , one might dream of meeting Beethoven , and in one 's dream have sensory perceptions of the room of the meeting , yet have none of Beethoven : in the dream , Beethoven is simply present . Similarly , a percipient might have a received vision of , say , Christ , in which only the objects around Christ are visually , tactilely , etc. , perceived . The identity of any personage represented in a painting is determined by the ( implicit ) application of the relevant rule(s) of make-believe to the physical features of the painting and to the features which that personage is represented as possessing . The difference for received visions is that there are rio perceived characteristics of the vision , and of entities depicted in the vision , by means of which entities could be identified during the vision through the use of vision rules . Consequently , for received visions the function of vision-rules will neither explain how mystics could have a reasonable certitude of correctly identifying visionary entities nor why in these visions they perceive entities which accord with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision-rules in received visions , the parallel with dreams does indicate how mystics could have a reasonable certitude of correctly identifying the entities in received visions . The person in Ralph 's dream about Thoreau is Thoreau regardless of whether or not the dream-figure possesses characteristics commensurate with those possessed by the real Thoreau ; just so , if a personage is given in a received vision as X , then the figure in the vision is X , regardless of the characteristics the figure is given as possessing . ( This is not , of course , to say anything about the real identity of any real personages whose words , actions , etc. , are represented in a received vision . ) We should keep in mind two qualifications to the principle that the identity of a figure in a dream or received vision is determined by the phenomenological content of the experience and not by criteria of identity applied to the features of the dream or vision after its completion . ( a ) If the features of a figure but not its identity are given , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the dream or received vision is over . ( b ) Both the features and identity of a figure , X , might be given . Yet , if after the completion of the dream or received vision it is determined that the // features of the figure are exactly similar to Y 's actual features , then it is proper to identify the figure as X , but X in the role of , or seen as , or as being , Y. Still , as long as an entity is identified in a received vision , the identity of that entity is the identity conveyed in the phenomenological content of the vision . Finally , besides received visions , a second grouping of visions will not involve vision-rules . Perceived visions can themselves be divided into those perceived visions in which vision-rules are operative and those in which they are not . For perceived visions during the occurrence of which the percipient only commits acts of ordinary sense perception , entities in the vision may be noninferentially recognized apart from the use of vision-rules . There also might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized without using vision-rules , but which additionally involve the inferential recognition by means of visionrules of some of the entities in the vision . As is true for all received visions , in those perceived visions in which vision-rules are not at all operative , the function of such rules will not help answer our two questions about how mystics could identify , and why they perceive , what they do perceive in their visions . VI The comparison of visions with representational art has suggested that vision rules are operative in certain perceived visions . The function of these vision-rules would provide the percipients of those visions with some certitude of correctly identifying the supernatural or otherwise unusual entities in their visions . Furthermore , these vision-rules would delimit the mystics ' prior expectations about their visions , and structure their inclinations to make certain inferences about their visions , such that what the mystics perceived during perceived visions would be determined largely by those expectations . Finally , although vision-rules could not be operative in received visions , the comparison of received visions with dreams has suggested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in so far as it is simply given in the phenomenological content of these visions . Now , if putative mystical visions of God , saints , and angels provoke any fascination , they also immediately and expectably provoke questions about their episternic reliability and import . // Could Judeo-Christian mystical visions ever provide reliable information about their ostensible objects ? And , if they could , what are the limitations on the sort of information they might provide ? The functioning of vision-rules in certain perceived visions , and the resemblance between dreams and received visions , explains how a percipient could correctly identify a particular entity , X , in these visions . But we can ask about any specific vision of either type : is the actual X literally perceived ? Again , operative vision-rules explain why , during perceived visions , percipients often perceive an entity , X , which they expect to perceive . But for a particular perceived vision , what information is thereby conveyed about the actual X ? In sum , when , if ever , are visionary truths also literal truths ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , the question of whether visionary truths are also literal truths would have to be decided separately and anew for each vision ? a project far beyond the scope of this chapter . Yet , the analysis of the function of vision-rules should provide a foundational step in elucidating the structure of perception in mystic visions . It should enable us more clearly to address these difficult empirical questions about the epistemic reliability and import of specific mystic visions . At the least , in view of the function of vision-rules , we need neither be puzzled as to how mystics could ever have any reasonable certitude of correctly identifying the extra-ordinary entities in their visions , nor think , as is often supposed , that the veracity of the information which visions might convey is impugned solely because mystics tend to see entities which accord with their expectations . 4 Conceptual Relativism and Religious Experience Relativism has emerged as a central and powerful element within theology in this century . Theological relativism is part of the larger fabric of the relativist orientation which has become common in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the work of philosophers of science like Thomas Kuhn , as well as in society at large . But theological relativism is not a mere patchwork of relativistic movements in other disciplines . It has its own lineage of whole cloth , traceable through H. R. Niebuhr and Ernst Troeltsch , Friedrich Schleiermacher and others , back to the sceptical attitude toward absolutist religious authority and dogma which was a legacy of the sixteenth-century Reformation . Moreover , the conditions for theological relativism are latent in the very enterprise of theology . As Paul Tillich points out , ' Theology moves back and forth between two poles , the eternal truth of its foundation and the temporal situation in which the eternal truth must be received . " Theology is always compelled to address the present . But more recently this concern has been coupled with an acute historicist sense of past and present differences among the enculturated patterns of human thought to which ? and out of which ? theology must speak . Thus H. R. Niebuhr remarks , ' in every work of culture , we relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluations , deal with relative values ... ' . As a result , some form of conceptual relativism has often been accepted in modern theology . In general , conceptual relativism is the view that what is true depends on a society 's conceptual schema(s) ? that is , depends on those cognitive resources , principally concepts , beliefs , and their interrelationships , which the members of any given society bring to experience , thereby ordering their ' world ' . Rephrased then , conceptual relativism is the epistemological position that the truth of statements3 is relative to the conceptual schema(s) from within which they are formulated 67 // and/or assessed . Expressed in theology as theological relativism , this is the view that what is religious truth within one period of church history , or within one religious society , is false or merely mythological within another period or society , and vice versa . This view is usually derived from the historicist recognition that , for example , the thought-worlds of the first-century church and of the twentieth-century church , like that of many Christians and that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wholly , incommensurate . Yet on a conceptual relativist view about religious belief , each body of religious beliefs , though incompatible with contrasting bodies of religious belief , can be in itself a proper view of reality . For it is an important consequence of a conceptual relativist view that there is a distinct conception or set of conceptions of reality , corresponding to each conceptual schema . Thus in a certain sense , those possessing one conceptual schema live in a different world ? i.e. , reality is different for them ? than those possessing a different conceptual schema . And on this position it would be improper to employ one such **26;1451;TOOLONG notion of reality , in order to criticize the view of reality expressed or expressible within another schema , as simply being false . Applied to religion , this would mean that each set of religious beliefs is to be judged internally according to its own internally consistent standards . ( It need not follow that different sets of religious beliefs are mutually utterly exclusive . Incompatible sets of religious beliefs might still share certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) I think that a conceptual relativist epistemology of the sort I have just described is , in general , intelligible , and I think that some version of conceptual relativism can be defended ( though I will not attempt such a defence in this paper ) . ' But even allowing that the general epistemological position of conceptual relativism is intelligible , and further defensible , when a theist , and particularly when a theologian , accedes to conceptual relativism , a particularly acute and important issue arises . If conceptual relativism is accepted , does this allow for any possible way of avoiding enculturated , relative conceptions , so that one could achieve an absolute understanding of or insight into the nature and acts of God ? This issue arises for theological relativism because it seems to be part of the very point of doing theology to attempt to provide a better understanding of the truth about God and His acts ? what Tillieh refers to as ' the eternal truth ' which is the foundation of theology . // And this issue is acute because the acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the project of achieving a better understanding of the reality denoted by ' God ' , a reality presumed to be self-subsistent and objectively real . Now it certainly seems as if there should be some possible means of evading the relativizing effects of our conceptual schemas and achieving an absolute insight into the nature and acts of God . And the obvious candidate which presents itself is religious experience . Would not experiences of God , if veridical , provide precisely the sort of direct and absolute insight needed ? Friedrich Schleiermacher , the great nineteenth-century theologian , gave seminal expression both to the issue of relativism vs absolutism in theology , and to this type of appeal to religious experience . Regarding relativism , Schleiermacher holds that while true religion concerns absolutes , particular religions are ' a product of time and history ' : " they are human institutions , subject to the vicissitudes of cultural context and changes of human perspective over time . Within this dichotomy , theology , while attempting an absolute view of God , is firmly embedded in the category of enculturated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solution to this difficulty , Schleiermacher suggests that religious experience itself provides an understanding of the divine which is unaffected by relativism . In particular , he thinks that an ' immediate consciousness of the Deity ' ? that is , a pure experience which does not involve conceptualizations , and an immediate experience that does not involve any mind-dependent inferences ? will circumvent the relativity of our human conceptions . The question I will address in this chapter , then , is this : in the face of conceptual relativism , can such an appeal to religious experience solve the relativist ? absolutist tension in theology which Schleiermacher exposes ? I will first assess Schleiermacher 's own analysis and utilization of religious experience . I will then turn to the more recent attempts of Martin Buber to base true piety on direct religious experience . After arguing that both these attempts fail , I will analyse the more extreme claim , which is sometimes made about the Christian mystical tradition , that special , profound mystical experiences can provide an absolute understanding of God . Regarding mysticism proper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then assess the view that ineffable mystical experiences could provide insight into God 's nature and acts . // I In his effort to explicate religious experience as a means for an absolutist understanding of the divine , Schleiermacher begins by focusing on ' immediate self-consciousness ' ? i.e. awareness apart from any inferring or conscious reflection . He moves from an analysis of ordinary instances of such awareness to the ( like ) awareness which is the experience of God . He argues that in every ordinary instance of immediate self-consciousness there are two elements : a ' feeling of freedom ' ? that is , a feeling of one 's activity , that one can act upon and manipulate the world ? and a ' feeling of dependence ' , which is a feeling of receptivity , that there is a factor besides the self which affects oneself.6 Conjoined , these two factors give one the sense of reciprocity , of a mutual interchange with the world . Thus , I am aware of my effect on the table on which I write , the pen that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Schleiermacher then distinguishes a third type of self-consciousness , the ' feeling of absolute dependence ' . Whereas we can never have a feeling of absolute freedom , absolute dependence ' is the consciousness that the whole of our spontaneous activity comes from a source outside of us ' . Schleiermacher concludes that ' the whence of our receptive and active existence is implied in this selfconsciousness and is to be designated by the word " God " ... this is for us the original signification of that word ' . ' Thus , Schleiermacher identifies the experience of relation with God with the feeling of absolute dependence , and suggests that ' any further content of the idea of God must be evolved out of this fundamental import assigned to it ' .8 There are two difficulties with Schleiermacher 's procedure . First , even if he is correct that all humans have the feeling of absolute dependence ? always as a background tone or feeling , often remote and unnoticed ? it does not follow that there is an objective ' whence ' which is the source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ) . Schleiermacher tends to infer the ontological fact of God 's existence from the ( putative ) phenomenological fact of the feeling of absolute dependence . But this runs the danger of confusing phenomenology with ontology , of confusing the way things appear with the way they are . Towers at a distance may ( phenomenologically ) look round , but in fact be square ; limbs may seem ( phenomenologically ) to itch , but may in fact ( in cases of phantom limb ) not even exist . And the experience // of a fictitious , dreamt chair , may phenomenologically be exactly similar to that of a particular experience of a real chair . Feelings and sensations , however powerful and profound , whether of the mundane or the divine , are no indubitable warrant for ontological claims ( though this is not to deny that the phenomenological content of our experiences is , in and of itself , evidence , and may become convincing evidence , for our knowledge of the world ) . Second , Schleiermacher 's procedure will not succeed in avoiding relativism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of God . Now he notes in The Christian Faith that his position is ' intended to oppose the view that the feeling of dependence is itself conditioned by some previous knowledge about God ' .9 For as he proposes earlier in On Religion , since the religious feeling ( on his analysis ) is pure , non-inferential and non-conceptual , it is ' raised above all error and misunderstanding ' . t0 If one makes no inferences , uses no enculturated concepts whatsoever , and imposes none of one 's own intellectual baggage of prejudice or point of view , then surely , so it would seem , one could achieve an immediate and absolute understanding of the object of one 's awareness . However , a pure perceptual state of awareness is not possible . II During our perceptual experiences , it seems as if certain objects or states of affairs confront us and resist us , despite our best efforts to perceive them otherwise . Thus , our perceptual experiences have a certain bruteness . It is this bruteness which Schleiermacher refers to as the ' feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject with an Other ' . And it might be supposed that it is precisely such brute elements in experience which constitute the ' pure perceptual ' components , independent of the mind 's ordering , and indicative of those independent objective states of affairs which confront us and comprise ' the world ' . Our relativized interpretations of the world are one thing ; the bruteness of the world itself is quite another . As C. I. Lewis , following this line of reasoning , says about perceptual experience : there are in experience these two elements , something given and the interpretation or construction put upon it .... the criteria of givenness are ? first , its specific sensuous or feeling-character , // and second , that the mode of thought can neither create nor alter it ? that it remains unaffected by any change of mental attitude or interest .... The distinction between this element of interpretation and the given is emphasized by the fact that the latter is what remains unaltered , no matter what our interests , no matter how we think or conceive . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I can not by taking thought , discover it as paper or soft or cubical . " In so far as the mind does order perceptual experience , let us call that ordering ' conceptualization ' . If , with Lewis , we understand the given as ' that which remains untouched and unaltered , however it is construed by thought ' , 12 I agree with Lewis that there is a given in perceptual experience . Now if , as Lewis suggests , the brute-fact element of any individual 's perceptual experience were itself the given , then by isolating and identifying the brute-fact elements of our perceptual experiences it would be relatively easy to determine which features of perceptual experience were unconceptualized . And it might seem that we could thus determine that the feeling of absolute dependence is one such unconceptualized brute-fact element . But the given is not , as Lewis suggests , simply identical with the bruteness of our individual perceptual experiences.13 I agree with Lewis that every perceptual experience is a construction on the given , but only as an abstraction can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience . True , were there no distinction between the given and the mind 's ordering , perceptual error would be ( nearly ) inexplic-able as long as the percipient was carefully attentive to the phenomenological content of his or her experience . But recall , for instance , Lewis 's example . Given my present conceptual schema , I can not , of course , perceive a normal writing pen as cubical or soft . But if I lacked the concept of pen or cylinder , neither could I , given that conceptual schema , perceive it as a pen or cylindrical object . As Lewis says , " ' the given " for a particular sensory stimulus is ... qualitatively no different than it would be if I were an infant or an ignorant savage ' .14 But unlike the given , the brute element(s) in what an infant or an ' ignorant savage ' will perceive will often be different from what you or I , with our highly-developed and complex Western scientific conceptual schemas , will perceive as brute . Put most generally , each brute-fact element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which remains untouched and unaltered , however it is construed by any possible schema of thought . Hence which features of the phenomenological content of experience will possess the element of bruteness will be partially determined by conceptualization . For conceptualization is precisely what it is for our phenomenological fields to ' take on ' a certain look or feel.15 Consequently , if the feeling of absolute dependence is a brute element of experience , it is subject to conceptualization , and so subject to conceptual relativism . But perhaps the feeling of absolute dependence is not a brutefact element of experience . And in fact for Schleiermacher to suggest that the ( pure ) feeling of absolute dependence is not itself ' conditioned by some previous relativized knowledge about God ' is effectually for him to suggest that the feeling of absolute dependence is a given element . For brute facticity is that in each of our individual perceptual experiences which conveys the sense of unalterability , the given is that element of unalterability which must be independent of any particular experience , because it is independent of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual percipient finds is brute about his or her experience ; the given is only what all possible percipients would discover as the common bruteness of their collective experiences . So if anything is the ' pure perceptual ' , unconceptualized component in experience , it would be the given , and not each actual brute fact in our experience . However , identifying the feeling of absolute dependence as a given element , rather than as a mere element of brute facticity , will not resolve Schleiermacher 's difficulty . For the given can not be identified with certitude . When we perceive what we call a writing pen , we find that just like Lewis we ' can not , by taking thought , discover it as paper or soft or cubical ' . But then just because I discover a ( for me ) unalterable brute facticity of cylindricality , or just because you and I agree about this brute facticity , that fact alone is insufficient to identify the given . At best , an individual 's earnest attempt , but utter failure , to ' strip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the given ; it can never serve as a criterion of the given . And from the fact that we can agree about veridical perceptions with others possessing similar conceptual schemas , all we can infer is that there is an element in our collective experiences which remains unaltered however construed by our thought : we can not know that what is now unaltered is unalterable and so identical with the given . // In conclusion , if the feeling of absolute dependence is given , and so unconceptualized , we could not know which brute elements of our states of self-consciousness are identical with that given . Yet if the feeling of absolute dependence is simply understood as a brutefact element of our states of self-consciousness , we could not know that it is merely how we , with our conceptual schema(s) , apprehend God . We could not know whether this feeling was just a product of our conceptualized , prior understanding of God . So whether as given , or as a mere brute element of experience , we could not know if the feeling of absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is construed by any possible schema of thought . Setting aside then both Schleiermacher 's intention to identify the feeling of absolute dependence as given ( for then unapprehendable with certitude ) , and the notion that it is a brute-fact element of experience , consider the third alternative that the feeling of absolute dependence is itself an experience . Schleiermacher suggests that the feeling of absolute dependence is bare of human construction since ' what we feel and are conscious of in religious experience is not the nature of things , but their operation upon us ' .16 Schleiermacher is surely right about this . For instance , when I have experiences of tables and tomatoes , ships and sealing wax , I am not ( ordinarily ) aware of the essence of these things . I usually perceive tomatoes as things to eat , and tables as things to eat them on ; not tables qua tables and tomatoes qua tomatoes . So the object of religious experience(s) is no different in this regard than the object of any of our other more common experiences . But to experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even be consciously aware of the entity , X , experienced as something . Yet experiencing fundamentally involves discrimination . And to discriminate , there must be something as which the apprehended state of affairs is discriminated . Every experience , then , is conceptualized . " And if the feeling of absolute dependence is a genuine experience , it too must be conceptualized . Therefore , on the one hand , the very feeling of absolute dependence will be subject to the relativizing effect of the percipient 's conceptual schema . For ' absolute ' , ' dependence ' , and even a bare ' feeling ' are all conceptualizations ( and I do not mean that they are afterwards interpreted via concepts , though this might additionally occur ) . Thus Schleiermacher will fail to avoid conceptual relativism , for there will be no unconceptualized experience on which to // base absolute truth-claims . It may be difficult , extremely difficult , to capture the subtle and heretofore unusual aspects of our experiences . But if we have experienced some state of affairs ( call it X ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articulate that experience , in however rudimentary a fashion , since that X was , necessarily , experienced as something , Y. On the other hand , not only are experiences themselves conceptualized , but the relativistic manner in which they are ( often unconsciously ) conceptualized is reflected in the relativistic manner in which they are consciously articulated . Schleiermacher admits that while the religious person 's experience of the Deity constitutes true piety , ' to which idea of God he will attach himself depends purely on what he requires it for ... ' .18 We need only consider a few of the available conceptions of the divine to see the difficulty here : Spinozan Pantheism , Whiteheadian Pantheism , Humean Deism , and Thomist Trinitarianism are all mutually incompatible conceptions . Now a conceptual relativist can argue that each of these conceptions of God is true relative to the corresponding conceptual schema(s) . Schleiermacher himself seems to accept this sort of relativism about religions . Yet because experience itself is conceptualized , on a Schleiermachian approach it is those very conceptualized experiences themselves which become the principal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explicitly articulated theological conceptions of the divine . Thus for a position like Schleiermacher 's , which founds theology on religious experience and attempts to avoid prior , relative notions of the divine , what begins prima facie as the problem of the relativity of theological conceptions turns out to be indicative of an underlying problem of the unavoidable relativity of primary religious experience . III But perhaps this conclusion is too hasty . Schleiermacher contends that the not ion of God as a distinct entity is not part of the experience of absolute dependence per se , but one way of expressing the import of that experience . Thus it might be argued that it is only the attempt to reify God objectively which involves concepts , while the actual contact or confrontation which one has with God in the feeling of absolute dependence , or some other genuine religious experience , is not itself conceptualized. // Martin Buber pursues exactly this line of thought . Buber 's fundamental insight is that there is a radical difference between relating to a thing and relating to a person in address . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our conceptualized ( and relativized ) ways of perceiving and interacting with things do not properly apply to relating to God . In I and Thou Buber argues that humans have two basic attitudes toward the world . Ontologically there is one world , but phenomenologically there are two ' worlds ' - viz. , the world of experience , which he denotes with the locution ' I-it ' , and the world of relation , denoted by ' I-thou ? . The ' I-it ' experience is our common experience of objects in which there are two entities , the self and the object experienced , and in which the object in question is mediated through the manner in which it is cognized or acted upon . Thus , the ' I-it ' experience involves the perception of the object as a discrete , bounded entity , and it involves the possibility of manipulation of the object . In contrast , the ' I-thou ' relation does not ( phenomenologically ) involve any objects ( either the self or an other ) . It is an encounter , a direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I-it ' marks an experience of something , ' I-thou ' marks a reciprocity , a moment of confrontation . For Buber , though God ( the Eternal Thou ) is addressed and confronted in every ( ordinary ) ' I-thou ' relation , unlike other persons God can never serve as an object in an ' I-it ' experience.19 This leads Buber to reject Schleiermacher 's notion that we can infer that God is experienced in the feeling of absolute dependence.20 On Buber 's view , it is not as if God could be inferred from anything - say from nature as its cause , or from history as its helmsman , or perhaps from the subject as the self that thinks itself through it . It is not as if something else were ' given ' and this were then deduced from lt.z ' Thus to attempt , as Schleiermacher does , to make objective statements about God as the person involved in the ' I-thou ' relation , is erroneously to treat an unobjectifiable thou as an ' it ' . Human conceptualizations of God might be inherently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficient anyway . Buber 's denial here of the possibility of natural theology - i.e. the possibility of arriving at theological truths by reason alone - and of // the possibility of actually knowing God ( though one can relate to God ) , is seriously defective . In the first place , one could not know that one was in a relationship with God unless one had some idea , however rudimentary , of the nature of God . Perhaps to countenance any conception of God is to leave oneself susceptible to the relativity of all enculturated thought . But be that as it may , to attempt ( implicitly ) to identify God merely as ' that in which I am in relation in the " I ? thou " relation with the Eternal Thou ' is vacuously tautological . In the second place , Buber 's position is self-stultifying . In saying that God can not be treated as an it , Buber himself treats God as an it : By its very nature the eternal You can not become an It ; because by its very nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even within the measure of the immeasurable and the limit of the unlimited ; because of its very nature it can not be grasped as a sum of qualities that have been raised to transcendence ... 22 What warrant could Buber have for this claim ( excluding direct divine revelation , a view which I will assess shortly ) ? There are two possibilities . This view of the nature of God might be a presupposition in metaphysics . But then we need not accept it without further argument . And even if we do accept it as a thesis in metaphysics , it quite clearly employs concepts ( in Buber 's terminology , it is within the ' I ? it ' realm ) . Or , this view of the nature of God might be ( despite Buber 's denial ) an inferential conclusion from the phenomenology of the ' I ? Thou ' relation . In that case , either Buber supposes that what appears to be the case must be the case , thus confusing phenomenology with ontology , or he is depending on what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about reality . And in the latter instance , Schleiermacher could , for example , counter that he has made the same sort of inferential judgement , except that Schleiermacher concludes that we can properly say that God possesses certain infinite attributes . But in any event , Buber has again provided a conception of the nature of God which will be as subject to the relativizing effect of enculturated perceptions , concepts , inclinations , etc. , as is any other conception . However , though Buber 's position thus fails to escape the problem of conceptual relativism , it raises two issues which remain // to be addressed . First , might a direct revelation from God during a mystical vision avoid the problem of relativism ? Second , Buber holds that the ' I ? Thou ' relation with the Eternal Thou is ineffable ? that it is unconceptualizable , though it provides insight . Could ineffable mystical experiences provide an absolute insight into the nature of God ? IV Focusing first on mystical visions , could a mystical vision provide an absolute insight into the divine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first step , it should be noted that in the mystic literature there are two uses of ' vision ' . ' Vision ' can be used ( a ) to denote an experience , where the recipient can be referred to as having the vision , or ( b ) to denote an object , where the recipient can be referred to as perceiving the vision ? i.e. there is an external state of affairs , the vision , of which the percipient becomes aware . I will refer to the two types of visions as ' received visions ' and ' perceived visions ' , respectively . During received visions there is no perceived object the details of which the percipient can scan or otherwise focus his or her attention on to the exclusion of other , concurrent details of the vision . The vision is the percipient 's experience . In contradistinction to received visions , numerous visionary objects are only seen if the percipient looks in the correct physical place at the right time , and many visions are publicly observable states of affairs . In both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision being an external state of affairs which the percipient perceives . Even more strongly , the externality of the perceived state of affairs in perceived visions is indicated by the percipient 's ability to scan the vision visually . To take an example , Julian of Norwich implies that as she gazed at an actual crucifix held before her , she had a vision which was an object , the details of which she could look at : ' the bleeding of Christ continued and could be seen by attentive eties .... I knew that while I gazed on the cross I was safe and sound . ' 2 Let us examine perceived visions first . Suppose that a mystic purports to perceive God by means of sensory perceptions , or to hear God speak through auditory ' mystical locutions ' , during a vision . Could God thus directly reveal Godself , or truths about // Godself , and so enable the mystic to circumvent enculturated and relativistic patterns of thought and perception ? Clearly , to the extent that mystical visions involve genuine sense perception , to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ordinary sense-perception . And just as ordinary senseperception is thoroughly conceptualized , the phenomenological content of perceived visions will be thoroughly conceptualized . As already noted , a genuine act of perception minimally involves the discrimination of a discrete ' something ' , X. Now , this might involve the differentiation of the perceived entity , X , from its environmental field , or as is shown by the case of perceiving only a uniform surface , this discrimination might not involve the specific differentiation of X from a background . Yet whether or not one is aware of other entities composing a definite and contrasting environmental field , some X is discriminated . And to discriminate X is to discriminate X as something ? however indefinite or amorphous . Hence to perceive X is to perceive X as something . However , to perceive as is to categorize ( even if unconsciously and unreflectively ) . And this applies to perceived visions . Isaiah ( of Jerusalem ) records a perceived mystical vision as follows : In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train filled the temple . Above him stood the seraphim ; each had six wings ... And one called to another and said : ' Holy , holy , holy is the Lord of hosts ; the whole earth is full of his glory . ' ... And I said : ' Woe is me ! ... for my eyes have seen the King , the Lord of hosts ! ' ( Isaiah 6:1 ? 3 , 5 RSV ) In this vision , Isaiah discriminates the central visionary object from a background of seraphim , the surrounding temple , etc . And Isaiah discriminates that visionary object as something ? viz. , as a manlike figure , as enthroned , as uttering words to him ( Isaiah 6:6-13 ) . These are all conceptualizations . That is , in the account , Isaiah ( perhaps unconsciously ) perceives God in terms of the categories of thought and belief which he already possesses : king , enthroned , and so on . Without these concepts , Isaiah could not have had the experience which he did , for then he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as enthroned . For since there are no ' pure perceptual experiences ' apart from the mind 's ordering , the // possession of concepts is a necessary condition of all perceptual experience . For , once again , to perceive is to perceive as , and to perceive something as X the percipient must possess the appropriate conceptual resources to understand Xness.2b Against this ' conceptualist position ' , that the possession of concepts is a necessary condition for perceptual experience , Fred Dretske has argued , ' what makes our visual experience the rich and profuse thing we know it to be is that we see more than we ever notice or attend to ' .27 The same sort of point could be raised regarding the mystic 's perceived vision : surely the richness of the mystical experience is not to be limited to whatever the mystic might tell us about his or her experience . But all this shows is that our ( conceptualized ) unreflective perceptual experience is far richer than our ( conceptualized ) reflective perceptual experience . The mystic may never be reflectively aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Further , in supporting his own anti-conceptualist view , Dretske inadvertently brings out the total conceptualization of perceptual experience by comparing our sensory system to a postal system . He says that the sensory system : is responsible for the delivery of information , and its responsibility ends there . What we do with this information , once received , whether we are even capable of interpreting the messages so received , are questions about the cognitive-conceptual resources of the perceiver . If you do n't take the letters from the mailbox , or if you do n't understand them once you do , do n't blame the postal system.28 This talk of ' information ' and ' messages ' is systematically conceptualization-laden . Nerve impulses ( or for that matter , phosphenes ) are no more bits of information than are irruptions on a magnetic tape or the rings in the trunk of a tree . In and of themselves , these are all just physical states of affairs . Information has to do with how such states of affairs are understood , or understandable . Tree rings and magnetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ configurations to be indicative of something . Genuine information is information about something , information of some conceptual type ; genuine information is propositional . I have no quarrel with the basic **27;1479;TOOLONG metaphor . As Dretske says , ' To say that someone has seen X is to // say that information about X has been delivered in a particular form ... ' . Putting this in conceptualist terms , our non-inferential visual information about some X is of the conceptualized form seen as Y. But then , perception , and the perceptual aspects of perceived visions , are fundamentally information-bearing , and hence are radically conceptualized . The only way to avoid this conclusion is to suppose that there can be theory-neutral , or category-neutral , perceptual ' information ' . That supposition not only , as just suggested , rests on a mis-understanding of the nature of information ; it assumes that there is available to us some concept-neutral ' stuff ' about which perceptual experience is informative . But that reverts to the suggestion that there are ' pure ' , potentially knowable components to perceptual experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unknowable given , there are no pure , unconceptualized elements in experience . The brute facticity of our perceptual experiences , whether I am viewing a writing pen or having a ( perceived ) vision of God , is the bruteness of my experience , mediated via my conceptual schema . The mystic can not know that what appears unalterable in his or her visionary experience is ultimately unalterable ? that is , would be so perceived by any percipient no matter what the conceptual structure of his or her conceptual schema(s) . Hence perceived visions could not provide an absolute , unconceptualized insight into the nature or acts of God which avoids conceptual relativism . Still , if the phenomenological content of perceptual experience is inextricably wedded to the conceptual structure of the percipient 's conceptual schema , it might be supposed that it is by means of received visions instead that the mystic could evade the relativizing effect of one 's conceptual schema . For received visions do not involve literal sense perceptions , though ( usually ) they are transmitted in terms of sensory images . 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first difficulty is a general one affecting the epistemic reliability of any type of vision , but I will consider it now vis-a-vis received visions . Mystics themselves are frequently apprehensive about whether their visions are veridical . Within the Christian mystical tradition there have been two traditional tests of veridical-ity . Nelson Pike has identified the first as the ' spiritual-effects test ' 31 This is the principle that visions which are indeed produced by God result in positive spiritual effects , such as feelings of joy , love , // and quietude , and are conducive to a spiritual life , one of humility , moral rectitude , etc . The second test , which Pike refers to as the ' Scripture-dogma test ' , is the principle representatively enunciated as follows by St Teresa of Avila : as far as I can see and learn by experience , the soul must be convinced that a thing comes from God only if it is in conformity with Holy Scripture ; if it were to diverge from that in the least , I think I should be incomparably more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously was that it came from God , however sure I might have felt of this.32 Working with Pike 's distinctions , George Mavrodes offers an insightful analysis of the ultimate hopelessness of attempts like Teresa 's to give criteria for the veridicality of visions.33 As Mavrodes points out , precisely the same sort of difficulties , e.g. deception by the devil , which concern Teresa , would affect the ' Scripture-dogma ' and ' spiritual effects ' tests , as would affect the original purported content of the vision in question . For once doubt about the origin and hence the veridicality of a vision has been raised , it is of course possible that a non-veridical vision be attended by positive spiritual side-effects , and possible that the content of a particular vision nowhere contradicts the alreadyarticulated orthodox doctrine , though it in fact contains elements which would be , let us say , considered heretical were they assessed theologically ( for the first time ) . Now let us apply Mavrodes 's general point to our present concern . Suppose the ' Scripture-dogma ' and ' spiritual effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth conveyed by a vision . Unfortunately , any doubt about the absoluteness of the truth conveyed by a vision will equally apply to the correctness of application of these second-order criteria of veridicality . For visions conveying merely relative truths could produce positive spiritual effects and could accord with articulated orthodox doctrine . Hence any feeling of surety about the truth of either of these two criteria for the veridicality of visions , or about the correctness of their application in a particular instance , is just as open to doubt as the original sense of surety that one 's vision has a divine origin and that it conveys absolute truths about God . The second difficulty with received visions is simply this . Even if God is their author ( and the human recipient is not actively // involved in the production of the vision ) , a received vision can not convey knowledge of God unless the putative knowledge can ( in principle ) be rendered in propositions by the recipient(s) . And however the epistemic import of a received vision is proposi-tionalized , some schema or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concepts employed are humanly understandable , then if one is concerned about the relativity of human conception , the resultant truth-claims will still be subject to a relative , human perspective , insight , habits of thought , etc . So if conceptual relativism is acknowledged , either received visions convey no knowledge , or they ( necessarily ) convey only **26;1508;TOOLONG truths , and , in this sense , they can not provide absolute insight.34 V We saw earlier that Martin Buber holds that the ' I-Thou ' relation with God can not properly be described . God , says Buber , is ' not even within the measure of the immeasurable and the limit of the unlimited ' . Putting aside the problem of self-stultification in this claim that God can not be described because God has certain ( name-able ) qualities , let us now turn to the claim that ineffable mystical experiences could provide an absolute insight into the divine . When we articulate our experiences , we must articulate them in terms of our conceptual schemas ; but if there are elements of our experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that very ineffability remove those elements of our experience from the tincture of the relativity of our ordinary , enculturated , conceptualizations ? What is unconceptualizable obviously can not be subject to the relativity of conceptualization . The answer to this question will depend on what is meant by ' ineffability ' . In one use of ' ineffability ' , the experience is under-standable to the participant , yet since the experience is so unlike other sorts of experience , it can not be adequately explained , and certainly nok defined , to those who have not themselves had the experience.35 But this is no different than numerous instances of ordinary experience . Thus the taste of milk and the experience of seeing red are experiences of this sort , not fully expressible to those who have not had the relevant experience . The sighted and gustatorily endowed understand ' the seeing of red ' and ' the taste of milk ' , for in order to have these perceptual experiences they must // possess such concepts as ' red ' , ' milk ' , ' seeing ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to have and understand the experience of the mystic , then they too will understand the relevant concepts . In this sense of ' ineffability ' , the percipient 's own conceptual schema still ultimately provides the possibility for understanding the experience . A quite different sort of ineffability of mystical experiences is proposed by Walter Stace . Stace suggests that for both Eastern and Western mystical experiences of the Godhead or of Brahman , ' no concepts apply to them ' . ' This is related to the kind of ' pure ' mystical experience which Aldous Huxley writes about in The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell , his fascinating accounts of his experiences under the influence of mescalin . Huxley argues that the ' medium of concepts ... distorts every given fact into the all too familiar likeness of some generic label or explanatory abstraction ' . " And he evocatively suggests that , much like traditional mystical experiences , concepts are bypassed during the mescalin experience and ' the doors of perception are cleansed ' , ' everything appearing to man as it is ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever forget it ? Where the shadows fell on the canvas upholstery , stripes of a deep but glowing indigo alternated with stripes of incandescence so intensely bright that it was hard to believe that they could be made of anything but blue fire .... Today the percept had swallowed up the concept .... Garden furniture , lathes , sunlight , shadow ? these were no more than names and notions , mere verbalizations , for utilitarian or scientific purposes , after the event . The event was this succession of azure furnace doors separated by gulfs of unfathomable gentian ? Thus on Huxley 's account , except for utilitarian and scientific purposes after the experience , concepts are not directly applicable to the experience . Anything ineffable in this strong sense of Stace 's and Huxley 's , anything to which no concepts apply , could not be subject to conceptual relativism . Perhaps then , strongly ineffable , unconceptualizable mystical experiences could provide an absolute insight into the nature and acts of God . Stace bases his formulation of ' ineffable ' , that ' no concepts apply ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Godhead ( or of Brahman ) must remain utterly ineffable to the // mystic herself or himself : ' the mystic himself . .. finds his vision ineffable and unutterable . It is he who experiences the difficulty , not we ' .39 The great thirteenth-century German mystic , Meister Eckhart , holds that ' the onefold One has neither a manner nor properties ' . This would seem to support Stace 's view of strong ineffability . But Eckhart means by this that one must give up all usual conceptions of God . In mystical union it is necessary for God to enter the soul apart from ' all his commonly attributed divine names and personlike properties ' .40 It is in this sense of the inapplicability of ordinary concepts that for Eckhart knowledge of the Godhead can not be communicated . It is crucial to recognize that the mystic can not meaningfully ( semantically ) use such locutions as ' the Godhead ' if they have absolutely no conceptual content . Otherwise , a sentence like ' The Godhead is One ' would have no more meaning than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eckhart ' the Godhead ' does not function syntactically as a mere placeholder . ' The Godhead is not lower than God ' is a truth for Eckhart . Thus the ' mystic ascent ' is a path of knowledge for Eckhart , though he distinguishes it as a different kind of knowledge from common forms of knowledge . For Eckhart a conflict arises between talk about mystic union with the Godhead , on the one hand , and the more ordinary theistic language of Eckhart 's contemporaries , on the other . Eckhart holds that the soul enters the unity of the Holy Trinity but it may become even more blessed by going further , to the barren Godhead , of which the Trinity is a revelation . On the more accepted conception of his contemporaries , the triune God is the ultimate ontological reality ; on Eckhart 's view , the Godhead is that ultimate ontological reality . And whereas God is identifiable by the divine attributes , the Godhead ? the ultimate goal , for Eckhart , of the mystic path ? is ' without activity or form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between two incompatible conceptual schemas . It is not that no concepts apply to the experience ( Stace ) , or that ' the percept has swallowed up the concept ' ( Huxley ) . Rather , the conceptual schema appropriate to Eckhart 's mystical experiences contradicts portions of the conceptual schema of traditional Christian trinitarianism . This conflict becomes expressed as the claim that the mystical experience is // ' ineffable ' ? i.e. inexpressible in ordinary religious language , with its underlying trinitarian conceptual schema.92 But the mystic who , like Eckhart , claims that his or her experience is a knowledge context , is employing some conceptual schema . Even if the concept of the Godhead is a primitive ? and hence can only be communicated via ostension ? the mystic presumably understands the concept . And , once again , if ex hypothesi conceptual relativism is accepted , the fact that mystical experiences are ineffable in the sense of not being communicable vis-a-vis ordinary language , still leaves the epistemic content of the experience subject to relativism . VI One last defence of the putative absolute insight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be raised at this juncture . We have seen that the ineffability of mystical experiences can in some cases be explained in terms of a conflict of conceptual schemas , between the mystic 's talk about the Godhead , on the one hand , and ordinary religious conceptual schema(s) , on the other . Now it might be supposed , as is frequently claimed , that mystical understanding need not be amenable to the laws of ( human ) logic . Hence it might be argued that the relativity of those ' merely ' human laws need not affect the epistemic import of the genuine mystical experience . Ordinarily it might be contradictory to claim that one has non-propositional , unconceptualizable knowledge . But niceties of logic and considerations of consistency do not , so it is sometimes suggested , apply to genuine mystical experiences . For example , in Mysticism East and West , Rudolph Otto states that there is a ' peculiar logic of mysticism , which discounts the two fundamental laws of natural logic : the law of Contradiction and of the Excluded Third ' : And Eliot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mind as it relates to the phenomenal order ; hence , it is unable to affirm , without at the same time denying , what extends beyond that order ' . " But these are selfrefuting positions . To use language to claim that the law of non-contradiction does not apply in some instance is self-contradictory and defeats the purpose of that very use of language . If the law of noncontradiction does not hold universally , then it does not hold at all , // for it is a universal metalogical claim about all propositions . And if the law of non-contradiction does not hold , then the claim that it sometimes does not hold is itself no more true than it is false . Furthermore , it would be unintelligible to use allegedly rational discourse , dependent on the law of non-contradiction , to argue that the proposition expressed by the law of non-contradiction might be false . This proposal could not even be framed , and would always fall into sheer nonsense , since an argument is only valid when , if the premises are true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth of the law of non-contradiction is essential to the intelligibility of any statement , since any statement is only intelligible on the assumption that its negation is not concomitantly true also . As Aristotle observed in the Metaphysics about this ' most indisputable of all principles ' : We can ... demonstrate ... that this view the denial of the law of non-contradiction is impossible , if our opponent will only say something ... which is significant both for himself and for another ; for this is necessary if he really is to say anything . For , if he means nothing , such a man will not be capable of reasoning , either with himself or with another.45 A language game can only be meaningfully used as long as one consistently adheres to the logic of that language game given the meaning rules of that language game and the law of noncontradiction . Thus to the extent that mystics aspire to communicate anything semantically meaningful to non-mystics , mystics must be logically consistent . It is simply nonsense to claim that they employ a ' logic ' of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to claim otherwise opens one to Ambrose Bierce 's apt satirization of the nonsensical appeal to incomprehensibility which has all too often been religion 's disreputable stigma : In religion we believe only what we do not understand , except in the instance of an intelligible doctrine that contradicts an incomprehensible one . In that case we believe the former as a part of the latter ( Bierce , ' Trinity ' , in Devil 's Dictionary ) . In short , for mystics like Eckhart who regard their experiences as providing a knowledge of God , whatever knowledge is acquired must be consistently propositionalizable in terms of some // conceptual schema . And whatever conceptual schema , however extraordinary , is employed , if a human understanding has been achieved , it will ipso facto be a humanly conditioned conceptual schema . But that is to say that however the experience might be otherwise ineffable , any knowledge gained through the mystical experience will be as subject to conceptual relativism as are more ordinary forms of knowledge . Consequently , mystical experiences can offer no unconceptualized , absolute insight into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still insists that the experience is utterly ineffable , and so not subject to the vicissitudes of the relativity of our human conceptual schemas , then as William Alston has observed : To label something ineffable in an unqualified way is to shirk the job of making explicit the ways in which it can be talked about ; ... there may be something in the world which ca n't be talked about in any way , but if so we can only signalize the fact by leaving it unrecorded ' 8 VII Paul Holmer has recently argued that ' theological language has a definitive role , which is to intensify and to purify religious passion ' 49 Yet however rightfully prominent the passional element in theology and faith , there must be a propositional element in theology and faith . For notwithstanding Schleiermacher 's observation that ' Quantity of knowledge is not quantity of piety , 50 piety without propositional content is contentless passion . Hence the retreat into the supposed ineffability of the religious experience is pointless if it is viewed as a means of giving substance to religion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps appropriate that one philosopher who saw this clearly was David Hume . In the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion , Hume has Cleanthes say : The Deity , I can readily allow , possesses many powers and attributes of which we can have no comprehension ; but if our ideas , so far as they go , be not just and adequate and correspondent to his real nature , I know not what there is in this // subject worth insisting on . Is the name , without any meaning , of such mighty importance ? Or how do you mystics , who maintain the absolute incomprehensibility of the Deity , differ from sceptics or atheists , who assert that the first cause of all is unknown and unintelligible ? 51 On the one hand , we have seen that the notion of a comprehensible but ' pure ' unconceptualized religious experience is specious . Yet , on the other hand , I agree with Hume that those who fundamentally appeal to the utter ineffability of religious ex-perience are ' atheists without knowing it ' . Therefore , one must look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the challenge of conceptual relativism . For if one hopes to find a means whereby the substantive content of theology and faith can be ( in some sense ) absolute and not , in Karl Barth 's words , ' accursedly relative , 52 we must recognize that religious experience in itself offers no such hope .
