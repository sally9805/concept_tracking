Jazz life on dream street : days of drizzly twilight , long spiky nights of taking a nick off Nirvana with a piano run or a horn solo , walking arm in arm into a rainy dawn with your next sad love affair . Meanwhile , real life on ! Lawrence Street : a two-story frame house in a working-class neighborhood of Washington . The den extension and the enlarged kitchen were not built by the man of the house , Shep Deering , but by his wife , who is handy with a hammer and saw . Her husband of 35 years still works as a mechanic for the Metropolitan Transit Authority . But , says Mrs. Deering , " I 'd never marry a musician . I 've seen so many bad marriages with musicians . " <P> Mrs. Shep Deering has a night job herself  --  as a musician . She plays a fine jazz piano and sings a supernal jazz ballad . People like Miles Davis , Wynton and Branford Marsalis and Toots Thielemans play along with her . She also has a brand-new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jazz chart . You Wo n't Forget Me is the title . It may also be read as an unconditional guarantee : Shirley Horn is indelible . <P> " It 's been written that Shirley Horn is back on the scene , " Horn reflects . " Well , I have n't been anywhere . And I 've been busy . " All that busyness has n't got her the kind of wide attention she deserves , until this moment . She 's had a career for some 40 of her 55 years , but recognition , while often fervid , has been . . . well , say , finely focused . Sales on three of her albums in the early ' 80s were so slender that a persistent record company still bills her for production costs . If You Wo n't Forget Me keeps on sailing , she may actually see her first royalty check after about 30 years of recordmaking . " My secret is out of the closet now , " she laughs . <P> More precisely , Horn is front and center , but her secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what draws you first when you hear the smoky timber of her voice , the leisured elegance of her phrasing . And it 's what holds you , wondering about the magic she brings to tunes as varied as Do n't Let the Sun Catch You Crying and You Wo n't Forget Me . Says jazz critic Martin Williams : " She 's not only good and tasteful , but she also has that wonderful sense of drama that can turn any little song into a three-minute one-act play . " Horn concedes , " Well , I 'm a good actress . I 've never had a lot of pain . " <P> Having seen at least three friends fall to drugs , she 's stayed clear of anything much stronger than the Drambuie she favors , usually with a beer chaser . She 's spent most of her life playing around the Washington area , where she was reared ; she was doing a set in Baltimore just two weeks after her daughter Rainy was born in 1962 . " I was commuting , having a good time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young baby , a home to keep , a husband to cook meals for . Then when Rainy was about 11 , 12 years old , I felt she needed me . And I guess I needed her . So I slowed down a little . "
