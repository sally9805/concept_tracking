A South Sea Adventure for Handicapped Scuba Divers <p> Scuba diving in Fiji makes it seem really easy . I want to see the rest of the world from underwater ! " said Don Lively . But when Don had first arrived on Matagi , a 240-acre rain forest island in the South Pacific , he 'd never ventured below the surface of the water even though his fiancee and traveling companion , Gail Kemper , was a newly certified scuba diver . <p> On the morning after his arrival , Don headed out into a quiet lagoon for his first diving experience . " The first is always the best ! " he said , " I know I 've a few things yet to learn but I 'm ready . . . I 'm hooked ! " Don and Gall , both quadriplegic , now share an enthusiasm for scuba diving . <p> Matagi is not a destination one chooses whimsically since just getting there demands the commitment of a 12-hour transcontinental flight , followed by two inter-island " hops " aboard an 18 passenger twin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you view privately owned islands such as Malcom Forbes Island . <p> Once on shore , bare-footed Fijian men carry those with disabilities across a narrow , sandy beach where the wheelchairs are already set up . ( Not only do the Fijian carry boys transport handicapped divers , each morning the gear is set up and each afternoon thoroughly cleaned by the Fijians . ) <p> The Douglas family owns Matagi Island and with their staff of 40 , operate the resort , 11 thatched huts , called bures . <p> Despite their primitive exterior , the bures - most of them styled after the round , Polynesian type with conical roofs - are luxuriously appointed and decorated . The bures offer comfortable accommodations for two - even two in wheelchairs , like Don and Gail . <p> It 's very much like a tribal village . The bures are laid out in village pattern to ensure ample privacy for each bure . Also , shortly after dusk and again after dawn , meals are announced by islanders with drums . <p> There are n't any sidewalks here , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand to get onto the dive boat . <p> Artificial outdoor lighting has n't been adopted on Matagi . Instead , the night is illuminated by kerosene torches in the form of carved lava stone " Tiki God " heads . The torches remain lit from dusk to dawn . <p> Matagi is even more private than it initially appears because the Fijians working on the grounds toting dive gear or serving home-cooked food do n't actually live on the island . They arrive in motor boats each morning from another island then return there each evening - which means Matagi 's inhabitants are the Douglas family and their two-dozen or so visitors . However , the island home of the Fijians is not taboo to Matagi 's guests who are invited to participate in traditional native feasts and purchase souvenirs handcrafted by the villagers . <p> Aside from these diversions , this is basically a do-nothing sort of place . " there 's no night life , no shopping but it 's got great diving and very good personal attention . " <p> The dives are spectacular . Julie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has since sampled the waters of three continents , describes Matagi 's habitat as " the most abundant and diversified marine life I have ever dove . " <p> ( This Fiji vacation was a tour conducted by the Handicapped Scuba Association . ) <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Last spring , Michelle Galler took a group of divers to Australia . They dove at Cape Tribulation , where the rainforest meets the reef . Michelle , at right with Paul Ursulich who is also a quad , going to the beach to go diving .

It was founded by Jim Gatacre , who is now president of the organization . HSA has devised not only a program for handicapped students but also for diving instructors in 14 states and 10 foreign countries . Membership numbers more than 600 and the program is being taught nationally , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dive instructors . <p> The HSA provides safe , barrier-free accommodations for the disabled traveler , both diver and non diver , with an emphasis on dive travel destinations . This travel service is staffed by Michelle Galler of Colorado and Julie Mora of California , two travel agents who are both quadriplegic . They evaluate resorts or accessibility and help out together dive trips to exotic destinations such as Fiji and Australia . <p>
