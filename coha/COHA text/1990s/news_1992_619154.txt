<p> The Bush administration and the stock market bulls swear that the economic recovery is going to start any day now . Factory gates will swing open and the glad peal of cash registers will ring forth once again in malls beyond number . <p> So why are we so uneasy ? Recessions come and go , the humbled experts say , and this one 's no different . It had a beginning , a middle and it 'll have an end . Some day . <p> But this downturn has lasted so long and squeezed the white-collar professional and managerial classes so hard that as much damage has been done to national self-confidence as to the economy . Japanese jeers that we 're shiftless and no-account have n't helped . <p> Nor have the prophets of continued bad times , like the oddly named but highly regarded SJay Levy , head of the Jerome Levy Economics Institute at Annandale-on-Hudson , who said this talk of recovery is a snare and a delusion . <p> " We 'll have ongoing attrition in the economy , more businesses will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloomy outlook for people , " he said . " There has been nothing like this since the Great Depression . " <p> He does n't blame it on the national character , however . His culprit is wretched excess  --  the over-borrowing , over-building , greed-is-great ' 80s , when voodoo economists like Arthur Laffler clouded minds in the Oval Office . <p> The New York Times said Levy has one of the best records over the past 40 years for spotting economic turning points , while Barron 's merely calls his forecasts " superb . " But maybe Levy 's wrong this time . Maybe the real trouble is media hysteria caused by the bottom falling out of the advertising market , badly jarring the pontificating caste . <p> " I think the economic problems are intensifying because of all the publicity given to it in the press , " said Edward Stainbrook , an expert on crowd psychology at the University of Southern California . " A story is taken up , gets momentum and can feed on itself . That kind of attitude can create the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1,200 newspapers generates mail that these days increasingly runs to anxiety about the economy . Maybe she 's part of the problem . <p> " I 'm calling it a depression , " she said . " I feel very sad about the people who are going to be the victims of this economic collapse , which is what it will be . " <p> Said her sister and rival Abigail Van Buren , whose advice column is in more than a thousand newspapers , including The Chronicle : " People usually write about marital problems and lovers ' quarrels , and now suddenly all this mail about the economy . " <p> And yet amid the general gloom you find shafts of optimism everywhere , even where you should n't ; for example , among the unemployed . Jeff Callo is one of those who sees a glass half full where others detect a vessel half empty . <p> He quit his job as director of product marketing for Motorola Computer Group in Tempe , Ariz. , in November , with the recession well into its second year even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 months , commuting on weekends to his home in Fremont . Hardly a good time to go over the side . <p> " They had some changes in management , and it was n't working the way it was supposed to from what I was originally told . And it became perfectly clear to me that if I wanted to be where the action and success stories are in high tech , I 'd better come back to the Bay Area . " <p> Part of the severance package Callo got from Motorola , thanks to an amicable parting , was counseling from Enterchange , an Atlanta- based out-placement and transition-management agency . <p> Like others in the field , Enterchange goes great guns in times like these when the economy sheds jobs like a tree dropping leaves in a high wind . It recently opened offices in San Francisco and San Jose . Revenues for its holding company were $ 40.7 million last year , up from $ 37.4 million the year before . <p> " Typically , " said Enterchange 's John Epperheimer , who switched careers himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company will engage our services before layoffs are announced . In some cases we help with the announcement . " Its client list is heavy on engineers , marketing people and personnel executives . It expects a flood of bankers when the Bank of America merger with Security Pacific Bank comes down , putting further thousands out of work . <p> Those who get the ax are told how to conduct a job search , including counseling , resume updating and learning how to put the best foot forward in interviews . " There are a lot of rehearsals so you can be as polished as possible . " Networking is one of the techniques taught . " About 65 percent of the jobs our clients get are not advertised . " <p> " But all you have to do is look in the newspapers to see how many good companies still growing are constantly on the lookout for good marketing people , " said Callo , 45 . <p> His work with Enterchange has been helpful in more ways than just the mechanics of looking for work , skills a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flush . <p> MANAGING FEELINGS <p> " They help a person get in touch with and manage their feelings . People have a tendency to minimize them but they 're certainly there , " Callo said . Although he 's breezily confident that the right job is just waiting to be discovered , he admits to getting the blues sometimes . <p> " There 's obviously a point where it feels like you 're being rejected . Certain people do n't want to talk to you . You interview and you do n't get an offer . " <p> Like his father before him , John Wilkins , 45 , is an operations manager . As his father did in the mid- ' 70s when he lost his job at the age of 54 , the clipped and confident Wilkins turned to 40 Plus when he found himself out on the street in August 1990 . It is a volunteer organization in Oakland for out-of-work executives , managers and professionals . Times are such that it has just opened offices in San Diego and San Jose . <p> " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Wilkins . He worked for the firm 17 years , joining it straight out of Whittier College . " I hold no grudge . It was a situation rather than a person . " <p> He tried an out-placement agency and looked for work on his own for a couple of months before joining 40 Plus , headquartered on the outskirts of Oakland International Airport . <p> AWAY FROM DISTRACTIONS <p> " It gives me the option of getting out of the house and away from all the distractions , all the things I 'd rather be doing . " <p> Wilkins said he 's turned down a couple of job offers . " If I ca n't get absolutely passionate about what I 'm doing , I do n't want to do it . I had assignments in my previous work that I did n't particularly enjoy . " <p> The average job search at 40 Plus is four months , and more than 20 percent of those going through its program report a drop in salary and status . <p> Three to four people a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although Epperheimer said " the good news is everyone gets a job sooner or later , " at 40 Plus , they notice some people quietly disappear when an unsuccessful job search goes on long enough . <p> " I 'm an optimist , " said Wilkins . " and I prefer to stay an optimist . I 'm going to make things happen . " <p> Jesus Sanchez , 33 , is an optimist too , which is why he moved north from Mexico 12 years ago in search of a better life . Married and the father of three children , he quit his job as a plating supervisor for a South Bay electronics manufacturer last year to take a better one . <p> He was laid off in August and now is two months behind on his rent . <p> " This year is the most difficult year I ever had , " he said . " It 's scary right now because there are no jobs out there so I can get back on my feet . " <p> He 's getting help from the Salvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same struggling Peninsula electronics firm . <p> " Sometimes when they get a paycheck the company has no money in the bank . They 're supposed to get paid Fridays , but sometimes they do n't until Monday or Tuesday . They 're afraid of getting fired , so they have n't said anything . They think it 's better to have the money late than not to have any money . " <p> Sanchez has given up on the electronics industry . " I 'm going to go to school to become an X-ray technician or a pharmacist 's assistant . That 's more stable . But it will be a tough two years . " <p> CAREER SWITCHES <p> A lot of people are switching career emphasis . Out-placement agencies report that as many as 30 percent of their clients now mull this option , double the number that did last year . <p> " In 1984 a business magazine reported that only 1 percent of those who lost their jobs were becoming self-employed , " said Paul Edwards . He , with his wife , Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1975 , when their first best-selling book on the subject was published . <p> " The economy is fundamentally and permanently altered , " said Sarah . " Corporations in the future will be substantially reduced in size . It will have a small core of highly energetic , often bright people who will burn out at 40 . " Work will be contracted out to people who formerly would have been on the permanent payroll . <p> A lot of lawyers are in the ranks of the unemployed . " I get a lot of calls from people getting pink slips , " said Hindi Greenberg of Lawyers in Transition in San Francisco . Those specializing in business law  --  with the exception of bankruptcies , which is very hot right now  --  are particularly hard-hit . <p> " If companies are n't putting together deals or buying or selling each other , they do n't have a need for lawyers . " This contrasts with the ' 80s . " Law firms were crying for good lawyers , especially those from the best schools , who could ask for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are more lawyers than jobs . " <p> Abbi Charap and Julie DeMaestri had a flourishing events-coordination business for seven years until the souring times put an end to splashy openings , fancy corporate parties and other such affairs . They handled the opening of the San Francisco Shopping Centre , the gala that opened the Frank Lloyd Wright exhibition and the Northern California premiere of " Back to the Future " for Lucasfilm . <p> " We saw the handwriting on the wall , quite frankly , " said Charap . So they turned their formidable energies in a different direction , forming a company and raising $ 75,000 in venture capital to market novelty items . <p> HANDY DEVICES <p> The first was a device costing $ 14.95 that holds frequently called phone numbers that drivers can hang on car visors for easy consultation . <p> " We want to see it in every Circuit City , every Good Guys and every cellular-phone store in the country , " said Charap . Nordstrom and other major retailers have bought quantities of the product . " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @
