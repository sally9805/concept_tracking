<p> WASHINGTON  --  Chris Rock rules . <p> He 's everywhere  --  touting a new book , riding high after stints on the Emmys and the MTV Video Music Awards , churning out his hit HBO show , and last week , sealing a reported seven-figure deal to be in Lethal Weapon 4 . <p> With a scathing wit , this 31-year-old comic tackles the usual topics  --  money , women , politics  --  with a mock outrage that 's often aimed at black America . His Saturday Night Live character , Nat X , skewered black militants and ridiculed community adulation for O.J. Simpson . <p> His monologue usually winds up sounding almost like a right-wing commentary on society , but one that manages to sweep across race , age , class and gender lines . Howard Stern is a fan . And so is New York Times film critic Caryn James , who says Rock is " probably the funniest and smartest comedian working today . " <p> Because he 's the media darling of the moment , Rock 's on a roll . Morning TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for their covers . Newspapers want to print for the 137th time how Eddie Murphy discovered him at the age of 18 in a little club in New York . <p> Everyone wants a piece of the Rock . <p> " It feels OK , " he says , yawning in a room at yet another hotel waiting for yet another photo to be taken . <p> " It feels good . " <p> He yawns again , then perks up a little . <p> " It 's not like I 'm new or anything . I feel like I got my braces off . I 'm the girl who got her braces off . . . . Never noticed her and she was here all along . That 's what I feel like . " <p> And he 's fully aware that for a high school dropout and Saturday Night Live alum who has logged millions of hours on the stand-up circuit , now is his time . <p> " The pressure 's on me , man . Everybody 's writing , ' He 's the funniest . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . You 're not allowed to have an off day  --  especially right now ' cause nothing 's confirmed . It 's all almost . I could still mess it up . " <p> That 's the way Rock , the son of a Bedford-Stuyvesant truck driver and one of seven kids , has always lived  --  not being satisfied with himself . <p> " At all , " he says . " The deals do n't mean a thing . Money does n't mean I 'm good . Lethal Weapon . None of it . Being good means I 'm good . When I 've decided and an audience has decided . The rest of this is just hype . " <p> It 's not just hype , however , that another comedian , Tim Allen , is now making $ 1.5 million per episode for Home Improvement . Would n't Rock like a sitcom ? <p> " I 'm offered one every week , " he says , then mimics his agent : " We 've got a show for you . You 're a teacher . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Someone even wanted him to be the voice of a monkey in an animated film , he says . " I was like , I do n't want to be a monkey . " <p> He could do almost anything right now but says , " I want to do it to be funny , not to make money . " <p> And he 'd give the fame back in an instant . " My manager lives the same life I live , but he 's got a nicer house than me , gets great tickets , gorgeous women and nobody knows him ! " <p> Rock is recognized wherever he goes . " I 'm like the American Express card . " <p> And because he grew up in New York , where he still lives with his wife , Malaak Compton-Rock , who works for UNICEF , he says he tends to misinterpret fans ' intentions . <p> " People staring at you means trouble  --  I 'm going to be robbed . I 'm like  --  who 's that guy from Raging Bull ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? ' ' Yeah ! I 'm a fan . ' ' Oh . ' " <p> But all the fans and all the paychecks ( he just bought his mother a house in Myrtle Beach , S.C. ) are not enough to thwart Rock 's penchant for second-guessing himself , for getting depressed . It 's that dark side thing comedians have , he admits . <p> " A thinner-skinned person would get treatment . Anybody in show business has a thick skin . So yeah , there 's definitely emotional ups and downs . " <p> For him , it has to do with things his father , Julius , who died of an ulcer in 1989 , instilled in him . <p> " I go through this thing of : ' Am I a certain type of man ? ' I really want to be a good MAN . I trip out and get depressed when I do n't think I 'm being a good MAN , " he says , emphatically , the echoes of his grandfather preacher coming through . " I 'll be down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot of soul searching . " <p> If that sounds Promise Keeper-ish , Rock is not . He 's still looking for a religion . <p> " My grandfather preached . He kind of did it for the free parking space . If I could find a religion , I would just preach . Religions always end up against somebody . All united religions , they have a hard line on something . Hey , I think gay people are cool . I think women are equal . Hey , do I like Jesus ? Fine . You like Mohammed ? Fine . One of these days somebody is going to figure it out . Most people are looking for that . I 'm going to invent a religion that encompasses everything . It 's going to be the gumbo of religions . " <p> He also cares about being a good comic . Sometimes late at night , he 'll call up a club in New York and ask how many people are there . They 'll say , " Four  --  we 're about to close , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my way down . " <p> It 's a way to test out new material , keep him sharp , keep him humble . <p> He just caught Bill Cosby 's act in Atlantic City and raves about the elder statesman . Reports that Cosby was down on him for being X-rated are n't true , Rock says . He talked to Cosby about it after the show . <p> " He said , ' You know what , I do n't say those things because I 'm mad at you but more like a professor trying to push you on , get more out of you . ' He thinks there 's more in me , " Rock says . " So that 's really cool . " <p> And it 's even cooler when it 's coming from an idol he watched as a kid . <p> He and his friends would watch Rodney Dangerfield and Don Rickles along with the Cos . And Flip Wilson and Woody Allen . <p> Allen is " a genius , " Rock says . But sleeping with Mia Farrow 's adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds . " Do n't get me wrong , but we have no genuises . HE 's the genius . " <p> He says , " I do n't think race ; I just think funny . " <p> He 's been doing it since he was 7 . " I could watch any comedy , watch eight minutes , and tell you what was going to happen . I could map out the plot . Gilligan 's Island . Happy Days . Laverne and Shirley . Three 's Company . Pow . Pow . Pow . Knew the jokes at a real young age . " <p> But of all the comedians before him , it was the wild partier Sam Kinison , who died in a car accident in 1992 , who struck a chord in Rock . <p> " Definitely had the biggest influence on me comedically , " he says . " He was just really in-your-face , so honest , so wild . He was overboard from time to time . The drugs would do that . But so honest , man . No tricks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just total monologuist . " <p> Rock hung out with him but " never did drugs with him , " he says . " He would offer and I would say no , and he 'd say , ' More for me ! ' " <p> Monologues fascinate Rock . The words . The lyric nature of comedy . He says he does n't mean any " disrespect , " but when he wants to be creative , " I 'll take out my Babyface tape and listen to Stevie ( Wonder ) , because the writing 's better . <p> " Coming up with good material , you have to put good things in your mind . You have to have good art . You have to read the paper every day . You just have to be really conscious of what 's good art and bad art . " <p> And he 'll read the Bible . Proverbs . <p> " These bounds of right and wrong , " he says . <p> He has never really written a whole joke . He goes on just knowing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will provide him a good show . <p> Marci Klein , a Saturday Night Live co-producer who met Rock in 1990 when he started his three seasons on the show , described Rock to Rolling Stone as a " heavy thinker , very sensitive and extremely hard to get to know . " <p> True ? " Yeah , I 'm in thought a lot . I 'm just trying to be ready for the next thing . " <p> He 's already thinking about when his 15 minutes will end . <p> " No need to worry , it 's gon na happen . I understand that . I hope it does n't happen to the degree that the adulation has happened . That would be pretty bad . But it 's gon na happen , do n't kid yourself . " <p> Rock 's world is a funny  --  and growing  --  place <p> Samples from Rock 's routine : <p> On marriage <p> " Marriage is the roughest thing in the world . Nelson Mandela endured 27 years in a South African prison , but once he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busted his a - - . " <p> On O.J. Simpson <p> " If O.J. was n't famous he 'd be in jail right now . If O.J. drove a bus , he would n't even be O.J. He 'd be ' Orenthal , the Bus-Driving Murderer . ' " <p> On the O.J. acquittal <p> " I ai n't seen white people that mad since they canceled M*A*S*H . " <p> On music <p> " The Spice Girls . Ten million records sold . I ca n't find one person that 'll admit to buying one . " <p> Where to find Chris Rock : <p>  --  In a bookstore : Rock This !
