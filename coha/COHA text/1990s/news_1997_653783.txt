<p> Tom Hansen vividly remembers the " extraordinarily complicated " renegotiation of the contracts for six cast members of the NBC hit series " Friends . " He and his partner , Craig Jacobson , represented two of the stars , and they found themselves at one point in a room crowded with agents and managers  --  and other entertainment lawyers like themselves . <p> The crush of people and competing interests led him to one conclusion about the reality of television dealmaking in Hollywood . " This is like trying to plan the invasion of Normandy , " he said . " We 've got the Americans , the British , the French , the Poles  --  everybody 's in on this thing . " <p> Especially the entertainment lawyers . <p> As negotiations between the networks and the creators and the stars of television shows become more and more complex , Mr. Hansen , Mr. Jacobsen and a small group of other entertainment lawyers are taking increasingly active roles in making the deals that were once handled mainly by agents . As such , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downside that critics see in the complicated dealmaking is that shows often get on the air based on how a deal was structured  --  for example , matching a particular star with an established television writer  --  and not on somebody 's original idea for the concept of a show . <p> " The lawyers have become much more a part of the process , " said Leslie Moonves , the president of CBS Entertainment . " We now find ourselves dealing with the lawyers on a day-to-day basis as much as the agents . " <p> Behind much of the rise of Hollywood entertainment lawyers has been the elimination of Federal Communications Commission rules that once greatly restricted the number of shows in which a network could own an interest . As a result , a new television industry playing field has emerged , dominated by vertically integrated companies like the News Corporation 's Fox and Walt Disney that own both production studios and networks . <p> This concentration of power has led many producers and stars to rely on entertainment lawyers , rather than just their agents , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deal . <p> " Some agents are good at dealmaking and some are not ; some specialize in handling the talent and leave the dealmaking to the lawyers , " Mr. Moonves said . " There are now so many complex ways of making payments to people , even to the point at times where stock options are thrown in . Not all agents are going to be up to speed on all of that . " <p> Mr. Hansen , obviously , is quite explicit about the increasing importance of entertainment lawyers . " We may get ourselves into a situation where 's there no open market for people to take shows to , where every show is owned or partly owned by a programmer , " he said . Without the right representation , he said , " you 're completely at the mercy of the programming entity . " <p> Since the value of an existing hit television show has never been higher , lawyers representing the creators and stars of such shows are seeking to squeeze as much money as possible out of the networks now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remaining leverage they hold . <p> Mr. Hansen and Mr. Jacobson , partners in the Hollywood law firm of Hansen , Jacobson , Teller &; Hoberman , are among the busiest of the lawyer-dealmakers . Others nclude Ernie Dell , who represents many top television executives like Mr. Moonves and Stuart Bloomberg , the chairman of ABC Entertainment ; Kenneth Ziffrin , whose clients include Jay Leno , and Jim Jackaway , whose clients include David Letterman and the executive producers of the NBC hit comedy " Fraiser . " <p> The clients of Mr. Hansen and Mr. Jacobson include Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer from the cast of " Friends , " whom they represented in the renegotiation of their contracts last year . <p> Others have included Julia Louis-Dreyfus , whom they represented in the high-stakes showdown last spring between NBC and the supporting cast of television 's biggest hit comedy , " Seinfeld . " <p> They made lucrative deals recently for such show creators as John Wells , the executive producer of " E.R. , " Phoef Sutton , a former producer on " Cheers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop shows for CBS after delivering only one comedy , " Single Guy , " to NBC . <p> They also represent Jamie Tarses , the president of ABC Entertainment , and played an important role in some occasionally tense negotiations this summer that ended with her staying at the network . <p> In the " Friends " negotiations , the six-member cast joined together to seek a raise , only to run into intense resistance from the studio , Time Warner 's Warner Brothers , and its president , Bob Daly . " These were young stars who had never experienced anything like this in their lives before , " Mr. Hansen said . " And there was this horrific threat of a scorched-earth lawsuit that Bob Daly made clear he would initiate . " <p> The " Seinfeld " negotiations , meanwhile , involved the three supporting cast members standing together seeking raises  --  to an unheard of price of $1 million an episode . <p> In both cases , the lawyers said , NBC tried to paint the actors as threatening to kill a favorite show with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Friends ' deal , " Mr. Jacobsen said . " But everyone was ready for it the second time around . " <p> The " Seinfeld " actors came away with about $600,000 an episode , about six times as much as the " Friends " actors settled for . <p> " The difference in the ' Friends ' deal was simple , " Mr. Jacobson said . " You had twice as many actors with one-tenth the leverage . " <p> The question of leverage is at the center of the growing conflict between the vertically integrated entertainment companies on one side and the entertainment lawyers and their clients on the other . <p> Mr. Jackaway , the entertainment lawyer , also represents the Wind Dancer production company , makers of the hit show " Home Improvement . " Earlier this year , Wind Dancer sued its own partner , the Walt Disney Company , over the terms of the renewal of that series by ABC , which Disney owns . <p> Indeed , that suit is the most visible manifestation of the charge of " self-dealing " by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest issue in television deal-making . " <p> The makers of " Home Improvement " have accused Disney of short-changing the profit participants on the show  --  the creators and the show 's star , Tim Allen  --  by not allowing the series to be put up for bid to all networks , instead selling the series back to its own network , ABC . The suit contends that the show , for which ABC agreed to pay $3 million an episode , would have attracted a price well in excess of that from a bidder other than ABC . <p> " This whole vertically integrated self-dealing issue is going to completely change the way all of us do deals , " Mr. Hansen said . <p> Chiefly , he said , the lawyers expect the networks to begin inserting language into every deal creating a formula up front for profit participants . " The networks will saying going in : here 's exactly what will determine your profit participation , " he said . <p> Just how rich the formulas turn out will entirely be a function of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment lawyer put it , " I can see the formulas for the A-list show makers being something we all can live with ; but the B-list people will take a beating . " <p> The difficulties will come , said this lawyer , who spoke on condition of anonymity , when a show breaks through to become a cash geyser in syndication . Then the show 's creator will make a respectable but not enormous amount of money  --  nothing , he said , like the fortunes of a $100 million or more that went to producers of shows like " The Cosby Show , " " Cheers " and " Family Ties " in the 1980 's or " Seinfeld " and " Frasier " more recently . <p> In all those cases , the network was not able to dictate terms in the initial deals with show creators . In an era of studio-owned networks , that kind of windfall is increasingly less likely to go to show creators and stars . <p> The networks and studios say they are being compelled to take larger portions of syndication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all spent in recent years on renewals of hit shows and big talent deals , few of which have panned out . <p> Mr. Hansen and Mr. Jacobson , who have negotiated several of these deals , said the networks and studios made the deals in response to a competitive frenzy largely of their own making . <p> " Everybody 's looking for the formula to a hit show , " Mr. Hansen said . " They all say , ' Let 's get the guys who have proven themselves by creating a hit show already . ' But most of these deals crapped out , either because these guys wear themselves out doing 200 episodes of a hit show , or else because they only have one hit show in them . " <p> In many of these deals , studios have signed comedy writers , expecting them to create new shows . The studio then tries to exact a commitment from a network to put the show on the air because the studio has secured so well-known a writer . <p> Recently , several network executives have begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shows based on strong original ideas . But , Mr. Jacobson said : " Has the emphasis on deals changed ? Not yet . A couple of the big studio players , like Fox , have spent their entire budget on deals . That does n't mean the deal fever has changed . It just means it might come from some other players . " <p> He added : " The history of this business is that somebody is always ready to make a deal . I do n't have a sense that the deal trend has changed because people are saying big deals are stupid . Some people are just saying , ' We do n't have any more money . If we did we 'd go out and spend it on more big deals . ' "
