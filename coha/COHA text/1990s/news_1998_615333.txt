<p> Six months later , many Gwinnett County residents still are coping with the effects of the tornado that struck early on the morning of April 9 . The storm uprooted homes , propelled trees through bedroom windows , cracked foundations and showered neighborhoods with debris . Many families still have n't finished the rebuilding process . <p> But for several tornado victims that the Journal-Constitution profiled in May and revisited last week , the outlook has changed for the better . <p> One couple was able to get a custom-designed house after their insurance company approved demolishing the old one . <p> A woman who was an art major in college viewed the damage to her family 's house as an opportunity , a chance to add flashes of color . A single man who had lived on his own for years moved back in with his parents in Virginia  --  and found he cherished his time with them . And still another family , who live in the hardest-hit subdivision in Gwinnett County , found a support group among their neighbors . <p> Here are their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Patricia Peguero may emerge from the disaster in better shape than before the storm . <p> The tornado wrecked their Peachtree Corners house thoroughly enough to justify razing it and building a new one . This home , they 've had custom-designed . <p> " Sometimes I would think if I had to build this house over , I 'd do it differently , " said Fernando Peguero , 58 . " Now we know what we want . We 're going to have a big open area in the kitchen . We 're adding more windows , two offices , a porch , and we 're making it blend with the environment more . " <p> The twister jarred the building off its foundation , and large cracks split the walls , separated the stairs from an adjoining wall , and did other damage . A half-dozen 70-foot trees fell through the roof . <p> The Pegueros were concerned that State Farm insurance company would try to fix it , and then it would never be the same , like a car that 's been in a collision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Patricia Peguero , 57 . " We knew it was n't salvageable . " <p> The insurance company agreed to pay $ 230,000 toward a new house , including $ 9,600 for landscaping . <p> After learning they would get a new structure , the Pegueros hired an architect in Alpharetta for $ 3,200 and an independent inspector to watch over construction . <p> Last week the contractor , recommended by their former Realtor , began demolition , a task that could be finished in the next few weeks . <p> The family may be in their three-bedroom apartment for another six months awaiting completion of their new house . The furniture from the old home crowds the apartment they live in now . <p> Fernando Peguero said he and his wife have tried to keep a positive outlook throughout the ordeal by taking stock of what they have : their health and their lives . Their business computer and records survived intact , as did their furniture , and they had good insurance coverage . <p> " If we did n't have insurance , we 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an inconvenience , but it 's just something you have to take in stride . " More colorful surroundings It took six months , but the tornado that dropped a tree through Doreen Williams ' master bedroom has finally brought some color into her family 's lives . <p> Her living room walls , cream when the 100-year-old pine smashed into the house April 9 , are now painted alternating shades of crayon-bright blue and green . <p> In the dining room , another drab , neutral shade has been replaced by sponge-painted layers over a base coat of carrot orange . <p> And the molding around the windows , once painted over , is now its original soft wood . <p> " I guess it 's just the art major in me , " said Williams , who casts bronze sculptures in her spare time . " You would n't want this to happen , but it can be an opportunity . " <p> The Williamses  --  Doreen , 40 ; husband Andy , 36 ; and children Alexander , 4 , and Sean-Kelly , 2  --  have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not without some cost and hassles . The tree 's impact on the roof above the bedroom buckled beams and cracked the drywall throughout the house on Dillards Mill Way in Duluth , leaving the family with a massive repair job . <p> At the end of April , after spending a month sleeping together in the living room , the family moved to a rented apartment in Alpharetta for six weeks , then left on a three-week vacation to visit family and friends . When they returned in midsummer , most of the major work was done . <p> Builders had replaced most of the roof , including the supports , and the walls , floors and carpets . Painters were still working when their furniture was delivered , so it was piled up in the middle of the room until everything was finished . <p> Now , just a few more jobs remain : fixing the cement driveway , which crackled under the weight of the heavy trucks , and cleaning out a cluttered back bedroom that has become a sort of repository for every unfinished task . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williamses are still out some money . Their coverage paid only $ 500 for tree removal , which did n't approach the full bill . And the family paid to replace items like light sockets and heating grates that were n't broken in the storm . " But it does n't make sense not to replace them , " Doreen Williams said . " Why put a rusty old vent on new paint ? " <p> There have been a few minor problems , too . A door was painted the wrong shade , and movers damaged a piece of furniture . A contractor that was supposed to deliver mulch to the Williamses and their neighbors never did , so they had to borrow a work truck and haul in 21 loads of the stuff , she said . <p> It 's strange , Williams said , how once everything is done , there will be little trace of the tornado . Except for the missing trees in the yard and the new paint on the walls , their lives will be just as they would have been if the storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like nothing happened , " she said . Starting afresh Dave Wingate was ready for a change . And though there are better ways to start on a new path than having a tornado destroy virtually everything you own , sometimes it takes something dramatic to rouse a person from a dead-end routine . <p> In June , two months after pine trees crashed through the roof of his two-story apartment on Baker Court near Holcomb Bridge Road in Norcross , Wingate moved into his parents ' house in his hometown of Bristol , Va . <p> At age 34 , Wingate , who is single , had lived in Gwinnett County almost 12 years . He left Georgia with nothing more than what he had arrived with . He missed his family , and he missed going for Sunday drives in the foothills of Virginia to see the autumn leaves changing color . <p> " I get to spend a little bit of quality time with my parents that you do n't get when you 're living somewhere else , " said Wingate . " I get to watch my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the experience of living through a tornado made him rethink his life and his priorities . He learned who his real friends were , such as Dennis and Stephanie Woods , the Lawrenceville couple who let him stay in their home for more than a month until he got back on his feet . <p> He also learned about his job as an assistant produce manager at Publix . The week after the storm hit , Wingate got no time off from work and had to take a vacation to clean out his wrecked apartment and move into an extended-stay hotel . A few weeks later he and his girlfriend broke up , but Wingate said the timing was a coincidence . <p> " I think I 've got a little more perspective on things , " he said . <p> The few things of value that he owned  --  a water bed , a chest of drawers , a television , two VCRs and a couch  --  all were destroyed in the storm . His collection of vintage sports magazines , including a 1956 edition of Sporting News with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cover , was irreplaceable . <p> Wingate had no renter 's insurance , but managed to obtain a $ 6,500 loan from the federal Small Business Administration to help him buy back some of the things he lost . The agency has given him 12 years to repay the loan at an interest rate of 3 1/2 percent , but Wingate said he plans to double up on the payments and do it in six . <p> After moving back to Bristol , Wingate got a job unloading trucks and filling orders at a Lowe 's home improvement store . He took a pay cut , but he has been able to save money living with his parents . He 's in no hurry to move , but when he does , he said , he will not go far . <p> " After I get straightened out , I want to save a little bit of money and buy a house here , or maybe in North Carolina , " he said . " I like the mountains , and I would n't mind seeing a little snow every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pfeiffer family lost a lot in the storm , but not their sense of humor . <p> " We 're the ones with no yard , " Skeeter Pfeiffer tells people who ask for directions , not a trace of self-pity in her voice . <p> A contractor told them repairs would take 30 days , but they wo n't be finished any time soon . The family has taken out a $ 25,000 loan to cover storm costs . For financial reasons , daughter Amy shelved her plan to study at Appalachian State University and attends Georgia Perimeter College in DeKalb County instead . <p> But they 've stayed upbeat , thanks to the tight-knit Locke Ridge Forest subdivision that Skeeter Pfeiffer describes as a support group . " It 's been like one big family helping each other , " she said . <p> The Pfeiffers  --  Dick , 60 , an architect ; Skeeter , 54 , an insurance coordinator ; and Amy , 23  --  have one of the largest lots , so they allowed construction vehicles to pass through their yard on their way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors on both sides agreed to pay to reconstruct portions of the Pfeiffers ' lawn . <p> " We have close to an acre , so it 's easier for the workers to come through our yard , " Skeeter Pfeiffer said . " Both neighbors said they would make sure when it was time for reseeding and grading they would help with the destruction of our yard . The working together as a team has made it all possible . " <p> Still , much work remains undone . Aside from the yard , the house needs painting and the deck needs rebuilding . The family lived in a motel for two months while structural damage was repaired . <p> " We were told initially everything would be in and out in 30 days , " Skeeter Pfeiffer said . " We 're now looking at six months , and we 've got a ways to go . That 's the thing that has surprised everyone . It 's been wearing . You wish it would be back to the way it was . " <p> Their subdivision near Norcross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to get used to looking at the neighborhood , " said Amy Pfeiffer . " I 'm not getting sick looking at it anymore . It just made me a little nauseous to see it like it was . " <p> A tree replanting program initiated by Northside Hospital is scheduled to begin next month and should accelerate the recovery . Each member of the homeowners ' association will receive 10 to 20 seedlings . <p> Although the storm 's financial and physical effects will be felt for a long time , Amy Pfeiffer said the subdivision has changed in a more profound way . <p> " It 's made all the neighbors aware of each other , " she said . " There 's a genuine concern because everyone has something in common now . I know after the storm I found myself walking up and down the street to see how other neighbors were doing . I was walking , as a complete stranger , seeing if they were all right .
