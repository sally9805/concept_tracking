" KATHERINE NEWMAN Cedarburg , Wis . <P> Your report on corporate welfare , the tax breaks and subsidies that companies get SPECIAL REPORT , Nov. 9 , represents the best kind of journalism . Unfortunately , government giveaways to corporations have a long , rich history in the U.S. Mining companies can still take advantage of laws enacted in the 1800s that allow special privileges . The only difference between this and the corporate welfare you reported on is that today the federal and local governments are selling off our future at bargain rates . DAVID BROOKS Fox River Grove , Ill . <P> You said that while corporate welfare is a financial boon to some companies , it is unfair to companies that do not receive equal public tax dollars .

That 's $4 million more in collected taxes than there would have been if we had left the area . In fact , it 's some $800,000 more than we would have paid at our old location . And 400 local jobs have been preserved . HADJ AMARI , PRESIDENT ABB Instrumentation Inc . Rochester , N.Y . <P> Our schools are falling apart , urban centers are deteriorating , and children go hungry while the government haphazardly showers money and tax breaks on incredibly wealthy corporations . I am outraged that I have to mortgage my firstborn to get a loan or credit , buy a home or a car or fund an education for my children , while all corporations have to do is just start a rumor that they want to " relocate " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HUBLER Bear , Del.
