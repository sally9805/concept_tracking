Sikeston " Riding on a Simile " // They were local boys from the Missouri boot heel . John Lett and Chester Oldham were driving south toward Sikeston on a warm Saturday night when they heard the back tire blow an the big maroon sedan ahead of them on the curve . They-watched wide-eyed as the Buick swerved wildly off the narrow pavement of old Highway 60 , skidded on the soft shoulder , vaulted across the drainage ditch , then turned over twice with the muffled crunch of mud and steel . In moments it was over . The car came to rest upside down on the edge of an alfalfa field , its radio still offering country music in the sudden silence , its headlights still reaching out through the darkness . // Lett and Oldham pulled over and made their way toward the wreck , " seared to death " of what they 'd find , Lett told his wife later . The doors were closed , the driver 's window down , but the car was strangely empty . In the hack seat was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nervously they began searching the dark field and the hank of the ditch . Others were stopping now , drawn by the accident , their flashlights darting in the country blackness . Somebody went for the state trooper in Sikeston. // " Finally we had to go into the ditch , " Lett remembered . They waded and poked in the three feet of brackish water . At first one man thought he heard something up the road , " kind of a gurgle and a splash , " he said later . But the sound seemed too far away . They continued looking near the overturned car with its ghostly lights and tinny music . // It was near midnight , May 17 , 1946 , and America was changing . Three months before , US diplomat George Kennan had sent his fateful " long telegram " from Moscow about generic Russian treachery , impressing on receptive officials in Washington the sinister threat of the Soviet Union . In March , not far up the read from Sikeston , in Fulton , Missouri , Winston Churchill had spoken much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " speech . Across the country , powerful interests were financing the great red-baiting campaigns that would bring to power the Congress that launched Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon , the Congress of Taft-Hartley , the Hollywood Ten , and the Hiss case . This same weekend in May the deadline was to expire on a nationwide railway walkout . Part of a vast wave of labor grievances that had built up during the war years , it was an opening struggle for economic democracy in the coming boom . In a few days , however , a defiant President Harry Truman would seize the railroads and break the strike , a historic act of his own instinctive aversion to deeper reform , his own accommodation to whet he and other Democrats saw as the forces of the moment . It was the beginning of the postwar era in the United States . // In the darkness along Highway 60 in southeastern Missouri near the Arkansas line , they were searching for a man none of them knew . Some had glimpsed him as he passed their cars on the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1942 Buick , " a nice-looking young fellow , " one said later , " somebody in a hurry . . . a stranger who did n't know the road . " // His name was William Jefferson Blythe II , and in a sense his car came hurtling that night out of a different America , a country before the cold war and its anxious politics of Sear and reaction . // The family called him W.J. to set him apart from his father and namesake , Willie , a lean , hawklike man who had married a thirteen-year-old girl named Lou in Tippah County , Mississippi , near the Tennessee border , and then had moved west across Arkansas in a covered wagon to settle on the hot , windy plain of north Texas . W.J. had been born there in 1918 , the fourth of nine children . He grew up in a cramped four-room farmhouse of canvas and paper walls , without plumbing or electricity , pitched on forty acres of hard-scrabble cotton and scanty pasture near the Red River , halfway between Sherman and Denison. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression they be came one more story of the torment in rural America . By the early 1930s , the scorched farms of north Texas were dying , and Willie Blythe along with them , a slow , agonizing death from colon cancer . The oldest son still at home , W.J. rose at three in he morning to keep the farm going and worked eight hours every day after school at nearby Ashburn Dairy , bringing home a little extra milk or butter with his few dollars in pay . His sisters remembered that his bed was set in the front room of the farmhouse , near the door for his comings and goings , and that he scarcely slept in it . They could never afford a hospital or regular medical care for Willie . Toward the end , their father lay in the back of the little farmhouse , shaking and screaming with convulsions . W.J. would calmly take a crippled sister and others out of the house , then go back in to give the writhing man some morphine , and emerge a few minutes later to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always smiling , " one of them remembered , " always so easygoing no matter what was happening or what he felt inside . " // For two years , as Willie suffered and died , they had held on to the homestead with an emergency loan through a New Deal farm program . But in the summer of 1936 , two payments behind and which less than a hundred dollars due on the note , they lost it to the bank . W.J. watched as his mother became a hotel maid in Sherman , a destitute widow in her midforties  --  almost the same age at which her grandson would become president of the United States fifty-seven years later . " There was n't nothin ' wrong with the Blythes ' cept they was poor , " a relative who lived with them said afterward . " Rag poor , " another added . // But there was to be something more about W.J. than poverty and pain , more than the loyalty and sacrifice of a young man trying to save the farm and care for a broken family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more self-seeking purpose and ambition . Out of the boy who gave with such innocent ease there came a man who used others easily and took advantage of their own innocence . " He was n't ever going to be a farmer or least of all be poor ar unimportant , " said a sister . When they lost the farm , the family moved to a shabby apartment in Sherman . From there eighteen-year-old W.J. was soon gone , on the road selling auto parts in Oklahoma and beyond . // He had quit the old White Rock School after only the eighth grade , but he would seem more educated than he was . He now called himself Bill Blythe , relying on a quick , naturally glib intelligence and on the methodical sunniness that became with strangers a winning , lasting charm , and he found his calling as that legendary American figure of two centuries , the traveling man , the itinerant salesman  --  " the fellow that chats pleasantly while he 's overcharging you , " as one country humorist put it . // Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth without ever seeming smooth that even the sale  --  or its wounds afterward  --  could seem unimportant People remembered how he was always touching , patting friends and customers on the back , often holding both their shoulders as he spoke or , more important , listening intently . " He made you feel like you were the only one in the world , " said a close friend and customer . " A gentle , conscientious , beautiful person , " another called him . " He was a wonderful salesman , a perfect salesman , " said a member of his family . " He was always eager to please . And he sold himself . " // It began , and ended , with the territory . The traveling man took it as he found it , the easy sells and the hard , the spenders and the cheap , the competitors honest and corrupt . There was the business as the public saw or imagined it  --  and then there was the inside reality of the favored , the exclusive , the rigged . The traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dike his fellow salesmen , kept them as a kind of private possession , not for the ordinary world to know or use . The salesman 's route was the end of a relentless food chain on the raw outskirts of American capitalism , at once free and easy and unforgiving . " When they start not smiling back , that 's an earthquake , " said a famous figure in the trade . " And then you get yourself a couple of spots on your hat and you 're finished . " // The good salesman never changed ar openly challenged his brittle , perishable world ; he talked and smiled his way through and around it . There was no hard or soft sell , only the smart or the stupid . Technique took over , became substance . He drawled with the good ole boys , spoke fluently with the city people , learned just enough about every product , every customer to talk with seeming authority , without threatening or losing them . // In the late 1930s and on into the early 1940s , Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the J. H. Pereue Equipment Company of Memphis , driving from dealer to dealer , big town to small , hotel to tourist court , often towing a tool of the trade , what one account called " a-bulky **29;315;TOOLONG contraption . " It was a white-collar life of company cars and ample pay , of " relentless good cheer , " as another account described it , and of many people well-met , some of them becoming friends , though none too close or for too long . In the end , if he al lowed himself to think about it , the traveling man was mostly alone , with the next sale , with the run . " There is no rock bottom to the life , " Arthur Miller wrote about a kindred Willy Loman . " He do n't put a bolt to a nut , he do n't tell you the law or give you medicine . He 's a man out there in the blue , riding on a smile and a shoeshine . . . . It comes with the territory . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in all the bawdy old jokes about traveling salesmen , there were women-especially for Bill Blythe . // Less than a year after his father died , W.J. drove across the state line into Oklahoma to marry , somewhat furtively , a girl he had known in Sherman , eighteen-year-old Adele Gash . For a while they were crowded together with another Blythe son and his-wife in one of the tiny rooms of the old farmhouse . " I never lived-with so little , " she would say later . But when Adele went to visit an aunt in Dallas , W.J. did n't come for her as he had promised . " I knew it was over , " she would say , " when I got this package from him with all my clothes . " They were divorced at the end of 1936 , and by then the new Bill Blythe was on the road . Still , he went back to Adele often after the divorce and , the following spring , fathered a baby boy by her , Henry Leon , born in January 1938 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to northern California and for a time lost touch with Bill completely . " He was a wonderful , good-looking ladies , man , " Adele would tell her family . " He wanted so much to be liked . Everyone liked him . " // At a Nevada , Missouri , roadhouse early in 1940 , he met a pretty dark-haired seventeen-year-old named Wanetta Alexander . She was skipping choir practice on a lark from a nearby town across the line in dry Kansas . " I was just standing there by the jukebox when a handsome young man walked over and asked me to dance , " she would say . " I said no , but then " Alexander 's Ragtime Band " came on . He insisted , You are going to dance with me . ' And I did . " He was stocky then , just under five feet ten inches tall , weighing about 180 pounds , with blue eyes and dark brown hair combed straight back . Wanetta thought him " a living doll . . . good-looking , good clothes , smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Netherlands Hotel in Kansas City , where Bill sometimes stayed for weeks while making his rounds in western Missouri and Kansas . " We 'd . . . hit all the hotels , restaurants , and dance halls , " she recalled . " He was wonderful , gorgeous , fun , and happy-go-lucky. " // By the end of 1940 Wanetta was pregnant , end Bill Blythe had gone to northern California , supposedly to see Adele and his first child . " He played with the baby like he loved it , and he was just his old self , " said a friend . But after a few days Bill had suddenly run off with Adele 's pretty younger sister , Minnie Faye . " W.J. wanted to marry Faye because he got another girl pregnant and wanted to get out of it , " one relative explained . " He was a traveling salesman , I 'll tell you , " said another witness . " He sold himself to the ladies . " // Bill and Minnie Faye Gash were married on December 29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , was soon over . " Faye was railing Adele back in California and saying she had to come home , " a member of her family recounted , adding the familiar refrain about Bill Blythe the charmer , the irrepressible seducer . " But she almost always spoke highly of W.J. , just like everybody else . " // Under pressure from the Alexander family , his hasty marriage to Minnie Faye was annulled in Little Rock in April 1941 , and in less than a week he was in a judge 's chambers in the Jackson County courthouse in Kansas City , marrying Wanetta . He had hurried through the rain to be there , and arrived just minutes before the ceremony . Eight days later , he was on the road again while his new wife gave birth to a baby girl . They named her Sharron . " Sure am glad that you are all right , " he said in a telegram to the hospital . " How is the baby ? . . . I love you always . Love , W.J. Blythe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months that summer and fall , driving through southern Missouri and Oklahoma in his trademark robin's-egg-blue Buick , feeding and diapering the infant in the back seat of the car . They settled for a time in Monroe , Louisiana , in an apartment she remembered as " a dump . " But within six months Wanetta was gone , too , taking their baby beck to Kansas City . " Bill was cheating on me , " she said later . " I know there was a lady at one of the nightclubs . " // Over the next year and a half following Pearl Harbor , Bill Blythe stayed on the road , a man in his midtwenties facing the expanding wartime draft even with a wife and child . " The war has about drove me crazy , " he wrote Wanetta in the spring of 1942 . " Tell everyone hello and kiss the baby for me .

" I am going to Calif . Maybe then if you still want to we can start all over again . Love , Bill . " // Six months later , on a trot duly night , he was out with a woman in Shreveport , Louisiana , when she suddenly fell ill . He took her to Tri-State Hospital , and while she was being treated he noticed the pretty personable student nurse on the evening shift . She was Virginia Dell Cassidy , from a small town in southwestern Arkansas . Then barely twenty , with large eyes , full red lips , and long raven hair , she had an easy laugh and an air of worldly exuberance that belied her age or origins . She was engaged at the time to a high school sweetheart but was immediately taken with Bill Blythe and his striking good looks . The salesman had started to leave the hospital but then hesitated , turned back , and walked up to the young nurse to ask about the ring she we ; wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing . surprised at her own response . They went out for a soda that evening and kissed good night . He rented an apartment in Shreveport and took a job selling cars . " Yes , she 's lying right here beside me , " he once said with disarming candor when her roommate called looking for her Swept away , Virginia would later describe the courtship in words the , took on the flavor of a country western ballad . She soon pressed him to marry . He had not told her  --  and never would tell her  --  about his current wife or his children or any of the others . // Though Blythe did his best to resist marriage , Virginia was not to be denied . It was n't long before he hurriedly wrote to Wanetta , saying he had " met a nurse down in Louisiana , " and wanted out of their marriage . The young mother in Kansas City agreed and filed papers immediately that summer . " He was my first and only love , " Wanetta would say afterward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the divorce , ordering the absent William J. Blythe to pay forty-two dollars a month in child support . But even then it was too late . On September 3 , 1943 , after their swift late-summer romance , Bill Blythe had committed bigamy by marrying Virginia Cassidy before a justice of the peace in Texarkana. // He joined the army and was sent abroad only five weeks after his marriage to Virginia . A mechanic in an auto-maintenance battalion , he served first in North Africa , then in the liberation of Rome and the bloody Italian campaign north to the Arno River . A niece in the Blythe family remembered writing him once during the war , asking for a leaf from Europe for a school project . " Sorry , there are no leaves on the trees . They 're all shot off , " he wrote her back . Faithfully , Blythe sold his GI-issue cigarettes at a profit and sent the proceeds back to Virginia , who had finished training and returned to live with her parents in Hope , Arkansas . She wrote him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was discharged as a technician , third grade , in December 1945 with a commendation for his service . He went back once after the war to see Wanetta and their daughter , and she remembered him walking with a limp , even using a cane , though there would be no military records of his having been wounded . " The boy had been through hell , " an employer would say later . // For reasons of sentiment and privacy , she remembered , Bill had his reunion with Virginia in Shreveport , and after a brief stay in Hope they soon moved to Chicago , where he had a job selling on the road for an Illinois equipment company . He planned to settle down there eventually and open his own business . Virginia became pregnant almost immediately . Her conception came at the beginning of the great postwar baby boom . // That winter he was still driving two hundred miles a day , coming back at night to their apartment near the Loop ; his rural Arkansas wife walked about the great lakeshore city somewhat wide-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia flew back to Texas in February to nurse his dying mother , but Lou Blythe was gone before Bill could get there himself . // They had bought a small bungalow in Forest Park , just west of downtown Chicago . The transaction was taking longer than expected . Her baby due in August , still suffering acute morning sickness , Virginia planned to go home to Hope to give them both a respite while their suburban house was vacated and cleaned . // On a last evening out together with friends at the Palmer House , they posed for a nightclub photographer . Later they sent relatives the portrait , inscribed , " All our love , Bill and Virginia . " She is in dark lipstick and long false eyelashes , with bright nail polish , a corsage , and a cigarette , he in a natty tweed sport coat showing the white points of his pocket handkerchief , a full-faced young salesman of twenty-eight , giving that reassuring smile . // In mid-May the Forest Park home was ready , their furniture moved in . Bill was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carrying a case of bourbon for his father-in-law , down country roads he had traveled so much in another time . // It was nearly two hours after the accident that they finally discovered the body lying face down in the shallow water several yards away from the wreck , out in the unsearched darkness near where one of them had first heard the faint sounds . He had been thrown clear or perhaps had crawled from the car . When they found him , handsome Bill Blythe 's hands were still clutching the ditch grass , trying to pull him self up and out . Though barely injured , only a small blue bruise visible on his head , he had been stunned enough to drown in the ditch where he fell , a simple narrow drainage channel dug by the New Deal to reclaim swampland and rescue poor farmers much like his own family in Texas . He was still forty miles from the Arkansas line , more than three hundred miles from Hope . // Virginia mourned big Bill Blythe as the great love of her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the martyred young salesman the benefit of their fonder memories , discreetly burying the rest . // The good-natured baby born three months later bearing Bill Blythe 's name would become president of the United States . Much of the father is evident in the son he never knew . Equally important , the salesman 's death meant that his talented little boy would grow up not in Chicago but in Arkansas , with quite another father , another heritage  --  and that , too , would shape a presidency . // In 1993 his own side of the family often wondered what the charming , stoic traveling man might have thought of it all . There were differing memories about Bill Blythe 's political views . Some thought him a Roosevelt Democrat , others a business Republican . But then a good salesman 's convictions had to fit the moment  --  or else were put aside . His real politics , after all , were the sale . // A relative visited Bill Blythe 's grave the week his son was inaugurated in Washington . " It made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , you could just never tell about W.J. Not really . "
