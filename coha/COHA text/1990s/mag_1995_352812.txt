The Pentagon once said it needed only 20 B-2s . With 20 , I can sustain bomber operations over an extended period of time , ' ' General John Loh , head of the Air Combat Command , told Congress three years ago . Legislators were skeptical , threatening to pay for only 15 , but they were eventually convinced . Today , however , B-2 advocates in the defense industry , on Capitol Hill and at the Pentagon are lobbying for 20 more of the Stealth bombers . Seven former Defense Secretaries have urged President Clinton to buy more B- 2s because , they wrote in a Jan. 4 letter , the end of the cold war was neither the end of history nor the end of danger . ' ' Furthermore , B-2 builder Northrop Grumman has quite a deal for the Pentagon : the new batch of radar- eluding , batwinged planes will cost just a fraction of what the first 20 did . <P> Northrop claims that it can build the next 20 planes for $11.4 billion , or $570 million each . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first 20 B-2s cost . Even minus their hefty development cost , the first batch cost more than $1 billion a plane . But Northrop 's new price tag is dubious , and the bargain questionable . Defense experts expect the final price to balloon . More important , U.S. taxpayers could be buying a flying white elephant with scant strategic value because the key weapons it requires to justify the investment do n't exist . <P> Wary U.S. taxpayers need to know that the $570 million buys only a stripped-down version of the plane . Spare parts and additional engineering would tack on about $2 billion to the total bill . And some government bean counters regard even that proposed $13.5 billion price tag as too low an estimate . The Pentagon believes the final price for another 20 planes would approach $20 billion . The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office concludes that each new B-2 could cost $1.3 billion , for a total of $26 billion . I do n't know where Northrop is coming up with their numbers , ' ' says William Myers , who spent 20 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the same at CBO for 13 years . <P> During his cost review of the still largely classified B-2 , Myers found something else mystifying : the first planes off Northrop 's assembly line were the cheapest , and the price per plane grew over the life of the program . The more you buy , ' ' he says , the more expensive each plane gets . ' ' It 's the reverse of the learning curve , ' ' which anticipates lower costs as production skills are honed . <P> Ralph Crosby , Northrop vice president for the B-2 , says CBO 's historical analysis ca n't predict the cost of the next planes because we now have a firm , fixed-price offer ' ' pending at the Pentagon . It 's based on lean production techniques , ' ' Crosby says . The 11,000 people working on the first B-2s , for example , would be trimmed to about 3,600 for the second 20.
