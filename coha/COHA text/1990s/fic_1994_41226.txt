WITH A ( let us call him A , since he insists ) in the rare and vulnerable position of being " done , " we have the unanticipated opportunity of simple speech . We can compare notes . Not in order to clear the air . No , the air is what we 'd like at last to be able to see , in order to know what it is we 've been breathing . <p> A 's secret is that he does n't exist . Could n't imaginably exist . He is some baggage , or a sort of bundling . A gathering of symptoms . In the evening when he sits and stares out the wintery window , his children playing at his feet , snow accumulating to depths of three or four inches around the tires of his sporty sedan , we fancy that he is deep in thought . For he is a novelist or a character in a novel . But a dry gathering or bundling of sticks is not capable of meditation ! <p> What , then , is A 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Believe me , his neighbors have n't a clue . The answer to this shockingly simple question  --  a question so basic that it could almost draw blood to the patchwork of A 's face  --  is held in the poses that A has struck for us . The figures he has cut . Why else the excessive length of him ? The mobile features ? For God 's sake , let us tell the truth for once ! It will help with the important healing . Just say it , " A is not a real person ! " <p> But he is perhaps a sign ; sometimes he even achieves the sublime heights of metaphor , present for those of us who cling to the idea that someone somewhere might be a real human being . The only disservice we do him is when we fail to take his figures seriously . He is speaking to us , in his awkward way . Let us at least listen . <p> Of course , there are the children , the ones playing about his feet . You will need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time to sleep . They 're your responsibility now . <p> And then there is B. B is a professor at a Midwestern university . He is writing about A 's work . B is not a threat to us because B does not exist either , could not imaginably exist . But B is not mere baggage . B is a sort of puppet . This makes very little difference to you , I suppose . <p> B read A 's work with a strange mixture of dread and expectation . B admired A 's obsession with peeling away the layers of the self , all of the excrescences of life , like cars , possessions , money , food , other people . All for the exquisite dramatic purpose of arriving at the zero degree of the self , the absolute floor of human being where something enormous whether good or bad might be expected . B observed with the critical acumen characteristic of puppets that A 's characters quit jobs , left lovers , abandoned security , threw away money with psychotic virtuosity . Because B himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by refusing ever to do anything that might be mistaken for a voluntary act , he felt certain that no one would ever really do any of the self-destructive things which A attributed to his heroes . And yet B felt that he had of course done them all many times . This explains B 's occasional bouts with dread . For example , even though money accumulated in his savings account , accreted cell by cell like some berserk tumor , he was frequently convinced that within the next year he would need to begin living over steam grates in our nation 's great capital . Or he imagined that he saw bodies , shapeless brown carcasses , at the side of the road when he drove down one of our otherwise flawless superhighways . Because he can feel a dread so absurd , we may love him without being in error . He too is a mythic hero of the morally abject . <p> Then , in the fall of 1990 , A came to stay with B for a week . The surreal arbitrariness of A 's visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the university or to speak with any of the Midwestern students , none of whom were as real as the colorful boxes of breakfast cereal which B kept in surprising quantities on his kitchen shelf . Not wishing to offend the celebrated fiction writer , B felt that surely the best thing to do was to provide without ostentation the ordinary courtesies . So , on the first morning of A 's stay , B made coffee . To that point , A had not said a word . A 's visit began to remind B of certain stories by Kafka . Then B noticed that A in fact looked like Kafka . To be sure , this was a Kafka who could have passed for a matinee idol or high-school quarterback . B was about to break the awkward silence by commenting on A 's resemblance to Kafka , when A muttered angrily that nothing was as irritating to him as being compared to Kafka . Perhaps , thought B , it really was a Dostoevski story he had been thinking of . Certainly ! The Double . For there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A=B . But , B worried , is there anything sinister in a person who knows my own thoughts ? Is there anything wrong with someone who knows my own story , and not only knows it but tells it long before I have even begun to piece together the parts of what was , after all , my own life ? Was this perhaps a form of evil ? B would have liked to ponder this matter , but , after all , he had a guest . <p> In the afternoon , B asked A about a scene in A 's most recent novel , The Music of Chance , that had perplexed him . In this scene , the protagonist has staked a young punk of a cardsharp poker player to a high-stake game of seven card stud at the home of two wealthy ( but notoriously amateur ) gamblers whose chief characteristic to that point had been losing lots of money . With the protagonist 's stake and the kid 's skill , they should have cleaned up . But as fate and the requirements of plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , they lost not only all of their money but the protagonist 's $5,000 car as well . In a last desperate move , the protagonist cuts cards with one of the hosts , double or nothing , trying to win back the car . They lose even that , a seven of hearts to a four of diamonds , placing them now an additional $5,000 in debt . But A 's characters  --  all of them , winners and losers alike  --  insist that the debt to be repaid is $10,000 . The wealthy couple now have in their possession the protagonist 's car , $5,000 from winning the double or nothing cut , and now an additional mysterious , perhaps mystic , $5,000 . Where had it come from ? Had A made a simple error in addition ? <p> B asked A about the scene . A was amused . B felt like an insect . He should n't have questioned this rare artist 's choice . A puffed on his notorious black cigarillo and gazed up into the purling smoke as if the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , " It 's interesting that you should ask about that scene . I wrote it in a country retreat . I was terrifically excited by it . When I emerged from the cabin in which I was working , in triumph , I looked across the yard and saw that my daughter was taking a shit on the ground . " He laughed . B was enthralled by that awe which often seizes puppets . Of course . Money , shit , flow , pure excess . This was a man who had sounded Marx 's critique of the " money form " to its abysmal fundament . B 's paltry accountant 's approach to the scene filled him with shame . <p> Later , as if to add an exclamation point to this conversation , A cleaned up at a poker party thrown in his honor . A summoned the poker chips , coins , and markers of B 's colleagues and even the department head of the middling Midwestern university with a sort of easy contempt . B 's department chair grinned in grim good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coins . <p> One afternoon B drove A out into the countryside and the two had breakfast at a little cafe in a town called Gibson City . They had eggs , hash browns , toast , and coffee . It cost them each $1.65 . A announced that he would do something " mythic " with the little meal in his next novel . The idea of mythic hash browns dazzled B. <p> And then one day , of course , A was gone . B 's house was again simple , palpable , merely itself . Faint essence of exotic tobaccos hovering near the ceiling . The only other trace of A was a copy of his book The Invention of Solitude which A had left behind for B. He placed it with compassion on the pillow of B 's neatly made bed , as if he were a maid leaving a chocolate . <p> The Invention of Solitude is , in part , A 's memoir of his relationship with his father . At the heart of this work is the stunning discovery that A 's grandmother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . The grandfather had deserted the family and was keeping " another woman . " Through a clever lawyer 's pleading for the distraught condition of the grandmother , she was found innocent . She moved off with her children and they lived their lives in an awful , a breathtaking isolation . The horrible trauma of the murder and trial , the permanent absence of the father , the perverse self-absorption of the family all played profoundly on the character of A 's father . A wrote , " Devoid of passion , either for a thing , a person , or an idea , incapable or unwilling to reveal himself under any circumstances , he A 's father had managed to keep himself at a distance from life , to avoid immersion in the quick of things . He ate , he went to work , he had friends , he played tennis , and yet for all that he was not there . In the deepest , most unalterable sense , he was an invisible man . " <p> All at once , as the last paragraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we understood that this story was not about A , nor even about the pathetic puppet B , it was about you , C ! Yes , you silent C , sly lecteur ! As if this essay were an installment of This Is Your Life , an installment filmed on location in that ring of hell reserved for those who imagine they do not share in the horrors of others , those most intense hypocrites , you are obliged now to admit , reader , that this is your fate , too . <p> Consider . Is n't it true that you never met your grandfather ? Is n't it true that , like A 's grandfather , yours faced business hardship by running off with " another woman " ? Your grandfather also disgraced himself by embezzling from his oil business and then blaming it on his son ( your uncle ) . For these sins he was perhaps not murdered , but he was surely " cut out " of the family , made to seem as if he had never been . C , your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , old enough to see but not to understand . <p> The horror of this story , this myth  --  it is larger than A , B , and C  --  the Curse of the Absent Father , is that by a kind of metonymic contamination the literal absence of grandfathers led to the bewitching , figurative absence of fathers . C 's father was " as if " dead . C spent his youth trying to prod him into response . He poked at him as a child pokes at something dead with a stick . But vodka and afternoons with Perry Mason kept them both alone . In two solitudes . The solitude of fathers rooted in memory . The solitude of children rooted in the moment 's immediate pain . <p> Of course , in The Invention of Solitude , A has the courage to wrap his arms about the corpse of the father and look right into his eyes to see the impossible spark which A himself still feels in spite of all the evidence . But you , C , what have you dared ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take C into their arms . " Oh mes semblables , brothers ! We do not exist , we could not imaginably exist . We are baggage , bundles of twigs , or puppets . " But , do not be mistaken , this recognition is more than an acknowledgment of failure , more than that nothing . After all , A , B , and C are touching at last . It is truly a very profound touching that they execute in this hugging . This touching is the middle path of which Buddhists speak : salvation through the annihilation of sorrow . This touching is the knowing kiss of lips . It holds the possibility that even if we have been abandoned by our fathers , we do not have to die alone . <p>
