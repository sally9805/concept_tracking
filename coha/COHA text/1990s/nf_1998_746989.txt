Computer-aided engineering , combined with expert interpretation , can help manufacturers quickly satisfy demand for increasingly small yet reliable products . <p> Part one of a two-part series that examines the growing usefulness of computer-aided engineering programs for the design of electronics packaging . <p> CONSUMERS WOULD NO doubt relish wafer-thin wireless telephones , or computers with the dimensions of a business card  --  convenient products that can tucked away until needed . Of course , products with mull dimensions must still satisfy basic ergonomic requirements , such as dialing a number , entering data , or producing high-quality sound or visual output . Current market trends suggest that the ideal consumer product would serve its function , yet not exist . <p> This appetite for increasingly small yet reliable products creates challenging functional electronics design requirements . The simultaneous need to be first to market fosters severe product development pressures , especially given the already accelerated pace of technology innovation in the electronics industry . Manufacturers struggle to design reliable electronics products in a limited time . A judicious application of computer-aided engineering ( CAE ) capabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this formidable marketplace . <p> To grasp the importance of CAE for electronics packaging , consider the current position of the electronics industry . Growing at more than 30 percent annually , the semiconductor marketplace promises to reach $335 billion by the year 2000 , dominated by personal computing , wireless communications , automotive electronics , smartcards , and energy/environmental applications . This rapidly expanding market holds the promise of potentially huge financial rewards for companies that are able to satisfy consumer demands . <p> Currently , success in the electronics industry depends on reaching the market first with innovative new products that are smaller , cheaper , and more ergonomic , yet more reliable . These modern manufacturing parameters in turn lead to the creation of an increasingly complex , multidisciplinary design environment . To master the stringent requirements of smaller product design , manufacturers must break down the traditional divide between electronics design and mechanical design . And , as the price of consumer electronics continues to plummet , companies face severe pressure to minimize costs while maintaining margins . <p> Product design now determines 75 percent of manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made early in the design process . Additionally , companies pay dearly for product and preproduction prototype failures . According to data collected from a broad range of manufacturers over the past 15 years , design errors trapped early in product development clearly cost less and take less time to fix . The pie chart on page 66 shows the relative cost of fixing failures during the various phases of the product life cycle . <p> The cost of product fixes increases more than threefold during the preproduction stage ( after the first prototype ) , compared with fixes before the first prototype . This ratio increases to more than 7:1 for errors that are detected during production . The relative cost of fixing a product released to the field can be catastrophic  --  more than 20:1 when compared with preprototype fixes . Such product recalls or replacements can also exact a heavy price in customer loyalty . In addition , consider the negative impact of time lost making fixes  --  notably , the adverse effect on potential sales . <p> Companies , therefore , benefit tremendously from errors caught at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster resolution at a lower cost and a greater chance of product success . Therefore , increasing numbers of manufacturers now turn to solids-based computer-aided design ( CAD ) and CAE to address escalating electronic packaging challenges . THE ROLE OF CAE <p> Although CAE alone delivers lower-fidelity results than prototyping , when used by experts it enables the most cost-effective assessment of many design alternatives . CAE provides enough fidelity to understand the impact of design choices , and so contributes to the deeper understanding of product behavior and problem detection before the commitment of production resources . Expertise retains a significant role in CAE modeling , because ability and experience are required to capture the functional behavior of components with abstract models . Engineers must then interpret results based upon the assumptions of the models . <p> Currently , three classes of software specifically support electronics packaging design : integrated computer-aided design ( C . AD ) CAE software , general-purpose CAE software , and specialty CAE software solutions . Corporations across all industries have adopted integrated CAD-CAE software as the linchpin of their strategies to use solids-based technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most general assessment of a product 's engineering behavior and properties , detecting the most fundamental problems . <p> This class of software excels in its ability to quickly calculate the physical properties of components , assemblies , and products , such as weight , moment of inertia , and center of gravity . These measurements can be critical to the understanding of both ergonomics and performance . For example , the weight and center of gravity can partially reflect the ergonomics and utility of wireless telecommunications equipment , while the knowledge of inertial properties may be important for quick predictions on the performance of military electronics in the field . In addition , CAD software enables the detection of gross component interference problems that prohibit proper component assembly . <p> The integrated CAE software emphasizes automatic creation and updating of finite-element-analysis ( FEA ) models based on CAD geometry . The effectiveness of this associativity between CAD and FEA depends on the product behavior to be evaluated and the quality of implementation . Leading suppliers include Dassault Systemes ( sold by IBM ) , Parametric Technology Corp. , Unigraphics Solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on using the breadth , depth , and reliability of their finite-element simulation capabilities to address a broad range of engineering problems , with options for automating and customizing the user environment . Supporting analysis capabilities include structural static with geometric nonlinearities , plasticity , creep , fracture , and fatigue ; vibration analysis ; linear and nonlinear transient dynamic analysis ; heat transfer analysis with conduction , convection , and radiation for steady state and transient conditions ; computational fluid dynamics ; and electromagnetic analysis . The MacNeal-Schwendler Corp . of Los Angeles is the largest and best-known general-purpose CAE provider . Other leading vendors include Ansys Inc. , Fluent Inc. , Hibbit-Karlsson , Sorensen , and MARC Analysis Research Corp . <p> Mechanical engineers working in the electronics industries report that once they have mastered a given general-purpose CAE program , it becomes very difficult to change products . The competitive pressures on the product development front simply do not accommodate the typical learning curve for this genre of software . Adopters should , therefore , carefully consider their selection of a general-purpose CAE supplier . Potential buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of finite-element-analysis capabilities , and quality of support . <p> Specialty CAE solutions offer specific expertise to address a limited set of highly focused , key problems with the highest reliability available today . Electronic Design Validation System ( EDVS ) from Pacific Numerix is the most notable example of specialty CAE electronics packaging software . This software offers the most fluid environment for building and evaluating electronics-specific simulation models . Arguably , general-purpose software can address some of the problems that EDVS targets . However , EDVS automates much of the work that must be performed manually or programmed with general-purpose CAE software . No other software matches EDVS for other types of simulation , such as Printed Circuit Board ( PCB ) manufacturing , including the solder reflow process and the optimization of component placement , considering thermal and vibration requirements . <p> Other small specialty suppliers , not focused on electronics-based applications , offer specific capabilities unmatched by general-purpose suppliers . For example , Centric Engineering offers superior expertise for coupled fluid-thermal analysis ; this is useful for component cooling studies . Engineering Software Research and Development ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important for evaluating connectors and mechanical failure at multimaterial interfaces such as those encountered in multichip modules . MECHANICAL DESIGN CHALLENGES <p> Shrinking functional and spatial requirements often force designers to introduce ever-larger numbers of components into increasingly small spaces . The positioning and grouping of components must still satisfy operational needs , that is , functional dependencies of neighboring components and effective heat removal , while minimizing wasted space . Here , designers and engineers have adopted solids-based integrated CAD-CAE software to evaluate spatial considerations , weight , and other engineering properties . They apply electrical and mechanical CAE simulation software to predict functional performance of the overall system . Specialty software can optimize component placement . <p> Consumer and military electronics can encounter a variety of harsh environmental conditions , including shock , vibration , excessive heat and humidity , and harsh chemical environments . Designers must ensure that mechanical packaging protects against these conditions . General-purpose and specialty CAE software enables engineers to evaluate a host of mechanical and thermal conditions . <p> As all electronics components generate heat by dissipating energy , effective thermal management is fundamentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperatures above 175 Celsius , and their performance degrades rapidly with increased temperatures . Mechanical designers , therefore , must take heat removal into account . Certain operating environments  --  for example , under the hood of an automobile  --  pose particular risks to the integrity and reliability of electronics . Here again , general-purpose and specialty CAE software support a variety of thermal analysis capabilities , such as conduction , convection , and radiation , for a broad range of materials . <p> Manufacturing costs usually exceed design costs by ratios of more than 6:1 . Design innovations that translate to shop floor assembly savings become critical in the extremely competitive electronics market , because they appear quickly on the bottom line . Solids-based CAD and a specialty electronics manufacturing simulation allow for realistic evaluation of shop floor assembly and PCB manufacturing , providing insight to possible improvements . To maintain customer loyalty , products must allow for easy removal and replacement of failed components in the field . Solids-based CAD can effectively evaluate serviceability . In addition , virtual reality software has been demonstrated as a potential method for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical connections between components , such as soldered joints and pins . General-purpose CAE simulation software and specialty CAE software provide tools for predicting probable locations of connector failures . These predictions help designers take proactive steps to guard against failure . <p> All electronics components have minimum power requirements for effective operation . The challenge of reliably predicting satisfactory power distribution crosses both the electrical and mechanical disciplines . Most of the materials used in electronics design , such as ceramics , plastics , semiconductor materials , and solder , exhibit complex temperature-sensitive behaviors . Creep , fatigue , and other related behaviors degrade mechanical and electrical material capabilities over time . Creep causes connectors to lose up to 50 percent of their contact force under high temperatures , and up to 20 percent under extremely low temperatures . Microcracks and other forms of mechanical degradation influence characteristics such as electrical resistance , which can further impact mechanical behaviors ( including creep ) during product operation . Although partially degraded materials can still . support product operation , component life becomes difficult to predict . To date , no well-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few electronics-packaging requirements relate primarily to electrical design , but can have mechanical implications . Design for testability can affect the spatial layout of components and , therefore , the minimum . packaging volume . Shielding from external magnetic radiation and interference , and prevention of harmful electromagnetic radiation leakage are other concerns . Selection and arrangement of materials and components can influence the minimum packaging volume as well as the heat transfer characteristics . These requirements can not be addressed in an isolated fashion . For example , a design proposal that optimizes shop floor assembly might seriously compromise serviceability or other organizational requirements . COMMON MECHANICAL FAILURES <p> Most electronics products fail due to mechanical , rather than electrical , problems . These mechanical failures typically manifest themselves as an electrical short , an electrical open or incomplete circuit , or a circuit that works intermittently . <p> Electrical shorts occur when two or more circuits that should be electrically insulated from each other create a conducting path . The most common cause of catastrophic failures , electrical shorts , sometimes spark fires , because of the excessive heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialty mechanical CAE software are good at detecting shorts that result from mechanical stress . However , today 's software still requires excellent engineering judgment to reliably predict the potential sources of such shorts . No commercial software currently available completely models all the conditions that affect physical behavior . CAE contributes partial solutions for electrical solutions that provide insight when reviewed by experts . For example , general- or special-purpose CAE software may predict deformations , stresses , and temperatures due to structural or thermal loads , yet not identify a potential for shorts . However , shorts could occur if humidity combines with given structural and thermal conditions . In such circumstances , experts familiar with the influence of humidity , or the likelihood of other behavior such as metal migration , ionic contamination , or corrosion , can incorporate the results of CAE-based simulations into their judgments . <p> Electrical opens most commonly result from fatigue or stress-induced fracture cracks caused by mechanical stresses . Open failures can also stem from stresses generated when neighboring dissimilar materials experience different rates of thermal expansion . <p> General-purpose and specialty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failures . The complexity of material behavior , however , makes the actual magnitudes of stresses more difficult to predict . Changes to material properties over time further increase the challenge of quantitative predictions , given the uncertainties and insufficient data on actual material properties . <p> Often , cracking does not completely break or open circuit paths . For example , while fatigue cracking in solder could degrade product performance and increase resistance along the circuit path , it might not cause complete product failure . Instead , the cracked solder from the silicon device to the heat sink breaks the thermal conductive path and accelerates the time to module failure . Effective evaluation of the impact of such cracking requires an ability to simultaneously simulate electronic behavior , heat transfer , and mechanical crack propagation . It remains extremely difficult , if not impossible , to generate such a complex simulation with general-purpose or even specialty commercial CAE software . <p> Intermittent failures frequently appear while the product is operating , but disappear when testing off-line . Bent pins and connectors often cause mechanical intermittent failures . Under vibration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a deformed shape can cause intermittents . For example , pins on a pin grid array are highly susceptible to damage during handling and shipping . To minimize the chance of damaging pins during shipment , manufacturers must pay special attention to packaging . In addition , the vibration characteristics of components with moving elements frequently influence mechanical intermittent failure . <p> CAE simulation can calculate the maximum acceptable loads on pins , as well as the vibration characteristics of components . However , the calculation of mechanical effects on electrical behavior , such as contact resistance , remains difficult if not impossible today . AVOIDING DESIGN MISTAKES WITH CAE <p> Designers seek to minimize space between components in order to satisfy volume constraints for electronics packages . Smaller volume , in turn , affects thermal management , manufacturing , serviceability , and reliable operation of the components . Solids-based CAD enables " first-cut " detection of interference problems across components based on nominal dimensions . Through kinematic analysis and specialty robotic-simulation software , manufacturers can assess manufacturability and serviceability . The figure on page 71 depicts solid models of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect the challenge of assembly within volume constraints . By assigning material behavior to each component , users can quickly estimate physical properties with reasonable accuracy . <p> Component positioning and orientation also influence the quality of soldered connections during the solder reflow process . Connector problems , such as poor solder adhesion , cold joints , and shorts , may occur . Effective simulation of the reflow process requires modeling a complex set of physical effects , including heat transfer , structural characteristics , and the flow characteristics of solder . Commercially available specialty CAE software such as the EDVS SolderSIM module from Pacific Numerix captures this complex behavior . <p> LG Electronics of South Korea adopted Pacific Numerix 's soldering process simulation software to address difficulties arising from higher-density printed circuit boards . When LG Electronics first automated its soldering process with wave solder machines , the component placement and board temperatures affected the quality of soldered connections between components and the board . Engineers encountered a host of solder reflow problems , including DIP ( Dual Inline Package ) shorts , occurring when globs of solder ran into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thermal problems ; component rotation , which furthers soldering problems ; and small holes in the soldered joints . By applying SolderSIM to reposition components , LG Electronics reduced the number of soldering process defects on its electronics boards by 73 percent . <p> Electronics products must be resistant to damage from accidental drops and harmonic excitation . Mechanical impact fractures components and connectors . Over time , cyclic loads , such as harmonic vibration , cause failure from fatigue . More catastrophic cyclic damage occurs if the excitation frequency matches one of the resonant frequencies of the product . <p> Currently , manufacturers often successfully use finite-element-analysis ( FEA ) capabilities to capture the gross characteristics of system behavior from CAD and specialty CAE suppliers , and to make reasonable estimates of lower natural frequency modes . A more accurate evaluation of higher vibration modes , subsystem behavior , and impact analysis would require more detailed finite-element models . To date , general-purpose and specialty CAE software offer the most efficient and reliable means of performing this demanding work . <p> For example , the German television manufacturer Grundig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitiveness . Every year , customers return tens of thousands of televisions because of transportation damage . These returns cost television manufacturers millions of dollars in unnecessary expenses , as well as inflicting damage on their public images . Therefore , television manufacturers must design the casings ' packaging to minimize damage during shipment . <p> However , changing the design directly impacts manufacturing costs . Grundig reports that dies for the front and back of the television casing cost approximately $300,000 apiece . The average cost to make a single change to the die typically runs 10 percent of the original manufacturing cost , or $30,000 . Grundig would save significant time and money if casings were designed correctly before reaching the prototype phase  --  slashing costs on testing iterations and the resulting die changes . The MSC/DropTest simulation provided Grundig with the insight the company needed to improve its design . <p> Inadequate cooling and thermal management occur when engineers fail to understand the ambient thermal operating environment , miscalculate heat generated by components , or underdesign a product for heat removal . Material aging accelerates when materials are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and creep in plastic components and solder joints , stress relaxation of contact and housing material , and diffusion of base materials . Worse yet , junction temperatures exceeding 175 Celsius can cause the total failure of semiconductors . <p> Inherently complex , the effective simulation of thermal cooling involves reliably modeling heat generation , convection , conduction , radiation , and fluid flow . Most general-purpose FEA software packages enable the modeling of heat generation and conduction reasonably well . While engineers can usually identify the locations of hot spots reliably , predictions of the actual temperatures often remain challenging . <p> If engineers have accurate heat transfer coefficients , CAD-integrated and general-purpose FEA software can create effective convection analysis . However , these coefficients  --  which depend on airflow , heat transfer , and geometry characteristics  --  can be complex to determine , and may require supporting fluid-dynamics computations . Specialty CAE software proves most effective for evaluating complex forced and natural convection simulation . <p> Because radiation is modeled as nonlinear behavior , it requires a higher level of expertise with the software . In addition , establishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daunting process . However , engineers can operate effectively with general-purpose or specialty FEA software , if they understand the specific idiosyncrasies of performing nonlinear analysis with their selected product . <p> Thermal expansion mismatch represents another major source of failure . This occurs when two bonded materials expand at different rates because of temperature changes . These differing expansion rates generate high stresses at the interface between the materials . Frequently , failures due to fatigue and thermal cracking result . In most cases , mismatches typically occur at interconnection points such as soldered joints and wire bonds . <p> Any quality thermal-mechanical CAE capability enables the quick evaluation of potential problem spots . However , the thoroughness of the evaluation depends on the detail added to the finite-element model . General-purpose and specialty CAE software offer the most efficient software algorithms , superior model management , and comprehensive material modeling capabilities . <p> Undetected stress concentrations and inadequate stress relief cause connector failures by permitting highly localized loads that exceed the limits of connector materials . For example , abrupt changes in cross-section transitions can create localized stress concentrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most frequently . Without stress relief , crimped and soldered wires subject to tension will often fail . <p> Although standard design practice should avoid such errors , designers can easily overlook some requirements for the multiple connectors present in an electronic product . FEA can detect potential problems . However , engineers must carefully evaluate the magnitude of highly localized stress concentrations . A significant concern is that the dimensions of elements will match characteristic dimensions of the connector material anomalies at the microscopic level , invalidating commonly used stress-based material failure criteria . Therefore , failure prediction should be based on criteria less sensitive to mesh characteristics , such as strain energy or generalized stress intensity factors . <p> To adequately detect trouble spots and stress relief requirements , manufacturers should establish a systematic approach to uncovering trouble spots . One solution would be to deploy a library of parametric finite-element models representing the set of commonly used connectors . Engineers could then select components from the library , saving model creation time . HP-adaptive finite-element analysis from specialty suppliers such as ESRD Would most effectively analyze the joints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress concentrations . <p> Overly flexible PCBs or printed circuit carriers may bend under the weight of their components , producing high stresses at soldered joints that , in turn , create cracks . Excessive bending and torsion of the boards may also occur during manufacturing . And , as the density of components increases on new products , the increased density of pins on a pin grid array causes each pin to become more fragile . Assembly or maintenance , therefore , commonly bends pins and contacts . Linear and nonlinear structural finite-element software available from general-purpose and specialty suppliers provides powerful capabilities for evaluating excessive bending and torsion . Ideally , components and features can be applied from solid models to calculate physical properties and to serve as reference geometry for creating simulation models . <p> By generating stress concentrations at connection locations , overly stiff connectors can accelerate fatigue failure under dynamic conditions . To evaluate structural compliance , engineers can first use random vibration analysis on boards or subsystems , determining potential problem domains . Once they have identified the domains , engineers are then able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leading commercial suppliers of general-purpose finite-element software support structural compliance evaluation . However , it remains challenging and time-consuming to create and update models that match both the component and lead attachment patterns , as well as the irregular edges of boards , holes , and cutouts . Specialty software offers automated capabilities to generate the finite-element models of boards based on component types and their locations . Access to libraries of finite-element models for commonly used connectors further increases productivity . While several general-purpose CAE suppliers permit engineers to build customized environments for automating model creation , specialty suppliers such as Pacific Numerix deliver the specific automated capabilities and connector libraries . <p> Component damage can result from selecting a PCB or printed wiring board size so that one of its mechanical resonant frequencies nearly matches one of the electrically induced frequencies to which it will be subjected . Although PCBs are normally large enough to avoid this problem , engineers can check for potential design failures through finite-element evaluation with any reputable finite-element software . <p> The relative costs of fixing electronics packaging failures increase as the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solids-based CAD helps detect interference problems across components as in these exploded views of a disc drive and a headset . <p> ILLUSTRATION ( COLOR ) <p> By Marc Halpern <p> <p> Marc Halpern is director of research for engineering , manufacturing , and design at D.H .
