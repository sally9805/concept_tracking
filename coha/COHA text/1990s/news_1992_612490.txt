<p> New Orleans - The cool morning rolls up over the Mississippi River , revealing a flock of bulky cargo ships nosing their way to the Gulf of Mexico , 110 miles away . Across the riverbank , the Cafe du Monde fills with local working people starting their day with a New Orleans tradition : beignets and strong , chicory-laced coffee mixed with plenty of milk . <p> It 's winter in the Big Easy , a perfect season to take in the sights that lie beyond Bourbon Street and the French Quarter . The summer tourists and convention crowd are gone and Mardi Gras fever is building . <p> The pace is a little slower - and the weather decidedly better - than in summ er , when crowds , heat and humidity can take their toll on even the most strong-willed visitor . <p> Once known mainly for Bourbon Street jazz , Mardi Gras revelry and Pat O'Brien 's Hurricanes ( a giant alcoholic drink ) , New Orleans has some welcome surprises for visiting families . The world-class Aquarium of the Americas , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstanding entertainment for all ages at reasonable prices . <p> A good home base is one of the smaller hotels in the Uptown district that lies west , or upriver , of the French Quarter . The area is easily accessible via the St. Charles Avenue streetcar and is graced by lovely antebellum and Victorian homes shaded by ancient oak trees . <p> At the comfortable St. Charles Inn , rates for a room with two double beds are $ 60 to $ 85 a night and include a continental breakfast brought to your room . <p> Or consider the Prytania Park Hotel , half a block from the streetcar line , where the beds fold up into the wall , European style , and children can sleep in a loft . Rates are $ 99 a night for a loft room , and children younger than 12 stay free . Each room has a refrigerator and microwave , or you can have a free continental breakfast in the private courtyard . <p> Because parking is scarce and most of the tourist areas in New Orleans are accessible only via narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around town . Leave it in the hotel parking lot and ride on the world 's oldest continuously operating railway , the St. Charles Avenue streetcar . <p> Make the Aquarium of the Americas , on the Mississippi River at the foot of Canal Street , your first stop . Plan to arrive by 9:30 a.m. , when it opens . By late morning or afternoon , this popular destination often is crowded with school groups . <p> The aquarium is divided into four ecosystems : the Gulf of Mexico , the Amazon Rain Forest , a Caribbean Reef and the Mississippi River Delta . " Living in Water , " a gallery with a touch pool and a friendly flock of penguins , shows how fish adapt to an endlessly changing world . <p> The lobby is dominated by a huge waterfall that cascades over a gleaming stainless-steel cliff . Turn the corner and you 're inside a see- through tunnel surrounded by 132,000 gallons of saltwater and hundreds of brilliant , jewel-toned angelfish , living coral reefs , sea horses and 600- pound Southern diamond rays . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tropical sun-lit paradise dazzle the eye . <p> Next , ride up an escalator to the Amazon Rain Forest , a mist-filled replica of the tropical South American river corridor . You 're greeted by Horton and Beignet , resident macaws flying freely throughout the glass- ceilinged enclosure . Native palms and bamboo provide shade for rare air- breathing arapaima fish and a 110-pound anaconda snake . Tucked away in a corner is a separate tank of flesh-eating piranhas . <p> Around the corner , the sociable black-footed penguin colony is a favorite with the crowds . Twice a day , the penguins are fed by hand on their private beach made of kitty litter . At the touch pool , visitors can pick up wiggly hermit crabs and feel the ticklish spines of a sea urchin . <p> An underwater video camera provides spectacular views of sharks . By adjusting the controls to " pan left , " " pan right " or " zoom in , " you can follow the great sharks up close as they patrol their watery home . <p> After seeing the marine life inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulse of the living river outside . Woldenberg Riverfront Park , which extends from the aquarium to Jackson Square in the French Quarter , is dotted with comfortable benches underneath native red swamp myrtle , Southern magnolia and Chinese parasol trees . It is a perfect place to rest for a few minutes and watch the bustling river traffic before heading back up Canal Street to the St. Charles streetcar . <p> The next day , head back to the docks at Woldenberg Park for a riverboat cruise to Audubon Zoo . The boat , named John James Audubon , departs four times a day , beginning at 10 a.m . The 45-minute cruise takes you past the Port of New Orleans , the second busiest in the world , and past the industrial heart of the city . <p> The ride ends at Audubon Park , an elegant 380-acre garden on the site of the 1885 World Centennial Cotton Exhibition . In addition to the zoo , the park has miles of tree-shaded jogging paths , a playground , golf course and tennis courts . <p> The Audubon Zoo houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We think the zoo is a sanctuary for people as well as animals , " says zoo spokeswoman Sara Schilling . With 300-year-old oak trees and a minimum of visible fencing , the zoo is indeed a welcome retreat from the city . <p> Seeing everything at the zoo takes several hours and a lot of walking . Your best bet is to board the Mombasa Railroad for a 30-minute preview of the major exhibits . You can get off and reboard twice on one ticket . Another good idea for families with children is to rent an old- fashioned wood-sided wagon at the main entrance for $ 7 . Tired children can be pulled along without delaying the whole group . <p> The zoo is divided by natural environments into major sections . Grasslands of the World provides a grazing habitat for knobby-kneed giraffes and black bison - at 3,000 pounds , the largest animal in North America - as well as endangered red wolves . <p> Alligators , catfish and snakes inhabit the Louisiana Swamp , a marshy bayou surrounding a trapper 's cabin . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oak veiled with Spanish moss . If you listen closely , you can almost hear the river calling out to you . <p> Wisner Children 's Village , a child-size complex , contains a treehouse , playground , petting zoo and exhibits of smaller animals . <p> If you leave through the main entrance , you can catch a free shuttle bus to the streetcar . As it rolls down St. Charles Avenue , notice the gardens and ornate iron fences , pastel shotgun cottages and restored Victorian mansions . It 's a side of New Orleans you probably did n't know existed . <p> Bourbon Street tackiness ? French Quarter tawdriness ?
