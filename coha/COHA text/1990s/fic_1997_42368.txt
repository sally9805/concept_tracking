Heron Island has just one road . Over this walked Ben Loomis , his whole sturdy figure expressing decided discouragement . <p> As he reached the top of a hill , he saw a small figure flying along the road toward him . It was Jimmy , whom Ben considered his brother , but who was really a little orphan cousin . Now he greeted him breathlessly . Jimmy was nearly always breathing , or talking , at top speed . <p> " Ben ! Ben ! Ollie Simpson is down at the wharf with a horse mackerel . He 's a whopper-five hundred pounds at least . Come along and look at him . Hurry ! " <p> " Where did Ollie get him ? " Ben asked , quickening his steps . The capture of a horse mackerel , that enormous fish often called tuna , was a great event on the island . <p> " Right here , south of Fuller 's Point , " said Jimmy . " He thinks there will be more around here . " <p> For a moment , Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill all winter and spring , and that even now he could only sit in the sun by the doorway ; forgot his own hard work doing odd jobs for the summer folk ; forgot how slowly the money came , and how great was the need . He even forgotfor the moment-the new boat that Mr. Loomis must have before he could hope to earn a living again for his family by fishing , and that this meant one hundred dollars . All the afternoon , at his work , that refrain had haunted Ben . " One hundred dollars ! One hundred dollars ! " <p> They were approaching the wharf and could see the crowd gathered there . They were weighing the huge fish . <p> " Three hundred and ninety pounds , " drawled Asa Smith , who was doing the weighing . " Ai n't sech a big one , after all , Ollie . " <p> " Well , I 'm takin ' it to Portland jest the same . Last I heard , horse mackerel was fetchin ' ten cents a pound . Thirty-nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ollie 's tone was pleased . <p> Ben and Jimmy looked hard at each other . With the reserve typical of island-bred boys , they said nothing until they were well away from the crowd . <p> " Ben ! Ben ! Ca n't we go horse mackerelin ' ? " Jimmy pleaded , fairly prancing along . " Ollie told me once they sometimes weigh as much as seven hundred pounds . Just think , one of those would pretty nearly buy a new boat . " <p> " Seven-hundred-pounders ai n't so very common , Jimmy , " was Ben 's slow-spoken comment , " but I would n't throw away a three-hundredpound feller , would you ? " He asked , grinning at the eager Jimmy . <p> " Then you will go , Ben ? " Ben nodded . <p> " You 'll take me ? " Jimmy held his breath . <p> " I rigger this way , " said Ben slowly . " Young Asa or Sam Field would be glad to go . But then I 'd feel as though they ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two of us had better handle it alone . Ollie will lend us their motorboat , the Mary L. " <p> That afternoon Ben busied himself putting up the harpoon stand on the borrowed boat . Ollie Simpson strolled down to the wharf . " Good idea . I 'll help you nail her up . " <p> The stand was simply a fifteen-foot plank , railed in on three sides , nailed on the bow of the boat like a huge and clumsy bowsprit . At the end of the plank , thrust well out over the water , the watcher would stand , harpoon in hand , looking for the first glimpse of the huge fish , swimming ; close to the surface of the water . <p> " Got your spear ? " asked Ollie . <p> Ben nodded toward the great eight-foot pole , thick as a man 's arm , with the big iron barb on the end . While Ollie made a stout rope fast to the harpoon , Ben coiled the rest around a small keg , taking care that it should unwind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broken rope and a lost fish . <p> Early the following morning , Ben and Jimmy left the cove in their borrowed motorboat . The sun was bright and hot . It promised to be an ideal day for horse mackerel . The big fish only appears on hot , calm days . <p> Perhaps he likes the feel of the sun on his back . Back and forth cruised the Mary L. , but never a glimpse of a big fish rewarded her eager crew . By ten o'clock , Ben turned the bow homeward . <p> Jimmy was so disappointed he could hardly keep from crying . <p> " I thought sure we 'd find a big one this morning . Nobody needs a horse mackerel right now more than we do . " His tone was so mournful that Ben , equally disappointed , under his indifferent appearance , had to smile . <p> " Maybe they 'll come in tomorrow , Jimmy , " he said consolingly . And Jimmy felt comforted . <p> The weather favored them again the next morning . Once out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his eyes anxiously scanning the water for the dark shadow that would betray the big fish , his harpoon ready in his hand . Jimmy , at the tiller , handled the Mary L. surprisingly well . A little motion of Ben 's hand southward caused Jimmy , tense with excitement , to swing the boat in the direction indicated . <p> Dead ahead was a big dark shadow on the water . Jimmy caught his breath . The shadow looked enormous ! If only they could steal up on the huge fish before it became frightened and sank ! <p> Sluggishly he moved along . They were getting close now . Still the huge , finny thing swam , undisturbed . <p> Splash ! The harpoon , hurled with all the strength of Ben 's sturdy arm , found its mark . <p> The huge bulk stiffened , then fairly tore through the water , all sluggishness changed to lightning speed . <p> Sizz-zz ! The rope almost burned its way out of its coil . Ben , white with excitement , all but tumbled out of the stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two boys watched it bobbing and spinning , as the enormous monster tried to rid himself of the harpoon . <p> " Jimmy , I 'll bet he is a seven-hundred-pounder after all , " exclaimed Ben . " Look out ! He 's going up the bay . " <p> Even before Ben got the words out of his mouth , Jimmy had swung the Mary L. up the bay . There was no chance of the sturdy motorboat keeping pace with the express-train speed of the fish . All they could do was to keep the keg , serving as a marker , in sight , and wait until their huge prey weakened . Then they could safely approach the enormous fish . <p> Jimmy was on tiptoe with the thrill of the chase . " Ben , quick ! Speed her up . He 's going out through Cedar Ledges ! Oh , we must n't lose him . " The bobbing keg was tearing through the deep , narrow channel of Cedar Ledges . <p> " I kinder thought he 'd head out to sea , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time , the boys drifted around on the quiet ocean . Once the keg was so far away , it seemed about to slip out of sight . <p> Ben stopped the engine , and Jimmy saw the new boat disappearing with the keg . " Should n't we start , Ben ? Suppose we lose him ? " Ben , on the tip of the stand , watching no less anxiously , turned ' round with a grin and announced , " He 's comin ' back . We 're savin ' gas . " gas . <p> An hour passed this way . Then suddenly the wildly bobbing keg ceased to whirl , and rested quietly on the gentle waves . <p> " Guess he 's done for , Jimmy . Let 's go over and pick him up . " <p> Expertly Jimmy swung the Mary L. up to the keg , while Ben , equally expert , caught its rope with a boat hook , drew the keg in , making the rope fast as he did so . He began to haul , slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whopper ! " Ben shouted . <p> " Did n't I say we 'd get one ? Did n't I ? We 'll sell him , we 'll get- " <p> Crash ! The Mary L. shivered from stem to stern . The rope slid through Ben 's hands , blistering them before he could drop it . Jimmy , flung against the side of the boat , automatically reached for the tiller as he fell . The monster had come to life . The Mary L. boiled along in his wake as he once more tore seaward . <p> The two children recovered themselves . Ben switched off the engine . <p> " Might as well save gas again . " He managed a grin at Jimmy , but made sure a big knife was close by to cut the rope , if need be . <p> " Suppose the harpoon comes out ? " Jimmy asked , his voice shaking . <p> " We 'll lose him , " Ben said . " I ca n't get the keg overboard again . Rope 's too taut . Guess we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There was silence for a while . Straight out to sea went the fish , and straight out to sea went the Mary L. with him . <p> " How-how far will he take us ? " Jimmy asked . " Ca n't tell . " Ben was remembering a tale Ollie told of a four-hour ride in back of a horse mackerel . To be sure , that was in a dory . The Mary L. 's solid weight ought to help . Four hours out to sea would take them a long way from land . " He 's running with the tide , too . Want me to cut him loose , Jimmy ? " <p> Jimmy , true to the breed of fishermen , scanned sea and sky and the receding islands before answering . <p> " Well , I figger- " His tone was a funny , unconscious echo of Ben 's " - it 's a calm day , and we 've got plenty of gas . Let 's go . " <p> They were going , without question . Green Point Light , marking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ahead were the white rips where the swift-flowing Kennebec entered the ocean . Jimmy scanned Ben 's face . The rips were a bad place . But to lose that seven-hundredpounder ! To lose the boat that would help Father and all of them so much ! <p> Were they slowing down ? Jimmy tried to gauge their speed by the distant land . The rope slackened , then drew taut again . The Mary L. swung round sharply . There was a sudden commotion in the water . The huge fish 's last struggle had begun . There was no mistake about it this time . Ben , with strained face , stood ready to cut the rope if the boat were endangered . <p> The struggle took some time . Jimmy , white and awed , found speech difficult . " Ben , I 'm sort of sorry for him , " he said . <p> Ben , with a flash of understanding rare in a lad brought up to consider all the creatures of the deep man 's lawful prey , nodded gravely . <p> " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pa , Jimmy . I guess Pa is really more important . " <p> Jimmy kept his head turned away as the struggle ended , and thought hard of the boat which would make Ben 's father independent and able to earn a living again when he was well . Ben 's steady haul on the rope recalled him , as he drew the great carcass close to the boat , made it fast to the stern , started the engine , and headed for home . <p> As they rounded the wooded end of the island and entered the cove , little Reddy Soames caught sight of the boat and the dark mass towed behind . His shrill voice quickly emptied the post office and general store . When Ben brought his boat alongside the wharf , there was a joyous crowd to welcome and praise him . Many hands helped prepare the fish for the weighing scales . The crowd pressed forward . A little hush fell as Asa Smith leaned forward to read the scales . " Gosh ! Seven hundred and twenty pounds ! " A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm , crying , " Let 's go quick and tell Pa and Ma . I want to be the first . If that Reddy Soames has dared to go- " He looked around anxiously . <p> " Aw , go on yourself , I 'm here , " Reddy pouted , his very red head bobbing indignantly . So , amid the friendly laughter of their neighbors , Ben and Jimmy trudged over the hill toward home , conquerors in every line of their plain little figures . <p>
