LINDA HAD PALE BLUE EYES . They were always opened wide , always looked directly at you . In anyone else they would have seemed a clear sign of an honest soul , unburdened by horrible guilty secrets that had to be kept hidden . By themselves eyes are like marbles ; it 's the face and the expression that cast them sweet or otherwise . I always imagined Linda 's eyes looking paralyzed as she clutched a shaking revolver , small pockets of foam gathering at the corners of her mouth as she stuttered through a garbled salad of words and noises that was meant to be an explanation for why she was about to pull the trigger over and over again until the gun was empty . <p> I remember the first conversation I had with Linda . It was over the phone . <p> I said , " I was just calling to make sure someone would be home Friday night . Ed said that he told you about it . That 's when I 'll be coming over , Friday night . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot longer than he 's known me , and that he owes you a lot , " Linda said , " and that you 're moving in with us for a while , and I have no say in the matter . So-I guess you 're welcome . " <p> I could understand a certain amount of hostility from Linda ; after all , she 'd just moved in with Ed about two weeks before , and they were still pretty much in the honeymoon stage of things . Besides that , it was a tiny apartment . I decided to make an extra effort to get along with her . <p> The two of them met me at the door Friday night . Linda had her arm around Ed . " Wipe your feet , " she said as I was about to step in . When I had them wiped , Ed gave me a hug and Linda shook my hand . She was about twenty , with long , straight , brown hair , a nice shape , and the face of a china doll . Somewhere they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preprinted on them , and they 'd tied them with ribbons all over the couch I 'd be sleeping on . <p> Ed gave me another hug and said , " I wanted you to know you 're welcome . There were times I counted on you because I knew I could . I 'm here now , and you can count on me . " <p> Linda clapped her hands and said , " Hooray ! " <p> They 'd made spaghetti . I could tell Ed had had a hand in the sauce , because it had everything in the refrigerator in it : olives and pepperoni slices and big chunks of cheddar , water chestnuts and artichoke hearts and little , sour cocktail onions . <p> Ed had me relate the nature of my troubles to Linda over dinner . I told how I 'd let my friend Hector move in with me in my old apartment , and how the ex-boyfriend of the girl Hector was dating , a guy named Karl , had followed Hector home one night and found out where we lived . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It was a good story . I 'd managed to work a lot of laughs into it from telling it over and over , once to the guy who fixed the slashed tires on my van , again to the guy who put new glass in my bedroom windows , then to the policeman who came out to take pictures of the bullet holes in Gina 's car . Gina was the girl Hector was dating , the one Karl wanted back . <p> The last part of the story was how we got evicted and how our deposit was eaten up by all the damage Karl had done , and how I now needed a place to sleep until I could save enough for a deposit on my next apartment . <p> Linda listened to the whole story without laughing once . When I was finished she asked , " Do you think this Karl person knows you 're here now ? " <p> About the time I decided I could n't stand anything about Linda , she decided I was all right . I became a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her sister 's husband one night , and that she felt very guilty about it . She also told me that when she started going out with Ed , she 'd still been living with her old boyfriend , Dickie . She felt guilty about that , too . One night she said we were such a nifty family , we should try all sleeping in the same bed . It would be cozy , she said . <p> " You might as well , Alvin , " Ed said . " She 's been talking about it for a while now . " <p> We all went into the bedroom holding hands . Ed rolled over and started snoring . Linda and I kept holding hands . After a while she started feeling me up . The next day she told me she felt guilty about it . <p> Whenever Linda told a deep secret , she sat back in her chair and stared at me , waiting for me to tell one . When I ran out of deep secrets , I started making them up . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'd only had him until I was fifteen , but for Linda 's sake I invented a big , rickety house up in the Appalachians with dozens of deformed or retarded siblings , the products of violent , incestuous urges . The mother I created to please Linda was a huge , hunchbacked woman who carried a squirrel rifle wherever she went and kept a flour sack full of bullets tied to her belt . <p> As I went along , I stole glances at Linda to see how she was receiving the story , checking whether doubt had seeped into those patient , psychopathic eyes of hers . Throughout each story she sat transfixed . Sometimes she 'd interrupt to ask why my father did n't intercede when my mother went on her drunken rages , why he did n't do something when she 'd pick up two of my brothers and knock their heads together until one was unconscious ; how could my father keep himself from stepping in when my mother cast aside the unconscious brother and dragged the remaining one , still whimpering , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd say mysteriously . " Do n't you worry about it ; Dad had his reasons . " <p> " Oh , " Linda would say . Then she 'd nod solemnly and wait for me to continue . Eventually my new family history began to interest me . I even typed it up and sent it to a Stephen King writing contest I saw advertised in a magazine . They never wrote back . <p> When I ran out of stories , I began telling Linda my problems and asking for advice . None of what she said was very helpful ; it almost always required that I turn into a different person . I remember one time she gave me a demonstration of how a guy and his girlfriend should discuss their problems . She held one hand in front of her face , moving the fingers against the thumb as if she had a hand puppet on . The hand 's name was Jenny . Linda spoke for Jenny , giving her a high singsong voice , even higher and singsongier than the voice Linda already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering if we could have a talk . " <p> Then the other hand , Jack , came up and faced Jenny . " Sure , " he said in a gruff voice . <p> " I do n't mean to criticize , " said the Jenny hand , " but all my other boyfriends , well , they used to get little gifts for me , you know , nothing special , just flowers or records or things , just once in a while . " <p> " Well , " said the Jack hand , " I 'm not made out of money . " <p> " Wait a second , " I cut in . " Does Jenny ever bring presents home for Jack ? " <p> Linda gave the Jenny hand a questioning look , then turned back to me and shook her head no . <p> " Well , then why does n't Jack tell her that when she brings him home a steering-wheel puller , he 'll bring her home her goddamn flowers ? " <p> Ed and Linda fought a lot , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking , which was really pretty mild in my estimation . They fought when Linda wanted him to throw out some old piece of trash he was keeping , even though she clung to every old piece of trash she 'd moved into the place . But mostly they fought over who was right and who was a heartless bastard . <p> " Why are you doing it that way ? " was Linda 's favorite question . <p> " It 's a method I invented , " Ed would say , eager to show off his ingenuity . " I keep a little dish of soap next to the sink ; then , when I want to wash a plate , I just wet the scrub brush , dip it in the soap like so , and voila , the plate has its suds . " <p> " It 's better if you fill the sink with soapy water and dip each plate in it . " <p> " Actually , " Ed would say , " tests have been carried out that show when dishes are washed that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up- " any germs present on one dish become suspended in the soapy water and thus spread to the rest of the dishes being washed . " <p> " Not if you keep the water clean . " <p> " How 're you going to keep the water clean if you dump a lot of dirty dishes into it ? " <p> " You rinse them off first . " <p> " That 's not what you do . " <p> " Yes it is , " Linda would say , lying bald-facedly . " Fine ! " Ed would finally say , his body seizing up as he fought the urge to say something vicious . " Fine . " Then he 'd turn away . <p> Linda would stare at Ed for several long seconds , her eyes large and her head slightly tilted . " I just think if we 're going to have a good relationship , we should agree on things . " <p> When the two of them made peace , Ed would turn up the stereo and close the bedroom door . It made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she made a high , squeaking noise at regular intervals , much like a huge , rusted hamster wheel . After a while they took to closing the windows to keep the neighborhood dogs from howling along . <p> I used to lie on the couch in the mornings , long after Ed and Linda had gone off to class or work . I 'd just lie there and let the apartment hold me . The couch was my little island . On the coffee table were those few belongings I had chosen to keep with me : my alarm clock , my knife and whetstone , my penlight , and my westerns . The living room was always littered with Ed 's fencing gear . There were rapiers and epees , steel-mesh masks , and the white armored suit hanging to dry in the window . The place was warm and dark , nothing special , just a comfy hole , somewhere you could take a bath and cook your dinner , a place to get stoned without being nervous , then maybe watch TV until you fell asleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles , that meant something worth killing for . <p> Sometimes I 'd leave early for work , and I 'd stop my motorcycle at the bakery and get a cup of coffee and a couple of rolls . They had a little terrace where you could sit in the morning sun and gaze out at the ocean . I 'd sit and read Zane Grey and think to myself how lucky Ed was to be living in that neighborhood and how unlikely it was that I would be as lucky . <p> " You should point the knives and forks down while they 're drying , " said Linda . " This way 's dangerous . " <p> " How 's it dangerous ? " Ed said . <p> " What if someone was to slip on the kitchen floor and fall on them ? " <p> " What ? They 're going to slip and somehow fall into the sink ? " Their eyes met and held . <p> " It 's dangerous , " Linda replied in a voice that said she was willing to repeat herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Linda was a first-rate nag . Given a chance , she 'd lean over a brain surgeon 's shoulder and tell him he was wasting money throwing away a scalpel when it still had a perfectly good edge . Later , when he was closing , she 'd tell him he was using far too much thread , and if he finally lost his temper , Linda would put on her superior look and say , " Why do n't we talk about it again when you 're not in such a bad mood ? " <p> Linda taught me that nagging defied the law of entropy . Nagging was perpetual motion , a force requiring no reinforcement , impervious to anything placed in its path . Sometimes I marveled that Linda was still with us . It seemed to me that she should not be , that somewhere on death row a man should be sitting , biting his lips and his fingernails , shivering and chattering and crying out to anyone who passed his cell that he had to do it , and if only the jury had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 'd have pensioned him . <p> With each passing day , Ed looked and acted more like that man . You could see the toll Linda was taking on him . She etched and eroded lines into his face as if it were made of sandstone . She was working on the inside of him , too . In the bathroom there appeared larger and larger bottles of Maalox . At first Ed took it a spoonful at a time , but before long he was pouring it down , way more than he was supposed to . His pockets he kept stuffed with Di-Gel and Pepto-Bismol tablets . <p> It was about that time my ship came in . The apartment upstairs opened up . I had an apartment application that I 'd filled out and xeroxed , and I rushed to the manager 's place with a copy . I 'd gotten the original from my boss , an apartment owner and a spitting , seething enemy of rent control . He 'd designed the application himself , and it asked damning questions , the kind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior convictions and seditious organizations . It reminded me of the one my dad filled out at the K Mart gun counter when I was twelve and he was buying me my first Saturday Night Special . I hoped such a form would appeal to the sort of fascist I assumed most managers to be , and I was right . <p> I 'd been living with Ed and Linda for two months . During that time I had locked everything I owned in this big old van a friend had given me . My girlfriend let me keep it parked under her apartment building . Our relationship had been declining for some time , but I had managed to hold things together for the sake of the parking space . The day I got the news that I had been awarded the upstairs apartment , I took the four dollars I had left after paying the deposit and bought a gallon of Red Mountain burgundy . When I had celebrated sufficiently , I climbed on my motorcycle and weaved over to Rosemary 's place . At the front gate I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello ? " Her voice came through the little speaker . <p> " I do n't think we should see each other anymore , " I said . <p> " Who is this ? " she said . <p> " Alvin , " I said . " We both knew this was coming , honey . It 's better that it happens now , while we 're still friends . " <p> " You got the apartment , " she said . <p> " I 'll just get the van , " I said , " and then I 'll be out of your hair . " <p> All the way home I kept imagining that the van was riding low on one side . The sidewalls of the tires had been slashed and patched so many times , and the mass of junk I had in the back was so great , it seemed impossible that this first giant step in my new life would come off without a hitch , but it did . <p> " I do n't know if I should register my van or not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the mattress I used for a bed . The image of her on all fours shrieking like some giant , plucked jungle bird still lingered and was in a strange way arousing . It was lucky the position we 'd chosen left my hands free , for if I had n't clamped them over my ears , I 'm sure I 'd have gone deaf . As it was they were ringing uncomfortably . " I really do n't drive the thing much , only when it rains and I ca n't use my motorcycle . There 's not much chance of me getting pulled over , and if I did , I could just register it then . " <p> " I think you should register it , " Linda said . " I had an aunt once . She was really into drugs . She 'd lost her apartment and was living in this old van with about thirty parking tickets on it . She got paranoid , afraid the police 'd take the van away if they ever found it , so she started hiding it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night she 'd move it to a new hiding place . We had n't heard from her in six months when my dad went looking . A policeman finally found the van in an abandoned car wash . They said she 'd been in there for a long time . All that was left of her was bones and skin and hair . " <p> " I guess I 'd better register my van , " I said . <p> Linda nodded absently . She rolled onto her stomach and picked at a piece of lint in the carpet . " You should vacuum more often , " she said . <p> I let Hector move in , because I 'd promised him we 'd look for an apartment together . Later it got back to me that Gina was feeling put out because I 'd sort of promised that we 'd find a place big enough for the three of us . So I let Gina move in , and suddenly I was living with another couple on their honeymoon , only this time instead of being on the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , except for the mornings . They always woke up before I did , and their dawn romances were liable to go on for a long time . I 'd wake up having to go to the bathroom in the worst way but unable to climb down for fear of embarrassing them . There were a few times I nearly wet the bed . <p> I was sitting at the table with Ed one afternoon when Linda was out . He had begun to look haunted , the muscles in his face cramped into an expression of constant , tearful apprehension . <p> " I do n't know why I let her move in . I guess I was thinking with my dick . " <p> Whenever Ed talked this way I kept quiet , nodding whenever he looked at me . <p> " I thought it would be all right that she was so dense . I said to myself , there are worse things ; you ca n't look down on people just because they are n't as smart as you are . " <p> I nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " I 'd take everything she owns and stack it in one big pile in the living room , " I said . " If that did n't work I 'd move it out to the sidewalk . " <p> " I could n't do that , " Ed said . " I just could n't be that cold to anybody . " <p> " There 's a cobweb up in the corner there . " Linda and I never talked about sex or guilt after we 'd finished our guilty sex . <p> " I do n't kill spiders , " I said . " They eat the other bugs . " <p> " It 's a cobweb , not a spider web . " She let a few seconds go by , and when I did n't answer she said , " Y'know , I used to think that all the trouble Ed and I were having was because you were there . " She looked over her shoulder at me with a puzzled expression . " But now you 're gone , and we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> By then Ed was begging her to leave . Her answer was always the same : " My friends tell me that you 're just going through a phase , and if I stick it out , eventually you 'll realize you really love me . " <p> The Friday before Memorial Day I tried again . " Come on , Ed , " I said . " She 's not going to leave . Crazy people do n't go away just because you tell them to . You have to hit them with a stick or set their hair on fire . Why should she leave ? She 's got you treed . She figures all she has to do is stick to her guns and you 'll move out , and then she 'll have a great apartment . Look , she 's gone for three days ; you 're not coming back until Tuesday . Take me through your place and point to her stuff . I 'll do the rest . " <p> Part of my offer was from true friendship , but there was another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was in love with her , and I knew the power of prediction . There 's nothing mystical about it ; it 's just that when a person says something will happen to you , and says it in a trembling , impassioned voice , there is a special dumbness that takes over , call it self-destructiveness or whatever , but it 's that part of us that refuses to listen to reason , that makes us slow down when we pass a palm reader 's sign , or hold onto a fortune cookie 's message for that extra second while we ask , " Is it really about me ? Does it fit ? " I was afraid Ed would go back to her , begging on heartshaped kneepads . And then I would be the best friend who took advantage of their time of direst trial and bedded the one girl he would ever love . I could n't deal with that guilt . <p> Ed was still thinking about my offer . I topped off his Black Russian and pushed it toward him . <p> " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging on the wall , " and that " - he gestured at a rusted three-speed in the corner . " That " -a taped-up beanbag chair- " and that " -a plaster statue of W. C. Fields- " and . . aw , hell . " He picked up a pink footlocker and carried it into the living room . When he came back he grabbed a lamp that was made completely of popsicle sticks . <p> " What do I carry ? " I yelled after him . He paused and pointed to a big painting of a whale with several harpoons sticking out of it . <p> An hour later we were looking at a pile of Americana that nearly reached the ceiling . There were papier-mache baskets , posters of children with huge , black eyes , whole boxes of potholders , a giant fork and spoon carved from teak , ceramic planters in the shapes of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves , all still half-full of dried potting mix . There were three toasters and two electric frypans , a piggy bank made to look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different colors of melted wax , and a tree stump with Linda 's initials carved in the middle . <p> After Ed left for his weekend , I took the keys I still had to his apartment and went to retrieve the stuffed animals . Then I sat at my dinner table with them , giving them what I called my " bon voyage " treatment . Gina saw me at work and asked if she could help . Gina was a sweet , simple girl , and getting shot at by her old boyfriend had n't spoiled her sense of humor . I handed her a pair of scissors and some colored pens . <p> The first stuffed animal we worked on was a lavender bunny . We put a little paper suitcase in its hand and positioned its arms and legs to make it look like it was walking down the road . We put a backpack on the red-and-white kangaroo and saddlebags on the pale green burro . <p> On the sides of the bags we wrote " Out of Ed 's Life or Bust , " Gina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Linda 's belongings . We made a long line of them , each posed with its paw waving in a gesture of happy good-bye . <p> Over the Memorial Day weekend , things got a little out of hand at my place . Saturday night there was a poker game , a fistfight , and a small fire . Sunday night was much the same , but I missed a big portion of it by passing out on the couch I 'd just picked up at the Salvation Army . <p> When I opened my eyes Monday morning , I was naked except for a pair of gym shorts and a puddle of vomit-my own I assumed-nearly covering my chest . If I turned one way or the other it would have spilled onto my new couch . After some thought I came up with a plan to crawl on my back into the shower . As I attempted it , though , I noticed the stuff on my chest had a viscosity different from that of normal vomit . I dipped my finger into it and tasted . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw an empty jar of the stuff on the dinner table with two spoons and a knife sticking out of it . I pictured my three drunken friends the night before , concentrating as they spread marmalade over my chest , commenting about what a deep state of unconsciousness I had achieved . <p> My discovery did n't make my predicament any easier , and I was just resuming my spider-crawl into the bathroom when Hector and Gina , who 'd been down in Covina visiting Gina 's mother , came through the door . Hector started laughing . Gina looked horrified . <p> " It 's not what you think , " I said . " It 's marmalade . " <p> " Oh , " she said , looking no less shocked . <p> " I 'll tell you about it when I get out of the shower , " I said . <p> When I got out of the shower , though , Hector was waiting for me with the telephone . I took it and heard Linda 's voice say , " Is this Alvin ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I made Hector come with me for moral support . On the way downstairs I feverishly went over the things I was going to tell Linda . I figured she wanted to see if I was at the bottom of her special homecoming . If she was able to convince herself I was , she 'd have an excuse to stay on , figuring Ed was just a wimp who 'd been pushed into such a thing . <p> Linda met us at the door . She was watching my face as I stepped into the living room . I made my eyes bulge wide and said , " My God , what happened here ? " <p> She looked at me , not sure what to believe , and demanded , " Is this new to you ? Have you seen this before ? " <p> " Christ , " I said with wonder in my voice . " Did Ed do this ? " <p> " I guess he must have . " She looked defeated . <p> Hector was standing near the door , doing his damnedest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing battle . He was beginning to look desperate when he saw the fencing helmet on the couch . He grabbed it and put it on . <p> " I come back from my vacation , and this is what I find , " Linda said . " And this is n't everything-he took my stuffed animals and taped rude little notes to them ! " <p> I heard a wheeze come out of the fencing mask . <p> " What are you going to do ? " I said , doing my best to sound concerned for her safety . <p> " I do n't know , " she said . " I keep wondering , if a person did all of this , what else could he do ? He might try to kill me . " <p> " I think he might , " I said . <p> Hector was shaking badly . He stumbled to the couch and sat down . <p> We found out later that just before Ed left , he 'd been looking for an overdue electric bill , and he 'd moved a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't noticed that he 'd put the papers next to the litter box , and the cat , who was n't very bright to start with , got confused . <p> " Do you know what else he did ? " Linda said to me . " I think he shit on some of my papers . " <p> By now Hector was bent over , holding his stomach , but he still managed to gasp out , " It sounds like Ed to mel " <p> My van was full again , fuller than it had ever been , as we headed to Linda 's new apartment . I kept imagining a scenario in which my tires all exploded at once and Ed went running out into the night , tearing at his hair , leaving me stranded with Linda for the rest of my life . <p> We parked in front of a large , square stucco building and unloaded Linda 's stuff without incident . <p> On the way home we were quiet . Ed hunched against the window , arms wrapped around his knees , staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I did n't bother him . <p> In about two months my old girlfriend , Rosemary , would move in with Ed ; then , after several weeks of building anger and jealousy , I 'd stagger into a dinner party they were throwing and start a shouting match , and we would n't speak to each other much after that . A month after the shouting match , Hector and Gina would bring home a Siberian husky puppy and I would throw them out , and that would be the end of that . At that moment in the van , though , I was thinking about what a good friend I 'd been to Ed once again , and about the vacuum that big problems leave in their wake . <p> We were two men suddenly single , relieved and silent , and we were going home . <p>
