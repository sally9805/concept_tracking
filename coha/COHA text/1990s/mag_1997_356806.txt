Like a parent whose toddler is wobbling eagerly toward a wedding cake , etiquette can move fast when it has to . People think they can get away with using their cellular telephones at any time or place they choose , confident that etiquette is too befuddled by this wondrous novelty to set limits . <P> They are dangerously mistaken . <P> Perhaps there was a two-minute lag between the purchase of the first cell phone and the establishment of etiquette rules against using the device at the dinner table , taking calls while attending a concert , or making calls from a pew during religious services . But that was only because it was hard to believe that anyone would try . Nobody doubts this any longer . Yet these situations are already covered by the broader mandates of manners that have always applied . Annoying people by making disruptive noises has been on that list since the human body first learned to make nasty sounds on purpose . <P> Using a telephone to increase the range in which one can be rude is n't new either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion of peace and privacy . For years it has tyrannized people 's lives with the premise that its jangling summons requires them to drop whatever they are doing and attend to it immediately . And they do . Lovers leave sweethearts with their outstretched arms and business people leave customers with their outstretched wallets . <P> We 've all heard the standard excuses for the rude use of cell phones : attending to business and being available for personal emergencies . But these have been so overused and misused as to be hardly acceptable anyway . People who are on call for work or personal crises probably should n't be out socializing or entertaining themselves , and they certainly should n't be disrupting these activities for the less burdened . <P> However , the accusations of rudeness being made against the owners of cellular telephones are often unfair . " They 're just showing off , " is the charge hurled at people who use their cell phones to do what everybody else is legitimately doing  --  talking on the bus , making calls from the sidewalk , chatting while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a status symbol  --  but so are a lot of other things that are less obviously useful yet do n't arouse public ire . It should be recognized that the cell phone is just a tool . What determines rudeness is how it is used . People who need to shout into their cell phone probably just need a better phone , but shouting itself is already an etiquette violation . <P> There is a truly new etiquette rule on the books , especially for mobile phones , although even it has a historic precedent . In the old postal system , which charged the recipient rather than the sender , the polite letter writer was supposed to be reasonably sure the communication would be welcome and to compress the missive so as to keep the cost down . Now the polite telephoner is obligated to restrict the number and length of calls to mobile users , knowing the recipient incurs costs . <P> If there 's anything ruder than disturbing people , it 's making them pay for being disturbed . <P> The always polite Judith Martin is a syndicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Communication ( Crown ) .
