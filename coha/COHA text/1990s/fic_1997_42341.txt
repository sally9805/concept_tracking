Steven returned from the war without lips . <p> This is quite a shock said his wife Mary who had spent the last six months knitting sweaters and avoiding a certain grocery store where a certain young man worked and looked at her in that certain way . I expected lips . Dead or alive , but with lips . <p> Steven went into the living room where his old favorite chair stood , neatly dusted and unused . I-can-eat-like-normal , he said in a strange halted clacking tone due to the plastic disc that covered and protected what was left of his mouth like the end of a pacifier . **61;815;TOOLONG . Skin-from-my-palm . He lifted up his hand and looked at it . Thatwill-work , I-guess , he said . **31;878;TOOLONG . <p> No , said Mary , it wo n't . That bomb , she said , standing on the other side of the chair , you know it took the last real kiss from you forever , and as far as I can remember , that kiss was supposed to be mine . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her raised nipples like a UFO and the plastic was cool on her skin . It felt like they were in college and toying with desk items as sexual objects . Her boyfriend of that time , Hank : Let 's try a ruler . Let 's measure you , Mary . Let 's balance a paperweight on my dick . I 'm over that , Mary thought . I want lips now . I just want the basics . <p> She did n't say anything , but began to shop at the other grocery store again . <p> The young man there had always had lips but now they seemed twice as large and full and incredible , as if his face was overflowing with lip . While he ran her milk and eggs and toothpaste over the electronic sensor , she could n't stop looking at them , guessing what they tasted like . The warm , salty taste of flesh . <p> Good to see you , he said , moving those lips . It 's been awhile . <p> Mary blushed and fiddled with the gum at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her . I wo n't tell . <p> Really ? She looked at the flavors and picked cinnamon . <p> Sure , he said , smiling at her , glancing around to see if his manager was in sight . Think of me while you chew . <p> She blushed again , pocketed the gum and then grabbed her two full bags in both arms . <p> Need help ? he asked , let me help you . <p> Okay . She passed the weight to him , and he walked her to the car which was parked near the river . While he placed the bags into the trunk , she was taken by the desire to join them . She wanted to sit in there and invite the man in with her , shut the trunk down and lock it and just make love and eat groceries until they suffocated or her husband needed the car . <p> Back at home , Steven was in the bathroom , looking at himself in the mirror . Mary stood and watched him touching the disc with his fingertips , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned around . <p> Honey , he said , back-so-soon ! He took the bags from her , peered inside them and - oohed-  and - aahed-  over her food choices . <p> Oh-Mary , he said , God , -I-missed-you-so-much . In-that-ditch , when-I-thought-of-you , I-saw-an-angel . His voice broke . I-sawMary , my-angel , in-this-house , with-these-bags . You-brought-meback-home . He reached out his hand and fingers trickled down her arm . <p> She kept her back to him and shoved tin cans into the cupboard . Maybe , she was thinking , if you 'd concentrated better you 'd still have lips . Maybe you 're not supposed to think of your wife at the market while people are throwing bombs at you . Maybe you 're supposed to protect certain body parts so she 'll be happy when you come back . <p> But instead she just piled the cans one on the other , edge to edge in tall buildings , kidney beans on top of tuna . She turned to Steven . <p> You 're alive , she said , and hugged him . You 're Steven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed her , - , and she held herself in and tried not to shatter . <p> Steven ate more than she remembered so she was back at the market in two days . The young man was there , and she offered him a stick of the same cinnamon gum . He grinned at her . <p> Thanks , he said , taking a piece . <p> She touched the back of his hand while he was writing her drivers license number on the check , and said Do you take care of yourself ? <p> He looked up at her . What do you mean ? <p> I mean , what if they called you to fight in the war ? Her hand was stilled on his . <p> He snapped his gum . He drew a little gun on a corner of her check . No , he said , I do n't think I would do it . I think I 'd run away , because , you know , I do n't want to fight in the war . I mean , how would you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He drew little bullets coming out of the gun and sliding down the side of the check , near where her name and address were printed . Mary nodded and placed her license back into her wallet . I know , she said , me too . I would move away somewhere else . I would n't leave people and maybe never come back . You ca n't do that to people , you know ? <p> Right , he said , looking up at her : I know what you mean . The most unbearable thing is losing someone like that . <p> Oh no , she said to him , wrapping the plastic handle of the bag around her wrist several times , I do n't think so . I do n't agree . The most unbearable thing I think by far , she said , is hope . <p> At night Steven twitched with nightmares . He never used to ; he used to sleep straight through the night , and Mary would carve shapes into his back with her stub of a fingernail and watch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was bucking in and out of the sheets and she still carved the shapes and the goosebumps still emerged , but they did n't calm him . She wondered what he was seeing . Sometimes she woke him up . <p> Steven , she said , it 's okay . You 're here . You 're back . <p> He looked up at her with a frame of sweat around his face and breathed out . - Mary-  , he clacked , it's-Mary . <p> It 's Mary , she said . Yes . That 's me . <p> He held her so tightly she was uncomfortable . She wiggled loose and finally fell asleep for a couple of hours but woke up again in the middle of the night and left the bedroom . Steven was sleeping quietly , his back to her , arm out , palm open , belly sloping down to the sheets . She tried the TV but everything was either without plot or in the middle so she could n't understand what was going on . Clicking it off , she went and sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its red paint chipping . The sky was oddly light , but it was nowhere near morning . <p> Leaning down into the dirt , she began to dig a hole . The dirt was grainy and soft and lifted out easily , and she wondered why she never took up gardening . It 's supposed to be so soothing , she thought . Perhaps that is the soothing that I need . <p> She leaned down into the dirt and dug until there was a hole a few feet deep . She placed her feet in it . <p> I built this hole , she said , now what to put in it ? She wandered in through the kitchen to the hall closet , opened it , and saw the three sweaters she knit for Steven At War piled on the shelf by the sewing machine . There , she said , my sweaters . He wo n't want these . No one wears sweaters here anyway . <p> She lugged all three sweaters outside and gently folded them , placing them on top of each other in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thread about Steven , pretending she was keeping him alive although she knew he was dead . He had to be dead . She was just more honest with herself than the other wives . With each purl and knit and knot , she felt the coldness of his stiffening legs , the draining of color from his cheeks , knew that never would she feel his forearms warm and veined around her waist , never again would his voice whisper praise into her ear . <p> She let the dirt dribble through her fingers over the pile of sweaters and it slid down the sides , slowly filling up the space , covering the colorful sleeves . Dead sweaters , she thought . Is n't that funny , the way it turned out ? <p> At the grocery store , the young man was wearing a gray button-up shirt and looked particularly handsome . <p> I was hoping you 'd come in , he told her . I was thinking about you . <p> Really ? His skin was so young , so new . <p> I get off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch . Do you want to go on a walk or something ? We 're right by the river and I could use a break before I go home . <p> She watched the bag-packer put the eggs haphazardly on top . <p> Sure , she said . Why not . <p> She packed the bags in her trunk again and after a beat , pulled out the bouquet of gardenias that she 'd bought because they 'd smelled so strong . She waited for the young man , feeling like a bride . After a minute , he exited the store without his apron , let loose , looking younger . <p> This way , he said , come this way . Nice flowers . <p> She felt embarrassed and asked him to hold them for her , which he did , blooms down . They walked side by side and she was aware of his breathing , easy and confident , and aware of his lips . Lips , she thought . I really really miss lips . <p> The river leapt over stones , gurgling as rivers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young man told her about his life , about how this was his summer job away from college and one day he wanted to own an art supply store . Interesting , she told him , that will be an interesting store to own . You will buy many different colors of paint . <p> Yeah , he said . I like paint . <p> The river was speeding up . It made a rushing noise , rocks breaking up the water into foam . <p> I want to throw myself in , she thought . I want to crack up on those rocks . <p> She looked at the young man . <p> Can you swim ? she asked . <p> Oh , yeah , he said . I 'm a great swimmer . <p> Would you rescue me , she said , if I went in ? Because I 'm not a good swimmer . <p> Went in that ? He pointed to the river just in case there was a choice he did n't know about . It 's cold in that , he said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you ca n't swim . <p> But , like I said , she said , would you save me ? <p> He seemed confused . This was not what he expected from her . I guess I 'd try , he said , you know , if it was really dangerous . He took a step back . She walked to him . <p> I 'm glad , she said . <p> He stepped down to a lower plane so he was suddenly her height and she moved into his face and kissed those lips , reminded herself . They were so soft . She kissed him for a moment , and then she had to move away ; they were too soft , the softness was killing her . <p> Hey , said the young man , nice . <p> Mary sat down on the ground and felt as if she could not possibly survive with something that soft in the world with her . The two of them could not exist together . No . The young man sat down , he wanted to kiss her again but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you I was married ? <p> No , he said , I did n't know you were married . He looked to her hand and pointed to the ring . Oh , right . Check it out . Cool . <p> She thought about Steven and the disc and about pressing her lips down on those plastic curves , pushing hard on them until she pressed her face into his . Pushed past his skin and through his bone and into the quiet warm space underneath , her eyes shut , cell to cell , both unarmed . In there , she thought , inside his mind and flooded with blood , without windows or doors or her knitting or his chair , maybe in there she could hold their faces in her hands and consider something like forgiveness . <p> She stood up and the young man reached out his unflowered hand , wanting to pull her to him , wanting her attention again . Really , he said , I would rescue you , you know , what you were saying before . <p> Yeah , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She started back along the path and he followed her . He was so young , he just talked about himself again and she tuned out and watched the shadows of the trees cut lines into the ground . She kicked a few rocks . Back in the parking lot , she held out her hand and grasped his for a second . He had a firm grip . <p> Come back , I 'll give you more free gum , he said , handing her back her flowers . <p> Okay , she said , I can always use free gum . <p> He walked away , looking confused , not really sure what happened , if he was rejected or not . Mary threw the gardenias into the passenger seat , climbed into her car and drove home . She forgot the rest of the groceries and left them in the trunk . Later , when she went to get them , it was only the milk that had spoiled , releasing its warm dank odor on the air . <p> Instead she scooped up the flowers and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking a nap . She stood above him and watched him twitch , his hands fluttering as if he 'd been drugged . He was in her house : her husband , the love of her life . He was back . He made it . He left ; he returned . She wanted to know him again , to enter the nightmare and be in there with him , to fight the demons with her own good weapons . She wanted to join him , but the chair was too small and his brain was his only and all she saw in the ditch were sweaters and a too-light sky . <p> She reached out to shake him awake but her hand stopped in the air and would n't go farther . No hand was reaching out for her . Stirring in his sleep , he let out a clipped yell . Mary kneeled on the carpet . <p> Steven , she whispered , I miss you so , but everything is fine at home . <p> Steven , she said , the neighbors got a dog and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Removing the plastic wrap , she very carefully kissed the bouquet of gardenias and then placed it onto his stomach . <p> Here love , she said , I brought you some flowers . <p> She kept her head low . Steven stirred and eyes blinking , woke up to the smell of the gardenias . <p> - Mary-  , he said , - flowers-  , how-beautiful . <p> She put her hands over her ears and started to cry . <p>
