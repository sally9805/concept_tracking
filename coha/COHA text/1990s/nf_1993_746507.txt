Independent state constitutionalism is a venerable tradition in New York. 1 Safeguarding fundamental rights and liberties on the basis of New York law  --  regardless of the federal  --  is at least as old as the state 's highest tribunal . Indeed , New York 's Court of Appeals began to build a record of independent state-based adjudication in the years immediately following its inception. 2 <p> Throughout its history , the New York court has seemed ever mindful of its independence and , particularly , of its obligation to be independent in expounding New York 's fundamental law. 3 From the start , it often ventured where the federal Supreme Court had not yet been. 4 Sometimes it differed openly with Supreme Court doctrine. 5 Typically , it did so with the confidence of a court of last resort , sure of its place in the federal system of government and well aware of its duty to uphold the state  --  as well as the federal  --  constitution. 6 As expressed almost matter of factly , half a century ago by Chief Judge Irving Lehman in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People v. Barber : <p> Parentherically we may point out that in determining the scope and effect of the guarantees of fundamental rights of the individual in the Constitution of the State of New York , this Court is bound to exercise its independent judgment and is not bound by a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States limiting the scope of similar guarantees in the Constitution of the United States. 7 <p> That oft-cited passage has been a veritable credo for state constitutional adjudication in New York  --  and it should be for all states . Even during the Warren revolution at the Supreme Court , when it became customary for most state courts simply to follow the lead of the new federal dictates , the New York Court of Appeals continued to set its own standards , especially in the area of criminal procedure and most notably with regard to self incrimination and the assistance of counsel. 8 <p> So , for example , in the 1963 decision in People v. Donovan , the court extended the right to counsel to custodial questioning prior to the commencement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confession from a suspect whose attorney had been denied access to him. 9 Speaking for an unanimous court , Judge ( later Chief Judge ) Stanley H. Fuld asserted that it was " unnecessary to consider whether or not the Supreme Court " would extend the right to counsel that far. 10 <p> Similarly , in People v. Wintenski , 11 one of several related New York decisions rendered prior to the Supreme Court 's Miranda 12 landmark , the Court of Appeals emphatically reaffirmed its previously established requirement for pre-interrogation warnings to protect accused being subjected to questioning without the assistance of an attorney. 13 It was futile for the prosecution to argue that the Supreme Court had never , yet , mandated such a safeguard . Speaking through Chief Judge Charles S. Desmond , the New York court simply noted that " we must not forget that in our State the right to counsel was announced and insisted upon in much older case law . " 14 By the end of the Warren era , it could fairly be said that New York 's independent state constitutional rulings were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of the accused than the revolutionary decisions of the Supreme Court. 15 <p> In ( he post-Warren era , state constitutional adjudication at the Court of Appeals proceeded apace . Under Chief Judges Charles D. Brietel and especially Lawrence H. Cooke , the court continued to extend state constitutional protections of rights and liberties. 16 Indeed , as the Supreme Court began increasingly to backpedal on individual freedoms as a matter of federal constitutional law , the Court of Appeals seemed even more resolute to chart its own course. 17 Building on prior New York case law rather than merely reacting to Supreme Court " retrenchment , " the New York court remained true to its state constitutional tradition . <p> Currently , with William H. Rehnquist at the helm of the Supreme Court and state constitutional law being touted , welcomed , applied , and in other ways fully revived nationwide as an antidote to " conservative " federal rulings , 18 the Court of Appeals is viewed by many commentators as a leader in the state constitutional movement. 19 To be sure , that leadership has recently been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprisingly unsure of its direction , its role in our federal system , and even its commitment to independent state constitutional law. 20 Nevertheless  --  and perhaps because of its unevenness and apparent uncertainty  --  the Court of Appeals today provides a particularly illuminating and fascinating subject for study. 21 <p> The successes and failures of state constitutional decision making ; its promise and performance ; the arguments , pro and con ; the application , manipulation , and even rejection of independent state law  --  all these are present in recent Court of Appeals 's decisions . An examination of these decisions provides insights not only into current constitutional adjudication at the New York court , but also into many of the contemporary issues of state-based decision making with which state courts throughout the nation are wrestling . <p> Four decisions have been selected here as focal points for discussion Each is notable both for the substance of the court 's ruling and for what is revealed about the current state of state constitutional adjudication in New York and elsewhere . IMMUNO A.G. v. MOOR-JANKOWSKI <p> In Immuno II , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court , adopted an independent New York standard for distinguishing actionable defamation from state constitutionally protected opinion. 23 The test  --  " whether , viewed as a whole and in context , the reasonable reader would have believed that the challenged statements were conveying facts about the libel plaintiff " 24  --  was applied to dismiss an action against the editor of a scientific journal who published a letter criticizing a biomedical researcher 's experimentation with chimpanzees. 25 <p> The New York test is arguably more stringent than that which had just been articulated by the Supreme Court in Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co. 26 There , the nation 's high court held that the federal First Amendment did not provide blanket immunity for every statement that could be labelled " opinion . " 27 Rather , even on matters of public concern , a statement that contains " provably false lactual connotations " might be actionable. 28 <p> The Court of Appeals , speaking through Judge Judith S. Kaye , explained how the " difference between the state and federal tests is more than theoretical . " 29 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " fine parsing " of a challenged communication  --  the " isolating " and " extracting " of statements out of context  --  that could well " result in identifying many more implied factual and therefore actionable assertions . " 30 According to the court . the state 's standard , " taking into account the full content of the challenged speech " rather than permitting a search for some provably false assertions , better assures the " full and vigorous exposition and expression of opinion on matters of public interest . " 31 <p> The Court of Appeals said that such a highly protective standard is especially appropriate for New York because of its cultural and legal tradition. 32 As the court explained : 33 <p> This State , a cultural center for the Nation , has long provided a hospitable climate for the free exchange of ideas . That tradition is embodied in the free speech guarantee of he New York State Constitution , beginning with the ringing declaration that " every citizen may freely speak , write and publish . . . sentiments on all subjects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional provision in 1821 , reflect the deliberate choice of the Nev , York State Constitutional Convention not to follow the language of the First Amendment , ratified thirty years earlier . but instead to set forth our basic democratic ideal of liberty of the press in strong affirmative terms .... Thus . . . the protection afforded by the guarantees of free press md speech in the New York Constitution is often broader often the minimum required by the federal constitution. 34 <p> It is not surprising then , as the Court of Appeals said , that it would " look to New York 's State law because of the nature of the issue in controversy  --  liberty of the press  --  where this State has its own exceptional history and rich tradition . " 35 What is surprising or at least curious , however , is that the court would have originally decided the case on the basis of federal law  --  or to be more precise . on its interpretation of federal case law. 36 In its first opinion , prior to vacatur and remand by the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core values protected by the State and Federal Constitutions. " 37 But , review of the court 's opinion in Immuno I reveals unmistakably that the court 's decision in fact rested on federal law. 38 And as Judge Richard D. Simons later noted in Immuno II , the " original decision contained no statement that it rested on independent state grounds . " 39 Not until the second time around , after the Supreme Court had directed reconsideration of Immuno I in light of its intervening decision in Milkovich , 40 did the Court of Appeals consider a " separate and independent " " State law analysis . " 41 <p> This instance of " state constitutional law on the rebound " is not unusual in recent years . In fact , one commentator has found this " reactionary " or " reactive " approach42 to be the " dominant tendency " of the current court. 43 Indeed , the Court of Appeals has , over the last several years , been deciding many diffcult constitutional rights questions on the basis of federal law , turning to the state constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court affirmance. 44 <p> This approach would appear to conform to the view of the court 's chief judge during this period , Sol Wachtler , 45 for whom state constitutional law seemed primarily a " supplement " or corrective to federal case law. 46 This predominantly " instrumentalist " attitude toward state constitutional law was expressed bluntly by Wachtler himself a few years ago when he remarked , " In those instances where we think the Supreme Court Justices are dead wrong , we go back to our own constitution . " 47 But such selective reason to the state constitution is subject to the criticism that it provides no principled basis for developing a state jurisprudence . As one commentator has argued , it reduces the state 's fundamental law to little more than a " grab bag " of provisions to be " exploited in order to circumvent disfavored United States Supreme Court decisions " or to obtain some other desired objective. 48 <p> Judge Richard D. Simons registered a similar complaint when he recently protested that the Court of Appeals ought not to create a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " merely because it disagrees with the Supreme Court 's decisions or dislikes the result reached . " 49 Simons disagreed with the court 's resort to the state constitution in Immuno II ; he believed the federal rule was sufficient to decide the case . His application of independent state law might be characterized as " reactive " in some cases. 50 But his approach to constitutional decision making-really a " federal law first " approach that , in the first instance , addresses federal law and welcomes Supreme Court review-seems predicated on an institutional view of state courts in the federal system . Thus he argued in Immuno II : <p> When Federal questions are presented , the Court of Appeals 's institutional functions are subordinated to the Supreme Court and it acts , in effect , as an intermediate court . . . . It is important that State courts participate in the Nation 's court structure . They have much to contribute to the Supreme Count 's determination of Federal law by addressing the issues thoroughly and persuasively and providing local perspectives for the development of constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ultimate responsibility for pronouncing federal law , however , it should be given the opportunity to accept , modify or relect a State court 's determination of what the Federal Constitution requires. 51 <p> Hence , Simons 's position in Immuno II was that the Court of Appeals should have simply applied Milkovich ; as the federal standard was sufficiently stringent to bar the defamation action , there was no need for the majority to resort to state law. 52 Of course , Simons was indisputedly correct that it was " unnecessary " for the court to apply both federal and state law analyses . " But that is what it did . The majority opinion first analyzed the Supreme Court 's Milkovich decision and held that the letter in question was protected by federal free expression. 54 The majority then proceeded to develop a state standard under which , it held , the letter was also protected. 55 <p> This so-called " dual reliance " approach , 56 in which a constitutional issue is resolved under both federal and state law , surely generates advisory opinions-either the federal or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained in Immuno II , dual reliance insulates a state court 's federal decision from Supreme Court review , because the state court 's separate state decision being adequate itself , precludes federal jurisdiction. 58 <p> Judge Kaye herself would have been expected to oppose dual reliance. 59 She had previously concurred separately in a free press decision solely to object to the court 's application of federal , as well as state , law. 60 She asserted that , because free expression issues " peculiarly implicate local concerns and standards " and because New York has a " consistent tradition " of the " broadest possible protection , " the case should have been " resolved under the State Constitution alone . " 61 <p> In Immuno II , noting that the court had not settled upon any single methodology , she argued that the " proper approach may vary with the circumstances . " 62 She somewhat cryptically maintained that dual reliance was appropriate because of the case 's unusual procedural posture. 63 It may be , however , especially in light of Kaye 's expressed preference for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making dual reliance appropriate in Immunao II had more to do with the dynamics of a collegial body and the compromises necessary to fashion a majority opinion . <p> That possibility seems especially likely in view of the sharp divisions within the court over the use of state constitutional law. 64 Indeed , deep rifts were revealed most starkly in the companion decisions in People v. Scott65 and People v. Keta , 66 when the court 's members argued vehemently over the very bona fides of independent state constitutional adjudication itself . To those decisions we now turn . PEOPLE v. SCOTT , PEOPLE v. KETA <p> In Scott and Keta , the Court of Appeals refused to adopt two Supreme Court search and seizure decisions as state constitutional doctrine . In Scott , the issue was the expectation of privacy in " open fields "  --  areas outside the immediate vicinity of the land owner 's residence. 67 In keta , the related question dealt with the random " administrative " inspection of vehicle-dismantling businesses. 68 In both cases , by a bare 4 to 3 majority , the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the federal precedents . More significantly , however , a bare majority fended off a remarkably unrestrained assault by the dissent against independent state constitutionalism . <p> In Scott , the Court of Appeals invalidated a warrant-less search of private residential land that was welt marked with no-trespassing signs . The lower tribunals had simply applied Oliver v. United States , a Supreme Court decision that held that there was no Fourth Amendment protection on " open fields , " regardless of the owner 's efforts to assure privacy with signs or fences. 69 The Court of Appeals 's majority , however , speaking through Judge Stewart F. Hancock , Jr. , rejected the Oliver ruling as New York law : <p> We believe that under the law of this State the citizens are entitled to more protection . The constitutional rule which permits State agents to invade private lands for no reason at all  --  without permission and in outright disregard of the owner 's efforts to maintain privacy by fencing or posting signs  --  is one that we can not accept as adequately preserving fundamental rights of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an expectation of privacy in open land is repugnant to New York 's acceptance of the right to be let atone as a fundamental right deserving legal protection. 70 <p> In Keta , the Court of Appeals invalidated a statute authorizing warrantless searches of vehicle-dismantling businesses . The Supreme Court , in New York v. Burger , 71 had sustained the statute against Fourth Amendment challenge , reasoning that the searches served substantial administrative objectives in supervising a closely regulated industry. 72 But the Court of Appeals adhered to the views it had expressed earlier in the Burger case prior to the Supreme Court 's reversal. 73 Speaking through Judge Vito J. Titone , the Keta majority explained : <p> The constitutional rules governing administrative searches must be narrowly and precisely tailored to prevent the subversion of the basic privacy values embodied in our Constitution . Because the principles and standards set forth in New York v. Burger ( supra ) do not adequately serve those values , we decline to accept them as controlling in interpreting our own constitutional guarantees .... The so-called " administrative search " exception to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be invoked where , as here , the search is " undertaken solely to uncover evidence of criminality " and the underlying regulatory scheme is " in reality , designed simply to give the police an expedient means of enforcing penal sanctions . " . Otherwise the exception would swallow up the rule and permit circumvention of the traditional probable cause and warrant requirements where their protections are most needed. 74 <p> Dissenting in both cases , Judge Joseph W. Bellacosa , joined by Wachtler and Simons , authored a single opinion notable for its bitterness and unreserved hostility to the majority 's reliance on state constitutional law . " The Court 's declaration of independence from the Supreme Law of the Land , " the dissent fumed , " propels the Court across a jurisprudential Rubicon into a kind of Articles of Confederation time warp " sic. 75 <p> The dissent objected that the majority had improperly " rejected uniformity " with federal law and " discarded the United States Supreme Court 's guidance . " 76 It complained that there was no " justifiable basis " for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were no " sufficient reasons " supporting a " departure " from Supreme Court decisions. 77 Though the dissenters insisted that they " do not object to the conferral of State constitutional rights to individuals , " 78 the entire tenor and emphasis of the dissenting opinion evinces precisely the opposite. 79 <p> As Hancock noted in Scott , " the dissent 's distress is not only with this decision but with the general concept of State constitutionalism . " 80 And Titone in Keta felt compelled to point out that " we  --  consistent with well settled principles of federalism  --  are not bound by decisions of the Supreme Court construing similar provisions of the Federal Constitution notwithstanding the dissent 's vigorously pressed argument to the contrary . " 81 Moreover , Titone had to remind the dissenters that the Court of Appeals has not " hesitated in the past to interpret . . . the State Constitution independently of its Federal counterpart when necessary to assure that our State 's citizens are adequately protected from unreasonable governmental intrusions. " 82 <p> Underscoring just how profound are the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaye authored a separate concurring opinion " only to respond to the broader statements and implications of the dissent about State constitutional law , and especially about us. " 83 <p> Acknowledging that state constitutional cases have tended to " fracture " the court in recent years , 84 Kaye found the dissent " distinctive " solely in its " tone " and its " accusation " of ideological , unprincipled decision making. 85 Kaye lectured that , contrary to the dissent 's cramped view of state constitutional law , the Court of Appeals is " discharging its responsibility to support the State Constitution when it examines whether to follow along " with the Supreme Court 's decisional course as a matter of state law. 86 Noting that " the dissent is laced throughout with a sense of discomfort , even impropriety , about the exercise of State constitutional interpretation when it involves rejecting United States Supreme Court decisions , " 87 Judge Kaye explained the basics : 88 <p> A State court decision that rejects Supreme Court precedent , and opts for greater safeguard as a manner of State law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is a perfectly respectable and legitimate thing to do , and does not in any sense signal a return to the Articles of Confederation . Where we have gone beyond Supreme Court interpretations of Federal constitutional requirements , our objective has been the protection of fundamental rights , consistent with our Constitution , our precedents and own best human judgments in applying them. 89 <p> It is somewhat startling that the Court of Appeals , with such a long tradition of independent state-based decision making , should at this late date  --  and amidst the reemergence of state constitutional law nationwide  --  be struggling with such seemingly elementary questions . But as Judge Hancock put it in Scott , the " dissent brought into sharp focus divergent views concerning the place of State Courts in our Federal system and the circumstances under which they should act to protect fundamental rights of citizens left unprotected by the Federal Constitution . " 90 <p> There are also " divergent views " within the court as to the direction in which it should be proceeding on substantive issues under the state constitution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making necessarily extends rights and liberties . State constitutional law can be " conservative " as well as " liberal . " 91 In fact , a review of recent Court of Appeals case law demonstrates quite clearly that the New York tribunal has become increasingly pro-government and pro-prosecution in its application of the state constitution. 92 The last decision to be reviewed here , People v. Bing , is a good illustration. 93 It is also a good illustration of truly independent , well-reasoned , state constitutional argumentation engaged in by both sides of a sharply divided court . PEOPLE v. BING <p> In Bing the Court of Appeals significantly cut back on the state 's special right to counsel rules . New York has long provided expansive protection under the state constitution for the right to counsel in criminal proceedings. 94 One aspect of New York 's special protection has been the so-called " derivative " rule . As the court applied it in People v. Bartolomeo , 95 a suspect represented by an attorney on one charge could not , in the absence of that attorney , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge , regardless of whether the suspect wished to consult with counsel on that charge. 96 <p> A divided Court of Appeals in Bing expressly overruled Bortolomeo. 97 Speaking through Judge Simons , a four judge majority98 noted that the rule was adopted in unexplained conflict with recent precedent. 99 Moreover , because of the practical difficulties created by the rule , it was applied unevenly and was gradually diluted into a prohibition against little more than deliberate police misconduct. 100 According to the Bing majority , the rule simply made no sense . Persistent offenders were virtually immunized from questioning on any charge because they were already likely to be represented by counsel on some pending matter. 101 Moreover , this and other social costs wrought by the rule could not be justified " on some principled basis . " 102 As Simons explained : <p> Bartolomeo has no such basis . It rests on a fictional attorney-client relationship derived from a prior charge when in fact Bartolomeo defendants have waived their right to counsel and chosen not to hire a lawyer to represent them on the new unrelated charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit of legal advice and after at least one prior experience dealing with the authorities. 103 <p> The court had only recently established that the real purpose of the derivative rule was to protect the right to counsel on the charge for which counsel had been requested or retained. 104 That being so , why not , asked Simons , simply bar admission of statements that have a bearing on that charge ? Why should statements about an unrelated , unrepresented crime be shielded ? 105 Concluding that there was no justification for preserving such a costly and questionable rule , the majority decided that Bortolomeo must go . <p> In dissent , Judge Kaye disagreed that the derivative rule was so " aberrant. " 106 In her view  --  and that of Judges Alexander and Titone who joined her  --  it was the " product of the careful , considered , implementation of three guarantees of our State Constitution  --  due process , the privilege against self-incrimination , and the right to assistance of counsel . " 107 Bartolomeo , according to the dissenters , was part of a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fundamental fairness " in custodial questioning , where an attorney 's presence is especially needed to neutralize the coerciveness of the setting. 108 " Today , " Kaye lamented , " the court breaks with its proud tradition . " 109 <p> Whatever the merits of the respective opinions in Bing , the case is notable for several reasons . Its ruling is significant for criminal justice in New York , and it provides two examples of well-crafted , thoughtful , and candid judicial opinions. 110 Besides that , however , Bing is noteworthy because it reflects the current state constitutional direction of the Court of Appeals . For several years , the court has been retreating from prior rights-protective decisions . " 111 Independent state law , long employed by the court to expand the protection of individual liberties , is more often applied narrowly today to deny or limit claims of constitutional right . Not only the right to counsel , but a broad array of criminal and civil liberties have already been affected . " 112 Bing may thus represent a break with more than one " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent retrenchment is to be welcomed or condemned , the point is that state constitutionalism is not necessarily a liberal enterprise . <p> Bing is also noteworthy as a purely independent , statebased decision . Federal law was not argued in either the majority or dissenting opinion . Unlike Immuno II or Scott and Keta , federal law was wholly irrelevant to the issue before the Court of Appeals ; except for a passing reference , it was barely mentioned . New York 's right to counsel rules are based upon a long line of New York precedents that have reflected New York history and policies , and have developed New York standards . Hence , questions such as whether to apply federal law or depart from Supreme Court decisions would have been meaningless in Bing . IN SUMMARY <p> In Immuno II , Scott , and Keta , the New York Court of Appeals insisted on greater protection for individual liberty than that required by the federal minima . In each case , the court relied on New York 's constitution to chart an independent course . <p> But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court about the propriety and even legitimacy of articulating and applying state standards . The cases revealed deep divisions over whether the court should simply defer to Supreme Court judgments rendered under the federal constitution . One would have thought that the Court of Appeal 's long tradition of independent state-based decisions would have well settled such questions . <p> At the least , that tradition should , and usually does , serve to obviate slavish conformance or timorous confrontation with federal precedents . To be sure , New York 's tradition of adjudicative independence continues to beget more of the same . Indeed , whereas the conservative Bing decision might represent a break with past expansions of state-based rights , it was entirely true to the Court of Appeals 's history of independent decision making .
