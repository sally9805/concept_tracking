Northern Ireland is a land emotionally frozen in time . For Catholics and Protestants , the calendar reads 1 July 1690 , and the Battle of the Boyne is fought anew each day . As a local proverb asserts : " To hell with the future , and long live the past . May God in his mercy look down on Belfast . " Why is this conflict , whose origin dates back to the Norman invasion of Ireland in the twelfth century , still raging at the dawn of the twenty-first century ? The reason lies in the historic evolution of two separate national identities  --  Catholic and Protestant  --  and the present attempt by the former to politically abolish the latter . <p> To rescue Ireland from the religious decline brought on by the Viking invasions of the eighth to eleventh centuries , Pope Adrian IV issued a papal bull in 1154 entitled Laudabiliter , authorizing the Norman King of England , Henry II , to conquer Ireland . Adrian IV was an Englishman named Nicholas Breakspear . This fact is often cited by Irish nationalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an English conspiracy between the pontiff and the monarch . <p> For such a conspiracy to have occurred requires the existence in the twelfth century of English nationalism , a phenomenon that did not emerge until the late sixteenth century . If for argument 's sake it is assumed that this nationalism did exist , then an " English " conspiracy theory is even less ' tenable . The king of England was French . The pope who sanctified the actual conquest , Alexander III , was Italian . <p> Despite the papal bull of 1154 , the Normans did not invade Ireland until 1169 . When the invasion occurred , it was at the invitation of the Irish king of Leinster , Dermont MacMurrough , who , after having been expelled from his domains by a rival , personally petitioned Henry II for an army by which to regain his throne . In return , the Irish king offered to recognize the king of England as his liege lord . <p> The invasion of Ireland by England in the twelfth century was a mirror image of the fifth century when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalists assert that the , Norman invasion of Ireland was an illegal act , this is not the view of the Catholic Church . The popes who succeeded Adrian IV recognized both the papal bull , Laudabiliter , and the occupation of Ireland by England as lawful acts . The Irish episcopate itself formally recognized the king of England as rightful lord of Ireland , dominus Hiberniae , in 1170 at Cashel and in 1177 at Dublin . <p> Because of the involvement of King Henry II in the political affairs of France , the conquest of Ireland was undertaken by Norman warlords , not the Norman state . The conquest , therefore , lacked the unity to impose a centralized political administration on Ireland . A number of independent Norman baronies were established instead , whose harsh regimes provoked the Irish to armed insurrections . Some Irish nationalists see in these revolts a " national " reaction against foreign rule . Such was not the case . The Irish offered the " crown " of Ireland to other foreign leaders  --  to King Hakon of Norway in 1263 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Throughout the Irish wars of the thirteenth , fourteenth , and fifteenth centuries , England 's presence in Ireland was successfully defended by those Norman warlords . Even at the zenith of their power , however , the Normans never controlled all of Ireland . By the fifteenth century , England 's authority had been reduced to the city of Dublin and its immediate environs . <p> The religious break with Rome in 1534 impelled England to reassert its power in Ireland . Any portion of Ireland that remained independent was a potential military base from which Catholic Spain or Catholic France could launch attacks on Protestant England . <p> In 1542 , Pope Paul III dispatched a Jesuit commission to Ireland to preach loyalty to the faith and rebellion against the Protestant government . <p> In 1579 , and again in 1580 , Pope Gregory XIII financed a joint Papal State-Spanish invasion of Ireland . The pontiff proclaimed the invasion to be a religious crusade against Protestantism in England . <p> In 1588 , after failing to conquer England , remnants of the Spanish Armada sought safety in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic uprising in Ireland against English rule . This assistance culminated in the Spanish invasion of Ireland between 1601 and 1603 . <p> Between 1641-1653 , the Catholic Church played a leading role in the armed insurrection by Catholics against Protestants in Ulster , and in an Irish Catholic military alliance with King Charles I against Parliament during England 's Civil War . <p> In 1689 , 1690 , and 1691 , the French invaded Ireland to support the claims of the Catholic James II to the throne of England . <p> In 1760 , France again attempted an invasion of Ireland . <p> To Protestants , these wars and invasions jus-titled the subjugation of Ireland , the outlawing of Catholicism , and the expulsion of Catholic priests. 2 <p> A three-tier hierarchy was established in Ireland . On the bottom , politically oppressed , religiously persecuted , and economically exploited , was the Catholic majority population. 3 Next came the Presbyterians . They were barred from holding political office ; were tenants , not landlords ; were taxed for the benefit of the Anglican Church ; their schools were closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of this colonial system were the English Protestants . Yet , it was from among this privileged community that the leaders of a national movement emerged . This movement split , however , into two factions that can be loosely termed constitutionalists and revolutionists . <p> The constitutionalists , under the leadership of Henry Grattan , won from London a series of legislative reforms between 1779 and 1793 . These victories included free trade , habeus corpus , a Parliament of Ireland not bound by the acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom , the supremacy throughout Ireland of laws enacted by the Parliament of Ireland , the stipulation that all legal cases in Ireland were to be decided exclusively by the courts of Ireland , reservation of the power of taxation and expenditure in Ireland to the Parliament of Ireland , recognition of the independent treaty-making powers of the Parliament of Ireland , recognition that Ireland and the United Kingdom were bound only by a common monarch , relaxation of the laws against Catholics and Presbyterians , legislation guaranteeing Catholics the right to purchase and inherit land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the right to vote . <p> For the revolutionists , the United Irishmen led by Theobald Wolfe Tone , these achievements were unacceptable . They desired a termination of all political links with Great Britain and the establishment of a republic . To achieve those ends , they turned to Revolutionary France . Supported by French troops , Wolfe Tone attempted to invade Ireland once in 1796 and twice in 1798 , but was defeated . Without French military aid , the Irish insurrection of 1798 collapsed . The revolt ultimately failed , however , because it assumed the nature of a religious war with Catholics killing Protestants. 4 <p> Convinced by the insurrection that the existing political relationship with Ireland posed a threat to the security of the United Kingdom , London passed the 1800 Act of Union. 5 In a single stroke , all the powers gained for Ireland by Henry Grattan and the constitutionalists , and the Parliament of Ireland itself , which had existed since 1297 , were abolished . <p> Only with the end of the Napoleonic Wars did the Catholic Church become interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for achieving three specific goals : the right of Catholics to vote and hold office , the disestablishment of the Protestant Church of Ireland , and the creation of a Catholic education system . When this nationalism defined Irish identity in terms of nationality , not Catholicism , however , it was attacked . <p> The Repeal movement of the 1830s and the 1840s , which sought to repeal the Act of Union , was opposed by Pope Gregory XVI . <p> The Young Ireland movement , which was created in 1842 and sought Irish independence , was officially condemned by the Catholic hierarchy of Ireland in 1845 , and by Pope Pius IX on 5 August 1848. 6 <p> Fenianism , which arose in 1858 advocating independence for Ireland , was condemned on 4 August 1863 by the Catholic hierarchy of Ireland , and in January 1870 by Pope Pius IX. 7 <p> The movement for Irish Home Rule , which sought to re-establish the Parliament of Ireland , was opposed by the Catholic hierarchy of Ireland and Pope Leo XIII throughout the 1870s and the 1880s . They objected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Protestant , and his vision of a future Ireland was not founded upon Catholicism . <p> Parnell was the last leader of an Irish constitutionalist party that advocated nationalist goals and encompassed both Catholics and Protestants . His death in 1891 , at the age of 45 , signaled the demise of Irish nationalism . After 1900 , " Home Rule " rapidly evolved into an essentially Catholic political movement that was to culminate in 1921 in the establishment of the avowedly Catholic Irish Free State . The rise of this Catholic nationalism accelerated a growing realization among the Protestants of Ulster that they are a separate nation , not just a different religion , from the Catholic , Gaelic south . Ulster Protestants possess a distinct British history , a distinct British culture , and a common territory . <p> By 1905 , the Protestants of Ulster had created a unified movement dedicated to preserving their union with the United Kingdom . While the personal ambition , religious intolerance , and economic anxiety of individuals played a role in the formation of unionism , only the collective belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and strength . Only this conviction in a separate nationhood explains why the Protestants of Ulster transferred their political allegiance from Wolfe Tone and independence in 1798 to Edward Carson and unionism in 1912 ; and why they would profess loyalty to the Parliament of the United Kingdom , but still commit treason by threatening armed force to prevent any Home Rule act for Ireland being applied to Ulster . This evolution in Ulster Protestant national identity is not historically unique . in the nineteenth century , many Catholic Croatians considered that they and Orthodox Serbians belonged to a single " Yugoslav " nation . By the twentieth century , Croatians had realized that they are , in fact , a completely separate nation . <p> The war of 1919-1921 between Irish nationalists and the United Kingdom ended with the Anglo-Irish Peace Treaty of 1921 , and the partition of Ireland . This treaty was similar to the terms originally set forth in the Government of Ireland Act of 1920 , terms previously rejected by the Irish nationalists . The Irish Free State , established in principle for the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Empire , but with Northern Ireland , consisting of six of the nine counties of Ulster , guaranteed its own separate parliament and the legal right to secede . In 1922 , the state of Northern Ireland , exercising that right , withdrew from the Irish Free State and rejoined the United Kingdom . <p> A faction of the Irish Republican Army , however , would not accept partition , and an Irish civil war raged from July 1922 to April 1923 . To preserve the treaty , the Irish Free State exceeded in scope and violence the acts of the British during the Anglo-Irish War . In Dublin , three times as many political prisoners were jailed , and three times as many nationalists were executed. 8 Among those executed was Erskine Childers . Because he opposed partition , Childers was derided as an " Englishman " by Arthur Griffith , future president of the Irish Dail. 9 When justifying the execution , Minister for Home Affairs Kevin O'Higgins alluded to the fact that Erskine Childers was an " Englishman . " <p> Because his father was English and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Childers was not a " true " Irishman . Patrick Pearse , however , had an English father and an Irish mother. 10 And Eamon de Valera was born in New York City of a Spanish father and Irish mother. 11 Yet no one denied their Irish identity . But Pearse and de Valera were Catholics , while Childers was a Protestant . Religion , not paternity , was the criterion by which official nationalism determined whether an individual was Irish. 12 The execution of Erskine Childers was the symbolic execution of the idea that Protestants could be Irish . <p> The society created in the Irish Free State institutionalized this belief . Catholic moral law was made state law. 13 Divorce was outlawed ; even foreign divorces were not legally recognized. 14 Importing or selling contraceptive devices was prohibited by law. 15 Books and films were censored. 16 Blasphemy was made a crime. 17 Education reflected Catholic morality. 18 In add n , schools and civic associations were segregated by religion . And children of Catholic-Protestant marriages were required to be raised Catholic. 19 <p> By 1937 , the ties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the United Kingdom , by the Anglo-Irish Peace Treaty of 1921  --  the oath of allegiance to the British Crown , and office of governor-general  --  were abolished . Even the English language was attacked . Irish , a language few Catholics could speak , was made the national and first official language of state 20 British influences were discarded as an official Celtic identity was promoted in names , dances , songs , sports , and the arts . Finally , in 1949 , a republic was proclaimed and Ireland withdrew from the Commonwealth . <p> That such official discrimination did not degenerate into persecution is due to the fact that the Protestant minority never posed a demographic threat to the republic . " hey represent only 5 percent of the population , and their numbers are declining . In 1920 , there were 221,000 Protestants residing in southern Ireland . By 1981 , there were only 126,254 Protestants . 21 <p> Yet Catholics have not benefited from this avowedly Catholic republic . They suffer from the same social ills as the British  --  teenage pregnancies , illegitimate births @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess fewer political freedoms than the British . Impelled by one of the lowest per capita incomes and one of the highest unemployment rates in Western Europe , hundreds of thousands have emigrated to the United Kingdom. 22 <p> For the Protestants of Northern Ireland , both the 1922-1923 civil war among the Irish nationalists and the type of government and society that emerged in the south reinforced their opposition to unification . To preserve separation , the north created a sectarian identity that mirrored the south . Northern Ireland was to be a " Protestant nation for a Protestant people . " Although Dublin had officially recognized the existence and legitimacy of Northern Ireland in the 1921 Anglo-Irish Peace Treaty and in the 1925 Anglo-Irish Boundary Treaty ? with the adoption of the 1937 constitution the Catholic south now proclaimed its sovereignty over the Protestant north. 24 For Protestants , this act was more than a violation of the treaties , it was " proof " that the Catholics were out to destroy their state . <p> The Protestants of Northern Ireland feel threatened from within as well as from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Northern Ireland and have a higher birth rate , they pose a demographic threat . Many Protestants fear Catholics will one day become the majority population and vote the state of Northern Ireland out of existence . This fear shaped the political system . <p> To prevent any significant acquisition of political power by Catholics there was extensive gerrymandering of electoral boundaries , discriminatory property requirements for voting , and plural votes for business properties , virtually all of which were owned by Protestants . To ensure that Catholics did not acquire significant economic power , Protestant-con-trolled local governments and Protestant businesses saw to it that jobs and housing went principally to coreligionists . Catholics were thus made to bear a disproportionate share of unemployment and poverty . <p> Through the powers conferred upon them by the Special Powers Act and similar legislation , the Protestant dominated Royal Ulster Constabulary , aided by the para-military " B " Specials , harassed many Catholics . These powers included search and seizure without warrant , and the suspension of habeas corpus , death inquests , and freedom of the press . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association began demanding the full and free exercise of those democratic rights to which , as British citizens , they were legally entitled . By 1969 , their specific demands had been met . The " B " Specials had been disbanded , and reforms of electoral , housing , and employment practices had been instituted . <p> When some Catholics declared such reforms meaningless and initiated violence , many Protestants saw this as another Catholic attempt to destroy the state of Northern Ireland similar to those launched by the IRA during World War II and between 1956 and 1962 . The Protestants retaliated , and the situation quickly escalated into open warfare between the two communities . <p> In August 1969 , the British government intervened . Catholics , who were the clear loser in this sectarian war , welcomed the arrival of British troops . When in March 1972 London declared its intent to assume control over local security , the government of Northern Ireland resigned in protest . London thereupon imposed direct rule and took steps to eliminate religious and sex discrimination in the workplace , promote employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the civil administration . <p> Restructuring the state , however , has not solved " the Irish problem . " For twenty years , all attempts at a political solution for Northern Ireland have failed. 25 They failed because they ignored the fundamental reality . Protestant Northern Ireland is a separate nation from the Catholic Republic of Ireland  --  as Canada is from the United States. 26 <p> Irish nationalists reject this reality and hence the legitimacy of partition . Ireland is an island and therefore , they argue , should constitute a single state like Iceland , Australia , or Jamaica. 27 But this is not an absolute law of geography . Some islands have not achieved a separate independence but have been united with other islands to form a single country , such as Indonesia , Japan , New Zealand , and the Philippines . In other cases , single islands have been partitioned into two or more states . Hispaniola is divided between two Catholic , black/mulatto states  --  Spanish-speaking Dominican Republic and Creole-speaking Haiti  --  while Borneo , the third largest island in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Indonesia , and Malaysia . <p> The history of Sri Lanka and Cyprus should be carefully studied by Irish nationalists . Both islands achieved political independence from British colonialism as undivided states . This unity was based upon national self-determination as defined by the majority nations  --  the Buddhist Sinhalese in Sri Lanka and the Christian Greeks in Cyprus. 28 It was a unification rejected by the Hindu Tamil minority in Sri Lanka and the Muslim Turkish minority in Cyprus . The consequence has been almost continuous violence between the majority and minority nations on both islands and the de facto partition of Sri Lanka and Cyprus . <p> Irish nationalists should realize that the Tamil minority in Sri Lanka and the Turkish minority in Cyprus each represent only 18 percent of the population on their respective islands . If Northern Ireland is united to the Republic of Ireland , then the Protestant minority in this enlarged state would represent nearly 25 percent of the total population . To liberate themselves from such a union , the Protestants of Northern Ireland will fight as resolutely as any Tamil or Turk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ireland is wrong because partition in principle is wrong . Yet Dublin recognized the legitimacy of the 1947 partition of British India into Pakistan and India 29 and the 1948 partition of Palestine into a Jewish state and an Arab state . The Irish Republican Army similarly undermines its credibility . If it supports the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza , it is recognizing the legitimacy of partitioning Palestine into two states . IRA opposition to the partition of Ireland into two states thereby becomes logically inconsistent . <p> If the IRA supports a Palestinian state that includes all of pre-1948 Palestine , that is , all of Israel as well as the West Bank and Gaza , its position becomes untenable . Palestinians in such a state would constitute a minority population ruling an Israeli majority . And the only Jewish state amid the Muslim countries of the Middle East would be extinguished . By that logic , the Protestants of Northern Ireland can legitimately annex the Republic of Ireland . That Protestant minority can rule that Catholic majority . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isles can have its political independence similarly extinguished . <p> The unification of East and West Germany in 1990 is advanced by Irish nationalists as a precedent for the unification of Ireland . It is not . As the 17 June 1953 uprising in East Germany demonstrated , that country was created against the wishes of the local population . In contrast , Protestants in Northern Ireland had demanded a separate state for themselves and had nearly fought a civil war in 1914 to obtain it . Not only are the conditions of Ireland and Germany dissimilar , but the example of Germany works against the cause of Irish nationalists . First , the reunification of East and West Germany did not result in German unification , since Austria is still a separate country . Second , the citizens of Austria have not shown a significant desire to unite with Germany . Third , the German nation , therefore , remains " partitioned " between a Catholic Austria and a predominately Protestant Germany . Fourth , the Republic of Ireland endorses this " partition " by recognizing the independence of Austria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have occurred in Eastern Europe since 1989 . The democratic revolutions in Czechoslovakia , the Soviet Union , and Yugoslavia evolved into independence for the minority nations . These twenty-two new countries , therefore , provide added legitimacy for the independence of Northern Ireland from the Republic of Ireland . <p> Four political options exist for Northern Ireland : ( 1 ) full integration into the United Kingdom ; ( 2 ) unification with the Republic of Ireland ; ( 3 ) independence ; or ( 4 ) partition between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom . <p> Option 1 : Many , if not most , Catholics in Northern Ireland reject the United Kingdom and deny the legitimacy of the state of Northern Ireland . They believe that demography , which is in their favor , will force London to acquiesce in unification with the Republic of Ireland . The Protestants of Northern Ireland fear this same eventuality . Catholic hopes and Protestant fears were confirmed by the official policy of the United Kingdom to support unification whenever a majority of the population of Northern Ireland votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state to be transitory . This prevented the establishment of any stable and rational political life . <p> To correct this problem , Northern Ireland should be fully integrated into the United Kingdom through the means of political unification with Scotland . This would guarantee Catholics of Northern Ireland the full and free exercise of their rights as British citizens , which had been the original demand of the civil rights movement and which logically they can realize only within the United Kingdom . Integration would also assure them that the previous political system could not return . <p> By becoming part of Scotland , a Protestant country with a population of 4,999,000 according to the 1991 Census , the Protestants of Northern Ireland would now have demography on their side . They would never again have to fear Catholics someday forming the majority population and voting to abolish the state of Northern Ireland . Any referendum on the unification of Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland would be determined by all the voters of Scotland . And their answer would , most assuredly , be " no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded nor desired Home Rule for themselves but only wished to remain within the United Kingdom , becoming a part of Scotland , a country with which they have many historic ties , should be an acceptable means to them for insuring that goal . 31 <p> Option 2 : Unification with the Republic of Ireland in either a unitary state or a federal system will be rejected as long as the Protestants are the majority population in Northern Ireland . A unitary state is unacceptable because it would offer the Protestants no effective legal protection from democratically sanctioned oppression by the Catholic majority . A federal system , whereby Northern Ireland retains its own parliament and local autonomy , is advanced as the political remedy . But it is n't . Once Catholics , whether as the result of a higher birth rate or immigration from the south , form the majority population in the north they can democratically vote to either abolish the federal system or use the northern parliament to enact discriminatory legislation against the culture , the heritage , and the identity of Protestants . A precedent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dublin government since 1937 . <p> Confronted with this Protestant majority , some Irish nationalists have asserted that the Protestants of Northern Ireland are colonists and should be expelled to Great Britain . While London would never agree to such a plan , any effort by Irish nationalists to advance this proposal would provoke many Protestants in Northern Ireland and their supporters elsewhere in the United Kingdom to demand that the political status of Northern Ireland be resolved by expelling the Catholic minority to the Republic of Ireland . Although London would not agree to that plan either , militant Protestants might seek to achieve this goal by unleashing an unprecedented campaign of terrorism to drive Catholics from Northern Ireland . A precedent is the Serbian campaign in Bosnia-Herzegovina . <p> Only if Catholics , as a result of their higher birth rate , become the majority population in Northern Ireland is unification with the Republic of Ireland likely to occur . But with unification , the Dublin government will inherit " the troubles . " To achieve reunification with the United Kingdom or independence , Protestant paramilitary groups will adopt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , military , and political representatives of the republic . Should Dublin attempt to end the violence by physically expelling the Protestant population in the north from Ireland , London could retaliate with devastating effect by " repatriating " to the Republic of Ireland the hundreds of thousands of Irish currently living in Great Britain. 32 Ireland could not endure the resulting financial and social strain . <p> The Republic of Ireland does not possess the military and economic resources either to contain or to endure the violence. 33 The north would move inevitably toward armed anarchy as militant Protestants seek to carve out a state for themselves . While not necessarily attempting to re-establish the old borders , these Protestants would endeavor to seize and hold as much territory as possible by expelling Catholic inhabitants . Again the precedent is Serbian action in Bosnia-Herzegovina . <p> Opposing this new partition would be the government of the Republic of Ireland and the outlawed Irish Republican Army . Neither nationalist force , however , has the military ability to defeat the Protestants . And it is highly improbable that the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , " would militarily intervene to preserve Irish unification . A Protestant victory in the north would exacerbate the historic animosity between the Dublin government and the IRA , possibly igniting a civil war between their forces in the south . <p> Option 3 : While still constituting the majority population , the Protestants of Northern Ireland , feeling alienated from the United Kingdom and fearing an eventual abandonment by London , may decide to declare Northern Ireland an independent country. 34 In terms of territory and population , an independent Northern Ireland would be larger than Cyprus or Luxembourg . With seventy years of experience at self-government , the Protestants possess the administrative personnel as well as the political , economic , and military infrastructure necessary for independence . All that has been missing was the political will . <p> Since 1922 , the United Kingdom has officially upheld the democratic right of the population of Northern Ireland to determine their own political future . While in the past this has meant the freedom to vote to either unite with the Republic of Ireland or remain a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any validity it must also include the right to choose independence . Having already recognized the independence of the successor states to Czechoslovakia , the Soviet Union , and Yugoslavia , neither London nor the international community would be able to convincingly argue against Northern Ireland 's exercising that same right . <p> While many Catholics would likely leave Northern Ireland as soon as it became an independent state , Protestants would undoubtedly attempt to ensure the stability and integrity of their country by encouraging a mass exodus . <p> Precedents exist . They range from the flight of " Loyalists " following the American Revolution and French settlers after Algerian independence to the mass expulsions of Germans from countries in Central and Eastern Europe after World War II . <p> Option 4 : A suggestion often made is that Northern Ireland be partitioned . The three counties having a Catholic majority  --  London-derry , Fermanagh , and Tyrone  --  would be annexed to the Republic of Ireland , while the counties of Antrim , Down , and Armagh , with their Protestant majorities , would remain part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that the Northern Ireland that emerges from any partition would be economically unviable and financially too expensive for London to maintain . The counties of Antrim , Down , and Armagh would be compelled to accept unification with the Republic of Ireland . How a truncated state of Northern Ireland can be a devastating financial burden for the United Kingdom but not for the much poorer Republic of Ireland is not explained . <p> If the Protestants of Northern Ireland agreed to such a partition  --  and their acceptance would be essential  --  it certainly would be on the condition that an exchange of populations is simultaneously effected . The Protestants living in the counties awarded to the Republic of Ireland would move to the state of Northern Ireland , while Catholics living in the counties remaining a part of Northern Ireland would move to the republic . Precedents for mutual exchanges of populations were created by Greece and Turkey in 1923 , and by Pakistan and India in 1947 . <p> Contrary to the expectation of some Irish nationalists , a smaller Northern Ireland would most likely be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax incentives from London to foreign companies operating there would attract investments . Because it achieved a negotiated settlement , the new Northern Ireland could also expect foreign aid from the United States , Europe , and the World Bank . <p> If a permanent political settlement for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is to be achieved , four steps must be taken . First , the nature of the problem has to be officially recognized . Two separate nations exist ; one is Catholic ( the Republic of Ireland ) , and the other is Protestant ( Northern Ireland ) . Each possesses the right to national self-determination . Second , the failed proposal of the past , unification of Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland , and the failed policy of the present , continuing the status quo in Northern Ireland , have to be discarded . Third , the political options and consequences for Northern Ireland of full integration into the United Kingdom , independence , or partition must be publicly debated . Full integration is the most just . It alone preserves the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can be instituted quickly with minimal financial or emotional cost . Fourth , one of these options must be selected as the basis for official negotiations . Not to seriously consider these political options will only ensure that both Ire-lands preserve their pasts , while forfeiting their futures . <p>
