Montana novelist Ivan Doig sets himself a challenge in his big , roistering new novel , Bucking the Sun ( Simon &; Schuster ; 412 pages ; $23 ) . His subject  --  not just the book 's setting but also the presence that rules its composition  --  is a monstrous , chancy construction project in the mid-1930s , the huge Fort Peck dam across the Missouri River in Montana bottomland . <P> To save his novel from the curse of what used to be called socialist realism , Doig must come up with characters large enough to symbolize the unruly river and the vast dam in combat as construction proceeds , but sufficiently strong and gritty in their own right so that they ca n't be yawned away as costumed actors posing in front of a diorama . <P> He finds effective protagonists in the Duff clan , Scottish immigrants and hardscrabble farmers losing their battle with drought and grasshoppers in the river valley until the dam project lurches into motion . Owen , the bookish eldest son , is an engineer . His twin brothers Neil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , work in the river 's murk . Father Hugh is a reluctant laborer and enthusiastic boozer , and Uncle Darius , a union organizer on the run . The younger men marry and risk lives and livers as they watch the river slowly pool up behind the growing dam . <P> The reader is pulled into their story by a puzzle the author has set : What two Duffs  --  man and woman , naked , married but not to each other  --  are extracted drowned from a submerged truck as the construction winds down ? This is skillful manipulation , the novelist as conjurer ensuring that the reader 's first thought is of human beings , not power shovels and spillways . The device works beautifully , and so does Doig 's roguish novel . Though not well enough  --  perhaps never that well , if your characters wear jeans  --  for its author to escape the tag " regional . " <P>  --  By John Skow
