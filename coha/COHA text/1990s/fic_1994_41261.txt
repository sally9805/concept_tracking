Earthworm Tractor Company Earthworm City , Illinois Office of the President <p> Friday , January 3 , 1958 Mr. Alexander Botts , Sales Manager , Earthworm Tractor Co . <p> Care Henry Harper , Earthworm Tractor Dealer Rock City , Texas <p> Dear Botts : I have recently written and sent out to our dealers a new pamphlet , " The Customer is Always Right . " The principles set forth in this little work should be especially useful to our dealers and their salesmen , many of whom seem inclined to quarrel rather than cooperate with customers . I trust you will say a good word for this pamphlet to all members of our selling organization with whom you may come in contact . Most sincerely , Gilbert Henderson , President <p> Rock City , Texas Monday , January 6 , 1958 <p> Dear Henderson : I have your letter  --  and I am sorry to report that your philosophy about the customer being always right is not going so good around here . I arrived in town early this afternoon in the company car . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hank Harper , our local dealer , and found him sitting at his desk glaring at a copy of your pamphlet . <p> " This is the last straw , " he said . " At a time like this , when everything is going wrong , the president of your company sends me one of the most idiotic pamphlets I have ever read . " <p> " What seems to be the trouble ? " I asked . <p> " Everything , " he said . " Most of my salesmen are down with the flu . Most of my office force is down with the flu . Most of my mechanics are down with the flu . I seem to be getting it myself . My temperature is over 100 . And two of my best customers are acting completely unreasonable . One of them is due to arrive in here any minute now . He 'll start yelling at me , and I do n't think I have the strength to handle him . " <p> " Hank , " I said , " you can stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , and take care of yourself . Fortunately for you , Alexander Botts is on the scene . I will take charge of the situation with every confidence that I can work out a solution to your difficulties . " <p> The door of the office opened , and a large , tough-looking gentleman came in . <p> " Good afternoon , Mr. McDonald , " said Hank . <p> The man scowled and began sounding off . " I have decided my wildcat well is a failure . I am going to move my drilling equipment out of the canyon . I want one of your big XX9 Earthworm tractors to do the job , and I want it right away . I 'm in a hurry . " He pounded on the desk . <p> Hank replied in a weak and discouraged voice , " I just told you over the telephone a few minutes ago that I do n't have any of those big tractors on hand . " <p> " You also said you would try to borrow the machine that belongs to old man Pike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him right after I talked to you , Mr. McDonald . He wo n't let you have it , and you know why . " <p> " Sure . Old man Pike is a crook . I 've been exposing him , and naturally he does n't like it . " <p> " If you would just lay off of him for a few days , " said Hank , " maybe I could persuade him to let you take his machine . " <p> " I 'll never lay off . " " Then I 'll just have to order a new Earthworm shipped in , but I do n't know when it will arrive . " <p> " You make me sick , " said Mr. McDonald . " For months you 've been after me to buy Earthworm tractors . Now that I want one , you ca n't deliver it . Fortunately , the Goliath tractor dealer has told me he can deliver one of his machines in two or three days . So I 'll just have to do business with him . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am Alexander Botts , sales manager of the Earthworm Tractor Company . If you will sit down and let us discuss your problems , I am sure that I can help you . " <p> Reluctantly Mr. McDonald took a chair . I did likewise . <p> Hank gave me a brief explanation . " Rock City , " he said , " is located on the rim of Rock Canyon , which is several hundred feet deep . About five miles upstream from here is the Rock River power dam , holding back the waters of Rock Lake . Just below the dam , there is a break in the canyon wall , with a road which leads down to the canyon floor at a point where Mr. McDonald has been drilling a wildcat oil well . Incidentally , I should explain that Mr. McDonald is one of our leading businessmen and a promoter of many large enterprises . " <p> " I 'm in a hurry , " said Mr. McDonald . " Do I have to listen to all this stuff ? " <p> " My only desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . As sales manager of the Earthworm Company I may be able to provide you with a tractor sooner than you think . You say you are in a hurry to move your oil-drilling equipment out of the canyon ? " <p> " Yes , Mr. Botts . A few days ago we had a mild earthquake . It did no damage here in town , but it has so seriously weakened the foundations of the Rock River dam that it may go out at any time . " <p> " And this would let the water from the lake wash away your drilling equipment ? " <p> " Not only the drilling equipment , but a lot of supplies and machinery , including two 30-ton Goliath tractors . " <p> " Why do n't you use the Goliath tractors to move your stuff ? " <p> " They have both broken down , and it will take a couple of weeks to get the parts to repair them . And I do n't have any other large tractors available in this neighborhood . " <p> " Mr. McDonald , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am here . I am going to help you in two ways . In the first place , I am going to work on the problem of getting your valuable machinery out of the way of this potential flood . In the second place , I am going to prevail upon you , for your own good , to shift your patronage from the almost worthless Goliath to the peerless Earthworm . " <p> " Mere words , " said Mr. McDonald , " do not impress me . What I want is action . If you get that hardware out of the canyon before the dam lets go , I 'll buy nothing but Earthworm machinery from now on . If the Goliath man gets there first and does the job , I 'll keep on buying from him . And I 'm planning to place some big orders before long for an Oklahoma highway-construction job that I have just bid in . If you want to get in touch with me , I 'll be in my office across the street . Good-bye . " <p> As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiously and said , " Do you really think you can get a new XX9 Earthworm in here within a couple of days ? " <p> " I 'm afraid not , " I said . " This model has been so popular that we 're way behind on our deliveries . I doubt if there is a single machine anywhere in Texas or the whole Southwest that has not been already promised . So the only thing to do is go after the tractor that is already here in town . I think you said it belonged to somebody called Pike ? " <p> " I just told you he wo n't let us have it . " <p> " We can always try . Is Mr. Pike really a crook ? " <p> " Not really . You see , he owns a cave with a waterfall in it . The entrance to the cave is at the bottom of the canyon at the edge of Rock City , here . The only way to reach it is to drive five miles upstream along the state highway , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has his drill rig , and finally another five miles along a rather poor gravel road in the bottom of the canyon . " <p> " Which brings you to the cave entrance in the canyon wall just below the edge of Rock City ? " <p> " Correct . Mr. Pike has started to advertise his cave as a tourist attraction . He has signs all over this region : Visit Pike 's Cave  --  See the Great Underground Waterfall . He charges 50c admission , but he does n't make much money because people do n't like that rough five-mile drive along the gravel road on the floor of the canyon . " <p> " Could n't he install an elevator to take his customers straight down into the canyon ? " <p> " It was going to cost too much . So Mr. Pike petitioned the commissioners ' court to have the county improve the road in the canyon with a blacktop surface . And he started a big campaign with advertisements in the local paper , claiming that his project would benefit the whole town by bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Mr. McDonald did not like this ? " <p> " No . He began putting advertisements of his own in the paper , charging that improving the road would bring more business to Mr. Pike , but to nobody else . He said it was just a crooked scheme to rob the taxpayers for the benefit of Mr. Pike . " <p> " And I suppose Mr. Pike came back with more advertisements of his own ? " <p> " Yes . And last week Mr. McDonald stopped publishing advertisements and rented some sound equipment from a local radio store . He recorded a lot of speeches on tape , with interludes of band music . He put the sound equipment on a truck , which has been driving all over town blaring forth Mr. McDonald 's opinions , and announcing that he will run for county commissioner for this precinct in the next election on a platform of ' Millions for the people of Rock City , but not one cent for Pike 's Private Promenade . ' " <p> Hank led me over and opened one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the sound truck . <p> " Is n't he starting his campaign pretty far ahead of the election ? " I asked . <p> " When a man like that goes into politics , Mr. Botts , he works at it 12 months out of the year . " <p> " Hank , " I said , " I thank you for giving me such a clear account of the situation . I now repeat my suggestion that you go home and climb into bed . While you are taking care of yourself , I will call Mr. Pike and try to make him understand that he is completely wrong in refusing to lend his tractor . " <p> Hank explained how I could reach Mr. Pike 's home and wished me luck . " I do n't know if you can get anywhere with Mr. Pike , " he said , " but at least you are not as crazy as this thing . " He picked up from the desk his copy of your pamphlet , " The Customer Is Always Right . " " It does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers  --  both of them stubborn , opinionated and quarrelsome . I say they are both wrong . " <p> " And I agree with you . " <p> " Then why does Mr. Henderson say the customer is always right ? " <p> Note . At this point , Henderson , I decided that the title of your pamphlet really is a bit silly . But I am happy to report that I sprang to your defense at once . <p> " What Mr. Henderson was probably trying to say is that a good salesman can often gain the good will of a customer and thus promote a sale by making the customer think the salesman thinks the customer is right , even though the salesman knows the customer is wrong . " <p> " If that is what he meant , why did n't he say so ? And what does he mean on page one , here , where he urges us dealers to become ' emotionally mature ' and cultivate a feeling of ' empathy ' and ' togetherness ' with our customers ? I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in inspirational drivel like that . " <p> " You are perfectly right , " I said . " But we should not blame Mr. Henderson . I do n't think he wrote this foolish pamphlet . Probably he never even read it . " <p> " I do n't understand . " <p> " It 's very simple . Mr. Henderson is far too busy with the important problems of the business to waste his time on a mere pamphlet . So he turns the job over to some bright young college graduate who has a good flow of language and knows a lot of important-sounding words . The young man writes the pamphlet . The president signs it . " <p> " I never heard of such a thing . " <p> " It 's done all the time . When you read a foolish statement by some big shot in business , do n't blame him . Blame his ghost writer . And if you think some decision by the United States Supreme Court is foolish , do n't blame the justices . They ca n't possibly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decisions in all the cases that come before them . So most of the work has to be done by bright but inexperienced young law clerks just out of law school . " <p> Having thus defended your reputation , Henderson , by comparing your behavior with that of the august United States Supreme Court , I got Hank started for home . I myself drove to Mr. Pike 's residence . at which turned out to be a comfortable house set in a spacious and well-kept lawn . Mr. Pike , an elderly gentleman with a thin , suspicious-looking face , greeted me politely . <p> After introducing myself , I steered the conversation away from controversial matters by launching into a veritable rhapsody on the subject of caves . I explained that I was a lifelong lover of caves in general , and of underground waterfalls in particular . This started him off on a description of his own spectacular cave and waterfall . I then told him of my visit to the waterfall in the great Secret Caverns in New York State . Before long , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I listened spellbound while he told me of his thrilling adventures in exploring his own cave . <p> He then took me out onto a terrace at the rear of the house , and we peered over a stone retaining wall into a deep and awe-inspiring chasm . " This is Rock Canyon , " said Mr. Pike . " At this point , it is deeper than the Washington Monument is high  --  almost 600 feet . It is about a hundred feet wide and , as you can see , the walls are practically vertical limestone . The entrance to the cave is directly beneath us , under a slight overhang which makes it impossible for us to see it from here . " <p> While Mr. Pike was speaking , I had noticed the steady roar of an Earthworm motor coming from the depths of the canyon . <p> " You have a tractor working down there ? " I asked . <p> " Yes , " he said . " I have an XX9 Earthworm with a bulldozer blade smoothing up a section of the canyon floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I expect to visit my cave . This parking lot is just around that first bend in the canyon , so you can not see it . " <p> " I have been told , " I said , " that you are advocating an improved blacktop road in the canyon . In my opinion , this would bring in a great many tourists  --  which would be a splendid thing for the businessmen of this entire region . However , I have also been told that this very desirable improvement is being opposed in a very unethical manner by a man called McDonald . Incidentally , I think I hear his sound truck right now . " <p> We both listened . From the direction of the downtown section of Rock City , we heard the distant strains of " Stars and Stripes Forever , " followed by Mr. McDonald 's recorded voice , bellowing his campaign oratory : " Shall we permit this grasping crook to use the taxpayers ' money for his own selfish advantage ? Are we going to permit this barefaced raid on the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Is it possible , " I said , " that he actually thinks he can get by with such underhanded methods ? " <p> " Unfortunately , " said Mr. Pike , " he has so much money and so much influence that he may succeed in blocking this whole road project . And I do n't know what to do about it . Hank Harper , your Earthworm dealer here , has weakly suggested that I might back down and try to make a deal with him . But I 'll never do that . " <p> " Good for you , " I said . " What you should do is force Mr. McDonald to back down . " <p> " How ? " <p> " I think I can help you , Mr. Pike . I have had a lot of experience with disreputable characters like Mr. McDonald . I know just how to handle them . If you will let me represent you , I will go to Mr. McDonald and say , ' Mr. Pike and I have you right where we want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of equipment down in the canyon just below a dam that is rapidly falling apart . The only way you can save your property is to haul it out of there with a big tractor . The only big tractor around here belongs to Mr. Pike  --  so he can make his own terms , and here they are . If you will shut down that sound truck right away and completely abandon your campaign against his road , he will lend you his tractor . ' " <p> " But that 's almost the same deal that Hank Harper was talking about . " <p> " It 's entirely different , " I said . " Hank was bargaining from weakness . He wanted you , first of all , to lend your tractor to Mr. McDonald . Then , after he had saved his machinery and you no longer had any power over him , you would make a feeble attempt to appeal to his gratitude , hoping he might give up his campaign against the road . I am going to make the man shut down his sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only then do we lend him the tractor . " <p> " The way you tell it , Mr. Botts , it sounds pretty good . " <p> " Incidentally , I said , " if that dam goes out , it would wash away your tractor as well as Mr. McDonald 's machinery . So I would advise that you get your machine and your operator out of the canyon right away . " <p> " I 'm not worried , Mr. Botts . I do n't think that dam will wash out , so I 'll risk the tractor . " <p> " And the operator ? " <p> " He could escape into the cave . " <p> " Maybe so , " I said . " But in the meantime , do I have your permission to force Mr. McDonald to accept your terms ? " <p> " Certainly , Mr. Botts . " <p> I drove down to Mr. McDonald 's office . " Sir , " I said , " I bring you good news . Mr. Pike has agreed to lend you his tractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All you have to do is shut down your sound truck and give up your campaign against his road improvements . " <p> " Not a chance , " said Mr. McDonald . " I 'll wait for that Goliath machine . " <p> I argued ; I used persuasion ; I even tried to appeal to his better nature , but I got nowhere . Finally I walked out . But I was not licked yet . <p> Having exhausted all direct methods , I decided to use an indirect , or strategic , approach . I looked up the only radio-and-television shop in town . By this time , it was five in the afternoon , and the sound truck , which had been bellowing through the streets all day , was now parked in silence in front of the shop . I interviewed the proprietor and found that the truck and sound equipment belonged to him and were rented out to Mr. McDonald on a day-to-day basis . <p> " Would you rent the stuff to me for a few days ? " I asked . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. McDonald rented it first , I kind of have to go along with him . Of course , if you wanted to buy it  --  " <p> " I do not need the truck , " I said . " How much do you want for the sound equipment ? " <p> " Well , it 's several years old , but it 's in very good shape . How would $500 be ? " <p> " Do you have any other sound equipment that could be used in a truck like this ? " <p> " No , I do n't . " <p> " Do you know of any more that could be bought anywhere in town here ? " <p> " No . " <p> " All right , " I said , " I will give you $500 for your outfit . " <p> The radio-shop proprietor took the apparatus out of the truck and loaded it into the rear seat of my car . I paid him with traveler 's checks . Then I drove back to Mr. Pike 's house . <p> " Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report that our bold approach to Mr. McDonald has met with complete success . The poor man thinks that the dam has shifted a little more . He has no flood insurance on any of his equipment . He is so anxious to get hold of a big tractor and move his property out of danger that his former insolent manner has changed to an attitude of abject surrender . The man was as putty in my hands . " <p> " What happened ? " <p> " He agreed to abandon his entire campaign against your road . Tomorrow morning you will be able to enjoy your breakfast in peace and quiet , completely free from the hideous noises of Mr. McDonald 's insulting campaign speeches . No longer will the peace and quiet of Rock City be disturbed by that despicable sound truck . " <p> " That 's wonderful ! Did you tell Mr. McDonald that he could borrow my tractor ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " But that may not be possible , Mr. Botts . My operator has come down with the flu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to tell me he was going home to bed and was afraid he might be laid up for several days . " <p> " Mr. Pike , " I said , " I am sorry your operator is incapacitated , but this need not interfere with our plans . I would not want Mr. McDonald to think we are backing down on our end of the bargain ; he might be tempted to back down on his . I will therefore take charge of your tractor tomorrow morning . I will drive it up to Mr. McDonald 's pathetic dry oil well . I will haul his equipment up out of the canyon , a job which I think I can finish in three or four hours . By tomorrow evening , I will have your tractor back working on the parking-lot job at the entrance of your cave . You need have no fears . I am one of the best tractor operators in the country . And , as sales manager of the great Earthworm Company , I hereby pledge all the resources of this great organization to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your machine while it is in my charge . " <p> " That is very kind of you , Mr. Botts . I accept your offer . " <p> I drove back to the hotel , where I have been spending the evening writing this report . As you can see , Henderson , I have handled this situation with my usual skill . By following the principles which you undoubtedly wanted your ghost writer to set forth in that pamphlet , I have caused each of these quarrelsome customers to think that I am on his side . And I have accomplished this happy result , not by resorting to falsehoods or fraud , but merely by slanting the truth so as to make each of these people think he is coming out on top . In the end , of course , each of them actually will come out on top . Mr. Pike will be free  --  at least for a while  --  from the annoying uproar of that sound truck . Mr. McDonald will have his equipment moved to a place of safety by an Earthworm tractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy Earthworm machinery from now on , thus acquiring a superior line of equipment and providing Hank Harper , our dealer , with a very nice addition to his business . This also means more business for the Earthworm Company . <p> I am sure you will agree that all of these advantages more than make up for the somewhat exorbitant price I was forced to pay for the sound equipment , and I would appreciate it if you would tell our comptroller that he is to forget his annoying habit of objecting to expenses which he does not understand , and is to pass without question this $500 item which I am including in my expense account . <p> It is now almost midnight . I will therefore turn in for some well-deserved rest . And I will send you this report by air mail early in the morning . <p> Yours , Alexander Botts <p> P.S. Next morning , Tuesday , January 7 , 1958 . <p> Since I wrote you last night , there have been a couple of developments which I can only describe as definitely disturbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still in bed , Mr. McDonald  --  who seems to be an early riser  --  called me by telephone . He was so angry as to be almost incoherent , but I finally gathered that he had heard from the radio man of my purchase of the sound equipment . And he accused me of making an underhanded attempt to shut down his righteous campaign for the taxpayers , so that I could borrow Mr. Pike 's tractor , move his  --  Mr. McDonald 's  --  equipment out of the canyon , and thus sufficiently ingratiate myself with him so that I could sell him a lot of Earthworm equipment . He went on to say he was through with me and with the Earthworm Company forever , and that he had just telephoned to a radio dealer in a town 20 miles away and arranged to have a new sound truck operating almost at once  --  even if he had to start out by riding around in the truck himself , broadcasting his speeches live . He then hung up . <p> As I could not , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I refrained from calling Mr. McDonald back . I got dressed . At about 8:00 , as I was enjoying a hearty breakfast , I heard a sound truck going by in the street , blatting forth a statement that " the Pike conspiracy to rob the public treasury has now conspired with the Earthworm Tractor Company in an attempt to silence all criticism . But the forces of righteousness must and shall prevail ! " <p> Almost at once I had a telephone call from Mr. Pike . He said , " I thought you told me that Mr. McDonald was going to shut down his sound truck . " <p> " Obviously , " I said , " the man has double-crossed us . " <p> " Then I wo n't lend him my tractor . " <p> " And you are quite right , Mr. Pike . Believe me , sir , I am as disappointed about this as you are . We 'll just have to figure out some other way to shut him up . In the meantime , as long as your operator is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to operate your tractor for you and continue the work of grading your parking lot . " <p> " I do n't know that I quite trust you , Mr. Botts . After all , you deceived me . You told me Mr. McDonald was going to shut down his sound truck . " <p> " I was deceived as badly as you , Mr. Pike . But , even so , I feel guilty for having unintentionally misled you . It is for this reason that I want to do everything possible to make up for my fault . " <p> " All right , Mr. Botts . If you will come over here to the house , I will drive you down into the canyon . And I will stay with you all day to make sure you get along all right . " <p> " OK , " I said and hung up . Since then I have put in ten or 15 minutes writing this brief postscript to my report . <p> As you can well understand , Henderson , the difficult situation this morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me somewhat nonplused . If I were the kind of man who gets discouraged easily , I would , at this point , almost be discouraged . I do not have the faintest idea how I am going to get out of this mess . So I will merely continue my plan of cooperating with Mr. Pike in the hope that I can find some new method of persuading him to let me use his tractor to help Mr. McDonald . <p> I will now mail this report and proceed as planned to the house of Mr. Pike <p> Hastily , A. Botts <p> Earthworm Tractor Company Earthworm City , Illinois Office of the President <p> Wednesday , January 8 , 1958 <p> Dear Botts : I feel that your so-called " defense " of my pamphlet is most unfortunate . Please tell Mr. Henry Harper that I wrote that pamphlet myself , and I am at a loss to know where you got the idea that I use a ghost writer , or that I resemble in any way the justices of the United States Supreme Court . <p> From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound equipment has been worse than useless . Such being the case , I am instructing our comptroller to disapprove your $500 expense item . Furthermore , the Earthworm Company can assume no responsibility for any damage which may occur to Mr. Pike 's tractor while in your charge . <p> As I have often told you in the past , your job as sales manager is to coordinate and advise  --  not to rush out in the field and take charge of operations . In the present situation , you have succeeded only in antagonizing a very important customer , Mr. McDonald . And you have quite obviously failed to impress Mr. Pike with your offer to work as an ordinary tractor operator . <p> I would suggest , therefore , that before you get into any more trouble , you turn everything back to Hank Harper and return to your more normal activities as sales manager . <p> Very truly , Gilbert Henderson President <p> TELEGRAM <p> ROCK CITY , TEX .

" <p> It will no doubt interest you to know that , in spite of Hank 's telegram , I was never in any trouble at all . On Tuesday morning , after mailing my report to you , I called on Mr. Pike . He drove me down into the canyon , where I spent the day grading his parking lot with his tractor . Mr. Pike , who seems to have a very suspicious nature , stayed around the whole day , watching me . For some reason he just did not seem to trust me . But , by the end of the afternoon , he had apparently decided I was on the level . And , after we had driven back to his house , he told me he would not go with me the following day . <p> " However , " he said . " I will be listening at the top of the canyon to the noise of that tractor . If you try any funny business , I will know about it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that he was afraid I might want to borrow the tractor to drive up and help out Mr. McDonald . And , by a strange coincidence , that is exactly what I had in mind . I also had a plan for allaying Mr. Pike 's suspicions . After leaving him , I called on the radio man from whom I had bought the sound equipment . I arranged for him to help me . <p> The next morning we both drove down into the canyon . We unloaded the sound equipment and , while I operated the tractor from eight until noon , he made a four-hour tape recording of the sound of the exhaust . I then drove the tractor up the canyon . The radio man , after setting up his machine at the site to play back the recording , followed in the company car . <p> When I arrived at Mr. McDonald 's drill rig , I found that the new Goliath tractor had not yet showed up , so I got to work . It took me only about two hours to move Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the miscellaneous equipment up out of the canyon . All the time I was working , the dam seemed to be cracking and crumbling . <p> And finally , at about four o'clock in the afternoon , the whole thing let go all at once , and a stupendous wall of water went roaring down the canyon . When I got back to town , I was so tired that I merely paused to eat a hearty dinner before going to bed . It was not until the next day that I saw the various people concerned . <p> I am happy to report that Mr. McDonald is so pleased at the way I saved his valuable equipment that he is heeding my request and giving up his campaign against Mr. Pike . Also he is placing a large order for Earthworm machinery . Mr. Pike is so pleased at the way I saved his tractor and persuaded Mr. McDonald to lay off that he has forgiven me the slight deception I practiced on him . And Hank Harper , slowly recovering from the flu , is very happy about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of being wrong , are now completely right  --  thus lending an air of plausibility to your pamphlet . So I feel that you should be happy enough to carry out your " Spare no expense " philosophy by telling the comptroller to allow my $500 item for the sound equipment that perished in the flood while carrying out such a useful mission . <p> And , finally , one of the happiest people around here at present is your highly competent sales manager , <p> Alexander Botts <p>
