<p> Columbia Michael Reese Hospital recently asked nurse Donna McDonald what she would do to change the institution where she worked for nearly two decades , met her husband and gave birth to two of her children . <p> She reminisced for a few moments , then wrote these words : " Dismantle it . " <p> McDonald 's profound disillusionment had little to do with the yearlong federal Medicare investigation of Reese 's owner , Columbia ; HCA Healthcare Corp . It had more to do with the little things , such as Popsicles . <p> When she started at the Chicago hospital 17 years ago , the wards had refrigerators filled with goodies such as juice , milk and , where children were patients , plenty of Popsicles . Sometimes , nurses would raid the refrigerators for snacks . But when a sick child wanted a Popsicle , it was right at hand . <p> These days , Reese has a control policy . Refrigerator supplies are tightly regulated , with amounts based on prior use . That means the refrigerators sometimes run low , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make do with water instead of juice . " They made a simple gesture of caring into a bureaucratic exercise , " McDonald says . <p> To Michael Reese President F. Scott Winslow , however , her complaint " goes to show how isolated Donna was from the real world . " <p> The reality , Winslow says , is that Reese , 2929 S. Ellis , " nearly vanished from the face of the earth " because of huge losses it sustained before managers began watching costs , large and small . " Someone needed to get responsible about tracking who was spending what . " <p> Popsicles are a small item in the argument over health care in America . But the changes that McDonald saw , as an elite nurse at what was once one of the nation 's most prestigious hospitals , explain a lot about public disaffection with the medical industry . There is a sense among many that in the effort to keep costs from skyrocketing , the caring part of health care is getting lost . <p> This concern has translated into a backlash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry 's giant pending a breakup that would spin off about a third of its 338 hospitals . Proposals in Congress would rein in health maintenance organizations and enact a bill of rights for patients . <p> Since taking over Columbia ; HCA in July , CEO Thomas F. Frist Jr . has been making the case that solid profits and quality care can coexist . As he visits company hospitals around the country , he repeats his message : Columbia should put patients first . <p> " We must run a business that allows us to do our very best in providing patient care , " he says . " A patient does n't ask , ' How 's the stock price doing ? ' " <p> But the struggle to find that balance is taking a toll at hospitals such as Reese , once one of America 's premier charitable research and teaching hospitals . Founded in 1881 with a bequest by Michael Reese , a German Jewish immigrant who made a fortune in real estate , it started by catering to Chicago 's Jewish immigrants and later became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train Jewish physicians . <p> Reese took pride in a tradition of medical innovation  --  and in its stature in the city . It was one of the first hospitals to use an incubator for infants . Its scientists did breakthrough research on the links between cholesterol and heart disease . Reese 's annual fund-raiser , the Crystal Ball , was the highlight of the Chicago social season . <p> These days , Michael Reese is a shell of its former self . Business has plunged from more than 170,000 patient days in 1990  --  around the time of the hospital 's conversion into a for-profit institution  --  to 116,000 when Columbia took it over in 1993 , to around 100,000 last year . <p> Michael Reese 's occupancy rate dwindled to 33 percent last year , the Illinois Public Health Department says . While Chicago as a whole has too many hospital beds , Reese 's not-for-profit rival at the University of Chicago enjoys overall occupancy rates of 64 percent , while units such as neonatal intensive care are 93 percent full . <p> Reese has come under significant scrutiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted a special review of the hospital , following complaints of poor patient care , and warned that the hospital was in danger of being yanked from Medicare . The agency criticized Reese for , among other things , inadequate nursing care . <p> Since then , the hospital has been found in compliance in most areas . Meanwhile , it faces a review by the Illinois Public Aid Department of its billing practices for Medicaid . <p> Winslow , who took over at Reese a year ago , says the hospital is working closely with the government to resolve such issues . As for the lower patient counts , he says they are typical at big-city hospitals . " Michael Reese is doing very , very well , " he says . <p> Nevertheless , Columbia announced last weekend that it wanted to sell Reese . Winslow is fighting to preserve the hospital  --  and possibly sell it to a local medical group  --  but says it is hard when people such as McDonald wax nostalgic about the good old days . <p> " I am getting really nervous that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a standard sort of like Brigadoon "  --  the mythical , idyllic village where time would stop for 100-year intervals . " I wish that I could go back to 1972 . But I ca n't , " Winslow said . <p> McDonald , meanwhile , is confronting at age 39 a more personal crisis . She began her nursing career in 1980 . She recalls a world that now seems outdated . <p> Her first assignment was on Reese 's pioneering five-bed unit for patients undergoing open-heart surgery . McDonald loved Reese 's overlay of cultures and sense of mission . The hospital had taken on the challenge of serving the inner-city poor . It was on a vast college-like campus . <p> McDonald longed to emulate her co-workers ' dedication . One veteran nurse , Mary Diamond , often ran out during her lunch hour to buy pink sponge curlers ; she then would wash and set the hair of her female patients , many of whom were on respirators . <p> Diamond viewed the curlers as a talisman , believing " that if the patients were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " McDonald says . " And they would feel better because their hair was clean . " <p> Supplies were abundant . At holiday times , the nurses used gauze bandages to make decorations to brighten the unit . Around Halloween , " we would make these little ghosts out of white gauze and hang them from the ceilings , " McDonald says . " Wasteful ? Yup . Darn cute , though . " <p> The hospital 's campus evoked an era of elegance . Rothschild House was the nurses ' residence ; it had a large fireplace and gilded ceilings . Courtships took place on the great lawn outside the Dreyfus Research Laboratories . <p> McDonald made friends with staff , bantered with the doctors  --  and eventually married one of them , a pediatric intensive care specialist . <p> But by the late 1980s , reputation and reality were diverging sharply at Michael Reese . Many of the affluent families who once supported the hospital had moved to the suburbs . The neighborhood around the hospital was declining . Meanwhile , the hospital had severed its connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reese 's board decided to sell out to Humana Inc. , a powerful for-profit chain then building a network of hospitals and HMOs . <p> Reese had an HMO of its own , and it was one of the few shining spots in its bleak portfolio . In negotiations , Humana made it clear that what it really wanted was Reese 's HMO , not the money-losing hospital itself . But Reese board members said it was all or nothing . <p> The deal cast a cold light on Reese 's decline . Humana was ready to buy the HMO for $ 120 million . But when the hospital was thrown in , the price for both properties together dropped to about $ 90 million . And Humana was given tens of millions more by Reese 's foundation to care for indigent patients . <p> Gordon Prussian , then chairman of the hospital 's board , says selling Reese was the only option . " You ca n't run a $ 200 million operation on nostalgia , " he says . <p> Nancy Carlstedt , a former Humana administrator who helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Reese was a mess by the time Humana moved in . <p> Thefts of computers and medical supplies were rampant . Old buildings that were costly to heat were being used by only a handful of people . <p> Within a couple of years , Humana decided to concentrate more heavily on managed care . Most of its hospitals were spun off , and Michael Reese went under Columbia 's management . <p> The company 's hard-driving boss , Rick Scott , arrived in late 1993 . He wanted Columbia to dominate the Chicago market , and he saw Michael Reese as the way to get a foothold in the city . <p> Scott got personally involved . To boost staff spirit , he rented the Field Museum of Natural History for a daylong party for employees and their children . <p> Columbia made a few more acquisitions in the area , snapping up some suburban hospitals and faltering community hospitals . But it was stymied in its efforts to buy more elite hospitals . <p> In hindsight , Columbia may have underestimated the level of hostility and competition it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with six academic centers and schools to support , " Carlstedt says . <p> The changes took their toll on the physicians , who started sending their patients elsewhere . <p> Winslow says he is now trying to improve physician retention and recruitment . He notes that he recently lured a top physician from Boston to head up a new asthma center at Reese . <p> Columbia 's changes hit staffers such as McDonald particularly hard . Some departments were downsized . Social workers , trained to help patients deal with problems related to their illnesses and care , were among the first to go . Most were replaced by " case managers " whose duties were primarily limited to planning a patient 's discharge from the hospital . <p> Winslow says many hospitals have cut down on social workers . But the University of Chicago Medical Center says it still has 33 social workers on staff . <p> Some nurses were irked when Columbia placed medications and supplies in cabinets with combination locks . The objective was twofold : to secure the supplies and to ensure that patients were charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says such systems are standard in the industry . " It is fair that we capture everything that we use on a patient , and if this system has a by-product of helping us keep more accurate records , I do n't see any problem , " he says . " Money is part of it , but is not all of it . " <p> McDonald saw the locks as an affront . " In order to get even a Band-Aid , you had to punch in a code . I understand the need for inventory control , but it got so ridiculous , " she says . <p> Just as annoying to McDonald and her colleagues were the time clocks . Nurses always had worked on an honor system , tracking their hours on a sheet . But now the company asked the nurses to punch a clock  --  as nurses at many other hospitals do . <p> Doctors often were just as irritated by the changes . They long had enjoyed the ability to splurge at the hospital 's Garden Restaurant , more upscale than the staff cafeteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a McDonald 's outlet . <p> The doctors protested , arguing that fatty fast food was the antithesis of good health . But Columbia ruled in favor of McDonald 's , and the franchise opened  --  next door to the waiting room for cardiac surgery patients . <p> Carlstedt , who at the time was president and chief executive officer of Michael Reese , says the physicians ' own attitude helped fuel the changes . The Garden Restaurant , she says , was elitist , with some tables reserved only for doctors . McDonald 's provided a friendlier environment for patients ' families and also raised revenue for Columbia . <p> Meanwhile , last year , the cardiac surgery unit where Donna McDonald worked was merged into a new , bigger intensive care unit that Columbia was building for $ 3.5 million . <p> To Winslow , the consolidation made perfect sense . " I have never seen a five-bed , open-heart ICU anywhere in my career , " he says . <p> Those in the cardiac unit saw things differently . They wanted to keep their patients apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once a surgeon at Reese , says small intensive care units are n't obsolete . He left to head a similar one at Ingalls Memorial . <p> For many of the nurses , the change was devastating . Mary Diamond , provider of the pink curlers , decided she had had enough and quit . McDonald hung on . <p> Columbia began parceling out many tasks previously done by nurses to people with less training and lower wages . Even intensive care was to get " critical-care technicians , " or unlicensed aides who would assist the nurses . <p> " We experiment from time to time with different staffing patterns throughout the hospital , " Winslow says . The hospital withdrew the technicians from the unit in October , and now only registered nurses work there . <p> McDonald says patients are paying a price . Take shaving , for example . Early in her career , she was instructed that men on respirators should be shaved every day . " There is nothing worse for a man than not to be shaven , " she says . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive , looking like a homeless man . " <p> But shaving a patient on a respirator requires two nurses , one to manipulate the breathing tube and the other to work the razor . As a result of cutbacks , shaving was being done every other day and sometimes less often . <p> Meanwhile , bath time for patients , which McDonald called one of her most important tasks , also was being done by technicians . She had used bath time to check for bedsores and other problems . " You looked at your patient from head to toe , " she says . <p> " But now , the nurse is not the person who gives the bath . And signs get missed because an unlicensed person . . . wo n't notice that a patient is grimacing when you wash their belly "  --  often a sign of internal infection or bleeding . <p> Despite her misgivings , McDonald was doing well in her career , working as a " nurse clinician , " a job that allowed her to roam freely , supervising patients until their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitor what was going on in other parts of Reese . <p> Reese increased the patient-to-nurse ratio in intensive care , something Winslow says was made possible by advances in technology . " The number of things a nurse has to do at the bedside is now different , " he says , " because so much of the new technology is automated . " <p> But to McDonald , the tight staffing meant there was less time to provide solace to patients . <p> " Even when a patient cries and says , ' Please do n't leave me , ' you know there is a patient next door who needs to be suctioned and turned , " she says . " And if it is a little old lady who you know is dying , you ca n't stay in there , and you ca n't even go get her a social worker because there are no social workers . " <p> By last summer , Columbia ; HCA was in full upheaval . Federal agents had raided its facilities in El Paso , Texas , as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Frist had taken over . <p> The doctor 's ascendancy gave McDonald cause for hope . Corporate headquarters distributed memos heralding a culture in which patients would come first . But McDonald says she saw no evidence of new priorities . <p> What will happen next at Michael Reese is n't clear . Winslow notes that the area around the hospital is bouncing back . Nearby McCormick Place convention center has expanded , and a new hotel is being built . The University of Chicago has expressed an interest in buying Reese , as have local physicians . <p> But others suggest Reese could be worth more dead than alive . <p> " It is a great piece of property  --  maybe the largest undeveloped piece of land in Chicago , " says Miles Berger , a developer whose wife , Sally , once chaired the Crystal Ball for Reese . Berger says some of the grand old buildings on the lakefront could be turned into trendy apartments . <p> McDonald wo n't be around for the end , whatever it is . She quit in October . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because care for the dying is an area where human contact remains paramount : " There is more of a chance for me to be the kind of nurse I want to be . "
