The shattered glass glittered like fairy dust against the black asphalt . Natalie pushed herself back to a run , even though she was just finishing the cool-down after her daily ritual . Half a dozen people - her neighbors ?  --  stood talking on the sidewalk next to her parked car . The red ' 67 Mustang sported a fresh tattoo of bullet holes along the driver 's side door . <p> " What happened ? " Natalie said . She was breathless from running and her ponytail was sticky against the back of her neck . It was dusk , the front edge of summer , and the evening breathed warm sweet air against her face . <p> A tall man said , " We heard the shots and came out . A car was pulling away , but all we could see was it was big and dark . Looked like an older car . " <p> A blond man added , " American make , I think . We could n't get the license number . Sorry . " <p> Natalie looked at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes . Cleanly pierced , they were half again as wide as her fingertip . <p> For a dizzy instant , she tasted sheared metal . With a jolt , a memory caught her : blurred images of a golden-haired man shoving another man against the fender , shouting , " Stay away from her , damn you ! You 're taking her over , trying to own her  --  if you come here again I 'll kill you ! " Spit flew from his mouth as he yelled , sparkled on his chipped front tooth . A sickening crunch as the other man was slammed against the fender again , colorless hair whipping around his face , fingers curling around the antenna , bones cracking  --  <p> Natalie jerked her hand away . She 'd never remembered that before . She stood there , blinking at the three neat holes in the car door and fender , low , near the tire well . And a fourth shot to knock out the window , she realized . <p> " Your insurance will cover it , " the blond man said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man asked . <p> " I  --  " She stopped . " I do n't remember . " <p> The blond man opened the passenger door . A shower of glass bits fell out , a shimmering rain that was faintly blue-green . He stepped over them , opened the glove compartment , and removed some papers . " Here 's a policy  --  looks like you do , " he said . <p> Natalie bent down and picked up three of the glass shards . She cupped them in her left palm and examined them . They were rough ovoids , almost as thick as they were long . Sunlight glinted from them ; the sparkle mesmerized her . <p> " You hear them shots ? " said one of the neighbors , a short plump woman with curly dark hair . " Sound just like firecrackers , ' pop-pop , pop-pop . ' You know , I just about forgot how a gun sound . I called the cops . " <p> Natalie nodded . " Okay . " <p> The woman held out her hand . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay ? You looking pale . " <p> Natalie had taken Mary 's hand reflexively . She shook hands and started to let go , but Mary put her other hand over Natalie 's and patted . <p> " Need to get you a charm or something , maybe a blue bead for your car , ward off the evil eye , you know . " <p> " Maybe so , " Natalie said . <p> " You looking pale , " the woman repeated . <p> " I  --  oh . I guess I do feel a little clammy . " <p> Mary helped her sit on the curb and said , " Put your head down . " <p> Natalie did . The throb of her heartbeat in her ears sounded like the rush of enormous wings . Her evening routine had shattered like the window . She stared at the star-like shimmer of glass on the pavement and wondered what was going to happen . <p> The police were kind and dispassionate . One of them dug the bullets out of her car while the other took down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew anyone who had a grudge against her . <p> " No , " Natalie said . She was still sitting on the curb , hugging her knees . " No one . " It was true . <p> The policeman glanced at Mary inquiringly . She shrugged . He looked back at Natalie . " You said you work at the university , Ms. Emerson . " He consulted his clipboard . " Counseling students , is that right ? " <p> She nodded . " Course advisor . " <p> " College kids get upset about stuff . Maybe one of them is mad at you , maybe ca n't get a class they need to graduate , something like that ? " <p> She thought about it , trying to concentrate over the sound of her pulse whooshing in her ears . She could n't remember anything . " No , " she said after a minute . " I do n't think so . We 've had a fairly peaceful semester . Besides , none of the students know where I live . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay . Here 's your copy of the report  --  your insurance company will want to see it . If you get any more disturbances or have more information about the incident , call this number . " He handed her a card with his name on it : Officer James Herrera . <p> He turned to go , but stopped when Mary asked , " You been getting a lotta drive-bys round here ? " <p> " Yes  --  that is , no , ma'am , " he said . " Not this area in particular . But summertime and all , once it 's warmer , you get a lot more . " <p> Mary seemed to consider that for a second . " Okay , " she said . <p> " Yes , ma'am , " he said , and left . <p> Natalie was holding the police report in one hand and the glass bits in the other . She sat on the curb until Mary helped her up and walked her toward the door of her duplex . The blond man , whose name was Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thank you , " Natalie said to him as they passed . <p> He looked up at her and smiled , but did n't answer . <p> " Thank you , " she said again as Mary pushed open the door to Natalie 's unit . <p> Mary hesitated . " You gon na call somebody ? Your family ? Got a sweetie ? " <p> " I 'm okay , " Natalie said . <p> Mary said , " Somebody got to stay with you . Just till you sure it ai n't some nutcase out after you . Or maybe you want to stay with your folks ? Where they live ? " <p> " They  --  no , they 're dead . I could stay with my boyfriend . " <p> " Fine , " Mary said . " You call him . I 'll check back to you in a little bit . " She turned away from the open doorway . <p> It had gone dark while they waited for the police , and she had n't left any of her lights on . Natalie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her thigh on the blanket chest that jutted into the hall , and groped for the light switch in the living room . Her knee thudded against the Victorian loveseat , and she heard an ominous creak from its arthritic arm as she found the switch . <p> The Tiffany lamp on the desk immediately behind her came on , its outlet controlled by the wall switch . The telephone table was to one side of the Duncan Phyfe sofa , so she picked her way across the Kismet rug , around the Queen 's chair with its gold brocade . Stepping over the French wire basket filled with antique wooden bobbins wound with thick cotton thread , she reached the sofa and sat down on its plump striped cushions . The satin was cool and slick under her bare thighs . <p> The plain beige phone looked out of place against the ornate carvings of the table . Natalie picked up the receiver and dialed Paul 's number , a familiar little digital song that brought things into focus for a second . <p> He answered after the third ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he said , sounding a little out of breath . <p> " Paul ? " Her gaze traveled around the room , over the gilt-framed paintings and the Persian shawl that hung beside the upright piano . She could n't seem to remember what she was supposed to say . <p> " Nat ? Is that you ? What 's the matter , honey ? You sound upset . " <p> " I do ? " She slid her feet out of her shoes and curled her toes up . <p> " What 's wrong ? " Paul asked , his voice sharper now . <p> That 's right , she thought . Something 's wrong . " Can I come stay with you tonight ? " she said . <p> " What 's happened ? Are you okay ? " <p> " I 'm fine , " she said . Mary squeezed through the entry hall , and Natalie waved to her . Mary looked around the living room , shaking her head . <p> Paul was speaking again . "  --  just got in . Start at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you been hurt ? " <p> " No , " Natalie said . " Just someone shot my car . " <p> " Your car ? " <p> Mary said , " He coming ? How long till he gets here ? I 'll wait a little bit with you . " She threaded her way through the maze and seated herself on the Queen 's chair . <p> Natalie said to Mary , " It 's okay , I 'll spend the night over there . " <p> " Who 's gon na carry you there ? " Mary said . " Your car ai n't gon na drive right now . Bob says you got ta have a mechanic . One of them bullets went into the motor . " <p> Paul said , " I heard that . I 'll be right over . " <p> " No , " she said . " Not here  --  I mean , it 's not necessary , Paul . I 'll call a cab . " <p> " Do n't be silly , " he said . " You live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there in fifteen minutes . What 's the address ? " <p> " I  --  you really do n't need to come here , " Natalie said . " I 'm fine . Honest . " <p> Mary reached over and plucked the receiver from her hand . " This her neighbor , " she said . " She looking pale , you better come . Number 1606-B Bluebonnet . " She listened a minute , then said , " Okay . I 'll tell her . " <p> She leaned over and hung the phone up . " That 's a ugly table , " she said . " Why you want to keep something like that ? Get you something nice at Lack 's . " Then she pulled herself out of the Queen 's chair and added , " Pretty chair , though . He 'll be here in fifteen minutes . Sounds like a good man . " She patted Natalie on the shoulder , then began tracing her way back toward the door . <p> " My place just across and down one , number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper for the kids now , but you call on me if you be needing anything . " As she pulled the door to , Natalie heard her say , " God 's love , she got a lotta stuff in there . " <p> Natalie considered not answering the doorbell when it rang twelve minutes later . Paul was the first man she 'd dated in  --  how long ? She could n't really remember . But she knew it was too soon for him to see her living room . They 'd only met a few months ago . <p> Rapid knocking followed the insistent ringing of the bell . " Natalie ? " he called . " Are you okay ? " <p> His voice cracked a little on the last word , and she realized he was panicked . She uncurled from the Duncan Phyfe sofa and slid her shoes back on . She did n't like to walk on the carpet barefoot . <p> As soon as she opened the door , Paul pushed inside and took her in his arms . He was trembling slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you 'd been inside it  --  " He kissed her . <p> His mouth was warm , and Natalie felt some of the vagueness drop away from her . She drew back after a moment and said , " Thanks for coming . " <p> He laughed and pushed at his pale brown hair , the color of a moth 's wings . His little finger was crooked , curved like a claw even when the other fingers were flat . " I know you like your privacy , " he said . " But this is scary . Did anyone see who did it ? " <p> Natalie shook her head . " Just that it was someone in a big car . Nobody got the license number . " <p> " Damn . You called the police ? " <p> " Yes . They gave me a report for the insurance company . " <p> " Yeah , we 'll call first thing tomorrow to have the car towed in . One of the bullets went into the engine  --  you 'll have to have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix it , wo n't they ? " she said , suddenly anxious . " I wo n't have to get a new car ? " <p> " Well , if you do , your insurance company will pay for it , " he said . " Hey , we going to stand in the hall all night ? It 's a tight squeeze . " He tapped on the glass front of ' the china cabinet . <p> " But they 'll probably fix it , instead , wo n't they ? " she said . <p> " Yeah , sure , " Paul said . " C'm on , let 's sit down . " <p> She hesitated for a second , then led him past the blanket chest , around the loveseat , and across the carpet to the sofa . <p> " God , you 've got a lot of furniture , " he said . " You know , I 've never seen your place before ? " The toe of one of his running shoes caught the wire basket and thread bobbins spilled everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's okay , " Natalie said , her voice barely above a whisper . She knelt on the Kismet rug to stack the bobbins back in the basket . The bright colors of the thread soothed her . " I know it 's crowded in here . " <p> " Lots of antiques , " he said , sitting gingerly on the sofa . " You never told me you were an antique-hunter . " <p> " I 'm not really , " she said . " All these things belonged to my family . " <p> " Oh , " he said . " Hand-me-downs , huh ? " He glanced around . " Pretty ritzy ones . All my folks ever gave me was a formica dinette set . " <p> Natalie finished picking up the bobbins and sat on the sofa next to Paul . " Could we spend the night at your place ? " she said . " It would only take a few minutes to pack , and I could ride to work with you in the morning . " <p> " Already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never stay with me two nights in a row , so I brought some things with me . We can just go from here in the morning . If you really want to go to work , that is . Maybe you should take a few days off . " <p> " No , " she said , panicked . " No , I have to go to work . I ca n't miss days , it  --  it upsets my routine . " <p> He frowned . " It 's not that big a deal , Natalie . I think you should just take things easy , but if you want to go , okay . I 'll need to drop you off at the comer , though , and have you walk the rest of the way , so Dean Whittsen wo n't find out we 're seeing each other . " <p> " I  --  okay , " she said . " But could we stay at your house ? " <p> Paul smiled at her . It was one of the first things she 'd liked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he smiled . It made her feel as if she 'd known him forever . <p> " Oh , no , " he said . " I just got here , and already I know things about you I never knew before . You 've been so secretive . Elusive . Now that I 'm here , I want to stay awhile . " He reached over and drew her onto his lap , one hand stroking her hip under her running shorts . " You know , I was starting to wonder if you were married ? " he whispered , and kissed her throat . <p> They made love on the Duncan Phyfe , something Natalie found faintly scandalous . What would her mother say if the satin striped cushions got stained ? Then she remembered her mother was dead . No explanations would be required . <p> Afterward , Paul slid down and licked her midriff , just under her left breast . " Mmmm , " he said . " Salty . " <p> She stirred uneasily . " I just got back from running when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel him smile ; his mouth tickled her ribs . " I like it , " he said . <p> " They 'll be able to fix my car , wo n't they ? " she asked . " It was my brother 's car , I would n't want anything to happen to it . " <p> " I do n't know , honey , " he said , rolling to one side and picking up his jeans . " You 've never said anything about having a brother before . Or about your family . Where do they live ? " <p> " Um , they 're dead . " <p> He turned his head to look at her . " All of them ? " <p> Natalie sat up , drawing her legs to her chest . " Uh-huh . " <p> He was watching her . " You 've never told me that , either , Nat . What happened ? Where did they live ? " <p> She grabbed her shirt off the floor and pulled it over her head . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until she had the shirt on , then reached over and took her hands . " I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to upset you . It 's just important to me to know you . It 's part of feeling close to someone , Natalie . " <p> She said , " It 's okay , " and pulled away from him to put on her shorts . <p> " So tell me , " he said , buttoning his jeans . " Where did you grow up ? " <p> " I 'm getting hungry all of a sudden , how about you ? Let 's go grab a sandwich or something . What are you in the mood for ? " <p> His brows drew together . " I 'm in the mood , " he said distinctly , " for you to tell me what 's going on with you . " <p> " What do you mean ? " Natalie said , tugging on her running shoes . She bent down and tightened the laces . <p> He caught her hands and drew her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I care so much , and we 've only known each other a couple of months . I have to know things about you , what you looked like when you were seven and missing a front tooth , what color your first bike was , all kinds of stuff . Why wo n't you talk to me ? " <p> He paused , clearly waiting for her to answer , but she turned her face away . Her body was stiff and flushed . <p> He said , " I 've told you all about my family , what it was like growing up with twin brothers who were three years older than me , what my folks are like . " He held up his right hand , with the crooked little finger . " How I broke this playing baseball , all kinds of stuff . But I do n't know where you lived when you were a kid , or what religion your family is . Hell , I do n't even know why you 'll never spend two nights in a row with me ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I love you , " he said . " Talk to me , okay ? " <p> Listening to him , hearing the timbre of his voice and feeling the warmth of his hand against her face , Natalie had an eerie sensation of vertigo , as if she were perched at the top of a well and had just lost her balance . As if she were still poised , unmoving , at the beginning of an inevitable fall . <p> Heat flowed up her chest , her throat , her face , and she found that she was crying , large silent salty drops plopping from her chin to her T-shirt . Paul 's intent face seemed to melt and blur in front of her . <p> " I do n't know , " Natalie said , over the whooshing of her pulse in her ears . " I ca n't tell you any of that stuff , because I do n't remember . " <p> THEY ENDED up eating take-out Chinese food at the huge claw-footed mahogany table that dominated Natalie 's small dining room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's nothing wrong with me , " Natalie said again as she picked up a shrimp roll with her chopsticks . They were pointed and elegant , black lacquer inlaid with mother-of-pearl . Where had they come from ? " I remember some things . For instance , " she closed her eyes and ran her fingers along the edge of the table , " I know that this table was my great-grandmother 's . I can remember it sitting in her dining room , with the French doors on one side . And there was a built-in sideboard with a thick glass mirror over it , that deep blue-green glass with beveled edges . " <p> " How old were you then ? " Paul asked . He was rummaging through the stir-fry looking for more snow-peas . <p> Natalie was chewing her shrimp roll and did n't answer immediately . Then she said , " I 'm not sure . But I have this clear picture of the table , set with a crocheted tablecloth . And I remember the way the wood floor shone with wax and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great-grandmother 's hair was . Her name was Amelia . " <p> " And your brother ? " Paul said . " What was his name ? " <p> Natalie touched the glass fragments in the pocket of her shorts and concentrated , fearful of the new pictures she had seen when she touched the bullet holes earlier . But beyond the taste of torn metal and smoke , she found the only image she had of him : tanned arms rubbing a chamois across gleaming apple-red paint . " Best engine Ford ever built . " She was standing behind him , watching him work . She could hear his voice , see the way the hairs on his bare arm went gold in the sunlight . But she could n't see his face . And she did n't know his name . <p> " I ca n't remember , " she whispered . She picked up another shrimp roll and cleared her throat . " I remember him waxing the car , talking about it having a  --  a 286 engine . He said it was the best engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 289 , " Paul said . " Have you had any neurological tests ? " <p> " I told you , the doctor said it 's nothing to worry about . " <p> " Your doctor does n't sound like he has any concern at all about your mental health , " Paul said . He found another snow-pea and stabbed it with his chopstick . <p> " It 's not that big a deal , " Natalie said . " I 'm just a little foggy about my childhood . It 's not that unusual . " <p> " When did your parents die ? " he said . <p> There was a line of tension around his voice that made her anxious . He was already losing patience with her and all her possessions . " About five years ago , " she said . " Or was it six ? Around that . " <p> " How 'd they die ? " He sounded almost angry . <p> She shook her head . " I do n't remember that . A car accident , I think . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " You do n't even remember them dying ? " Paul set down his chopsticks and looked at her . " It 's traumatic stress , Nat , " he said . " You 're blocking these memories because of trauma . Do n't you want to know who you are ? " <p> " I do know who I am , " Natalie said . " I do n't need a bunch of memories of my family to define me . " <p> " No ? Then why wo n't you spend more than one night away from home ? " he said . <p> She looked at the broccoli and chicken on her plate and did n't reply right away . After a moment , she said , " I need my routine . It helps me keep things straight . " <p> " If it helps you so much , then why have n't you sold some of this junk off so you 'll have some room in here ? " he said . " Why , Natalie ? " <p> The heat rose in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so unexpected . She swallowed them back and said , " I  --  " <p> He waited . <p> " I  --  these things connect me to them , " she said . <p> " To your family ? " <p> She nodded , not understanding the source of his persistence nor of her own misery . <p> He hooked one leg around her chair and pulled it closer to his , catching her hand . When he spoke , his words were spaced , each one punching out of his mouth to make a point . " You are obsessed with your family . In spite of not even remembering them . It 's time you let go . If your memories are so traumatic that you 've completely blocked them  --  " <p> " There 's nothing wrong with me , " Natalie insisted . <p> He drew her into his lap and pulled the elastic band out of her hair , combing the curly mass with his fingers . " No , " he said softly . " Nothing 's wrong . You have me now . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She leaned her head against his shoulder , enjoying the faint limescented tang of his aftershave and the feel of his muscles under her cheek . <p> " I 've got a surprise for you , " he said , his voice suddenly light . <p> " What 's that ? " <p> " Here . " Leaning down , he fumbled with the zippered pocket on the outside of his overnight bag . He pulled out a brochure and handed it to her . <p> Natalie sat up and looked at it . It was for a cruise ship tour of the Mediterranean . " A cruise ? " <p> " Well , we 'd fly over , then board the ship . See ? We 'd cruise the Mediterranean and stop at classical sites . Three days Athens , and another two at Delphi . I thought  --  " <p> She turned toward him . " Classical sites ? " <p> " You know , " he said eagerly . " The Parthenon . Apollo 's temple at Delphi . See  --  there 's a list . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her , that warm smile that always delighted her . " I thought ... " He paused . " A honeymoon ? " <p> " Oh , " she said . Unfamiliar territory . The sense of vertigo was back , stronger than before . All her routines were shifting . She looked at the picture on the brochure : tumbled stones , white in hot sunlight . Would she be able to remember her own name there ? <p> " Do n't you want to marry me ? " he asked . " I know it 's fast ... " <p> " I just had n't thought about it , " she said . " Going away  --  it 's not something I do . " <p> He hugged her , stroking the nape of her neck . " I know . But you 'll see , once you quit worrying , it 'll be fine . Just the two of us , together , all the time . Everything 'll be wonderful then . " <p> That night they slept together in her Great-aunt Marjory 's four-poster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenuous she had : just that of a sweet-faced woman who looked a bit like Grandma , only younger , smoothing the sheets on this very bed . Natalie was glad that none of her other relatives would see her bringing Paul here ; Aunt Marjory looked kind and easy-going . Marjory would n't mind that Paul was here , in her bed . <p> Natalie found the glass bits in her pocket as she was getting undressed . She put them on the nightstand , the blue-green of the shards blending with its chintz-ruffled cover . Then she set the alarm for thirty minutes earlier than usual , so she and Paul would have plenty of time in the bathroom the next morning . Already her ways of doing things were starting to blur , the familiar becoming strange . <p> Paul had a queen-sized bed at his place , and Aunt Marjory 's bed was a double . Sleeping so close to him made her feel that their future was rushing toward her . It was as if the Earth had suddenly increased the speed of its rotation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marriage ... <p> Everything seemed disordered to her , as she lay there , listening to his breathing . Her brother 's car  --  what would the garage people say about it ? She could n't imagine living without that one image of him , after she 'd lost so much . Even his name . She closed her eyes and tried to summon the sound of his voice , the sun on his tanned arms , the mirror-bright finish of the freshly waxed car . But she could not , not without the feel of that finish beneath her fingertips . And Paul wanted her to take a trip to the other side of the world . Would she even remember them when she came back ? A single night away tended to blur things . Could she remember that they mattered if she were gone for three weeks ? <p> Once more she tried to summon her brother 's voice , and failed . Maybe if she touched the car ... <p> Natalie eased out of bed and went to the closet , stepping softly . Her T-shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamper . Leaving the light off , she pulled them on and threaded her way through the living room to the sliding glass door . Opening it made less noise than the front door would . <p> There was a breeze , but the night air felt as if it were skin-temperature . Summertime tepid . She picked her way across the grass and through the gate . The Mustang looked the color of old blood in the faint light of the streetlamp . The dark bright finish made her think of the violent encounter she had recalled for the first time earlier . For an instant she wavered . But she could n't remember her brother 's face . Or even his name . <p> She walked to the curb and touched the burnished fender of his car . It was indistinct , but she caught the glimmer of shining paint , the soft rhythm of his voice , pulled it to her , concentrated  --  <p> " Natalie , " Paul said sharply . <p> She flinched , and the faint image burst like a soap bubble . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to get hurt ? " He curled his fingers around her upper arm and tugged her away from the car , but she balked . <p> " Just  --  " Her reaching fingers made contact with the cat 's skin , just as he gave another tug , harder this time . One quick snapshot of a golden-haired man shoving someone against the fender , bones crunching  --  <p> She snatched her fingers away like a burned child , hesitated a second more , then let Paul lead her up the walk and inside . He tucked her under the bedcovers without speaking and went back to lock the doors . Within minutes of his return , he was asleep again . <p> Her motion sickness was stronger than ever . She turned against the pillows , restless with listening to the sounds of Paul 's breath and hearing only silence when she tried to invoke her brother 's voice . Her hands clenched as she strained for the memory . <p> Nothing . Then her fingers found the smooth dark wood of the bedpost . Marjory 's face came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept . <p> He was a tall man , tall and thin with long black hair , raggedly cut curls tangled around his bony face . His nose was long and sharp , but not as sharp as his gray eyes , which narrowed as he scrutinized her . He laughed , a harsh sound . <p> " Who are you , " she asked him , and he laughed again . <p> He whirled in front of her , and she saw his black leggings and soft boots , with the toes stuffed , one heel missing ; watched the loose sleeves of his chamois-colored shirt billow as he moved , watched the scarlet and purple and black ribbons tied at his elbows and wrists and knees dance sideways as his body turned . <p> He stopped , but even still , his body seemed to be in motion . Then he bowed , one hand over his heart in a display of mock courtesy . " Do you not remember me , Lady ? " he said , and his accent was odd , the words clipped and short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember you . " <p> The hand over his heart reached for her then . A large bony hand , with oversized , scarred knuckles and fingernails that were grimy and too long . That hand , reaching for her face , and Natalie suddenly knew that , if he touched her , he would take her mind . <p> She screamed . <p> THERE WERE hard fingers on her face , thumb and fingers embedding themselves in the flesh of her chin and cheek , and someone was shaking her . Natalie screamed again , the terror so enormous that it was unnameable ; impervious to words or her own thoughts . <p> And then the fingers released her face and lightly slapped her cheek . <p> " Wake up ! " It was Paul 's voice , not the strange man 's , Paul who was shaking her . " You had a bad dream , honey . Come on , wake up now ! " <p> She choked and gasped , as if she were surfacing after too long under water . Opening her eyes helped : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marjory 's bed eased her out of the torrent of fear . Then she saw the glitter of the glass bits from the shattered car window . <p> Paul collapsed against the pillows . Sweat beaded his upper lip . " Christ , you scared me . Are you okay ? " <p> " His hand  --  " Natalie gulped air and tried to calm herself . " There was a man , a stranger , but he knew me  --  he knew who I was , Paul ! And he tried to touch my face . " She curled up and pressed her face against her knees . " His hands  --  " Her voice broke . <p> Paul stroked her back lightly . " Shhh , " he whispered . " It 's okay , Nat , it was just a dream . " <p> " He seemed real . Like a real person , " she said . " Like someone I knew , but could n't remember . The  --  " She hesitated . " There 's a name for him . Not a person 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head . <p> He was rubbing a hand across his chest , dragging the pale brown hair one direction , then the other . " You were screaming something about ' the tinker . ' " <p> The word seeped into her like cold water . " The Tinker , " she repeated . " Oh , I do know him somehow , Paul ! And he knows who I am  --  " She turned toward him , and he put his arms around her . " What if it 's someone I do n't remember , who hates me ? " She shuddered . " He might be trying to kill me . Paul . He might be the one who shot my car . " <p> She was clutching at his chest . Paul flinched and drew her hands away from his body , then said , " It was just a dream , Natalie . It 'll be okay . " But he looked troubled . <p> " You do n't know that , " Natalie said . " Do n't you see ? He could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , and something in his face stopped her . " There 's no stranger out there with a gun . " <p> Her heart hammered a staccato cadence . " How do you know ? " <p> He slid one hand up her arm to cup her cheek , and this time Natalie did not flinch . She was too frightened . <p> " Trust me , honey . I know a lot about you , " Paul said . <p> Dread pressed against her throat . What did he know about her that she did n't know herself ? <p> " Do n't look at me like that ! " he said , curling his fingers along her cheek . The nail of his crooked finger scraped lightly over her skin . " It 's all going to be okay . As long as we 're together , just the two of us , everything 's going to be fine . " <p> He drew her against his chest and stroked her hair . <p> She woke to daylight dimmed by drawn blinds and stillness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hoped she would rest , he would tell the dean she had called in sick , he would see her tonight . <p> Missing her morning routine bothered her ; she set her alarm even on weekends so as not to disturb the rhythm of her day . So she got up , brushed her teeth and showered , put on her makeup and got dressed in jeans and a T-shirt . She was giving her hair its daily hundred strokes when the doorbell rang . <p> She had her hand on the knob , about to open the door when she hesitated . The silence of the complex outside was unnerving , here in the middle of a weekday . " Who 's there ? " <p> " Mary , your neighbor . Open up , would you ? This thing 's heavy . " <p> Natalie turned the deadbolt and blinked at the brilliant sunlight outside . Her eyes watered from the contrast , and at first she could n't make out what Mary was holding . Then her eyes adjusted , and she saw the bulky terra-cotta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hustled inside and set the pot on top of the blanket chest in the hallway . She scooted the pot sideways a little . It left a muddy trail on the oak surface of the chest , and Natalie 's hands twitched . <p> " Mmp . That 's better . " Mary turned to her , beaming . " This 'll help . I can see you need pro-tec-tion . " She rapped on the clay pot with one meaty knuckle , a faintly musical sound . " Rosemary , " she added . <p> Natalie said , " Who 's Rosemary ? " <p> Mary looked at her for a moment , then she laughed . " The plant rosemary . Good for lotsa things , but best for keeping your house safe . You wear a little too , any time you go out . " She twisted off a sprig and handed it to Natalie . " In your hair , maybe . " <p> " Oh . " The rosemary had a tangy sweet smell . She had n't put her hair up yet , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and obediently tucked the rosemary sprig into her ponytail . She came out to find Mary ensconced on the Queen 's chair . <p> " Pretty chair , " Mary said , stroking the gold brocade . " How come you got so much stuff ? " <p> Natalie sat on the Duncan Phyfe sofa . " It helps me remember my family , " she said . <p> " Oh , they die a long time ago , huh ? That 's hard , to lose your family . But you still got some people , somebody that took care of you , right ? " <p> Natalie shook her head . " They 're all dead . I was grown up when it happened though . " <p> Mary 's face lost its vivacity . " That 's bad , " she said . " Two of my brothers 're dead . Every day I think about them and pray . That 's how you do with your family too ? " <p> Natalie picked up the basket of bobbins and began smoothing the colored threads with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But I only remember little bits about them . Paul says there 's something wrong , me not being able to remember stuff . " <p> Mary tilted her head to one side and regarded Natalie closely . " Could be , " she said . " Seem to me like you need pro-tec-tion . That 's why I bring you the rosemary . Do you all kinda good . " <p> Natalie touched the striped satin on the arm of the sofa , running her fingers over the almost-invisible dam at the front edge . The image of her mother placing those small precise stitches was the only one that came to her . Her mother 's memory was in the Queen 's chair too . She reached over and touched the curved wooden arms , running her fingers lightly over the incised ball at the end . She could see her mother 's face more clearly in this memory ; she was looking up in this one , telling someone about the chair 's history . But there was no more to the memory this time than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rosemary , but I do n't remember any more than usual , " she said . <p> Mary shrugged . " Maybe it 'll help your remembering , maybe it 'll do something else , ca n't tell . But you keep on wearing it , you hear ? " <p> Natalie nodded and Mary heaved herself up from the chair . Natalie walked with her to the door and thanked her . <p> The brilliant sunlight outside ended abruptly at the front step , as if the house exerted a dimness that was too strong for daylight to overcome . <p> Mary squinted , looking across the lawn , then glanced back and said , " Your car 's gone . " <p> " Car ? " Natalie tried to think what She meant . <p> " Someone come and took it off this morning . Your boyfriend getting it fixed for you , maybe . " Mary turned and walked off . " ' Member what I say , " she called back . <p> Natalie nodded . " I 'm trying . " <p> THAT NIGHT Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbecue place near the office . " I thought you might not feel like cooking , " he said . He seemed to be watching her more closely than usual . " Thanks , " she said . " That 's thoughtful of you . " <p> She got paper plates from the cabinet and glasses for iced tea . <p> He leaned against the doorway from the dining room , pulling off his tie . " The mechanic called . He sure fell in love with that damn car of yours . " <p> " Hmm ? Natalie said . She filled the teakettle with water and put it on the stove . <p> " He was wild over what a classic it was . Sounded like he wanted to buy it , but I told him there was no way you 'd sell . You being so attached to it you have to go out and tuck it in at night . " <p> She got the tea bags from the pantry and took a pitcher from the cabinet . <p> " Right , Natalie ? " Paul said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He was watching her again . " You wo n't sell the car , because it belonged to your brother , is n't that right ? " <p> Her throat tightened , and she frowned . " What are you talking about , Paul ? I do n't have a brother . " The teakettle whistled and she poured hot water over the teabags . " This should be ready in just a sec . You want to set out the food ? " <p> He watched her narrowly for a moment more , then tossed his tie over the arm of the Queen 's chair and came to help . As they sat down to eat , he asked her , " You like living here , do n't you ? " <p> She put a spoon in the cole slaw . " What do you mean ? " <p> He glanced around the room . " Having to get by on just my salary does n't bother you , now that we 're married ? It 'll take a while for me to save up the money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Natalie had a spinning moment , dizzy with the image of the Tinker flashing into her mind . When had she and Paul gotten married ? And why did n't she remember it ? But he was watching her with that intent look on his face again . She leaned over and kissed his cheek . " Of course it does n't bother me . I love you , do n't I ? " <p> He lifted a hand as if to stroke her hair , but stopped abruptly . " What 's that in your hair ? It looks like a dead weed or something . " <p> " It 's rosemary , " she said . " One of the neighbors brought it to me . Superstition I guess , but she says it 'll keep me safe . " <p> " You do n't need that kind of foolishness . You 've got me to take care of you . " <p> She smiled at him . " I know that , Paul . " <p> He seemed preoccupied and distant during the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forgotten , who the Tinker was . She brushed Paul 's remoteness aside . <p> She dreamed again that night , blurred dreams of walking through a large old house with all its furnishings swagged in dust covers . The floorboards creaked under her feet as she walked , and dust swam around her in ghostly clouds . <p> In her dream , she was desperately looking for something she needed , but she could n't remember what it was . Frightened by the indistinct shapes of the furniture and the dim unfamiliar rooms , she continued to search , more and more urgently . <p> She went through room after room , searching , certain that if she saw the thing she would recognize it . Finding herself in a second-floor conservatory , it occurred to her that she had to lift up the dust cover of the large shape beside her and look underneath to find what she needed . <p> The idea was terrifying  --  the odd shape draped with cloth seemed menacing . But she heard the sound of voices from another room . People were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fear and she lifted one corner of the cover . <p> In the gloom , she could not at first make out what was underneath . <p> And then the shape moved , became recognizable : The Tinker lay under the cloth . <p> He opened his eyes , and she tried to drop the cover , but he caught her wrist and sat up . <p> " I remember you , " he said in that mocking way , and reached for her face with his other hand . " Do you remember me ? " <p> She woke from the nightmare in a cold sweat . Paul had the lights on and was kneeling next to the bed . He had flipped the ruffled cloth back from the nightstand , and was examining the piece of furniture underneath . She must have made some sound , because he turned his head and looked at her . <p> " This is an old radio , " he said . " One of the floor models , a tube set . " <p> She swallowed twice before she could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , please . I had a nightmare . " <p> He glanced at her , frowning , then looked back at the radio . " Does it work ? These are valuable nowadays . " <p> She cried , " Do n't ! " as he reached for the switch , but it was too late . The radio made a scratchy burp , and then it was there , the sound of a woman , weeping desolately . " No , " Natalie said , " turn it off ! " <p> Paul looked at her , confused . " What is this ? Tube radios have to warm up  --  " <p> The desperate crying ripped at her ; she nearly screamed herself . " Turn it off , turn it off , turn it  --  " <p> He twisted the tuning knob . The sound did n't alter , except that the sobbing rose in intensity . " Kinky , " he said . <p> Natalie had dragged the pillows up to her chest , crushing them close . "  --  off , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me touch it , please , Paul , turn it off . " <p> " Sure , " he said . He touched the controls again , and the sound stopped . <p> He was still staring at the set . " What 's with this thing , anyway ? " <p> " Cover it up , " Natalie said . " I do n't like to look at it . " <p> He glanced over at her . " Right , " he said . He got back in bed and cuddled her close to him . " Sorry you had a bad dream , " he whispered as he turned out the light . <p> Paul kissed her goodbye as he was leaving the next morning ; she came half-awake and listened to the sound of the bedroom door closing behind him . It was considerate of him to let her sleep in , but she would have liked to fix him breakfast . Something a good wife should do . Besides , she had to get up early ; it was a compulsion she did n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right away and dressed quickly , planning to go across to look for Mary . As she was dressing , she found some pieces of broken glass on the nightstand . Looking at them made her uneasy , so she threw them away . <p> The doorbell rang as she was tying her shoes . <p> It was her neighbor , the blond man . She could n't remember his name . " Oh , hi , " she said . <p> He looked upset . " Are you okay ? I saw that car pulling away again , and I thought  --  " <p> " What car ? " Natalie was trying to remember his name , and had n't he done her a favor of some kind ? What was it he 'd done ? <p> " I was sure it was the same car , you think you ca n't remember things , but then when you see them again , you recognize all the little things  --  it 's a dark blue Ford , kind of muddy , and I could n't read the license  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just Paul 's car . My boyfriend . No  --  I mean my husband . " <p> The neighbor went white . " Your husband ? God , I 'm sorry , I did n't know . I did n't even think you were married . Look , are you sure you 're okay ? He  --  " The man hesitated , then plunged on , " he did n't hurt you or anything , did he ? " <p> " No , " Natalie said , confused . " He spent the  --  he lives here . " She took a deep breath to steady herself , and said what she was certain of . " He just got up and kissed me goodbye . " <p> The man was watching her a little strangely now . " You just got back together ? Are n't you going to call the police ? " <p> " About what ? " she said , starting to get upset herself . " Because you saw my husband 's car outside ? " <p> He was shaking his head . " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mustang got shot up . " <p> " What are you talking about ? " Natalie said . There was a rushing sound in her ears , and she was feeling dizzy . <p> It took her a few seconds to realize that the neighbor was backing away , still shaking his head . " Never mind , " he said . " I 'm sorry I tried to get involved . Just forget it . " <p> She stood there in the doorway for a few moments after he left , trying to get her thoughts straight . Should she call the police ? What was she forgetting ? Her Mustang , he had said . Shots . Who could explain that to her ? <p> Then she brushed against the rosemary plant and remembered Mary . She pulled a sprig off the plant and put it in her hair , then drew the door shut behind her with shaking hands . Mary lived just across the street and down one , she could remember her saying that . <p> She went down the sidewalk , stepped around some broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The complex was swathed in early morning stillness , the air starting to warm up as the sun worked its way above the trees . She walked up the sidewalk of the unit opposite hers and looked at all the numbers , trying to remember which was the right one . Then she heard rapid footsteps on the sidewalk behind her and turned around . <p> It was Paul , his moth-pale hair flat and shiny in the sunlight . " Why are n't you at home ? " he said . <p> " I  --  " <p> " I forgot something and came back for it , " he said . " And when I went inside and you were gone ... " He came to her , enveloping her in his arms . " Come back inside . " <p> She went with him , oddly unsettled by his touch . Pausing in the entryway , she broke off a stem from the rosemary plant and twined it in her fingers . <p> " I 'm worried about you , Nat , " he said from the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should take you to the doctor . " He reached for her again , his crooked finger curved like a hook . <p> She backed up a step and knocked over the wire basket . The wooden bobbins went everywhere , a flash of brilliant color , some of the threads unwinding . Natalie knelt and gathered them up , then sat on the sofa with the bobbins in her lap . <p> Paul sat down beside her . " Why are you so nervous ? I 'm here , I 'll stay home today and take care of you . " He paused . " If you want me . You do , do n't you ? " <p> Quickly she said , " That 's okay . Really . I do n't even know what it is I want . " She looked down and busied herself with untangling the threads . The thick cotton was cool and smooth under her fingers . " I ca n't remember what I wanted , " she said . " In my dream . I knew I was looking for something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know what it was . But I knew I 'd recognize it if I found it . ' <p> " You want to remember ? " His voice was soft , still . Dangerous ? But why should she think that ? He was n't even touching her . <p> Natalie found herself twisting threads together with the rosemary , knotting and braiding them in a random pattern . " I  --  yes , I guess that 's it . I want to remember everything . It seems like I keep dropping things as I go along , losing them , and then I ca n't find them ever again . I want to find the things I 've lost . " <p> " You dreamed there was something you 'd lost ? That was all it was - your nightmare ? " He slid his hand across the stripes of the sofa cushion . His short neat fingernails made a faint ripping noise on the slick fabric . <p> " Well . " Natalie wove the threads through her fingers into a pattern of scarlet , purple , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , this big old house that seemed familiar . But I did n't know where I was really , and all the furniture was covered . But I knew I had to find something , so I lifted up one of the dust covers and  --  " <p> " Hidden memories , " he said . " Secrets . And they frighten you , do n't they , Natalie ? " <p> Her throat closed over any words she might have had . <p> " Well , " he said . " I should get back . Since you do n't want me . Walk me out , at least . " <p> Natalie 's fingers clenched on the threads she held , snapping them free of the bobbins . His hand was on her wrist , tugging at her , so she set the basket aside and stood . The braid of threads wound through her fingers ; she closed them around it and followed Paul . <p> Despite her unease , he went quickly , without even a kiss . Natalie watched the dark blue sedan pull away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . <p> Cloudshadow skimmed across the front lawn and was gone . The wind was picking up . Uncertain , she stood on the porch for a moment . Why had she never noticed before how much pecan trees moved ? The ones in the yard were pitching like boats , their striating shadow-patterns flashing over her so fast she felt seasick . <p> Had n't she , as a child , lain ill in some narrow sultry room and endured such a thing ? Flashes of refracted light rocking around her like water-dance on the walls , ceiling , floor , intensifying her nausea to the point where she felt she would die ? <p> She reached for the veranda post , needing its support , but it was n't there . No veranda , no azalea-masked railings , no smooth gray-painted boards underfoot . No flat smooth steps with cast-iron boot-scrapers embedded in their edges . The duplex had only an abbreviated overhang and three feet of cement to mark its entrance . <p> She looked toward the street , for an instant seeing large old oaks arched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the sun-hot pavement . <p> The image shimmered and was gone . There were only boxwoods by the street , green and square . From one , braided threads waved in the breeze , like a tiny bright flag , right in front of Natalie 's unit . She looked down at her hand . Empty . When had she tied the braid to the bush ? And why did n't she remember doing it ? <p> The phone rang inside , its shrillness muffled but compelling . She answered on the third ring . A man whose voice she did n't recognize said , " Miss Emerson ? " <p> " Yes ? " she said . <p> " This is Officer Herrera of the police department , " the man said . " I responded to a shooting incident a few days ago ? " <p> Natalie gripped the phone and said , " Yes ? " A shooting incident ? Her neighbor had said something about shots , cars  --  <p> That whooshing sound was back in her ears , making it hard for her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballistic match , " he was saying . " Do n't want to alarm you , but it 's possible it was the same weapon used in a mass killing a few years back . Did you ever know a family called Ericson ? " <p> Her lungs hauled in air , and she listened to the beating of her heart . " I do n't think so , " she said . " That is , I do n't remember anyone by that name . " <p> She heard him sigh . " I did n't think you would , and there 's probably no connection . It might not even be the same gun , or it might have been stolen or sold . But the entire Ericson family was killed , and the case was never solved . So if you remember anything , you will call us immediately ? " <p> " Yes , of course , " she said . He thanked her and hung up before she could explain how unlikely it was that she would remember . Shots . A car , <p> a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car last night ? <p> She had to do something . <p> But what ? <p> Natalie found herself searching through the house , almost as she had in her dream the night before , moving from one piece of furniture to the next , touching each one . The sofa 's image of her mother seemed blurred and faded , like a scratchy old photograph , just a foggy image of a dark-haired woman bent over her needlework . The piano 's keys did not give her any images at all , now , nor did the Queen 's chair . <p> She strained for recall , trying to touch the pieces with her-mind as well as her flesh . Sweat came on her chest , along her spine , as she reached , grasping for the elusive memories . She knew they were in there , knew it , if she could only stretch a little further  --  <p> It did no good . <p> The dining table  --  it had always held a vivid picture for her  --  she went to it , letting her fingers follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . And the usual image was there : the table standing on a polished wood floor , set with a crocheted tablecloth . There was something else to the memory , Natalie could feel it , fuzzy , at the edges of her perception , but could not drag it out into the center of her mind . <p> She sat there under the table , one hand stroking its mahogany claw , until she fell asleep . <p> Waking was a groggy thing for her this time , a gradual process of adding referents until she knew where she was . A fringe hung down in front of her , and she touched it , only moments later recognizing the Persian shawl that usually hung beside the piano . <p> " Boo , " said a deep , familiar voice in her ear . <p> She jerked upright and rammed her head against the underside of the table . The force of the blow made her eyes water and her head spin , but she scrambled out from underneath anyway , dragging the shawl away with her . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand , immediately behind where she had been . Seeing him there , knowing how close she had been to him made her stomach lurch . <p> " Who  --  " <p> " Do n't remember me , do you ? " he said , and his voice was as she had dreamed it , nasal and clipped . He smiled at her , revealing teeth as large and yellowed as a horse 's , and added , " I remember you . " <p> " You  --  you 're the Tinker , " she said . Each breath was hard to capture , as if the air in the room were eluding her lungs . <p> He rolled out from under the table and vaulted to his feet , his movements as controlled and effortless as an acrobat 's . He was a head and a half taller than she , and she could smell him , a strange dark smell like loam and rotting leaves . " Ah , so you do remember something then . But you 've got my name wrong , I 'm afraid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shorter than ever ; he was close enough to touch her . She made two slow steps back , never taking her eyes from him . <p> His taunting grin flickered , and he bowed the extravagant gesture she remembered from her dream , one hand sweeping wide and then covering his heart . " The Tinkerer , " he said . <p> " What do you want ? " <p> His brows shot up . " What do you want , Natalie ? " He unfolded the large grimy fingers of his hand and dangled the braided twist of threads she had made in front of her . " You sent for me . " <p> " No ! " she said . " That 's  --  if it 's a signal , it was an accident . I do n't want you here . " <p> " No ? " he said , his brows raised again : " But you said , ' I want to remember everything . It seems like I keep dropping things as I go along losing them , and then I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things I 've lost . ' " He repeated her every inflection , the very rhythm of her voice . <p> " How do you know what I said ? " she asked . " Why are you here ? " <p> He wound the braided threads around one finger ; they disappeared , and he was holding a rosemary sprig instead . " Because you said you wanted to find the things you 've lost . " He whirled , and she jumped back , knocking against the butler 's table . <p> But he only reached back under the dining table , behind the clawed feet , and drew out a battered wooden chest about the size of an orange crate . He twisted a carved knob on the front and opened the top , releasing a flutter of sparkling dust motes that drifted lazily to the ceiling and lighted there . <p> The Tinkerer thrust his arms into the chest , and she heard odd sounds , like scraps of music or talk , quickly cut off . The muscles of his back flexed , she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied at his elbows rippled scarlet and purple as his arms worked . <p> " Ah , " he said after a few minutes , sitting back on his heels . " I knew I had it here somewhere . " He bounced to his feet and turned toward her , holding a miniature dollhouse perhaps a foot and a half tall . <p> The details of the Victorian house were perfect : tiny weathered cedar shakes on the roof and sides , porch steps that sagged slightly in the center , the veranda floor painted gray and the railings white . Even the delicate multi-paned windows were glassed . <p> " Here we are , then , " he said , setting the house down . <p> Captivated , she knelt beside it , peering in the windows . A flash of memory  --  chandeliers in high-ceilinged rooms , dim and cool against the onslaught of summer afternoons , floor fans humming like large benign insects , the pulse-splat of sprinklers and scent of water drifting through open windows . " There were oak trees here , " she whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , around the veranda . " <p> " Where d' you want to start ? How about with that table you 've knocked about ? " <p> " The table ? " Natalie dragged her gaze away from the house and looked at the butler 's table next to her . The removable tray-top was askew . <p> The Tinkerer made an irritated sound . " You want to remember everything . You have decided , have n't you ? Let 's get on with it then . " <p> Natalie hesitated . He frightened her . But the images of her dream came back to her : the desperate search through half-familiar rooms , in a house that looked much like the model resting on her carpet . With the memory came the sharp fresh longing to find the precious thing she had lost , lost beyond any ability to recall . <p> She had to do whatever it took to remember . <p> " What do I do ? " she asked him . <p> " Sit there , " he replied , " and put your hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , that 's good , and , here , let me guide your other hand  --  " <p> She flinched when she felt his callused fingertips on her wrist , but he tightened his grasp and drew her hand to the miniature shingles on the dollhouse . <p> In the background of her mind , she had been aware of the memory connected with the butler 's table : a doll 's tea party , tiny white porcelain saucers and cups , really no more than a snapshot of a tow-headed boy of about seven balancing one saucer on a finger and laughing . As the Tinkerer placed her hand on the house , though , the image intensified , clarified , colors draining into it the way water fills an empty bag , and she saw the boy move , spinning the saucer , the saucer beginning to drop  --  <p> The image was gone . She could feel it , somewhere inside her head , but it was whirling too fast for her to touch it . Natalie opened her eyes . <p> The Tinkerer was smiling at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that was n't so bad , was it ? " He picked up a miniature butler 's table , perfectly crafted , and set it inside the house . <p> The real butler 's table was gone . " How will I remember , if you take that ? " she said . " I have to touch things to remember . " <p> " Not anymore , " he said . " The memory is there . It 's probably still circling around , looking for a place to land , but it 'll settle down in a day or so . " <p> " But you 're taking the table , " she said . " How will I know if you 're lying to me ? I 'll forget all about it . " <p> He laughed . " Brains all scrambled , are they ? Happens when you mess about with your memories too often . Well . Here . " He reached into the box behind him and brought out a handful of marbles . He cupped them next to his chest and examined them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box . Then , balancing the marble on his finger , he gave it a twirl , setting it spinning . She watched it  --  it was a swirlie with blue and red ribbons inside  --  and his hand reached for her face . <p> " Do n't touch me ! " she said , jerking back . <p> " Do n't fret . I 'm just going to settle the memory , " he said . " Watch the marble . " He touched her cheek with his forefinger , his thumb curving around her chin . <p> Natalie watched the marble , instantly mesmerized by the spiraling colors , spinning , slowly spinning inside , around and around ... <p> . . . and she was watching her brother Tom , the image faintly scratchy , like a piece of old film , but it was Tom , spinning a saucer from her doll 's tea-set on his fingertip , his white-blonde hair , so like their father 's , gleaming in the sun that slanted through the blinds of her mother 's parlor . ... <p> Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tinkerer pulled his hand away and snapped his fingers in front of her nose . " See ? " he said , flipping the marble over his shoulder . She heard it land inside the wooden box and roll . " They 'll all settle out like that in a few days . What next ? How about that chair ? " <p> It was the Queen 's chair , which surrendered layered recollections of her mother , telling stories of her girlhood , sitting in the chair and reading to Natalie and Tom . . . and then it was the big mahogany table , a snarled tangle of Thanksgivings and Christmases , games of canasta and checkers , shaded afternoons spent sipping minted tea and glittering evenings with candlelight gleaming on cut crystal and polished silver . <p> The sofa , the ugly telephone stand , the Victorian loveseat , the Persian shawl  --  a wealth of remembrance stored in each one , faces , names , her father 's laugh , her brother 's chipped front tooth , her grandmother 's passion for silk dresses , were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood and fabric , horsehair and batting . <p> It was wealth , wonder ; more solid joy than she could ever remember feeling . The memories filled her up , made her substantial and connected her to the ground . She felt real . <p> The straight chair  --  the desk  --  the Tiffany lamp , she relinquished them all , happily . They were only things , and things could be lost or broken . But the memories they carried would last . She could keep them always . <p> The apartment had grown dim as she transferred the pieces , exchanging them for the gratifying weight of remembrance , what next , what next ? <p> " The dishes ? " she asked him . " Are there memories there ? I want to remember more . " <p> " I deal only in furnishings , " he said , glancing about . " You 'll remember more soon , you know . Perhaps too much . Although I can not give you back memories you 've lost track of , " he said . " Only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still have some connection with . " <p> " Losing track of things , yes . I 've done that , I know . Oh , but the piano ! " Natalie said . " I 'm forgetting the piano . " <p> He paused . " There is the matter of my fee , " he said . <p> " Your  --  fee ? " she faltered . <p> He gave her a wicked wink . " The piano , " he said . <p> " I see , " she said . " You 'll just take it ? Not give me its memories ? " He nodded . <p> She went to the piano , stroked the rosewood cover and lifted it , fingered the keys . What memories were locked inside here ? Small hands struggling to reach an octave , guided by larger hands , veined and wrinkled , but very gentle ? What was inside that she would never see ? <p> She turned away . " That 's all right , " she told him . " It 's worth it . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wire basket of bobbins on the rug , lit only by the dim bulb of a modern floor lamp . " I remember so much ! I 'm someone else , now ! " <p> She had n't been watching closely ; he had a tiny piano in his hand . He admired it for a moment , then tucked it into the house . " Just a few more items , and I 'll be done here . " <p> She glanced around . " Nothing 's left . " <p> " The carpet , " he said . He pulled a scrap of yellow paper from his sleeve and read , " A mahogany buffet , a cedar chest . A pie safe . A ' 67 Mustang . A tube radio . " He smiled his horsey smile . " I keep an inventory . " <p> " The radio ? Carpet ? " she said . " I do n't like them , they make me feel  --  they give me bad feelings . I do n't want to swap them . And I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them anymore . " Her hands were cold and quivery ; she rubbed them together . <p> He shrugged . " Well then . Nothing to be done about those , lost and gone forever , oh my darling . But the carpet and the radio are here ; let 's finish up . I 've got to be going . " <p> " Just take them , " she said . " I do n't want the memories , I do n't like how they feel . " <p> " Part of the bargain , " he said . " It 's all or nothing . That 's the rule . " She bit her lip , denting it hard with her teeth . She always avoided even thinking about the radio , her mind veered off and she had to wrestle it back . Considering it , its dark face , the crackle of the tubes heating , the awful desolate sound in her head when she touched it  --  <p> " Make up your mind , " the Tinkerer said . " I 've business to conduct elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . <p> He shrugged . " I can put all this stuff back . " His yellowed teeth showed . " I 'll have that dining table for my fee this time , I think . You know , though , much more of this scrambling things about and your rememberer wo n't work at all . " <p> Okay , she thought . All or nothing , and I ca n't live with nothing . Not anymore . " Rules of the game , " she said aloud . She thrust one hand at him and thrust the other into the thick wool pile of the rug . " Do it then . " <p> But he took her wrist , slowly , as if suddenly reluctant . Perhaps he 'd grown tired . There was a crackling feeling under her fingers , as if of static , the breathless tingling instant before the spark strikes  --  <p> And then the memories were thick and red around her , sounds and images she could not decipher at first : frenzied movement , people around her running , falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming  --  her mother 's voice  --  and she clawed at him , trying to reach her mother and was frozen by the shocking pain of a blow to the head - and a hand was cupping her cheek , its little finger curved and clawlike against her skin , a voice that whispered to her about just the two of them now , so much better , just the two  --  until her vision blurred and the sounds dimmed , until all she knew was the coppery taste in her mouth and the sticky heat that soaked the rug beneath her reaching hand . ... <p> As the memory expelled her , her head whirled , aching at the crown as if she 'd been struck . " What was that ? " she cried out , " What happened ? I could n't see  --  ca n't remember enough  --  " She tried to pull herself back into the memory , to understand , but it was like trying to touch a spinning knife-blade ; razor-sharp colors and sounds sliced at her , and she could not grasp them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she caught his shirt , ignoring the smear of bloody fingerprints she left there . " Fix it ! I have to remember now , you have to help , " she said . <p> The Tinkerer jerked away from her , his mobile lips drawn back from his teeth in a half-snarl . " Not my job , " he said . " Let 's get the other over with . " He grabbed her arm and tugged her into the bedroom . <p> She wrenched loose , but followed him , the spark of razored colors blurring her vision , making her head ache . The bedroom was stuffy and dim . " The bed 's not on your list ? " she said . " It has memories in it . " <p> He glanced at the four-poster . " Not my work , " he said . " It 's just a piece of furniture . This , now , " he flipped the ruffled cloth off the radio , knocking the lamp and table clock onto the carpeting with a thud . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engulfed in dread , unable to speak . <p> The Tinkerer grasped her hand , and darkness closed around her  --  pain like frozen night stabbing her lungs and throat so she could scarcely bear to breathe , the sound of desperate sobs in her ears . The rasp of painful breathing was loud , her own , sounding both in her ears and inside her head . Blackness . Despair . Guilt . It went on and on , an unending cycle of misery , the darkness and the sobbing , until her chest and eyes burned with agony . And then , slowly , the memory settled , and she remembered . A clear image , this one , a recent vintage , not clouded or fuzzy . She remembered herself , pulling the Tinkerer 's hand to her face , saying , " Take them away . I ca n't stand to remember it anymore . Please , I 'm begging you , take them all . " <p> Slowly , painfully , an exhausted swimmer reaching shore , she dragged herself free of the cycling loop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle . She lay on the fourposter , her cheek resting in spreading dampness on the quilted spread , the faint tick of a clock like a counterpoint to her breathing , the sound of it in the apartment 's stillness a declaration that she was alone . <p> Sitting up , she saw the clock on the floor where the Tinkerer had spilled it . Four o'clock . Paul would be back soon . It took her several minutes to find a notepad , but there was one in a kitchen drawer . She made her list carefully , instructions to herself . She knew now , and would not let herself forget again . No more . Next time , she would know what to do . <p> Already memories pulled at her , dark and red , remembrance of the living and the dead . Natalie wiped her palms against her jeans and went to the phone . Her eyes blurred with unshed tears , but her hands were steady as she dialed the police station and asked for Officer Herrera . <p> ILLUSTRATION : " This your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By Susan Wade <p> Susan Wade 's fiction last appeared in our July 1995 issue .
