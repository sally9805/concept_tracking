txt SO Tim American Art Museum Morgans , the Rockefellers , the Whitneys , and the Sulzbergcrs have held positions on the Met 's board , often from one generation to another . Wealthy hoard members generally dominate today in the major American art museums , having replaced the nineteenth-century model which included artists and intellectuals whose careers did not generate large incomes . There arc no artists or art historians or professional art scholars on the board of the Metropolitan Museum today . " Increasingly " comments William Rubin , director emeritus of the painting and sculpture department at the Museum of Modern Art , " people arc being put on museum boards because of their financial clout " ( Rubin , 1984 : 129 ) . One reason why the American art museum has continued to move toward the wealthy board membership is the always growing need for financial support from the private sector . A comparative look at the income sources of arts institutions in Europe , for example , reveals that while museums in Italy and France are totally supported by the government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their income from the government , museums in the United States are likely to rely on government support for only 15 percent of their budgets and on earned and private income for 85 percent . Wealthy board members can assist with that 85 percent . A 1994 survey conducted by The National Center for Nonprofit Boards revealed that board members of arts and culture organizations were " most likely " to have made a personal financial contribution to their organization ( 80 percent ) and further , that the organization was most likely to require a contribution ( 59 percent ) . The survey also reported that 73 percent of the boards of arts and cultural organizations with annual revenue at $10 million or more were male and that 75 percent of the board members were selected by current board members ( Slesinger and Moyers , 1995 : 9-12 ) , a condition actually recommended by the American Association of Museums . The museum is no longer a quaint and quiet repository . It is a complex business operation with a board likely to be composed of businessmen who are accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables like those of corporations . So we have the situation being perpetuated by the board members in power , and necessitated by the museum 's financial needs , and perhaps further guaranteed by the development of a bureaucratic structure . In general , American art museums tend to follow the Morgan board member profile . The American Association of Museums ' publication Museum Trusteeship by Alan D. Ullberg recommends that the primary criteria for trusteeship be " an individual 's sense of social responsibility and his desire and ability to render service to the museum " ( Ullberg , 1981 : 36 ) . The trustee 's " ability " these days may be directly related to his bank account . When , in February , 1996 , the Museum of Modern Art announced the purchase of a hotel and two " brownstones " adjacent to the Museum on 53rd Street , in a $50 million transaction , Glenn D. Lowry , // the Modern 's director , said the money carne from a small group of trustees who wished to remain anonymous ( Vogel , 1996 : 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board appointments that , " yielding to both public criticism and the need for government aid , have elected to membership a handful of blacks , ethnics ' , and community leaders " ( Meyer , 1979 : 225 ) , this attempt at democratization rarely carries any impact in the major art museums . The second legacy of J. P. Morgan concerns the acquisition of masterpieces for the museum . Calvin Tomkins , in his book Merchants and Masterpieces , contends that when J. P. Morgan assumed the presidency of the Metropolitan , the concept of the museum underwent a fundamental change . No longer would the Metropolitan defer to European institutions , or limit itself to the utilitarian and educational ... casts , reproductions , and second rate works of art might still retain some usefulness for artisans and students , but the emphasis had shifted unmistakably to the great and original masterpieces , the treasures that old Europe proved only too willing , after all , to relinquish . ( Tomkins , 1989 : 99 ) With J. P. Morgan the purchase of art took on an excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan turned his energy to art , the concept of collecting changed from something persnickety to something powerful , and the collector from someone dainty and refined to someone influential and fascinating . The American art museum has become a superlative collecting machine . There is not at this moment any historical parallel for what has been achieved . One person who has understood and articulated this passion for acquisition is former Metropolitan Museum director , Thomas Hoving ( see also " Thomas Hoving and the corporate ? museum partnership " , Chapter 7 ) . Hoving , who served as director of the Metropolitan Museum from 1967 until 1977 , was known for his ability to capture not only masterpieces , but also the public 's imagination . " The chase and the capture of a great work of art is one of the most exciting endeavors in life , " he wrote , " as dramatic , emotional , and fulfilling as a love affair " ( Hoving , 1975 : 1 ) . Hoving also demonstrated an aggressiveness that may very well be part of the Morgan legacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Morgan-type trustee and the kind of director he might seek to head the museum . Relating the events leading to the Metropolitan 's acquisition in 1970 of the Velazquez painting Juan de Pareja , Hoving describes the special session of the Acquisitions Committee where approval of funds was to take place . Coming up at auction , it was estimated that the painting would fetch $5.2 million , a sum Hoving found " beyond comprehension . " " It took us a day to get used to the idea . Where , in God 's name , would all that money come from ? Even borrowing from both restricted purchase funds would he insufficient . " According to I loving , part of the solution would be found in the Acquisitions Committee : Charles Wrightsntan pledged $200,00 ( of his own funds ; Arthur Houghton pledged $100,0(X) ; Andre Meyer pledged $100,000 ; Joan Payson pledged $200,000 ; Brooke Astor ? " I am a poor little girl , so forgive Inc if I pledge only fifty thousand dollars , " and Douglas Dillon pledged $100,000 for a total of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of minutes ( Hoving , 1993 : 264-6 ) . This business of elite boards and the acquisition of masterworks may be quite undemocratic . The Morgans who served on boards and set this course for America 's art museums did not necessarily give consideration to the role of democracy in the art museum ; rather , they made autocratic decisions which resulted in procedures still followed today . These procedures became in time traditions which were adopted throughout the country , throughout the century , simply , because they worked . One person might call this American pragmatism ; another might attribute it to capitalist know-how . The motivations and continuations of these " traditions " will be explored in Chapter 7 when we examine more closely the impact of capitalism on the American art museum . The original mission of the Metropolitan and the Boston Museum of fostering pride and prestige in American society , of moral betterment and education for all , that mission , as defined in 1870 , continues to be pursued in diversified ways as is fitting to the ever-changing American democratic culture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America 's first museums were based on the Louvre , they were founded and administered by private citizens with private dollars . American artists debated the European aristocratic ideals of connoisseurship even while American patrons poured millions of dollars into acquisitions . Those same patrons hired the great architects of the day to fashion palaces to house those treasures . And while curators celebrated the rare , the enigmatic , the profound object , educators dreamed of making the American art museum truly accessible to the general public . America 's first museums set the paradoxical stage for all to follow . 4 The role of the federal government : The National Gallery , Washington , D.C. , and The National Endowment for the Arts Introduction In examining the impact of democracy on America 's art museums , that is , looking at the conflicts which naturally arise when an elitist activity is set down in the people 's park , one area that can be revealing is that of federally funded art museums . One can be sure that where there is money awarded , there is influence exercised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States of America , the influence may very well reflect democratic concerns . The national museums are gathered under the umbrella of the Smithsonian Institution , which is funded by federal dollars . The federal government , by an act of Congress in 1965 , created a federal agency for the dispersal of federal funds to independent art museums and other nonprofit art institutions , that is the National Endowment for the Arts . We will consider these two government institutions , their policies , practices , and influences , beginning with an overview of the Smithsonian , and focusing on the National Gallery as the major art museum within that structure . The National Gallery 's record of acquisitions and exhibitions will be analyzed . The record of the National Endowment , established to " foster the arts and to broaden their availability , " and the influence of the Congress on the Endowment will then be examined . The Smithsonian umbrella The Smithsonian Institution administers thirteen museums and galleries , the National Zoological Park , and a number of research facilities around the United Sates and in Panama . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York exhibits architecture , design , and the decorative arts . The other nine institutions arc located in Washington , D.C. ; the Arthur M. Sacklcr Gallery and the Freer Gallery specialize in Asian and Near-Eastern art ; the Anacostia Museum and the National Museum of African Art specialize in black culture and African art ; the American museums include the National Portrait Gallery , the National Museum of American Art and the Renwick Gallery ( American crafts ) ; the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden exhibits nineteenth- and twentieth-century sculpture and painting ; and finally , the National Gallery of Art , a collection of American and European paintings , sculpture , and the graphic arts , which will be the focus of this study . The Smithsonian Institution is the world 's largest museum complex and is primarily funded by the federal government . The Smithsonian was founded by an act of Congress in 1846 with a bill officially designating a National Cabinet of Curiosities and the Smithsonian Museum , a marriage which would result in the National Museum of the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the generous gift designated to be used for " the increase and diffusion of knowledge , " a vague directive to be sure ( Goode , 1901 : 93 ) . In 1835 , it became known that the Englishman James Smithson , who had died six years earlier in Genoa , had bequeathed his whole estate to the United States of America " to found at Washington , under the name of the Smithsonian Institution , an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men . " This information was given to the Congress of the United States by the then President Van Buren in December and the gift was accepted through an act of Congress in July , 1836 . In 1842 , following numerous proposals and long debates , Congress approved an act to incorporate the National Institution to " promote science and the useful arts " and to entrust the entire management of the Smithsonian fund to the National Institution ( Senate Bill , No. 245 , Twenty-sixth Congress , 1839-41 , Section No.4 ) . The two institutions would occupy buildings erected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collections of art and natural history owned by the United States would be deposited in these buildings . In this act is the germ of the National Museum idea including a proposition for an appropriation from the National Treasury to pay for those things not covered by the Smithson fund ( Goode , 1901 : 98 ) . Then , by 1846 , it was resolved by the Smithsonian Regents that it is the intention of the act of Congress and in accordance with the design of Mr. Smithson , as expressed in his will , that one of the principal modes of executing the act and the trust is the accumulation of collections of specimens and objects of natural history and of elegant art , and the gradual formation of a library of valuable works pertaining to all departments of human knowledge , to the end that a copious storehouse of materials of science , literature , and art , may be provided , which shall excite and diffuse the love of learning among men , and shall assist the original investigations and efforts of those who may devote themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Quoted in Goode , 1901 : 144 ) This " copious storehouse " which , by the terms of this charter , the Smithsonian Regents were requested to erect and pay for , was then filled with the national collections , and the care of those collections was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution . None of this was reached by way of a smooth road , and the power of the Smithsonian Regents would continue to be questioned and tested by Congress for years to come . This is important to mention since the role of Congress in such matters can change the role of the art museum in the American culture and the relationship established between the Congress and the Smithsonian impacts on the government 's role with all museums . ( The relationship between the Congress and the Smithsonian Regents in the 1840s and 1850s might be compared to the dilemma of the National Endowment for the Arts in the late 1980s and 1990s which will be addressed later . ) Congressional members did continue to interfere with the authority of the Board of Regents , suggesting how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobbying for the bulk of the income to be devoted to a library ; endeavoring to overthrow what had been established and substitute a Washington University ; and returning the entire Smithson legacy to England to be given to anyone who could legally take it ( Goode , 1901 : 145-47 ) . The Regents boldly asserted through Senator Jefferson Davis that it was " improper for Congress to interfere with the administration of a fund which it has confided to a Board of Regents not entirely formed of members of Congress and not responsible to it " ( Davis , quoted in Goode , p. 146 ) . The conflict culminated in 1856 with a Congressional investigation . The Smithsonian Board of Regents was successful in maintaining the position that they were not amenable to the advice or instructions of Congress and were the only authorities qualified to interpret the act of incorporation and the intentions of James Smithson ( p. 147 ) . The various art museums and galleries referred to earlier are considered units or bureaus of the Smithsonian Institution , and most were adopted during this century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooper-Hewitt Museum , for example , was administered by the Cooper Union until 1968 and is housed in the Carnegie Mansion in New York City . The Freer Gallery was a gift of Charles Long Freer ( 1856-1919 ) , and the Hirshhorn Museum was donated by the American financier John H. Hirshhorn ( 1899-1981 ) . For the purpose of understanding the place of a government-funded art museum among all the art museums in America , the focus here will be on the National Gallery of Art , the gift made to the American people in the middle of the twentieth century by Andrew W. Mellon . The National Gallery Andrew W. Mellon ( 1855-1937 ) was a financier , an industrialist , a statesman , and a collector of fine art . 1 le began his career in his father 's banking firm in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , and later became president of the Mellon National Bank . He was involved in several industries , including coal , iron , steel , and oil , and was director of many industrial and financial corporations . Mellon arrived in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Warren Harding 's Cabinet . He stayed to serve in this position for President Calvin Coolidge and President Herbert Hoover . It was during this period that the art collection Mellon had begun in Pittsburgh , under the guidance of a young Henry Clay Frick , would grow to become the nucleus of a national collection ( Walker , 1984 : 23 ) . With the assistance of the art dealer C. R. Henschel of M. Knoedler and Company , Mellon acquired Botticelli 's Adoration of the Magi , Jan Van Eyck 's Annunciation , Perugino 's Crucifixion , Raphael 's Alba Madonna and his St. George and the Dragon , Titian 's Venus with a Mirror , Velazquez ' study for his portrait of Pope Innocent X , and several paintings by Rembrandt , Van Dyck , and Frans Hals ( Finley , 1973 ; Kopper , 1991 ) . He purchased the famed Dreyfus Collection of Renaissance sculpture in 1936 , which included works by Donatello and Verrocchio , and a number of Renaissance paintings , including works by Antonello da Messina , Lippo Memmi , Pisanello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . It was clear that Andrew Mellon was building a collection of master works and that his vision of a national art museum was influenced by the great museums of Europe : the Louvre Museum and the National Gallery in London . One problem , as Mellon saw it , was that America 's National Gallery of Art at this point consisted of a collection that could not measure up to his standards . Mellon did not want his collection associated with the inferior works in the National Gallery . What he wanted from that institution was its name . The Regents of the Smithsonian Institution therefore agreed that the existing National Gallery of Art would henceforth be known as " The National Collection of Fine Arts " and the Andrew Mellon Collection would be called the " National Gallery of Art . " On December 22 , 1936 , Andrew Mellon made his offer to the President of the United States , Franklin D. Roosevelt . Over a period of many years I have been acquiring important and rare paintings and sculpture with the idea that ultimately they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be made available to them in a national art gallery to be maintained in the city of Washington for the purpose of encouraging and developing a study of the fine arts . Mellon goes on to explain that a Board of Trustees has been formed to carry out this purpose and that this Board has full power and authority to tired these works to a national gallery . In addition , these trustees have been given " securities ample to erect a gallery building of sufficient sirs to house these works of art and to permit the indefinite growth of the collection under a conservative policy regulating acquisitions . " Other regulations , restrictions , and conditions were also put in place . The letter discusses the architect Mellon employed ( John Russell Pope of New York ) , the location of the gallery ( the desired site had been promised as a George Washington memorial and excavations had begun , but funds were insufficient and Mellon was able to convince the Washington Memorial Association to evacuate the site ) , and the additional gift of an endowment fund , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( director and curators ) and to provide funds for future acquisitions . It is stated that future acquisitions be limited to " objects of the highest standard of quality , so that the collections to be housed in the proposed building shall not be marred by the introduction of art that is not the best of its type . " Mellon goes on to propose that the administration of the gallery be managed by a separate board of trustees and that they be empowered to make bylaws and regulations governing its operations . This request , along with the others , was granted , so that , although the National Gallery is in fact an integral part of the Smithsonian Institution , it is administered by a separate board of trustees patterned after a private corporation . " If this plan meets with your approval , " the letter continues , " I will submit a formal offer of gift stating specifically the terms thereof , and the erection of the building may proceed immediately upon the acceptance of such offer and the passage of necessary legislation by Congress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " House Joint Resolution No. 217 . " It stated that the faith of the United States is pledged that , on the completion of the National Gallery of Art by the donor in accordance with the terms of this Act and the acquisition from the donor of the Collection of works of art , the United States will provide such funds as may be necessary for the upkeep of the National Gallery of Art and the administrative expenses and costs of operation thereof . The bill was passed by both houses with all the provisions Andrew Mellon desired , and signed into law by President Roosevelt on March 24 , 1937 . The National Gallery formally opened on the evening of March 17 , 1941 . By this time , two other important collections had been assimilated and a third collection was under negotiation . The first collection was that of Samuel H. Kress of New York . Kress had created a huge mercantile business and with the fortune gained thus was able to build a collection of paintings and sculpture of the Italian school from the thirteenth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Madonna and Child by Giotto and The Calling of caption Peter and Andrew by Duccio . There were also paintings by Fra Angelico , Filippo and Filippino Lippi , Piero di Cosimo , and Perugino . Well-known paintings by Raphael , Titian , Tintoretto , Tiepolo , and Giovanni Bellini were also part of the Kress Collection . ( Information on all collections is available in the National Gallery 's catalogue of the collection . ) Later , Samuel Kress would broaden the scope of the collection given to the National Gallery to include French , German , Flemish , and Spanish art . He purchased the French works first : a distinguished group of paintings by Fragonard , Poussin , Chardin , Boucher , and others . Following this he bought others in the French School , the most famous being Napoleon in His Study by Jacques Louis David . The German collection was developed next and included paintings by Holbein and Darer and the famous Small Crucifixion by Grunewald . The Flemish paintings included works by Peter Paul Rubens , Van Dyck , and Hieronymus Bosch 's Death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spanish paintings , paintings by Goya and Zurbaran and several canvases by El Greco , among them the Laocoon . Kress donated sculpture as well : groups of Italian Gothic and Renaissance , a group of 1,300 Renaissance bronzes , Hellenistic marbles , and important French works . When the National Gallery opened in 1941 it contained an exhibition of American paintings donated by Chester Dale . Chester Dale was also interested in French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings and The role of the federal government S9 assembled one of the most important collections of that genre , which he then donated to the National Gallery . The Chester Dale collection illustrates the development of French painting from David to C6zatine and includes works by Monet , Renoir , and Cassatt . With these paintings comes the introduction of modernist ideas to the National Gallery and the first twentieth-century paintings by modernists such as Picasso and Matisse . It is important to note that these paintings were recognized as master works and incorporated into the permanent collection at the very beginning . Modern art was also part of the Widener Collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1942 . The remarkable Dead Toreador by Manet hangs with paintings by Corot , Degas , Renoir , and other artists who signaled this major shift . The collection also contains fourteen Rembrandts , two Vermeers , and works by Raphael , Bellini , El Greco , Titian , and the great English artists , Reynolds , Gainsborough , Turner , and Constable . But what is noteworthy is the fact that the National Gallery , dedicated to " collecting , preserving , and exhibiting the finest works of art obtainable , " included modern art as part of its foundation . What will be considered now is the second part of the National Gallery 's mission : " to make those works of art known and enjoyed by the people of this country and , indeed , by people everywhere to whom , in the larger sense , these and all works of art belong . " ( Finley , 1973 : 180 ) . How is the National Gallery fulfilling its promise ? A comparison of acquisition records and exhibition records over a ten-year period , beginning in 1984 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was a major growth period for the National Gallery and included both the tenth anniversary of the East Building and the 50th anniversary of the Gallery , events that stimulated gift-giving . Acquisitions , exhibitions and public demands The National Gallery is an institution rich in the objects of Western culture , and its collections include paintings , sculpture , drawings and prints , photographs , and decorative arts . In any given year the total number of acquisitions , according to the annual reports , might range from 500 to 1,500 objects . The 50th anniversary year , 1991 , saw the collection increased by 2,444 acquisitions . At the heart of the National Gallery , however , is the painting collection ; and so , to facilitate our purposes , we will consider only the painting acquisitions and , later , painting exhibitions . In 1984 , the National Gallery acquired a total of sixteen paintings , ten of which were by twentieth-century artists , including the American abstract expressionists , Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner . ( All statistics are compiled from the National Gallery Annual Reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total number of painting acquisitions was fifteen , ten of which were twentieth-century and six of those being works by another member of the New York School , Mark Rothko . In 1986 , the National Gallery scored a major win as it was awarded 174 by the Mark Rothko Foundation . The gift would eventually total 285 paintings and works on paper and more than 500 additional reference and study works , as the Mark Rothko Foundation designated the National Gallery the chief repository of its collection . That same year other painting acquisitions totaled 52 , eighteen of which were twentieth-century , and twenty of which were late-nineteenth-century modern works . In 1987 , 50 of the 55 painting acquisitions were twentieth- century , with the New York School still dominating . That year saw a gain of fifteen paintings by Barnett Newman and fifteen paintings by Mark Rothko . In 1988 , eleven paintings were acquired and ten of them were of the twentieth century ( Figure 4.1 ) . In 1989 and 1990 , ten out of sixteen and five out of the ten paintings acquired were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1992 witnessed a tremendous growth in the permanent collection due in large part to the Gallery 's 50th anniversary celebration . The number of new acquisitions of twentieth-century art during this period was very high : 31 of the 49 acquisitions reported in 1991 and 44 of the 57 acquisitions reported in the 1992 Annual Report were of the twentieth-century . In addition , over the course of those two years , six modern paintings of the late nineteenth-century entered the collection . The Gallery mounted an exhibition of some of these acquisitions in 1991 . Almost 300 works of art from more than 220 donors were included in " Art for the Nation : Gifts in Honor of the 50th Anniversary of the National Gallery of Art . " A second exhibition of anniversary gifts was opened in May , 1992 . Some gifts involved private collections . The Dorothy and Herbert Vogel Collection of more than 2,000 contemporary paintings , drawings , and sculptures by more than 200 artists began to be transferred in 1992 to the National Gallery with an initial gift and partial purchase of 214 works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of the six paintings acquired were twentieth-century works . Certainly the availability of works of art explains in part the high percentage of twentieth-century acquisitions . There are simply more 6 // Jackson Pollock paintings in the marketplace than there arc works by Giotto . The point is , however , that the National Gallery is actively engaged in gathering the art of the twentieth-century , and since abstraction has been the dominant force of that art , it 's safe to assume the National Gallery is actively engaged in preserving abstract objects and ideas . The National Gallery is dedicated to " collecting , preserving , and exhibiting the finest works of art . " Works of art from the permanent collection are continuously on view and are supplemented by temporary exhibitions which are curated from the museum 's holdings and/or borrowed from other institutions . Let us now examine the exhibition program during this same period and compare it to the acquisition record . In order to maintain a consistency with the record of acquisitions , we will focus on exhibitions of painting and on exhibitions containing paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sculpture only will not be considered here . ( All information is compiled from the National Gallery Annual Reports ; see Figure 4.2 . ) In 1984 the National Gallery mounted fifteen special exhibitions , nine of which included paintings . Of the nine exhibitions containing paintings , three focused on the work of twentieth-century artists : " Mark Tobey : City Paintings ; " " Modigliani : An Anniversary Exhibition " ( the artist was born in 1884 , died in 1920 ) , which combined paintings , drawings , and sculpture ; and a major retrospective of the cubist painter Juan Gris ( 1887 ? 1920 ) . In 1985 , 25 exhibitions were launched , eight of which included painting exhibits . According to the report of the department of installation and design , " The Treasure Houses of Britain " was the largest and most complex exhibition ever mounted by the National Gallery . It occupied 35,000 square feet of the East Building , space traditionally given over to twentieth-century art . ( Selections from the twentieth-century collection were installed in the concourse . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art during this period . The 1986 schedule contained twelve exhibitions , eight of painting , one of which , " Seven American Masters , " was of twentieth-century art . In 1987 , two of the six painting exhibitions were composed of art of the twentieth-century : Henri Matisse and Andrew Wyeth . " Henri Matisse : the Early Years in Nice 1916 ? 1930 " contained 171 paintings ; " Andrew Wyeth : The Helga Pictures " presented 140 images in pencil , watercolor , and tempera of the artist 's neighbor , Helga Testorf . The eight painting exhibitions organized in 1988 included a show of paintings , pastels , and drawings by Georgia O'Keeffe and " The Flag Paintings of Childe Hassam . " The 1989 schedule of 21 special exhibitions included ten dedicated to paintings . Selections from the twentieth-century collection were installed in a celebration of the tenth anniversary of the East Building , the only exhibition of the year concerned with the art of the twentieth-century . Of the fifteen painting exhibitions held in 1990 , two involved twentieth-century artists : " Matisse in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " Kazimir Malevich , 1878-1935 . " But in 1991 , none of the five painting exhibits concerned recent art . The 1992 schedule included a one-month show of work by the contemporary figure painter , Alice Neel , and a show of paintings , drawings , and prints by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner ( 1880-1938 ) . There was a total of fifteen exhibitions , and the principal undertaking was " Circa 1492 : Art in the Age of Exploration , " in celebration of the Columbus Quincentennial . This complex exhibition looked at the world cultures of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries through more than 600 objects from 33 countries . // Of the fourteen special exhibitions in 1993 , right included paintings and one focused on a contemporary artist : " Ellsworth Kelly : The Years in France . " The blockbuster of the year was a painting show : " Great French Paintings from the Barnes Foundation : Impressionist , Post-Impressionist , and Early Modern , " which featured 80 works by Renoir , Cezanne , Monet , Van Gogh , and others ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record was compiled from information in the National Gallery Annual Reports . ) In summary , of the 461 painting acquisitions in this ten-year period , 365 , or in excess of 79 percent , were twentieth-century works . By contrast , of the 84 special painting exhibitions during that same period , only fourteen , or 16.2 percent , dealt with the twentieth century , and of those fourteen exhibitions , only four could be considered " difficult " in their advanced visual concepts and degree of abstraction ( see Table 4.1 ) . Why does the National Gallery dedicate such a relatively small percentage of exhibitions to recent art ? Part of the answer may be found in attendance figures . Two special exhibitions seem to have heightened the Gallery 's awareness of attendance figures . Prior to 1986 , attendance growth was generally consistent , showing small , healthy increases no doubt tied to increased leisure time and increased travel . In 1986 , however , there was a sudden and striking increase in attendance as two of the special exhibitions offered proved to be highly popular . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Painting : Impressionism " were responsible for increasing the number of visitors by .3.6 million over the 198.5 fiscal year record of .5.1 million for a total of 8.1 million . ( Attendance figures are taken from the National Gallery Annual Reports . ) The Gallery had not calculated the unprecedented numbers and was forced to quickly hire and train more than 40 temporary employees to assist the education department in their responsibility of crowd control ( National Gallery Annual Report , 1986 : 70 ) . I-low temporary that new staff was is not clear , since the attendance figures remained quite high through 1987 and 1988 . Almost 7 million visitors attended the Gallery in 1987 and slightly more than 7 million in 1988 . The 1989 Annual Report notes the decline to 6.2 million visits , " a gratifying number during a year marked by a decline generally in Washington tourism " ( p. 9 ) . The numbers over the next four years range between 5 million and 5.6 million visits ( Figure 4.3 ) . While the National Gallery is celebrated for its scholarly research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and benefits of drawing large numbers of the population can not go unnoticed . The schedule of popular exhibitions , of exhibitions of realism as opposed to abstraction , greatly outnumber the art generally considered to he less popular , more difficult for the untrained eye to appreciate ( Table 4.2 ) . No one can dispute the level of the special exhibitions , which is certainly very high , but one must question the apparent neglect of a huge body of international art production , the prominent thrust of an entire century . A government-funded museum has an obligation , some would argue , to address the common denominator and satisfy democratic taste . However , having assumed a position of authority from which it defines the standard by which all art can be judged , the National Gallery also assumes a responsibility to provide a basis for informed judgement . This can only happen through exhibitions . The National Gallery , funded primarily by taxpayers ' dollars , is free and open to the public every day of the year , except December 25 . Since revenue from admissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what are the relevant considerations that should be noted ? The first is the importance of private funds and the role of corporations in Gallery financing . A review of financial records shows that most of the Gallery 's operating budget ( 79 ? 85% ) comes from the federal government . The remaining 15 ? 21 percent is supplied by endowments , gifts , and grants . Corporations contribute heavily to special exhibitions underwriting 50 ? 70 per cent of the costs ( Figure 4.4 ; all statistics are compiled from Annual Reports ) . Private companies also provide for opening receptions , brochures , films and other events related to special exhibitions . It is generally accepted , even with museums such as the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan , that corporations fund exhibitions for the purpose of establishing a positive public image and good public relations . ( The corporate/museum partnership is explored in Chapter 7 . ) The continuation of funding therefore depends greatly on the numbers of people reached by the museum . Corporations appreciate high attendance figures and wide dispersement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records , is income from museum shop sales . According to financial reports ( National Gallery Annual Reports ) , in 1986 , the year of special exhibits " Treasure Houses of Britain " and " The New Painting : Impressionism " , revenues from sales of art books , posters , and prints reached $10.2 million , more than doubling the $4.3 million record set in 1985 . Publication sales remained high at $8.8 million in 1987 and then increased by more than 40 percent in 1988 to $12.3 million . The sale of special exhibition catalogs increased 75 percent over the previous year for a total of 200,000 Gallery catalogs . A new medium for the arts is the video cassette . The sale of these Gallery productions increased 75 percent in the course of one year ( National Gallery Annual Report , 1988 : 121 ) . A survey published by the American Council for the Arts , conducted by the National Research Center for the Arts , and sponsored by Philip Morris Companies , reports video cassettes as the most promising medium of growth for the arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Examining the National Gallery figures for these three areas ( corporate contributions for special exhibits , annual attendance figures , and income from museum shop sales ) shows a close correlation between the three ( see Figure 4.4 ) . In 1984 , annual attendance exceeded 4 million visitors , and the budget for special exhibits was about $3 million . When , in 1986 , the budget for special exhibitions moved to $8 million , attendance figures broke all records at 8.7 million visitors . Museum shop sales rose proportionately from $3.6 million in 1984 to $10.2 million in 1986 . Even as attendance figures stabilized between 5 and 6 million into the 1990s , the profits from publications sales remained high , ranging from $9 million to $11.7 million . // Museum shop sales shot up to an unprecedented $12.3 million in 1988 due , in part , to a reorganization of the museum store . " During the year the publications service made changes in the West Building sales shop . Two seating areas and one area of under-used selling space were converted to efficient self-service selling areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and calendars " ( National Gallery Annual Report , 1988 : 121 ) . The museum shop in fact sold more than 2.3 million postcards , prints , note cards , greeting cards , and posters that year . The sale of items such as calendars and address books exceeded 220,000 units . The National Gallery then made plans to expand its mail order market . The museum adopted the corporation 's marketing techniques , and the result was a great sales success . Museum attendance , stimulated by popular special exhibits , boosts museum shop business and also generates income from corporations wishing a broad audience for programs they sponsor . In 1989 , the publications service experienced its fourth highest year in sales with the special exhibition catalog of " Japan : The Shaping of Daimyo Culture " as the bestseller . A total of 100,000 catalogs were sold . As reported in the National Gallery Annual Report ( p. 73 ) , temporary sales areas were opened to offer , as the Report indicates , " convenience , service , and a selection of focused materials . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up at the exits of special exhibitions in order to promote the exhibition catalog . It is also noted that while 600,000 visitors were served in person , another 7,000 were served through the mail . In 1990 , these numbers would grow to over 700,000 visitors and 7,500 mail orders . In 1991 , the bestselling catalogs were " Titian " and " Van Dyck , " and the grand total of books and catalogs sold was over 200,000 . These numbers remained constant in 1992 as " Circa 1492 " proved to be a very popular exhibition catalog . Although the number of visitors served in person by the bookstores dropped to 500,000 , the total number of books sold remained at 200,000 . This may have been due in part to the expansion of children 's books which , the Report noted , " increased sales of these books by 20 percent " ( p. 68 ) . The popularity of the " Barnes " exhibition and accompanying catalog resulted in an increase in sales in 1993 . Visitors purchased 268,880 catalogs and books and more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Board of Trustees approved of a " line of products being offered by the Gallery 's sales shops " which includes sculptural reproductions and jewelry related to the collections . The Gallery continues to pursue distribution and licensing agreements in commercial markets throughout the world as a way to provide broad exposure to the Gallery 's collections and , of course , to generate additional revenue . It is important to note that all revenue from publication sales is used to support publications . The third major influence to be considered when analyzing the seemingly conservative special exhibition schedule of the National Gallery // is the watchful eye of the Congress of the United States . As has been noted , most of the Gallery 's operating budget ( 79% , ? 85% , ) comes from the federal government , a government that in recent years has become more watchful of taxpayers ' dollars . As political and economic tensions heighten , museum exhibits funded by the federal government are likely to be more closely scrutinized and more openly criticized . The National Gallery has no record of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) from Congress . But on record and in the press other noteworthy institutions have not been as fortunate . Perhaps the first major blow-up came in 1989 when the Robert Mapplethorpe exhibition was canceled by Washington 's Corcoran Gallery . A detailed discussion of that decision and its connection to the National Endowment for the Arts will come later . First , let us review briefly recent actions within the Smithsonian Institution . The National Museum of American Art , a division of the Smithsonian , caused a debate with the exhibit " The West as America : Reinterpreting Images of the Frontier . " When the curators matched favorite American paintings of the old west with revisionist interpretations which cited the paintings as propaganda for the nineteenth-century concept of Manifest Destiny , the exhibit generated great controversy . Much discussion took place both in art and history circles , in and out of museums , and in and out of the United States Congress , members of which threatened the museum with economic penalties . Senator Ted Williams called the exhibition perverted and criticized the Smithsonian for having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the Smithsonian , planned an exhibition to mark the 50th anniversary of the flight of the Enola Gay , the plane used in 1945 to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima . The exhibition , which intended to examine the decision to use the atomic bomb from different perspectives , was challenged by veterans ' organizations , the Air Force Association , and members of Congress . This resulted in the cancellation of the exhibit as planned . The Smithsonian chose instead to simply exhibit portions of the plane without question or comment . This approach , according to Smithsonian Secretary , I. Michael Heyman , would create an exhibit " every American can be proud of " instead of one distorted , as charged by House Speaker Newt Gingrich , by left-wing ideologies . The attempt to satisfy democratic demands may call into question the entire definition and role of interpretation in America museums , especially when the interpretation risks challenging those things , as discussed in Chapter 1 , that American museums were built to promote : prestige , patriotism , and moral elevation . What at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , secure income provided by Congress allows the freedom to pursue scholarly research and exhibitions , may have complications resulting in a // downside . Is the special exhibition schedule determined , not solely by research on the collection and the charge " to make those works of art known and enjoyed by the people of this country , " but also by populist pressures ? Has the corporate underwriting of special exhibits exerted influence on curatorial decisions ? ( see Chapter 7 . ) Has the museum , through the corporate presence and influence , developed a marketing strategy that is driven as much by commercial concerns as educational ones ? Have the very recent developments , such as the populous events of 1988 , and the outspoken anger of congressional leaders , altered museum practice and policy in a way that is in conflict with the museum 's mission ? While the Smithsonian Institution contains the nation 's federally funded art museums , other American museums and art institutions are touched by the federal government because they receive federal funding through the National Endowment for the Arts . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Endowment for the Arts was established as an independent agency of the Federal Government , created in 1965 to encourage and assist the nations ' cultural resources . The Endowment is advised by the National Council on the Arts , a presidentially appointed body composed of the Chairman of the Endowment and 26 distinguished private citizens who are widely recognized for their expertise or interest in the arts . The Council advises the Endowment on policies , procedures , and programs , in addition to making recommendations on grant applications . ( National Endowment Act , 1965 ) The statement of mission for the Endowment as described in the literature speaks in lofty language of man 's desire to create and his need to express his perception of the world . It is through art that we can understand ourselves and our potential and while the arts in America have always been supported directly by the people , it is also an appropriate matter of concern for the Federal Government . The government recognizes that man 's need to make , experience , and comprehend art is as profound as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts and to broaden their availability . ( National Endowment for the Arts Guidelines ) The potential for government support to slip into government interference was addressed from the beginning , and all N.E.A. materials had references to this . America 's governance is based on freedom ; freedom of thought , freedom of action , freedom of expression . In setting up the National Endowment , a commitment to these freedoms was reinforced . In implementing its mission the Endowment must exercise care to preserve and improve the environment in which the arts have flourished . It must not , under any circumstances , impose a single aesthetic standard or attempt to direct artistic content . ( National Endowment Act , 1965 ) Livingston Riddle , in his book about the birth and growth of the National Endowment for the Arts , Our Government and the Arts : A Perspective from the Inside , writes in optimistic tones of how the new endeavor " fostered a belief that the arts are of central importance in our lives . " Riddle drafted the original legislation and served first as deputy chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biddle , 1988 ) . In July 1989 , the former director acknowledged to the New York Times that circumstances had made it clear that Congress wanted more accountability on the part of the Endowment and that he considered their recent actions " overly punitive " and " a very dangerous precedent " ( Gamarekian , 1989c ) . Twenty-five years after the founding of the National Endowment , the United States Senate voted to restrict N.E.A. funds from use " to promote , disseminate , or produce obscene or indecent materials , including but not limited to depictions of sadomasochism , homoeroticism , the exploitation of children , or individuals engaged in sex acts , or material which denigrates the objects or beliefs of the adherents of a particular religion or nonreligion . " The bill , sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina , would also bar grants for art work that " denigrates , debases or reviles a person , group or class of citizens on the basis of race , creed , sex , handicap , age or national origin . " The events that brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censorship in America and the influence of the government on art museums . The controversy began in June , 1989 when , at the prospect of congressional disapproval , Christina Orr-Cahall , then Director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington , D.C. , canceled a touring show of photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe . ( Mapplethorpe died of AIDS in March of 1989 . ) The exhibition was a retrospective of the artist 's work that contained , as described in the New York Times , images depicting homosexual and heterosexual erotic acts and explicit sadomasochistic practices in which black and white , naked or leather-clad men and women assume erotic poses . Along with these photographs are fashionable portraits of the rich and trendy , elegant floral arrangements and naked children ? images that might not necessarily be considered indecent if viewed singly but that in this context seem provocative . ( Signs accompanying the show on its tour suggested that it might be unsuitable for children . ) ( Glueck , 1989a : 1 ) The touring show , organized by the Institute of Contemporary Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Endowment for the Arts . The show was seen in Philadelphia , at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago , and at the Whitney Museum in New York without incident . Its viewing in Washington , D.C. , however , was to coincide with a congressional review of the N.E.A. budget . The House Appropriations Committee had already approved a proposal to make the // N.E.A. " more accountable for all the work they support " ( Gamarckian , 1989a ) as a result of criticism of the Mapplethorpe show . " We had the institutional responsibility to decide if this was the right environment in which to present the show , " said Dr. Orr-Cahall in a New York Times interview in July . There would have been a lot of folderol about it , with attention directed away from substantive issues , such as the effort in Congress to emasculate the endowment . It would be a three-ring circus in which Mapplethorpe 's work would never be looked at in its own right . We knew that certain Congressmen were just waiting for us to open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pressure . It was a no-win situation . We decided we would n't be anyone 's political platform . ( Glueck , 1989a : 9 ) Dr. Jacob Neusner , Brown University Professor and Reagan-appointed member of the National Endowment 's advisory council , the National Council on the Arts , disagreed with Dr. Orr-Cahall . He felt the cancellation of the Mapplethorpe exhibition was pusillanimous and dishonest in the extreme . There was absolutely no pressure on them from the endowment , and to say they were defending us is ridiculous . It is our job to take the heat , and our process knows how to deal with controversy . But they betrayed the process by acting as censors . In doing so they raised the stakes . Had they not , the whole thing would have gone away . A Congressman or two might have visited the show and complained , and that would have been the end of it . Now it will never go away . ( Glueck , July 9 , 1989a : 9 ) On July 12 , the House of Representatives administered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they voted 361 to 65 in favor of an amendment that reduced the Endowment 's 1990 budget by $45,000 . Although that $45,000 was a small part of the Endowment 's $171.4 million appropriation for the 1990 fiscal year , it represented the exact amount of Endowment-related funding for the Mapplethorpe exhibit and one other controversial show involving a photograph by Andres Serrano depicting a plastic crucifix submerged in the artist 's urine . It was a clear message and followed hours of congressional debate over the art projects and the proper use of taxpayers ' money ( Gamarekian , 1989b ) . On July 25 , the Senate Appropriations Committee took the controversy a step further when they voted for a five-year ban on N.E.A. grants to the two museums , the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia , and the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art in Wiston-Salem , North Carolina , that had originated the exhibitions of Mapplethorpe and Serrano photographs . The cancellation of the exhibit at the Corcoran Gallery along with the measures on the part of the House and the Senate were viewed by artists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts and to the first amendment guarantee of free speech . The actions taken by the Congress , in particular the move to ban N.E.A. funding to the two organizations that had supported the exhibitions , were viewed as " shocking . " Hugh Southern , then acting director of the endowment , called the action " a dangerous precedent which goes against the long and widely respected system of Federal support for the arts through a competitive peer-review process " ( Gamarekian , 1989c ) . The Corcoran 's cancellation was viewed by many as a form of self-censorship by a museum . It seemed a direct challenge to the symbolic role of both the artist and the museum in America . Grace Glueck of the New York Times wrote : Artists are important to us , among other reasons , because of their ability to express what is deep or hidden in our consciousness , what we can not or will not express ourselves and museums are traditionally the neutral sanctuaries ? entered voluntarily by the public ? for this expression . ( 1989a : 9 ) It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always please , but that is the privilege we give to the museum and the museum in turn gives to art . For a museum to censor itself cuts this trust and alters the understanding . While the majority of the Corcoran 's board supported the decision to cancel , some viewed it as wrong . Robert Lehrman , a Corcoran board member , expressed his disappointment to the New York Times when he said that external pressures should not impact on the museum 's judgement . " We have relinquished our responsibility to be , as is carved in stone over the entrance , Dedicated to Art ' " ( quoted in Glueck , 1989a : 19 ) . Lehrman 's view of the role of the museum was affirmed when , in September , following two months of protests by artists in the form of canceled shows and boycotts , the Corcoran issued a statement of regret for the cancellation . At the same time , some members of the staff proposed that the museum present an exhibit on censorship that might include the work of both Mapplethorpe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation ( New York Times , September 9 , 1989 , Section 1 : 11 ) . The apology of the board and director was not enough to mend the broken ties to the art community , and artists who had canceled their exhibits in protest refused to reinstate them . The boycott continued , making contemporary exhibits and programs impossible . The boycott was accompanied by staff resignations and outcries for the director 's resignation . As Tom Armstrong , then director of the Whitney Museum , observed , " When an art museum reverses a decision based on professional judgement because of outside pressures , the integrity of the museum is severely impaired " ( quoted in Glueck , 1989a : 9 ) . The resignation of Christina Orr-Cahall came in December , six months after the controversy began . In the midst of all this furor several arts advocates , beginning with the // American Association of Museums , expressed their views on the role of government in subsidizing the arts . The American Association of Museums issued a background paper for members of Congress which stated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may he offensive , the greater risk is a restriction of freedom of expression and individual judgement that would compromise the necessary openness of a democratic society . The test of a democracy is not that the majority gets its way , but that the minority 's free access to the full choice of ideas is protected along with its ability to express those ideas . ( American Association of Museums , 1989 ) The American Council for the Arts released a position paper that declared : The American people have no need for the government to screen or edit art for them . Each adult American has an inalienable right to choose ... which art to view ... In a society that is as broad and as free as ours , a society with so many differing voices and opinions , we are not only tolerant of various artistic and political expression , we take great pride in that tolerance ... There will always be art that offends some taxpaying Americans some of the time . Censorship , however , offends Americans all of the time . Traditional American values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( American Council for the Arts , 1989 ) The College Art Association provided guidelines for members concerned with the issues . Art must not be equated with entertainment . Society assigns to art an important purpose : to keep our citizens in touch with their past , to define the present , and to consider the future . Serious art explores new frontiers , celebrates individuality , and mirrors the diverse ideas and values that characterize American society . Art can be controversial and confrontational , and can reflect elements of our society that are offensive to some . Art , by its very nature , involves risk if it is to succeed and grow . The climate of freedom prescribed by the Endowment 's authorizing legislation must continue . ( College Art Association , 1989 ) Compromise legislation and political fallout After months of debate , a House ? Senate conference committee reached a compromise agreement on the amendment that would severely restrict projects eligible for N.E.A. grants . The agreement retained a portion of the Senator Jesse Helms amendment " to prohibit the use of N.E.A. funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgement of the Endowment may be considered obscene . " What was struck from the amendment was the provision banning funds for " indecent " material that denigrates a religion , a person , or a group or class of citizens on the basis of race , creed , sex , handicap , or national origin . The conferees also borrowed language from a Supreme Court decision on obscenity standards ( Miller vs . U.S. , 1973 ) and tacked that to the amendment prohibiting funding of materials which may be considered obscene and " which do not have serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value . " Following the adoption of the revised legislation by Congress came an incident that stunned the arts community . " We could see immediately that the compromise arts funding bill passed by Congress was a huntinglicense for the ultra-conservatives , " said Ted Potter , director of the Center for Contemporary Art in Winston Salem , " but we did n't expect the first shot to be fired by the N.E.A. " ( Honan , 1989a ) . The National Endowment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AIDS to be held at a nonprofit gallery in New York City . On November 8 , John E. Frohnmayer , the newly appointed chairman of the Endowment , announced that he had suspended a $10,000 federal grant which had been approved by an Endowment panel in May , and asked that the Endowment not be listed as a sponsor . Mr. Frohnmayer said he took the action against the exhibition , " Witnesses : Against Our Vanishing , " because of derogatory references in the show 's catalog to political and religious figures . The host of the exhibit , a nonprofit gallery called Artists ' Space , then located in the Tri-Be-Ca section of Manhattan , had an excellent reputation as an alternative museum devoted to contemporary art . Founded in 1973 , the organization had a 1989 annual budget of $725,000 . Roughly 40 percent of that came from public grants by the National Endowment , the New York State Council on the Arts , the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs and the Institute of Museum Services ( another federal agency ) . In other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not exist without public money . Yet , it had proven its value , providing first showings to artists such as Scott Burton , Jonathan Borofsky , and Barbara Kruger . In short , Artists ' Space was respected and had built and maintained an excellent relationship over the years with government groups that support art , including the National Endowment . As the N.E.A. withdrew its sponsorship of " Witnesses : Against Our Vanishing , " Susan Wyatt , director of Artists ' Space denied that the exhibit was political , saying it was an attempt to depict the emotions and spirituality felt by AIDS patients and their friends . She said she notified the Endowment in advance about the contents of the AIDS exhibit because I was concerned that the N.E.A. not be blindsided and that Artists ' Space not be blindsided . I never anticipated all this would happen . Artists ' Space is a cultural organization , not an activist organization . I have nothing against activism , but that is not our goal . It 's important to point out that I do n't consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of the art world , at least until now . ( Kimmelman , 1989 ) The protests against the action taken by the National Endowment were // immediate and strong and included the American Arts Alliance , PEN American ( : enter , the College Art Association , and many prominent individuals . Joseph Papp , producer of the New York Shakespeare Festival , called the action " an assault on the principles we think of as fundamental in our society . " Leonard Bernstein , nominated for the prestigious National Medal of Arts , declined to accept the award in protest . In Washington , the Endowment 's visual arts panel , the panel which decides on Endowment grants , expressed their " disappointment and distress " over Mr. Frohnmayer 's decision and urged him , " make public your commitment to the peer panel process and the Endowment 's original mandate to foster the excellence , diversity , and vitality of the arts in this country " ( Honan , 1989a ) . It was all more than Frohnmayer anticipated or could stand against . On November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Space and to announce the restoration of the grant . " After consulting with members of the National Council on the Arts , several of whom have seen the show , I have agreed to approve the request of Artists Space to amend the fiscal ' 89 grant and will release the grant " ( Honan , 1989c ) . " We are feeling our way along in a situation which none of us really wanted , under a law which none of us think is necessary " ( quoted in Honan , 1989b ) . " Not necessary " and also " ambiguous " were the terms used by many . Representative Pat Williams of Montana , when addressing the House subcommittee that oversees the National Endowment , asserted It may well be that in responding to recent Congressional language the N.E.A. has begun to have a chilling effect on art in the United States and it may be entering the quicksand of censorship . This committee must thoughtfully consider whether the Federal Government can maintain an environment necessary for artistic creativity to flourish while fulfilling the recent Congressional mandate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quality . Congressional pressure has placed N.E.A. on a slippery slope . The Endowment 's authorizing language prohibits it from interfering with the content of the art it subsidizes but Congress is demanding more restrictions on the Endowment 's grant making . ( Quoted in Gamarekian , 1989d ) Looking back on the Congressional interference with the Smithsonian Institution of 150 years ago , one recognizes that the autonomy of the museum system was saved by the Smithsonian Regents . The conflict today with Congress over N.E.A. funding of controversial art was deepened by the actions of the Corcoran Gallery and the Endowment itself . The rescue of the National Endowment and the restoration of its original mission statement which demands that the Endowment " must not , under any circumstances , impose a single aesthetic standard or attempt to direct artistic content " was left to independent arts advocacy groups . Some believed the effort of Senator Jesse Helms was not directed at legislating art but rather at the reduction and , eventually , total dissolution of federal funding for the arts . The National Endowment for the Arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990 was one of those years . The debate over the restrictive language introduced and the debate over the very existence of federal funding for the arts became intense during that period . Arts advocacy groups rallied for insurance that no form of censorship or restriction of content be allowed to become part of the reauthorization legislation under which the life of the Endowment is extended . Representative Pat Williams prophetically referred to this as " a critical time in the history of federal support of the nation 's cultural life . A small minority who oppose Federal support of the arts are on a war footing and are intent on killing or crippling the arts endowment " ( quoted in Gamarekian , 1990 ) . In each successive review of the endowment , funding would be further reduced and the authorization period shortened . The orchestrated demise of the National Endowment was under way . Conclusion The National Endowment for the Arts and the National Gallery of Art were both founded by an Act of Congress and financially supported by American taxpayers , yet designed to be independent of Congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the institutions ' autonomy in order to insure the institutions ' standards . The National Endowment confirms its belief that " man 's need to make , experience , and comprehend art is as profound as his need to speak , " while guaranteeing that Congress will never " under any circumstances , impose a single aesthetic standard or attempt to direct artistic content . " Such judgements were to be left to the panel of art experts . The National Gallery , which is the property of the people of the United States and is supported by their tax dollars , exists as specified by its founder , Andrew Mellon , for the " purpose of encouraging and developing a study of the fine arts ... art of the highest standard of quality . " When Andrew Mellon first proposed the idea of a National Gallery to the President of the United States , he stated clearly his wish to have the gallery administered by a " competent and separate board of trustees " in order to safeguard that the " highest standard of quality will always be maintained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the founders sought to control the democratic influences on these two institutions , the safeguards established early on have proven vulnerable . The blatant disciplinary actions by the Congress against the National Endowment were efforts to impose aesthetic standards and to direct content . The possibility of Congressional influence on exhibition programs at the National Gallery should be viewed with clear and discerning perceptions and a reckoning of history . The schedule of popular exhibits draws large crowds which pleases Congress and the NO The American Art Museum corporate sponsors of the special exhibits , but apparently ignores the huge body of abstract , more difficult art produced in this century and held in the Gallery 's collection . Government funding of art institutions appears to bring with it democratic influences which may he in conflict with the higher institutional goals . These influences have the potential to change the role of the art museum in the American culture in ways our forefathers tried to guard against . 5 The development of American modernism and its influence on the American art museum Introduction The Museum of Modern Art in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street in November , 1939 . This modern structure designed by Philip Goodwin and Edward Durell Stone is considered to be the first truly modern museum . What is meant by the concept of modernism as it applies to art and architecture and how modernism has impacted on the American art museum are the issues to be examined in this chapter . The term " modern " as used here refers to the modern period as defined by the Museum of Modern Art , that is the period since 1880 . It also refers to a particular use of formal elements as described in the writings of Alfred Barr . ( Barr and the Museum of Modern Art are discussed in Chapters 8 and 9 . ) When linked with art and architecture it refers to a multiplicity of styles and schools of thought which parallel changes in the industrial , technical , political , economic , social , and spiritual conditions of the twentieth-century . Modernism developed in Europe and was first introduced to the American art world through the Armory Show , the exhibition of modern European art held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American Painters and Sculptors , 1913 : 11-13 ) . This exhibit had a major impact on working artists of the period . At that point , a few American artists were experimenting with variations of cubism , which - resulted in the development of American abstraction . ( For example , see the work of Arthur Dove in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art . ) Artists focused on the expressive potential of the elements of art such as rhythmic lines and vibrant colors . Even much of the realism of the day emphasized abstract composition . Alfred Stieglitz exhibited the work of John Marin , Georgia O'Keefe , Arthur Dove , and other innovative painters in his New York City gallery early on ( Lynes , 1989 : 5 ) . It was , however , the influx of European artists and architects during World War II that etched the lasting mark of modernism on American art and architecture and allowed the development of the first truly American art movements . // The artists fleeing Paris for New York in the wake of the Nazi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's system of higher education as well as in New York 's cafes . At the same time American collectors began to establish museums dedicated to modern art . ( The development of the first Museum of Modern Art is covered in Chapter 8 . ) All of this resulted in the creation of a New York avant-garde which quickly began to replace Paris as the dominant center for art . We will examine first the informal means of influence on the American culture exerted by European artists through personal contact with American artists in New York City cafes and through public exhibitions , in particular by the artists affiliated with the Surrealist movement . Secondly , we will look at the formal means of influence exerted through the American system of higher education , especially by transplanted Bauhaus faculty . These two influences , the philosophy of Surrealism and the Bauhaus philosophy , can be viewed as the two parallel yet opposing approaches to the making of American art and architecture that would dominate and define the American modernist movement . American modernism would in turn determine the architecture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical , systematic , instructional space demanded by a democratic society . Surrealism made its impact first , while the Bauhaus influence would be somewhat delayed . Coming through the educational system , the Bauhaus philosophy was felt in the next artistic generation and was felt most profoundly by architects of the day . The Surrealists ' contact was directly with young working artists hungry for new ideas from Paris and so its impact was immediate . The influence of Surrealism Surrealism was recognized as the most widely influential aesthetic movement between World Wars I and II . Its impact was due in part to the movement of artists as a result of the war and also to the attitude that held Surrealism to be not just an art movement , but a philosophy of life ( Barr , 1936b : 8 ) . Basically , Surrealism looked to the subconscious , dream world as a means to discover and express truth . It depended on intuition and instinct rather than rational , logical thought processes . Andre Breton , the poet and Father of Surrealism , defined it as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations , previously neglected , in the omnipotence of dreams , and in the disinterested play of thinking . " The Surrealist artists settling in New York City included Marcel Duchamp , Yves Tanguy , Roberto Matta Echaurren , Andre Masson , Max Ernst , and Man Ray . For the most part they were a congenial group willing to share their ideas and methods within the Parisian mode of the cafe or the salon . One very important meeting ground was Peggy Guggenheim 's gallery , American modernism as Art of This Century . Peggy Guggenheim described the gallery as " a center where all the artists were welcome and so they treated it as a sort of club " ( Guggenheim , 1979 : 317 ) . It was in this gallery that the first American Abstract Expressionists exhibited their work . One-person shows of the paintings of Jackson Pollock , Robert Motherwell , William Baziotes , Hans Hoffman , Mark Rothko , Clifford Still , and David Hare were presented . Another important salon was Roberto Matta Echaurren 's Ninth Street studio , where a number of artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 's work and analyze the images . One of the first exhibits to bring Europeans and Americans together was the " First Papers of Surrealism " held in 1942 at the Whitelow Reid Mansion on Madison Avenue . The exhibition included works by Masson , Matta and Ernst along with the young Americans Baziotes , Gorky and Motherwell ( Jean , 1967 : 312 ? 13 ) . Organized with the assistance of the French artist Marcel Duchamp , the exhibition succeeded in closing the gap of colonial modernism and rooting Surrealist concepts in American soil . Duchamp installed at this exhibition his Mile of String . The string crisscrossed the gallery space , looped over the exhibition panels and clustered in tangles in front of the paintings . Photos documenting the event show that the string kept the visitor from entering the gallery and made viewing the works of art impossible but it also defined the gallery space in a way in which it had never before been defined and ultimately transformed it into a work of art . Duchamp addressed the modernist sensibility in the literal use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , in an immediate and powerful way , commented on the effect of context on art . The Mile of String functioned like a spider 's web to catch and hold the paintings on the gallery walls , trapping them in a specific moment , and rendering them unapproachable and obsolete . Duchamp was commenting on art exhibitions and on the context in which we view art . The context within which we view the work of art can alter , diminish or intensify the meaning the object carries . Duchamp was born on the outskirts of Rouen to a cultured bourgeois family who loved chess and music and art . Early on he worked as a printer and also did cartoons for the Courrier Francois and Le Rire . His early work seems influenced by Cezanne , but he quickly came to know and imitate Fauvism , and by 1911 , at the age of 24 , the influence of Cubism can be seen ( D'Harnoncourt and McShine , 1973 : 12 ? 13 ; Moure , 1988 : 11 ? 13 ) . Duchamp was known for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the professional art world ) and he was a master of irony ( Breton , 1972 : 86 ? 8 ) . He had the ability to deliberately exploit the absurd while appearing completely serious . These traits can be seen as contributing to the development of Dada , and later to Surrealism . Nude Descending a Staircase ( Collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art ) was painted in 1912 and exhibited the following year in the Armory Show . It aroused immense curiosity and outrage and placed Duchamp in a position of influence among American painters ( Hamilton , Richard , in D'Harnoncourt and McShine , 1973 : 63 ) . When the artist arrived in New York in 1914 , fleeing from the war in Europe , he found that he was already famous , and reporters came to interview him . Duchamp returned to New York , again to escape war , in 1942 . It was at this time that he helped organize , along with Andre Breton , the " First Papers of Surrealism " exhibition ( Jean , 1967 : 312 ? 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art hypothesis was instigated by Duchamp with the invention of the " readymade " . The " readymade " was a manufactured object assigned the dignity of an art object through the context in which it was placed . Duchamp appropriated a urinal and , placing it atop a pedestal , assigned it the title Fountain ( Collection of The Museum of Modern Art , NYC ) . With this gesture he asserted the belief that art can be created through the power of context . A bicycle wheel mounted upsidedown on a wooden stool is another example of a Duchamp readymade ( Collection of The Museum of Modern Art , NYC ) . He was in many ways the ultimate Surrealist , maintaining his freedom , holding nothing sacred . His readymades call into question our ideas concerning value in art . They // were a way to separate art and money . " In art and only in art , " said Duchamp , " the original work is sold , and it acquires a sort of aura that way . But with my readymades a replica will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he did not hold to a particular style but connected the making of art to the living of life ( Andrews , 1990 : 31-3 ) , a philosophy essential to the formation of American modernism. // This philosophy would be adopted by the young Americans and would include an intense interest in psychology and psychoanalysis , especially an interest in the role of the unconscious in the making of art . Seeking a means to express certain universal truths , the American artists employed symbols and signs and myths , in methods similar to those of the Europeans . What evolved at this point was a new process for the making of art , a process that was based on personal expression and personal experience voiced within a universal concept . Surrealism and Jackson Pollock The artist who best exemplifies this aesthetic impulse is the American Abstract Expressionist , Jackson Pollock . Pollock 's painting had a strong emotional content from the start . Although he began his career under the influence of the American scene painters , in particular Thomas Hart Benton , Pollock 's work was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , circa 1935 , Collection of The Museum of Modern Art , NYC ) . He quickly discovered the Mexican muralists Orozco and Siqueiros , whose expressionism touched him . By the late 1930s Pollock was ripe for the Surrealist aesthetic and connected both with the symbolic imagery and with the methods of automatism ( Naifeh and Smith , 1989 : 426 ) . He , along with the other New York painters Rothko , Motherwell , and Baziotes , used the automatic painting techniques of the Surrealists to reveal what they believed to be universal symbols that inhabited the inner mind . Pollock took the Surrealists ' automatic techniques to an extreme and by 1947 was producing his " drip " paintings . Pollock would place the unstretched , often unsized , canvas on the floor of his studio and , with paint in hand , he would move around and even across the canvas dripping , flinging , spotting the pigment in great gestures that involved his entire body . When I am in my painting , I 'm not aware of what I 'm doing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I see what I have been about . I have no fears about making changes , destroying the image , etc. , because the painting has a life of its own . I try to let it come through . It is only when I lose contact with the painting that the result is a mess . Otherwise there is pure harmony , an easy give and take , and the painting comes out well . ( Pollock , 1947 ? 48 : 79 ) The images were therefore produced by the movements and gestures of his entire body , not just his wrist and elbow . This method emphasized the process of painting as opposed to the finished product ( Sandler , 1970 : 102 ) . It registered the energy , drama , passion of the moment and forced the viewer to respond actively rather than as a passive observer . These paintings appeared revolutionary to the art public of the day , for not only were they completely non-objective but they seemingly defied even the // formal elements of art since there was no focal point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , Autumn Rhythm , 1950 , Collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art . ) They required the viewer to possess information about and understanding of the painting process . Pollock 's interest in myth stemmed from the Surrealist aesthetic also and , like the emphasis on process , required the viewer to approach the painting informed . Pollock said in an interview in 1944 I accept the fact that the important painting of the last hundred years was done in France ... the fact that good European moderns are now here is very important , for they bring with them an understanding of the problems of modern painting . I am particularly impressed with their concept of the source of art being the unconscious . ( Pollock , 1944 : 14 ) Pollock 's friend John Graham , while exploring the role of the unconscious in art , identified two factors in primitive art : first , " the degree of freedom of access to one 's unconscious mind in regard to observed phenomenon , " and second , " an understanding of the possibilities of the plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of design and composition as opposed to the deliberate which is valueless " ( Graham , 1937 : 236-7 ) . Clearly , Jackson Pollock 's methodology related to both of these factors . Pollock 's ideas about primitive art and mythology were influenced also by Carl Jung , and in fact Pollock was in therapy with a Jungian analyst from 1939 on ( Naifeh and Smith , 1989 : 327-38 ) . Pollock and the other Americans differed from the European Surrealists in their orientation to Jung rather than Freud . Jung 's publication , Symbols of Transformation ( 1956 ) , for example , described close parallels between ancient myths and psychotic fantasies . Jung developed his theories through the use of history and mythology , especially the history and mythology of primitive cultures . He made the distinction between the personal unconscious and the collective unconscious , which he defined as being those thoughts , feelings and memories shared by the group and which manifest themselves symbolically in myths . Jung explained human motivation in terms of a larger creative energy . Aware of these ideas , Pollock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Schimmel , 1986 : 26 ) . He lifted symbols and signs from other cultures and employed myths as a means to enter into deeper preconscious realms . Eventually the references became less specific and he came to depend on the act of painting rather than on the iconography to express these ideas . Painting became for Pollock a ritualistic act so that he illustrated , interpreted , and symbolized myths // through the process rather than the image . ' I he content was mythic in spirit and intended to provoke in the viewer either ecstasy or anxiety . Pollock conceived the content of a painting as being action , free and dramatic . These factors , the technical and poetic information contained in pure painting and the use of psychology , mythology , and history in the making of art , resulted in work that was very difficult for the public to understand . The new art often demanded specific knowledge such as a knowledge of Freudian or Jungian concepts as they were applied to visual art , a knowledge of mythology , an understanding of the poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic elements of art and how they might be interpreted within the visual language . ( The role of museum education in American modernism is addressed in Chapter 6 . ) In sum , American modernism required the viewer to be intellectually , sensually , and emotionally cognizant of visual language . The new art forms being produced were not accessible on other levels , not accessible without specific knowledge and therefore potentially selective in audience . The regionalism that had dominated American art thus far in the century provided , through its narrative element , a point of entry for the man on the street , and provided also , through the realist style , a basis for judgement for even the untrained eye ( i.e. Does the cornfield look like a cornfield ? ) . Now Americans were faced with unrecognizable images executed in a fashion that had no relation to ordinary experience and were expected to respond , if not intellectually , at least on a gut level . The reaction of the average American to modern art was often imbued with suspicion and , in some instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 42-3 ) . While the new art posed problems amidst the American democratic culture because of its inaccessibility , it also satisfied certain democratic longings . This kind of painting focused on the individual , on the emotions and ideas of the maker . It was a celebration of American individualism , and its practitioners became culture heroes ( Naifeh and Smith , 1989 : 595 ) . Again , Jackson Pollock is an excellent example of this phenomenon . Pollock had come out of Wyoming , he was strong and tough and projected the spirit of an American cowboy . His paintings referred to the rituals of American Indians and he compared himself to the sand painters of the West . The process he employed was athletic , it was far from any effeminate image Americans held about easel painting but appeared , on the contrary , quite masculine , vigorous , even wild . Jackson Pollock 's technique of painting was recorded both in still photographs and on moving film and was presented to the American people through the popular press . Pollock became a kind of culture hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American artist . Millions of Americans who would never actually see his paintings , nor understand fully their history or inspiration , were nevertheless moved by the activity of this rebel Time magazine labeled " Jack the Dripper " ( Eliot , 1949 ) . // The photographs taken by the artist Hans Namuth capture Pollock in his studio . We sec the artist holding not a palette but a can of house paint in one hand while with a brush or stick in the other he applies the paint . The canvas is spread on the floor in front of him and he moves around it and across it in an aggressive manner . I le is fully absorbed in the activity , not as a contemplative artist but as a man of action ( see plate 15 ) . In another Namuth photograph we see Pollock alone , a huge canvas serves as backdrop . He is dwarfed by his own creation and appears alienated . These images succeeded in conjuring up in the American imagination a poignant vision of the artist as existential hero . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview with William Wright , " that the modern painter can not express this age , the airplane , the atom bomb , the radio , in the old forms of the Renaissance or of any other past culture ... the modern artist , it seems to me , is working and expressing an inner world .... " Pollock as offered up by the media satisfied the yearnings of a postwar generation who sought spontaneity and rebellion in a repressed , grayflannel world . The media had discovered the world of high art and had found the means of digesting it and converting reality into myth . By focusing on the activity of painting , the press avoided serious analysis of the finished product , they avoided addressing the role of the objects in the history of Western art . Furthermore , the photographs emphasized the artist more so than the art . Since the paintings reveal so little through reproduction , losing the qualities of color and texture , the personality of the artist was allowed to dominate . Pollock became a media hero , his image took on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first lessons in the business of marketing art were learned . The influence of the German Bauhaus The second influence on the development of American modernism was exerted by those transplanted artists , designers , and architects from the German Bauhaus . During World War II the Nazis forced the closing of the Bauhaus School of Design and this key faculty emigrated to the United States . This period of emigration is , in general , considered to be significant because , unlike the mass emigrations of the nineteenth century , it did not consist of representatives of politics , business or unskilled labor . Those entering the United States during the 1930s were the representatives of cultural life ? humanists , scientists , and artists . It was in 1937 that Walter Gropius , Herbert Bayer , Josef Albers , Marcel Breuer , Mies van der Rohe , and others from the Bauhaus arrived in New York City . Walter Gropius was made head of the school of architecture at Harvard University and Marcel Breuer joined him there . Josef Albers began teaching at Black Mountain College in North Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the department of art . Mies van der Rohe accepted the position of dean of architecture at the Armour Institute in Chicago , which merged with the Lewis Institute to become the Illinois Institute of Technology ( Hahn , 1990 : 7 ) . Within a short period of time the course of architecture and design in the United States would change , due in part to the buildings these men designed , but mainly to the educational impact they exerted . In his introductory essay to the catalog of the Bauhaus collection at the Busch ? Reisinger Museum , Harvard University , Charles Kuhn writes : For a brief period there were plans to devote a section of the collection to the influence of Bauhaus instruction concepts on American institutions . It was soon realized that Bauhaus influence was so widespread that it would be out of the question to document it completely . ( Kuhn , 1971 : 8 ) The influence of the Bauhaus on American design began with Walter Gropius , the architect , influencing other architects . Gropius came from a family of artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement . He brought architecture into the twentieth-century through the use of industrial materials and techniques . This influence produced designs that were austere , rational , and intelligent ( Whitford , 1988 : 33 ) . Gropius also wished to see architecture play a part in resolving social needs , and to this end he designed numerous working-class housing complexes ( Gropius , 1984 : 126 ) . He promoted standardization and prefabrication and the adaptation of modern materials to modern social needs . Gropius called for a unity of the visual arts , crafts , and design under the primacy of architecture in his Manifesto of April , 1919 . Painters , weavers , ceramicists , graphic designers , all artists and craftsmen alike were taught to engage the problems of architecture . Architecture was for Gropius " the // ultimate art form in which beauty and utility , design and structure could he combined . Buildings were conceived not merely as Functional necessities but as experimental answers serving psychologically based needs " ( Kuhn , 1971 : 14 ) . The idea of controlling an environment through an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , and space , and integrating that environment through the implementation of those simple elements is the essence of Bauhaus design . As the founder and director of the Bauhaus School of Design , Gropius made his influence felt on the broad scale . Architects Louis Skidmore , Louis Kahn , and Edward Durell Stone all made the pilgrimage to Germany early on , as did the Museum of Modern Art director , Alfred Barr ( see " Barr as modernist " in Chapter 8 ) . The Museum of Modern Art 's 1932 " International Exhibit of Modern Architecture " featured photographs and models of the work of Walter Gropius and essays by Henry-Russell Hitchcock , Philip Johnson , and Louis Mumford . Before World War I , Gropius had executed key works in which skeleton and skin were separated into the curtain wall formulation and aesthetically exploited for the first time . The Bauhaus building at Dessau , designed in 1925 , was a classic example of the new aesthetic , with rectangular forms and flat roof . Constructed in steel and glass , it was the pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educator and a man of ideas . Because the Bauhaus was a philosophy and not simply a building , an institute , an art school , it could be transported to American soil and planted in American minds . As Alfred Barr wrote in the preface to an exhibition catalog of Bauhaus design : In America , lighting fixtures and tubular steel chairs were imported or the designs pirated . American Bauhaus students began to return ; and they were followed . . . by Bauhaus and ex-Bauhaus masters ... In this way ... Bauhaus designs , Bauhaus men , Bauhaus ideas ... have been spread throughout the world . ( Barr , 1938 : 5 ? 6 ) Because the Bauhaus philosophy emphasized the design of the total environment , the building , the interior space , and all the objects , both functional and aesthetic , it touched many aspects of American design . Philip Johnson , who studied with Gropius at Harvard University stated in the 1933 exhibition catalog " Objects : 1900 and Today " that the discipline of modern architecture had become so broad that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson called " the minor arts . " He also believed that all design should follow the principles of modern architecture , that it should be objective and logical , that it should employ geometric simplicity in line and form , and that the materials used should be appropriate and true to their nature . Surfaces should be smooth , ornamentation should be avoided , form should be determined by the function . In 1900 the Decorative Arts had a style independent of the architecture of their day , based on imitation of natural forms and lines which curve , // diverge and converge . Today industrial design is functionally motivated and follows the same principles as architecture : machine-like simplicity , smoothness of surface , avoidance of ornament . l he principles of modernism were taught by the Bauhaus faculty now in residence in America 's art schools and universities . At Yale University , Josef Albers continued his Vorkurs ( preliminary course ) . Albers conducted experiments with various materials . " We have first to investigate what a material can do .. . economy of form depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will often have more by doing less " ( Kuhn , 1971 : 30 ) . Reduce and simplify and let the material reveal itself and preserve its inherent qualities . An understanding of the nature of materials was coupled with an understanding of the form they might assume , and economy was stressed all around . Clean lines , no frills and appropriate materials would provide the best design . Perhaps the most obvious example of this is the now classic Breuer chair ( Collection of The Museum of Modern Art , NYC ) . Marcel Breuer epitomized Bauhaus design by rethinking the common chair in the light of new materials and technology ( Whitford , 1988 : 173 ) . Breuer 's chair is practical , comfortable , and light , with an economy of material and line . A salute to the Gropius slogan " Art and Technology ? A New Unity . " ? -r I hr .171 Gropius himself stated shortly before his death that the importance of the Bauhaus could be found in the " attitude intended to provide the art forms of our environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elementary roots " ( Kuhn , 1971 : 25 ) . Elementary roots : art and design reduced to their basic elements of line , form , and color and these elements then analyzed and categorized . Albers ' color theory is an excellent example of the reductive , analytical process . In his own paintings , Homage to the Square series in particular , we see rigid geometric compositions investigating color relationships . The structure is composed of three or four squares superimposed upon one another with the bottom , side and top margins in a 1:2:3 ratio . Each color reacts with the others affecting spatial relationships , hues , and sizes . Albers ' color theory is still the predominant method of instruction today in American art schools . The reductive trend in American art The principles of Bauhaus modernism became pervasive in the American art world , in the classrooms , and in the artists ' studios ; in the galleries and in the museums . Bauhaus faculty and their disciples dominated the 1960s art world inside and out . On the " outside , " Marcel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City . The exterior design is not in the International Style , but in keeping with modernist taste , Breuer 's design provides a vertical stack of loft-like spaces , pure white and unobstructed , ideal for viewing works of art . This was the perfect gallery , the pristine space that shut out worldly distractions . On the " inside " or private world where the individual artist resolves the problems of personal concepts , expressions , and aesthetics , the principles of Bauhaus modernism began to shape the forms of painting and sculpture . Considering the major art " movements " of the period ( geometric and " hard-edge " painting , minimalist sculpture and Pop Art ) we can see the trend toward the reductive , the " truth in materials " dictum , and the logical , objective approach to creating art . The American painter , Frank Stella , is said to have been influenced early in his career by the Abstract Expressionist Hans Hoffman . In 1958 , however , Stella turned from Abstract Expressionism to a drastically reduced and severely ordered style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1960s . Adopting an uncompromising // approach to abstraction , he first painted concentric rectangles of white line that echoed the frame of the canvas against a black background ( for example , Die Fahne Hoch , 1959 , enamel on canvas , Collection of The Whitney Museum of American Art ) . When questioned about this shift by Bruce Glaser in a WBAI-FM , New York broadcast in February , 1964 , Stella replied : There 's always been a trend toward simpler painting and it was bound to happen one way or another . When painting gets complicated , like Abstract Expressionism , or Surrealism , there 's going to be someone who 's not painting complicated paintings , someone who 's trying to simplify ... You 're always related to something and I 'm related to geometric , simpler painting . ( Battcock , 1968 : 149 ) Fellow artist and friend Donald Judd participated in the same radio interview . While his art took a sculptural form and fell neatly into the newly defined category called " Minimalism , " Judd shared with Stella the same concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're getting rid of the things that people used to think were essential to art " ( p. 159 ) . Minimalism was the first sculptural movement to exclude all excess and redundancy , creating some of the most austere work in the history of art . The Minimalists used industrial materials and processes ( art and technology ) and paid special attention to the physical properties of materials and the materials ' expressive , inherent qualities . This emphasis on industrial materials and techniques produced an art that was objective , logical , and intellectual , an art that responded to the urban industrial environment . Donald Judd , who wrote art criticism prior to devoting himself completely to the making of art , composed a widely circulated essay on " Specific Objects " in which he expressed his preference for a literal use of materials , space , and concepts . Judd 's forms were concepts such as " cube ; " his materials were industrial steel and aluminum and were machined to perfection leaving no indication of the human hand ; his art occupied real space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Untitled , 1965 , galvanized iron and aluminum , Collection of The Whitney Museum of American Art ) . This literalism was clearly influenced by the Bauhaus philosophy , which demanded truth and pragmatism . The greater emphasis on the intellectual content of art can also be viewed as a Bauhaus influence , since the new generation of American artists were trained , not in technical art schools , but in universities . Many of these artists were both writing and talking about their work and collaborating with critics who could articulate the new ideas . ( Carl Andre , Mel Bochner , Dan Flavin , Brian O'Doherty , Robert Smithson , Robert Morris , and Sol Lewitt are a few artists who published their ideas . ) Attempting to force the art audience to an awareness beyond the particular art object and to obliterate confusion and misunderstanding about their work , the Minimalists wrote at length about their ideas , their influences , and the forms they found . Here was a difficult , highly intellectual , not particularly charming form of art . Minimalism proved to be even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of essays published regarding it . These obscure references to Gestalt psychology and the writings of the German philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein were lost on the average American . Furthermore , unlike Abstract Expressionist paintings , Minimalist sculpture did not translate well to the popular press . Even heroes like Jackson Pollock were hard to find since most of the work was conceived by the artist and then fabricated by a hired craftsman . The literal trend in American art Another art movement coming at about the same time satisfied the needs of the mass media and in fact mirrored the images created by and for that culture . Pop Art held as its main protagonist the media manipulator and star personality , Andy Warhol . Working in both painting and sculpture , Warhol lifted his images from the commercial world of newspapers , magazines , advertising . There is in the imagery of Pop Art a simplicity necessary for the quick communication required by the commercial world . Warhol was a master of the quick fix , applying the techniques of the advertising industry to the making of high art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the images of Campbell 's soup cans and Brillo boxes to make paintings and sculpture ( Collection of The Whitney Museum of American Art ) . He well understood the success Jackson Pollock achieved as an art celebrity in the popular journals , and therefore orchestrated for himself a public life akin to that of a movie star seen at all the " right " parties and openings ( Warhol and Hackett , 1983 ) . If Americans viewed his art with suspicion and stood convinced that he was exploiting the galleries , museums , and collectors , that was , in the end , acceptable . It made Warhol one of the people , and they smiled while he took the money from the rich , from the fools who praised the emperor 's new clothes . What ties the work of Warhol to that of Stella and Judd is first of all the objective approach and secondly the need for an art context . The paintings of readymade images and machinelike reality were appropriated from mass culture and produced by commercial silk-screening techniques . These depersonalizcd works needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their full impact . It was in that white-walled haven for art exhibition that Campbell 's soup cans became art . The literal qualities shared by Pop Art , Minimalism and the " new " geometric painting caused this art to require a segregated space , away from the urban environment that produced it . The ideal gallery subtracts from the art work all cues that interfere with the fact that it is " art " . The work is isolated from everything that would detract from its own evaluation of itself . This gives the space a presence possessed by other spaces where conventions are preserved through the repetition of a closed system of values . Some of the sanctity of the church , the formality of the courtroom , the mystique of the experimental laboratory joins with chic design to produce a unique chamber of aesthetics . So powerful are the perceptual fields of force within this chamber that , once outside it , art can lapse into secular status . ( O'Doherty , 1986 : 14 ) Minimalism , Pop Art , and Sixties geometric painting were vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the gallery space because of the literal qualities they shared . In the case of Pop Art the imagery was literally that of the world of commerce and advertising . Geometric painting addressed the literal qualities of abstraction . Stella 's WD The American Art Museum shaped canvases ( Sanbornville 111 , 1966 , fluorescent alkyd and epoxy paint , ( Collection of The Whitney Museum of American Art ) bent or cut the painting 's edge according to the internal logic of the composition , making the viewer keenly aware of the painting as a real object with no illusion of space or depth . Minimalist sculpture was exactly what it appeared to be and made no reference to anything outside itself . Judd 's aluminum cubes were actual aluminum cubes , containing no illusion or metaphor . Placed in a secular environment they would easily have been absorbed by that world . Conclusion So it would be that the art propagated by modernism would require a museum designed by modernists . The philosophy of modernism produced , in high art , work that was visually difficult , intellectually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That same philosophy , when applied to solving the problems of exhibiting this art , found solutions that aided the population . The same demands of truth and pragmatism that removed the art from the public realm provided , when applied to architecture and design , democratic solutions . In other words , while modern art was elitist , modern architecture was really democratic . Modernist architecture and design as it was applied to the American art museum was meant to provide a setting for the art and to provide a practical , systematic , instructional space that would , according to Bauhaus law , fulfill its function . ( For the development of the first Museum of Modern Art building , see " Barr as modernist " in Chapter 8 . ) The result was a building that considered practical issues such as traffic flow and lighting ; considered human requirements such as restaurants and rest rooms ; considered what had become the principal concern , the principal function of the American art museum : the education of the masses . Modernism 's architects , teachers , and artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure , had altered the art America produced and altered also the context in which it was viewed . The exhibitions of modernist art strove to be informative and interesting and were frequently coupled with publications explaining the work and its historical precedents ( for example , see " Barr as populist " in Chapter 8 ) . Designers tried to attract and hold the attention of the general public through the pre-exhibition publicity as well as the actual installation . The museum hoped to sustain that interest by way of related lectures and tours and related publications available in the museum shop . ( See also " Barr as capitalist " in Chapter 8 . ) They also hoped to sustain the visit by supplying the comforts afforded by restaurants and members ' lounges . All this grew from the conviction that the art museum was not intended for the few but for the enlightenment and education of the masses . // In America , where democratic ideals were held high and education was not only every person 's right hut also a necessity for the country 's cultural and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center for the enlightenment of the general public was being recognized . The American art museum began to adopt service to the broad community as a goal , and modernist design could provide a logical , instructional focus for the entry of the public into the esoteric world of modern art . Edward Larrabee Barnes , the architect of numerous American art museums including the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh and the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts , spoke to this issue as he discussed his design for the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis : The problem in museum design , I feel , is to focus on the art , and on the way people go through the museum , and not on making an architectural monument ... I was dedicated to the idea of anonymous white spaces ... The question was how to arrange these spaces so that the galleries themselves could become a procession . Usually you think of museums like the Metropolitan , with an enormous Grand Central Station hall , with no art in it ? a sort of stage for pomp and circumstance and then galleries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught up in a succession of white rooms ... The idea is to get people involved immediately with whatever the museum has ... Once in the building , you 're immediately caught up in it , and are thinking of the art ... I feel very definitely that the rooms themselves have to represent calm , well-proportioned spaces . The sequence and the sense of flow must work , and the way you move through it must be graceful . I think it 's a very difficult thing to explain how you can do architecture with a strong central idea , with just as self-centered an idea as any building , and at the same time have that idea opt for this function of bringing out these various shows which go through it . It 's not just an anonymous building ... ( Diamonstein , 1980 : 17 ? 18 ) In conclusion , we see that the modern art museum and the modern art object came to exist in a symbiotic relationship . Most of American modernist art is dependent on the context of the gallery space to fully realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surrealism and the German Bauhaus , much of the art produced since World War II required the viewer to possess information about psychology , mythology , art history , and a specific knowledge of visual language . Because of its literal quality , its reductive tendencies , and its basic abstract nature , it also required the modern gallery space for exhibition . The exhibition space as designed by the modern architect is , in turn , dependent on the art to fulfill its function . The modern art museum can not stand like a palace of culture , aloof and passive , but rather is charged with a very specific task . The modern art museum in a democratic society is charged with the pragmatic presentation of the enigmatic object . 6 Art for the masses : a study of educational practices in American art museums Most of what is shown in any museum is incomprehensible and uninteresting to most of its visitors ... A museum that will truly unlock its treasure to the world must maintain in its service ... men who have studied its possessions sufficiently exactly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all study of art ? the full pure enjoyment of the individual work ... Benjamin Ives Gilman , Museum Ideals of Purpose and Method Introduction Education , as viewed by Americans , is a pillar of democracy , the means to opportunity and advancement for the general population , advancement on intellectual , economic , and social levels . American museums have long been involved in educational pursuits , and many were established with the education of the public as a main mission . ( For the historical overview , see Chapter 2 . ) Art museums in particular were viewed as a means to better citizens : uplifting morals , communicating history , and teaching aesthetics . Key people in key museums wrote and taught their ideas regarding the educational mission of American art museums . John Cotton Dana , director of the Newark Museum in New Jersey from 1909 to 1929 , was a firm believer in the museum as an institution of learning , an institution with exhibits and programs made available to all the people . His ideas were widely published , studied , and practiced ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generally considered to have invented the gallery talk at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston , a method now standard in art museums ( Gilman , 1918 : 312 ) . Thomas Munro , Curator of Education at the Cleveland Museum of Art during the 1930s , 1940s , and 1950s , conducted research regarding learning in museums and was known for his concern for teaching the general population while maintaining high standards ( Munro , 1940 : 18-19 ) . Whether by chance or by design , American art museums took the lead in educational theory and techniques ( Wittlin , 1970 : 150-1 ) . Whole departments for education sprang up in museums across the country . Perhaps more than any other internal force in museum administration , the growth of educational programming reflected the democratic concerns of the museum staff . Education was seen as necessary for the fulfillment of the art museum 's democratic mission . As a way to understand the role of education in the art museum in the American democratic culture , we will look first to the general art museum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will begin with a brief history of education at the Cleveland Museum , considered a pioneer in this field , and then look to a recent survey of four general art museums in the North-East . The comparative survey includes a questionnaire , site visits , interviews , and a review of museum records , including budgets . Education at the general art museum can then be compared to education at the modern art museum by a close look at one contemporary art exhibition at New York 's Museum of Modern Art and the educational effort which accompanied it . Model : the Cleveland Museum The Cleveland Museum of Art has long been recognized for its educational programs , which are considered a benchmark for American art museums . From the time of its founding in 1916 , the Cleveland Museum , reviewing the art of all ages and cultures , had an educational department and a method for reaching the community ( Munro , 1940 : 2-7 ) . The collections of the Cleveland Museum include one of the finest oriental collections in the Western world ; a medieval collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and England ; an excellent assemblage of European and American paintings from the Middle Ages to the present , including outstanding collections of Renaissance , Baroque , and seventeenth-century Dutch painting , nineteenth-century American landscape , and Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works . Today the Cleveland Museum offers studio and art history classes for young people and adults , and lectures for the public by museum curators and visiting scholars . The museum also offers advanced placement courses to Cleveland area high school students and , in conjunction with Case Western Reserve University , undergraduate and graduate courses in art history . ( Unless otherwise noted , all data is compiled from the Cleveland Museum Bulletin and Financial Reports . ) All of this is in addition to the regularly scheduled gallery talks and tours . The museum also publishes many books and catalogs , slides and reproductions . The scholarly Bulletin was published ten times a year up to January of 1995 . It has been replaced by the Members Magazine plus an annual scholarly journal , Cleveland Studies in the History of Art . The Cleveland Museum set down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to various educational levels ( secondary school , university , graduate ) and to adults seeking a serious study of art or a casual " cultural experience . " // In a 1952 publication on the museum 's educational programs , Thomas Munro , then Curator of Education , wrote : The department of education is charged with carrying on a complex program of instruction and guidance throughout the year . This includes work with children and adults ; with schools , organized groups , and individuals . Some of it is on a popular , elementary level , to convey the fundamentals of art appreciation to a large public ; some is on a level of more advanced study , research , and scholarship through post-graduate courses and publication . A constant effort is made to preserve high standards , even while reaching a large audience , and thus to show that mass education does not have to involve a lowering of quality . ( Munro , 1952 : 5 ) The museum 's conscious desire to make art available to a large public , and its concrete commitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resulted in a highly developed education department by 1952 , including 23 full-time staff members , 30 part-time , and eleven volunteers ( Munro , 1952 : 73 , 74 ) . It is important to note that the education department was aware , from the very beginning , of the possible pitfalls inherent in a program geared toward a wide and diverse audience . The danger in developing a program so democratic in its scope was that the content would be reduced to the lowest common denominator . One way Thomas Munro found to help insure a maintenance of high standards was the two-track system of the popular program ( the fundamentals of art appreciation ) and the scholarly program ( advanced research and publication ) ( Munro , 1952 : 33-4 ) . This was based on the belief , or at least the hope , that the staff would constantly be reminded of the true mission of the education department , which was to educate , not entertain , the public and always strive to raise the level of understanding of art . Munro acknowledged that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a " leisure activity , " but one , he maintained , which could be rendered permanently valuable . In learning to perceive a great variety of complex forms and subtle qualities of line , shape , and color , one acquires visual powers which carry over into daily life . They intensify awareness and enjoyment , not only of art itself , but of nature and of life . ( Munro , 1952 : 8 ) And on a broader historical note he added : A study of the visual arts contributes greatly to the general education of the student . They are one of our principal means of understanding the civilizations of the past and the cultural trends of our own day . It is well known that art expresses its age as well as the personality of the individual artist . But it is not an easy task to interpret the different attitudes , beliefs , and interests which are thus expressed ? those , for example , which distinguish the Greek or Chinese culture from our own . ( Munro , 1952 : 8 ) // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department because , as Munro pointed out , the casual observer could not grasp the complex , subtle , or deeper meanings of art without guidance . Track two , the scholarship within the museum , mainly involved the curatorial staff . According to Munro 's plan the curators and librarians would communicate their knowledge and judgement to the education department , which would , in turn , communicate with the public . The curatorial research might also result in publications which would reach a wide audience . In addition to this , the Cleveland Museum established a relationship with Case Western Reserve University and its art department which allowed for university students to conduct research within the museum and provided classrooms for courses conducted by the university . Also , some members of the museum staff served as members of the university faculty . Munro urged the further development of joint publications on art : " through articles , monographs , and books of discussion and scholarship on the highest level , of a permanent value commensurate with that of the museum 's tangible possessions " ( 1952 : 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of the Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism with the Cleveland Museum . Although the publication was owned by the American Society for Aesthetics , and the museum had no legal or financial connection to the publisher , the journal was edited at the museum . All of this , plus a flow of visiting scholars invited to use the collections in research and present their findings in public lectures , contributed to the image of an institution filled with great cultural wealth in the form of objects and knowledge . Combined with the more popular programs of the education department , the image of the Cleveland Museum was that of a dynamic and beneficial agency in the cultural life of the community , reaching out to provide understanding and enjoyment of the permanent collections and special exhibitions ( Lee , 1983 : 110 ) . The Cleveland Museum 's reputation as a leader in art museum education was founded on a strong philosophical base and implemented by a large staff whose programs were generously funded . The Cleveland Museum recognized the importance of education from the beginning , articulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus became the benchmark by which other programs might be measured . With this brief history in mind , let us now consider current educational efforts at other art museums . Education in the general art museum : a comparative survey Four general art museums located in the North-East were surveyed in an effort to determine the developments in public education programs over a 25-year period , including the relationship between these programs and the size of museum staff and budget . The Worcester Art Museum in , w 1 MI American Are M1 HHNI Worcester , Massachusetts ; the Philadelphia Museum of Art ; the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University in Ithaca , New York ; and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City were selected to represent a broad range in size , staff , holdings , budget , and public served . The survey commenced with a questionnaire mailed in January , 1990 . This was followed by site visits , a review of budgets , and interviews . Worcester Art Museum , the collections of which span 50 centuries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution . Egyptian , classical , Far-Eastern , and Renaissance art are represented . European paintings range from fourteenth-century Italian to seventeenth-century Dutch and twentieth-century Cubism . There are pre-Columbian art and American paintings and a substantial collection of Japanese prints . The collection of contemporary works of art is growing steadily . In 1970 , a major addition to the museum , the Higgins Education Wing , was built to house studios for students of all ages . The school also offers classes for college credit in conjunction with the Quinsigamond Community College , the Massachusetts College of Art , and the College of Professional and Continuing Education at Clark University . Another addition provided 20,000 square feet of space for the museum . Between 1970 and 1990 the museum staff grew from 66 to 135 ( full- and part-time ) . The museum reported in the questionnaire 25 full-time employees holding B.A. degrees , eight with M.A. degrees , and three with Ph.D . degrees . Personnel are reported to belong to all professional organizations , to attend professional conferences , and to continue professional training through workshops and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the questionnaire , the museum " continues to provide and maintain a commitment to professionalism . " One striking statistic at the Worcester Art Museum is the dramatic increase in volunteers ( Table 6.1 ) . The museum reported a volunteer force of 175 in 1970 and 500 in 1990 , an increase of 188 percent . The museum budget leaped from $677,850 in 1970 to $4 million in 1990 , approaching $6 million in 1995 . With the increase in staff , space , volunteers and budget , it is surprising to note the decrease in the public served ( Table 6.2 ) . Attendance declined from 150,000 in 1970 , to 120,000 in 1980 , and to 110,000 in 1990 . This situation may be the result of shifting demographics since , as we shall see , the museum is making a serious effort to " diversify " its audience . While much of the budget , space , and staff increases go toward the support of the museum school , the volunteer force is within the museum itself . The museum now has an outreach program servicing local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the museum guided by volunteers . While the number of tours increased , however , the total number of people remained substantially the same . In other words , the tours contained fewer participants . For example , the number of school groups increased 152 percent from 254 in 1970 to 640 in 1990 , but the number of schoolchildren serviced within those groups lux The AMIIHCan Art MAMMON increased by less than 2,000 over the same period , just 2 percent of the total attendance . The number of adult groups being served increased by 138 percent , going from 99 groups in 1970 to 236 groups in 1990 , but the actual number of individuals in those groups increased by less than 700 . In 1994 , Worcester Art Museum received the largest grant in the history of the museum : $1.36 million from the Lila Wallace ? Reader 's Digest Fund for the support of an education project aimed at increasing and diversifying their audience . The " Art of Discovery " project was designed to achieve a " more effective orientation ( to the museum ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with input from a broad group of participants , " specifically the ethnically diverse lower-income urbanites and the economically diverse suburban population . The museum chose its Greek and Roman collections for the project and is focusing on the everyday cultural lifestyles of the period . The program includes collaborations with public schools and special lectures for individuals . At the same time , the museum 's 1995-adopted long-range plan includes the goal of 200,000 visitors by the year 2000 . In pursuit of this goal the museum has introduced programs targeted at specific ethnic groups , ( e.g. the Puerto Rican Film Festival ) launched exhibitions such as " Heritage of the Land " ( the art and culture of native Americans ) and " Mexico : A Landscape Revisited " ( in which the wall labels were bilingual ) ; and established a Diversity Committee composed of representatives from the museum and the community . This committee , according to Museum Director James A. Welu , " is charged with helping our institution achieve diversity among its staff , governing board , programming and audience . In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to become better informed about potential biases concerning gender , race , ethnicity , disabilities and other issues " ( Welu , 1995 : 2 ) . Another dramatic increase in the number of volunteers occurred at the Philadelphia Museum of Art . Like Worcester , the Philadelphia Museum 's treasures come from all parts of the world and range in time from the first century to the twentieth . Its collections of Far-Eastern and Italian Renaissance art are particularly strong . Medieval European art occupies the second floor , and there is an Armory of fifteenth- and sixteenthcentury German , Italian , and English arms and armor . The museum is rich in modern works , thanks in part to the Arensberg collection , which includes the largest group of Brancusi sculpture in America , and galleries of master works by Marcel Duchamp . Philadelphia is a large museum with 250,000 square feet and a 1990 budget of $16 million , up from $3.3 million in 1970 . The 1995 budget approached $25 million , a $5 million increase over 1994 due to the exhibition " From Cezanne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Philadelphia 's exhibition space , personnel , and annual attendance figures reflect a slow , steady growth over the twenty years from 1970 to 1990 as might be expected . // The extreme increase in the 1990 budget should therefore be explained . In 1986 , the Philadelphia Museum undertook a major capital campaign , the landmark Renewal Fund , with the ambitious goal of raising $50 million in private support over a five-year period . Of this amount , $30 million will be allocated for endowment , to build a capital base capable of generating income for operations . Another $15 million will go toward building repairs and improvements , and the remaining $5 million will assist with " increasing operating costs during the campaign period . " In other words , it costs money to raise money . A review of the Annual Report shows increases in gifts , endowment and trust fund income and an increase in revenue from the sale of art objects amounting to $1,393,928 in 1989 over the $47,496 gained two years earlier . The dramatic increase in volunteers at Philadelphia can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Worcester , these new forces are used in educational programs . The number of volunteers is recorded as 150 in 1970 , 180 in 1980 , then more than doubling to 410 by 1990 . This dramatic increase of 173 percent is comparable to Worcester 's 188 percent increase between 1970 and 1990 . And , as at Worcester , the volunteer force provides lectures and tours of museum exhibits . Over the twenty-year period examined , lectures increased 900 percent , tours increased 79 percent . Also , as at Worcester , the number of individuals being served is not in proportion to the phenomenal increase in lectures and tours ( Table 6.2 ) . The Philadelphia Museum reports the number of individuals being served by these services as increasing from 8,181 in 1970 to 9,680 in 1990 . The numbers reported by both the Worcester Museum and the Philadelphia Museum indicate more and more volunteers presenting more and more lectures and tours for basically the same size audience . This curious development will be further addressed later . These two museums , Philadelphia and Worcester , can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North-East , the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City and the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University in Ithaca , New York . The Herbert F. Johnson Museum recorded in the 1990 survey only two volunteers assisting a paid staff of 41 ( Table 6.1 ) . Shortly after the survey was conducted , the museum initiated a volunteer docent program and , as we shall see later , greatly expanded its educational offerings . To begin the program review , we will consider the 1970 to 1990 period and then examine the more recent developments . The museum , named after its prime supporter Herbert Johnson of Johnson 's Wax , was designed by I. M. Pei and is a bold construction of rectangular forms built high on a rise with spectacular views of Lake Cayuga . The poured concrete building houses a broad collection particularly strong in nineteenth- and twentieth-century American painting , and Asian ceramics from China , Japan , Korea , and Southeast Asia . The museum exists primarily as a cultural resource for the Cornell University students but does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These were limited between 1970 and 1990 , as one might expect , knowing there was virtually no use of volunteers . The lack of a volunteer force should be viewed as a significant indicator because , as we have seen at both Philadelphia and Worcester , volunteers are often synonymous with educational programs . Educational programs at Cornell 's museum during this period were in the hands of the professional staff , and traditionally the university museum staff 's main focus has been on research . The museum is , however , a cultural center for Ithaca , an upper New York State town containing no other art museum and with no art resources in the greater region . The annual attendance at the Johnson Museum was reported at a healthy 77,656 for the 1989 ? 90 season ( Table 6.2 ) . The 1994 ? 95 Annual Report notes attendance at 74,000 which , although down from the 1980 and 1990 numbers was , according to Director Franklin Robinson , up 10 percent from the previous year . The introduction , therefore , in 1991 of a docent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Whitney Museum of American Art is comparable in size , at 23,100 square feet , to the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of 22,000 square feet . Designed by the renowned Bauhaus architect , Marcel Breuer , the Whitney is located on a prime corner in Manhattan , Madison Avenue at 75th Street . One should not be deceived by its diminutive size , for the Whitney Museum has been a powerhouse of influence on and beyond the world of American art . Although its physical size is comparable to the Herbert F. Johnson Museum , its 1990 budget was almost ten times that museum 's amount . Compared to the Philadelphia Museum , the Whitney building is less than 10 percent the size of Philadelphia , but its 1990 budget was 67 percent that of Philadelphia and its staff was almost 75 percent of the number of personnel at Philadelphia ( Table 6.2 ) . The Whitney was founded in 1930 by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney , the daughter of the railroad magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt . It has been at its present location since 1966 . Dedicated to American art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid special attention to contemporary American art as its Biennial Exhibition and Lobby Gallery shows attest . It also runs an active film and video program . As a way of expanding its exhibitions and influence , the Whitney , during the decade of the 1980s , moved beyond the museum walls to " branch " museums set up in the lobbies of corporations . Since 1990 , major changes have occurred in both staffing and programs at the Whitney . These will be reviewed in Chapter 7 as we address the role of the corporation in the American museum . For now we will focus on the period from 1970 to 1990 . The Whitney Museum established the first corporate branch by 1980 , and by 1990 the museum could boast four branches funded by corporations for a total of 19,100 additional square feet : the Whitney Downtown at Federal Reserve Plaza ( funded by IBM and Park Tower Realty ) ; the Whitney at Equitable Center ( funded by Equitable Insurance AR /Ot ' WI mania 1 ! s Co. ) ; the Whitney at Philip Morris ( funded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headquarters of Champion International ) . These four branches , while expanding the exhibition space by 19,100 square feet , resulted in a meager show of increase in personnel , from 135 in 1980 to 140 in 1990 ( Table 6.1 ) . This is explained in part by the fact that the corporations supplied the maintenance and security for these spaces , and also by the museum 's use of graduate student interns in curatorial roles . It should also be noted here that the educational programs at the branch museum sites were not comparable to the usual museum offerings . The Whitney Downtown , for example , provided a gallery talk only on Monday , Wednesday , and Friday at 12:30 . The same was true of the Whitney Museum at Philip Morris , which presented changing exhibits in both its indoor sculpture court and adjacent gallery , and the Whitney in Fairfield County , which also presented changing exhibits . The Whitney Museum at Equitable Center consisted of two galleries , one for long-term installations of works from the permanent collection , the other for temporary exhibits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All four branches , with their midday lectures , appeared to be providing a service for the host corporation employees rather than an aggressive outreach program to educate the community . As a means of surveying the educational relationships of art museums to their public and assessing the meaning and motivation of such relationships , two indicators have been identified . The first indicator is the number of people served by a museum . Is the museum fulfilling its democratic mission to provide educational opportunities to the general population ? The second indicator is the number and role of the volunteers in the museum because the strength of the volunteer staff is often indicative of the breadth of the educational program . The research conducted in the four museums profiled indicated a steady attendance or a slight increase in attendance in three of the four museums between 1970 and 1990 . Only the Whitney Museum indicated a dramatic increase in attendance , ( from about one-half million visitors to almost one million visitors per year over a ten-year period ) and this was clearly due to the development of four branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance , or at least interest , is the unprecedented increase in educational program offerings at both the Worcester Museum and the Philadelphia Museum . While Philadelphia reported a 75 percent increase in tours , and Worcester reported more than doubling its number from 353 tours to 876 , neither museum showed a comparable increase in the number of visitors served . So while the research showed increases in the museums ' budgets , staff , and educational programs , no remarkable increase in the number of public served by these programs can be documented . The second indicator selected is the number of volunteers . Volunteers are traditionally employed within educational programs and , in fact , the numbers cited here reflect increases in educational staff . Of the four l z the AM IHCIM An MM/IMMI museums profiled in this report , two were using volunteer docents extensively . Philadelphia and Worcester reported increases by 173 percent and 188 percent respectively in the number of volunteers over a twentyyear period ( 1970-90 ) . These figures reflect the increase in programs , lectures , and tours , while underscoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see connected to the increase in volunteer and paid staff is a growth in educational programs , and in overall operating budget . The prime motive for educational programming must be viewed as a didactic , democratic impulse set in motion by the museum 's mission . It seems evident , however , that there are at least two ulterior motives for museums ' educational programs . The first is the relationship between educational programs and admission charges for a museum . The Philadelphia , Whitney , and Worcester Museums each have an extensive volunteer educational staff and also charge admission . In all three cases , a substantial percentage ( usually 25 percent ) of the museum 's operating budget comes from admission charges and educational programs . The Johnson Museum at Cornell University is not dependent on admission fees ( there is no charge for admission ) and only recently began to develop a volunteer staff , and outreach programs . The implication here is that educational programs help to establish a relationship between the museum and the visitor , and that the growing importance of that relationship to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs . It is in the interest of the Philadelphia , Worcester , and Whitney Museums to draw visitors and to try to encourage return visits . Their budgets require this . The university museum traditionally has had a different priority ( Table 6.3 ) . One additional note is that five other university museums were surveyed , and each of these reported few volunteers , feeble educational endeavors , and budgets not dependent on earned income . University museums , generally subsidized by the university , exist for the cultural enrichment of their students and as a teaching resource for the faculty . In a sense , they are a single track in the Cleveland two-track system . They provide a place for scholarship but have little need to appeal to a broad population . Another indication that there is a relationship between educational Art for tai mama step programs and admission charges can be found in a comparison between the Whitney Museum and both Philadelphia and Worcester Museums . The fact that the educational programs at the Whitney Museum branches were so limited may be because those branches were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As with the university museums , there is no incentive for drawing large crowds nor for cultivating a steady audience . The second ulterior motive for the development of a museum 's educational program is the involvement of the volunteers . We can look at the volunteer as being an individual interested in the museum and knowledgeable about art , who donates a few hours each week in service to the museum . The volunteer might also be a huge multinational corporation donating money and services to the museum for a complex set of reasons ranging from a desire to improve the corporate image in the community , to the fulfillment of a plan for investment in a corporate art collection . Individuals who volunteer in art museums proceed through a comprehensive training program that includes research , reading , lectures , discussions , and hours of observation of practicing docents . All this is no doubt preceded by several months , or perhaps years , on a waiting list . Upon completion of the training program , a docent must usually commit to at least two hours ' service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money is not an incentive , these people are clearly dedicated to art and to the museum . ( Part of the incentive also is the status attached to the art museum . ) A typical profile of the individual who volunteers in the art museum reveals a white female , well-educated , and wealthy , with a broad circle of friends within the same affluent class structure . It is possible that the volunteer 's sphere of influence is as valuable as her contributions of time and money . If we consider the corporation as volunteer , we may recognize that it too has a sphere of influence . The corporation 's role will be examined more thoroughly in Chapter 7 , but let us note here the corporate relationship to the Whitney Museum . The Whitney Museum was limited to 23,100 square feet and an annual attendance of 514,413 people in 1980 . The size of the building precluded any substantial increase in attendance . When the corporations volunteered their 19,100 square feet for Whitney Museum exhibits , they also volunteered their sphere of influence and immediately doubled annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , indicates is that a museum 's educational outreach may be dictated by the financial needs of the institution . Those needs are satisfied in part by the hundreds of thousands of $7.00 admission charges collected from individuals , itself an argument for the democratization of the art museum . The survey also poses the possibility that art museums may reach a visitor saturation point , in particular those museums not situated in major tourist centers . The // increase in volunteers and programs serving basically the same visitor pool will no doubt result in a very well informed audience for art . But museums should be wary of the expansion of exhibits and programs for the purpose of enlarging their audience . The museums surveyed , all general art museums , have educational programs which are also general and follow the traditions established by leaders in the field , such as the Cleveland Museum . Methods for teaching art history , art techniques , and interpretation , were tried and agreed upon over the years . Modern art , however , posed a different set of problems , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge of how to lead a nation to an understanding of and appreciation for the new art forms . Education in the Museum of Modern Art Modern art in the modern art museum : art without recognizable imagery or with imagery distorted ; art inspired by mythology or psychology and dependent on a knowledge of the field of inspiration for full understanding ; art resulting from process and demanding knowledge of the elements of visual language for comprehension . ( The development of American modern art is examined in Chapter 5 . ) Modern art in the modern art museum is not democratic . It requires the viewer to be intellectually , sensually , and emotionally cognizant of visual language , information the average person does not possess . Americans were faced with this new art form , with unrecognizable images executed in a fashion that held no relation to ordinary experience , and the response was generally negative . This was the challenge faced by the new art museum , the Museum of Modern Art . When The Museum of Modern Art opened its doors in 1929 , the established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Paul J. Sachs observed : " We were all , as a matter of course , reading modern literature ; we were listening to modern music ; but in spite of the excitement engendered by the Armory Show of 1913 , our country was , on the whole , antagonistic to modern art " ( Sachs , 1954 : 27 ) . As a matter of fact , at this time not one museum in the City of New York owned a single canvas by Van Gogh , Gauguin , Picasso , Miro , or Klee . The Museum of Modern Art was chartered " for the purpose of encouraging and developing the study of modern arts , " so its educational purpose was established at the outset . Exactly how the study of modern art would be conducted resulted in a course quite different from that of the Cleveland Museum , a course set down by the Modern 's first director , Alfred H. Barr , Jr . ( see Chapter 8 , " Alfred H. Barr , Founding Director " ) . As an undergraduate at Princeton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who taught medieval visual arts as a record of that civilization , combining painting and sculpture with architecture , murals , A ? ! rO ? rfl MaMS illuminated manuscripts , and crafts . Barr used Morey 's idea as a model when he developed , at Wellesley College , the first undergraduate course in modern art offered in American higher education . The course included painting and sculpture and also architecture , film , photography , industrial design , music and theater . This concept was reinforced by a visit to the Bauhaus at Dessau , Germany , where Barr discovered " a fabulous institution ... painting , graphic arts , architecture , the crafts , typography , theater , cinema , photography , industrial design for mass production ... all were studied and taught together in a large new modern building " ( quoted in Hunter , 1984 : 11 ) . Upon his acceptance of the directorship of the Modern , Barr proposed the museum be organized according to a multidepartmental plan based on his Wellesley course in modern art . It was a radical plan , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practical , commercial , and popular arts as well . The fine arts , of course , would lead the way , and the museum opened with an exhibition of paintings by the modern masters Cezanne , Gauguin , Seurat , and Van Gogh . The show was accompanied by a catalog which marked the beginning of the Museum 's publication program , a program envisioned as a way to spread the modernist message ( see Chapter 8 , " Barr as populist " ) . Barr moved on the implementation of the departmental plan and established the Department of Architecture in 1932 with the exhibition " Modern Architecture : International Exhibition " curated by HenryRussell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson . There was also established at this time a Department of Circulating Exhibitions , and the international architecture show traveled throughout the United States . In 1934 , the " Machine Art " show initiated the Design Collection , and in 1935 the Film Library was established , the first department in any museum in the world devoted to this twentieth-century art form . The Department of Photography was founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Museum of Modern Art was the first museum to present photography as art when , in 1932 , it presented the exhibition called " Murals by American Painters and Photographers . " It was also the Museum of Modern Art which organized the first comprehensive photography exhibition in 1937 called " Photography 1839-1937 . " So , in a little more than a decade after its founding , the Museum of Modern Art had reached the goal of being a multidepartmental arts museum . As the critic John Russell described it : The Museum of Modern Art covers not only painting and drawings , but photography , prints and drawings , architecture , design , the decorative arts , typography , stage design , and artists ' books . It has its own publishing house , its own movie house , and its own department of film and video . It has a shop in which everyday objects of every kind may be on sale , provided they pass the Museum 's standard of design . It is a palace of pleasure , but it // is also an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , but in a mysterious , unquantifiable way , you become alert to the energies of modern art . ( Quoted in I turner , 1984 : I I ) The structure Alfred Barr had devised for the museum fostered education by its very nature , it was part school and part entertainment . People would visit to study architecture and then look at paintings ; stop to examine a toaster design and stay for a film preview . Somehow the magic combination worked to draw the public in , and Barr worked to keep them intrigued . In museum publications he talked to them about modern paintings sometimes considered " puzzling , difficult , incompetent or crazy . " He expressed his intention , through these printed materials , to " undermine prejudice , disturb indifference and awaken interest so that some greater understanding and love of the more adventurous paintings of our time may follow " ( Barr , 1943 : 2 ) . Barr 's methods for converting the skeptics included a catalog published in 1932 called A Brief Survey of Modern Painting . While it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at paintings , especially modern paintings , it was appreciated also by the more sophisticated museum visitors . Barr took the reader from familiar , recognizable imagery to more abstract paintings , all the while suggesting meanings and emotions which might be attached to the work . The catalog was clear , concise , to the point , and , as Barr called it , " propaganda in the original and best sense of the word " ( Marquis , 1989 : 216 ) . This little booklet was considered by many to be the most important tract for modern art ever written . Up to this point , no one in the museums or in education had considered converting the masses to modern art . The huge new audience was touched by Alfred Barr 's simple but persuasive prose . In explaining the paintings of Manet ( " pronounced Mangy ' " ) Barr wrote : " He tried to simplify what he saw so that one , large , flat brush stroke might do the work of five . This made the public of the 1860 's laugh at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint in every detail " ( Barr , 1932 ) . So while learning the correct pronunciation of artists ' names ( Ma-tees , Say-zanne ) they were also instructed : " To enjoy the work of these artists it is well to forget prejudices , both modern and old fashioned . Give the picture , itself , a chance to live ! " ( Barr , 1932 ) . Barr believed that the painting collection was the museum 's principal collection and also the most frequently misunderstood . Painting was to be placed in a broader context , was to be viewed with period architecture and design , and with music and poetry , in order to be understood . This special context supplemented by educational material such as A Brief Survey of Modern Painting would be the path to enlightened seeing . So the Museum of Modern Art differed fundamentally at the beginning in its approach to education from general American art museums , in that education was viewed as a curatorial function rather than , as we saw at the Cleveland Museum , a separate endeavor . Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfred Barr , and was viewed as a natural outcome of exhibits supplemented by publications and gallery talks . This approach was a result of the multidepartmental structure of ' the museum , which was a result of modernism being the subject of the museum , not only art as we think of it in the context of the general art museum . As the Museum of Modern Art developed its Department of Education , it did so as a separate enterprise with separate goals and objectives . The Department of Education began as a pilot project in 1937 for the purpose of providing visual teaching materials to high schools in New York City . This was accomplished by one part-time employee ( MOMA Annual Report , 1938 : 4 ) . By 1951 , the program had expanded from supplying ten high schools with materials to supplying 50 high schools . There was also established a People 's Art Center , where children and adults could attend classes in painting , ceramics , jewelry , and woodworking . By this time the staff included a fulltime director , six assistants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department compared to Cleveland . But the purpose of the Museum of Modern Art 's Education Department was quite separate from exhibitions . It provided " creative opportunities to help in the general growth of the child and to satisfy the leisure time interests of the adult , " objectives which could be accomplished independent of the museum ( D'Amico , 1951 : 4 , 7 ) . Late in 1960 , there was established the Institute of Modern Art for the purpose of conducting the art classes formerly sponsored by the Museum . In May , 1984 , the Museum opened the Edward John Noble Education Center , which provides , among other things , a videotape introduction to the Museum and the Guides to the Collection , a series of loose-leaf cards highlighting individual works in the permanent collection which allow the visitor to create a self-guided tour of the Museum . The education department also sponsors gallery talks , study tours , adult surveys of modern art , lectures in conjunction with special exhibitions , and of course the public school programs . The 1994 Annual Report of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the Director , plus five assistants . This can be compared to the Cleveland Museum 's education department , which lists in the 1994 Annual Report a staff of nineteen plus 224 volunteers in education . The Cleveland Museum reported serving 70,615 students in 1994 , while the Museum of Modern Art reported serving 20,000 students . The Modern 's Education Center reported 22,000 visitors in 1988 ( more recent data was not available ) , while the Cleveland Museum reported 140,374 visitors for education programs in 1988 and 154,384 in 1994 . Considering the total operating budget of both museums ( $25.8 million at Cleveland in 1994 , and more than twice that at the Modern , clearly these two museums have different priorities and different approaches . The Museum of Modern Art , continuing in the tradition of Alfred Barr , assumes a role in directing the public 's interaction with the art which is different from " the benchmark " and will now be examined more closely . // Vito Acconci at the Museum of Modern Art : a study A major exhibition of the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art in 1988 . Curated by Linda Shearer , the show contained sculptural works which are as difficult as any art created in this century . A close look at the ways and means of presenting this art to the public will provide insight into the Modern 's philosophy of education . This will be achieved through an interview with the artist in his studio , an analysis of his work in the studio and in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art , and an analysis of the exhibition catalog essay by curator Linda Shearer . Vito Acconci has been a controversial artist since the beginning of his career in 1969 . Trained as a poet , Acconci first combined photographs with words , and then used video and film in more ambitious works in which he manipulated his body as a performance artist . By 1971 , at the age of 31 , sculptural elements were combined in installations with audioand videotapes . The notorious 1972 installation called Seedbed at the Sonnabend Gallery in New York City is an example of his method , materials , and message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space , was constructed so that the viewer would ascend automatically upon entering the space . The artist lay , unseen , under the ramp and carried on a monologue while masturbating . Some gallery visitors were shocked and angered by the content of this and other pieces by Acconci and also confused by the forms the artist invented . Deprived of the familiar categories of painting or sculpture , viewers had no frame of reference for the work . and some thus felt uncomfortable with it . The artist has continued in this vein , attempting always to involve the viewer but at the same time resisting categorization and analysis . He admits to strong democratic tendencies which are invoked in the work , yet the references resulting from his education and intellect are obscure for the average person . Work filled with paradoxes and contradictions presents a great challenge to a curator with an educational mission . We will look first at what is perceived as the problem , that is , the inaccessible nature of the work , and then at the attempted solution , that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artist , the art , and the American modern art museum , will hopefully reflect the elitist/democratic paradox . Vito Acconci says his work is more about culture than it is about art . " As soon as something is called art ' , people who are n't involved in the art world feel very very left out . They immediately feel this is part of a realm they do n't understand . " ( From an interview with Nancy Einreinhofer , January 9 , 1990 . Unless otherwise noted , all quotations of Vito Acconci are from this interview . ) This is why Acconci incorporates in his art images and conventions he considers familiar to the average person . The images are constructed with materials which are readily available and are constructed in an ordinary manner with ordinary tools . Acconci acknowledges that not everyone will understand all the elements of a // piece , but hopes they will at least know the meaning of the prime images and therefore feel familiar with the work and willing to explore it . One example of such an effort is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instant ! louse . Built in 1980 , the piece consists of four eight-feet-by-four wood panels , lying on the floor , one on each of the four sides of a swing . Acconci invites the viewer to participate in the piece by sitting on the swing . Pulleys attached to the swing , the panels , and the ceiling raise the panels , which become walls that enclose the individual in a house-like structure . So it is that the viewer , not the artist , constructs the piece . The interiors of the walls are plastered with American flags , but the person operating the work can not see that the sign of the hammer and sickle of the former Soviet Union has also been raised , attached to the exterior side of the sculpture 's panel . Enticed by something akin to playground equipment , the participant becomes , in one sense , a victim , trapped in the home he has built , unaware of the secret agenda ? propaganda . At the same time , Acconci renders the national symbols of the USSR and the USA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The piece indicates Acconci 's reluctance to adopt an ideological orthodoxy . It also points to the contradictions the artist attaches to the house image . The house is private on the inside , public on the outside . The flags may represent an " us " and " them " mentality . The house means security , shelter , protection , but it is also restrictive . As long as the participant sits on the swing , he is closed off from the rest of the world . Linda Shearer , curator of the exhibition , believes Instant House manifests the acknowledged influence of the architect Robert Venturi , who " favors signage of modernist forms because it is explicit , denotive communication ' . Venturi observes that , in Las Vegas , architecture and signs are often combined , with the facade of a casino acting as one big sign " ( Shearer , 1988 : 5 ) . So we have in Instant House the ordinary images of a swing , a house , and flags , the images Acconci believes " anybody in a particular culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to , the way things shift or collide , but they know what a house is , they know what a window is , they know all the elements , so at least they 're on familiar ground . " We also have the everyday materials the artist feels so strongly about . " I admit this is real important to me . It 's important that the materials used are conventionally available . " Available and able to be assembled by an average carpenter . Acconci detests the notion of the artist as priest , a special person removed from the crowd , chosen to perform a special task . " I think that 's why it is important to me not to emphasize the artist 's hand . The artist 's hand means that this object is something particularly valuable , something that separates the artist from the non-artist . I believe the artist is simply a person who decides to organize certain things . " Acconci , in fact , does not actually build any of his art works . Everything is fabricated by workers . t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r. un " I 'm more interested in popular art , popular music , popular movies , than I am interested in high art . High art is about something hidden . I really want everything to be accessible . When museums say Do not touch ' , they place the viewer in a lower position . The function of Do not touch ' is to make you feel that you do n't own this and somebody else // does . If you can only look at something , you 're in the position of mcrc desire . You can never have it in your hands , you can only stand apart and wish for it . You arc never quite good enough for originals . I think for me those ' 1 ) o not touch ' signs in the museum were a major reason why I started making art . I want my stuff to be touched . " Finally , we have in Instant House the participatory factor . The sculpture actually needs the viewer 's interaction to be what it was meant to be . Vito Acconci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , materials , and presentation . He is , in his heart , a democrat and strives to engage the public . At the same time , the message he sends is not straightforward nor easily explained . He thrives on ambiguity and is willing to undercut social and political conventions as quickly as artistic ones . Faced with a gallery full of works by Vito Acconci , the public is likely to feel angry , challenged , insulted , entertained , or some other mix of confused emotions . As the artist himself admits " I really do n't know how to be interested in any relationship that does n't cause trouble for me and potentially for another person " ( Shearer , 1988 : 5 ) . Linda Shearer , in the catalog which accompanied the exhibition , takes up the difficult task of guiding the audience toward a more complete understanding of the artist and his work . She confirms that Acconci 's work is subjective , and subversive : " In his attempt to rid himself , and us , of the constraints of social and aesthetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eternal wanderer . " Then cleverly adds that " The resulting sense of alienation is essential to the experience of his work " ( Shearer , 1988 : 5 ) . Throughout the catalog essay , Shearer refers to things outside the world of visual art . There is not a single reference to an art historical influence nor to any visual artist past or present . The influences , comparisons , references are all to be found elsewhere . Politics , architecture , history , philosophy , religion and sports , all find a place in the essay . Influential people range from the French philosophers , Roland Barthes and Michel Foucault , to the American filmmaker John Ford , and the comic Lenny Bruce . " Of interest to Acconci has been the theorist Michel Foucault 's identification of the body as a primary metaphor for power . Foucault cited the physical presence of the king 's body in the seventeenth century , and the idea of a social body constituted through a universality of wills in the nineteenth century , as indicating the significance of this concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humor ... has been a persistent element in his Acconci 's work . His early monologues recall the blunt , aggressive wit of the late standup comic Lenny Bruce , as does Acconci 's choosing to behave as transgressor ; as with Bruce , what some saw as obscene was meant as social satire . Few of Acconci 's recent works attempt the sheer preposterousness of such earlier pieces as Trappings , ( 1971 ) , wherein he talked to his penis , which was dressed in doll clothes , and Gang Bang , ( 1980 ) in which huge inflated EU 1d1 A$WflC411 Art MN/IN/PI penises mounted on the roofs of cars chased an inflated breast through Spoleto , Italy " ( Shearer , 1988 : 7 ) . Virtually every theme developed in a work by Acconci finds a reference outside the art world . Game-playing , for example , is " according to Jacques Derrida , associated with anxiety , since it implies that the world does not have a stable , fixed structure . Acconci toys with shifts in meaning and the sense of instability and tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Acconci uses , in an installation piece , mirrors in the shape of body parts , Shearer explains that , according to Jacques Lacan , the mirror stage " represents the child 's first articulation of the concept I ' . At this stage the child , frustrated with its limited motor capacities , believes its likeness to be more perfect than itself . So begins the life-long struggle between image and self-image ; and the early fight for control over oneself also foreshadows a later struggle for power over one 's environment . The mirrors in the forms of parts of dismembered bodies serve as reminders of the underlying violence of these struggles " ( Shearer , 1988 : 9 ) . There is no doubt that Vito Acconci would approve of this attempt to elucidate his art work . As he noted in the interview : " There is this notion that art is pulled out of nowhere . In fact , if you trace the history of an artist you see that the artist exists in a particular time , in a particular place . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe I 'll play around with it . I take ideas from lots of places . Electronics , for example , has something to do with television , something to do with light , something to do with past cultures . So that might be research but it 's still research based on a particular , historically determined , material condition . It 's not pure abstraction . " For Acconci , a large part of the problem with museums and education is the fact that the museum system is built on the idea of the supremacy of the artist . " It seems that there has to be the notion of the artist as some kind of specialized being to allow for the passage from one artist to another and from one group of artists at one time to a group of artists in another world . If the artist was just ordinary , then why is the museum preserving all this work ? " It is this elevated , elitist position of the artist and the art that , according to Acconci , intimidates people and triggers in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be much more adventurous than their taste in art . Why is that ? It 's because they 're not afraid of music , they do n't see it as something that 's supposedly above them . As soon as they think of something as art , we 're in trouble . Then they want it to be this way instead of that way . " Acconci looks forward to a time when art might be considered " not as a separate category , in its own arena and with its own products , but as an atmosphere instilled , almost secretly , within other categories of life " ( Shearer , 1988 : 20 ) . // In the meantime he says , " A real educational system in a museum should talk about the art of a certain time in relation to the architecture of a certain time , the music of a certain time , the theater of a certain time . There should be a mix of categories . It seems that art history should he culture history . " Alfred Barr would have agreed . Conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission of the American museum , regardless of its discipline . The general art museum led the way in educational theory and practice as demonstrated in the profile of the educational programs at the Cleveland Museum . The Museum of Modern Art , under the direction of Alfred Barr , developed a very different approach to informing its visitors , alerting them to modernism in all its forms through a cross-referencing of painting to cinema and sculpture to architecture . Through a comparative examination of four general art museums over a 25-year period , growth patterns and economic trends in educational programming were revealed . Huge increases in budgets and staff were not necessarily matched with comparable increases in visitors served . Likewise , increases in the number of programs offered did not result in increases in the total number of participants . This points to the danger that the museum may be hampered on its present course in fulfilling its mission of education for the masses . If a primary mission of the American art museum is education in a democracy , critical dialogue and alternative views must be offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art and demonstrated here in the review of the exhibition and catalog of the work of Vito Acconci , offers different possibilities to the general art museum and to museums in general . 7 Capitalism and the American art museum : an analysis of the corporate influence They have to raise the funds , they have to create their own identity , they want to be important . Every part of the fabric of the museum is geared toward expansion . The idea is that if we are successful , then we have to grow . And if we grow we need even more money . It is very self-absorbed and self-consuming . " Frank Stella , Museum News Introduction The American art museum born in the nineteenth century was the child of capitalists ( See Chapter 3 ) . This historical fact may account for the ease with which the American art museum of the twentieth century adopted corporate tactics . America 's first museums were founded with private money , and their boards , composed mainly of wealthy capitalists , were modeled after corporate boards . Museums founded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American tradition . Even Andrew Mellon , with his great gift to the nation of a National Gallery of Art to function under the umbrella of the Smithsonian Institution , a federal agency , prescribed a private board for his museum , modeled after the private corporate board and different from the organization of other national museums ( see Chapter 4 ) . The corporate ? museum relationship manifests itself , not only in the profile of the museum board of trustees , but also in the sponsorship of special exhibitions , in the commercialization of those exhibitions and in the production and marketing of their related materials such as books , posters , catalogs , and videos . An examination of the corporate influence and the particularly rapid growth of that influence during the 1970s and 1980s will be reviewed beginning with the Metropolitan Museum under the directorship of Thomas Hoving , whose revolutionary adoption of corporate moneygenerating methods came to be known in the museum world as " Hovingism . " This will be followed by an analysis of the work of artist Hans Haacke , who , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recognition in the art community as the conscience of the American art museum in its corporate dealings . Case studies of two American art museums closely associated with corporate tactics , the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Guggenheim Museum , will he reviewed as a way to identify the benefits and possible pitfalls in the museum ? corporate partnership . Thomas Hoving and the corporate ? museum partnership The peak post-war year for the American economy was 1968 , when American industrial production was more than one-third of the world total . It was also the year that marked the beginning of serious spending by American corporations on the arts , spending that increased in an unprecedented manner through the 1980s . Thomas Hoving began his position as director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art that same year and thrust that museum into the age of corporate sponsorship , sponsorship which would result in the museum 's subsequent adoption of certain corporate policies , techniques , and procedures . Beginning at the Metropolitan with Hoving , the corporate ? museum partnership soon spread to other museums . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must understand its genesis . Thomas Hoving , director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1967 to 1977 , adopted the ways of the corporate world and instituted programs with a keen eye toward the art museum visitor as consumer . More than any other director in the history of American museums , Hoving revolutionized museum operations and the public 's perception of the museum and turned the Metropolitan into New York City 's premier tourist attraction . Under Hoving , the Metropolitan developed a master plan ( MMA , 1968 : 55 ) which included building five new wings , enlarging exhibition areas by one-third ; planning special exhibitions promoted among the masses through popular appeal devices ; and hosting gala parties attended by movie stars and rock stars along with the more usual celebrities , another publicity ploy to catch the national headlines . This new director soon became a household name , no small feat for a museum director , and " Hovingism " came to be identified with a specific set of operational policies . Thomas Hoving was the son of the Swedish immigrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Princeton University , where he received his doctorate in 1959 , Hoving specialized in medieval studies . That same year , at a symposium on art history held at the Frick Collection , Hoving met James J. Rorimer , then director of the Metropolitan . Rorimer recruited Hoving as an assistant curator , and in time Hoving became his protege , succeeding to Rorimer 's former position as chief curator of The Cloisters . In 1965 , Hoving 's good friend John V. Lindsay was elected mayor of New York City . Hoving had prepared Lindsay 's campaign paper on city park policies and so the mayor-elect invited him to assume the position of parks commissioner . Surprising I l 1m , rr , an rf lu urn most people and disappointing his mentor Rorimer , Hoving accepted the appointment ( Tomkins , 1989 : 346-50 ) . Hoving served as commissioner of parks for only one year , but during that brief time his populist approach delighted the media . Hoving closed off Central Park to automobiles on weekends and staged " happenings " which filled the park with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festivals , sporting events , and public " paint-ins " on a mile-long roll of paper . Hoving , as park commissioner , generated more excitement and publicity than anyone else in the Lindsay administration . As park commissioner , Hoving served as an ex-officio trustee on the Metropolitan 's board . In his nine months at that post , he missed only one meeting and understood , therefore , the workings , problems , and plans of the museum . When James Rorimer died suddenly in 1966 , Thomas Hoving was prepared to present to the trustees ' search committee something no other candidate for the job had : a long-range plan for the Metropolitan Museum and an outline of solutions to the museum 's immediate problems ( Hoving , 1993 : 32 ) . On December 28 , 1967 , at the age of 36 , Thomas Hoving was introduced to the staff of the Metropolitan Museum as the newly appointed director . I Hoving 's influence on exhibition policy became immediately apparent . Special exhibitions were events to be promoted in the press , thus increasing museum attendance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . By 1972 , Hoving had tripled the number of exhibitions presented under the directorship of James Rorimer , to a grand total of 62 shows for the 1972 ? 73 season ( MMA , 1973 : 17 ? 22 ) . The pace was frantic , with short lead-times resulting , by some accounts , in sloppy scholarship . The cost was unprecedented , but so were the revenues generated . For example , the 1965 Annual Report cites two major sources of income for the museum : the New York City contribution of almost $1.4 million toward guarding and maintenance ( 25 percent of the total income ) and the income from the museum 's endowment , $3,883,873 , which constituted 66.9 percent of the total . By 1976 , " Hovingism , " taking the form of admission charges , museum shop sales , restaurant and parking charges , and membership dues , had generated $16,334,000 , or 58.9 percent of the operating budget of $27,777,000 ( MMA , 1976 : 81 ? 91 ) . Less than 10 percent ( $2,678,000 ) was contributed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endowment . This $16,334,000 annually was dependent on the blockbuster shows which were the centerpiece of Hovingism . They were the grand and brilliant invention of Hoving because , not only did they generate this huge // income by attracting hordes of people to the museum , but they were also substantially self-supporting ventures because they attracted support from corporations , foundations , and arts councils . The museum 's 1976 annual financial report indicates that every special exhibition was supported by endowment grants or corporate money , usually corporate money . The corporate sponsors wanted the world to know about their good deeds and inserted their publicity methods into the museum . Hoving , of course , adopted them happily , referring to his middle initials , P. F. ( Thomas Pearsall Field Hoving ) as standing for " Publicity Forever " ( Hoving , 1993 : 26 ) . The hectic pace , the changing exhibitions , the crowds and commercialism , disturbed more than a few people . Hilton Kramer , art critic for the New York . Times during this period , wrote that In everything from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproductions , the Metropolitan in the Hoving era has led the way in erasing a precious distinction ? the distinction , after all , that is the museum 's very reason for being ? between the authentic and the unauthentic in art . This is what Mr. Hoving has taken away : our confidence that the museum can be completely trusted to defend the interests of high art . ( Kramer , 1985 : 322 ) Dissent grew within the museum as well and finally became public in 1975 when the head of the department of European paintings , Anthony M. Clark , resigned his post . His letter of resignation charges that Hoving 's exhibition policies and " frantic loans " placed the museum 's permanent collection at risk . Clark refers to Hoving 's regime as one of poor reputation , big on " hucksterism " and lacking in honesty , simplicity , professional grace and skill ( Meyer , 1979 : 116 ) . In the professional museum world there was also great concern and seemingly endless debates at professional meetings and in professional journals regarding the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News article by Lawrence Wheeler , for example , refers to " Club Met , " a nickname earned by the venerable Metropolitan since it made both its reputation and its facilities available to corporations willing to pay the price . The Whitney , with branch museums in corporate headquarters , " sometimes is chided as the ' McDonald 's of the museum world ' . " As far back as 1972 Sherman E. Lee , then director of the Cleveland Museum of Art , expressed his concern in Museum News . He warned that art museums may be compromised or adulterated by their eagerness to please the public . In an obvious reference to Hoving and the Metropolitan , Lee writes : " If an 1870 charter , written with solid Victorian moral uplift , mentions the elevation of public taste , it does not necessarily follow that abortive , yet symbolic , attempts at mass education in 1970 can be really achieved by an art museum rather than other , larger and more pervasive institutions or processes . Playing at education may well be worse than no education at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and criticism , Thomas Hoving and his " corporate tactics " changed forever the public face of the American art museum . Thomas 1 loving and the Metropolitan were perhaps the first to travel the corporate route , but that move quickly became a trend pursued by museums across the country . American art museums founded by America 's wealthy industrialists , merchants , and bankers , were amenable to that world and willingly assumed the corporate mantle . The influence resulted in profound changes both in the organization of the museum and in its function . The 1970s witnessed major changes in board profiles and in the character of museum directorships . The apparent ease with which the shifts occurred can perhaps be attributed to the capitalistic mark left by the likes of Morgan , Frick , Carnegie , Rockefeller , and Guggenheim . American capitalists fashioned their museums , to some extent , after a corporate structure . An examination of the corporate influence will demonstrate how that influence can manifest itself in the profile of the museum board of trustees , as well as in the corporate sponsorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate headquarters as museum outposts . The close working relationship between corporate people and museum personnel in all of the above designations has caused the transfer of corporate management techniques and corporate thinking to the museum staff . This is surely a mixed blessing for while , on the one hand , it seems to provide balanced budgets and fiscal responsibility , it may also threaten the integrity of the art museum . Hans Haacke and the corporate ? museum partnership The museum and the corporation , two very important institutions in the world of art , institutions wielding significant social , political , and economic influence , captured the attention of the artist Hans Haacke in the 1970s and have provided the grist for his mill ever since . No discussion of the relationship between the American art museum and the corporation will have credibility without the input of Haacke . Haacke 's art work functions as a critique of these institutions and hopefully , as a catalyst for change . The following analysis is based on the artist 's work as a primary source and an interview with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a recipient of fellowships from the Fulbright and Guggenheim foundations and from the National Endowment for the Arts , has been an exhibiting artist since the 1960s . His early work focused on processes , situations , and open systems which communicated with their environment . He expanded his interest to social and political systems because of a belief in his artistic responsibility to engage the world as a whole . His early work in systems theory provided a theoretical base for this new direction . The work explores the relationship between the art world and the larger economic and political community because , as Haacke // expressed iii the interview , the social atmosphere , and mental and emotional climate , are affected by what people hear , see , or take in by osmosis from the art world . Hans Haacke 's art work incorporates the traditional media of painting and sculpture with language , photographs , found objects , invented objects and any other media necessary to communicate his ideas , which are steeped in history and politics and which reflect on social systems . In 1968 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reputation as an artist was also high . That year his work could be viewed in museums across the United States : the Museum of Modern Art in New York ; the Milwaukee Art Center ; the Museum of Modern Art , Chicago ; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art ; Albright ? Knox Art Gallery , Buffalo . Hans Haacke was invited for a one-person exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York , the exhibition to take place in 1971 . A few weeks before its planned opening , the exhibition was canceled because of the extremely controversial issues raised by the work . Chief among those art works was Haacke 's now famous Manhattan Project : Shapolsky et al . Manhattan Real Estate Holdings , A Real-Time Social System , as of May 1 , 1971 ( Collection of the artist , New York City ) . The proposed piece consisted of a wall-size chart itemizing the buildings controlled by one major Manhattan landlord . Haacke charted the holdings through the use of maps , architectural photographs and typed data sheets . The 142 buildings included a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guggenheim did not wish to be associated because the piece might not only precipitate an inspection of Shapolsky 's real estate maneuvers , but also call to mind the museum 's physical space , social position , and ideological tenets . Haacke believed , as he communicated in the interview , that the museum feared it would emerge as a place occupying a position of material privilege in relation to other terrains . As Haacke clarified in his notes accompanying the presentation , the Shapolsky group were the largest real estate holders in Harlem and the Lower East Side , investing in housing in impoverished neighborhoods and gaining huge profits through frequent sales and exchanges . Shapolsky emerged , as Haacke researched public records , to be the key figure in a group of about 70 different corporations . Haacke recorded not only the information on the property , but also information on the corporations holding titles . Charting the business transactions , Haacke listed the corporations in columns and traced the exchange of mortgages and properties . What is revealed is a system of family ties and dummy corporations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which profits are made by slumlords . The system is an open one and radiates out to include rental agencies , city agencies , religious , and church groups . Following the cancellation of the show , newspapers , art journals , television , and radio programs discussed the event in the light of // censorship . Thomas Messer , then director of the ( Guggenheim Museum , acknowledged that Haacke 's work " posed a direct threat to the museum 's functioning within its stated and accepted premises " ( Messer , 1971 : 4 ) . Those accepted premises then came to be questioned . What of the role of the museum as sanctuary , as separate , protected place ? When the curator of the exhibition , Edward F. Fry , defended the works publicly , he was fired by the museum . Demonstrations protesting the cancellation of the show and the dismissal of the curator followed , and commentaries included speculations on linkage between museum trustees and the Shapolsky real estate group . No such linkage was ever proven , but the event spotlighted the museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haacke 's portrayals of the corporate ? museum relationship . " There is a direct link between the museum board and the corporate world , " asserts Haacke , " Invariably , more and more corporate representatives come on to the boards , not necessarily because their corporations have been putting in more money , but because they can easily grease the wheels of their peers . " ( From a Nancy Einreinhofer interview with Hans Haacke , February 11 , 1991 . All quotations of Haacke are from this interview unless otherwise noted . ) In 1974 , Haacke created a work of art entitled Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum Board of Trustees in which he traced the interconnections among members of the Guggenheim family , other museum trustees , and various corporations frequently sharing the same addresses and offices . For example , a Guggenheim family member and two trustees were listed on the board of directors of the Kennecott Copper Corporation . The Guggenheim family was represented on the board by Peter O. LawsonJohnston ( president of the board ) , the son of Barbara Guggenheim ; his daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; Michael F. Wettach , another son of Barbara Guggenheim ; and the Earl Castle Stewart , son of Elenor Guggenheim . Barbara and Elenor Guggenheim , daughters of the founder , also served on the board at the time . What the Haacke Guggenheim Board piece reinforces is the fact that the Guggenheim Museum and many other American museums are what Haacke calls " family museums " and they are funded primarily by family money and corporate money . Key positions in those museums are held by members of the family of the founders . They are not accountable to anybody . The regents may have to OK the charter of the museum , but only if there are flagrant violations of the public trust is there any interference from public authorities . So in many ways , they can do as they please . The major bulk of finances also comes from private sources . Large corporate contributions started sometime in the 60 's . Those corporations very often have representatives on the boards , so there 's a direct link to the corporate world . 1.14 Tat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the museum board 's relationship with the corporation culminated in an installation titled On Social Grease , exhibited at the John Weber Gallery in New York City . The installation consisted of large magnesium plaques engraved with public quotes by prominent museum trustees and others regarding the relationship of the museum to business . David Rockefeller , for example , was serving at the time both as chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank Corporation and as the vice-president of the Museum of Modern Art . Rockefeller 's quote , excerpted by Haacke from the New York Times , reads as follows : From an economic standpoint , such involvement in the arts can mean direct and tangible benefits : It can provide a company with extensive publicity and advertising , a brighter public reputation , and an improved corporate image . It can build better customer relations , a readier acceptance of company products , and a superior appraisal of their quality . Promotion of the arts can improve the morale of employees and help attract qualified personnel . The then president of the Metropolitan Museum , C. Douglas Dillon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Business : Perhaps the most important single reason for the increased interest of international corporations in the arts is the almost limitless diversity of projects which are possible . These projects can be tailored to a company 's specific business goals and can return dividends far out of proportion to the actual investment required . What On Social Grease illustrates is that those corporate people serving on museum boards can and do articulate the benefits of sponsorship to their colleagues in the corporate world . There is a shared language and cultural context the multinational corporations understand and are teaching to museums through the museum 's board members . This situation is aptly described in the remarkably candid text of the brochure distributed to corporations by the Metropolitan Museum : Many public relations opportunities are available through sponsorship of programs , special exhibitions and services . These can often provide a creative and cost effective answer to a specific marketing objective , particularly where international , governmental or consumer relations may be a fundamental concern . The flyer contained a page of quotes from business executives telling their colleagues why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Metropolitan Museum is presenting itself to the corporation as a stage on which the corporation 's interests can be promoted . According to Hans Haacke the museum is presenting itself also as an " agent to influence public policy . " Haacke asserts that the museum is telling the corporation that it can he used for a political campaign , to influence legislation . " Thcsc tax cxcmpt institutions become lobbying enterprises . The art they show is instrumentalized to push a corporate interest . " In the case of the oil companies , for example , I laacke believes that both Mobil and Exxon , the two giants of the oil industry , are interested in casing environmental legislation . This can be achieved , in part , by what Mobil calls " a good will umbrella . " Even the fact that museum visitor profiles reveal the majority of art museum-goers to consider themselves politically liberal , fits into the corporate strategy . " It is the liberals in particular who need to be greased , " says Haacke , " because they are the most likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions of influence " ( Haacke , quoted in Wallis , 1986 : 70 ) . Corporations now understand , says Haacke , that the association with the high prestige of art can function as a subtle but effective means for lobbying in the corridors of government . " It can open doors , facilitate passage of favorable legislation , and serve as a shield against scrutinizing and criticism of corporate conduct " ( p. 69 ) . Haacke details this corporate strategy and titles the piece The Good Will Umbrella ( Collection of the artist , New York City ) . First exhibited at the Max Protetch Gallery , Washington , D.C. , in May of 1976 , the work consists of six large panels on which the familiar red and blue Mobil logo has been silkscreened . Under each logo are facsimiles of pages from a speech delivered by Herb Schmertz , Mobil 's vice president for public affairs , to the Eastern Annual Conference of the American Association of Advertising Agencies . The rationale for Mobil 's sponsorship of cultural programs is explained in phrases such as : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project the company 's executives as " corporate statesmen " who are therefore entitled to be " listened to on vital public policy issues . " They also " provide the opportunity to form useful alliances and valuable contacts " with government leaders . The importance of good relations with those who control legislation was underlined in a 1988 Museum News roundtable on " The Museum and the Corporation . " Sandra Ruch , the manager of Mobil 's division of Cultural Programs and Promotion stated bluntly : I need to rethink everything . I present to my management in a completely different way , with a different vocabulary , because there is a new form of management . At Mobil , we have people who want to justify corporate support in two areas , and they are very specific : What can it do for the company in marketing terms , and what can it do for the company in terms of political or governmental relations ? ... My job , as a person trying to mediate between the corporate world and the museum world , is to justify that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is specifically oriented to the fact that we are a multinational company . We do things which are totally related to our operations . , .. m I FM Mn/rfcan AFT AINII It should be noted thin Sandra Ruch was addressing the museum community , telling potential applicants what is expected from them and their proposals . Haacke believes the corporate sponsors " set the tone " for exhibitions . " The museum director and the curator can anticipate what would fit into the corporate picture , they know what would attract corporate funding . Accordingly , the show is styled or the topic chosen . " Corporate public relations officers know that the greatest publicity benefits can be derived from a high-visibility event , those art exhibits that draw large crowds and are covered extensively by the media : the blockbuster exhibition . As charitable agendas go , museum underwriting of special exhibitions has been a sure bet for corporations because of the visibility factor . " When we sponsor an exhibit that runs eight or ten weeks , our corporate name is advertised longer than with most other philanthropic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glennon , 1988 : 39 ) . The special exhibition , in other words , gives the corporation more bang for the buck , a situation smiled on by shareholders . " It 's their money , " says the CEO of Philip Morris Corporation , " and we 're trying to use it in a way that helps our business . We ca n't be totally altruistic without being irresponsible with somebody else 's money " ( Glennon , 1988 : 41 ) . Chase Manhattan Bank , the third largest bank in the United States , at the time had its headquarters in the art capital , New York City , and had as its chief executive , until his retirement in 1981 , David Rockefeller . We have seen briefly Rockefeller 's ties to art and his sympathies regarding corporate sponsorship of museum programs , sympathies which continued at Chase after his departure . We will now look at the Chase involvement with one special exhibition and the " visibility " it provided . The special exhibition held at the Guggenheim Museum in 1988 featured works of art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guggenheim Museum in New York and the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice , Italy . " Fifty Years of Collecting " celebrated the anniversary of the Guggenheim Foundation and was sponsored by Chase . In the sponsor 's statement at the front of the exhibition catalog , Chairman of the Board , Willard C. Butcher writes : " Sponsoring this presentation is just one way we are continuing Chase 's partnership with the arts , which has been going strong for thirty years through our philanthropic contributions and our corporate art collection , which contains many works by the artists represented here " ( Butcher , 1987 : 7 ) . The bank devised a promotional campaign that included the usual vehicles of exhibition catalogs , posters , newspaper and magazine advertisements , and radio spots , but some new and inventive tactics as well . For example , the bank 's automatic teller machines were programmed to display and then print an announcement of the exhibition . In addition , news of the exhibition was slipped into customers ' bank statements and credit card statements , and Chase cardholders were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign were clear to the museum since the exhibition generated the highest attendance in the Guggenheim 's history for a comparable time span ( Guggenheim Annual Report , 1987 : 9 ) . As Haacke says , " The corporate blanket is so warm . " What has evolved from the museum ? corporate partnership , Haacke describes as a form of addiction . The museums have taught the lay public to look for excitement . They have dressed up the notion of art and now the public at large expects something sexy . So the museum has to create extravaganzas , which are expensive . They 're under pressure to deliver in order to attract the people . It 's like an addiction . You start small then you need more , you need bigger doses . In order to attract the crowds and also to attract the corporate support , blockbusters have become necessary . No museum has ever accused a corporate sponsor of censorship , but indeed , censorship is the prime concern among those who consider the museum ? corporate partnership . The risk involved in museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trying to please the corporation and guarantee future funding , propose only attractive , popular shows . This form of self-censorship could threaten the very heart of museum scholarship as esoteric projects are set aside in favor of those with wide appeal . This risk is well understood by museum directors . J. Carter Brown , as Director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington , considered his museum to be " very lucky " in receiving corporate funding and moved to " enlarge the circle . " " Museums have to understand how to make their approach and have to realize they have to put it in terms that will help their people sell that concept further up the line . Just sitting around expecting everyone to realize how significant their project is in cultural terms may not do it . " Brown also saw clearly that the selection of projects which could be easily " sold " might eliminate projects which prove more difficult . Even if the corporations are not involved in any kind of interference in curatorial decisions , like which objects to put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat of the subtle kind of censorship that follows the decision the museum makes as to what to do . If financial backing to do a project is needed , and if from the beginning the museum people realize that it is the kind of project that nobody is going to want to back , this lack of any interference with a curatorial decision is subtly , by default , interfering with a curatorial decision . ( Brown , 1988 : 48 ) In a more adamant analysis of the situation , Philippe de Montebello , Director of the Metropolitan Museum , described corporate funding as " an inherent , insidious , hidden form of censorship " ( quoted in Glennon , 1988 : 42 ) . Perhaps not always hidden . In 1984 , Mobil Corporation succeeded in pressuring the Tate Gallery to suspend the distribution of the catalog of 13t The American Art Museum I laps Haacke 's one-person show at that museum . The corporation took issue with Haacke 's art work and an interview with the artist which appeared in the publication . Mobil charged that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logo in the art works and threatened that the Tate Gallery " will make further distribution of the offending material at their risk and peril . " Mobil had sponsored an exhibition at the Tate which closed the day before the Haacke exhibit opened . After almost one year , the Tate Gallery released the Haacke catalog . The Mobil/Tate incident was documented by Haacke in a collage containing the letter , 471/4 ' x 7214 " , first exhibited at the John Weber Gallery , New York , May , 1985 . Richard Berglund , as head of cultural affairs at IBM Corporation , stated that his company wants to know exactly what will be in an exhibition before they agree to sponsor it . We want to see a checklist ... If there is the possibility that something is going to go off in areas that the company could not live with , then we stay away from it " ( Morfogan , 1988 : 48 ) Case study I : the Whitney Museum Perhaps no other art museum had so completely cast its lot with the corporation as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiveyear period from 1981 to 1986 , the Whitney established branch museums on the premises of four corporations : the Whitney at Fairfield opened in 1981 , funded by and located in the headquarters of Champion International ; the Whitney at Philip Morris opened in 1983 and was funded by Philip Morris Corporation ; the Whitney Downtown at Federal Reserve Plaza , relocated in 1986 , was funded by IBM and Park Tower Realty ( it was originally funded by the Lower Manhatten business community ) ; the Whitney at Equitable Center , established in 1986 , was funded by Equitable Insurance Company . The arrangement provided a total of 19,000 square feet of additional exhibition space for the museum , all operating expenses paid by the host corporation , a tremendous amount of publicity for the museum plus exposure of the museum 's collections , and generous donations annually from the corporations to the " mother " museum . The arrangement appeared on the surface to be a good thing for the Whitney Museum , but a deeper examination is warranted . Two serious threats to museums posed by corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curators proposing exhibitions for corporate underwriting in an attempt to please the sponsoring corporation ; and the danger of cost-effective procedures interfering with quality curatorial time and undermining scholarship . The Whitney Museum 's programs can be viewed in light of these threats . Tom Armstrong served as the director of the Whitney Museum for sixteen years ( 1974 ? 90 ) and during that period of time took the museum to a highly influential position in the art world . Originally dedicated to American art of all periods and media , the Whitney , under Armstrong , changed its mandate to focus on the presentation of contemporary American art and built a collection of the American avant-garde . Under Armstrong 's direction also , the museum worked agreements with four corporations to establish the branch museums . Contemporary art and the corporation were related in the eyes of Tom Armstrong . " The Whitney Museum has a product that most museums do n't have , " he said in a 1986 interview published in Museum News . " We represent contemporary art " ( Keens , 1986 : 28 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and through corporations , Armstrong 's language echoed that of the sponsors . If Philip Morris went to McCann Erickson and said , " We want our name in the newspaper for ten times each month " , McCann Erickson might say , " That will cost you $150,000 a month " . Well , we do that , we put that corporation in a context that their product ca n't , in the editorial content of the press . We 're also allying them with a situation that is noncommercial , beneficial , all of the things that a product-oriented company ca n't really achieve . The prestige that we bring to them is significant , and we want to be compensated for that . ( Keens , 1986 : 26 ) The most ambitious of the branch projects was the deal struck with the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States . The director of Equitable 's real estate , Ben Holloway , initiated the Whitney Branch project because " we think it will attract and hold tenants , and that they 'll pay us the rents we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . In other words , contemporary art serves to make this Seventh Avenue business address even more fashionable . " We were courted by Equitable " brags Armstrong . We 're being courted all over the country . We 've got a winner here . If someone calls me and says , " Mr. Armstrong , I 'm developing a building and I want a branch , " then I say " Have you got $400,000 a year to spend , plus start-up costs ? " Either you play the game or it does n't work . " ( Keens , 1986 : 26 ) The Whitney would not release figures in regard to its corporate branches , and the branches were not a part of the museum 's annual financial report , but it is confirmed that the arrangement included direct expenses , reimbursement of overhead , and a generous contribution to the museum , above and beyond branch-related expenses . For an additional fee , the museum 's curators would advise the corporation on the purchase of art for its collection . Whitney curators , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public spaces at the Equitable Center . In an era of heightened consciousness regarding public relations , imagebuilding has become the incentive for patronage , and the Whitney 's director understands this . " We represent decision-making about quality n , Mnt-tcan Art M WNNII and creativity in our culture " ( Keens , 1986 : 28 ) . The actual image of quality and creativity conjured up by the exhibits mounted , and subsequently transferred to the sponsoring corporation , was definitely in the eye of the beholder . An informal survey conducted in the lobby of the Equitable Center revealed that passers-by were generally enthusiastic about the Roy Lichtenstein giant Mural With Blue Brushstroke which hangs there . Comments included approval of the " upbeat , with-it image " it lent to the building and the fact that it identified the building . ( No need to give visitors the formal address . ) However , of the 30 pedestrians randomly surveyed , none were able to identify the mural 's maker by name , and only three had ever ventured into the adjacent gallery to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey , conducted among people who regularly visit museums and galleries , revealed that , of the 30 people questioned , only four had ever been to a Whitney branch museum . Those four had visited the Equitable Center both to see the Lichtenstein mural and to satisfy a curiosity regarding the corporate ? museum relationship . None of the 30 considered the exhibits mounted at the branch museums to be of much interest . The consensus reached after reading the title of the exhibit and the list of participating artists was that neither the objects nor their context was new . Stimulating ideas are offered in shows all over New York City , creating a highly competitive market for art exhibits . An objective accounting of the activities at the branch museums for the 1988 ? 89 season revealed that each branch presented five exhibitions that year except for Philip Morris , which presented four shows . ( The following statistics were compiled from the Whitney Museum 's Annual Reports . ) The Whitney Museum Downtown at Federal Reserve Plaza was unique among the branches in that exhibits presented there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum Independent Study Program . ( The program was supported by the Helena Rubinstein Foundation . ) Under the supervision of Whitney Museum staff , ten Fellows , undergraduate and graduate students from universities throughout the world , developed and implemented exhibition proposals . Working in teams of four , the Fellows selected the work to be exhibited , designed the installation , wrote the essay for the accompanying brochure , and coordinated publicity . Four of the five exhibits presented at the Federal Reserve Plaza branch were organized by Rubinstein Fellows . All were thematic exhibits , exploring some aspect of American art in a broader art-historical context . " Convulsive Beauty : The Impact of Surrealism on American Art , " for example , explored the influence of European Surrealism through the ideas of automatism , biomorphism , dream imagery , and the unconscious . Thirty-eight artists were represented by 67 paintings , sculptures , drawings , and photographs . Both the theme and the works presented indicate an in-depth research project . Exhibitions at the other three branches were curated by the directors of those branches or were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curated two exhibitions and borrowed three . At Fairfield , the director curated one exhibition and borrowed four . At Philip Morris , three shows were curated by the director and the fourth show was borrowed . An overview of the exhibitions at these three branches indicates that the total of fourteen shows were composed of five painting exhibitions , three photography exhibitions , two drawing exhibitions , and one exhibition containing a mix of media . This was a good representation of artists ' media . Thematically , the fourteen shows provided a look at social history ( six ) and formal art issues ( two ) . Four exhibitions covered portraiture and/or the human figure , and one took nocturne as its theme . Only one of the fourteen shows is based in art history and involves serious research , and that one was developed at the Federal Reserve Plaza branch by Rubinstein Fellows and subsequently traveled to Fairfield . Nine of the fourteen shows were composed of works of art with representational imagery , and the remaining five contained a mix of realism and abstraction . The issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly was not being addressed in any of the three branch museum programs in any coherent way . With the exception of the work of the Rubinstein Fellows at Federal Reserve Plaza , the programs were not concerned with scholarship but rather served as outreach for the museum . The nature of the exhibits may very well indicate selfcensorship . The shows were nonconfrontational , not controversial , easily digested along with lunch , easily accessible for the average person , and presented a contemporary , upbeat image for the corporate sponsor . A comparison of these branch programs and the program of exhibitions at the main site on Madison Avenue should provide further insight . Eleven shows were presented at the Whitney Museum during the 1988 ? 89 season . Of the eleven , eight were originated by Whitney curators , one by Whitney Fellows , and two were borrowed from other institutions . According to media , the shows divided into : three painting , three sculpture , one photography , two architecture , an exhibit of folk art paintings and assorted objects , and the " Biennial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eleven exhibitions were one-person shows . Of the nine exhibitions of fine art , four were of abstract work , three dealt with figuration , and two were a mix of recognizable and abstract imagery , predominantly abstract . The Whitney Museum program consisted of major exhibitions , which occupied a full floor of the museum and were accompanied by a publication , and small undocumented exhibitions held in the Lobby Gallery . The mix from this perspective was seven major shows , four shows in the Lobby Gallery . Of the seven major shows , four were organized by the four Whitney curators ( one each ) , two were borrowed , and the seventh , the " Biennial , " was a joint effort of four curators . So the main museum program was a good mix of media , a solid representation of the more difficult art , and an even distribution of curatorial responsibility . One glaring hole in the program is the absence of art-historical themes , both in comparative surveys and one-person retrospectives , a situation which would call into question the scholarship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Brenson zeroed in on the problem that year as he found fault with the fact that the museum had built its staff around five young curators with little art-historical experience , representing only one generation . Brenson profiled the curators ? the youngest was 33 years old , the oldest was 42 ? and discovered that only one of them held an advanced degree in art history . No wonder then that , as Brenson wrote , " In so many of the Whitney 's catalogs and installations , independent critical and scholarly perspective is absent " ( Brenson , 1989 : 27 ) . Commenting on exhibitions at the Whitney , Brenson continued : The Whitney should present contemporary art in a way that is unmistakably independent of dealer and collector interference . It should present contemporary art in a way that is measured and searching , offering a perspective that galleries , auction houses and corporations can not provide . But how is perspective possible in a museum that is so uneasy with history ? No New York museum seems more trendy and hip , and none is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibition that seemed finished ? in other words , thoroughly conceived , considered and installed ? Who can remember a Whitney exhibition that generated confidence in the museum 's capacity to deal with either the achievements of the old or the challenges of the new ? ( 1989 : 1 ) In reviewing some of the shows under discussion ( 1988 ? 89 season ) , Brenson criticized the Richard Armstrong catalog of the David Park exhibition , for example , as " hurried . " He also called into question the totally American perspective : " This point of view can not do justice to the achievement of an artist for whom European art remained a lantern and European subject matter a guide " ( 1989 : 27 ) . Of the Donald Judd exhibition curated by Barbara Haskell , Brenson wrote : " the catalogue provides little insight into the artist 's formative years , and the show does not include the figurative works from the 1950 's that could have shed light on the absoluteness of Judd 's abstract style . " He noted that the exhibition " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of Mr. Judd 's achievement " and that the design of the show allowed " no sense of chronology and development " ( Brenson , 1988 : 32 ) . Returning to the survey of 30 people who regularly visit museums and galleries , we find that all had been to the Whitney Museum at least once during the 1988 ? 89 season and that 26 of them had seen the " Biennial , " the Whitney 's famous blockbuster exhibition that fills the entire museum with paintings , sculpture , photographs , films , and videotapes produced within the previous two years . Described by Tom Armstrong as " an overview of what we think is interesting at the present moment , what we // think stands out , what makes you think and makes you look , " the " Biennial " was the product of the four Whitney curators and was the museum 's flagship exhibition . Some typical comments coming from the people surveyed included " It 's about who 's cool , who 's in ; " " The prestige of being chosen for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's prices ; " " For the artist it means you 're alive and well . People want to buy your work ; " and " It 's who 's hot and who 's not . " Brenson called the " Biennial " the " foundation " of the museum 's program and noted how , " with relish , " it was allowed to overrun the entire museum . And yet , he wrote , this is where " judgements are ambiguous " and further , " it is unclear from the catalogue essay just what Mr. Armstrong , Mr. Marshall and Ms. Phillips think . There was talk that this Biennial catalogue would include a real essay . But the painting , sculpture and photography text , although graduating from preface ' to introduction ' , is still far short of what is needed . Its style is curt , suggesting the essay was written out of obligation . Key ideas remain unclear " ( Brenson , 1989 : 27 ) . It seems the " Biennial " was more about fashion and money than about a critical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in this , the museum 's single most important exhibition , caused savage criticism by respected art historians in the Times and elsewhere . Is there a corporate connection ? Some think so . Hans Haacke 's perception of the problem alludes to the fact that the museum curators are charged with fundraising , spending time with corporate executives , to insure funding for the museum . They 're told to fund-raise instead of doing their curatorial work . But the curators need to rethink their job , and should be allowed and given time to think . Financial constraints could force museums to rely on their own collections . This would be good because it could lead , if we 're lucky , to genuine scholarship . It could lead curators to learn more about the collections . ( Interview with Nancy Einreinhofer ) Philippe de Montebello sees how the courting of corporate support , specifically for the funding of special exhibits , might undermine scholarship . " Traditional values are upset , " he writes , " Basic museum work ? conservation , research , cataloging , scholarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realizing special events with their quantifiable results . " And these quantifiable results tend to obscure the depth of quality of programs , and quality is soon perceived as a " burden on the bottom line , " rather than a necessity . Are n't museums in danger of creating in this project-oriented world , a whole generation of curators who , because these other duties have denied them sufficient unstructured time for studying and looking , will not have their seniors ' knowledge or experience so they can later perform with intelligence and discrimination in more important positions ? ( de Montebello , 1984 : 48 ) The criticism of the Whitney Museum programs was , in part , what spurred the dismissal of the director . Tom Armstrong was forced out in March , 1990 after several months of art world rumors that the board president , William S. Woodside , had asked for his resignation . " Several trustees have complained privately about the quality of some Whitney shows , " wrote ( : race Glueck in the New York Times , " They attribute that in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curator to run the museum 's collecting and exhibition programs " ( Glueck , 1989b : 21 ) . The museum and the corporation , a relationship developed in earnest by Thomas Hoving , further evolved with Tom Armstrong . While both of these directors departed their posts with mixed reviews , they also broadened the corporate ? museum relationship in irreversible ways . It is what Philippe de Montebello calls the business administration mentality , and he sees this mentality as dominating museums even at the policy-making level . " This means ? I 'm simplifying greatly , drawing a straight line to my point ? that all museum activities , all projects , all work will soon be cost-accounted and that the right questions may no longer be asked " ( de Montebello , 1984 : 48 ) . The " right " questions concern the quality and importance of a project , the " wrong " questions concern the revenues a project might generate . " A museum 's exhibition program now tends to be viewed by the administration as being in the service of the museum 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are exploited by a formidable business machine . .. the whole critical mass of staff and services employed to generate , shape and execute exhibitions " is exploited " to the detriment of the staff 's custodial as well as creative functions " ( de Montebello , 1984 : 47 ) . Warnings from within the profession cite the potential dangers to museums which operate like corporations and to directors who operate like C.E.O.s , but the benefits of the business-administration mentality present a strong draw . Case study II : the Guggenheim Museum The Guggenheim Museum Board of Trustees decided on the corporate approach for its museum when , in 1988 , it hired Thomas Krens as its director . With an undergraduate degree in political economics ( Williams College , 1969 ) and a master 's degree in studio art ( State University of New York at Albany , 1971 ) , Krens returned to Williams College as an assistant professor to teach print-making . In 1980 he became the director of the Williams College Museum of Art and in 1984 received a master 's degree in public and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Krens ' knowledge of art history was largely self-taught . His appointment as director of the Guggenheim was based on his skills in management and development . Those skills would be employed to oversee the somewhat controversial addition to the Frank Lloyd Wright // building in New York as well as the expansion of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice ( Glueck , 1988 : 1 ) . Ile was also at that time managing another major construction project , the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams . A complex of abandoned factories was to be converted into the world 's largest museum of contemporary art and the support facilities it would require , including a hotel , restaurants , shops , and condominiums . The factories , spread over 20 acres , contain 720,000 square feet of space , 500,000 of which would be dedicated to the exhibition of art . The idea for the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art began when Krens was director of the museum at Williams College , basically as an economic redevelopment project . Krens negotiated with the state to set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $35 million bond issue to finance half the project and enable the commission to acquire the mill complex . According to reports in the New York Times , if the museum is not built , the mills would remain empty and the State of Massachusetts would take the loss . Key to the success of the project are the " assets " of the Guggenheim Museum , that is , its collection , which Krens planned to use as a financial base from which to launch the Massachusetts museum . Thomas Krens was viewed by the art and museum communities as a businessman/entrepreneur who talked about art as a commodity and museums as an industry . He proposed to transform the " industry , " to change how museums operate , how they acquire art , how they show it , how they think about it . Museums , he said , are in a crisis , they need to explore " mergers and acquisitions " and understand " asset management . " According to Krens , a museum 's assets are its collections . Its exhibitions and programs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Under the Krens directorship , the Guggenheim sold off some of its " assets " to purchase a huge collection of contemporary art . Art world watchdogs were outraged at the deaccessioning of several major paintings by modern masters including Chagall and Kandinsky . How does the Krens decision to deaccession objects from the Guggenheim collection reflect the influence of the corporation ? A look at museum deaccessioning policy will begin to answer this question . At the height of Hovingism , the Metropolitan Museum secretly sold important paintings from its collection and was subsequently investigated by the New York State attorney general . The Hoving scandal did bring some museums to develop more rigorous deaccession policies , and the American Association of Museums Committee for Professional Practices in Art Museums revised and strengthened its deaccession guidelines , but deaccessions have continued to increase in volume and value . For example , the New York Times reported that the number of museums which put works of art up for sale at Christie 's increased from 28 in 1984 ? 85 to 88 in 1988 ? 89 and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 85 to $29.6 million in 1988 ? 89 ( Kimmelman , 1990a : 1 ) . Christie 's has now established a department to deal specifically with museums . The Metropolitan 's policy since the 1970s has been in keeping with the American Association of Museums and is simply to keep deaccession decisions completely independent of purchasing decisions . This is not to say that the income from the sale of art should not be used for new acquisitions , but rather that the decision to sell a work be based on a policy decision that the museum no longer projects any need for that object . The A.A.M. also recommends that all funds from the sale of art work from the collections be used to replenish the collection . These two policies are generally accepted by American art museums , but , in the case of the Guggenheim , there are some doubts . First is the question of the importance of the paintings to the collection . Several art historians acknowledged the importance of the paintings , especially the Kandinsky , and the magnitude of the loss to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fine Arts at New York University , specializes in the modern period and believes the Kandinsky Fugue to be " one of the most beautiful pictures of his whole expressionist period " ( Glueck , 1990 : 31 ) . " It really was a centerpiece of the collection " ( Weiss , 1990 : 130 ) . Within the museum world there also was criticism . Kirk Varnedoe , director of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art , said : " The general rule is we wo n't sell dead artists to buy living artists " ( Weiss , 1990 : 130 ) . " It is one thing to sell middling Impressionist paintings to buy better Impressionist paintings , " wrote New York Times critic Michael Kimmelman , " It is another thing entirely to sell works by early 20th century masters to buy Minimalist sculpture from the 1960s and ' 70s " ( Kimmelman , 1990a : 1 ) . The modern master 's paintings were sold precisely for that reason . The paintings were sold in order to finance the acquisition of Count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Minimal and Conceptual art . In the process , the Guggenheim set auction records for Chagall ( $14.85 million ) , Modigliani ( $11.55 million ) and Kandinsky ( $20.9 million ) for a total of $47.3 million . So , in disregard of the A.A.M. recommendations , the deaccessioning of these paintings took place not because the museum no longer needed them , but for the purpose of generating money . The revenues from the sale of the paintings would be used to purchase the Panza Collection . Another strategy in which the museum 's collection is used to generate income is that of the franchised Guggenheim . Krens proposed the establishment of Guggenheim museums in Tokyo , Japan ; Salzburg , Austria ; Venice , Italy ; and Bilbao , Spain , in addition to the Soho district of New York City and , as we have seen , the huge complex in North Adams , Massachusetts . The cost of these franchised Guggenheims , according to Krens , would be absorbed by the local governments . They would be staffed by Guggenheim curators , and the art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would he rotated between the franchises . Critics of the plan believe the rotation of holdings will put those objects at risk ( Kimmelman , 1990b : 1 ) . Part of the plan also calls for computer-generated research which would , again according to Krens , enable curators to turn out six or seven major exhibitions and catalogs each year ( Weisgall , 1989 : 60 ) . The deaccession of some of the Guggenheim 's prize paintings equated art with money . In a similar vein , this attitude toward exhibitions and publications equates them with a commercial product to be manufactured , packaged , and marketed , threatening the imposition of cost-effective procedures on curatorial time and scholarship . Effective management of any sort requires an understanding of the nature and purpose of the thing to be managed . Art museum management requires a clear sense of aesthetic standards and sound artistic judgement . As the museum director and art scholar Sherman Lee wrote : An art museum is not the same kind of institution as a corporation . I do n't think many business assumptions are valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of a balance sheet . I think many museums have been put in financial jeopardy and have been mismanaged by the misapplication of business principles . ( Lee , 1983 : 78 ) Thomas Krens expressed his vision for the museum at the occasion of the opening of the renovated Wright building and the Guggenheim Soho . The Guggenheim has aggressively enlarged its permanent collection in scope and depth ; it has increased the number of special exhibits under research and development through the agency of a highly regarded international curatorial staff ; and it has entered into collaborations with foreign government to establish permanent museums abroad that would be operated by , and in conjunction with , the Guggenheim Museum in New York . The complexity of these enterprises notwithstanding , the basic rationale for each of these developments can be found in two fairly simple but complimentary objectives , both essential to the continued vitality of the institution . The lesser objective is the practical need to insure the financial survival and prosperity of the Guggenheim as a cultural institution in an uncertain and rapidly changing world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest possible audience and to secure revenue streams consistently higher than ongoing operating costs . More important , the primary objective goes beyond institutional survival to the museum 's continuing development and even redefinition as a paradigmatic form . The new Guggenheim seeks not only to fulfill its original mission , and contribute to the continuing evolution of the cultural enterprise in its broadest sense , but the mission of the institution must be progressively pursued into the 21st century even if it means that the forms must change . To remain a great institution , the Guggenheim must accommodate the future . That it must honor the conservative tendencies of scholarship and stewardship that have been the traditional hallmarks of the modern // museum goes without saying . But to realize the promise of its original vision and the statement of utopian optimism that is embodied in the very architecture of the building that houses and symbolizes the museum , and to confront the current perception of crisis that pervades the cultural world , the Guggenheim must redefine itself as a new and challenging institution , one with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can aspire to be . ( Krens , 1992 ) The course of the first objective , the financial survival and prosperity of the Guggenheim , is difficult to assess since the museum has not issued an annual report or made public any financial records since 1989 . The attainment of the second objective , " the museum 's continuing development and even redefinition " apparently awaits the twenty-first century . Conclusion Art and the art museum are considered beneficial to the society . A visit to an art museum may provide an aesthetic experience or an educational opportunity . It may be spiritually , intellectually , or morally uplifting . Art and the art museum are considered to exist outside the realm of commerce yet have the potential for high popular appeal . All of these elements and conditions make the sponsorship of the art museum very appealing to American corporations . A corporation can improve its public image by association with the art museum . Through sponsorship of special exhibitions , a corporation may gain wide public awareness of its product or service and better customer relations . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the corporation . The benefits to the museum in this relationship are obviously monetary , but what are the dangers ? This study indicates , through the analysis of the corporate presence at the Metropolitan Museum , the Guggenheim Museum , and the Whitney Museum , that the museum and its staff may be compromised . The corporation , when underwriting an exhibition , will apply its usual cost-accounting procedures and will expect some predetermined return for each dollar expended . This raises questions about how curatorial decisions might be influenced and how administrative policy might be determined . What may be at risk is nothing less than the very heart of museum scholarship . 8 The scholar and the capitalist : the common goals of Alfred H. Barr and Nelson Rockefeller in building the Museum of Modern Art Introduction The Museum of Modern Art in New York began as " an experiment to determine whether sufficient public interest exists to justify the establishment of a permanent institution devoted to collecting , exhibiting , and studying modern art . " It was the first American museum devoted to modern art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , modern architecture , design , film , and photography . It was , from its beginnings , the premier American authority of things modern , including the concept of the modern museum . The Museum of Modern Art instituted museum practices previously unheard of , adopting marketing methods , for example , from the American corporation . The fact that it was new , was modern , was considered experimental , allowed the Museum of Modern Art great latitude in developing policies and programs . It was modern , established by capitalists , for the purpose of educating the populace . Thus the three influences on the American art museum being examined here ( modernism , capitalism , democracy ) are present in full force in the Museum of Modern Art , and their implications may be clarified through a closer look at this one museum . The Museum of Modern Art has , as an advocate of modernism , influenced museum architecture , supplanting the palace in the park with a modern , climate-controlled structure designed to move large crowds through exhibitions and into a restaurant or retail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual works of art have been altered as a result of the practices of the Museum of Modern Art . In its mission to collect , exhibit , and study modern art , the Museum has shown a strong democratic tendency . The collection includes not only the rather difficult paintings of the high modernists but also the welldesigned yet mundane objects of everyday life . Exhibits at the Museum of The scholar and the capitalist 1 S1 Modern Art have , of course , come from every department and have ranged from , for example , the scholarly exhibitions of Cubist painting to the exhibition of " Useful Objects of American Design tinder $10 " ( 1940 ) . In its mission to provide for the study of modern art , this museum has shed light on alternative educational methods which , while distinctly connected to the Museum of Modern Art , have nonetheless provided insights for other museums . Even the refinement of wall labels for the purpose of instruction for all is considered by many to be part of the legacy of Alfred Barr . The Museum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout its history , close ties to capitalism . A member of the Rockefeller family , America 's foremost capitalists , was present at the birth of the Museum , and the family has continuously been represented on the Museum 's Board of Trustees and has instituted , as we shall see , corporate tactics into the Museum 's operations . The three influences of modernism , democracy , and capitalism were intertwined from the beginning and have grown together through the years . The protagonists in this development were the founding director , Alfred Barr , and the founding family , the Rockefellers , in particular , Nelson Rockefeller . Alfred Barr , in his position of founding director , proved to be not only a modernist , but a populist , and in time , a capitalist . The Rockefeller legacy brought forth the Museum and set it on a selfsupporting course with the help of what Nelson Rockefeller called " enlightened capitalism . " The roles of these key people were critical in the development of the Museum , and the results have influenced the museum world up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholar and the capitalist came together to build a democratic , consumer-oriented museum without sacrificing excellence . The beginnings of that collaboration will be examined in this chapter . Alfred H. Barr , founding director Alfred H. Barr , Jr . was born in Detroit in 1902 , son of a Presbyterian minister , and raised in Baltimore from the age of nine ( Marquis , 1989 : 3-6 ) . In 1918 , he entered Princeton University and soon after enrolled in Charles Rufus Morey 's course in medieval art , a course which would forever influence Barr 's thinking . Taught as a record of that civilization , combining painting and sculpture with architecture , murals , illuminated manuscripts , and crafts , the medieval art course became Alfred Barr 's education model . Following graduation from Princeton in 1922 , Barr was awarded a Master of Arts degree ( 1923 ) in art and archaeology and assumed a teaching assistantship at Harvard University 's department of fine arts . Barr completed his course work toward the Ph.D . and in the Fall of 1926 was appointed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At this time he also enrolled in Paul Sachs ' museum // course at the Fogg Museum , Harvard Univcrsity . Sachs arranged for a twelve-month traveling scholarship for Barr , which enabled the young scholar extended time in England , I Tolland , Germany , Russia , and France . Most significant among these travels was a visit to the Bauhaus at Dessau , where he met the architect Walter Gropius , and artists Paul Klee , Herbert Bayer , Oscar Schlemmer , Josef Albers , Lyonel Feininger , and Lazslo Maholy-Nagy ( Lynes , 1973 : 28 ; Marquis , 1989 : 48-9 ) . The influence of this school , where all the arts ( painting , sculpture , textile design , graphic design , photography , industrial design ) were taught under the umbrella of architecture , reinforced and expanded on Morey 's educational methods . Barr called the Bauhaus building designed by Gropius " the most important structure of its decade . " He wrote that the Bauhaus was " the one school in the world where modern problems of design were approached realistically in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 7 ) . This firsthand exposure to a modern art school where all the modern arts , crafts , materials , techniques , and ideas were taught in concert seemed a variation of Morey 's medieval art course at Princeton . Barr developed a course at Wellesley , the first of its scope at any college in America , which covered modern painting , sculpture , architecture , music , film , photography , and design . He also developed a course of lectures on modern art which included " The Bauhaus at Dessau ... Walter Gropius the visionary ; the executive ; the architect . .. The painters Kandinsky , Feininger and Klee ... The curriculum : Material , Technique and Form , ( Albers ) ; architecture , ( Gropius , Hannes Meyer ) ; furniture and decorative arts ; photography , ( Moholy-Nagy ) ; theater and ballet , ( Schlemmer ) ; typography and posters , ( Bayer ) . The Bauhaus as a national and international influence " ( Barr , 1929a ) . When the founders of the Museum of Modern Art , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director to the then 26-year-old Alfred Barr , the young scholar proposed the organization of the new museum be based on his course at Wellesley . The Museum , he proposed , could begin with exhibitions of painting and sculpture and then expand to the other areas of modern art , including drawing , prints , photography , and design . Barr succeeded , in time , in introducing photography , film , design and decorative arts , and architecture . The practical , commercial , and popular arts would be exhibited along with the traditional fine art media . In 1932 , he established a Department of Architecture and a Department of Circulating Exhibitions and a reference library of 2,000 volumes . In 1934 , he initiated the Design Collection , and in 1935 , the Museum of Modern Art Film Library ( now called the Department of Film ) was established , the first department in any museum in the world devoted to this twentiethcentury art form . The Department of Photography was founded in 1940 , the first curatorial department dedicated to photography . In retrospect , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time // when few Americans knew anything of modern art , was able to thoroughly grasp the concept of modernism in its variety of forms and idiosyncratic manifestations . Ile viewed them in the context of the whole of art history , amassed this storehouse of ideas and images , organized them in some thematic way , and made them available to the general populace . Barr as populist When he issued essays regarding the opening of the Museum , Alfred Barr referred to the history of the public 's relationship to advanced art and the cultural necessity of the Museum of Modern Art . New York has been extraordinarily negligent in providing a public institution where such loan exhibitions might be seen with some consistent regularity . More serious still is the absence of any permanent public collection of modern art in New York . ( Barr , 1930a : 13 ) Barr recognized from the beginning the importance of educational efforts in order to reach the uninitiated public and went on to say : Although the Museum has no definite educational program in addition to its exhibitions it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first exhibition the galleries were specially opened to classes from Barnard , Colombia and New York University , as well as to various private lecturers and groups of artists . Barr did view the exhibition itself as the primary educational tool . The first exhibition opened November 7 on the twelfth floor of the Heckscher Building at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street and included paintings and drawings by the European masters of modern art ? Cezanne , Gauguin , Seurat , and Van Gogh . The catalog , with an essay by Barr , marks the beginning of the Museum 's publication program and lists 35 paintings by Cezanne , seven of which were watercolor ; 25 paintings by Gauguin and one drawing ; seventeen works by Seurat including four oil studies and six pencil drawings ; and 25 oil paintings by Van Gogh plus three works on paper ( Barr , 1929b ) . This bringing-together of more than one hundred works by these modern masters lent credibility to the museum and excited the public . According to the Herald Tribune , November 10 , 1929 , " several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was open to the public . An article in the New York Times two weeks after the opening noted that " attendance at the museum has increased steadily " and reported almost 3,000 people in attendance on a Saturday afternoon . Final tallies show a total attendance of 47,000 people , indicating a clear interest in modern art ( Barr , 1930a : 13 ) . The choice of Cezanne , Gauguin , Seurat and Van Gogh to introduce modernist ideas to New York was a success as indicated by attendance but The scholar and the capltalbt 1SS also because it constituted an intelligent art historical lesson . Barr described the artists as " especially honored pioneers who founded new t raditions and . . . rediscovered old ones . " " Gauguin whose burning color and exotic sentiment conceal somber power ; Van Gogh the master ? and the victim  --  of spontaneous artistic combustion ; Cezanne arriving by infinitely patient trial and error at conclusions which have changed the direction of the history of art ; Seurat who proved that great art can proceed from cool exquisite calculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionary are certain aspects of their work that it is still subject to misunderstanding and , for a recalcitrant few , a battle ground of controversy " ( Barr , 1929b : 11 , 27 ) . The second exhibition of " Nineteen Living Americans " ( 1929 ? 30 ) , was organized at the insistence of the Board in an effort to demonstrate that the Museum would champion American artists as well as Europeans . " Ballots containing over a hundred names were distributed among the trustees who were asked to check the fifteen painters who each thought should be shown in the Museum 's first exhibition of American painting . The results were tabulated and carefully studied by a committee who drew up the list of nineteen . " Unfortunately , it lacked real focus , so diverse were the artists . Burchfield , Demuth , Hopper , Marin , O'Keeffe , and Sloan were represented ( Barr , 1929 ? 30 : 9 ) . The third exhibition , called " Painting in Paris , " contained works by Braque , Chagall , de Chirico , Matisse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crafted by Barr to enlighten visitors regarding modern painting seems to have been well received , since attendance was recorded at 58,575 . Clearly , there was an enthusiastic audience for European modern art , the art Alfred Barr believed to be central to Modernism . " Surely Paris in the early twentieth century need bow to no other period of painting " Barr proclaimed in the catalog as he placed these European modernists amidst the whole history of art ( Barr , 1930b : 16 ) . Always the educator , Barr produced a catalog essay describing the modernist movements in simple and direct terms . " The fauves ' painted pictures using crude distorted heavy outlines and harsh unnatural ' colors which were as much a proclamation of emancipation as the result of aesthetic exigency . ' They were possessed by two passions ? the problem of design and the expression of emotion . To these two ends they sacrificed the contemporary conception of natural appearances " ( p. 12 ) . Barr offered a definition of cubism as " a simplification of landscape , figures and other objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed through several phases and , by 1917 , had evolved from the imitation of nature to the creation of an abstract design " ( p. 13 ) . He went on to describe the Surrealists as originating from " a group of literary advance-guardists with political opinions ... For them the dream is the supreme experience ; the sub-conscious the exclusive source of artistic values " ( p. 15 ) . While Barr held a vision of a Museum of Modern Art that would be // triumphant , he put the challenge of supporting such an institution to the public . " The present galleries are as yet only a challenging experiment . At the end of two years it should he possible to determine whether New York really wants a permanent Museum of Modern Art " ( 1930a : 13 ) . The success of these first exhibitions and catalogs insured the continued support of the Board for Barr 's vision of the Museum . Exactly ten years later , on May 10 , 1939 , the Museum of Modern Art 's new modern museum building at 11 West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , Franklin D. Roosevelt . The events leading to the construction of the first modern museum building and to the development of the collection it housed , already the most distinguished of its kind in the world , are inextricably tied to the exacting intellectual tenacity of Alfred Barr and to his comprehension of how populist support could produce capital . Barr as capitalist The scholarly exhibitions he organized and the informative catalogs he authored combined with lively social events to keep the press reporting and the public coming . Barr aided the public relations endeavor by hiring , in 1930 , an expert in the field to develop a strategy for a membership drive and a fundraising drive . ( See also " Thomas Hoving and the corporate museum partnership " in Chapter 7 . ) The Museum of Modern Art was also the first museum to organize , in August of 1933 , an in-house Publicity Department . In the course of the next ten years 1.6 million people would view 125 special exhibitions and the Museum 's Bulletin would report more than 4,000 members . Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern art would be built consisting of 271 paintings , 97 sculptures , 308 watercolors , six pastels , 149 prints , and an unrecorded number of drawings ( compiled from records in the MOMA Bulletin ) . The heart of the Museum 's collection was the gift of one of the founders , Miss Lillie Bliss . Bequeathed at her death in 1931 , the collection was transferred to the Museum in 1934 when the condition of a sufficient endowment had been met . It was recorded in the Bulletin that , to fulfill the terms of the Bliss bequest , " the Museum , by a quiet six weeks ' campaign among its friends , raised a $600,000 Endowment Fund " ( Bulletin , April , 1934 : 1 ) . The collection contained paintings by Renoir , Degas , Pissarro , Gauguin , Seurat , Toulouse-Lautrec , Matisse , Modigliani , and Picasso and scores of drawings and prints . Perhaps most important of all was the collection of 21 paintings by Cezanne ( 10 watercolors and 11 oils ) . " With the Bliss collection , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can look London , Paris , Berlin , Amsterdam , Chicago in the face so far as public collections of modern art are concerned " ( Bulletin , April , 1934 : 4 ) . Although Barr was reserved and scholarly , he clearly was not above appealing to potential donors on the basis of financial gain through // investment in modern paintings , Ile acknowledged that private patronage was necessary for the health of the arts and the success of his museum . Barr could describe the difficulty , even hostility , with which modern paintings might be met and then go on to cite the increase in monetary value for the same works of art . International exhibitions in Paris ( 1906 ? 12 ) , Cologne ( 1912 ) , London ( 1911 ) , and in New York , the famous Armory exhibition of 1913 , precipitated general excitement flavored with rage and laughter . But the paintings by Cezanne , Seurat , Van Gogh and Gauguin , which hung in these exhibitions and seemed then unintelligible and ridiculous , are bought by collectors now for sums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is provided by Seurat 's La Grande Jatte which was sold at the death of the painter in 1891 for $200 , sold again somewhat later for $390 and was purchased for the Birch ? Bartlett Memorial Collection of the Chicago Art Institute about 1925 for approximately $25,000 . In 1930 , an offer of over $400,000 was refused . This represents an increase in bid ' value of about 200,000 percent in forty years . ( Barr , 1936a : 2 ) Barr 's ability in this regard was , in part , the legacy of his teacher Paul J. Sachs , who trained his student-curators to court collectors and present solid arguments for investments and donations . Sachs was responsible , through his museum course at Harvard University , for training the administrators of many of America 's largest and most important museums at the time , including the Metropolitan Museum of Art , the National Gallery in Washington , and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts . His influence is worth noting because of its breadth and because it helped shape the Museum of Modern Art . Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly from a family-owned Wall Street brokerage house in 1914 at the age of 36 . His background in finance played a critical part in his expansion of the Fogg and influenced the content of his course instruction . Sachs developed a year-long graduate museum course in which he taught his students not only the appreciation of art , but the administrative skills he believed America 's curators should have . Sachs provided guest lecturers , some of whom would be the future employers of his students . He also took his students on tours of private collections , collections of potential donors to America 's museums . These connections served to lend prestige to the course and success to the students , many of whom went on to responsible positions in American museums ( Lynes , 1973 : 12 ; Marquis , 1989 : 36 ) . Some of Sachs ' central tenets were : the acknowledgement of European influence on American culture , the role of education in appreciating artistic efforts , and the need for an elite to guide the populace ( Sachs , 1939 : 6 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were expected to return to the populace and instruct it . " It has been well said that All government calls for an elite ; business calls for an elite ; ' and I might add that sound museum administration and scholarship must rest upon an I sK The American Art Museum elite " ( p. 7 ) . Sachs thought of the curator as artistic interpreter . I le trained his elite core to determine both the cultural and monetary value of a work of art and to covey the cultural value to the museum visitor while figuring out how to raise the money to acquire the object for the museum 's collection . His students were first of all administrators trained in a market economy that favored a distinctly American consumption of art ( see Chapter 7 ) . The Museum of Modern Art under the direction of Sachs ' most famous student , Alfred Barr , would be the first testing ground for Sachs ' ideas about the museum profession . The Museum of Modern Art , at its inception , operated like no other museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as director , but also curated all the exhibits , wrote the catalogs , and determined what the museum should purchase . As the museum grew and these functions became more complex , the museum operated more and more along the lines of a private American corporation , and Alfred Barr 's role changed . But initially , his position was what Sachs prescribed to create a museum operating on the highest level of scholarship and reaching the populace as well . The structure of the museum , educational by its nature , was in place . This structure , combined with catalogs , wall labels and lectures , provided the means of instructing the masses brought into the museum through the prodding of the popular press . The pragmatic stance of viewing art as investment was also taken and , although Alfred Barr may not have realized it at the time , his constantly changing exhibitions created for the museum a consumer constituency . Barr as modernist It seems a most appropriate notion that a modern museum would be in constant flux , reflecting , in its tempo , modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the economy on which it is based , annihilates everything that it creates ? physical environments , social institutions , metaphysical ideas , artistic visions , moral values ? in order to create more , to endlessly create the world anew . This disposable , consumer culture forces us to grapple with the question of what is essential , what is important , what is meaningful . That is the question most often addressed by modern artists ( see Chapter 5 ) . Historians trace the beginnings of modernism to discoveries in the physical sciences which changed our ideas about the universe and caused a reinterpretation of religious doctrine . Scientific discoveries also transformed production , and industrialization was born . Modernization created new human environments and destroyed old ones , the tempo of life speeded up , and immense demographic upheavals resulted in rapid urban growth . Mass communication and new forms of corporate power created an ever-expanding capitalist world market . Modernism nourished an amazing variety of visions and ideas which found form in the art and architecture of the twentieth century . ' I he Museum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forms of modern culture and would do so , in large part , through its architecture . The sleek new building that opened in 1939 to house the world 's greatest collection of modern art in all its manifestations was the result of architectural ideas discovered and promoted by Alfred Barr years earlier . Barr visited the Bauhaus in Dessau , Germany in 1927 and was inspired by its comprehensive approach to the visual arts . Just as the Bauhaus mix of fine arts , commercial arts , and industrial arts constituted the basis of Barr 's departmental structure of the Museum of Modern Art , so would its architecture influence the design of the Museum 's building . Shortly after the Museum of Modern Art was founded , Barr invited two like-minded scholars to organize an exhibition of Bauhaus-style architecture . Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson curated " Modern Architecture : International Exhibition , " which was accompanied by a catalog detailing the new architecture Barr himself labeled the " International Style " ( Hitchcock et al . 1932 ) . A number of progressive architects have converged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world Barr wrote in the catalog essay . Both in appearance and structure this style is peculiar to the twentieth century and is as fundamentally original as the Greek or Byzantine or Gothic ... The aesthetic principles of the International Style are based primarily upon the nature of modern materials and structure and upon modern requirements in planning . Slender steel posts and beams , and concrete reinforced by steel have made possible structures of skeleton-like strength and lightness . The external surfacing materials are of painted stucco or tile , or , in more expensive buildings , of aluminum or thin slabs of marble or granite and of glass both opaque and transparent . Planning , liberated from the necessity for symmetry so frequently required by tradition is , in the new style , flexibly dependent upon convenience . These technical and utilitarian factors in the hands of designers who understand inherent aesthetic possibilities have resulted in an architecture comparable in integrity and even in beauty to the styles of the past . ( Hitchcock et al . 1932 : 12 ) Barr , always the educator , edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : just as the modern architect has had to adjust himself to modern problems of design and structure so the modern public , in order to appreciate his achievements , must make parallel adjustments to what seems new and strange . ( Hitchcock et al . 1932 : 12 ) He then goes on to instruct the reader/museum visitor in a definition of International Style architecture , a definition that holds true to this day . Barr sets down four principles of architectural design he calls the principles ( 1 ) of volume ; ( 2 ) of regularity ; ( 3 ) of flexibility ; and ( 4 ) the " comprehensive principle of positive and negative . " l ou I AO AnanaN API MNUNNI The principle of volume is clear : The modern architect ... conceives of his building not as a structure of brick or masonry with thick columns and supporting walls resting heavily upon the earth but rather as a skeleton enclosed by a thin light shell . He thinks in terms of volume of space enclosed by planes or surfaces ? as opposed to mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularity and flexibility are related in Barr 's definition . He refers to the historic use of bilateral symmetry , that is , balanced masses on either side of a central axis , and to the horizontal division of the facade . This is compared to the modern building which reveals its structure through both horizontal and verticle division which may very well be asymmetrical , depending on the function of the building , ergo : flexibility . Barr also makes reference to the lack of decoration when he writes : " He the architect permits the horizontal floors of his skyscraper and the rows of windows in his school to repeat themselves boldly without artificial accents or terminations " ( p. 1S ) . The structure revealing itself and its function constitutes the aesthetics of the building . The fourth " comprehensive principle of positive and negative " refers to the positive use of materials , technically appropriate , applied in delicate proportions , and the elimination ( therefore negative ) of any kind of ornament or artificial pattern . In his essay , Barr acknowledges that the " lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the style for the layman to accept " and goes on to explain that " Intrinsically there is no reason why ornament should not be used , but modern ornament , usually crass in design and machine-manufactured , would seem to mar rather than adorn the clean perfection of surface and proportion " ( p. 15 ) . The exhibition accompanied by its 200-page catalog toured the United States , in different versions , for over seven years spreading the new architectural message . By praising the architecture 's modernity , originality , and , most important , its aesthetic qualities , Barr focused on architecture as art . By using the Bauhaus building at Dessau , designed by Walter Gropius , as the best illustration of the principles of modern design , Barr demonstrated how a modern institution might propagate the faith . And when , in 1936 , the Museum of Modern Art initiated plans to build a new building , it would , of course , be in what had come to be known as the International Style . Alfred Barr had great hopes that the new museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been associated with the Bauhaus , perhaps Walter Gropius or Mies von der Rohe . But alas , this was not to be ( Lynes , 1973 : 190 ; Marquis , 1989 : 168 , 169 ) . Philip Goodwin was an architect and a trustee of the Museum and was selected by his fellow trustees to be architect for the new Museum of Modern Art . He appointed a young American , Edward Durell Stone , as his associate for the project . Edward Durrell Stone had been the codesigner of the Rockefeller 's Radio City Music Hall and had the backing of Nelson Rockefeller . Barr was terribly disappointed , and resigned from the Building Committee in defeat , an act which might be viewed as the symbolic end of one period and beginning of another . Alfred Barr no longer held the directorship prescribed by Paul Sachs . Alfred Barr 's scholarship and expertise , as evidenced in exhibitions and catalogs , had established the Museum 's credibility , and his efforts in spreading the modernist message had taken the form of modern marketing techniques . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a truly capitalistic structure , one that would be initiated by Nelson Rockefeller . The new Museum of Modern Art building designed by trustee Philip Goodwin and associate Edward Durrell Stone received a warm welcome when it opened just three years later in 1939 . It was in fact the first International Style building in America and was praised in Architectural Forum for its " efficient and flexible plan , superlative use of materials , color , furnishings ... a thoroughly distinguished addition to the best modern architecture has produced " ( August , 1939 : 116 ) . Nelson Rockefeller presided at the opening of the new building , presiding in his new post of President of the Board of Trustees . Alfred Barr , while respected as a scholar , was no longer idealized as the allknowing cultural administrator . The power had begun to shift , and the future and the character of the Museum of Modern Art would now begin to be defined to a large extent by the Board . The Rockefeller charitable legacy Nelson Rockefeller , son of John D. Rockefeller , Jr . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board in 1932 . The importance of Nelson Rockefeller 's role in the development of the Museum of Modern Art is the result , in part , of his presence during the Museum 's formative years . ( In contrast , by the time his younger brother David came of age , the character of the Museum and the direction in which it would move were well established . ) Nelson played an important part in establishing the physical plant , the collections , and the financial operation of the Museum . He had a sincere interest in modern art , an interest stimulated no doubt by his mother . This combined with his unfaltering faith in capitalism , inherited perhaps from his father and grandfather . The Rockefeller legacy began with Nelson 's grandfather , John D. , a Cleveland , Ohio bookkeeper who at the age of 23 went into business with Samuel Andrews , the inventor of an inexpensive process for the refinement of crude petroleum . At the age of 30 , John D. formed the Standard Oil Company and within six years had gained control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a virtual monopoly on their marketing facilities as well . Rockefeller 's business dealings were questioned by individual Americans , newspapers and popular journals , and the United States Supreme Court which , by an antitrust decision in 191I , broke Standard Oil into smaller companies . Although his philanthropic tendencies were present even prior to his financial success and grew as his earnings grew , Rockefeller 's generosity was regarded with suspicion ( Collier , 1976 : 3 ? 4 ) . Not until John D. Rockefeller had earned almost $1 billion and given away $500 million ( the largest sum ever donated by an individual ) did the public become satisfied that the scale of his good works matched that of his wealth . John D. Rockefeller established large philanthropic institutions with the guidance of Frederick T. Gates , a Baptist minister and fundraiser . Gates established guidelines for various Rockefeller philanthropies . In 1913 , the Rockefeller Foundation was chartered , and $100 million was set aside " to promote the well-being of mankind throughout the world " ( Collier , 1976 : 65 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promote higher education in the United States ; medical research throughout the world ; scientific agriculture ; the fine arts and the refinement of taste ; and Christian ethics and Christian civic virtue . These funds would be administered by the Rockefeller Foundation , the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research , the General Education Board , and the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Fund ( Collier , 1976 : 100 ) . By the time John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , came of age , presiding over the family 's philanthropic institutions was a full-time job . Junior , as he was called , was president of the Foundation and on the board of the Institute for Medical Research while Gates held the chairmanships of both foundations . In 1917 , Gates stepped down and Junior assumed full control of both chairs . With his wife , Abby Aldrich , Junior extended the family 's interests beyond the initial activities of the Rockefeller ? Gates philanthropic institution . Rockefeller Junior contributed to the establishment and maintenance of National Parks from Maine to California . In 1925 , he supplied the Metropolitan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and later constructed the Cloisters Museum as a branch of the Metropolitan Museum to house the collection . In 1927 , he began the restoration of Colonial Williamsburg , one of several restorations he financed in the United States and Europe . In 1928 , he began construction of his most ambitious project , Rockefeller Center . Abby Aldrich Rockefeller , like her husband , was interested in art . She had been educated in the prominent European art movements as was the custom of her class in that time , and upon her marriage to John D. , Jr. , she began to collect the art a wealthy family was expected to own : Old Masters . Abby Aldrich Rockefeller was also a woman with an adventurous spirit . She maintained a gallery of modern art housed on the top floor of the family 's New York City mansion . Much to the chagrin of her rather conservative husband , Abby studied the new art , invited the art intellectuals of the day to her gallery ( including Allred Barr ) , and instilled in her children an appreciation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modern art was so strong that in 1929 Abby Rockefeller , along with two other wealthy socialites , Mrs. Cornelius Sullivan and Miss Lillie P. Bliss , founded the Museum of Modern Art . These women , and a handful of recruited founding fathers , had access to the intellectual and material wealth necessary to successfully launch the new endeavor during a period of national catastrophe , the stockmarket crash of 1929 and the Great Depression . In retrospect , it seems an unlikely time to begin such a daring adventure , but , as Mrs. Rockefeller wrote to her sister the same year the museum idea was formed : To me art is one of the great resources of my life . I believe that it not only enriches the spiritual life , but that it makes one more sane and sympathetic , more observant and understanding , regardless of whatever age it springs from , whatever subjects it represents . ( Rockefeller , 1929 ) Surely this period in American history had need of an enriched spirituality . The Rockefeller influence on the Museum of Modern Art not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched across the years directing its growth and defining its mission . A Rockefeller , as we have seen , participated in the conception of the idea of the museum ; a Rockefeller gave the land for the museum ; the building resulted from Rockefeller donations , and the collection was built in large part with Rockefeller support . There has always been a Rockefeller on the Museum of Modern Art board , and the Rockefeller philosophy of expansionism has prevailed . At the time of her death in 1948 , the Museum of Modern Art Bulletin stated Abby Rockefeller 's enthusiasm for the Museum . " She served as a Trustee continuously since November 1929 , was its first Treasurer , has held the offices of 1st Vice-President and 1st Vice-Chairman , and has worked unfailingly on countless committees " ( Bulletin 1948 : 23 ) . " It was to modern art that she gave her heart , " wrote the New York HeraldTribune , " and the city should long be grateful to her for her discerning eye and her generous , modest leadership . To say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum of Modern Art is to understate the case " ( Bulletin , 1948 : 23 ) . Her love of modern art and dedication to the Museum would have a profound influence on the lives of two of her sons , Nelson and David , and on her daughter-in-law , Mrs. John D. Rockefeller III ( Blanchette ) . All three would serve Abby Rockefeller 's Museum of Modern Art in many capacities , giving generously of their time and money . Nelson Rockefeller would be the first . During his Freshman year at Dartmouth College , Abby took Nelson on a Christmas vacation excursion to the studios of some modern artists , including Arthur B. Davies , one of the initiators of the Armory Show of 1913 . When Nelson wrote to his Nelson Rockefeller , enlightened capitalist Nelson Rockefeller edited a journal called Fine Arts while a student at Dartmouth and practiced on his own the art of photography . Upon graduation from college his mother arranged for him to serve with her on the Museum 's Board of Trustees . Nelson was 23 years old . Within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and five years later he was elected President of the Museum ( information compiled from records in the Museum of Modern Art Bulletin ) . In a 1941 CBS radio interview , Nelson , then President of the Museum , spoke . How did my interest in art begin ? Well , my family has always been interested in art , and I more or less grew up with it . We have always had discussions and plans about art at home . I am interested in art that relates to the life of our own day , expresses the spirit of our time ; that is n't cloistered and set apart ; that includes the house and the motor car and the rest of the things we live with , as well as painting and sculpture . To my mind , that is the way art can be made to mean something to the individual : to be part of the materials of living . The true enjoyment of art is more than a vague and dutiful respect paid to the traditions of the past . At home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not so much interested in its historical value , as in the pleasure it gives ; the contribution it makes to the room and to the house . But what attracts me most to the art of our time is its vitality  --  the way it explores new possibilities and makes use of new materials . That is what I like best about the Museum . It is trying to make the art of today useful and enjoyable to the public of today . Our contemporary arts need not wait fifty or a hundred years before they are widely appreciated . ( Rockefeller , 1941 ) Mrs. John D. Jr . certainly was interested in having her son assume a position of influence in the Museum , but she was not only ambitious for Nelson , she was ambitious for her museum and recognized that he would serve it well . When Nelson assumed the presidency of the Museum in 1939 he was 30 years old and the Museum of Modern Art was just ten . It was the beginning of a new era , because the Museum was moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a modern museum . It was an era of new ideas in museum administration , including the application of the methods of what Nelson referred to as " enlightened capitalism . " Nelson Rockefeller knew the Museum well , for he had served as its Treasurer , Chairman of the Advisory Committee , and as a member of the Executive Committee and of the Building Committee . ( Unless otherwise noted , all information was gleaned from the Bulletin , and the MOMA Financial Reports . ) Although he was only 30 years old , he was already the President of Rockefeller Center and a director of Creole Petroleum Corporation , a subsidiary of Standard Oil . Nelson Rockefeller understood corporate management and was quick to apply capitalist principles to the
