WHEN YOU MISS A SHOT , what do you blame ? A mechanical flaw ? Wrong club ? Bad yardage ? A sudden gust of wind ? These are certainly easy targets and many times the right ones . But if you want a solution you can fix , look elsewhere . It 's likely you 're guilty of one of golf 's Seven Deadly Sins-Sloth , Fear , Self-Loathing , Perfectionism , Haste , Indecision , and Stubbornness . They are the great shotwreckers , capable of destroying entire rounds . And golfers invest a lot of time in their practice . Thinking negatively comes to us a lot easier than the ability to channel thoughts to a positive outcome . But thinking mistakes are easier to correct than swing mistakes . It takes rare talent to swing a club like Fred Couples or Greg Norman . But if you have reasonable intelligence , you have the capability to learn self-discipline . Performance is potential minus interference . John Daly has a wealth of potential , yet there are still mental roadblocks to his game reaching full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminated the negatives from his game so he could fulfill his potential . The Seven Deadly Sins are some of the greatest distractions to your game . Remove their power by practicing their opposites . But first you must identify them . See if you have committed any or all of the Deadly Seven . You 're not required to do penance-bad shots are penalty enough . But we can lead you out of the wilderness . Sloth LET S FACE IT ; most golfers are too lazy to improve their games . Hitting balls is time-consuming . The short game is a chore . And , for most golfers , the mental game does n't exist . Even when they do spend time on their games , golfers are the worst practicers in all of sport , including the Tour pros . They practice by the hour , rather than the objective . Golfers never seem to have a plan . Part of it is lack of self-discipline . Golf is supposed to teach us self-discipline and few of us have it . Sloth takes two forms in golf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to practice the right things . Most players hit buckets of balls with no idea of what they want to accomplish . Often they wind up with worse mechanics when the practice session is over than when they started . The other type of sloth is the unconcerned attitude toward any type of method . The preshot routine ( GOLF MAGAZINE , December 1995 ) is the cornerstone of successful golf , yet most golfers approach each shot blindly . SOLUTION DEVELOP A PRESHOT ROUTINE and stick with it , no matter what . You do n't have to be at the course to work on visualization and routine . You can get some help by having a friend videotape your swing when your tempo and rhythm are at their best . Edit it down to a fiveminute tape and watch it before you go to sleep . Do n't look for mechanical things . Look at the time when your tempo and rhythm were best . Try to retrigger what that feels like . HAVE A PLAN and practice it . The old salesman 's motto is , " Plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the players I work with to write down what they want to accomplish during practice . They are not to stay on the tee a minute longer than it takes to accomplish the goal . Neither should you . Fear I 'VE WORKED WITH a few NASCAR drivers and I ask each one , " When are you going to talk about fear ? " They do n't . They tell me they would have washed out of the sport at the dirt-track level if they had fear . They talk about respect for the track , the car , and other drivers , but never about fear . In contrast , golfers talk constantly about fear , despite their realization there are no dangerous consequences . But there is a lot of ego . You 're out there on your own . The outcome , so obvious and basic , is apparent to everyone . If you make a mistake , no hiding , no teammate can erase it . One of our greatest fears is looking foolish . Not surprisingly , fear of success is a close kin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , they will be expected to do it again . Those people tend to set low goals so that they wo n't be held accountable . In both instances , self-awareness becomes self-consciousness . Selfawareness is how you want to move your body and how you want to shape your shots . When you are self-conscious , you lose concentration , and the outcome is usually bad . The stronger your self-concept , the more secure you are in yourself Saying , " I do n't care where this shot goes , and I do n't care what these people think " takes mental toughness . SOLUTION PUT THE GAME IN PERSPECTIVE . Everybody misses shots . The greatest players in the world can hit some ugly shots on Thursdays and Fridays . If you hit a bad shot , what 's the worst thing that can happen ? You shank it out of bounds ? You lose the hole ? So what ? Unless you play the game for a living , it really does n't matter . And even to those who do , it does n't matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIMITATIONS and trust what you have . Manuel de la Torre , one of the game 's great teachers , said to find your swing and spend the rest of your life perfecting it . Do n't bounce around from swing to swing . Find the one that works and trust it . GET INTO THE PROCESS and let the outcome happen . We are not in control of the outcome . You must accept that golf is not fair . Fear usually involves anticipation of negative outcome . The two worst fears in golf are the yips and shanks . Both originate in the mind . You 've missed the shot before you 've moved the club . If you 've done everything you can to put yourself in a position to hit a good shot , you should have no worries . Self-Loathing GOLFERS SAY WORSE THINGS to themselves than they would ever dream of saying to anyone else . Next time you are with your regular group , listen to the way your playing companions berate themselves . We 've all done it-beating ourselves unmercifully over the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid . " Or , some players pout and withdraw into a sullen silence . That 's called " nonverbal whining . " Give yourself a break . Golf is a hard enough game without depending on it for self-esteem . Yet , for some golfers , if you play well , everything 's right with the world , but if you play badly , suddenly you 've transformed into a bad person . Think of the mind and body as a battery . Drain that battery with negative self-talk and you lose energy . How many times have you been more tired doing mental work than physical work ? Words have the power to evoke strong negative images . As a result , more tension is created , and tension is the great destroyer of the golf swing . You can either talk yourself into a good shot or talk yourself out of one . SOLUTION TRY TO BE YOUR OWN CADDIE . Talk to yourself the same way a good caddie would talk to you . Be on your side . Act your way into good thinking . ACCEPT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say in golf are , " Thank you . " If someone compliments you , let him . When you hit a good shot , admire it . Do n't immediately pick up your tee or walk away . SET A LIFE . Do n't allow golf to be the sole source of your self-esteem . Have other interests that you do well , enjoy , and are rewarding . Perfectionism NO GROUP OF PEOPLE has a harder time with golf than do perfectionists . They have unrealistically high expectations . The beauty of golf is that we all have hit perfect shots . The problem is that we do n't understand why we do n't do it every time . Separate precision from perfection . Golf demands a degree of precision . You must be as meticulous as possible in your set-up and preshot routine . But when precision crosses the line into perfectionism , you have a problem . Certain professions-such as medicine , dentistry , accountingdemand perfection , and it 's difficult to leave that behind on the golf course . People in these fields tend to overaim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it can affect mechanics . They get a lot of information , but ca n't sort it out . It jams their circuits , and they ca n't make a commitment to a shot . That leads to bad shots and when one part of your game starts going badly , it puts pressure on the other parts . Pretty soon , it affects your whole game . SOLUTION ACCEPTANCE . Try to play in a mode of detachment . As we said about fear , bad shots are a part of the game . Lower your expectations and determine what a good shot is for you . Tour players might think a good shot is within 10 feet of the flag . For you , it might be within 10 yards of the green . LET SO OF CONTROL Once again , emphasize process over outcome . Develop your preshot routine and lose yourself in it . The ball does n't care where you hit it and you have no control where it lands . Work on the part for which you are responsible . Watch Corey Pavin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the PGA and Senior PGA Tours . They are precise with set-up , alignment , and visualization . Still , they hit less than perfect shots . However , each shot has a purpose and to watch each player work his way around the course is a thing of beauty They accept bad shots as part of the game and treat them as opportunities to follow with a good shot . Haste THE STORY IS AN OLD but sad one : Hurry to the course , rush through your warm-up and preshot routines ( if you bother with one ) , and haste makes for a wasted day . It 's too difficult to change your tempo during a round . The way you begin is likely to be the way you finish . It 's easy to speed up , but rarely do you slow down . That 's why it 's important to get to the course in a relaxed frame of mind . Only a rare person can spend his day in such a rush and still manage a good round of golf . The rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going badly . If you are a perfectionist and have several unacceptable shots  --  or holes-in a row , you might be prone to give up on the day and start to rush through the rest of the round . Some Tour players tell me they lose interest . I find that a remarkable attitude , especially because golf is their living . Every shot counts , even in a bad round . Being slothful , sloppy , and rushed creates habits that become very difficult to break . Your brain logs the information and stores it . Doing the wrong thing the next time becomes easier . SOLUTION SLOW DOWN . That 's not as easy as it sounds , but you can do some things to help . I have some waltzy , symphonic music in my car , just for riding to the course . It 's not music I normally listen to , but it slows my racing mind and gives me the right pace when I arrive at the course . CHOOSE A ROLE MODEL . Put yourself in the shoes of someone who moves slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mind . They seem to glide to the ball and from shot to shot . SELF.DISCIPLINE . . Make yourself go through your routine , even if you do n't want to . If you fight your way through a rough stretch , it becomes easier the next time . Remember , Jack Nicklaus goes through his routine just as intently on his third putt as he does over a 10-footer to win the U.S. Open . Indecision HOW MANY TIMES have you seen a Tour player spend what seems like minutes discussing club selection and shot selection with his caddie and then hit a bad shot ? The result , most likely , is an inability to decide on a course of action and stick to it . When Bob Tway was mired in his terrible slump , he could n't decide which swing to use . Once he committed to one swing and a course of action to achieve that , he began to play better , resulting in one of the best comeback stories in recent memory People do n't like to make decisions . But not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't cost anything , but it does . It 's been said that Nicklaus might not always have been right , but he was never in doubt . Even a wrong decision can turn out better-with commitment-than no decision . Play your game your way . It maximizes your performance . SOLUTION COMMITMENT . Every shot consists of a series of commitmentsclub , distance , shape , trajectory , and a swing key or two . No matter how good your mechanics may be , if you are not dead certain of what you want to do , the chances are good your shot will come off badly . Again , you must commit to the process . It is amazing just how little thought some Tour players give to making certain critical decisions . Theyand you-must take charge of the game in a structured , systematic manner . Any golf swing that is committed to the process will produce a better shot than a good swing with no commitment . Stubbornness ONE OF THE TRAITS uniquely American is self-sufficiency . We simply do n't want any help . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we repeat the error enough times , eventually it will correct itself . But if we are going to point to the Tour as our barometer , we 'll find that more and more players are asking for help from swing teachers , short game teachers , and mental coaches . These players see the value of another pair of eyes , another opinion , someone to filter their thinking through . They find that asking for help is not a weakness , but a strength . We have mentors in our business careers . We need mentors in golf . You are plain stubborn if you think that one person knows more than two people . So many people try harder , thinking that quantity solves the problem . If a little bit does n't work , they try a lot . Swinging harder , hitting more balls is not where the answer lies . It 's like the drunk who lost his car keys . They were n't under the lamppost , but he was looking there because the light was better . Trying harder is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounds of golf as Tour players play , they learn something from every round . A certain amount of self-sufficiency is desirable . But we must face reality Very few of us can improve our golf games without help . And those of us who can probably will not maximize our potential . If you hope to improve , you must commit to obtaining good advice from a trustworthy source . Schedule a playing lesson with your pro . But do n't tell him what you think you need to work on . Wait until after the lesson and let him suggest improvement priorities . Set up your practices to focus on his suggestions and schedule periodic checkups throughout the season . Hope is part of open-mindedness . When you refuse to have new hope for your game , the game is no longer fun . You ca n't choose the outcome but you can choose how you approach the situation . If you do so with an open mind , the outcome will become acceptable . <p>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
