David Duval has something Tiger Woods probably wishes he had : an aura that unnerves people , that makes them back off . Woods needs bodyguards to clear a path to precious privacy . The 26-year-old Duval , with his buzz cut , reflective wraparound sunglasses , prickly goatee , snuff-packed lower lip and imposing physique , keeps autograph seekers at arm 's length by the force field of his attitude . Woods is magnetic . Ernie Els , Justin Leonard and Phil Mickelson are red-cheeked and lovable . Duval , even though he signs and poses for anyone who dares ask , is impenetrable. // At Georgia Tech , Duval was a pudgy 220 pounds  --  40 more than his current weight  --  yet his teammates called him Rock . The name mostly described his game but also covered the granite mien and gravelly grumbles reserved for strangers who had the temerity to approach him . Last fall , when he ended the season with victories in three straight starts  --  in the Michelob Championship , the Disney and the Tour Championship  --  Duval even stonewalled stardom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after three years , seven second-place finishes and plenty of other disappointing Sundays , he was suddenly the most proficient closer in the game . Personal questions , as usual , were met with controlling pauses and inconclusive answers . Duval is keenly aware of how he is perceived , and not overly troubled by that . " It 's like there should be this asterisk by my name , " he says . " Down at the bottom of the page it would say , ' Difficult to get to know . Easy to misunderstand . ' " // The inaccessibility has deep roots . Considering the blows that Duval absorbed growing up , it should n't come as a surprise that he assumes a peekaboo stance when dealing with the outside world . When Duval was nine , bone marrow was extracted from his hips in an unsuccessful attempt to save the life of his 12-year-old brother , Brent , who had been stricken with aplastic anemia , a blood disorder . The trauma of losing their first child ravaged the marriage of Bob and Diane Duval , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devastating effect that separation and a 1996 divorce had on his mother unsettled Duval . His father 's subsequent remarriage compounded the pain . In the face of so much turmoil , Duval withdrew into himself . Rock is also an island . // " What is , is , " says Duval . Then he unexpectedly elaborates . " My brother died , my parents divorced ... blah , blah , blah . There 's nothing I can do about it . Maybe my mechanism has been not to analyze it because it would only hinder me from going on . The bottom line is , I do n't believe you are given more than you can handle . You have to find a way to cope . You can level your own playing field by understanding that life only becomes fair when you realize it 's unfair . I do n't wonder about or want to share why I am the way I am . I 'm not saying my way is right . It might turn off a lot of people . But it 's the way I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of his father . A former teammate of Hubert Green 's at Florida State and then a club pro for 28 years , Bob Duval was a rookie on the Senior tour last year and in his own way as big a success as his son . Whereas David is wary and private , Bob ( Bobby to his friends ) is talkative , friendly and open . " I can party with the best of them , " says Bob . David , on the other hand , enjoys spending an evening engrossed in a book . Two years ago he read 31 books while playing on the Tour . Last year , he read nearly 20 , including the voluminous Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand . Naturally , David downplays any intellectual bent . " I can work the buttons on a remote control pretty good , too , " he says dismissively . // On the golf course Bob and David are also a study in contrasts . Bob is dark-skinned and stout , Trevinoesque in his banter and bouncy body language . David is pale and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its lack of motion . " We 're opposites , " says David . " My dad looks like there 's no place in the world he 'd rather be . I always look like I 'm ill. " // Some of the differences between the Duvals ' demeanors can be attributed to perspective . At 51 , Bob is having the time of his life . Last season he overcame heavy odds to pull himself from Monday-qualifier status to 28th ( $555,601 ) on the money list , guaranteeing a full exemption this year . He begins 1998 intent on gaining his first win and savoring the hard-earned gravy that 's part of playing on the Senior tour . " I 'm getting the chance to do what I love , " he said before placing 19th in last week 's Royal Caribbean Classic . " I want it to last as long as possible . " // David , because of his talent and drive , is more ambitious . His run at the end of last season and solid start this year  --  he 's sixth on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accuracy and feel to be one of the top players in the game . " In terms of being long and straight , Duval 's the best driver of the ball out here , " says Mark Calcavecchia . " From where he 's hitting his second shots , every golf course is easy , and his short game is as good as his long game . " // " I 've always felt David 's strongest asset as a golfer is his mind , " says his father . " He 's bright , a hell of a lot brighter than I am . I used to get on him for not spending enough time studying , but he always brought home A 's and B 's . It turns out he only has to read something once and he 's got it . I 'm sure he could 've gotten straight A 's if he 'd tried . " // When it comes to analyzing personal issues , though , that mind is blocked , intentionally or otherwise . Asked if the family crisis is what made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't characterize things like that , " he says . " I try to be a doer , not a talker . People tend to talk too much . " Questions , especially in bunches , make him uncomfortable  --  perhaps because he learned so early that sometimes there are no answers . // David does n't remember very much about Brent . " Just little scenes , like flying a kite together or him sticking up for me in a group , or playing pool with him in the hospital , " he says . " I think about him more in October , when his birthday comes up . " David does n't remember undergoing the operation that extracted the marrow . Within two weeks of the procedure , Brent suffered a graft-versus-host reaction that proved fatal . // " David had a lot of problems right after that , " says his father . " He was just a kid , he loved Brent , and he really believed that it was his fault that it did n't work . He became more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , happy or sad . We have never really talked about Brent 's death . It 's always been tough for him to open up , and especially tough for him to trust . " // Told of his father 's recollection that he suffered from guilt , David says , " It 's hard to look back and say either way . " Asked whether the experience had made it difficult for him to trust , he says , " I ca n't really answer that . It would be less than honest . " His face impassive but his discomfort obvious , Duval closes the conversation . " I really do n't remember what it 's like to have a brother , " he says . " It 's like I 've had two separate lives . " // The second one has been immersed in golf . " After Brent died , David became more sensitive and very focused , especially on golf , " says his father . " The game lends itself to loners , and David is a loner , let 's face it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching pro in Schenectady , N.Y. , knew his younger boy had athletic ability but never pushed golf on him . After Brent 's death , David started spending summer days and after-school hours at Timuquana Country Club in Jacksonville , where his father was the pro . " David did n't waste time , " Bob says . " He was putting or on the range or playing with players who were better than him . He was hungry to learn . I could see he had the game inside of him . " // David especially loved to play alone . " My fondest memories in golf are being about 14 or 15 and teeing off at Timuquana by myself on a real foggy morning , " he says . " You could n't see the ball land , you could n't see more than 150 yards , but I could n't wait to play on those days . There were no outside influences , and I was completely into what I was doing . " // Julie McArthur , Duval 's girlfriend for the last five years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " David 's moment of peace is when he hits the course , " says McArthur , a 31-year-old former pharmacist who lives with Duval in Neptune Beach , Fla . " All he knew was he needed to get away from something , and the best way was to go hit balls for hours . It 's still perfect for him , between the ropes , away from everything . Golf is perfect protection , a salvation . It 's almost no wonder he got great at it . " // When Duval was a teenager , his father encouraged him to play friendly matches for money . Bob covered David 's losses and took half his winnings . Because competitiveness is one trait the Duvals do share , they would go hammer and tong against each other on the course . " The first time he beat me , he was 14 , " says Bob . " We 'd play like two golfers  --  it 's always been like that . He did n't ask much and I did n't tell him much , but he knew I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to David 's swing . The boy gripped the club with his hands turned in a pronounced clockwise direction , much " stronger " than what is considered orthodox . On the downswing , his head swiveled markedly toward the target before impact , supposedly a violation of golf 's hoariest fundamental . But when Bob saw the naturalness with which his son kept hitting purely struck shots , he made a decision . " I did n't mess with it , " he says . " My thinking was that his game , his swing , his grip  --  that was the way his body was built . I wanted David to discover the way that was best for him . " // David believes his father 's mission was accomplished . " The biggest and best contribution my dad made was to let me learn on my own and figure out who I am and how I play , " he says . " It taught me to be self-reliant , which I think is important to being a good player . " // David proved to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 he made the cut in the ' 90 U.S. Open , and two years later , between his junior and senior years at Georgia Tech , had a two-shot lead after 54 holes at the BellSouth Classic before fading with a 79 in the final round . When he finished his senior season , in 1993 , Duval had joined Gary Hallberg and Phil Mickelson as the only players in NCAA history to be named first-team All-America four times . He stumbled in his first attempt at Q school but played well enough on the Nike tour in 1994 to qualify for the PGA Tour in ' 95. // Duval was impressive in setting what was then a record for earnings by a rookie , $881,436 , placing him 11th on the money list . His three times as runner-up seemed to bode well , but in ' 96 Duval again failed to win despite two more seconds and three thirds . His most disappointing finish came in May at Atlanta , where he held a two-stroke lead after three rounds but collapsed with a 76 . Throughout his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to grips with his parents ' separation . " David was n't at peace , " says McArthur . " He had n't addressed some personal issues . My opinion was that he was n't going to win until he resolved those things . " // " All our relationships were tested after Brent died , but especially the relationship between myself and Diane , " says Bob . " A lot I do n't remember because I 've selectively blocked it out . Neither my wife nor I was doing so well . I was drinking more than I should have . I was n't happy in the relationship . There were serious problems . " // The Duvals attempted a reconciliation , but finally , in the summer of 1996 , divorced . Soon after , Bob began a new relationship and eventually remarried . Diane sank into depression , and because David remained close to her , his relationship with his father deteriorated . " He told me , ' I do n't like what you 're doing , ' " Bob says . " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is life . ' It was rocky between us for a while . David put his head in the sand , but we finally had some talks . He started listening and seeing it through my eyes . He saw I was happier and better off . " // As he came to terms with his father and Bob 's new wife , Shari , David became a stronger person and player . He encouraged his father , who was a force in club pro events around Jacksonville , to try the Senior tour . " When he told me that he believed in my game , especially after what we had been through , it did a lot for my confidence , " says Bob . David 's confidence was on the rise , too . A controversial captain 's pick for the 1996 Presidents Cup because he had seemed to melt in the heat of contention , Duval proved to be one of the best golfers on the U.S. team with a 4-0 record . About the same time , unhappy with carrying too much weight on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other top players , Duval began a program that became more intense the more progress he made . " I found out I like the feeling of really pushing myself , " he says . " You have to conquer obstacles in life , and working on your body is something where you can see results . It makes me feel better . Maybe because it 's a form of gaining control . The other thing was that it 's clear that the way Tiger plays is the way the game is going . Essentially , I was being a competitor . " // There was one more lingering problem . His mother 's depression had been gnawing at Duval for several months , but he had n't addressed it . " David has this ability to make himself numb , to pretend problems do n't exist , " says McArthur . " He 'll say something is n't affecting him because he can overcome it . I told him , ' Obviously it 's affecting you . If it was n't affecting you , you would n't have to overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David sat down with his mother and opened up . " When I talked to my mom to try to resolve some of her difficulties , it had a good effect on both of us , " he says . " She 's made great strides . In the end it helped me mature . " // According to McArthur , the talks also helped him win . " It absolutely made the difference , " she says . " He was a stronger player mentally down the stretch . It was n't a big difference , but it was all David needed . " // " David has a good handle on life right now , " his father says . " He has faced some things , on and off the course . He 's probably made some decisions that no one will ever know about . Like , ' All right , my mom 's O.K. My dad 's O.K. Hey , I 'm O.K. ' " // That would rank as an asterisk-erasing moment . " Julie said something that made me laugh at myself , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think I 'm a good person ? ' She shot me this look and said , ' Yes . But I know you . ' " Golf 's impenetrable star told the story as if that might actually be a good thing .
