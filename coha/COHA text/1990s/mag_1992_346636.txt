Arthur and Irene Seale saw themselves sharing a chic , moneyed life-style most couples just read about . But the Seales ' frenzied quest for status ended abruptly with charges of kidnapping and extortion in the abduction of Exxon International president Sidney Reso . Now the Seales face a courtroom battle not only against prosecutors but against each other . <P> One week after their arrest , Mrs. Seale led investigators to Reso 's decomposing corpse in a shallow grave in New Jersey 's remote Pine Barrens . She had already described how she and her husband grabbed Reso from his home as he set out for work last April and stuffed him into a sweltering storage facility . She also told how Arthur Seale shot Reso in the arm during a struggle . Autopsy reports have not been made public , but officials are saying Reso died only four days into his captivity . <P> When their federal kidnapping trial begins in September , Irene Seale will be testifying against her husband , who has pleaded innocent to all charges .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
