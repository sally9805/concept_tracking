Section : U.S. News Exxon , Mobil , and Rockefeller 's legacy <p> When Exxon and Mobil officials announced that the companies had agreed to merge last week , the $75 billion megadeal was instantly dubbed " Rockefeller 's revenge . " After all , both Exxon and Mobil trace their lineage directly to John D. Rockefeller Sr. 's once fearsome Standard Oil monopoly . In their former incarnations , the Tiger and the Winged Horse had in fact accounted for over half of the total value of the Standard Oil trust , which the U.S. Supreme Court ordered disbanded in 1911 . <p> Old man Rockefeller might even offer a faint smile if he could know that Amoco , also an offshoot of Standard Oil , recently agreed to be purchased by British Petroleum . Turns out that BP 's U.S. assets largely derive from its absorption of still another Standard Oil scion , Sohio . Rockefeller always argued that two things were essential to the oil industry 's survival : checking " ruinous competition " and " cooperation . " Today , with pump prices hovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the equivalent of roughly 23 cents in 1970 dollars ) , many oil industry executives might wholeheartedly agree . <p> Historical analogies can be overdrawn , to be sure . The Exxon-Mobil combination , if it passes regulatory muster , will be the world 's largest company , enjoying vast market power . But it wo n't be nearly as dominant as its forebear : At its zenith , the trust controlled 84 percent of the U.S. petroleum market . Although exact comparisons are difficult , Exxon Mobil , by contrast , will only control about 22 percent of U.S. gasoline sales . <p> Crude behavior . Still , the conditions that have driven the two companies into each other 's arms have instructive parallels with the past . " The economic environment was absolutely the same in the 1870s , when Rockefeller began the trust , as it is today , " says Ron Chernow , author of Titan , a biography of Rockefeller . Perhaps the most striking parallel between then and now is the worldwide glut of crude oil . When Rockefeller started building his trust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices below the cost of production . Even after Standard Oil achieved a monopoly , oil prices continued to drop . Indeed , the only reason Rockefeller was able to build his fortune was that , through his control of refineries and railroads , he was able to keep the price of refined oil from falling quite as fast as the price of crude . <p> The oil industry has been plagued by oversupply throughout its history . " The challenge has always been to control the surplus , " says Leo Drollas , deputy director of the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London . In 1928 the heads of British Petroleum , Royal Dutch Shell , and Standard Oil met in the Scottish highlands and secretly agreed to limit production in the wake of the huge discoveries in the Middle East . From the late 1940s to the early 1970s , the Texas Railroad Commission , by allocating production in that state , in effect set the U.S. price of crude oil . And exactly 25 years ago the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries , or OPEC , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tripling the world price of petroleum in one year . <p> Today , the industry is producing about 1 million more barrels a day than it is selling . Just finding a place to put all the growing surplus has become tricky , as most conventional storage facilities are already filled to the brim . More than 90 tankers around the world are either employed as or being converted to floating storage tanks . Because of the glut , the price of crude has plunged to a 12-year low  --  the cheapest price on record when adjusted for inflation . A year ago , a barrel of crude fetched $23 ; last week , the going price was about $11 . <p> The main culprit is the sharp decline in demand across Asia . The economic slump has caused oil consumption in that part of the world to drop by 750,000 barrels a day . Falling oil prices not only have compounded problems in Asia by hitting major oil producers like Indonesia but also have helped spread the crisis to Brazil , Russia , and elsewhere . <p> Another reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartel has tried to cut production this year . But widespread cheating by its own members , most notably Venezuela , combined with weakening demand , has left it unable to boost prices . <p> Fuel efficiency . As in Rockefeller 's day , the oil glut creates enormous incentives for consolidation . By merging , Exxon and Mobil can cut overhead costs and enjoy greater efficiencies of scale , just as the Standard Oil trust did . <p> Another factor behind the union is the increasing amount of both financial and political capital needed to develop new sources of oil . Virtually all potential new fields are in geographically remote and politically risky areas , such as West Africa and the Caspian Sea . " Exxon and Mobil are hoping that by combining , they 'll have more power over foreign governments in much the same way that Rockefeller felt he needed a certain critical mass to exert control over railroads , " notes Chernow . <p> Does this mean the U.S. government will just stand by as the oil industry consolidates ? If all the proposed mergers go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much talk of excessive concentration in the 1970s will become the " Three Sisters . " And once the Asia crisis finally subsides and demand for oil rebounds , those three sisters  --  Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell , and British Petroleum-Amoco  --  will likely become immensely more powerful . That means that various political and economic interests will have to be appeased before Exxon and Mobil are allowed to merge . Here 's what to expect : <p> Imagine a huge wall map with 97,448 pins marking all the gasoline stations in the United States . Antitrust officials will examine the map , looking for clusters of Exxon and Mobil stations , the largest concentration of which they will find in the Northeast . Then they will decide how many stations they think the two companies should sell to ensure that consumers still have a choice at the pump . " It is very painstaking , mind-numbing number crunching , " says Robert Litan , director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution and a former antitrust official in the Clinton Justice Department . <p> Meanwhile , state attorneys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their intention to insert themselves into the regulatory review process as well . Their goal is to win concessions that will please the voters back home . Finally , bureaucrats in Brussels , Tokyo , Sydney , and elsewhere are likely to weigh in . Antitrust experts expect the European Union and regulatory programs in other developed countries to set restrictions on Exxon-Mobil operations within their boundaries . " It 's going to be a multiring circus , " Litan says . " But they Exxon Mobil had to have known this . They figured the several million they are going to have to spend on legal fees is a drop in the bucket compared to the advantages of the deal . " <p> The regulators . The Federal Trade Commission will be the lead federal agency reviewing the Exxon-Mobil merger . But the FTC is n't as powerful as it once was . Because of the antiregulatory philosophy of the Reagan-Bush years , the agency is now almost half the size it was at the beginning of the 1980s . " Whether the FTC has the horsepower to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , professor at the University of Baltimore Law School . <p> Exxon and Mobil can count on considerable ideological support from other quarters of the federal government . William Kovacic , a visiting professor at George Washington University Law School , says the deal would never have cleared regulatory hurdles 20 years ago . But antitrust philosophy has changed . " It has turned in the direction of believing you can have a lot of competition even if you do n't have a lot of companies , " he says . " There is awareness that global competition is a very powerful force and that American firms should have flexibility to make adjustments that allow them to better compete overseas . " <p> Critics of the merger argue that gasoline station sell-offs will not address the problem of concentration . Antitrust lawyer Lloyd Constantine , who was a New York regulator in the 1980s , says the big question regulators should consider is whether the price of gasoline will go up . Exxon and Mobil officials will argue that the efficiencies resulting from the merger will allow them to lower retail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhanced . But skeptics fear that the point of the merger is to prop up prices . <p> However the issue is resolved , the legacy of John D. Rockefeller will continue to make itself felt . " The ghost of Standard Oil is going to hover above the antitrust debate , " says Chernow . For Rockefeller , whether he is in heaven or hell , that might be revenge enough . Rockefeller 's revenge <p> On May 15 , 1911 , the U.S. Supreme Court ordered a dissolution of the Standard Oil trust into 34 independent companies , " Dearly beloved , " John D. Rockefeller wrote to his colleagues , " Our splendid , happy family must scatter . " Most family members , however , continue to thrive , and at least several are planning big reunions .

Longman ; Jack Egan ; Marianne Lavelle <p> Section : U.S. News Looking for oil in lots of strange places Petropolitics <p> To understand the political motivations behind the mammoth Exxon-Mobil merger , it helps to know a bit of history about places like Azerbaijan . This oil-rich Caspian nation emerged from Soviet rule in 1991 squeezed between a resentful Russia and a hostile and bristling Iran . Oil firms rushed in to plumb the reserves of the war-torn former republic . But they soon found themselves buffeted by swirling political winds . To avoid having Azerbaijan 's oil pumped through Iran or Russia , Washington is pushing for a far more expensive pipeline from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan , Turkey . That does n't thrill U.S. oil companies . But in complicated places like the Caspian Sea region , the companies ' interests often take a back seat to U.S. strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's largest company , Exxon Mobil will hope to better withstand government pressure . At the same time , the company is also likely to find greater competitive advantages in bidding for new oil exploration deals . " There will be a big opportunity on the playing field to be the big U.S. company , " says Amy Jaffe , an energy expert at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University . " Many countries are looking for an oil company that will bring the attention of the government where it is based . " <p> Out of Africa . That 's especially so in Africa , where the oil is more accessible and easier to export than in the Caspian . Just this year , Exxon has struck oil in three consecutive drilling operations in Angola . Exxon is also proceeding with a $3.5 billion exploration project in Chad , but it is struggling to balance the demands of human rights activists , environmentalists , and the World Bank . <p> The U.S. government could help Exxon Mobil resolve conflicts like those , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the State Department is sponsoring its first conference on African oil prospects with industry representatives . The event is attracting high-level participation , thanks in part to the Clinton administration 's desire to promote American interests in Africa . <p> As exploration continues to proceed in far-flung oil patches like Africa and the Caspian , petroleum companies are also turning their attention back to Persian Gulf oil nations , which are suffering from low oil prices and beginning to consider new exploration deals . This region remains attractive because extraction and transportation costs are low . In October , the Saudi government surprised the oil world by suggesting it would be open to exploring oil-development projects with foreign  --  and , in particular , American  --  oil companies . As the world 's largest oil company , Exxon Mobil would be the natural choice for the first of any such joint ventures . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Exxon Mobil : new clout in the hunt for oil ? <p> By Kevin Whitelaw <p>                @ @ @ @ @
