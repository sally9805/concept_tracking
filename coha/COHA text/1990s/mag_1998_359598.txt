Irvine Welsh , author of Trainspotting , just released his latest novel , Filth , in the U.S. <P> Q : You ordered decaf ? Is n't that kind of wimpy for a guy who writes about drugs ? <P> A : Yeah , totally . But in America they keep pouring you coffee , so I 've had about eight cups of coffee this morning . <P> Q : I hear that you like to write on a drug comedown . I sometimes like to write on a sugar high , so I know what you mean , man . <P> A : That 's why my books are quite nasty . <P> Q : Yeah , there 's not a lot of love in your books . Do you need some love ? <P> A : Yeah , definitely . That 's one of the points of the book : when there is an absence of love , the void is filled by bitterness , manipulation , anger and resentment and unrest . <P> Q : You make the British cops out to be bad guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they do n't even have guns . <P> A : Your cops can blow you away , but they 're not as good at giving kickings in the cells . Ours are the best at that . <P> Q : What 's the worst you 've ever been hassled by cops ? <P> A : When I was about seven or eight years old , I got arrested with some friends for playing football in the streets . I was in the housing projects , where they had all these rules . <P> Q : Do you still do drugs ? <P> A : Of course . <P> Q : But not heroin , right ? <P> A : Not for a while . It was never a drug I really enjoyed . It got to that stage where you 're not real social . You become a liar and a thief as well , which is n't very good . <P> Q : Are you afraid that you have fewer American readers than you would if you did n't write in Scottish dialect ? <P> A : Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to understand a word . <P> Q : I have n't understood anything you 've said . I 'm going to have to make most of it up . Oh , well , thanks anyway . <P>  --  By Joel Stein
