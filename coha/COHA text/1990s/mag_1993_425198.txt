<p> Eight smart ways to make real in-roads to deficit reduction  --  and make smart investments <p> In December 1992 , two of Bill Clinton 's top economic advisors , Roger Altman and Lawrence Summers , wrote the president-elect a private memorandum wargaming the first Clinton budget 's economic goals . The two men  --  they are now top deputies to Lloyd Bentsen at the Treasury  --  argued that a deficit-reduction target which stabilized the growth of debt to the growth of the economy ( a figure that turned out to be $500 billion ) was " the least ambitious deficit target that is defensible . " Guess what target the President settled on ? Not surprisingly , $500 billion . <p> When Congress finally passed the plan by the landslide margins of two votes in the House and one vote in the Senate this summer , the president hit the hustings . " Now we can truly say change has come to America , " Clinton announced at one rally at the State Capitol in my old hometown of Charleston , West Virginia . <p> Or has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission , what Clinton got this year was the bare minimum . The Congressional Budget Office 's own figures , too , indicate that the public debt will actually grow from 52.5 percent of the gross domestic product in 1993 to 54.6 percent by 1998 and still higher thereafter  --  meaning that the $500 billion was n't enough to begin with . So despite the President 's cheerful words , true change wo n't come until Washington clears out the kudzu of stubborn subsidies , untouched benefits for the well-off , and tax loopholes that escaped pruning this year . <p> In that spirit , the Monthly would like to suggest how Clinton and Congress can free up money to cut the deficit and help pay for programs that are really needed . They were on the right track when they expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit and raised the top income tax rates  --  steps which put money in the pockets of the working poor while making the rich pay their fair share . Only 4,442 West Virginia families will pay higher income taxes while 105,000 families will get tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This is only the first step . While Clinton has tried to push a few of our cost-cutting ideas through Congress  --  freezing federal pay and ending ludicrous subsidies  --  Capitol Hill has resisted . We hope the President presses on , adopts the ideas he has n't already , and that Congress will see the wisdom in taking money from bureaucrats , well-off entitlement junkies , and speculators to pay for rebuilding our roads and bridges , providing universal health care , and investing in education to create a better workforce . <p> Take just one example : Each year , the United States admits 800,000 new legal immigrants without investing in rudimentary training in English . These people , once in the workforce , could jumpstart the economy for everybody . But there is no federal money to teach them English , and churches in New York are holding lotteries for limited spaces in volunteer classes . As Bilga Abramova , a 35-year-old Russian refugee , told The New York Times at her third time through such a lottery , " My future is on hold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do not want to depend on welfare . That is shameful . " <p> So for the deficit chickens on both sides of the aisle , and for Clinton , here are cuts that would give people like Ms. Abramova a chance : <p> Freeze federal salaries . Savings : $29 billion by 1998 . <p> One of Clinton 's most courageous stands this year , sadly lost in the fallout from Cristophe 's tarmac coiffing and the succession of Nannygates , was targeting the 2 million-strong federal civilian workforce ( total payroll=$107 billion ) for a pay freeze . Too tough on the feds ? Consider this : Civil servants make an average of $36,279 in the U.S. and $45,000 in Washington ; pay can go as high as six figures-plus for top bureaucrats . Meanwhile , the average private sector worker makes $26,758 , and only 10 percent of private workers make as high a salary as a third of civil servants do . <p> Nevertheless , the well-connected federal employee unions wanted a 2.2 percent pay raise worth $3.1 billion in 1994 . A big problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is that they are based on job descriptions written by the feds themselves , not on the job they really do . That means the responsibilities of a file clerk , with minimal literary flair , can begin to sound a lot like Julius Caesar 's . The government then takes these embroidered descriptions to companies , who read them and say what a comparable job in the private sector would pay . But because the descriptions are inflated , so are the private salaries on which comparability is based . The feds also wanted an additional $1.8 billion in " locality pay " to pay workers who live in costly cities more than those who live in cheaper ones . While it makes sense to pay workers who live in Los Angeles or New York City more to get by , there ought to be corresponding locality pay cuts for civil servants who live in places like Arkansas or Tennessee where federal salaries ( set by Washington standards ) make the local federal administrator better paid than the local bank president . Moreover , in a classic bureaucratic con @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the locality calculation in order to drive up the locality raise , the justification for which would often disappear entirely if the benefit package were taken into account . <p> Clinton rightly proposed killing the 2.2 percent raise , and though he should have tried to focus locality raises in the expensive cities where they are really needed , he did by to delay the scheme . This would have saved $28.7 billion over five years  --  66 percent of Clinton 's discretionary savings in his original budget . But he got rolled , with employees ' unions railroading lawmakers into authorizing the spending . Yet there 's still hope : The money to pay for the double-barreled raises has to be specifically appropriated by Congress by January . The President ought to press for a rollback and go again for the jugular in 1994 . This is big money , going to people who are better paid and have considerably better benefits than what corporate America offers its employees . <p> And while Al Gore 's recommendation to eliminate 252,000 jobs is promising , that 's just 12 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster in the eighties , it cut 61 percent and gained market share . Union Carbide has cut 22 percent and is planning more ; in 1992 , it was the best performer in Dow Jones industrials , rising 92 percent . Losing 20 percent of federal employees saves an additional $9 billion a year . To encourage new investments to put victims of downsizing back to work , see our plan for capital gains on page 34 . See " Myth Information , " Jon Meacham , July/August 1993 , " Building America To Last , " Matthew Miller , January/February 1992 , and " How to Cut the Bureaucracy in Half , " Scott Shuger , June 1990 . <p> Raise the civil service retirement age to 62 . Savings : $5 billion by 1998 . Defer cost of living adjustments ( COLAs ) for federal and military pensioners until age 62 and means test them thereafter . Savings : at least $6.5 billion by 1998 . <p> Another bureaucratic scam is the sweet deal retired federal government employees and military retirees enjoy from government pensions , which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $60 billion a year Washington spends on federal retirement is more than the government spends a year on higher education , consumer safety , Aid to Families with Dependent Children , food stamps , AIDS research , and low-income housing combined . And the big trouble is ahead . The government 's " unfunded pension liability "  --  the amount by which planned pension benefits outstrip workers ' contributions  --  in the federal civil service alone is $600 billion . Add in military expectations and the total exceeds $1 trillion . That 's just at the federal level-states , cities , and towns are facing an aggregate liability of $160 billion to $450 billion . <p> A major cause of this federal shortfall is that civil servants can retire with full benefits at age 55 after 30 years of service . That 's why 362,892 federal civil pensioners  --  or one in four  --  are still in their fifties . Servicemen and  --  women can retire after 20 years , while they are still in their early forties , and as a result 90 percent of military retirees are nondisabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can therefore become double or even triple dippers , bringing in a government pension , Social Security , and possibly a third pension from a mid-life job . There 's nothing wrong with that , of course , so long as the rest of us are n't footing the bill for overly generous pensions and cost-of-living adjustments that grow faster than inflation . Just raising the civilian retirement age to 62 would raise $5 billion over five years . <p> COLAs in government pensions were uncommon until the years after 1969 , when the country was at last paying the bills for Vietnam and was suffering the shocks of two giant oil price hikes . That period of inflation ended about 1982 , but the government retiree programs continued to fund generous COLAs  --  now a $2 billion a year tab  --  and federal employee and military retirees came to look on the COLAs not as a temporary helping hand in inflationary times but as an entitlement . <p> Instead of adjusting COLAs downward when inflation fell or giving them only to people whose overall income is low , COLAs became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government and the private sector on this is vast : In 1991 , all federal employees and 50 percent of state and local employees had this benefit . How many private sector workers had it ? Just 5 percent . <p> COLAs have gone wrong for two reasons . First , they are compounded every year , piling COLA on top of COLA . Second , they are applied indiscriminately to all retirees instead of protecting the marginal pensioner from inflation . Deferring COLAs until age 62  --  hardly onerous  --  would save $6.5 billion over five years . Means testing the COLAs for well off pensioners would save even more money while protecting those on the margin . See " A Pension for Trouble , " Matthew Cooper , July/August 1989 . <p> Means-test Social Security COLAs . Savings : $8.25 billion by 1998 . <p> We are delighted that Clinton and Congress agreed to tax 85 percent of Social Security benefits , but this is just the first step toward a sane Social Security system . Because of increases in the Social Security tax in the eighties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent while the system funded the retirements of the Rockefellers and silver-haired Rotarians at two to 10 times the amount they paid in . Though we would prefer that the working poor and lower middle class receive breaks and that the affluent pay taxes on 100 percent of benefits ( and would really prefer a means test to strip the rich of Social Security benefits altogether if their income is more than $100,000 a year ) , there are signs of support for means testing COLAs for Social Security . <p> On the night the Senate passed the Clinton package , Senator Alan Simpson went on ABC 's " Nightline " to discuss the vote . There , guest host Barbara Walters pressed Simpson on issues where the Republicans might join ranks with Democrats in the coming year . " You 're going to help on entitlements ? " Walters asked Simpson , who answered : " Sure . But Al Gore talked to me just after the election and he was talking about something we all ought to talk about . We have to do something with cost-of-living allowances for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do these things and we have to do it together . This is where you join hands and go over a cliff . " <p> It 's a leap worth taking , and we hope Simpson is serious about federal retiree pensions and about Social Security . According to the CBO , freezing Social Security COLAs across the board for just one year would save a whopping $46 billion by 1998 . However , we believe in protecting the person who 's living on the edge and genuinely needs a COLA to keep up with the cost of living . Why not pay the full COLA for people making less than , say , $20,000 a year , and take it away from those with more than $50,000 of household income ? According to data analyzed by Phillip Longman and Neil Howe for The Atlantic in 1992 , 20 percent of Social Security 's outlays  --  or $55 billion  --  go to households making more than $50,000 . Take the COLA away from them and you save roughly $8.25 billion by 1998 , assuming 3 percent inflation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that in the eighties , Social Security , Medicare , and federal pension benefits paid to households making over $200,000 doubled . Meanwhile , households with incomes less than $10,000 lost 7 percent of their federal benefits . The vote to tax 85 percent of benefits  --  and Simpson 's remarks  --  shows that there is a realistic possibility we can stop wasting money on people who are already affluent . See " The W-2 Step , " James Bennet , June 1991 . <p> Limit the home mortgage deduction to a set percentage . Savings : $21 billion by 1998 . <p> Home ownership is so much a part of the postwar American world that you 'd think only an Eddie Haskell affecting a Socialist pose would suggest the great picket-fenced middle class is ripping the country off . But homeowners can deduct mortgage interest expenses from their taxable income-even though homes do not produce any taxable income . The case for such deductions is based on the not unreasonable assumption that they encourage home ownership and improvement . That 's true , of course , but the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , although no other kind of consumer interest has been deductible since 1991 , home mortgages amount to a $50 billion yearly subsidy from all taxpayers to homeowners . <p> Capping the deduction at just $12,000 for single filers and $20,000 per joint return would quickly raise $21 billion , and these limits are higher than what 95 percent of homeowners claim . If these caps were adopted , the CBO says , only mortgages of $250,000 or more would lose any of the deduction , and only 4 percent of new mortgages in 1992 were in that high priced range . This way , only those people well-off enough to consider luxury homes or vacation houses would be affected at all . <p> Cancel the space station and the Supercollider . Savings : $16.5 billion by 1998 . <p> There 's more nibbling going on around these two behemoth projects than at a lobbyist-sponsored cocktail buffet , but the clear answer is to be done with them both . The space station has already soaked up $9 billion with no objective or end in sight . If NASA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they host a permanent slumber party in space ? The same goes for the Supercollider , the darling of **28;721;TOOLONG Senators Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison . While Clinton reduced the size of the projects cloaked in rhetoric about " smaller , more focused missions , " there are too many problems back here on Earth to justify shooting billions into space and into research about radioactive decay . <p> Freeze for Medicare payments to hospitals for one year ; lower subsidies to high income recipients ; strip surgeons of their raises for Medicare-funded patients . Savings : $22 billion by 1998 . <p> We are wary of proposing too much on Medicare because we hope the Clinton health plan , which will surely involve a restructuring of Medicare , will give the rich and poor equal access to the same level of care . Still , there are a few money-saving steps that could immediately be taken . <p> First , for all the squawking about the $56 billion in Medicare " cuts " this year , only the program 's automatic growth was somewhat limited . Freezing payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would force hospitals to be more efficient . House Republicans sensibly proposed means testing the Medicare deductible for beneficiaries making over $100,000 to make them pay the first $2,000 of hospital costs instead of the current $697 . Also , cutting subsidies on Medicare 's supplemental insurance for couples making $125,000 and phasing the subsidy out for those making over $200,000 would bring in $6 billion . <p> One glaring mistake ought to be corrected right away . In the budget deal , Clinton and Congress raised the government subsidy to one of the richest sections of society : surgeons . By including surgeons in the 8.9 percent raise in the fee schedule  --  mean U.S. surgical income is now $223,800 , compared to $111,500 for family doctors  --  the Democrats caved to a major special interest . How 's that for shared sacrifice ? <p> Raise the estate tax and close the angel-of-death loophole . Savings : about $80 billion by 2000 . <p> As we have pointed out in recent issues of the magazine , the new way to get rich quick in this country is to inherit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on between baby boomers and their parents , who are dying off . And 97 percent of estates now go untaxed . Changing that and closing the angel-of-death-loophole which exempts capital gains tax on stock sold after it 's inherited would raise , by some estimates , $80 billion by the year 2000 . See " Brother , Can You Spare My BMW ? " David Segal , April 1993 , and " The Secret Solution to the Deficit , " Paul Glastris , January/February 1991 . <p> Give capital gains tax breaks to investments in new jobs . Savings : billions . <p> The more businesses and governments downsize to make themselves efficient , the more people will be out of work . This could have the terrible result of cutting the number of customers these new , lean corporations will have  --  and the number of taxpayers for the government  --  unless new plants and businesses are opening to take up the slack . <p> While Congress passed a break for small business capital gains held for over five years , it 's imperative that Clinton keep his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and start-ups across the board . Now , the tax code makes no distinction between the investor who takes a risk by investing in a new company and who sells , say , five years and so many new jobs later and the speculator who buys 10,000 shares of AT &T; on Monday and sells them on Tuesday . The first man deserves a tax break ; the speculator , whose in-and-out trading encourages company managers to maximize short term profits at the expense of the long term good of the company ( and , in the big picture , of the economy ) , should n't get a break . Now , investors pay 28 percent capital gains regardless of whether it 's a job-producer or a speculation ; making short termers pay the same higher rate on their stock deals that they pay on ordinary income will save billions . And a targeted cut will encourage investors to put their money where it counts : Investments that mean new jobs . See " No Dollars , Common Sense , " Charles Peters , December 1992 . <p> Our suggestions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come to about $610 billion by 1998 . They ask something of we would not put all of these savings toward deficit reduction . A third of it , about $200 billion , should go to making good public investments in roads , education , and health care . Now that 's real change . <p> by Charles Peters <p> <p> Charles Peters is editor in chief of The Washington Monthly . Research assistance was provided by Steven Rosenfeld . <p>
