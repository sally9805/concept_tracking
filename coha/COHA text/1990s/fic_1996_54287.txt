They say that we Photographers are a blind race at best : that we learn to look at even the prettiest faces as so much light and shade ; that we seldom admire , and never love . <p>  --  Lewis Carroll , A Photographer 's Day Out The reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson , the logician and photographer and lesser-known mirror image of Lewis Carroll , first met Alice Liddell when she was three . John Ruskin , a fellow lecturer at Oxford , was also smitten with young Alice , and later became obsessed with twelve-year-old Rose La Touche . Edgar Allan Poe married his thirteen-year-old cousin Virginia . Dante fell in love with Beatrice when she was eight and a half . <p> If you expect me to add my name to this list , you 're out of your mind . <p> * * * " He was terrified of the night , " she said , softly . " Terrified of dreaming , I think . Even beds frightened him . " <p> I nodded . I do n't remember any nighttime scenes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even Sylvie and Bruno , and the only mention of a bed to come to mind was " summon to unwelcome bed/A melancholy maiden ! /We are but elder children , dear , /Who fret to find our bedtime near . " The hunters of the Snark " hunted till darkness came on , " with not a word of what happened afterward , and Sylvie and Bruno Concluded ends land not a moment too soon ) with the stars appearing in a bright blue sky . True , " The Walrus and the Carpenter " is set at midnight , and features an oyster-bed , but the sun stays up the whole time . <p> " How did you meet ? " <p> Alice smiled prettily , without showing the tips of her teeth . " In London , outside a theater  --  the Lyceum , I think . I 'd seen him before , but I had no idea who he was . When I told him my name , he said , ' So you are another Alice . I 'm very fond of Alices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Winter . I do n't remember the year , but he was about thirty , and he had n't written Wonderland yet , and I think Prince Albert was still alive . Eighteen sixty , maybe . " I nodded . Dodgson was a compulsive diarist , but many of his diaries disappeared after his death , like his letters to Alice Liddell , and all of his photographs and sketches of naked little girls . <p> I suppose it started in the darkroom , at home : developing old , half-forgotten rolls of film is the safest form of time travel ; you do n't need a license , or even a seat belt . This roll had been in the Nikon for at least a year , and when I finally sat down with the proof sheet and a glass of Glenfiddich , I was ready to see anything . Forty minutes and two glasses later , I was still wondering why the hell I 'd taken five shots of Folly Bridge . Granted that it 's where the famous rowing expedition and the story of Wonderland started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as often as I 'd like , it 's been photographed more often than Capa shot " Death in the Afternoon . " <p> There was nothing mysterious about any of the other shots , at least to me . On the proof sheet , they all look harmless enough  --  a busy street in Bangkok , far enough from Patpong to be safe ; a beach near Townsville ; a park in Tokyo ; the Poe Cottage in Philadelphia ; a slum in Brasilia or Rio . An extremely observant eye ( such as Poe 's ) would notice a particularly beautiful little girl in almost every shot  --  never in the center , but always perfectly in focus . She is n't the same girl . She 's always the same girl . She always has dark hair , black or almost black ; pale skin ; large eyes . Small , slight , almost elfin . The girl in Townsville is probably no older than ten ; the girl in Bangkok may be twelve or twenty or anywhere in between . She is n't the same girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is  --  <p> I stared at the photographs of Folly Bridge ; five shots , from slightly different perspectives , but all from the St. Aldates side . Long shadows  --  evening , probably just before sunset . And no girl . Where the hell did she go ? <p> I slept badly that night , but without disturbing anyone . My dreams were obscene ; you do n't need the details , except that the girl from Folly Bridge was . . . there . <p> She was smaller than the ideal , with the creamy pallor of the Londoner who ca n't afford to buy a tan . Her hair was short , but extremely untidy . Her eyes were too dark , impossibly dark , and her smile remained long after the dream had ended . It was not the smile of a little girl . It was the smile of something older , and wiser , and very hungry . <p> I woke shivering , expecting to find the sheets drenched with sweat or worse . Instead , they were completely dry , and cold , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbara is far and away the best secretary I 've ever had . She 's a law school dropout , efficient , intelligent , computer literate , multilingual , empathic , diplomatic , moderately ambitious , extremely attractive , and devoutly gay ; we 've been having breakfast together for four years now , without ever misunderstanding each other ( well , not seriously ) . Two of the juniors , both avid prosecutors , were sitting at a table near the door discussing the latest batch of ripper murders that were splattered across all the papers . A pot of coffee and a cherry Danish were waiting for me in my booth , and so was Barbara . <p> " Rough night ? " she murmured , as I sat down . <p> I nodded . " What have I got today ? " <p> " Partners ' meeting at eight , Druitt arriving at ten and the Mirror 's lawyers at eleven , political lunch , " she grimaced slightly , " at the at two  --  " <p> " Oh , God , is that today ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Good . What about tomorrow morning ? Am I in court ? " <p> " No . Not until Friday . You have two  --  " <p> " Postpone them . " <p> She keyed something into her notebook without even blinking . " Where are you going ? " <p> " Oxford . " <p> Sullivan ( okay , so that is n't his real name ) was a numbers man for the Tories , known to his colleagues as the Lord High Executioner . If he ever invites you to lunch , hire a taster . I was still sitting down when he muttered , " I hear the Mirror settled . " <p> He obviously had excellent hearing for a man his age ; we 'd signed the papers less than twenty minutes before . I merely grunted . " I hope it was expensive ? " he probed . <p> " My client 's reputation is worth a lot of money . " <p> " So is yours , by now . " He smiled . Like most of the people who run most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a reputation ; you probably still do n't know who I 'm talking about . A waiter appeared , and I ordered carpetbag steak and a good burgundy . Sullivan waited until he was gone , then asked , " Are you planning to stay in London long ? " <p> " I go where the firm sends me , " I replied , " but I think I 'll be here for a few years yet . I 'd certainly prefer to ; it beats hell out of New York . " <p> He smiled . " Good . I wo n't waste your time , or mine . Have you ever considered a career in politics ? " I shrugged . " All right . What if I said there was going to be a safe seat vacant before the next election ? " <p> " I 'm not interested , " I replied , without any hesitation . <p> " Think about it . This is n't America ; you would n't have to quit your practice . I know what you 're worth  --  believe me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salaries are pitifully low : even the travel allowance is n't much of a compensation . But you would n't have to give any of it up . I have n't ; you know that . " I nodded ; he 'd been a client of ours for many years " Hell , you already give away more money than most rock stars , more than most people can even dream about . All those kids you sponsor , all those donations to UNICEF and refugees  --  oh , do n't look so bloody surprised . You really thought nobody knew ? Welcome to the twentieth century , or what 's left of it . " <p> I said nothing . <p> " I 'm not going to bullshit you , " he lied . " I do n't know why you do it , what you get out of it , but I do n't care , either , if it 's what you want to do . But if you really want to help the street kids or starving Thais or whoever , you 'll consider my offer very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because I know you can win . You always do .

" He paused , leaning back in his chair . " And I 'll be honest . I know the other parties have n't approached you yet , and I know they will , and I know we can double whatever they offer . " <p> " You can relax , " I assured him . " I 'll tell them the same thing I told you I 'm not interested . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> " For one thing , I do n't believe it 'll be as easy as you make out . I 'm single , and I 've lived most of my life in the States . Secondly , it 's not what I want to do . Thirdly , I 've never intended to become a public figure ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sullivan snorted . " Like I said , this is n't America ; we do n't expect politicians to be moral paragons . We 've had too many kings , and far too many princes ; nobody gives a damn if an MP 's not married , or if he bonks his secretary occasionally . Besides , you were born here , your father was some sort of war hero , you grew up in Boston so you speak better English than . half the BBC , and you 're a Rhodes scholar to boot . As for your private life , all right , I know you ca n't give a lecture without honking one of the students , but what does that matter ? They 're all girls , are n't they ? " <p> I looked at him , and said nothing . He was probably right about English politicians ' private lives ; nobody 's ever given him any shit about the curious resemblance between his twenty-seven-year-old second wife and his fifteen-year-old daughter . The wife 's not brilliant , but I 'm sure she 's guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , they 're all girls . " <p> " And all over sixteen . " He waved his fat fingers dismissively , then shut up as the waiter returned with our lunch . " All right . At least consider it . I do n't need an answer for another week . " <p> I parked near the corner of Thames and St. Aldates , and stared at Folly Bridge , wondering if it had ever deserved its name so thoroughly before . The urge to turn the Jag around and return to London was almost palpable . Instead , I took a deep breath , unbuckled my seat belt , opened the door , and stepped out into the thin October sunshine . Having come this far , the least I could do was visit some of the booksellers . Besides , it was a week before Michaelmas term , and I could wander around the colleges again without hordes of undergraduates making me feel like a fossil . <p> It was past six and almost dark when I headed back to the carpark , footsore from the cobbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my briefcase . There was a girl standing outside Alice 's Shop , staring into the window , though the shop had been closed for over an hour . She turned when she heard me , and we stared at each other across the road . <p> I knew , even before I saw her face , that it was the little girl from my nightmare . She was small , maybe nine or ten years old , wearing ripped jeans , sneakers , and a very baggy sweatshirt ; her shoulder-length dark hair might have been loosely curled or merely tangled . She leaned back against the window , her right hand cupped before her , in what must have been a deliberate imitation of Dodgson 's photograph of Alice Liddell as a beggar-girl . <p> I stood there frozen for a moment , and then a tourist bus passed between us , blocking my view . Hastily , I turned and resumed walking south ; when I looked back , over my shoulder , she was gone . I hurried along , not even wanting to wonder why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reached the carpark , and she followed me all the way to the Jag . I fumbled for the remote and unlocked the door , almost expecting her to rush ahead of me and climb in . Instead , she disappeared while my back was turned , and I slid into the seat and locked myself in . I sat there for a moment , breathing heavily , then turned the headlights on . She was standing in front of the car , close enough that the lights illuminated the Oxford crest on her dirty sweatshirt but not her face . After a moment 's hesitation , I reached across and unlocked the passenger side door , and waited . I heard the door close again , and she was on me ; I felt her bite , and saw nothing . <p> The contents of my wallet were spread across the passenger seat when I opened my eyes again , but nothing seemed to be missing except the girl . I examined myself in the mirror ; I looked bleary-eyed and slightly disheveled , and maybe a little pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 7:56 . If I hurried , I could be back in London by nine . <p> I decided to work late on Thursday , finishing a paper for the Harvard Law Review , but sent Barbara home in time for her karate class as a reward for not asking any embarrassing questions . The words I needed , exactly the right words , seemed to appear on the monitor as soon as I knew what I wanted to say ; normally , when I write , there seems to be a block between my head and my hands , and everything I try to say clunks and screeches , and I spend hours facing the window rather than stare at the screen . This night , I became so absorbed in my work that it was well after midnight when I looked at my watch and realized why my coffee was so cold and the chambers had become so quiet ; everyone else even the Hatter , who still lives on Eastern Standard Time had departed , leaving me utterly alone . I looked out the window again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was cold , and the rain had slowed to a drizzle , almost a mist . The whole city felt somber and slimy and strange . The streets were deserted , and the only noise was the faint growl of the Jag and the occasional short hiss as something or someone appeared from the gloom and I had to brake . The statue of Eros looked more like a vampire , and I thought I saw some shadows move beneath it as I passed , a huddle of junkies or a bag lady with a shopping trolley . Driving through London protected by tinted glass and electronic locks always feels wrong , somehow , even in filthy weather ; on good days , I feel as though I 'm cruising ( or catacombing , as my Texan cousins call it ) ; bad nights , I just feel like a voyeur . <p> As soon as I arrived home , I closed all the curtains and turned on all the lights , then chose a CD at random and turned the stereo up full blast . It was n't enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company flat ; even the paintings are investments ) , but at least it felt warm and relatively secure . <p> Most of the partners decorated their rooms with the inevitable Spy caricatures of judges ; I prefer to leave the judges outside when I can , and my taste in art runs more to Brian Frouds and Patrick Woodroffes . My private library clashes with the rest of the leatherbound decor , but what the Hell . I collapsed on the couch , and reached for my much-thumbed copy of Faeries . The little girls scattered among the horrors and grotesquerie looked so clean , so innocent , so ethereal . A pretty elf looked back at me with almond-shaped night-shaded eyes , for all the world like  --  <p> I dropped the book , which fell open to the sketch of Leanan-Sidhe . " On the Isle of Man , " the text read , " she is the blood-sucking vampire and in Ireland the muse of poets . Those inspired by her live brilliant , though short , lives .

Here 's Mr. Dodgson drunk all my tea , and I have n't got any left ! " So I am very much afraid , next time Sybil looks for you , she 'll find you by the sad sea wave , and crying " Boo ! hoo ! Here 's Mr. Dodgson has drunk my health , and I have n't got any left ! " <p>  --  Lewis Carroll , letter to Gertrude Chataway , 1875 I looked through the peephole . It was her , of course , still in the same dirty sweatshirt and tattered jeans . I drew a deep breath , and then opened the door slightly . She smiled . <p> " Can I come in ? " She had a little girl 's voice , a rather thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marilyn Monroe with a hint of Oxford accent . Her tone was curious , rather than arrogant or imploring ; her eyes merely watchful . <p> " Can I stop you ? " I asked , only half joking . The building was supposed to be impregnable ; even if she 'd managed to sneak through the lobby while the doorkeeper was busy , there were cameras in every lift and corridor . " How did you get here ? " <p> " By coach , and bus . Your address was in your wallet . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Are n't you going to invite me in ? " <p> " Who are you ? " <p> " My name 's Alice , " she replied , as though that were an answer . <p> " What are you ? " <p> She paused , smiling with her eyes as though she were trying to invent something . " What do I look like ? " she asked , finally . " Are n't you going to invite me in ? " <p> " What will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go away , " she replied , " and not come back . " <p> I stood there , trying to convince myself that it was stupid to be scared of a little girl , barely half a meter high , no matter how dark her eyes were . I tried to imagine myself shutting the door , and going on with my life . And then I stepped back , and let her in . <p> " What do you want ? " I asked , after she 'd folded herself up on the chaise longue , her arms around her knees . <p> " What do you want ? " she replied , still looking around curiously . <p> " I asked first . " <p> " A place to stay during the day , " she replied . " Some new clothes . An alibi , occasionally . And maybe you could drive me somewhere , sometimes . I do n't know how long I 'll want to stay ; probably a couple of weeks , maybe a month . Your turn . " <p> " Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " What are you offering ? " <p> Her eyes lit up , suddenly ; she 'd noticed the open book on the couch , and the rest of the library . " You 've got a lot of Alice books . How many ? " <p> " Forty-two . " <p> " Holy shit  --  oh , sorry . Why ? " <p> " Different illustrators . " <p> She nodded . " You must know a lot about Lewis Carroll . " <p> " No , not really . There 's a lot about him that no one knows . " <p> " I could tell you some of it . I knew him . " <p> I sat down opposite her , and tried not to smile . " How old are you ? " <p> " I do n't really know . Eight or nine . " <p> " He died in eighteen ninety-eight , " I said , gently . <p> She looked at me , impatiently . " I know . He got sick just after Christmas , and died a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after he did n't come back . I was still in Oxford ; he could hardly take me with him to his sisters ' home , could he ? <p> " Do n't look at me like that ; you know I 'm not making this up . " <p> " Then you must be a hundred years old , at least . " <p> She shook her head indignantly ; I think she would have stamped her foot , if she 'd been standing up . " I 'm eight years old , and I 'll always be eight years old . That was what he wanted . That 's why he loved me . <p> " I knew him , " she repeated , " and I knew things about him that he did n't even tell his diary , things that no one else remembers . I can tell you what I know , and I 've told you what I want in return . Do we have a deal ? " <p> " How do you know it 's what I want ? " <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the way one laughs at a child . " I saw you when you came to Oxford last summer  --  June , was it ? " <p> " July . " <p> " I saw you looking in Alice 's shop , and in Christ Church , saw you looking up at his rooms . . . . And you took my photograph . You pretended you were just taking a picture of Folly Bridge . Have you printed that photo yet ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " I was n't in it , was I ? " <p> " No . " <p> She nodded . " He found that , when he brought me up to Oxford for some photographs . I did n't know ; photographs were new and strange , then , almost magic , and very expensive . That 's how he found out what I was . I 'd never even seen myself in a looking-glass , and I did n't know that I never could ; looking-glasses were for the rich , and clean water I could see myself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't even remember seeing myself naked before  --  " <p> " You 're a vampire . . . " I whispered . <p> She laughed , a little sadly . " ' This must be the wood where things have no names , ' " she quoted . " ' I wonder what 'll become of my name when I go in ? I should n't like to lose it at all  --  because they 'd have to give me another , and it would almost certainly be an ugly one . ' " She looked at the mirror over the bar , and said , " You can call me a vampire , if you like . I always think of vampires as male . We usually call ourselves sidhe , or mara , or succubi , or even lamia . But do n't worry , I promise not to bite . " " You bit me in Oxford . " <p> She pouted . " Not badly ; I did n't take any more than I needed . You 'll be okay . We do live off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick the next day , or depressed , but we do n't leave any scars , and we try to give them time to recover . Nowadays , we mostly survive on suicides and roadkill and junkies who 're going to die anyway ; we leave before the ambulance arrives , and no one notices if the bodies are missing a pint or two of blood . . . . Maybe that 's why they say suicides become vampires . Of course , they do n't , or the world 'd be full of them . Us . <p> " And there are the symbiotes , who know what we are  --  mostly artists or writers . They give us blood , and we give them dreams . " <p> I slept badly that night . Knowing that there 's a vampire in your guest room makes it difficult to relax , and I was terrified of what I might dream . <p> Why did n't I just throw her out ? Maybe because I was n't sure that I could , was n't sure what she 'd do to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nearly forty years . Maybe she knew  --  <p> I had no experience buying clothes for little girls , but I did n't want to tell anyone about Alice ( not even Barbara ) , and I could n't take her shopping until she had something better than her Oxford rags . I stopped at a Marks &; Sparks on the way home and bought a collection of garments that were roughly the right size . They looked wrong on her when she first tried them on , wrong as a gymslip on a page three girl , but she was a good enough actress to get away with it . <p> She spent the night telling me about her first encounter with Dodgson . " He asked if he could write to my mother , to get her permission . Anna , my teacher  --  another sidhe  --  was working at the theater , so I told him she was my mother . <p> " His rooms were full of books  --  and toys , of course , but I remember the books better . Anna was teaching me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . When he saw how fascinated I was , he gave me a few books , to keep . I do n't think it was meant as a bribe , though he always regarded Londoners as horribly commercial  --  he was a terrible snob . <p> " He photographed me in his rooms  --  this was before they let him build a studio on the roof  --  and let me watch as he developed the plates in a closet . . . . I had n't really known what to expect , and I think he was too surprised to be frightened . Every time I visited him , after that , he had more books on ghosts and things like that  --  The Wonders of the Invisible World , The History of Apparitions , The Vampire . . . most of it crap . They were easily gulled in those days . Arthur Conan Doyle even believed in fairies . . . . <p> " I met the Liddell girls a few times . They were snobs , too , especially Alice , but angels compared to their mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beautiful and knew it , and everyone loved her ; men , women , even a prince . . . " <p> " You ? " <p> " I liked her . I did n't expect to , but I did . " <p> " And Dodgson ? " <p> She shrugged . " Dodgson loved all of them , like he loved most pretty girls who were willing to trust him  --  until they became teenagers , anyway . Ina was twelve or thirteen when I met her , and already seriously built ; I think she scared him a lot worse than I did . " <p> Saturday was a typical London spring day , bleak and damp and gray  --  though Alice warned me that we 'd have to come home if the sun appeared ; it would n't kill her quickly , but a few hours worth would hurt and could crack her skin . Driving down Gower Street , she glanced through the window at a bag lady , and sat up . " You know her ? " I asked . <p> " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , but she does n't know it . She does n't even know she 's dead , she ca n't remember being alive , she does n't even know why the sun hurts her ; she just does her best to hide from it . She 's probably been living on cats , rats , all sorts of garbage . " <p> We turned into New Oxford Street , and I asked her to keep an eye out for a parking spot . " You said , last night , that you drank blood . Need it be human blood ? " <p> She shook her head . " It has to be human , but it does n't really have to be blood ; sperm will do , but we need much more of it than one man can make . Hundred years ago , some of the sidhe could fuck or suck enough men a night to stay alive that way , but not now . It takes too long , and it 's not worth the effort unless all the men come to you . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never trust the boys who do n't ask you to use a condom , some things are a lot worse than AIDS - but even they need blood sometimes . I do n't know why . None of us are scientists . But it has to be human , too , or you start losing your mind . Or your soul , maybe . You lose you , anyhow ; you become stupid , you start thinking like an animal , hunting animals , and then you die . Anna said that 's how the stories about vampires turning into wolves and rats began  --  that , and the way we used to catch rabies from them , and them from us . There 's one . " <p> I jumped , then realized she meant a parking spot , not a vampire . " Thanks . " <p> The weekend passed much too quickly , and on Monday morning I returned reluctantly to Chambers and the negative nineties . The Hatter and I were dissecting a lease and trying to bore a large hole in the boilerplate when the phone rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I agreed , and hung up , and enjoyed the feeling of relief for nearly a minute before I realized that Sullivan and I had n't made an appointment for lunch , and that he would simply have told his secretary to phone my secretary if we had . I asked the Hatter to excuse me , and slipped out of the room . Barbara was sitting at her desk , staring intently at the screenpeace as it created mazes and blundered through them . " I just spoke to Sullivan , " I said , softly . <p> " Yes , I know . " <p> " We were n't having lunch today , were we ? " <p> " Not that I heard . " <p> " What 's happened ? Is he sick ? " He had sounded a little strange  --  almost emotional . <p> " I do n't think so , " she said carefully . " I think it 's his wife  --  and I think you 'd better call him back .

He started gathering up the papers as soon as he saw my expression , and quickly disappeared . I slumped into my chair , and reached for the phone . <p> Sullivan told me the story with remarkable economy , for a politician ; Sylvia , his wife , had gone out on Saturday night , and not returned . He had n't reported her as missing ( the police wo n't act , or even listen very hard , until someone 's been gone forty-eight hours ) , and wanted the whole affair kept as quiet as possible .

If I 'd said no , it probably would n't have cost me anything more than my job , maybe not even that . " I 'll be there , " I replied . " If necessary , that is . I 'm sure she 'll turn up before it comes to that . " <p> He grunted . " Okay . Remember , if you get another offer , I 'll beat it ; that 's a promise . I 'll be in touch .

She was lying on the bed in the guest room , curled up into a fetal ball , still wearing her jeans and anorak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her face had relaxed into a pretty , girlish pout . I stood in the doorway watching her for a few minutes , and then crept into the kitchen . I enjoy cooking , when I have the time , and I often suspect I make the best chili in England .

How was your day ? " <p> " Pretty awful .

" I only saw most of them once or twice , " she said . " He usually lost interest in them when they turned eleven or twelve  --  I remember he was particularly nasty to Connie , as though it were her fault that she was growing up  --  but he was still calling Gertrude ' dear child ' when she was nearly thirty , and she let him , I guess she enjoyed it .

" Nowadays , parents can be arrested for photographing their own children naked , even in the bath . So much for progress . " <p> She looked at me coolly . " Have you ever read any Victorian porn ? A hell of a lot of it 's about old men fucking girls of ten or eleven , and that was n't just a fantasy ; it was common practice . There 's been some progress ; women and kids are better off , even if the men are n't . " <p> " Sorry . It was a stupid thing to say . " <p> " Yeah . It was . And okay , it 's a stupid law , but where do you draw the line ? " She shrugged . " You want to know if he fucked them , do n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't ask , it 's what they wonder . Do you want me to tell you ? " <p> I did n't answer . She sat there silently for nearly a minute , then , softly , " He did n't even want to . <p> " No , that 's a lie . Sometimes , he did want to  --  he dreamed about it , even fantasized about it , though he did whatever he could to distract himself from these fantasies  --  writing letters , inventing mathematical problems . . . . But I do n't think he ever touched any of them , especially not when they were naked , and I think that 's what matters . <p> " He never touched me , and I knew him for nearly forty years , and while I was physically as delicate and fragile and generally unsuitable for fucking as any of them , he knew I sure as shit was n't innocent . He never let me touch him , either ; and he hit me when I offered to fellate him . Knocked me across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and apologized later . The thought really horrified him . " <p> Which meant he 'd probably had it before , I thought , a man confronted with a new idea , however horrific , has to think about it for a moment before he can react . But I did n't say anything . <p> " He wanted to be the White Knight , courteous and gentle and dreamy , and clumsy , and bad at his job . . . and he never removed his armor . I think what he really wanted was for sex not to matter . He wanted to be a boy again  --  no , a child . Even being a boy implied that sex existed . " <p> " I am fond of children , ' " I quoted , " ' except boys . ' " <p> She nodded . " He grew up surrounded by sisters and younger brothers , until they sent him off to school , which he hated . He wanted to return home ; I think he spent the rest of his life wanting to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an adult ; he stuttered whenever he spoke to adults , he was n't even interested in money , let alone sex . He just liked studying , and solving mathematical problems , and writing little satires and nonsense , and surrounding himself with toys and books and children  --  all the things he 'd done as a child . He never ' put away childish things , ' as he once put it , and we loved him for it . Without him , I would n't have had a childhood at all . " <p> I looked down at the skillet , and realized that I was burning my dinner . I rescued it as best I could , and asked , " Why did n't you make him a vampire ? " <p> " I do n't know how  --  Anna never taught me  --  and , anyway , he would n't have wanted it .

" What 's happening in Piccadilly ? " <p> " You would n't like it . " <p> " I was n't expecting an invitation . Meeting more sidhe ?

" <p> That night , I dreamed about my childhood  --  something I had n't done in years . It was my tenth birthday , and everyone was there ; it was n't until I 'd woken up , still feeling good , that I began wondering what was wrong with that . I 'd had a tenth birthday party , yes , and I had gotten my first real camera then , and my parents were still together and all my grandparents were still alive , so what was  --  <p> Alice was in the en-suite , brushing her teeth . I 'd stopped wondering how she was getting in and out ; she 'd had more than a century to study burglary . " Is that what you meant when you said you give your victims dreams ?

I 'm a vampire . There is such a thing as professional courtesy . " <p> " I 'm serious . " <p> She shrugged , stuck the toothbrush back in her mouth , and glanced at the mirror ; I could see my reflection , but not hers . Eventually , she said , " I did n't give you that dream , you dreamed it by yourself . I just helped you remember it . What 's wrong ? " <p> " Nothing . " <p> " Bullshit . Nightmare ? " <p> " No . " <p> She smiled at the mirror . " Okay . So I screwed up . Sorry ; you looked happier than you had in years , and I thought . . . " <p> " Years ? " <p> " I remember when you were a student . You went to University College , right ? Rooms on Logic Lane ? " <p> I nodded . " Someone in admit must have had a twisted sense of humor . . .

And I remembered your face , the way you looked at me , and when I saw you again . . . " <p> " Did you bite me then ? When I was a student ? " <p> She looked away from me . " Not seriously .

Now if you 'd asked my advice , I 'd have said ' Leave off at seven '  --  but it 's too late now . " <p> " I never ask advice about growing , " Alice said indignantly . <p> " Too proud ? " the other enquired . <p> Alice felt even more indignant at that suggestion . " I mean , " she said , " that one ca n't help growing older .

She had n't . <p> A moment later , Barbara walked in without announcing herself . I put down the brief Midas had given me . " What 's wrong ? " <p> " You 're looking for Sylvia Sullivan ? " <p> I shrugged . As far as I knew , no one was . " Do you know where she is ? " <p> " No . . . " <p> " But ? " <p> She sat down , uncomfortably . " I 've seen her around the bars before . . .

I do n't think she was looking to get laid , but she probably would n't have said no if that was the asking price . She just wanted to be wanted ; failing that , she got drunk , and took a taxi home . Do you know the Elton John song ' All the Young Girls Love Alice ' ? From Goodbye Yellow Brick Road ?

London stared back at me , secure in her bulk , like a dinosaur that does n't realize that it 's being killed . " Could you go ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " Go to the clubs , or bars , or wherever . Take my card , and the Jag , and a photo , and ask if anyone 's seen her . If they have n't , you do n't even have to tell me where you went . " I turned away from the window , and almost managed to look Barbara in the eye . " I 'll pay you overtime , of course . " ' <p> She hesitated , then nodded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open this early ? " <p> " A few of them . . . " <p> I tossed her the car keys , and she backed out of the room . I looked over at the window again , at the thick gray clouds and the thin gray sunlight . All the young girls love  --  <p> Barbara returned at five , and I handed her a wad of taxi vouchers . I did n't need to ask whether she 'd had any joy . Getting lost in LondOn is easy  --  you do n't even have to try  --  and I had no good reason to believe that Sylvia was still in London . I 'd tried to persuade Sullivan to report her as missing , and he said he 'd think about it ( Jesus , I hate being lied to , even if it 's by a professional ) . At least he found her passport ; her credit cards were still missing , but they had n't been used since a visit to Harrods on Saturday morning , a fact that cheered him immensely . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been Sylvia Sullivan had been seen in a bar on Greek Street on Saturday night . She 'd talked to , danced with , and accepted drinks from at least three men and one woman , but the barman had n't noticed if she 'd left with any of them . " What do you think ? " <p> " I don " t know what to think . . . but it does n't sound as though she 'd arranged to meet any of them . " <p> I sipped at my coffee , forcing myself to wake up . " I agree . " <p> " What now ? The taxi drivers ? " <p> I shook my head . " The old man can only cover up for so long ; soon , someone 's bound to notice that she 's gone , and then it 'll be the cops ' baby . Or she might come back . " I probably did n't sound very convincing . <p> I was ten years old again , looking through a viewfinder and waiting for the flash to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and someone touched my neck and shoulder  --  <p> I lay there , wide-eyed in the darkness , feeling as though I were trapped in a bed that was smaller than I was . My feet seemed incredibly far away , and the ceiling much too close , and the red-lipped girl standing beside the bed was  --  <p> " You were dreaming again , " Alice said . " I thought I 'd better wake you . " <p> I sat up slowly , vaguely remembering that I was thirty-nine years old and six foot two . " Thanks . . . I think . What 's the time ? " <p> " About four . " <p> I peered at her blearily , and tried to focus ; my night vision is n't what it used to be ( but then again , it never was ) . " Where 've you been  --  no , forget I asked . Was it a nightmare ? " <p> " Do n't you remember ? " <p> " I  --  " I blinked , and suddenly felt very cold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , shook her head , and turned to walk out . " No . Please . " I rubbed my eyes . " Look , I wo n't be able to get back to sleep , now . Tell me more about Dodgson . " <p> She stopped , looked over her shoulder , said " No , " and continued walking . <p> " Why not ? " <p> " You 're lying to me . " <p> I sat there , numb , and watched her leave . Finally , I muttered ; " I 'm sorry . " <p> A moment later , she reappeared in the doorway . " Tell me a story , " she suggested . <p> " What ? " <p> " You 're obsessed with a children 's fantasist who 's been dead for nearly a hundred years  --  even more obsessed than you were when you were seventeen . Why ? " <p> " I liked his books a lot when I was a kid . My mother used to read them to me ; she still loved them , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oxford , everyone seemed more interested in Charles Dodgson the pedophile than Lewis Carroll the fantasist . . . and it pissed me off , hearing them turn someone who 'd written books that made so many kids happy into some sort of monster . I mean , there was n't any evidence , none of the kids or even the parents accused him , you know it was n't true . . . . I guess it became my first libel case , in a way . I did my damnedest to prove him innocent . . . " <p> Alice stared at me , darkly , and then nodded . It was nothing but the truth , though she must have guessed it was n't the whole truth . . . " Okay . " She walked back into the room , and sat on the foot of the bed . <p> " There 's a Dodgson story I do n't think anyone else knows , " she said , quietly . " A few people may have guessed  --  shit , I 'm guessing most of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Dodgson was always so nostalgic about his childhood that I do n't think anyone 's even wondered if he was abused as a boy . They do n't know , or they forget , how much he hated his school days at Rugby . Maybe they know that he impressed the teachers , but they do n't realize how much most of the boys hated him . They may have heard that he had a reputation for being able to defend himself , but they did n't hear him wishing that his school had given every boy a separate cubicle instead of putting all the beds in an open dorm . . . <p> " Maybe it was an older boy ; more likely , it was a lot of them , more than he could fight off . But I 'm only guessing . . . " <p> They found Sylvia Sullivan 's Gucci handbag in a trashcan near Canary Wharf that morning . It gave them the clue they needed to identify the body they 'd found between two of the half-empty office blocks on Sunday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the dental records had n't been enough . <p> No one knew how she 'd gotten up to the roof without setting off a dozen alarms . I had a sneaking suspicion , but I did n't think the coroner would believe me . <p> There are skeptical thoughts , which seem for the moment to uproot the firmest faith ; there are blasphemous thoughts , which dart unbidden into the most reverent souls ; there are unholy thoughts , which torture , with their hateful presence , the fancy that would fain be pure . <p>  --  Lewis Carroll , Pillow Problems I rushed home at lunchtime , and opened all the curtains in the house , except for the guest room . It was raining , of course , but I could n't wait for the sun to reappear . Alice was asleep , or dead , and her clothes were scattered over the floor . I searched her pockets , finding nothing , and suddenly she rolled over and looked up . <p> I opened my wallet , removed a photograph of Sylvia , and flipped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly . <p> " You do recognize her , " I growled . " I 'd hoped I was paranoid . Did you kill her ? " ' <p> " What makes you  --  " <p> " I saw photographs of the body . There was hardly any blood at all . The coroner 's trying to convince himself it was washed away by the rain . I 've been trying not to wonder where you 've been feeding , but now I have to know . Did you kill her ? " <p> She shrank back , then shook her head slowly . " Me ? No . She was already dead . " <p> " You found her in the alley ? " <p> " No . There was a feast on the roof . " She smiled bleakly . " I was the guest of honor  --  the new kid in town , so to speak . I did n't know she was a friend of yours .

Most of them chicken out . Sometimes they take her home , but she leaves before they find out what she is . Some of them . . . say yes . " <p> I managed to lift my head and look at her . " For Christ 's sake  --  " My voice cracked , and I tried again . " What sort of monster  --  " <p> " I 'm a vampire , " she replied . " You said so yourself . Or a sidhe . Or a boojum , maybe .

" <p> I rested my head on my hands , wearily . " Easy . How easy do you think it was for Dodgson ? Hating boys , but never hurting them , just shutting them out of his universe ? Loving little girls , but never touching them apart from the occasional kiss ?

" <p> " When you dream , you call out for ' Irene . ' You did when you were at Oxford , too . Who is she ? " <p> I looked at her . My eyes hurt like hell from crying , something I had n't done in nearly thirty years , and all I could see was the dark hair and darker eyes . I knew it was n't Irene , but it might have been . . . <p> " Irene . . . " I began . " Irene was the first . The first girl I. . . . She . . . . <p> " She , uh , lived two houses away , when I was a kid . Year older than me . Beautiful girl , really beautiful . . . her mother died when she was , I do n't know , seven or eight I guess , and she lived alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't remember . Does n't matter . " <p> I took a deep breath , and tried to start again . " She was the best friend I had and the only one who lived nearby . Her father would n't let anyone visit the house , but she used to sneak over to mine before he came home in the evening . Mostly , she liked to borrow books  --  he would n't buy any , or give her any money  --  or just sit on my bed and read . <p> " When I turned ten  --  she was eleven and a half  --  I had a birthday party , and invited her , but her father would n't let her go . We kept hoping that he 'd change his mind , or come home late , or whatever , so she was sort of guest of honor . . . but she did n't turn up . Jesus , I 'd forgotten that party , until  --  anyway , my parents were splitting up , though I did n't know it then , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He gave me a camera  --  a good one , a Nikon , with a zoom lens and flash . . . I 'd used his camera before , I was better with it than he ever was . . . <p> " Irene came over the next afternoon . The rain was passing down , I remember that . . . she was saying how sorry she was that she had n't come to the party , and she had n't been able to buy me a present . I showed her the camera , and she asked if I 'd like to take some photographs of her . I took a few close-ups of her face , and then she started unbuttoning her blouse . She said it was okay , her father took photographs of her , like that , all the time . . . <p> " I can still remember what she looked like : dark hair , like yours , big dark eyes , she was a little taller than me , but skinny , very small breasts , little pink nipples . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we . . . " I tried to talk , but there was a lump in my throat that I just could n't swallow . Finally , I whispered , " did some of the other things she and her father did all the time . . . <p> " It was nineteen sixty-six , I was ten , sex education was . . . well , my parents had n't told me anything , and my teachers sure as shit had n't . Besides , she kept saying it was okay , and I . . . I really liked her . " <p> " Did your parents catch you ? " <p> " No ; I wish to hell they had . My father was n't home yet , and my mother . . . I do n't know . Irene dressed herself , and ran back home before her father got there . Of course , he knew what had happened , and when she told him that I 'd taken photographs . . . <p> " He had a gun  --  it was supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom and shot himself in the head . But not before he shot her . <p> " I do n't think we heard anything ; if we did , we probably thought it was thunder . The rest of the story did n't come out for another few days . When it did . . . <p> " When it did , my mother took my camera , and ripped the film out , and burnt it . I do n't remember what she did to me . " <p> I took a deep breath , and threw up all over the bed . <p> Alice was waiting as I emerged from the shower . She 'd closed the curtains , and the darkness was almost comforting , like a confessional . I suspect I still looked like hell , but at least I felt human . Almost . I tied a robe around myself , and collapsed onto the couch . " You said she was the first , " said Alice . <p> " Yeah . Well . I did n't have sex with anyone else until I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .

I 'd been told it was London 's answer to the Zone , or Times Square , but I could hardly find a picture of a naked girl who was n't being spanked , caned , or whipped . It was like the London Dungeon  --  you know , the horror museum for kids  --  where it 's okay to look at nudes , as long as they 're being executed or tortured . Christ . Besides , most of the models looked old enough to be my mother . <p> " After that , it . . . became better . Easier . I met a few girls at Oxford who were still in their late teens . . . blondes were best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Irene , I did n't have to worry about using the wrong name , and eventually I got used to them , but it was never as good as . . .

There was a child brothel that a client of ours knew about , out in the back streets , they had girls as young as seven . I picked one who looked about eleven ; I do n't know how old she really was . " I shook my head . " I could n't go through with it , and finally she gave up and I paid her and she said ' mai pen rai , ' never mind . I 've sent thousands of pounds to Thailand since then , sponsoring kids , but it has n't made me feel any better . <p> " And I bought some kiddie porn , once , by accident . Honest .

" she repeated . <p> I thought about that , and finally replied , " Nothing I can have . I want Irene to have survived . Even you ca n't do that . " <p> " No , " she said . " I ca n't . Is there anything else you want ? " <p> I stared into the darkness . I could barely see Alice , just a pair of eyes and a hint of sharp teeth . " Innocence . If not mine , then . . .
