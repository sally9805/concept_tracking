txt // fleet . The effect of steam and the telegraph was to create a taut sensory network that allowed Britain to disperse its navy over a vast expanse yet respond to local crises in a timely way . When the fleet was needed at any particular trouble spot , it could steam there quickly and reliably . Dispersed ships could be based forward , distant from the mother country , and ordered by telegraph to mass for local superiority . Thus could a tiny force control a vast area . The key geopolitical structure here was the network . Network timetables that listed what the British navy could reach , with how many ships , in a given amount of time , became the key to controlling Britain 's vast empire . Before the telegraph and the steamship , such timetables were impossible . Britain had no monopoly on these technologies . Together with another revolutionary technology , radio , these developments , were to reorganize East Asian geography once again . Early in the twentieth century Japan began a major program of constructing warships . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international arms control agreement , the Washington Naval Agreement . The agreement was not very successful , in part because it failed to take into account the development of the aircraft carrier and the way in which Japan would integrate its land and naval forces . The aircraft carrier allowed a country to move its airpower forward without land bases . More than anything else , it allowed surprise . The aircraft carrier allowed the air base to appear suddenly , seemingly out of nowhere , as the success of the Japanese at Pearl Harbor demonstrated . Five Japanese aircraft carriers sailed north of the usual Pacific sea lanes , staying out of sight and operating under radio silence to avoid detection . They turned south for the attack , catching the unwary American defenders in Hawaii by surprise . The role of the integration of the Japanese navy and army in transforming Asian military space is much less appreciated . Many historical accounts describe die feuding and bureaucratic warfare // between the two services . But there was enough integration to allow Japan to overrun East Asia in a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a map , Tokyo looks to be 3,000 miles from Singapore . But the distances separating the intervening islands and coastal ports in China and Vietnam were small . The Japanese navy had to haul the army only relatively short distances to leapfrog all the way to Singapore , where the British were completely routed . No military force in history had put sea and land forces to such a use , and the effect on the British and Americans was devastating . For the United States , Pearl Harbor revolutionized its concept of Asian geography , literally overnight . While there were many before 1941 who saw the need to protect American interests by having a military that could shape events in East Asia , it was not until Pearl Harbor that this need finally sunk into public consciousness . The effect was to alter every aspect of American national strategy . Most tellingly , the vocabulary of defense changed overnight . Before World War II , hemispheric defense had been the overarching military framework of the Republic since its founding . After Pearl Harbor , a new term , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much broader range of possible threats than direct attacks on the American territory itself . The new term recognized that dangers to allies , or even a buildup of hostile military power in distant parts of the world , could affect the United States in profound ways . It was an expanded spatial conception of defense that has endured to the present time . ASIA IN THE COLD WAR The cold war had its own geography . For the United States after World War 11 , Asia was not some outer region beyond Europe . ( ' hr very term Asia was itself too big to fit into the spatial requirements of the cold war , which had to do with containment , not col22 FIRE IN THE EAST onization . The new map of Asia was built on subregions of the Asian rim , acknowledging that inner Asia was necessarily controlled by the adversary . This view was given reality by government and foundation support for " regional studies " at universities . Academic programs flourished around the culture , society , and politics of regions relevant for cold war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West ; in its place arose the Middle East , South Asia , Southeast Asia , and Northeast Asia . For example , before the 1940s Thailand , British Malaya , and French Indo-China were distinct entities , but grouping them under the heading of " Southeast Asia " conveniently wiped out their colonial heritage , removing a memory that worked against cold war containment policies and replacing it with a neutral designation that suggested common interests and fates . This designation presaged the " domino theory , " which held that if one country in Southeast Asia fell to communism , so would all of the others , as one domino in a chain knocks down the others . Likewise , the Middle East , a term originally coined by the American naval strategist Alfred Mahan in 1902 to describe the lands surrounding the Persian Gulf , also received a new geographic unity in the cold war . The Eisenhower Doctrine of the 1950s stated that the United States would not allow a country in this area to go Communist . Geographic designation drove strategic declarations . This was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . It may have started out that way in the 1940s , but it was surprising how soon the new geographic designations shaped the military dynamics of the cold war , the movement of forces , the location of bases , and the thresholds for military action . This geographic regionalization even affected American nuclear war plans . This is one of the most neglected fields of ' international politics : the way in which geographic designations create political hound ; tries that , if rrosscd , ran lead to international tensions , even war . // In the cold war crucial subregions were given military command structures to ensure their defense . For Europe , the western appendage to Asia , there was the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) . In the 1950s NATO was cloned and applied to the Middle East ( the Central Treaty Organization , or CENTO ) and Southeast Asia ( Southeast Asia Treaty Organization , or SEATO ) . In Northeast Asia separate treaties linked the United States with Japan and with South Korea , two countries whose history of animosity earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pact . Cold war escalation was shaped by this geography . Escalation confined within a subregion was one thing , but its potential spread to other regions was considered very serious . Such " compound " or " horizontal " escalation played on the fundamental weakness of the United States , which faced the much larger land armies of the Soviet Union at least as old as Hannibal . This situation was recognized as a critical threshold for the transition to nuclear war , and it was the reason the United States built tens of thousands of tactical nuclear weapons . If Moscow had simultaneously attacked Western Europe and the Middle East , it was almost certain that nuclear weapons would have been fired at the advancing Soviet armies . American war plans called for waging a conventional defense in any one subregion . But if escalation spread to other subregions , nuclear war was almost ensured . Given that Europe was the most important of the cold war subregions , this rule implied early nuclear strikes against Communist attacks in Asia . Otherwise , the army in Europe would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like the British earlier in the century , the United States built a geopolitical structure that was much more than a collection of military units and bases . It was a sensory network with rules and inter24 FIRE IN THE EAST relationships among its parts , extending even to nuclear forces . Understanding how new military technologies give rise to geopolitical structures such as NATO is critical to understanding the slow changes that concern us here . THE CREATION OF THE PACIFIC BASIN Over a hundred-year period the concept of Asia had been created by Western maritime power , and then deconstructed by the cold war . Asian space again changed in the 1970s as a general economic boom spread over Asia 's rimland nations . Thus began a trend back to a larger geographic entity , the Pacific Basin . The regional mindset imposed by the cold war overlooked this critical development . High rates of growth first appeared in Japan , and then in South Korea . In the 1980s the economic boom spread to Thailand , Malaysia , Indonesia , Singapore , and eventually China . U.S. trans-Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herman Kahn of the Hudson Institute argued that the Pacific Ocean was becoming a great connector , rather than a great divider , of nations . The common thread of economic growth among nations that had little else in common gave rise to this new geopolitical structure , the Pacific Basin . It stood for economic dynamism , market capitalism , and a national emphasis on business . Over time the Pacific Basin has grown to include more and more states ; in the 1990s a new term , the Asia-Pacific Region , extended the concept to India.29 The Pacific Basin is a zone where , in theory , threats of force are unthinkable . Military threats would only undermine the region 's claim to unity , its economic dynamism . A geography of finance and commerce has no place in it for war . // There is one notable exception . One great power must protect this fabulous success story . Nothing must be allowed to reverse this great transformation , neither local conflicts that get out of control nor an emerging power trying to set things on a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Pacific Basin is the ideal military geography for the United States because it assumes a compliant acceptance of American military dominance in Asia . Those who contest this , like Iraq , are isolated by the United States and its Asian allies . This , at least , has been the theory in the 1990s . Thus continues a centuries-long tradition of the greatest military power in Asia not being Asian at all . How long can this tradition last ? LEARNING FROM GENGHIS Asia stretches military forces . The great distances and the varied topography challenge military organizations to overcome both . The greatest military power in Asia , the United States , is automatically affected by this challenge . As Asia stretches its military , those forces spill out into spaces that once were solely utilized by the American military . As missile ranges increase , as navies move farther from shore , and as military satellites track targets , increased interaction and friction are inevitable and unavoidable if both parties occupy the same space . Asia 's tendency to stretch military forces is not new . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Persia , and penetrated to the heart of Europe . Theirs was the largest land empire in history , put together in only a few decades of the thirteenth century . It was based on horsemen using speed and stealth to outflank opponents , fighting in self-contained formations but directed by the ( treat Khan . It is said that daily situation reports were sent hack to his court in Mongolia three thousand miles away , and that // even at this distance he had a better picture of local conditions than did his opponents . To wage war in Asia requires forces that can be effective over its vast distances . Traditional European armies have proved useless in Asia ; their place has been usurped by maritime forces built around navies and light infantry . The United States defeated Japan in World War II with a new combat organization consisting of amphibious forces , submarines , and aircraft carriers . The tanks and heavily mechanized units that were used in Europe played only a small role in the Pacific . Three-fourths of the U.S. army 's eighty-nine World War II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brunt of the fight against Japan . The pattern begun by the Mongols and the European seapowers prevails today . Outside powers disperse their forces in Asia , relying on communications and mobility to mass them as needed . The U.S. military presence in Asia is mostly on and under the water , spread relatively thinly across 12,000 miles , with bases in the Middle East , Diego Garcia , Guam , South Korea , Japan , Hawaii , and Alaska . In NATO Europe , in contrast , American forces have been much heavier and more compact . Asia 's immense size has other consequences . For most of history alliances never mattered much in Asia . It was all but impossible to rely on allies for support . Distances and terrain made it impractical to send military assistance in time to make any difference . This is why there was never a NATO in Asia , or a Warsaw Pact , and why even the NATO clones such as CENTO and SEATO never worked there . They could not overcome the long historical tradition of nations fending for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Mongols , many Asian countries are now expanding the reach of their armed forces . They are building missiles and weapons of mass destruction , not infantry forces . China , for example , has been gradually moving firers outward toward the Spratly islands it- the South ( : hina Sea , // using naval patrols and marine deployments to attain virtual sovereignty there . The Spratly Islands , 800 miles southeast of China , are usually looked at for their potential to hold undersea oil deposits . They are disputed territory claimed by Vietnam and the Philippines as well as China . Whether there is in fact oil on the seabed around them is something only time will tell . But looked at more broadly , an interesting pattern is revealed . In its effort to secure the islands , the Chinese navy is stretching its abilities to operate far from the Chinese coast . Air combat missions are coordinated with the surface fleet . Refueling at sea is practiced . Weather satellites are tied into fleet operations . Communications and intelligence , to warn of U.S. Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with respect to oil , the more enduring consequence of the Spratly Islands dispute will be to increase Chinese know-how in projecting force over long distances . A fleet that can be sent to the southeast can also be sent to the northeast . A navy that can operate 1,000 miles from home is one that can be stretched to operate even farther from shore . In the past only outside Western powers had sensory networks in Asia , communications grids using satellites and underwater listening devices to find out what was going on . Now China , India , and Israel are all beginning to build such networks , which , although primitive compared to U.S. communications , mark a profound technological turning point . Japan recently announced that it is launching four intelligence satellites of its own , to more carefully watch events in East Asia without the filter provided for the intelligence it shares with the United States . China in particular is getting better communications , with its far-flung military deployed on borders with Vietnam , India , Kazakhstan , and Russia , as well as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station in the Indian Ocean to watch the Indian navy . All of these dispersed units must be coordinated and linked to centralized military headquarters . Indian armed forces are also being stretched . Indian military // geography for centuries was shaped by invaders coming across the northwest frontier and advancing into the richest part of the country . The Himalayas secured the northeastern frontier from Chinese attack . But in the northwest the large Punjab plain invited attack by land armies . This plain is in the western part of a large horseshoe-shaped agricultural belt extending from Calcutta all the way to Karachi . The area is so flat that from Calcutta to Lahore , a distance of 1,300 miles , the elevation changes by only 1,000 feet . As has happened time after time in India , cavalry forces coming from the Khyber Pass or other portals can travel by way of Delhi to the Bengali capital of Calcutta without meeting a single natural barrier . A network of forts has been in place since time immemorial to block this traditional gateway , beginning with Peshawar and Rawalpindi ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was nothing for an Indian navy to do , and it was always deemphasized in favor of the army . The northwest still presents a vulnerable invasion corridor , and Delhi has focused on Pakistan since both states were created in 1947 . Now , however , an entirely new geographic expansion is stretching the Indian military to greater distances , and in new directions . India now watches China , once a country largely irrelevant to its security because the two were separated by the highest mountains in the world . Until the early 1990s India relied on Moscow for satellite pictures of Chinese troop dispositions in Tibet . These came in every few months and put India at the mercy of Soviet intelligence . But now Indian satellites and reconnaissance aircraft provide this information directly . The changing focus of the Indian navy pulls the nation 's military in yet another direction , to the east . The navy has traditionally had three command centers , all on the mainland . Recently a new Far Eastern Naval Command has been set up in the Andaman Islands , 750 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval presence // in the area . To keep track of the Chinese forces , India has installed extensive surveillance and intelligence monitoring , stretching its forces in the opposite direction from their traditional focus on Pakistan and placing enormous new demands on the Indian navy to communicate and coordinate in an area where only a few years ago the Indians were , for all practical purposes , blind . It is highly likely that this dispersal will require Delhi to reshape its military command and control system , just as Beijing has done . Organizational stretch drives the strategy of many Asian nations as they seek to monitor potential trouble spots beyond their national borders and to develop the ability to reach those places with military force . This factor has mostly been overlooked , however , in the West , where analysts tend to view strategy in terms of a grand long-range political plan to spread influence . Speeches of national leaders are carefully examined for clues about their future intentions . But it is the larger structural change that better explains why Asian countries are rushing to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern for security is forcing countries from Israel to North Korea to confront and overcome geographic obstacles , especially distance . The Indian navy is covering the eastern Indian Ocean , where ten years ago only the Americans could operate . China is building a communications link to its armies in the far west , and to its forces in the South China Sea . Israel uses satellites to watch Iraq , Iran , and Pakistan . // THE COMING CRISIS OF " ROOM " ON THE EURASIAN CHESSBOARD The Pacific Basin constitutes a geography of one superpower and many subordinate states voluntarily concentrating on economic , not military , development . But it is falling apart as Asian industrial power becomes aligned with Asian military power . The United States has not recognized the significance of this development but has tried to preserve the geopolitical structure of the past fifty years , decoupling Asian industrial capacity from military force . Washington sees its interest in Asia as preventing the rise of any power or group of powers that could challenge its leadership . Its rhetoric is meant to suggest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a basic order , the Pacific Basin , that has brought prosperity to all who have chosen to participate in it . In concrete terms , this policy translates into holding on to bases , stopping the spread of missiles and weapons of mass destruction , isolating renegades , and managing pivotal states like China . But to play this game on the Eurasian chessboard is to fail to appreciate how much has changed since the end of the cold war . The power of many of the pieces is rapidly growing through the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction . The chessboard is shrinking as pawns take on the range of knights and bishops . Previously unrelated parts of the board are now highly linked , making it hard for a power whose forces are dispersed over an enormous area to achieve local advantage . For example , the United States nearly always looks at China as an East Asian country . But China 's supply of missile parts to Iran greatly increases the pressure on U.S. forces in the Middle East . Whether China consciously intends to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iran worsens die U.S. strategic position in Asia . Building up defenses against Iran takes resources away from Fast Asia , unless the overall U.S. defense effort is increased . In short , // playing the game without recognizing that the chessboard has changed can only lead to disaster . This does not mean that the United States should withdraw from the game . To retreat from Asia ? or to disarm to the level of France or Britain , with forces adequate only for short-distance peacekeeping ? would invite arms buildups throughout the continent . Countries would feel threatened , and this military pressure would force some in the Middle East , like Saudi Arabia , to succumb to blackmail from Iran or Iraq . South Korea and Japan would very likely go nuclear . Pakistan would be in an even more desperate and trigger-happy condition than it already is . And Iraq , Iran , and Syria would combine their missile power against Israel . The challenge for the United States is to play the game on a new chessboard . Indeed , recognizing that the game is taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techniques of power ? fixed bases , arms control , and " managing " China ? have played out their usefulness . They can be kept for a while , but they can not be the foundation for future American military presence in Asia . The value of fixed bases is certain to decline . No new arms control regime for weapons of mass destruction is likely to be anywhere near as successful as the one now ending . And there is no new China policy waiting to be discovered that will move China onto the track that Americans would ideally like to see that country take . The shrinking Eurasian chessboard also creates a structural crisis not seen before . Simply stated , Asia is running out of room : room for political and military maneuvering ; room to buffer relations between armed powers ; and room to insulate domestic crises from spilling over into the international system . This is a critical point : the crisis of room has major implications for how military forces are structured and operated , and for how basic strategies and agreements are formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two countries to enlarge // their military without any undue danger . In the nineteenth century Britain and Russia met in Afghanistan and Central Asia in what was called " the Great Game . " In the twentieth century the United States confronted the Soviet Union . In both cold wars each side acted as if such confrontation were the axial event in its foreign policy . Meticulous plans were built for the clashes between giants . Britain had plans for using 100,000 camels to supply a war against Russia in Afghanistan from India . The United States had plans for using tens of thousands of nuclear bombs . Neither plan was ever executed . The parties did n't want a war so incredibly expensive and destructive . Both sets of antagonists learned to live and let live , with informal agreements that clearly spelled out how far each could go . It is useful to keep this in mind when a forecast is made of a coming war between China and the United States . The basis of this pessimistic forecast is a clash for domination of Asia . China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States that the Soviet Union did . A major military confrontation with Washington would be highly upsetting to Beijing 's economic and other interests . But more important , concentrating on a fundamental clash of interests between two powers misses the more important structural transformation in Asia , the expansion of military reach in an area whose stability used to depend precisely on the inability of countries to attack each other 's heartlands . Technology 's relationship to geography is shrinking everyone 's maneuvering room , political and military . Tensions increase as once-isolated domestic pressures spill across national borders . The spread of the bomb is unfortunate . But it is tolerable if it is confined to one or two countries , and if they do not use it for anything more than symbolic purposes . When eight or nine contiguous countries get the bomb or missile-mounted weapons of mass // destruction , the situation changes . The chessboard shrinks , just as it shrank in Europe at the beginning of the nineteenth century . Diplomats then failed to appreciate that industrialization , applied to war , had eliminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far worse than anyone had imagined . Yet diplomats blithely went along as before , playing the old game on a radically constricted chessboard . A crisis of room is a possibility that was noted many years ago by the great Hungarian-American mathematician John von Neumann . Von Neumann was undoubtedly one of the greatest minds of the twentieth century . He invented the mathematical theory of games and helped design the hydrogen bomb . His design for memory storage devices was a breakthrough in early computing . Writing in 1954 for Fortune magazine , von Neumann argued that the space in which technological progress took place was becoming undersized and underorganized , not as a result of bad policies but as an inherent consequence of technology 's relationship to geography . Von Neumann 's contention was that geographical and political space provided a kind of safety mechanism for technological advance . Asia 's agricultural society has had just this dampening effect on social shocks and political dislocations . The Great Leap Forward , monsoon disasters , and even the Vietnam War had little effect on the outside world . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia 's impact on the world was not that great . The problem identified by von Neumann in 1954 was that political space was being outrun by the expanding influence of industrialization and military technology . This is an easy change to miss because it is gradual , and because of the way most people look at weapons . New weapons are usually seen as mere incremental improvements over earlier ones , or as changes in the military balance , the bean count of who has what . The effect of new weapons on the structure of international politics is easily overlooked . The // Gulf War showed this clearly . Before 1991 no one imagined that a country on the outer fringes of Israel 's security space would attack it with missiles . In earlier Middle Eastern conflicts , in 1967 and 1973 , Iraq had sent only a token ground force against Israel . But in 1991 Israel was struck directly by this fringe country . Suddenly the fate of the Gulf region became inextricably bound up with events in the Mediterranean . Had Iraq had a few more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survival of Israel would have been at risk . Von Neumann worried that the finite size of the earth would itself be a factor in increasing instability as more nations industrialized and expanded the geographic scale of their armed forces . In a cold war world with two superpowers , all kinds of agreements ? including informal understandings about the geographic thresholds for nuclear escalation and self-imposed limits on new weapons ? worked as well as they did because cold war geography provided maneuver room . Moscow backed down in Cuba , but heated up an insurgency in Vietnam . In this way , the superpower confrontation was shifted about from one place to another , all within self-imposed constraints on how far any one crisis could be pushed . The United States and the Soviet Union were only a few miles apart across the Bering Strait , but almost all of their confrontations took place in spaces with plenty of room . But this is not the case when it comes to North and South Korea , Pakistan , India , Israel , Iran , China , or Taiwan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buffer room they once had . Immediate dangers and opportunities on their borders are close enough to present real problems and are within the grasp of politicians needing an issue to mobilize supporters . When Iran fired a missile with the range to hit Israel , it did more than test a weapon . It shrank the Middle Eastern corner of the Asian chessboard even more than in 1991 and brought two very different political systems into // proximate contact . Reducing the psychological distance between the two changed Middle Eastern politics forever . The crisis of room on the Eurasian chessboard fundamentally changes the game for the United States . U.S. strategy since the cold war has focused on conventional regional war . The geographic size of this war can even be specified because it comes from the Gulf War and the Korean theater . A box with 200-mile sides nicely covers both of these regions . A 40,000-square-mile box defines the limits of current strategic thinking as well . Within it , the United States prepares for a conventional war in which nuclear , chemical , and biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays to American strengths . No nation could stand up to the United States in such a war . So it is natural that the United States should do whatever it takes to shape the strategic environment this way . If conflict can be kept conventional and confined to this box , if people can be made to think of war and deterrence in only these terms , the psychological advantage to the United States is tremendous . Arms control , technology embargoes , and diplomatic pressures to limit the acquisition of new weapons all make perfect sense . But what is taking place is something quite different . By changing the geographic scale of their armed forces to operate in a bigger box , or boxes , and by diversifying from conventional to weapons of mass destruction , Asian nations ? especially China , India , Iran , Iraq , Pakistan , and North Korea ? are overcoming the U.S. psychological and military advantage . Much like a business going into new geographic and product areas , Asia is expanding its military scale to larger areas and diversifying into nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new check on the United States . In the cold war it was constrained by the fear of escalation . That was the check // against launching air strikes against Soviet missiles in Cuba . It was an even more powerful impediment in Vietnam , where the fear of Chinese intervention made leaders in four administrations conduct that war with a level of restraint that virtually guaranteed failure . Since the end of the cold war no such fear of escalation has been present to put such restraints on the United States , with the unfortunate effect of divorcing political from military strategy . The Gulf War was turned over to military commanders in a way not seen since the Spanish-American War . This ca n't continue in the future . The prospect that China or Iran or any one of a number of others could accurately target either the United States or its bases in Japan or Saudi Arabia must result in a full-scale reassessment of the American military posture in Asia . The problem facing the United States is not one that can be solved by reproducing better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach of the last few years , but as we see in the next chapter , it is one that does not come to grips with the different nature of these new technologies . // The country with the best technology does not always win , either in battle or in the struggle to impose a world order . North Vietnam fought with primitive technology and beat the United States . France had more and better tanks than Nazi Germany but was overrun in a matter of weeks . Britain had the finest naval technology in the world early in the century . Nonetheless , its empire fell . The point can be made more strongly . Putting faith in a technology lead is often a fatal distraction , not , as one would expect , because morale and strategy are more important than technology . Nor is it that Western military technology has become too complex to use . The danger lies in the failure to distinguish between technologies that help sustain leadership and those that undermine it by disrupting the status quo . This distinction is basic in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s not by selling better computers but by competing with a different technology , software , thus upsetting the market in which IBM 's know-how had been dominant . Microsoft had a better software than IBM and pushed this advantage to the limit . Customers sought out the better software because u enabled them to do what they wanted on their // PCs , and pretty soon it was the software rather than the computer that developed into a brand name . IBM continued to sell good computers , but its competence in that area was rendered irrelevant by Microsoft 's software ; soon the PC became a commodity . Disruptive technology changes the game . By upsetting existing advantages , it nurtures new skills and fosters different strategies . The resulting uncertainty shakes up the established order and changes the standards by which leadership is measured . Leaders whose dominance is threatened often do not recognize major environmental changes until it is too late . Using old standards , they assess their situation and conclude that they are safely ahead . But that advantage is measured by the standards that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick with an outmoded paradigm . The ballistic missiles and atomic , chemical , and biological weapons coming to Asia are all disruptive technologies . They nullify Western advantages in conventional weapons . They restrict Western military access to Asia . They foster new talents ? for example , brinkmanship using weapons of mass destruction ? that undermine the West 's conventional superiority . In short , they trump the Western technological lead . The West can keep its technical lead over Asia . Its cruise missiles can strike with pinpoint accuracy . The West can have better tanks , bombs , and airplanes , measured in any head-to-head comparison . But disruptive technologies diminish the importance of these comparisons because they shift competition to areas where geographic and political factors work against the West . THE DAWN OF POSTMODERN WARFARE Biological weapons are a good example of a disruptive technology . They have a radically different profile from traditional conventional weapons , and this makes them hard to categorize in Western // strategic thinking . Iraq 's program is a case in point . The program was cut short by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this accident of timing , Iraq would have succeeded in building a germ weapon arsenal that could have attacked U.S. bases in the Middle East , rendering them unable to launch the kind of strike that decided the Gulf War . Iraq also could have killed a significant part of the population of Israel . Iraq 's program started in 1974 , two years after it joined one hundred other countries in signing the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention , a treaty that had no inspection , verification , or enforcement mechanisms . Throughout the 1970s , and during its war with Iran in the 1980s , Iraq undertook a very wide research program to find germ agents with field utility . Anthrax ( a cattle and sheep disease that is fatal 90 percent of the time when transmitted to unprotected humans ) , aflatoxin ( causing liver cancer ) , botulinum toxin ( causing muscle paralysis ) , tricothecene mycotoxins ( which induce high-speed projectile vomiting and nausea ) , wheat cover smut ( an anti-crop agent to starve an enemy ) , and rotovirus ( causing acute diarrhea ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraqi germ laboratories . The stand-out agent here must be aflatoxin because it takes such a long time for the cancer to develop . The logic was that if the West attacked Iraq , it would retaliate so that even young people would get cancer years later in their middle age . Just before the Gulf War , Iraq started a crash effort to turn this research program into weapons that could be used to wipe out Israel . It is important to recognize that the program was mainly designed to kill unprotected soldiers and civilians in the rear , not frontline combat troops . In doing this , Iraq contemplated a different kind of war . MIG jets were retrofitted to fly by remote control , without pilots aboard . They were equipped with sprayers to drizzle anthrax over Israeli cities from 250-gallon storage tanks . Although such attacks were never conducted , one of ' the jets was actually test-flown. // After inspection by the United Nations , Iraq admitted to building 157 germ bombs for delivery from aircraft , by artillery and short-range rockets , and by pesticide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missiles , modified SCUDs , of the kind that were fired at Israel and Saudi Arabia with conventional explosives . Of these 25 missiles , 16 used botulinum toxin , 5 used anthrax , and 4 used aflatoxin . These weapons were actually sent to the field at the start of the Gulf War , where they were prepared for firing on short notice . Amazingly , predelegated launch orders were given to the military commanders by Saddam Hussein . This meant that had certain conditions been met ? an allied ground attack to end Saddam 's regime ? the commanders would have fired their germfilled SCUDs at Israel without further orders . Iraq 's actual biowar stockpile was larger than its admission to UN inspectors . Imports of forty tons of germ growth stock suggest that the arsenal could have amounted to the high hundreds , or even into the thousands , of bombs . Had the Gulf War not intervened , Israel could have found itself by 1996 facing 500 SCUDs with biological warheads on them . This estimate of the Iraqi effort is not exaggerated . Baghdad bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iran . In one six-week period in 1988 it fired 189 rockets at Iran 's cities . Disappointingly , from Iraq 's point of view , only about 2,500 people were killed . The lesson Iraq drew was that a deadlier warhead was needed ; along with parallel programs in nuclear and chemical weapons , the development of biological weapons was pushed to meet this need for greater killing power . The West treats biological warfare as a problem of nonproliferation . The Iraqi program is discussed in the language of arms control , of inspections and verifications . Much effort is applied to arcane problems such as " dual use , " the confusion arising from the fact that the same equipment that makes germ weapons can also be used to Drew beer . Sanctions are imposed ; tIN special conunissions are estabDISRUPTIVE // lished ; restrictions are placed on the sale of biotechnology . The significance of biological weapons is not that they are " difficult " from the standpoint of arms control . Rather , their significance lies in the way they break the grip of established military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with biological weapons than in a world without them . They open new paths of military evolution , just as the steamship and the tank once did . But they are much easier to build . Countries held back by lack of expertise in fields such as electronics or aeronautics can always find chemists and biologists . This possibility introduces major uncertainties for Western political leaders , military planners , and intelligence experts who have little experience in forecasting a future not dominated by their own well-understood conventional weapons . For the moment , suspend this nonproliferation perspective and look at biological warfare instead as a business : a small underdeveloped competitor tries to spread its influence at the expense of bigger , richer , more advanced countries like the United States . The viewpoint is like that of a start-up software company ( the early Microsoft ) taking on an industry leader ( IBM ) with deeper technical knowledge and a larger research program . Competing head to head against such an adversary is hopeless , so an alternative field of competition must be found . Chemical or atomic weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now on biological weapons . Also , Iraq is the country that got caught , so more is known about its effort . But many Asian states ( China , Iran , Syria , Pakistan , North Korea , others ) are known to have biological programs . In addition , Russian biological warfare experts are known to be selling their services throughout Asia . Germ warfare is a disruptive technology because it upsets key Western advantages and negates its know-how in fighting a conventional war . It subverts the Western military structure by attacking its vulnerable rear area , the soft inner core of administration , // logistics , and support , along with population centers . This nullifies the great Western advantages in smart weapons and electronic intelligence on the front lines . If the Gulf War is thought of as the prototypical modern war , then biological warfare is the prototypical postmodern war , one that negates the conventional advantages of the modern Western powers . The political sensitivities of Moslem countries such as Saudi Arabia or Qatar require Western military bases to be cordoned off ; hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This drives up the West 's dependence on each base and explains why in the Gulf War there was such a mountain of supplies at each one . Everything had to be stocked in one or two locations . This requirement also conforms , however , to American logistical practice . It is easier to move supplies around one big base than among several smaller ones . With many smaller bases , an enormous intra-theater transportation system would be needed to ferry supplies and equipment back and forth , a system even the U.S. military does not possess . With larger bases , the only requirement is for long-distance haulage to move equipment and supplies from the United States . Once unloaded at the bases , equipment can be sent directly into battle . Note that this practice continues a centuries-long tradition of Western countries operating in Asia 's harsh terrain by limiting the transport of ammunition and supplies to carefully selected compounds . Dependence on a few big bases greatly increases vulnerability to biological attack . The SCUD is not an especially accurate missile , but it is accurate enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the SCUD is an area weapon . The great administrative and technical intricacies of the Western military effort are not seen at the tip of the military spear , but on its shaft . The tip ? the frontline units ? needs ammunition , fuel , and spare parts for its complex vehicles , radars , and radios . Biological weapons attack the shaft , the long , vulnerable part of the Western spear , comprising // trucks , parts inventories , repair shops , and air and sea transportation . The shaft of the spear is not nearly as well protected as the tip is . In combat , airplanes and tanks are sealed off from the outside world to protect their operators and their inside electronics and mechanics . But on bases , motor pools and ammunition stocks are unprotected . Operators need freedom to move about without encumbrance in their resupply and maintenance work . In Clausewitz 's terms , biological weapons move the center of gravity of the battle from the front , where the United States has advantage , to the rear , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shaft " on the spear is technically possible , but extraordinarily expensive . It would entail an enormous reallocation of resources away from the spear 's tip , a difficult trade-off for defense planners to contemplate . Germ weapons target American lives , not planes and tanks . While the subject is a complicated one , the mere loss of equipment is something that is unlikely ever to restrain the United States in war . But the prospect of significant loss of life is a different matter altogether , more so now perhaps than at any time in the past . This center of gravity would have shifted even further had Saddam Hussein succeeded in his plans . Iraq was building the ability to target not only American soldiers but also Israeli civilians and , figuratively , American leaders and the public . And he would have done this in a way that violated the norms of Western warfare , which for historical and cultural reasons hold killing with biological weapons to be an especially gruesome and repugnant method of war . Western conventional weapons are meant to destroy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal is instant demolition . Biological weapons , in contrast , stretch out the death agony for days or weeks , or even years . Whether anything such as death in war can really he described as " clean , " the West 's view is that raining bombs on Iraq was a " clean " campaign . Biological weapons are by their nature " dirty . " They arc outside the hounds of accepted behavior , // and in this they change the game of war to something much more horrible . Innovation occurs in biological warfare , even though it tends not to be recognized in the West because the subject is abhorrent . This is a very shortsighted view . Mixing readily available anthrax and botulinum can result in a whole new compound of terrifying lethality . Such innovation is cheap . It does n't demand an army of highly educated scientists . Unconstrained by American scruples , Iraq could gather data from tests on live prisoners , and it probably knows more about the effects of these weapons on people than the United States does . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human testing has never been conceivable . But in Iraq such tests are known to have been conducted . Germ weapons are indiscriminate not only about whom they kill but where they kill . They depend on the vagaries of wind and rain , which can steer the killing clouds in random directions . In the West this is seen as a major drawback . Integrating biological weapons into conventional forces goes against every precept of predictability and measurability that drives the Western approach to war . This is why germ weapons are so often dismissed as mere terror weapons by Western experts . But this very observation illustrates a larger difference . It compares germ weapons to the precise firepower of instant destruction preferred in the West . Measured this way , of course , they do n't stand up . But from the challenger 's point of view , not scoring well on such standard measures is not a bad thing . A challenger , whether Iraq or Microsoft , knows that by competing in conventional ways it is bound to lose . It also understands that its adversaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much prefer to keep the contest confined to areas where their well-developed skills work to maximum benefit . Confronted with an unconventional challenger , the leaders resort first to denial : " German tanks can not possibly break the Maginot // Line . " " Poorly equipped Viet Cong are no match for U.S. firepower . " " A software company can not possibly knock IBM out of its domination of the PC business . " Then , if the threat mounted by the newcomer proves effective , the dominant player starts to see that its advantages are not so great after all . At this point panic sets in . Morale in the French high command disintegrated . Washington saw a disaster in Southeast Asia that it could not escape from fast enough . And IBM shuffled its executives . Biological weapons , like many disruptive technologies , are the very opposite of Western armaments . They are directed at area targets , not point targets . They operate in the rear area , not at the battle front . They go after the most vulnerable parts of the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biological weapons are design to kill people , not things . They are " dirty " weapons , not clean ones . Accuracy and speed , the touchstones of American military innovation , are largely irrelevant in the field of biological warfare , where specialized command and control arrangements and strategies for use , such as brinkmanship , count for more . COMPETING WITH DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES The military modernization of Asia is taking the course of disruptive technologies ? specifically , the development of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction . Such technologies are transforming military geography and making U.S. bases in Asia , its " forward bases , " vulnerable . The problem is not one of rogue states trying to make trouble . Nor is it that China is challenging the United States , unless possessing a modern military itself constitutes a challenge . Rather , a broad structural change in the technological environment of defense is taking place . Against peasant armies ? even if upgraded by advanced tanks and artillery  --  the United States held the technological advan46 FIRE IN THE EAST tage . Against peasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could increase the killing power of its weapons to offset Asian numbers . But Asia no longer squanders human life in peasant charges against Western firepower , as Mao Zedong , Kim Il Sung , and Ho Chi Minh once did . Economic growth makes life more precious , just as it did in Europe . In place of enormous armies forging national identity through struggle against colonial and capitalist oppressors , advanced technology weapons have become the hallmarks of successful statehood and the symbols of progress . Developing countries have always used Western military technology . But until the 1980s they imported it directly from the West without indigenous development . The shah of Iran and others were willing buyers of the West 's latest military toys . There was little concern about these purchases because poor training and a lack of maintenance greatly limited their effectiveness . The shah had a thin overlay of modern Western equipment , a patina of a modern force , atop an unmotivated and undisciplined army . Most recognized this for what it was , a rump army propped up by Western technicians who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held in most other countries that imported their armaments from the West . The abrupt collapse of the shah exposed this sham . Like the army of South Vietnam , when his army was called on to act , it melted away . All of the modern equipment imported from the West ? the jets , the tanks , the guns ? went for naught . The Western firepower of Iran was built on a foundation of sand . The lesson was reinforced in the Gulf War . The Iraqi army fell over itself trying to surrender to the Western coalition . The conclusion many drew was that developing countries could not simply adopt the weapons of the West but needed a much deeper social and economic transformation to use these weapons in the way a Western army would . The entire society needed to modernize , not just its weapons . It was also said that totalitarian governments itDISRUPTIVE // particular did not have the " openness " needed to develop the modern fighting force , even though the Soviet Red Army , the Wehrmacht of Germany , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they performed rather well militarily . If only massive social transformation could produce an effective fighting force ; then developing world military forces were many decades away from standing up to the West . But while the shah 's Iran fit the old model of importing from the West , Iraq , China , North Korea , India , Pakistan , and Syria were taking a different path . Rather than shopping for the latest in Western armaments , they redirected their efforts toward developing disruptive technologies . Iraq broadened its germ warfare program , North Korea started its missile buildup , China began its short- and medium-range ballistic missile program , and Indian nuclear scientists started to make small nuclear bombs for its missiles and air force . The West continued to pursue its sustaining technologies , weapons that reinforced its military advantages . Cruise missiles were made more accurate , tanks faster , communications more intricate , and aircraft more stealthy . But in Asia the shift was from sustaining technologies imported from the West to disruptive technologies that overturned the West 's main advantages . The contest was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West and the disruptive technologies of Asia . One effect was to make fixed military bases an endangered species . Biological weapons make bases vulnerable ; in combination with ballistic missiles , they present an overwhelming threat to bases . Missiles almost always get through to their targets because their speed makes them hard to shoot down , much harder than an airplane . When tipped with atomic warheads , or biological or chemical ones , the danger is made all the greater . Their disadvantage lack of . accuracy no longer matters as much . // Disruptive technologies have changed the military game in Asia because they enable Asian countries to try to play catch-up with the West . They deny the West 's assumptions about its capabilities , such as the freedom to fight from advanced bases , the ability to move forces to Asia without danger of harassment , and the ability to restrict a war to conventional forces confined to a small geographic box without the risk that it will spill over to a wider area . ZONES OF EXCLUSION Ballistic missiles break down the entire strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the key vulnerability that Western powers in Asia have always faced , but that until recently Asian nations could not exploit . The effect of the current shift to missile forces in the belt of countries from Israel to North Korea is not that they will be launched against American bases at the first opportunity . The more interesting and important transformation is spatial : the shift is creating strategic exclusion zones and turning what historically were bases for projecting influence into Asia into places of high danger and political sensitivity . Images from the Gulf War tell a revealing story here . Although a great deal of attention was given to the super-accurate bombs and missiles of the United States , it was the freedom to concentrate military power from around the world that was the real key to victory . U.S. jet fighters , tanks , and helicopters require high levels of maintenance and enormous logistical support . In the outside world ? the civilian world of CNN and PBS ? the enduring image of the war is one of U.S. laser-guided missiles landing right on the roofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compare the Gulf War to a computer video game . The reputation for I. l.S. military invincibility was fed by these video clips. // On the inside , that is , among the Joint Chiefs of Staff , the image that symbolizes the Gulf War is much more prosaic . It is the photograph showing the mountain of supplies built up in Saudi Arabia between August 1990 and January 1991 . An immense store of arms and munitions was amassed during the six months before the shooting started , a testament to America 's ability to move equipment halfway around the world to the middle of a desert . It allowed the United States to be a military superpower in a place that initially lacked water or shelter . But it required a big base to house it all . Without bases , there can be no concentration of military power . Weapons can not be stored , let alone massed for use . No bases , no weapons . It is America 's singular military weakness in Asia . The different weapons that can be used against U.S. bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed as parts of a bigger whole : a pattern of disruptive technology aimed at the West 's military freedom to operate at will in Asia . Nuclear Weapons Nuclear weapons destroy bases , ports , and airfields with a single blow . Getting them to the target can be the hardest part of their delivery , because placing them aboard aircraft makes them liable to be shot down . The ballistic missile reduces this risk considerably . Asian nuclear weapons make military intervention a much riskier proposition for the West . The danger , however small , of a nuclear attack against a base or an allied city is likely to translate into caution about provocative military operations . Nuclear weapons create distance between the United States and its Asian allies because they raise the stakes for U.S. intervention . Atomic bombs , because they offset the vast superiority of U.S. conventional forces , arc the premier disruptive technology at work in the world today . // Chemical and Biological Weapons Chemical and biological weapons are the disruptive technologies of choice for countries that are unable to cross the nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear arsenals . If successfully delivered , these weapons can shut down a military base for a long time , owing to the difficulty of decontamination . The mere possibility that these weapons might be used can force extraordinary burdens on the United States ? requiring troops to be inoculated , outfitted with respirators , dressed in rubber protective clothing . And if these measures were to fail , the prospect of Marines vomiting , gasping , and writhing in agony would give any American president plenty to think about before putting forces in harm 's way . Cruise Missiles Cruise missiles are small , unmanned , aircraftlike vehicles that can fly below the radar of ships or the warning radars used to defend airfields . China has cruise missiles and has sold them to Iran . Many other countries have shown an interest in them . Highly accurate , they can strike targets without any risk to a pilot and can be armed with nuclear , chemical , biological , or conventional warheads . They are useful for attacking ships , since they skim low over the sea , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy operating in confined waters such as the Persian Gulf . During the cold war U.S. ships had less reason to approach coastal areas . On the open ocean , against an enemy that does not possess a blue-water navy , cruise missiles are less of a threat . Forward engagement brings ships closer to land , where they are vulnerable to cruise missiles fired from the coast or small patrol boats . // Sea Mines Mines receive little public attention , but they have become more dangerous for the same reason that cruise missiles have . Ocean depths are too great for most sea mines . But near the coast or in relatively shallow waters like the Persian Gulf , mines can be laid on the sea bottom , where they are hard to find . Old-fashioned floating mines , like the ones seen in World War II movies ? big metal spheres studded with spikes ? are easy to locate and destroy . Bottom mines stay anchored on the sea floor until they fire rocket-propelled charges up at a passing ship . The ship does not even have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct it to its target . China and Russia make these mines and sell them to many countries . They are difficult to locate and , once found , difficult to remove , sometimes requiring that frogman teams physically take them apart . Sweeping these mines is often compared to cutting the grass on a football field with a manual push mower . It can be done , but it takes a long time . Space Satellites and Drone Aircraft Satellites are the eyes and ears of a modern exclusion zone . They can spot reinforcements moving into Asia by tracking military aircraft and ships as they approach their forward bases . Drones are miniature airplanes with cameras and other sensors aboard that fly for eighty hours or more . They are cheap and can monitor wide areas . It could eventually be possible to attack surface ships with missiles using these systems . The combined impact of these technologies will be to change Asia 's military geography as fundamentally as it changed when the airplane made the maritime colonial empire obsolete . Whether it takes five years or fifteen is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more difficult in the future than it has been in the // past . The National Defense Panel , a Pentagon advisory body , recognized the danger in its December 1997 report " Transforming Defense : National Security in the Twenty-first Century . " The panel 's description of the future security environment states : Even if we retain the necessary bases and port infrastructure to support forward deployed forces they will be vulnerable to strikes that could reduce or neutralize their utility . Precision strikes , weapons of mass destruction , and cruise and ballistic missiles all present threats to our forward presence , particularly as stand-off ranges increase . So , too , do they threaten access to strategic geographic areas . Widely available national and commercial spacebased systems providing imagery , communication , and position location will greatly multiply the vulnerability of fixed and , perhaps , mobile forces as well . This trend affects the United States more than any other country , because of its status as the world 's sole superpower . Formerly safe areas around the Asian perimeter are becoming dangerous to operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now contested by Asian powers themselves . Asia 's perimeter lands and seas are now overlaid by the tracking and reconnaissance grids of a halfdozen different nations . China can point its surveillance system to the waters around Taiwan , where in the past it was for all practical purposes blind . Iran can monitor the sea lanes in the Persian Gulf , while India keeps watch on the Indian Ocean . THE LEARNING CURVE This emerging military situation tends to go unrecognized because the early performance of disruptive technologies is usually very poor . Ballistic missiles in the hands of a developing country start out as unreliable and inaccurate . Many blow up on the launch // pad . Throughout the 1980s and well into the 1990s the standard joke in American intelligence circles was that they posed a greater threat to their developers than to any foreign enemy . After Indias nuclear tests in the summer of 1998 , likewise , evidence that some of the shots were duds was taken to mean that the Indians could n't pull off a modern atomic bomb effort . The overwhelming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failures in Asian military modernization . This has long been the Western view of Asia : that it is incapable of importing Western arms to good effect because it lacks the social and organizational skills to operate the equipment successfully . At one time Americans took a similar view of Asian businesses , that they would never become competitive threats to Western firms because they lacked professional management skills . Disruptive technologies are especially prone to being underestimated by Westerners because they often present an unfamiliar package of performance attributes . Consider missiles . It is well known that Iraq , North Korea , and others have tremendous interest in missiles . Certainly , a great deal of attention is given to missiles by the U.S. intelligence community . But using a Western rational framework , it is difficult to spot advances that do not fit standard profiles . Ballistic missiles are an ideal platform for innovation because changes are easy to make . The Iraqi missiles fired at Israel and U.S. bases in Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War were known in Iraq as the Al Husayn missile , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the Iraqis improved the Soviet SCUD 's 180-mile range to 400 miles . In the United States an entirely new missile program would have been started to replace a 180-mile missile with a 400-mile one . New technologies would have been added , with many tests . What Iraq did was simply cut up three SCUDs to get the parts and metal shell needed for the longer-range Al Husayn . The warhead weight was reduced so that it could be carried on the new missile . // With these design changes , the missile had very poor accuracy and very little punch . Western intelligence simply could not believe that the Iraqis , or anyone else , would make such a weapon . Only in early February 1988 , after Iraq fired 180 Al Husayns at Iranian cities , did it become clear that Iraq had built a long-range version of the Soviet missile . Despite its inaccuracy and small payload , it had enormous strategic impact on ending the war with Iran , and it nearly brought Israel into the Gulf War three years later . In April 1998 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressional review panel , this test could not have been anticipated " on the basis of any known pattern of technical development . " U.S. satellites had searched for the gantries that would hold up the rockets , for test flights , and for increased activity at known missile plants . But nothing was found . Pakistan had simply fielded the missile without the testing that would have been done in the United States . In July 1998 Iran launched a missile with a range of 800 miles , sufficient to attack Israel and U.S. bases in Saudi Arabia . This , too , was not anticipated . Earlier the CIA had declared such a launch to be unlikely for at least ten more years . The development pattern of Asian missiles is hard to understand because they are looked at through Western eyes . Iraq , Iran , Pakistan , and North Korea simply went ahead without the elaborate safety , testing , and scientific controls that would be standard practice in the United States and that would tip off observers to the existence of a program . Iran and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , effectively hiding activity from overhead satellites . Such procedures are in sharp contrast to cold war missile-building , with Washington and Moscow cooperating so that each could see the other side 's forces . Western observers invariably extrapolate from their own history . There is growing concern , 1cor example , over ' hina getting an airerah carrier , developing an occ.ingoing navy , and // modernizing its air force to challenge the United States . But for China to play this catch-up game would be virtually impossible . It could easily take fifty years to acquire the needed aircraft , electronics , and crew skills . It would be so costly that even to start down this road would be a sign that Chinese leadership had taken leave of its senses . But improving missile accuracy or building germ weapons is a different matter . This is a much cheaper way to shift the balance of power because it goes after key Western weaknesses . GOING BALLISTIC Chinese missile development is a case in point . In 1995 and 1996 Beijing used a series of missile tests to intimidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but their payloads could just as easily have been explosive warheads . The first tests were apparently precipitated by President Lee Teng-hui 's visit to the United States in June 1995 . China was angered by the implication of diplomatic recognition bestowed on Taiwan by President Lee 's visit . The second tests were triggered by the Taiwanese elections of March 1996 , during which President Lee seemed to flirt with the idea of Taiwanese independence . Beijing has long said that any declaration of independence could result in the use of force to return Taiwan to China . The urgent question among U.S. observers was : what was the Chinese leadership up to with such missile diplomacy ? What were they trying to signal ? Did it represent the political leaders bowing to pressures from the army , and if so , what did this say about the future direction of Chinese foreign policy ? Such questions are like the old practice of Kremlinology : fragments of speeches and other tidbits of information were pieced together to make long-term forecasts Soviet behavior. // But what the tests really showed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests took place in July 1995 , when the Chinese fired two DF-15 missiles daily for three straight days . The DF-15 ( for Dong Feng , or East Wind ) is a mobile missile with a range of 600 miles . It is launched from a trailer , which can be hidden from satellite or aerial reconnaissance in the same way that Saddam hid his SCUDs during the Gulf War . The 1995 tests were not a success . Of six missiles fired , one had to be destroyed over China because of a guidance malfunction . Two others hit the far outer edge of a predesignated target zone . Intelligence reports suggest that for the three missiles that landed inside the target zone , accuracy was poor . The standard measure of missile accuracy is the circular probable error , the radius of a circle centered on the target within which half of the missiles will fall . Using this , the DF15 in 1995 had an accuracy of 2.4 miles . With this accuracy , it would be ineffective with a high explosive warhead . Only a nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would possess the necessary kill radius to compensate for the poor accuracy . When another test was conducted in March 1996 , matters had changed considerably . Four missiles were launched at two target areas , rather than one , in the South and East China seas , one near the Taiwanese port of Kaohsiung and the other near the port of Keelung . This time all four missiles landed with near pinpoint accuracy . How could accuracy have improved so dramatically in only eight months ? First , it must be understood what an amazing achievement this was . In 1958 the Atlas , the first American long-range missile , had an accuracy of one mile . Since accuracy was such an important factor , a tremendous amount of research was devoted to improving it . Only by the early 1980s did the U.S. Minuteman I I I and Pershing I I missiles get down to accuracies measured in hundreds of feet or less . Iikewise , in the late I950s the Soviet SS 6 missile had an accuracy of // one mile . Only with their SS-18s and - 19s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hundred feet . What took the United States and the Soviet Union twenty-five years to accomplish , China duplicated in eight months . The DF-15 missile has what is called an inertial navigation system . This is an onboard computer programmed to keep the missile on a path predetermined before launch . Once launched , there is no further communication with the missile . With pure inertial navigation , there is no new information on whether it is on or off course . It is difficult , but not impossible , to achieve high accuracies unless the computer aboard is extremely advanced ? comparable , for instance , to American or Soviet guidance technology of the early 1980s . This requirement was thought to be beyond China 's capacity in 1996 . It is possible that the Chinese obtained such a system from Russia , or that engineers obtained the know-how there and built it themselves . Another possibility is that a midcourse correction was fed into the missile guidance system when it was in flight . An inflight missile 's position location can be obtained from navigation satellites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the missile actually is . Deviations between the two can be calculated by the onboard guidance computer , with the results fed to a small propulsion system to put it back on course . There are currently two space-based systems that allow this calculation , one American ? the Global Positioning System , or GPS ? and a Russian system called Glonass . China has entered into joint ventures with international firms to manufacture GPS and Glonass receivers . And it is known that it has a research program to link the DF-15 to navigation satellites . If so , this would be a much faster way to improve missile accuracy . Whatever the method , evidence pointed to Chinese confidence that accuracy had improved . The impact areas for the tests were moved // from one hundred miles off Taiwan in 1995 to twenty miles offshore in the 1996 exercise . The implications of Chinese missile improvements are ominous for Taiwan . This island nation is extremely dependent on its critical infrastructures . Launching forty-five missiles with conventional warheads , China could virtually close the ports , airfields , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil storage of a nation that needs continual replenishment from the outside world . This could be done with minimal civilian casualties , comparable in size to attacks the United States has launched on three occasions against Iraq since the Gulf War ? attacks criticized as " pinpricks " because of their small numbers . The difference is that the United States was not trying to shoot down Iraq 's economy . SUPERPOWER LITE It is important to appreciate just how precarious the U.S. military position in Asia is . The large U.S. military presence there is concentrated in a small number of bases , while the bulk of U.S. military forces are back in North America . Bases in Turkey , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Qatar , Diego Garcia , Guam , Japan , and South Korea are vital to span the immense Asian rim . Asia is four times larger than Europe , effectively limiting American military power to its periphery . Even so , over such a huge distance it is impossible for one set of bases to be used for all contingencies . Airfields in Dhahran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , nor do prepositioned army stocks in Qatar help defend Taiwan . For this very reason , war plans during the cold war always called for much earlier nuclear weapon use in Asia than in Europe . After the cold war Washington changed its geographic fi ) ctts . It gave greater strategic importance to Asia , acknowledging peace in // Europe . Between 1988 and 1996 U.S. armed forces , active duty and reserve , were cut from 3.3 million to 2.4 million . But Asia was shielded from troop cuts ; 210,000 troops were removed from Europe , 86 percent of the total reduction in active-duty personnel . Troop strength in the Middle East actually saw a small increase , while the Pacific underwent a token reduction of 32,000 . Washington downsized from the cold war and reoriented its forces and strategy for Asia . The political strategy accompanying these changes is detailed in a 1998 Pentagon document titled " The U.S. Security Strategy for the East Asia ? Pacific Region . " Cutting through the diplomatic language , with its support of democracy and open markets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one , at the moment , is trying to open . According to this report , the United States stays in Asia to forestall national competition among Asians ; to reassure everyone that the United States will not allow the use of force to settle major issues like Taiwan or Korea ; and finally , to be a substitute major power , which is preferable to an Asian country filling that role . The U.S. policy community has convinced itself that however much the Chinese may dislike America 's presence , Beijing surely prefers it to the alternative of a rearmed Japan . One critical part of the U.S. strategy , though nowhere mentioned in the Pentagon document , is essential to making it acceptable at home . At a time of scant public interest in foreign affairs and concern over the federal budget , forward engagement can be had on the cheap . Defense budgets have been trimmed back in the 1990s , with no Soviet Union left to fight , but no other country has emerged to challenge the United States as a superpower . Global leadership is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of GNP each year . But the U.S. forward engagement strategy was forged in the comparatively benevolent world of the early 1990s . A curve in the shape // of a broad U describes adversarial military power in the 1990s . The downward leg on the left side marks the collapse of the Soviet Union . The ascending curve on the right signifies the change from research programs to actual deployment of missiles throughout Asia . The price of global domination is about to go up , sharply . The United States already has restricted freedom in its forward bases . Political strictures come from the need to obtain advance approval from host countries . In the Middle East , South Korea , and Japan , this can be tricky . Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states do not want to be seen as American vassals , nor can they risk the domestic political dangers of virtually conceding their sovereign territory to the United States . When the outside danger is great , as it was after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and has been several times since , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so requires frequent and costly logistical moves . Host countries , and Washington , have to make a commitment decision to move forces forward each and every time there is a crisis . This is altogether different from the cold war , when there was a tacit understanding between Washington and Moscow that both sides rushing forces forward would be a path to nuclear confrontation , so a mutual inhibition grew up about sudden movements of combat troops . This slower tempo of military action dampened escalation . This mutual restraint has given way to a new dynamic . Forces are rushed to the front , in Iraq or Taiwan , whenever the political situation seems to call for it . The dynamic is now a sequence of crises , near-crises , presumed crises , and noncrises , each with a consequential political decision to move U.S. forces . These movements are carefully scripted by planners because they involve a staggering array of supplies and people coordinated to arrive in exactly the right order . But political consent is not so easy to plan . Host-nation politics may conflict with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any kind of delay ? is the // nightmare of Pentagon planners . Then forces could be set to move , with nowhere to park at the other end ! This cycle of moving forces forward followed by hauling them back puts the United States in the position of constantly reacting to Iraqi provocation . One cycle influences the next , presenting opportunities for countries to try a little gamesmanship . Saddam provokes a minor crisis by tossing weapons inspectors out of the country or moving a brigade toward Kuwait . For the United States , each such occasion triggers a buildup of forces , costing a minimum of $2 billion , plus the political cost of going to the nervous Gulf states each time for permission to land . " Spoofing , " or purposefully staging crises for the sole purpose of drawing a reaction , has become one of Iraq 's favorite ploys . It is done to annoy Washington and to force U.S. leaders to cry wolf so many times that support among host nations and allies is undermined . ARMS CONTROL AS STRATEGY This game will become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With missiles , the country provoking a U.S. deployment can threaten to hit the landing areas of incoming U.S. forces . U.S. strategy in Asia depends on arms control to forestall this from happening . It creates a fascinating juxtaposition . A legalistic Western concept , arms control by treaty , is the means by which the West attempts to maintain its monopoly of the technology used to dominate Asia . If negotiating with a Westernized Soviet Union on arms control was difficult , doing so with the many countries of Asia to preserve this advantage promises to be even more so . The United States has pursued with great energy an agreement known as the Missile Technology Control Regime . This thirty-onenation agreement bans international trade in critical components // needed for missiles , navigational computers , and guidance systems . It is one of the principal tools used to retard the development of missiles in Iran , Iraq , Pakistan , North Korea , and Syria . Its success is ragged , however . Russia and China sell missile technology with nearimpunity , and the Missile Technology Control Regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marketplace with their missiles . In addition , recent interpretations of the agreement allow export of space-launched rockets , of a kind used to put weather and communications satellites in orbit . Since there is virtually no difference between space-launched rockets and ICBMs , an absurd situation results . Obviously to disguise their true military purpose , countries are now building space exploration rockets with short-notice firing systems on mobile trailers . There have been successes in arms control . Beijing has agreed to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty , which bans all testing of nuclear warheads . Yet thinking about arms control in terms of a scorecard of successes and failures misses a larger point . Arms control is now being asked to sustain permanently an asymmetric advantage . By locking countries into a low state of military development , the United States can maintain its superiority on the cheap . There is a tradition of using arms control in this way , a tradition neglected during the cold war when arms control was directed toward stabilizing the balance of terror or , more rarely , reducing it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan signed an arms control agreement to limit battleship construction . Its purpose was to limit the Japanese navy so that Britain and the United States could keep their global military leads without paying for new battleships . It was the first time that Western nations colluded to constrain the military modernization of an Asian industrial power . Using arms control for one-sided strategic advantage still allows a country to argue that such agreements are in the general interest of mankind and international peace . Beating swords into plowDISRUPTIVE // shares is a much more appealing argument than cold strategic logic . Placing arms control at the center of diplomacy also makes it seem that a new cooperative security system is emerging in which countries will refrain from threatening one another . Yet the reality is not quite this simple . Preservation of the asymmetric situation whereby the greatest military power in Asia is not Asian depends on arms control . But China will never sign an arms control agreement that makes U.S. bases in Asia invulnerable . Nor would Iran , Iraq , North Korea , or even Israel give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement , the appearance that it permanently locks China and others into technological inferiority to the West , would be clear to all . Failure to reach arms control agreement thus undermines America 's whole Asian strategy . The stage is set for arms control to take on a greater significance even than it did in the cold war , when the objective was stabilization rather than one-sided advantage . In recent years there have been many diplomatic disputes over sales of sensitive technology by China and Russia to nations in the Middle East and over Chinese sales to Pakistan . These disputes are a pale harbinger of what is to come , for their importance will increase as the costs and problems of defending forward bases become impossible to ignore . AMERICA 'S MAGINOT LINE If forward engagement is to mean anything , it requires credible military power on the Asian periphery . Yet the foundation of that power , forward bases , is eroding . The result ? only somewhat masked by the triumphal rhetoric of cooperative engagement and strategic partnership ? is a deterioration of the long-term capability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to do . The United States is react64 FIRE IN THE EAST ing to these developments with a major initiative in defensive missiles , that is , missiles that can shoot down ballistic missiles . Missile defense has been around a long time . But in the past it has focused on national missile defense , protection of the U.S. homeland from Soviet attack . Now , in an attempt to defend forward bases , anti-missile missiles are needed to protect them . Protection of forward bases is likely to produce an American Maginot Line , a defensive effort to stay in Asia for another fifty years by protecting the bases of a bygone era . Like the original Maginot Line , it could easily produce a defense psychology as well , a posture of increasing caution and restraint . Forward bases could become like the Crusaders ' forts of the Middle East ? heavily defended , isolated outposts with little effect beyond their immediate perimeter . Missile defense is a lot like hitting a bullet with another bullet . The difference is that missiles travel faster than bullets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an incoming missile has to be destroyed far from its target . Warheads travel so fast that they can still do great damage when armed with nuclear or biological warheads after being hit because momentum will carry even a damaged missile toward its target . Hence the daunting problems of defending against ballistic missiles : the speed with which they travel , the short time in which to get a kill , and the need to demolish the warhead far from the target . It is difficult for nonspecialists to imagine the kinematics of a missile ? anti-missile engagement . Stopping a missile is altogether different from interdicting a car . Saddam 's Al Husayn and the Chinese DF-15 fly between 5,000 and 7,000 feet per second at their maximum . An object traveling at sixty miles an hour is moving at 88 feet per second . A shotgun fires at about 900 feet per second . The U.S. army 's M-16 rifle , designed for high-velocity fire , fires rounds traveling 3,200 feet per second . A ballistic missile travels twice as fast as a bullet from an M-16. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch point . Then , only a few defenders are needed to cover a large area . An airplane with an anti-missile or high-energy laser aboard ? a spacebased missile shooting down at the earth ? or a naval ship close to the firing point provide efficient geographic coverage . Otherwise , a large number of point defenses protecting widely spread targets are needed , and the cost of the defense goes up . This geometry means that the target , sensors , and anti-missile killers are widely dispersed , spread apart over the earth 's horizon . A complex system of space satellites and computers is needed to track the attacking missile and bring the whole defense together . At the altitudes where missiles fly , the air is so thin that blast waves are much attenuated , so an interceptor ca n't simply blow up in the vicinity of its target missile ; it has to hit it directly . Weight considerations argue for a fast , lightweight missile , homing on its target by infrared ( heat ) sensors , smashing into it at such high speed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaiting solution . National missile defense of a kind considered throughout the cold war , most prominently in President Ronald Reagan 's Strategic Defense Initiative ( SDI ) , is an easier problem than theater ballistic missile defense . ICBMs launched from Russia have a flight time of thirty minutes to most targets in the United States , compared to five to eleven minutes for a typical short-range missile . The longer time allows interceptor missiles to reach sufficient altitude to take on the incoming warheads before they start to close on their targets . With eleven minutes or less , that is barely possible , and then only if everything happens almost instantaneously . The defense must have a tightly scripted response of virtually automated actions . The smallest delay or malfunction can undermine the mission . In 1993 an important test of defensive missiles showed the high level of anxiety in the Pentagon about ballistic missile attack on forward bases . Chemical weapons , like the notorious VX nerve agent , // are best delivered not as a single bomb package , but as a bundle of small bomblets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses minicanisters filled with nerve gas packed into a warhead . Warheads can be built to cast these canisters over a wide area . For contaminating a base , port , airfield , or any area target , this is exactly what is needed . In the 1993 test a missile carrying thirty-eight canisters of water was used to simulate a ballistic missile armed with such a chemical warhead . It was annihilated by the defender missile . But that did n't stop the debate over whether theater ballistic missile defense will work . Some critics charge that tests are conducted to minimize difficulty , that in effect they are rigged for success . Others counter that experiments like the 1993 test demonstrate that it is not impossible that these technologies could shoot down missiles . Everyone agrees , however , that the problem is extremely challenging : the smallest glitch could mean failure , given the high speeds and short reaction times . Whether ballistic missile defenses will work depends on technical specifics and geometry . American technological know-how could fare well here ? our defenses might even be good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to be thought through , complications and details that illustrate a larger point : missile defense is in part a technical problem , but it is also a political and economic one with a specific geographic shape dictated by the fact that American forward bases ring the Asian coastal rim . A principal rationale of this system is cooperative engagement , but the missile defense issue shows a major disconnect . If our bases are so welcomed throughout Asia , why are so many countries building forces that will make them obsolete ? Missile defense has not come to grips with this problem , and it is fundamental . For thirty years every administration that has faced the national missile defense question has done so recognizing that the only way for it to work is to limit the size and character of the threat . Whether // an administration favored missile defense or opposed it , all saw the imperative of getting a handle on the offensive side of the ledger . If offensive threats were not limited , defense would have to invest vast resources to counter them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . In the late 1960s Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara initially opposed missile defense for the United States because the Soviets could easily counter it by building more missiles , essentially exhausting the defense with cheaper offensive missiles . The Nixon administration initially favored defense , but only as arms control negotiations were simultaneously pushed to limit the enemy 's offensive capabilities . This produced the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks , known as SALT . Likewise , the Reagan administration advanced its Strategic Defense Initiative along with the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks ( START ) , again an effort to get a manageable handle on the offensive threat . These treaties worked for the purposes intended ; over a period of some thirty years Moscow and Washington put limits on their offensive missiles . The two cooperatively engaged . But there is no strategic partnership between the United States and Asia on missiles . Neither China nor India is involved in the START talks , or in any talks that might follow it . India and China have gone out of their way to argue that until the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have , there is not even any point in bringing them into negotiations . With the recent Clinton administration decision to rewrite the ABM Treaty , the chances are even thinner that any agreement on long-range missiles will be reached . Nor is there any plan to limit shorter-range missiles . The potential contributions of a revolutionary new arms control initiative are easy to identify here , but difficult to accomplish . Washington could push for limits on medium- or short-range missiles . Just as there is a call for a ban on land mines , so could there also be , in theory , a ban // on at least certain missiles . The current Missile Technology Control Regime does n't try to do this , for it limits cross-border trade only in missile parts , not in missile possession . Such a revolutionary new arms control plan would be exceedingly difficult to verify , even approximately . Without some limit on the number of offensive missiles , defense becomes exceedingly expensive , partly because of the nature of disruptive technologies , which are platforms for innovation . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . Missiles can be made to fly faster by streamlining their warheads , thus forcing a defender to retrofit its own force to counter it . They can be made to spiral in a path that is difficult for an interceptor to hit , or they can carry decoys to distract the defender 's missiles . The number of options is enormous and nearly always cheaper than the cost to the defender of coming up with a response . If a faster warhead is built with less chance of detection by radar , for example , it necessitates a new suite of radars and space tracking systems to find it . This is the significance of Chinese espionage against American nuclear weapon labs . It is not the spying that is significant , because all countries do that . But the object of the spying is highly revealing . Chinese spies sought the design for the deadly small warheads of America 's nuclear arsenal . This espionage target was not some general collection of American technical data . Rather , it fit the clear pattern of Chinese defense modernization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missiles , submarines , and the ICBMs that can strike the United States . In short , China wanted a modern nuclear force of lightweight warheads . With these , whole new areas of strategic innovation are opened up . With the stolen bomb designs China has now compressed two decades of nuclear weapons research into a few short years . Together , the ballistic missile and warhead improvements give China // enormous flexibility in responding to American actions , on Taiwan or on any other issue for that matter . Is Washington sending antiballistic missiles to Japan and South Korea of a kind that could be transferred to Taiwan ? No problem . All Beijing has to do is keep the plants running to field another hundred missiles , something that is now relatively cheap to do because the hard part , the knowledge of how to make them , is solved courtesy of the loose security controls of Washington 's engagement policy toward China . Once the factories are up and running it is cheap to keep a second shift working , especially given Chinese labor costs . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , 200 missiles are there . In a few years , a thousand missiles are likely to be pointed at the island . The mix of these missiles ? the fraction that are short range and capable of hitting Taiwan , and those of longer range that can take out American bases in Japan and South Korea ? is entirely up to the Chinese . By tilting the mixture toward longer-range missiles , Beijing not only turns America 's Asian bases into hostages ; she also inhibits U.S. power in the whole Pacific Basin . Without size limits on the offensive force through arms control , the economics of defending forward bases becomes prohibitive , spelling the end of superpower lite . It can be done , but not cheaply , and certainly not with the defense budgets of the 1990s . There is an additional political anxiety . Political tensions are exacerbated when one party or another feels constantly behind in the game . Sooner or later , Washington is going to get irked at Chinese missile deployments that force a fresh round of theater missile defense expenditures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the cold war the Soviets leaked false information about some of their missiles , exaggerating their capabilities essentially for the purpose of infuriating and frustrating the Pentagon . It is n't hard to imagine Iraq or China doing the same thing . Washington and Moscow considered missile defenses in a very // different context from what the United States might face in Asia . In the cold war we were protecting ICBMs in super-hardened , underground concrete silos . If the defenses allowed the ICBMs to survive for a few hours , they had done their job . Bases are called " soft " targets for a reason . Exposed troops , airplanes , equipment , repair stations , and bomb stocks would need a virtually impermeable defensive shield , far more reliable than anything offered by President Ronald Reagan 's SDI program . Unlike national missile defense , the protective bubble would be called on against repeated salvos . The war of the cities in the Iran-Iraq conflict saw Baghdad stretch out its attacks over six weeks . That the United States is even considering defenses for its bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crusader forts in the Middle East . These forts did survive for a long time . The United States could go down this road if it opts to look at the problem in the narrow terms of deciding simply whether defenses will or wo n't work . It might do so , despite all the technological problems . But the important issue is not whether some missiles can be shot down , but whether the United States can remain an Asian military power in the future in the way it has been in the past by building a protective bubble around its forward bases . It almost certainly can not . To stay a relevant player in the Asian military game , more farreaching and expensive changes will be required . Say good-bye to superpower lite . It is worth emphasizing that the initiative in this game originated in Asia , with its missile programs . There is a new security environment , one of the United States reacting to Asian initiatives , not shaping them to head them off in the first place . An anti-missile system does not increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain ? if the system works as planned . The reactive character of this strategy has not received the attention it deserves . // Civilian leaders , not military generals , are behind the move to weapons of mass destruction . These weapons offer a way to redirect the bloated and politicized military establishments that have grown up in Asia . The generals oppose them as a diversion of money away from the traditional army . But rulers can use them to reshape their armed forces for the post-postcolonial era , when giant land armies are more of a burden than a benefit . Seen this way , weapons of mass destruction do not represent the lurch toward militarization that they are often made out to be . Instead , they are civilian attempts to extend the modernization of the economy to the military sector . Iraq , Iran , and North Korea all have civilian governments . They are not democratic or elected , but they are civilian . Generals do n't run these countries ; they answer to the civilian rulers . This is also the case in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military to stay in power . These regimes are nothing like the tin-pot military dictatorships often found in Africa and Latin America , where generals hijack control to install a junta to run the show . Even Iraq 's ruler , Saddam Hussein , has used the power of the nation-state , of civilian // administrators and engineering technocrats , to modernize his country 's economy and military . He may share certain temperamental features with Idi Amin , the former military dictator in Uganda , but he is far more dangerous to the outside world than Amin ever was because he mobilized Iraq 's national energies in ways that include , but go well beyond , pointing the gun at his own citizens . Economic modernization requires civilian leaders to control the army organization . Big infantry forces were the key institutions in the postcolonial era after World War II . They were essential for keeping order and preventing outside powers from causing trouble during the early days of nationhood . This was a time of explosive social transformation , when villagers were moving to the city and peasants were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war between states but civil war within the state . ' The large armies of China , India , and Pakistan held those tensions in check . But in most of Asia industrialization and urbanization are well under way , and the armed forces are no longer needed to see the state through this transition . Very little benefit comes from maintaining an oversized , poorly trained army . Public order is better kept by specialized paramilitary units and police than by the army . The generals only meddle in politics and business . The old army is also useless in meeting the external threats posed from other countries with their own weapons of mass destruction . Militarism ? the triumph of the generals over civilians promoting economic growth ? is in retreat across Asia . Yet this is the very time when the spread of missiles and weapons of mass destruction has // accelerated . Western observers are baffled by this . With the cold war over , and with economic growth the priority across most of Asia , what do these countries want with missiles and atom bombs ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military 's focus outward , giving it a new role in national defense , and not coincidentally distracting it from meddling in politics and business . Paradoxically , if the United States could somehow increase the political influence of the military in Asia , it would slow the proliferation of nuclear weapons , for what the old generals really want is a better-equipped version of the force they had in 1970 . But from the civilian point of view , that 's an expensive way to prepare to lose the next war . REMODELING THE ASIAN MILITARY Armies reflect their strategic environment . In postcolonial Asia the army was an institution with which to forge a new national identity transcending the regional and religious differences that colonial rulers manipulated to stay in power . The army was an instrument of mass indoctrination , a giant school with a core curriculum of nationhood . It was not a professional fighting force , for the army did not spend its time perfecting its battlefield skills . Instead , it focused on projects that increased national cohesiveness , such as helping farmers bring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ten largest armies in the world . The reason for this was political , not military . Millions were trained to identify with the nation rather than with their ethnic group , tribe , caste , religion , region , or village . Although such local self-identification endures , it is transcended by something else : identification with the nation . Army size was dictated as much by this nationalization effort as by foreign threats . In China the army had a much more critical role to play in building revolutionary fervor than in countering foreign // aggression . Chinese troops were sent to the countryside to build railroads and thereby inspire others with their Communist zeal . In India the army 's role was less direct . It stayed out of politics but still served as a giant training camp for creating " Indians . " That is the reason it got so large . The Asian army , with origins ( typically ) in revolt against the colonial government , became politicized through its nation-building activities . Then there was little to stop it from entering the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Germany the armed forces do not own businesses or play in politics , at least not to anything like the degree they do in much of Asia . In China and other Asian countries , the armed forces were the king makers , and political leaders had to buy them off by giving officers control of business monopolies and sweet retirement jobs . In Indonesia the army ran the state oil monopoly . Officers were often paid with stock in the company , giving them direct ownership rights . In China the People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) got into tourism , toy manufacturing , textiles , and missile components . In South Korea retired officers were given key jobs in the big industrial groups . Under the shah , Iran 's oil business was populated with military favorites . Military politics became the rule rather than the exception in postcolonial Asia . In Indonesia , China , South Korea , Pakistan , and throughout the Middle East , gaining political office required getting the support of the army . It was the single most powerful institution in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and co-opt it to keep their hold on power . When this politicized army went into battle , it performed terribly . Huge casualties , uncoordinated supply for the troops , and gross misconduct were the order of the day . China lost one million men in the Korean War . The wars between India and Pakistan were comedies of errors . In the Arab-Israeli wars Israel was able to exploit Arab milRESHAPING // itary incompetence to win stunning victories , leading to Moshe Dayan 's famous answer to the question of why Israel was so successful in war . The secret , said Dayan , was to " fight Arabs . " The Iran-Iraq War could best be described as two uncontrolled mobs attacking each other , and the Iraqi army performed no better in the Gulf War . The only Asian army to hold its own against the West after World War II was the Vietnamese , against the United States . The Vietnamese were very tough and disciplined . Having stood up to China for centuries , they found the French and the Americans easy to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history that it assumed , quite incorrectly , that the Vietnamese would buckle to U.S. pressure . China is a good example of the giant Asian army and its limitations . Under Mao Zedong , it was a tool for political infighting . In the Great Leap Forward , Mao exploited the chaos that his own plan had produced by using the PLA to restore order on terms beneficial to himself . Then followed the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s ; with the PLA 's power on the rise , Mao set the radical Red Guards against the military to foreclose the possibility that they would act against him . Under Mao , the Chinese army was more of an internal political force than a professional body concerned with fighting the United States or the Soviet Union . Its disposition showed this . It was organized into thousands of small cells spread around the countryside and grouped into giant field armies . These armies almost never exercised as a whole because coordination was too hard , and because communication between units was so severely limited . The general staff , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take in the harvest and to build railroads . These things it could do . But it lacked the infrastructure and training to fight a war against the Soviet Union or to serve as a flexible instrument of foreign policy . In Mao 's China , highways were never built , telephone circuits were never laid , and railroad lines ran not to the borders for offensive // attack , but to the interior for protection from invasion . As a result , Chinese military strategy was extremely crude , largely consisting of the mass wave attacks used against America in the Korean War . The Chinese army was a military dinosaur . It could not coordinate large bodies of men . Its geographical reach was limited by how far the infantry could walk over harsh terrain . This is not to suggest that simple strategies could not be effective . In the Korean War this army walked to North Korea , where it dealt the United States a stunning blow . The Vietnamese army was equally primitive , but it , too , beat the United States . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most other Asian countries was always limited because there was so little technology and infrastructure to build on . Most often , innovation consisted of reorganizing the army into subunits of different sizes or specialized functions . For example , China kept large field formations , while Vietnam split its force into a regular army and a guerrilla force , the Viet Cong . In North Korea the army was split between a regular infantry and commando units trained for sabotage . Such innovations were useful , but they all relied on using mass in different ways to beat the enemy . Asian nation-states now are more established . There is no danger of a return to colonialism , and the danger of civil war has declined since the early days of statehood , when it was anyone 's guess who would rule the country . As a result , the political process has matured in South Korea , China , and India . In other countries such as Indonesia , North Korea , Pakistan , and Iraq , political maturity is still in the future . Nonetheless , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has diminished . The politicized army has gone too far in its business ventures , creating serious problems of economic instability . In China and Indonesia military enterprises strangle the national economy . In Pakistan the army 's internal blood feuds have carried over into foreign adventures in Kashmir and Afghanistan that have brought that country to the brink of chaos . // The problem throughout Asia now is how to get the army out of politics and the economy . A new kind of military is needed : one that is outward- rather than inward-looking ; one that is professionally rather than politically adept ; and one that is flexible rather than rigid . Asian armies need to be downsized and replaced with modern forces . Reaping little benefit from its massive force , China has been cutting the military back from a peak size of 5 million in 1980 to some 2.5 million today . Other countries would like to change to a more modern force , leaving behind the massive peasant infantry divisions of the postcolonial era . But politics and size make this hard to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow to reform , especially when they are run by influential generals who are resistant to any reduction of their authority . The military clings to its role , and it is very difficult for civilian leaders even to penetrate military organizations , much less turn them into flexible instruments of foreign policy . The record on reform is long on need and short on results . Increasing money for new equipment as a way to engineer change is the dream of every Asian general . But the generals ' dreams do not include the new weapons of mass destruction and missiles . Rather , they would buy thousands of artillery pieces , trucks , and tanks . They dream , in essence , of reproducing themselves as a better-equipped version of what they were twenty-five years ago . Yet showering money on the army in this way would have little impact on their modernization . Inefficiency , corruption , and bureaucratic intransigence would so distort such an expensive program that in the end it would probably only line the pockets of the generals who oversaw it . Spending more money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India would hardly be more secure with one million men added to their armies , even if they had more howitzers with which to arm them . Such a force would be not only irrelevant to the foreign policy universe these countries now live in but finan78 FIRE IN THE EAST cially ruinous to the government . However , spending money on programs that actually extend the international influence and reach of political leaders is a different matter . The problem is how to do it . Remodeling the Asian military around weapons of mass destruction , missiles , and other disruptive technologies offers leaders a way to get their hooks into these organizations . Disruptive technologies provide a new framework on which to build a military for the twenty-first century . Civilian leaders can bypass the bloated military bureaucracy by using a new avenue for civilian control over the military : working through special units created to acquire these systems outside of traditional military command lines . The new organizations ? the atomic energy commission , biological warfare research units , missile construction groups ? are populated by technocrats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditional army , the key institution in the postcolonial era , is being displaced by technocratic enterprises that are more responsive to civilian rulers ' ambitions ? both good and evil . These new groups enable strategy innovations . beyond the crude infantry tactics of the past . They free rulers from the strategic limitations of giant land-based armies . The new capabilities do not just change the old military balance , although they certainly do this . They do much more , becoming game changers for those who understand the new strategies they open up . Saddam Hussein , and others like him , now have the opportunity to give tangible expression to their evil delusions . The East , despite a tradition of profound strategic and philosophical thinking going back to the writings of Sun-tzu , has been manifestly incapable of asserting itself militarily . Missiles and weapons of mass destruction end this condition . They provide a technology platform for new strategies that tap a much richer philosophical tradition than that of the narrow-minded infantry generals of the postcolonial era. // EYES IN THE SKIES , AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more diverse sources of intelligence to the Asian military decision-making system . Satellites , fiber-optic communication lines , computer networks , and cellular telephones disgorge information that will transform civil-military relations in Asia . The new information technologies allow a quantum jump in performance for key parts of the armed forces . For other parts , they make little difference . Missile forces especially can be made highly effective and insulated from the inefficiencies that pervade other parts of the military . This goes unnoticed in most Western accounts , which usually focus on particularly glaring examples of backwardness and take them as emblematic of overall performance . In some areas , like jet aircraft or mechanized ground warfare , the Asian military is extremely backward compared to America or Europe . However , this assessment overlooks the role of new information technologies in making missile strikes and other tactics highly effective . The anatomy of the Asian military , viewed as an informationprocessing unit , is quite different than when looked at as a mass army consumed with politics . Most observers still look at the Asian military as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budgets and preserving its privileged place in society , however crippled by internal rivalries and political divisions . But looking at Asian military forces as information-processing systems , the question is whether different parts of the military can smoothly work together . To the extent that information technologies can make this occur , new strategies become possible . The issue for each Asian nation is no longer whether General X has allies on the general staff , but whether there is a warning system that can collect information about the state of enemy missiles in enough time to fire its own . Areas of military competence are emerging , still partially obscured by
