<p> Picture a slurry , made of wood fiber and fillers like calcium carbonate or clay , swimming in a sea of water so vast that the pulp can not form clumps . Mentally deposit it onto a wire mesh belt , through which the water drains out at huge pressures and speed . Feed that belt through a roller press to squeeze the rest of the moisture out . <p> Now put your mind 's eye into fast forward , and feed the slurry through the process at 4,000 feet a minute . <p> That is how fast a modern machine can make copier paper . The speed is both a blessing and a curse . The slightest variation in filler-to-fiber ratio , in the ionic charge on the filler or in the moisture content of the mixture can cause the machine to vibrate , pockmarking the paper with seemingly imperceptible hills and valleys that can jam a copier . <p> And that is if the paper gets that far . Vibration and an imbalanced formula can cause the paper to rupture on the production line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be redone . <p> Such paper breaks have cost the International Paper Company $100 million a year . But now , thanks to computerized controls and information technology , they may soon be history . <p> There is a paradox here . With $20.1 billion in sales last year , International Paper is the biggest player in an industry that visionaries long ago predicted would be a dinosaur in a paperless society . Well , not only have paper sales grown steadily , but International Paper has become a power user of the technologies that were supposed to render it obsolete . <p> At a paper plant in Selma , Ala. , it has installed ultrasensitive controls that early on can detect the slightest chemical imbalance or machine vibration and feed the data to computers . Operators in the control room can double click for a pull-down menu of options  --  tinker with the slurry formula , perhaps , or the speed of the machine  --  to prevent anything dire from taking place . <p> " There are 200 variables that can cause a problem , and even the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Richard B. Phillips , head of International Paper 's manufacturing technology center . He notes that the enhanced controls also let International Paper use more filler in its slurry , saving $50 million a year in materials costs . <p> Of course , most paper companies are taking a high-technology approach these days . They have to . Global papermaking capacity has soared , and most companies are already churning out fairly high-quality product at very low cost . Thus , the only way a paper company can distinguish itself is through customer service , and information systems are a prime way to provide it . <p> " This industry used to think , the smaller your information technology budget , the better off you were , " said L. Ronald Raines , Ernst &; Young 's paper expert . " Well , the I.T . budget in this industry routinely goes up 30 percent to 55 percent a year . " <p> The effects of that kind of spending are rampant throughout International Paper . Is a machine spewing forth low-quality paper ? The company will comb that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when everything was running smoothly and what they did wrong  --  say , let the paper slurry get top heavy in some chemicals  --  just before the problem hit . And it will put the answers into the electronic archives , so operators on similar machines can learn how to prevent foul-ups . <p> Is some remote machine malfunctioning in some mysterious way ? Trouble-shooters at the manufacturing technology headquarters in Loveland , Ohio , will set up video links with operators in the ailing mill , who can show them schematics of the process , real-time production data and anything else that can enable them to diagnose the problem . <p> International Paper is not just now discovering computers , of course . It developed the industry 's first computerized controls as a joint project with the International Business Machines Corporation nearly 40 years ago , and it has continually fine-tuned those controls to add speed to its machines and consistency to its products . It was also among the first to mechanize payrolls and other back-office operations . <p> But the scope of its information technology efforts has broadened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its first chief information officer , was a 38-year International Paper employee and finance specialist whose primary goal was running the information department as a low-cost operation aimed primarily at making scheduling and administrative operations more efficient . <p> Mr. Moore has since gone to Brussels for the company . Late last year , John T. Dillon , the company 's chairman and chief executive , hired J. Chris Scalet , the current information officer , away from Mapco Inc. , an energy company , and gave him responsibility for using computers to make money , not tons of product . <p> " John told me to use technology to create a competitive advantage , to differentiate us in the marketplace , " Mr. Scalet said . " And that 's meant shifting our focus from reducing costs and administrative burdens to projects that have a real impact on the revenue side of the house . " <p> It is no easy task . It means disseminating real-time information to operators , salespeople and , increasingly , customers . It means letting customers buy a myriad of products with one call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . It means giving salespeople in the field electronic access to every byte of information on orders , paper specifications , production schedules or stocks in hand . And increasingly it means adopting fancy security checks and systems , and then letting big customers tap into that data themselves . <p> But before facts and figures can be widely distributed , they have to be gathered and codified . Right now , hundreds of International Paper 's computer technologists are working on systems to insure that every plant uses the same customer and supplier numbers and maintains common cost data . They are setting up wide area networks so that the product specifications , production volumes and other information that is electronically captured from all of the company 's far-flung papermaking machines can be simultaneously disseminated to accounting , order entry and other departments . <p> International Paper is combing the software world for programs it can use to monitor every step in the papermaking process , from the time the logs come into the yard to the time the product shows up at the customer 's door  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . <p> For example , Tropicana , one of International Paper 's big packaging customers , occasionally complains that some of its orange juice cartons burst as they were being trucked to food stores . In response , International Paper electronically bugs a juice-filled truck , collects a continuous stream of data about temperatures , vibrations and other variables as the truck follows its normal route , and analyzes the data to see if the juice package needs strengthening or if trucks just need to be routed around pothole-strewn roads . <p> " We 're working to the point that if a customer has a complaint , we will be able to track the defective piece of paper or package back through every step it has gone through and spot exactly what went wrong , " said William E. Richardson , manager of process control technology . <p> Paper industry experts say that most large paper companies are chasing the same goals . <p> " Customers do n't just want products anymore , they want information , " said Ole Fadum , who runs a paper industry consulting firm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They want to know what their suppliers have in stock ; what they are scheduled to make ; what the product 's exact specifications are . " <p> Providing all that is a herculean task for any paper company . But the information technology steamroller has had to flatten particularly spiky obstacles at International Paper . <p> Because it was one of the first paper companies to develop extensive in-house computer systems , it is stuck with some of the most cumbersome " legacy " systems around . As are many of its industry brethren , it is buying huge materials-tracking and financial systems offered by software giants like SAP , I2 Technologies and Manugistics , but it is having a much harder time melding them with its existing systems than companies that came later to information technology . <p> There are other logistical glitches . The company has been on a buying binge , acquiring 17 companies in the last five years alone , and thus is faced with integrating their disparate information systems into its own . It has also been consolidating plants and offices . As a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N.Y. , Mr. Phillips 's manufacturing technology group , which serves as first port of call for the mills and product development departments , is in Ohio . Mr. Scalet 's information technology group , which handles financial reporting , installing SAP programs , the year 2000 conversion and customer links , is in Memphis . <p> The two technology groups meet quarterly , and the manufacturing folks transmit streams of data to Memphis each day , but there is little chance for ideas to spring from encounters at the water cooler . <p> That has not stopped Mr. Scalet from plunging into the manufacturing world . He has already assigned 250 of his people to paper mills or other International Paper departments , to see firsthand how their processes work and what kind of help they need in getting data to their customers . <p> He is investigating ways to sell product on the Internet . And he has jazzed up the company 's internal Web page . Now , mills can use it to swap surplus equipment , and employees can get access to work tips  --  from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wood chipper to the best way to run a company function . <p> He is also making it interactive . Each month , on the chairman 's home page , employees are asked , " If you were chairman what would you do ? " about a particular issue and are invited to send in their answers by E-mail . For now , senior executives respond off line . Down the road , the company plans to post samples of the employees ' comments on the Internet and install a respond button that will enable managers and colleagues to react to the suggestions . <p> Mindful of the need for symbols of change , just last month Mr. Scalet changed his group 's name from Information Systems to Information Technology . <p> " The Internet is n't a system ; a telephone is n't a system , " he said . " Systems can increase productivity and decrease costs . Technologies can bring in revenues . " <p> Chart/Diagram : " 21st-Century Papermaking " Making paper can be a difficult and sometimes inefficient process . To get its paper mills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , International Paper has installed computer systems to closely monitor each step in the papermaking process . CHIPPER  --  Logs are cut into wood chips . DIGESTER  --  The wood chips are " cooked " with chemicals to separate the wood fibers from the lignin that binds them together . Computers let plant operators reduce the amount of fuel and chemicals needed for this process  --  as well as monitor harmful emissions . BLOW TANK  --  The fibers are separated , forming a pulp . WASHER  --  Any remaining lignin and chemicals are removed . Some chemicals are recycled . BLEACHER  --  Computer-run sensors let operators fine-tune the amount of bleach to achieve the desired brightness in the pulp . Control is important for making sure the pulp is not overbleached , which weakens the fibers and makes them unusable . RECYCLED PAPER  --  Some mills are now extending their virgin pulp mix with recycled paper pulp . Because recycled pulp generally has shorter , weaker fiber , it is harder to work with and requires a different amount of water and drying time . The necessary fine-tuning was not possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cut and brushed to improve its bonding properties and strength . THICKENER  --  Excess water is removed . FILLERS , SIZING AND DYES  --  By giving operators better control over the mixture of pulp and additives , computers let the mill use unusual additives , like ash fillers , that are less costly . HEAD BOX  --  The pulp is mixed with water before entering the presses . The mixture is about 99.5 percent water to 0.5 percent pulp . THE WIRE  --  The water-pulp mixture goes onto a screened conveyor belt moving up to 4,000 feet a minute . The pulp forms into paper as water drains through the screen . High-speed cameras monitor the conveyor to watch for variations in consistency that can cause the paper to break and shut down the presses . PRESSES  --  Computer control of the " wet " part of the manufacturing process has enabled the mills to cut down on their water usage . DRYERS  --  Steam-heated cylinders remove all but 5 percent of the water . Computers monitor the temperature to make sure the paper is dried enough without being damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shine of the paper .
