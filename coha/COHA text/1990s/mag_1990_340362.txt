The local Pooh-Bahs of Washington share a consensus in favor of statehood for the capital . Congressional Democrats nominally support creation of " New Columbia , " which would have two seats in the Senate and one in the House , all certain to be filled by Democrats . But Republican opposition and the district 's propensity for comic-opera government keep statehood low on the agenda . <P> Congressman Ralph Regula of Ohio recently proposed an alternative : returning the city to Maryland , which donated the land 199 years ago . That idea got scant attention until Governor William Donald Schaefer surprised everyone by saying he would accept " retrocession . " But black leaders such as Jesse Jackson have denounced the proposal , Schaefer has backed away , and congressional insiders say forget it . Thus , Washington is likely to remain what statehooders call the last colony for the foreseeable future .
