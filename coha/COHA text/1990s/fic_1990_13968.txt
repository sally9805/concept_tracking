RUBIN In my own humble fashion . WILL Rubin , humble ? That 's news . RUBIN ( Brief pause . ) I may move my desk away from the window . The view 's distracting . WILL ( Peering out of the window . ) It 's breathtaking  --  the entire lake . PETRA ( Patting Rubin 's back . ) My Rubin , master of all he surveys . WILL Quite a lot , by the look of it . RUBIN Many many hundreds of acres , yes . PETRA Some bookshelves there , I think . I know you like it bare , darling . That 's his new thing , simplicity . A Persian rug , though  --  to cushion the noise . Rubin hates noise  --  birds breathing , insects changing their mind . RUBIN If you should stumble across something irresistible  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PETRA ( To Will . ) This is Rubin 's domain . He wo n't be invaded . RUBIN She has the rest of the house . PETRA ( To Will . ) You see our picture of life in the country ; wife below , apron over cocktail gown , Jane Austin putting up elderberry jam  --  critic above in immaculate silence , Edmund Wilson with Russian dictionary , combing The Brothers Karamazov for jokes . WILL It 's magnificent . The whole setting . The house . A lovely restoration , I 'm impressed . PETRA How gracious and correct and vague of you . WILL All right , my honest opinion  --  RUBIN Words after which only fools pay heed . WILL Suddenly I feel on trial . Help , how should I be ; fulsome , discerning , extravagant ? PETRA Anything you like , except ALL ( Laughing . ) Ordinary ! WILL " Anything but ordinary , " How could I forget , Rubin 's golden rule ! RUBIN You did n't forget . And it still applies , when in Rome . p. 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an envious friend and jaded urbanite  --  it 's a perfect combination of Petra 's elegant taste and Rubin 's passion for order and perfection .

This way down ( PETRA makes a comical turn to go . ) WILL ( Listening . ) It 's incredibly quiet , is n't it ? After the city . Isolated . Quiet .

They 're just down the road . PETRA A mere seven miles . RUBIN You do n't give them a chance . They 're good folks . PETRA If you enjoy tapioca pudding and a friendly chat about bowel movements .

Will is a literary personage now . He 's above that sort of thing . RUBIN Is she right , Will ? Have we transcended the carnal ? WILL As a matter of fact , I 'm seeing someone . RUBIN You 're seeing two of us , are n't you ? Ah . Seeing ! PETRA We know about the Contessa . I imagine most of the nation knows by now . WILL News travels . PETRA She is rather notorious , Will .

Speaking of which , food anyone ? I 'm ravenous . RUBIN ( Smiles . ) How sickening . Is n't success supposed to take its toll ? Yet here he is , smug , sleek and self-satisfied ; an affront to every middlebrow cliche of sin and retribution . WILL ( Mock drama . ) I 'm looking desperately for something to shatter my happiness , help me , please . RUBIN The host strives to satisfy . PETRA Last call for lunch . RUBIN By all means . Eat , relax . We 'll do some real catching up later . WILL It 's so damn quiet . PETRA You get used to it . We have . Shall we ?

( Pause . ) Were you going to ? Are the spookies upon us ? WILL You 're bored , are n't you . PETRA ( Seeming not to have heard . ) We 've become terribly Rod and Gun since the move . I 'm for dark slippery things gliding under water in silence . Rubin is more your noisy-slaughter type , bang-bang . He shoots for hours on end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a stretch for a wealthy intellectual ex-literary critic , but never mind , he does n't fool himself , and that 's what matters ( Stops . ) You 're awfully quiet , Will . p. 10 WILL You 're awfully chattery .

( SHE applies insect repellant to chest , aware of WILL 's glances . ) PETRA This could be one of your stories  --  Two people row across a lake and fish . Her husband may or may not be watching from the other shore .

PETRA When you answered the phone I had to literally catch my breath I was so ( Applies lotion behind Will 's neck . ) Do n't turn , I love the back of your head . You do indecent things to me still , Will . Are you still my Will ? Is my Willy still mine ? WILL Stop , he can see . PETRA Not what we 're thinking . Are your thoughts lascivious ? Mine are . They 're teeming with damp underwatery things . WILL ( Smiles . ) Behave . PETRA I intend to ; appallingly . Stay the night .

WILL If I stay , we play by the rules . PETRA Rules ? Are they different up here ? As opposed to the city , when I pop down for antiques and fabric ? And a roll in the hay ? No , that 's not right , hay is n't the city . A lark in the loft ? A coupling in the condo ? ( PETRA returns to her rod. ) p. 12 WILL He must n't ever know about us , Petra . PETRA I wo n't tell . WILL If we start again , we have to be very careful . PETRA Did we stop ? WILL It 's been a year almost . PETRA Ten months and fourteen days , but who 's counting .

Who demands nothing . PETRA A ringing endorsement ! WILL She 's a good-hearted , ordinary , down-to-earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's a glitter tramp , a moronic little bubble-head who has it off with anything that does n't move with its belly on the ground . Even in my own spectacularly brief career on celluloid I met half a dozen men who 'd orgied with the Contessa  --  she 's legendary for groups at a time , and rather casual about species , rumor has it . ( SHE casts . ) WILL I 'm sorry you feel that way . PETRA I 'd hate to see you get hurt . WILL I 'm a big boy , Petra . PETRA Precisely . Will , I do understand . I 'm pleased by your success  --  and bravo , you did it without the High-Lit crowd , jumped right over their beards and dandruff into the hearts of the hoi-polloi with a juicy scandal . It 's amusing , yes . Except this book was a freak  --  you are n't mainstream . When the fuss dies down , you 've a long career ahead and you 're at the mercy of people with long memories and savage minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even once . p. 14 WILL I take it you did n't like the book . PETRA I could n't finish it , sorry . WILL That bad ? PETRA The Contessa 's crowd is n't your turf . You do average messy people blundering toward the daylight . WILL Shall I keep writing my first three books over and over , is that what you 'd like ? PETRA Will , what 's the matter ?

PETRA In the woods , come WILL Tonight , tonight PETRA Tonight , then . In your room . Behind the house . On the dock .

WILL Sorry , Rubin , I wo n't bite . RUBIN It 's a simple fact . WILL I know your simple facts ; the outrageous statement , a pause while the bait is taken , then the smug grin ' cause you hooked another fool . RUBIN ' Cause ? WILL Because . RUBIN Would you let them camp in your living room ? Eat from your fridge ? Slip between your warm sheets ? If I let them take advantage , they 'll never respect me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else do we teach good conduct ? WILL You own hundreds of acres , Rubin , they 're not in the way . ( HE sees RUBIN smiling . ) Damn it ! I 'll have to be on my toes around you . RUBIN Imagine , me shooting at another human being . Mild mannered Rubin . WILL This from the man who cooked and ate the school swan ? ! RUBIN Strictly in the spirit of rational enquiry . I 'm now one of the few people alive who knows why restaurants do n't serve meat-of-swan . Inquisitive , that 's me . And , I repeat , mild mannered , reasonable and kind to all living creatures . p. 18 WILL Save a few writers I could name . RUBIN But not you . You I always treated well . WILL I 'm deeply in your debt . RUBIN Do n't be touchy . Genius compels praise . WILL ( Smiling . ) Fuck off . RUBIN ( Raising glass . ) To friendship  --  restored . WILL ( Likewise . ) Was it lost ? RUBIN I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have noticed . I could hardly champion the work of an intimate friend without raising eyebrows . WILL How do you do that ? Separate emotions ; put career ahead of feelings ? RUBIN Do n't you ? WILL Never . RUBIN Ah , well , you 're an artist . Unfathomable . WILL Rubin , cut the shit . ( Enter PETRA from the house as the two MEN clink glasses . SHE is slightly flushed as SHE stops and cocks an ear . ) PETRA The gypsies , they 've arrived . ( Moving sinuously to the music . ) We dance right out here on the dock every summer , Rubin and I , do n't we , darling ? p. 19 RUBIN Maybe later . PETRA Will , then . ( To Rubin . ) Do you mind ? RUBIN ( Smiles . ) Could I ever refuse you a thing ? PETRA ( Moving in rhythm . ) Rubin is so good to me . ( WILL , with reluctance , sets down his glass to receive Petra , but SHE suddenly moves off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PETRA Look , the fish are coming up ! ( SHE greets them with small kissing sounds . ) It 's amazing . We set foot on the dock and all across the lake they seem to know . Vibrations , is that it ? Imagine if people felt each other that way , all over and inside . You 'd go mad in the city . Where 's the bread , I 'll feed them , did you tell the story ? ( PETRA seems excited , nervous , happy . Through the following , SHE locates a bag of bread crumbs and feeds the fish . ) RUBIN I was waiting for you . PETRA But I 've heard it . How incredible that it never got around . RUBIN Who 'd tell ? Not me . Certainly not Shumkin . WILL Shumkin ? Stately , plump Mitchell Shumkin ? ( THEY enjoy the shared joke. ) p. 20 PETRA ( Giggling . ) And cross-eyed , did you ever notice ? WILL You 're right , they go in towards his nose . Stately , plump ALL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuck . RUBIN Poor ? He crucified your book . Not to mention all the ones before . PETRA Oh , tell him , Rubin , it 's so perfect RUBIN Well . After your second novel  --  I mean , it was obscene all these years , how he 'd find out-of-the-way anthologies with a story by you just to launch an attack PETRA He 's slime , total slime WILL Can you really blame him for hating us ? Even back in college , remember what a pompous creep he was , pretending to be a loner by choice ? RUBIN Are you saying his reviews never hurt ? Even a little ? WILL A bitter , self-important drudge on a minorish paper . I always pitied him . PETRA He 's foul . The way he pushes that awful belly at you and pontificates . RUBIN But does n't it hurt all the same , even the scorn of an idiot ? p. 21 WILL Some people have to pay the rent . RUBIN I know all that , Saint William . Look , I 'm out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt people , very very badly . I even got a kick out of twisting hot words in the wounds I made , but I drew the line . Shumkin was out-and-out murderous , far beyond the bounds of ordinary critical venom . WILL Fine , so it hurt , so what ? RUBIN Good . That 's important , Will . Pain is real . And when hurt , revenge is an honorable act-ask the gypsies . PETRA Just tell the story . RUBIN I invited him out to dinner . WILL You ate with Shumkin ? That squint ? Those chewed fingernails ? Why ? RUBIN Exactly what he wondered  --  I could see the sweat as he sat down . After all , attack you and he attacks my judgement , too  --  as well he knows PETRA Just tell the story , Christ , it 's enough to drive you batty , all his digressions ( Stops . ) RUBIN ( Pause . ) Fix yourself another drink , darling . PETRA Get on with it , is all I 'm saying . You did this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pause . ) Sorry . p. 22 RUBIN He sat there twiddling his wine glass while I made small talk  --  quite deliberately  --  just to watch him squirm , avoid my eyes , wondering when lightning would strike , I 'm coming to it , Petra , I have to set the scene . PETRA You 're doing wonderfully , dear , the scene is vivid . RUBIN Thank you . Finally , in my most off-hand voice , I asked did he honestly think your work was so what was his phrase ? " Shallow effect and glib technique , empty below the surface . " WILL I remember that . RUBIN Do n't we always , the words that wound ? WILL What did he say ? RUBIN Much clearing of phlegm and vague harrumphing , you know how he does , then  --  Noise . Words . Babble . WILL Such as PETRA Wait ! RUBIN The words do n't matter . It was his face , the look on his face at the exact moment he felt the warmth on his trouser leg , the clinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew , he knew and the expression of pain , the hurt child in his eyes just for a second ; then of course , up he shot , beet red , speechless for no doubt the first time in his life , and waddled into the night like a wounded sea lion . p. 23 PETRA He peed on Mitchell Shumkin ! Under the table , my darling Rubin peed on him ! WILL Bullshit . RUBIN Someone had to do it . Men like Shumkin were born to be peed on . And deeply satisfying it was , on any number of levels . Far more than anything I 've written . WILL A fine story , Rubin . I 'm sure it 'll enhance your growing legend . Of course I do n't believe a word of it . You 've done many a crazy thing , but that ? I do n't see it . RUBIN No one saw . It was under the table . Below the surface where , presumably , your work does n't reach . You see the poetry of my gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PETRA I tried to call you when I heard . Rubin stopped me . He was embarrassed after the fact . RUBIN No , darling . It was between me and Shumkin  --  a sacred moment . How often do two people know so exactly what they feel towards one another beyond where words can reach . ( A pause . ) WILL ( Suddenly , WILL laughs with enormous relish . ) That 's amazing . You actually  --  in a restaurant pulled out The Mighty Quinn and piddled on Shumkin ? p. 24 PETRA ( Happy , excited , in a single rush of breath . ) You see , he 's delighted  --  ( To Will . ) I told him  --  ( To Rubin . ) There was no reason to keep it a secret all these years  --  ( To Will . ) He never listens  --  ( To Rubin . ) You should trust my instincts , darling , I know about these things , between people is what I 'm good at ( PETRA notes THEIR eyes on her and stops speaking abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'd like more than anything in the world ? WILL ( Pause . ) What ? RUBIN Another drink . PETRA ( Perking up . ) In that case , why do n't I just slip inside and fix you one . RUBIN You do n't mind ? PETRA If you desire a private moment with Will . If I 'm to be the topic of conversation . If either or both of the above apply , then no , of course I do n't mind . RUBIN ( Pause . ) I 'll get it . PETRA Absolutely not . Would n't dream of it . ( To Will . ) Another ? p. 25 WILL ( Elsewhere . ) Sorry ? ( Then . ) No  --  no thanks . Well PETRA A pause . The lake grows still . He thinks WILL ( Smiles . ) Maybe a small one . Half . PETRA The prudent choice . A cautious man . WILL ( Extends his glass . ) Fill her up . PETRA ( Takes glass . ) You have no idea how happy I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life are so clear ; pouring , mixing , stirring ( PETRA spots the bag of bread in her hand . For a moment it seems to puzzle her , then SHE hands it to Will . ) For you . Small pieces . ( SHE exits inside . ) ( WILL starts feeding the fish . A silence . ) RUBIN What do you make of her ? WILL ( Beat . ) Petra ? RUBIN Do you notice anything , does anything strike you ? WILL ( Shrugs . ) She 's a striking woman . RUBIN Her behavior ? p. 26 WILL You 're being inscrutable , Rubin . RUBIN I need ( Stops . ) I need your help . WILL How ? RUBIN ( With difficulty . ) Since school our connection is that the right word ?  --  it 's paradoxical . The very thing that draws us together pulls us apart . WILL Who ? RUBIN I mean our work . WILL Ah . That . RUBIN And still , for some reason there 's no one on earth I feel closer to  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange to you ? WILL A little . We 've drifted into such different puddles over the years . RUBIN That 's a nice image . Did you just think of it ? WILL I can never tell when you 're busting my balls . RUBIN Yes , Petra says I tend to make people uneasy . But I always thought you saw through my manner . That you did n't find me intimidating . WILL ( Facing him . ) You do n't intimidate me . RUBIN Good . Because I 'd like very much to bridge the gap  --  get past the way we usually talk . Would that be awkward ? p. 27 WILL ( Pause . ) I do n't see why . RUBIN ( Watching him . ) You 're one of the very few people I 've always admired enormously . As a writer and a man . Your honesty . Your integrity WILL Rubin , I am human . RUBIN But for me , you see , you 're more than that . You represent the very best of rare qualities . WILL ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your judgement . Your support . Even when no one else stood behind me . RUBIN Is n't this a terrific feeling ? Excuse the expression  --  open books . WILL What did you want ? RUBIN Petra 's slipping away from me . WILL How so ? RUBIN She 's restless . Distracted . Her mind is elsewhere . WILL She 's high strung . A little wild . She always was . Remember what you told me when you met her ? " I think I 've finally found someone as crazy as myself . " RUBIN You put that in a story . WILL Beware the writer . We steal from everywhere . p. 28 RUBIN I had hopes that a peaceful environment , a project  --  the house here . Maybe start a family . I had to do something . WILL About what ?

WILL I 'm reasonably sure you need n't worry . RUBIN I 'm inclined to put a great deal of weight on what you say . WILL Rubin , do n't . Please . She 's your wife . RUBIN True . The situation does n't really involve you . WILL ( Pause . ) Do you think she 's seeing someone ? p. 29 RUBIN If that were the case I should n't feel I was losing her . Only that I was sharing her . WILL There 's a difference ? RUBIN Oh , day and night . WILL ( Pause . ) Someone might be stealing her affections , you mean ? RUBIN Stealing , yes . The perfect word . I could n't survive without Petra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RUBIN I have nothing else . WILL Hundreds of acres , a bountiful family trust , the admiration of your peers ? RUBIN I 'm rich , and a critic , that 's all . A man who knows from two directions what it means to be useless . No . Petra 's what I have . Petra 's what I wo n't give up . WILL You wo n't have to , I 'm sure . RUBIN You 'll talk to her ? Draw her out ? After dinner , go for a walk , ask what 's on her mind , how she 's feeling , that kind of thing WILL ( Deciding . ) I have to catch the evening train . RUBIN Petra thinks you 're here for the night . p. 30 WILL ( Awkwardly . ) It 's best I move along .

Very reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , then notes the situation . ) Have you finished discussing me ? RUBIN Do n't I recall something about drinks ? PETRA Drinks ! What was I thinking !

( Exits with a smile . ) RUBIN ( Beat . ) Please stay . WILL If only I could . RUBIN She wo n't let me touch her . She has this terror of losing another baby . WILL Baby ? I had no idea . RUBIN She thinks I blame her . I ca n't make her see that she 's all I need . WILL ( Brief pause . ) I 'm so sorry . That 's awful p. 31 RUBIN Will you stay ?

RUBIN Do n't make me beg . I 'm desperate . WILL I 'll stay the night . If you really think it can make a difference . RUBIN It can change everything . Or I would n't ask .

Please , I need room to breathe . RUBIN ( Taking one step backward . ) Is that far enough ? Shall I step outside ? Across the lake ? Tell me when you have enough room , darling . PETRA This is a bad day to get complicated . RUBIN Do you love me ? PETRA Rubin , please . Why do you ask when you wo n't believe what I tell you ? I 'm going to leave one day . You 'll make up in an empty bed and find a note on the kitchen table , " Dear Rubin , I 'm as faithless and treacherous as you always knew , good-bye , Petra . " Is that better ? RUBIN Do you love me ? It 's a simple enough question . PETRA Nothing you ask is simple , Rubin . Try to work . Ignore me . ( PETRA resumes her posture . ) RUBIN What about dinner ? PETRA What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's food in the fridge . I thought we 'd make it a wander-by-and-graze sort of thing . Will seems easy . p. 36 RUBIN I 'll cook . PETRA There . Problem solved . You 'll feel better , darling . There 's nothing like an activity to take one 's mind off the moment . I 'll help if you like . RUBIN I can manage . PETRA I know you can , darling . I love that about you . One thing less to worry about . One thing more to count on . RUBIN There 's nothing on earth I 'd deny you . But I have to know . You must tell me everything . PETRA You do n't ask much . RUBIN I have little else to hold onto right now . PETRA Well , who chose to stop work , to leave the city , to sit all day by the edge of a lake all day waiting for God-knows-what ? Not me . My choice was to be with you in whatever-it-is , " sickness and health ; " Lord , what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there you are , I 'm an old fashioned gal , and nothing , Rubin , nothing will alter my promise , no matter how much you strip away to test my love . Turn frog and still the princess will perch beside you on our lily pad till the end of time RUBIN Shut up , Petra . Just shut up . PETRA Ask a simple question . p. 37 RUBIN I 'll start dinner . PETRA I 'm much less complicated than you think , darling . If only you did n't have such a busy , devious mind . If you did n't think we were all like you . If you knew how to be wrong ( Smiling , PETRA puts her hand on Rubin 's cheek tenderly . ) This will pass , Rubin . It will pass . ( The LIGHT fades ) p. 38 Act 1 , Scene 5 Scene 5 SCENE : LIVING ROOM AT RISE : RUBIN enters with logs , followed by WILL in mid-story , wearing a chic white shirt . PETRA , last on stage , goes to side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three glasses of cognac while RUBIN prepares a fire . WILL For instance , this silk shirt . She likes to buy me things . Impulsive . Like a child , really . PETRA How adorable . WILL Anyway , when I brought her round to meet our crowd she called them " shabby , stuck-up inside types . " Meaning , I realized later , in doors . They do n't get outside much . At least I think that 's what she meant . She never explains . So , in the end , we chose her friends . They 're very accepting . Well , I was a novelty , I guess , but we all got along . And out popped a book . RUBIN Popped ? PETRA Corks , darling , you know . WILL Five weeks , start to finish . RUBIN How unlike you . PETRA After years of squeezing , pop ! A gratuity from the muse . WILL And , alas , you were n't there to share my triumph . p. 39 PETRA ( Raises glass . ) To Will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) To cognac . To a log fire . To this room , to the lake , to friends , to a fine meal to this feeling , this , right now . For which I have Rubin to thank . RUBIN Me ? WILL Green Mountain was childish . You 're right , I was afraid of being overwhelmed by fond memories nostalgia the point being PETRA We understand , Will . Do n't we , darling . RUBIN He 's not finished . The point ? WILL I 'm glad you called my bluff . PETRA A small sin . We forgive you . WILL It might have stood in the way of a moment like this PETRA ( Stopping him . ) Thank you for a touching toast . RUBIN Was it a toast , or a confession ? PETRA A touching whatever-it-was . RUBIN The lake is getting to him . PETRA Do n't start , darling . p. 40 RUBIN It 's true . Being close to nature makes you want to simplify , cleanse , purge the spirit . It puts you in touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it rains we get wet . RUBIN Petra 's a skeptic . She ca n't let go of the city . PETRA Why should I ? Rooms full of people bring out the best in me . In the woods my qualities feel inappropriate . Context is everything , do n't you agree , Will ? RUBIN We interrupted his confession , darling ; toast , sorry . Say on , Will , unburden WILL There is one more thing PETRA Have n't we heard enough about your darling Contessa ? Let 's move on to something neutral and safe and slightly unimportant . Books ! Have we read anything good lately ? WILL It 's about Rubin . I was asked to find out what he 's working on . RUBIN To spy ? Really ? WILL A small piece for the journal . " What 's so and so up to ? " kind-of-thing . RUBIN You agreed to commit an act of journalism ? Are we that desperate ? What next , the talk show , the endorsement of footwear , Amaretto di William ? p. 41 WILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , an embarrassing fee . I said no , of course . RUBIN Why of course ? WILL You hate publicity . RUBIN Do I ? PETRA You like to control your publicity . To create your own legend . RUBIN True . But he might have asked . WILL I thought I 'd spare you the awkwardness of saying no to a friend . RUBIN Imagine , writer interviewing critic , something new under the sun : Deer shoots hunter ! Boy bites dog ! PETRA ( Pours herself another drink . ) This is Rubin 's favorite posture ; false modesty . RUBIN Shun this woman . Her insight is ice in the heart . WILL I wanted you to know there 's still interest in your doings . RUBIN And that you 've remained loyal to my passion for secrecy . WILL Privacy . RUBIN Better . Privacy is better . Score one for Will . PETRA Is this a contest ? p. 42 RUBIN I 'd need a handicap . Will is telling me , dear , that his star is so high these days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write on just about any old subject , even poor me . WILL More false modesty ! ( To Petra . ) You 're right , he 's a monster of humility . RUBIN Why bring it up ? You refused his offer . It 's a non-event . PETRA He 's paying you a compliment . Your name lives on in song and legend , that 's his meaning , is n't it ? WILL Exactly . RUBIN Have I failed to sound his deeper motive ? WILL ( Nettled . ) I 'm not trying to score points , Rubin . Something troubled me . I told you in the spirit of a certain conversation a certain agreement  --  open books , if you recall . PETRA Agreement ? Did I miss something ? WILL Apparently not . PETRA Did Rubin speak his heart to you in private ? Beware , Will . That high rusty squeak you heard was the Gates of Hell swinging wide . ( Eyeing Rubin . ) RUBIN Then you were confessing that you might have come to sniff out a story . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this because even the possibility of a small treachery bothered you . p. 43 WILL ( Firm . ) Yes . RUBIN Your thoughtfulness bespeaks a truly delicate and scrupulous sensibility . PETRA I 'm cold , Rubin . Light the fire . RUBIN Tell Hays that I 'm working on nothing . I 've taken early retirement . And the rest , as Hays might say , showing his familiarity with Bartlett 's Quotations , is silence . PETRA May I have the matches ? WILL ( Ignores Petra . ) No one will believe that . I do n't . RUBIN A life of leisure ? I thought it was everyone 's dream . Is n't it yours ? WILL I could n't spend all day doing nothing . RUBIN You were n't trained from birth , unlike the people you just wrote about . We 're different , Will . WILL They 're hardly like you . RUBIN They 're exactly like me . Younger and sillier , that 's all . Know your subject before you write it . PETRA Let 's put on some music . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , darling . p. 44 WILL You , the demon of industry , you could spend the rest of your fife inactive ? RUBIN There 's maintenance  --  holding onto what 's yours . As you scale the ladder , you 'll see . People covet what you have . They want to take it away . PETRA ( Holds out matchbox . ) These are damp . RUBIN There 's more by the sink . PETRA Would you get them please ? RUBIN Petra does n't trust us alone . PETRA You seem to make alliances behind my back . RUBIN Will was speaking figuratively . No secrets among friends . He and I had a little chat . It does n't concern you . I 'll get the matches . WILL Rubin , make up your mind , do you want things in the open , or do you want to play games ? RUBIN What a strange question to come from you . WILL ( To Petra . ) He asked me to draw you out about the baby . He wants to know why you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and tell him . ( Pause . ) Now we have no secrets . PETRA ( Pause ; to Rubin . ) Is that true ? p. 45 RUBIN ( Beat . ) These are new rules . PETRA ( To Rubin . ) You had no right . WILL I thought he might have made it up . You never told me about the baby . RUBIN Why should she ? PETRA Yes , Will , why should I ? WILL ( Off balance . ) No reason . It was stupid of me . PETRA Very . But for the record , if you really must know  --  and there will be nothing more said about it  --  Rubin 's gone a little strange on the subject of nature . He wants us joined in a way that does n't seem to be possible , through no fault of his or mine . We tried . It did n't work . And he needs reasons , you see , he always needs to get to the bottom of things , even with a lake outside screaming riotously heavy-handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control , things inside me which I choose to keep in darkness . ( Recovers . ) Now light the fire and let 's tell funny stories about the people we know . ( WILL begins to exit . ) RUBIN Where are you going , Will ? WILL I feel in the way , here . p. 46 PETRA It 's over . Let 's enjoy what 's left of the evening . WILL I 've made things awkward . I 'm very sorry , Rubin . Petra . I 'm sorry . PETRA It 's hardly a tragedy . RUBIN Good night , Will . I accept your apology . ( WILL exits . ) PETRA That was inexcusable . RUBIN Which part ? PETRA Why did you want him here , Rubin ? What are you doing ? RUBIN I 've missed him . In a way you could say I missed so many many things . PETRA Do n't bring him into this . No allies , that 's cheating . Well handle this our own way . RUBIN That 's what I 'm doing . PETRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digging and probing and let things take their course . RUBIN ( Pause , then moves beside her . ) He 's very fond of you . PETRA Of us both . RUBIN ( Close to her . ) He thinks you 're striking . PETRA How do you know ? p. 47 RUBIN He told me . PETRA He 's a romantic . What else ? Tell me more . RUBIN He says you 're a little wild . PETRA Am I ? RUBIN He finds you very attractive , Petra . PETRA Do n't you ? RUBIN I think he 'd like to touch you . PETRA You think everyone would . RUBIN I see them watching . Dreaming of you . They 'd give anything to be as close as this . PETRA But who 's the lucky boy ? RUBIN ( Pause . ) I 'd like to go upstairs . Would you come ? PETRA ( Moving suddenly away . ) Why , Rubin ? Why must you ask ? RUBIN You have to want me . PETRA I ca n't do that . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . PETRA In that case we 'll have to wait . RUBIN How much longer ? PETRA I do n't know , Rubin . Till something happens to make me want you again that way . p. 48 RUBIN And meanwhile we ignore the abyss . No gestures , no looks , no words PETRA Words violate more than touching . I 'm sorry , darling . It 's not an easy time for you . But when you tip-toe ' round full of patience and concern , I feel repelled with you , with myself for being so cruel when I know what you need , what I ca n't bring myself to give right now Let me do this my own way , please . Trust that I mean well . RUBIN If there was only something I could do PETRA ( Smiles . ) Ignore me , the way you used to . When you were selfish and difficult and beautifully ambitious . RUBIN I did n't need you then . PETRA But , you see , I needed you . RUBIN ( Pause . ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll sleep with you , Rubin . If you tell me to . I 'll make believe . RUBIN Never pretend . Not with me . PETRA I 'm a good actress . I might fool you . RUBIN No . That could n't happen . Not any more . PETRA Are you very sure ? What if it 's the only power I have left ? What if our life together depended on it ? p. 49 RUBIN I 'll make a fire . If I fall asleep till breakfast . ( PETRA kisses him and goes up the stairs . SHE stops , turns back . RUBIN looks up . Pause . The LIGHTS snap Off. ) @x SCENE : THE GUEST ROOM AT RISE : WILL lies on top of the bed in a light sleep . A KNOCK . HE sits up . PETRA enters , sits beside him on the bed . WILL I did n't think you 'd come . PETRA What , and miss the best part ? WILL Did I make a fool of myself ? PETRA Babbling every sin but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Even now . PETRA And vice versa . WILL I make him nervous ? That 's hard to believe . PETRA It 's an article of faith with Rubin that brilliance should be visible . Your lack of show puzzles him ; that he ca n't see the part of you that writes . WILL I wish he 'd stop trying . PETRA Do you ? WILL The Contessa knew enough to ignore my work . PETRA And she was rewarded with a book worthy of her indifference ? WILL Thank you . PETRA I 'm teasing , darling . p. 51 WILL ( Beat . ) This was meant to be a simple day . PETRA Lunch , sex and au revoir ? WILL You forgot the cigarette . PETRA ( Smiling . ) That 's better . ( PETRA massages his temples . ) WILL This is what I miss . The way you touch me . PETRA Shhh . Let me play with my Will . My lovely Will . My puppy . WILL Puppy ? PETRA Forgive me , what would you like to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , sometimes , a little . PETRA I do n't need you for that . WILL When you have Rubin . PETRA You have the Contessa . Are n't you the moody , brilliant man in her life ? WILL That 's over . PETRA I know . Or I would n't be here . WILL When I was with her , I used to think of you . PETRA Nervous chit-chat ? Is that how we 're handling the transition ? p. 52 WILL Transition ? PETRA To now . From before . To the deed itself . Why is it such a hard line to cross when we both know what happens next , when we 've waited so long , when nothing more stands between us ? ( PETRA moves her legs astraddle his body , facing him . ) WILL Should n't we go  --  somewhere ? PETRA When you 're trembling all over . When I can Peter Cottontail under my leg , hippity-hop . When I can smell your skin Why is the next step so difficult ? WILL Christ , Petra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? PETRA Will , my Will , here I am , step across . WILL I keep picturing him with his eyes open , listeningwatching the stairs . PETRA You 're giving him power . You need n't , we 're alone now . WILL ( Rising from bed . ) You 're the one who gives him power . You let him keep you here . PETRA Shh , my darling ; dangerous waters . WILL ( Pacing . ) You were half the secret of his spell ; entertaining , beguiling his colleagues . He was admired for his brilliant mind , but he was envied for his wife , and he had no right to take a life away that was half yours . p. 53 PETRA ( Playful , teasing . ) Enough , Will . Time to play . Undress me ; slowly . ( Arms out . ) Make me tingle . WILL ( Suddenly . ) Come to the city with me . Tonight . PETRA Ca n't we make love first and save the rest for pillow talk ? WILL I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a day in the country PETRA A roll in the hay ? WILL If it happened . I did n't count on it . PETRA How sweet . All this way for lunch . Is my quiche that exciting ? WILL All right , I did count on it . I had to see you again PETRA Good WILL It 's not enough . I want to wake up beside you every morning . I want to make you breakfast . I want to see you off-guard , when you 're not so damn clever and in control . I want you to work again and be admired , I want to watch you realize how gifted you are PETRA Am I ? ! Tell me more ! WILL Why deny it ? They called you brilliant . p. 54 PETRA The critics ? WILL They have been right on occasion . PETRA I wo n't tell Rubin you said that . WILL You 're afraid , Petra . PETRA I 'm afraid of ardent dreamers on missions of mercy . I 'm afraid of their confusion . WILL I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been with you . PETRA More , Will , more . WILL I mean it . PETRA Then for your sake I shall mourn the loss of a brilliant career . And for your sake , I 'll keep a careful eye on what I am . Dream your dreams . Write them in books . Dedicate one to me . That 's what you do well . But do n't confuse it with life . WILL You make me sound like a fool . PETRA ( Moved . ) Oh , Will ; to me you 're astonishing , and beautiful and so very innocent even of the things you do , and it makes you far more dangerous than a hundred Rubins , because you turn every mistake into a story about someone else and forgive them in print with a few kind words , when it 's really yourself you 're forgiving . Life wo n't do that for the rest of us. p. 55 WILL Was it my child ? PETRA Make love to me , Will . WILL Was it ? PETRA ( Pause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILL I 've been wondering all night . When did you lose it ? PETRA Let 's call the whole story Rubin 's invention . WILL Petra PETRA ( Firm . ) Can we please agree on that ? Can you spare me one small fiction , Will ? WILL It was mine . PETRA It was mine . And I chose to keep it that way . Forever . No more , Will , please . WILL Does it make a difference that I love you ? PETRA None . WILL That I want to marry you , that I want your child ? PETRA Sorry , I have none to spare . WILL That I need you . PETRA Will , please , do n't come in here . Its not fair . ( SHE begins to tremble . WILL moves to hold her , but SHE extends her arm to keep him back . SHE speaks impersonally. ) p. 56 PETRA When they took it out-pulled him out of me  --  I lay awake most of the night . A fever , they said . I saw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake , this lake  --  my little warrior sinking down , down poor helpless white thing , no bottom to catch him , nowhere to rest , falling away from me through that chilly green darkness . Then he was gone . And I called his name ; ( With shattering pain . ) WILL ! ! ! ( WILL grabs her in a protective embrace and SHE pulls herself close , the words spilling out . ) PETRA Fill me again , put another life inside that wo n't fall away , give me something to care for and keep safe from harm , give me something to do ! ( Moving suddenly away . ) Forget what I just said . You should n't know these things . WILL If what you lost was partly mine , why should n't I know ? PETRA I did n't lose anything . I chose not to have it . I do n't want your child . I would n't do that to Rubin . WILL Only to me . I 'm flattered . PETRA Some things are n't to be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's my husband . WILL I see . p. 57 PETRA You do n't . And it does n't matter . I 'm with you for other things . WILL Tell me , Petra , why are you with Rubin ? Is he your excuse for denying everything what you want ? A career ? A family ? A life of your own ? Do you get some perverse satisfaction out of giving it all up for his sake ? PETRA Have I given up ? WILL It certainly looks that way . PETRA To who , darling ? A half-day visitor who 's seen a brief moment in the very long slow struggle of a marriage , where small victories mean nothing ? I have n't given up . I 've only learned patience , it 's my husband who 's lost and ca n't find a way out . WILL Out of what ? ! What you 're doing here is all by his choice . PETRA And my consent . And the result ; I have you back . Plus a lovely summer house when Rubin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to work again . Whereas Rubin ? He 's discovered that you do n't need his praise . And that he ca n't live without me . If you 're looking to rescue someone , try my husband . WILL It 's quite a game you play . Each pretends it 's the other one in trouble . PETRA It 's no game , Will . Rubin is in despair . His excuse for the move here was a great work , something for the ages . But when he sat to write , nothing came . You know the feeling . As he says over and over , mostly for effect , but it 's true nonetheless , I 'm all he has  --  for now . p. 58 WILL So he lied about working up there every day ? What does he do , just sit and look out the window ? PETRA He reads . He thinks . He worries about my leaving . Maybe wonders finally what he 's doing here . It 's hard for Rubin to admit mistakes ; like thinking distance would put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , he does n't know about us . ( Beat . ) Does he ? PETRA No . Yes , maybe ; what difference does it make ? WILL That we may have been carrying on all this time with his permission , that makes no difference ? PETRA What an odd way to look at it . WILL Tell me another . PETRA That our desires matter more to us than his pain . That he has no choice in the matter , but he bears it with a certain grace , which in the end is all there is . Besides calling things by their proper name . WILL ( Beat . ) How can you live with such horrible clarity ? PETRA I 'm a woman . I have no choice . WILL It 's strange ; all these years and suddenly you seem a complete stranger . p. 59 PETRA That 's what islands are for . Stay on the beach , Will . Inland you 'll find the natives restless . WILL I 'm not afraid of him . PETRA Oh , dear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have ? PETRA Make love to me , Will . I wo n't ask again . ( WILL approaches her . SHE gasps at his touch . HE moves his hand to her breast . ) WILL This way ? PETRA Perfect . You see ? Nothing 's changed . ( HE kisses her neck . HER head falls back . ) PETRA Yes , Will , yes , yes ( The LIGHT fades ) p. 60 Act 2 , Scene 2 : Author 's Scene 7 Scene 7 SCENE : THE LIVING ROOM AT RISE : RUBIN lies on the sofa , eyes closed , book open on his stomach . WILL enters and watches Rubin for a moment . WILL Rubin ? ( Pause . ) Rubin ? RUBIN ( Not moving . ) I 'm here , Will . WILL I have something to say . RUBIN Writers . They always do . WILL It 's about Petra . It 's about Petra and me . RUBIN Petra and I. WILL Petra and me . RUBIN I believe you 're right . WILL Would you sit up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my wife . She told you secrets . Should I stop worrying ? WILL We made love . ( Pause . ) Rubin , I made love to her . RUBIN Did she ask you to spill the beans ? WILL No . RUBIN Then why are you doing it ? p. 61 WILL Look at me . RUBIN I do n't need to . I can picture you . WILL We 're having an affair . We have been for several years . RUBIN You 're a regular fountain of confessions tonight . WILL I 'm sorry , - Rubin . I know this must hurt . RUBIN But , of course , you never meant to cause pain . WILL Will you please sit up ? ( RUBIN , opens his eyes and sits up , not looking at Will . HE puts on his shoes . HIS manner is weary , distracted . ) RUBIN When did it start ? Were you still married ? WILL Why ? RUBIN Facts comfort me . Where ? When ? That sort of thing . Were there others involved who you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over coffee ? Did you take milk , did the spoon clink in the cup ? I 'm stalling , Will , my mind needs time to catch up . ( Beat . ) I see ; you 've been fucking my wife . WILL She thinks you might have known all along . RUBIN And if I had ? ( Pause . ) Nothing . It 's a possibility . p. 62 RUBIN But a nothing possibility . That all these years I might have been watching your laughter , your shy off handish way of slipping me a new manuscript with a feeble joke to hide the anxiety ; that through all that I might have seen you as little more than a treacherous shit who is fucking my wife  --  that is a nothing possibility WILL Rubin , did you know ? RUBIN More to the point , did you ? Did you consider that if your dalliance became public less , if simply I found out , I 'd never be able to review you again ? Did you intend that ? Was Petra your opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun does not rise so you 'll have light to read by . Many things on earth happen without a thought for you . RUBIN You 're a terrible liar . WILL You do n't believe me ? RUBIN Worse than that . I think you believe yourself And in Rome , that 's the only lie we wo n't forgive . WILL Why do n't you just throw something ? Hit me . Anything but this calm of yours , it 's eerie . RUBIN ( Pause . ) What do you think of me , Will , now that cards are on the table ? p. 63 WILL ( Pause . ) I think you do n't care about anything or anyone . I think you 're ruthless , that you 'd tell any lie to have your way . I think you 've treated Petra terribly and you do n't deserve her . RUBIN Do you ? WILL I 'm in love with her . RUBIN Ah , love ! Well , that changes everything . You are fucking my wife , but with love . WILL You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The theme here would seem to be what  --  love , confession , a general drift towards getting off the hook . WILL I did not tell you about Petra to get off the hook . Exactly the opposite , in fact . RUBIN The opposite ? What would that be , to face the truth with honesty and courage ? Ah , nobler by the minute . WILL Fine , Rubin , make it ugly , drag it over the carpet and wipe your feet on it . RUBIN Why now , Will ? Why did n't you tell me a month ago ? A year ? Why not before the deed ? Why did n't you first ask permission to use what 's mine ? WILL She 's not your property . She 's not an object , she does n't belong to anyone . p. 64 RUBIN But you 're trying to take her away , and that gesture speaks of possession . You ca n't have her ; she 's mine . WILL You may have no choice . RUBIN Nothing like success to make a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize . WILL I came because Petra invited me . RUBIN I asked her to . WILL ( Pause . ) You ? RUBIN Lets deal , lets add up the numbers . You 've no doubt noticed that I 'm a very rich man . What exactly do you offer ? WILL My big brother can lick your big brother , is that the game ? RUBIN Petra likes nice things . Oh , yes , she once fucked me for love , or whatever word serves the need here , but then she fucked many others for love before me , and will no doubt , for love , fuck many more in times to come , wild thing that she is , but she wo n't marry them because she knows her way around the hard world , the one you 're trying to crash now , except you 'd better learn the rules if you want to survive here for very long , because in this place it all comes down to property , as in who owns who . WILL ( Laughs . ) To think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool me all these years ? p. 65 RUBIN You lack confidence , most writers do . Not now , of course , not at this moment , but will it last ? I mean , when the next book fails , or the one after , when the culture bees move on to sweeter flowers , what then , when your words pour out unread , unwanted whose shoulder do you cry on , whose hand do you hold ? Petra , who detests any sign of weakness , of need ? Do you see my concern ? WILL You are a truly malevolent creature . I always suspected as much , but would n't admit what I felt . RUBIN Trust your instincts , Will . They 're all you have . WILL What I really think of you , since you ask  --  what most , in fact most people think  --  is that you 're a sham , all calculation and effect ; the sly looks , the innuendo , how you wait in pointed silence till everyone stops talking , then utter the final judgement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as everyone knows . The needling remarks to suggest we 're none of us quite smart enough or witty enough or generally up to your lofty expectations . Even the way you left town without explanation  --  anything to cause a stir , to create mystery , when the only real puzzle is why Petra wasted her time on such a transparent fraud in the first place . RUBIN ( Points at Will . ) That ! That feeling of power . Is n't it wonderful ! ? Right this minute , everything seems possible . p. 66 WILL Petra says you 've lost your nerve and she 's all you have left . I hope so . Because I 'm going to take her away and leave you with nothing . RUBIN ( Smiles . ) Honesty at last . We 're getting there , Will . We 're bridging the old gap . WILL Your move , Rubin . RUBIN Here 's how I see it . My wife is a rare jewel everyone desires her . But I do n't wish to yield possession . WILL Strip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There must be a better way than to lock horns for mating rights . WILL Have n't I already won that battle ? RUBIN ( Beat . ) That was murderous , Will . Maybe you are an authentic bastard after all . Maybe you can handle success . Shall we find out ? WILL By all means . RUBIN ( Takes two pistols from a drawer in the sideboard . Offers one to Will . ) This one 's more accurate . WILL ( Laughs . ) Guns ? RUBIN It 's loaded . ( Offers spare clip . ) Extra bullets . p. 67 WILL ( Smiles . ) Are you proposing a duel ? RUBIN A hunt . Go outside , and start walking . Five minutes later , I follow . The winner gets Petra . WILL ( Beat . ) " Then he pulled out two pistols and offered a manhunt in the woods . " Good story , but they 'll never believe it in the city , even about you . RUBIN How else to settle this ? I 'll take suggestions . WILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there  --  RUBIN Do n't waver . First rule of engagement , press an attack  --  the advantage is yours right now because Petra thinks more highly of you than she should , what with all the hoopla-she is , after all , human and success is magic . Not to mention the fact that I 'm a little off-balance these days , having found that certain people I counted on were treacherous in a way I never thought possible  --  not a mistake I 'll make again , I assure you WILL Put the gun away . RUBIN Do n't be tedious , Will . Do n't pretend this is n't for real . PETRA ( Descends the stairway in her nightgown . ) What am I missing ? p. 68 RUBIN Look at her ; a true vision . Well worth the risk . PETRA Is n't it a little late in the day for target practice ? WILL I told him . PETRA ( Beat . ) Oh , Will . WILL He knew . I think he knew . PETRA ( To Rubin . ) Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed and we 'll talk it over . RUBIN How 's that for nerve ? Not a tremor in the voice . Not a bead of sweat . PETRA You 're not going to shoot each other . I mean , it 's all very sweet and medieval and what , something with a d , but could n't someone get hurt ? RUBIN Take it . Extra clip . ( RUBIN holds out gun . WILL make no move to take it . ) PETRA That 's enough , dear . ( RUBIN tosses the gun , which WILL catches reflexively . ) RUBIN I 'll go first . I was being polite . The second man out is framed in the doorway , clean target . ( Shrugs ; starts out . ) Have it your way . ( Exits. ) p. 69 WILL Rubin , I have n't fired a gun in years PETRA Go to bed . Let him walk it off . WILL Christ , Petra , he 's armed . I just made love to you . In his house . PETRA It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts things right . PETRA He 's upset . What did you expect , a civilized chat between two rational men ? WILL Something like that , yes . PETRA You should know Rubin better by now . WILL I need a drink . PETRA ( Pouring for him . ) A drink , yes , then sleep . I 'll use my room . You do n't mind , do you ? WILL Be my guest . PETRA Be mine , Will . And a little less difficult . I feed you , make love to you , tell you secrets , and all you do is crash around breaking things that I 'll have to fix when you 're gone . There are limits to one 's hospitality . WILL Pardon me . Pardon me for thinking we 'd moved a little beyond hospitality . ( Pause . ) Petra ? PETRA A painting right there . Just what this room needs . ( Playful . ) You 're good for me , Will . You 've restored my sense of judgement . When can we meet in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PETRA ( With sudden , steely force . ) Do n't lose your nerve , Will . Not now . WILL We 're supposed to carry on as if he knew nothing ? PETRA You did n't have to tell him . WILL But I did tell him . And that changes things . PETRA Except it seems he already knew . So things are pretty much the same , only in the open . WILL ( Beat . ) You 're a frightening woman , Petra . PETRA If you want out , just say it . WILL . I want you . PETRA Then stop whining . I 'm yours . In the city , I 'm yours . ( SHE hands him his drink with a kiss , then starts upstairs . Stopping . ) With me you have nothing to prove , my Will . ( Smiles . ) My puppy . ( SHE goes . ) ( WILL sits heavily on the couch , gun inches away beside him . A distant call from outdoors ) RUBIN ( Offstage . ) Will. ? ? ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glances up the stairs . Pause . Deciding , HE starts outside . On second thought , HE turns back inside with stealth and flicks off the light DARKNESS. ) p. 71 Act 2 , Scene 3 : Author 's Scene 8 Scene 8 SCENE : THE FOREST AT RISE : Dappled MOONLIGHT through the trees . RUBIN stands alert , gun in hand , exhilarated as HE calls into the darkness . RUBIN ( Loud . ) Did I hear a twig snap ? Willum , is it you ? Look at us , armed to the teeth under heavy camouflage . I 'm reminded of Elaine 's . ( Listens . ) Was that a laugh ? I never thought you 'd come outside , Will . I 'm impressed . ( HE spins suddenly in a crouch , pulling out his gun . Pause . HE relaxes . ) Do you have a press agent ? After the Contessa you 'll need to hone your image . Buy a farm . Have your picture taken firing guns ; that 's what they love in Gotham , dangerous-but-safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a hit ? ( HE moves offstage in the direction of his gun as the LIGHTS shift , a vertiginous turning of moonbeam and shadow which stops finally to indicate : ) SCENE : A NEW PLACE WILL is crouched , listening . RUBIN ( Offstage . ) No fair , Will , you have to fire back . PETRA ( Offstage , distant . ) Will ? p. 72 WILL Go inside . RUBIN ( Offstage . ) There you are . PETRA ( Offstage , distant . ) Rubin , for God sake , leave him alone . WILL I 'm all right . Stay where you are . RUBIN ( Offstage . ) But will she obey ? WILL ( Spins , points his pistol . ) Come out , Rubin , I see you . RUBIN ( Offstage . ) Fire away . WILL I could n't if I wanted to . RUBIN ( Offstage . ) Do n't you want to ? WILL Of course not . ( GUNSHOT . WILL drops to ground . ) WILL Christ , Rubin , are you crazy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUBIN ( Offstage . ) Defend yourself . Return fire . PETRA ( Offstage , distant . ) Will , are you all right ? WILL ( Calls . ) Do n't come any closer . ( Quieter . ) I 'm putting this down , Rubin . I 'm only here to talk . p. 73 RUBIN ( Offstage . ) After darkening the house and slipping out the window gun in hand ? A new approach to conversation . WILL ( Laying gun on ground . ) I 'm unarmed . RUBIN ( Offstage . ) Take it off the ground , that 's my best weapon . Pick up the fucking gun ! ! ! WILL ( Obeys , bewildered . ) Okay , okay ! I 'm putting it away . ( Tucks gun in waistband and raises arms wide . ) See , I 'm not going to use it . ( Three SHOTS in quick succession . WILL reels , yanks out pistol and tugs the trigger frantically . ) PETRA ( Offstage , closer . ) Stop it , please God stop it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing does n't work . RUBIN ( Offstage . ) Is the safety off ? That lever on the side , flick it up . WILL ( Glancing at gun . ) Rubin , this is absurd . How long are you going to keep it up ? PETRA ( Offstage , nearer . ) Stay quiet , Will . I called the police . p. 74 RUBIN ( Offstage . ) Do n't be a killjoy , dearest , he knows we have no phone . PETRA ( Offstage . ) I drove to the Harkins . RUBIN ( Offstage . ) Did n't I tell you they were nice people ? ( GUNSHOT . WILL flips the safety , spins and aims at nothing . ) PETRA ( Offstage . ) Will , are you hurt ? WILL This is murder , what you 're doing , it 's murder ! RUBIN ( Offstage . ) Are you the only one allowed to get away with it ? PETRA ( Offstage . ) Stay quiet and wait for help , please , Will . RUBIN ( Offstage . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keys I 'd say the same . Your best bet is the gypsies now . Swim across , tell them you diddled my wife and I 'm after you with a gun . They 'll understand . ( LIGHTS shift , WILL stalks off into the darkness and as : ) PETRA ( Offstage . ) Rubin ! SCENE : A NEW PLACE PETRA enters , coat thrown over nightgown. p. 75 PETRA Rubin ? Can you hear me ? RUBIN ( Offstage . ) Yes , my love . PETRA Please come out . He 's not the one to blame , if that 's what you need . ( Pause . RUBIN enters behind and listens in the shadows . ) PETRA Will could never make the first move , he would n't know how . ( Looking around . ) You know what I 'm like when I want something . He never stood a chance . But he did try very hard to resist . You mean a great deal to him . RUBIN Do you suppose he heard ? PETRA ( Turns . ) There you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to think you were , I do n't know , sort of spineless , along for the ride . Is she right ? ( To Petra . ) He must not have heard , he 'd be angry . PETRA You 've made your point , darling . RUBIN He has this manly idea of himself , **35;2814;TOOLONG . He 'd be upset if he knew you thought of him as a SPINELESS PUSSY . No , he definitely did n't hear . ( PETRA reaches for the gun , an almost careless gesture . RUBIN moves it out of reach. ) p. 76 PETRA Come back to the house . RUBIN I 'm not finished . PETRA With what ? RUBIN Entertaining your lover . PETRA Is this why you wanted him here ? To teach a lesson ? RUBIN It 's my calling , dear . I keep writers in line . PETRA You 've known about Will and me from the start . RUBIN Pretty much . PETRA And you accepted it until now . What changed ? RUBIN Let 's say he disappointed me . PETRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's doing too well . RUBIN Oh , that too . ( NOISE offstage . RUBIN listens . ) PETRA Let it go , darling . We 're here . This is what you wanted . To him , we mean nothing now . RUBIN Then why did he come ? PETRA Give me the gun . RUBIN Are you afraid for him ? PETRA For you . RUBIN That I 'll go mad because my wife loves another man ? p. 77 PETRA What 's love got to do with it ? RUBIN ( Loud . ) WILLUM , DID YOU HEAR ? MY WIFE DOES N'T LOVE YOU . This will be a blow . He 's counting on noble words to elevate many a sordid fuck , one of them mere feet above my head . PETRA Stop it , Rubin . Why do you embarrass us ? Why run around the woods letting him see your desperation ? RUBIN Wrong , darling . On the whole , I 'm a cheery fellow . PETRA You 're frightened to death , and it 's pointless . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you failed to be " anything-but-ordinary . " Because we just are n't that important any more , except to each other . ( Beat . ) Could n't the two of us be enough ? RUBIN Save the odd hump with Will ? PETRA He makes it bearable , darling . For now . At least I chose a man you admire . Unlike the tremulous neurotics you needed to fill the gaps and never told me about . ( SHE smiles playfully . ) I defer to your taste in all things , even my own needs RUBIN You undo me . You devastate . So perfect . So endless . PETRA You do like him , do n't you ? ( Again , SHE smiles . ) Murderous rage and jealousy aside . p. 78 RUBIN Go with Will . Now . I wo n't stop you . PETRA I never run away . RUBIN I have nothing left that you want , Petra . Why do you stay ? PETRA Because I know this will end and we 'll look back on it like a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . ( THEY embrace and kiss . ) RUBIN Make coffee . I 'll join you in a moment . PETRA ( Pause . ) Let me have the gun . WILL ( Offstage , distant . ) Rubin ? RUBIN You see ? He needs me . You , then me . ( RUBIN fires in the air once , then hits empty chambers . HE scoops bullets from his pocket and starts reloading ) PETRA ( Loud . ) DO N'T TALK , WILL . DO N'T MOVE . LIE DOWN AND KEEP ABSOLUTELY STILL . WILL ( Offstage , distant . ) Rubin , are you there ? RUBIN ( Fixing Will 's position . ) Bang . PETRA Stop talking , Will . For God sake , do n't you ever know when to shut up ? ( RUBIN sights and follows something offstage slowly as PETRA backs away and exits. ) p. 79 RUBIN Impulsive white silk catches the moonlight . Take off the shirt . Rub your body with dirt . WILL ( Offstage . ) Is Petra with you ? RUBIN ( Smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare car key , we have n't much time , better ask now ( RUBIN slips offstage and continues talking as the LIGHTS shift to indicate : ) SCENE . A NEW PLACE RUBIN ( Offstage . ) I know what 's on your mind , do n't be shy . ( WILL darts on stage with a glance back as HE crouches and begins to unbutton his shirt . ) RUBIN ( Offstage . ) The answer is yes , Will , what every author wants to know ; yes , I read your book ! ( WILL looks up from his shirt . ) RUBIN ( Offstage . ) Well , go on , next question , " Is it as good as everyone says ? " ( Pause . ) That silence takes real control . ( WILL motionless , strains to hear . ) RUBIN ( Offstage . ) It was brilliant ! A bold departure , and perfectly achieved . Are n't you glad you come ? ( WILL shakes his head , a slight smile of amusement on his face , having understood ( HE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I quote you ? RUBIN ( Offstage . ) Such sureness of tone , such a bold and simple theme ; the idle rich as deeply human . You 've outdone yourself . WILL Are you finished ? RUBIN ( Offstage . ) You may indeed quote me . On the cover itself  --  if it reaches a sixth printing . If it has n't already . WILL Eighth . RUBIN ( Offstage . ) I 'm speechless . Might I achieve the ninth ? WILL You 'll enjoy this , guess what the Contessa called it : " A fabbo read . " RUBIN ( Offstage . ) Was that before or after sex ? WILL I knew you 'd hate the book . In fact , the thought of your disdain actually inspired me . I knew of all people you 'd sense the joy in the writing , the sheer , sinful pleasure of the prose . Maybe tear the book in half with rage , some dramatic gesture like that . Did you ? RUBIN ( Offstage . ) How nice that I was on your mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you hear ? p. 81 RUBIN ( Offstage . ) Whenever could they resist a masterpiece ? Which is almost certainly what you 've given us . WILL No , Rubin . It 's a folly , a lark , a piece of fun . The best joke is how so many of your colleagues took it seriously . Are n't you amused ? I know you prefer my work a little difficult , a little oblique and tortured so you can explain to the public why it 's good , but you will allow me a little fun now and then , wo n't you ? RUBIN ( Offstage . ) With another man 's wife WILL Stick to the subject . RUBIN ( Offstage . ) You insult my intelligence , trying to sneak past me pee-pee in one hand , pen in the other , calling one outrage true love and the other a harmless lark , when recent interviews suggest you 've come to take this lark of yours oh , very seriously , not to mention your lust and your ambition and your talent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Big Guy . WILL ( Beat . ) Who do you think you are , God ? RUBIN ( Offstage . ) What a good idea ! Yes , I'd-like that , I 'd very much like the power to send authors to Book Hell for shabby work and other abuses of trust . p. 82 WILL Rubin , wake up . You are nothing . You simply do n't matter , you never did . I tried very hard for a time to take you seriously . It mattered so much to you , being a part of what I did , taking a little credit . I mean , it ca n't be easy to love writing and be held in contempt by those who do it . To see them avoid you on the street  --  or worse , make hollow chit-chat when all they want from you is a good review and a laugh behind your back . Do you realize that no one notices your absence . There 's a new man in your job now , " tiddly pum . " Your name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she had qualities . She added something to the picture . We 'd welcome her back , whereas your return would be a cold rain . What you are , Rubin , is weather ; sunshine one day , drizzle the next  --  something to put up with until we can duck indoors and make new work . RUBIN ( Offstage . ) Are n't you forgetting one thing ? WILL What 's that ? ( GUNSHOT . WILL 's hand flies to his head and HE feels for blood . HE is n't hit . ) RUBIN ( Offstage . ) I have a gun . WILL ( Subdued . ) Rubin , you 're not you would n't really kill me , would you ? ( The LIGHTS now shift to define : ) SCENE : TWO AREAS RUBIN entering the second . BOTH men are now in separate " places " to while on stage together . THEY sense each other 's " closeness " and continue in nervous , urgent undertones , peering into the darkness around them . p. 83 RUBIN I passed up one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILL You should have said yes . If you knew about me and your wife . RUBIN I do n't kick a man when he 's down . WILL ( Smiles . ) Down ? ! Oh , I can handle it , Rubin . I think I can find comfort in the half million readers who like my book . RUBIN You did n't send it to them , you sent it to me . WILL Wrong . The publisher 's mailing list must be out of date . I 'll have them delete your name . RUBIN You 've used up all the lies . Why keep on when you see the outcome ? Your well is dry . Petra told me , the words wo n't come any more . You 're in trouble , old friend . WILL Wrong again . I started something tonight . RUBIN I read your notes . There 's no book there . WILL Now we judge before the deed ? What next ? Submit our ideas to you first , apply for permission to start work ? RUBIN Not a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( WILL , suddenly , ( as if ) hearing a noise , spins and aims offstage . RUBIN , ( as if ) reacting , ducks and exits quickly . WILL tracks his imaginary path with gun as dappled LIGHT fills out his area. ) p. 84 WILL I see you . RUBIN ( Offstage . ) Fire away . WILL Rubin , what do you want ? RUBIN ( Offstage . ) I want you to get down on your knees and beg my forgiveness . WILL Fuck you . RUBIN ( Offstage . ) All right then , fight for the prize . ( GUNSHOT . WILL grabs his arm . ) WILL ( Amazed . ) You hit me . RUBIN ( Offstage . ) A graze . WILL Rubin , I 'm bleeding . RUBIN ( Offstage . ) Fire back , you chickenshit dreamer . Show me what you 'd kill for or get down on your knees ; there is no in-between . ( WILL , trembling , takes aim and fires at Rubin Offstage . ) RUBIN ( Offstage . ) That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowering gun . ) Do you realize how crazy this is ? If s grotesque . I wo n't do it . ( WILL backs away offstage. ) p. 85 RUBIN ( Offstage . ) Where is your passion , Will ? Where is your outrage ? ( RUBIN enters , watching something off-and-across stage . ) It 's your dream come true , and you wo n't seize the night . ( Pause . ) GOD , I FUCKING HATE WRITERS . All of you , like the Contessa said , grubby inside types ; ambitious , underhand , snivelling hypocrites  --  why wo n't you fight back ? Why did it take me to pee on Shumkin ? All those years shredding your colleagues in print and what did I get back ? Whiny letters of outrage and righteous indignation . You should have come after me with a knife . I wanted that ; someone to fear , someone to judge the judge , to make me accountable , someone worthy of my respect , and all I found was yapping midgets . That 's why I quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers added up equal to half my pen on a bad day . ( Pause . ) Hot damn , what a conversation , huh ? Come on , Will , argue back , let 's hear it for the artist ! ! ! WILL ( Offstage . ) I 'm going to the house . ( RUBIN sights Will offstage , fires and pursues him . Three GUNSHOTS . WILL reels onstage clutching his leg . ) WILL You fuck . You lunatic bastard king hell crazy shitfuck , this is n't funny any more . p. 86 RUBIN ( Offstage . ) That 's what I like to hear ! A bit of fighting spirit . We 're having fun now , are n't we ? WILL How does she put up with you ? RUBIN ( Offstage . ) Never a dull moment in Rome . WILL You 're both a little screwy , if you want to know the truth . RUBIN ( Offstage . ) PETRA , DID YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAID ? ( Quieter . ) Boy , that was unkind , Will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILL You made shit , Rubin . Take your fifty-five select readers , I'II settle for the public . I do n't need you any more . RUBIN ( Offstage . ) You 'll miss me WILL It 's a cross I can bear . RUBIN ( Offstage . ) The cross you must bear , Will  --  please take this to heart  --  is that greatness is beyond you . ( GUNSHOT ; WILL spins around , grazed in the leg . ) With hard work , you 'll achieve a sturdy competence . Your name will appear on syllabi across the land under " suggested additional reading . " This is not to be sneezed at . p. 87 WILL I 'll fucking kill you . RUBIN ( Offstage . ) Touched a nerve , have we ? WILL Come out , you bastard . Show me where you are . Come out where I can see you . RUBIN ( Enters behind . ) Never since Shumkin have I felt so close to a man . ( WILL spins around and aims directly at Rubin 's chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the size of a true killer . WILL Give me one reason , one excuse to fire . Please . RUBIN That you need me to says it all . ( WILL begins to lower his gun . ) RUBIN What the hell , if you insist . ( RUBIN raises his gun suddenly and aims at WILL , who , with a reflexive jerk , fires at Rubin ; BANG ! After a brief moment ) RUBIN ( Taking gun calmly . ) One day I may trust you with real bullets . But not tonight . What say we have a drink ? ( RUBIN exits . WILL stands watching him. ) p. 88 Act 2 , Scene 4 : Author 's Scene 9 Scene 9 SCENE : THE DOCK AT RISE : Morning . PETRA sits with coffee watching the lake ( us ) . RUBIN enters , jaunty . RUBIN The detective was n't necessary . PETRA I did n't ask . It 's procedure . RUBIN Look , his card . ( Shows it . ) Stone mason . Must be a sideline . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Would you like breakfast ? PETRA Leave me alone . RUBIN Do n't sulk . He 's a little shaken , but none the worse for wear . PETRA You 've made your point . RUBIN Dreamers need a loud bang . PETRA Yes , yes , very witty , very elegant , very perverse . I 'm sure he 'll tell stories in the city . RUBIN That 's unfair , darling . This was a selfless act . PETRA Like Shumkin . RUBIN Lovely day for a drive , would you like that ? A swim ? It 's your lake , too . ( Pause . ) We could buy the chest . PETRA I 'll shop in the city , thank you . p. 89 RUBIN He wo n't see you again , I 'm quite sure . PETRA He will . RUBIN If you insist . As long as I know . You look radiant . PETRA Do n't gloat . It 's my natural color . RUBIN ( Suddenly , with intense feeling . ) Thank God for you . PETRA ( Comforting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll ask to review a book or two . Let off steam in small ways . It seems to build up inside , otherwise . Not very healthy . WILL ( Enters , carrying his overnight bag . HE limps slightly . ) Would someone drive me to the station ? RUBIN Breakfast ? The train 's not for hours . WILL ( An appeal . ) Petra ? RUBIN My wife did n't sleep much . We 've been reminiscing . I 'll drive . WILL I prefer Petra . RUBIN That 's clear . ( PETRA starts to rise . ) RUBIN Sit down , darling , I have calls to make in town . ( Beat . ) What happened last night  --  it 's between us , yes ? p. 90 WILL ( Blurts out . ) I could be dead right now , did that cross your mind ? ! RUBIN I 'm an excellent shot . WILL In the dark ? At that range ? You were ready to kill me , were n't you ? RUBIN That would be a terrible loss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rubin . This was n't necessary . ( RUBIN 's arm is around Petra 's shoulder now . WILL sees their closeness . ) RUBIN By the way , your notes this morning ; much better WILL When did you ? RUBIN Two men and woman beside a lake . That you must write . I like the phrase PETRA Rubin , enough . Go . RUBIN I do believe in you , Will . In spite of everything . Maybe because of it . But I do . ( Exits . ) PETRA ( Pause . ) I 'm sorry , Will . How do you feel ? ( Smiles . ) He got a little carried away . Well , we all did . WILL It 's not enough for him to play with reputations any more ? Now he has to play with life ? p. 91 PETRA Very good . Will that go in the story ? WILL Is that what this is to you , Petra ; fiction ? PETRA It 's over . We 're in your hands , now . I hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her husband , they talked all morning , then had breakfast and waited for their guest ? PETRA To finish writing , yes Is n't that happy ? WILL My God PETRA What ? WILL You adore him , do n't you ? PETRA Why else would I stay ? WILL ( Beat , then , almost in spite of himself . ) When you invited me Petra , was this something between the two of you , did you know what he had in mind ? PETRA I doubt even he knew that , Will . Look , he loves your work , and he takes things very much to heart . After all , we did behave abysmally . And it was a rotten book . WILL ( Smiles . ) The middle chapters were n't bad . One book , for God sake . PETRA No excuses . You have what you came for . Do n't you ? p. 92 WILL Yes and no . PETRA Oh , always that . Patience , Will . Write . Just write . WILL Will we see each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? WILL This is between you and me . PETRA The critic 's wife , and his friend ? WILL He 's not my friend . PETRA No more lies , Will . WILL He 's a shit . And a tyrant . And a destructive , egotistical maniac . PETRA You 'll forget all that , and sooner than you think . I can picture you , all sullen , fighting how much you need to talk about your notes , hating that you want him to ask , but glad when he does , and by the time the train pulls in you 'll both be chattering away , closer than anything the world can touch . The way it is for a moment when you 're with me . And when I 'm with Rubin . WILL ( Beat . ) If you should ever think of leaving him PETRA ( Amused . ) In the city . From time to time . Do you accept ? WILL ( Pause . ) Do I have a choice ? p. 93 PETRA In this , yes . ( Smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pause . ) I accept . PETRA Then so do I , my darling Will . Thank you . ( From her chair SHE kisses his hand . THEIR eyes meet . HE goes . A pause . ) PETRA So do I. ( PETRA , with a languorous smile , stretches in the sunshine. )
