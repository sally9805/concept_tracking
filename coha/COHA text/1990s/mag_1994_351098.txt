AS FANS OF MASTERPIECE THEatre well know , adaptations of great books sometimes make for less than great viewing . Anyone out there in favor of some Bleak House reruns ? All the more reason to cheer , therefore , when one of public TV 's bundles from Britain elegantly packages a literary classic . <P> Middlemarch is a six-part rendering of George Eliot 's monumental novel that premieres on Masterpiece Theatre this Sunday . The mini-series , which cost some $10 million to make , was a recent critical and popular success in Britain , leading to lectures and even debates on the novel . As a result of the show , a Penguin paperback of the novel topped best-seller lists for five weeks , and is still doing well . The town of Stamford in Lincolnshire , where exteriors were filmed , is preparing for a summertime influx of tourists . <P> In America , PBS is hoping for at least a mini-hit , and Random House has issued a handsome new Modern Library edition of the book . But can the series ' success at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Masterpiece Theatre host Russell Baker wryly suggests , many Americans , like himself , developed a terminal aversion to Eliot 's writing after having to read Silas Marner in ninth grade . That is a shame . Middlemarch is truly among the greatest books ever written and is , as Virginia Woolf put it , " one of the few English novels written for grown-up people . " Its author , whose given name was Mary Ann ( later Marian ) Evans , was a Victorian feminist who lived openly with a married man and pursued a career as a writer and editor . <P> Middlemarch was published in installments in 1871 and ' 72 , but the action of the book , which the mini-series dutifully reflects , takes place in the troubled 1830s . Railways have begun to girdle ( and befoul ) England 's green and pleasant land , and the Industrial Revolution has brought new wealth to towns like Eliot 's fictional Middlemarch . The passage of the Reform Bill of 1832 , which enlarged the franchise , has created fear of revolution among reactionaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elitist Parliament . <P> Middlemarch is a moral tale , but one told with frequently mordant wit . At the novel 's center are two altruists whose yearning to serve others is frustrated in large measure by ill-advised marriages . Dorothea Brooke ( Juliet Aubrey ) is ward of her eccentric uncle Arthur ( Robert Hardy ) , who is known as " the worst landlord in the county " for the shabby way he treats his tenants . Dorothea 's desire to improve the lot of others leads her to wed the Rev. Edward Casaubon ( Patrick Malahide ) , a scholar and cleric more than twice her young age . She is enraptured by his dream  --  to write a book proving that all religions stem from the same source . <P> Casaubon , as Dorothea soon discovers , is a pious monster . He rejects both her love and her offer to help with his work . He is uncontrollably jealous of attentions paid her by his impoverished cousin Will Ladislaw ( Rufus Sewell ) , a handsome would-be artist turned political journalist . After Casaubon 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his will : she will forfeit his estate if she marries Ladislaw  --  which , at Middlemarch 's end , she does anyway . ( In an unconvincing final chapter , which the series summarizes in a voice-over , Eliot assures readers that the marriage is a happy one. )
