<p> Here are some columns I 'd write if the deadline were n't already here : <p> BLITZKRIEG  --  If it comes to war , says President Bush , American triumph will be swift . None of that Vietnam dilly-dallying , he says , fearing no doubt that Americans will abandon him fast unless he delivers instant triumph . American insistence on instant everything is worrisome , but the President offers it one more time . After lightning war cometh the new world order . Never again will big , powerful countries invade small , weak countries . The Soviet Union will have to get out of Lithuania , the United States out of Panama . <p> WIMP FACTOR  --  Fear of wimp ishness , which turns grown men into blustering schoolboys , is not peculiar to the United States . Why does Saddam Hussein , for instance , constantly reply like Attila the Iraqi when President Bush talks like Attila the Yale Man ? Because he fears losing face . What is lost face but wimphood ? I suspect Attila never intended to behave like Attila the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called him Attila the Wimp . <p> PATIENCE , HAH !  --  Politicians get into pickles because of lessons they 've learned . They make war in Vietnam because they 've learned the lesson of Munich . ( Ca n't appease Hitlers . ) They go for instant victory in Iraq because they 've learned the lesson of Vietnam . ( Dawdle and you lose the home front . ) It 's obvious President Bush has learned the lesson of Jimmy Carter , who ruined his Presidency by using patience to free the kidnapped Embassy Americans from the Iranians . Patience took a year and a half at a time Americans were in love with " Rambo " movies . Those urging President Bush to get Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait by patiently applying sanctions are shouting down a rain barrel . The next election is only 20 months away . President Bush has learned the lesson of Jimmy Carter . <p> SAMPLER SAMPLES  --  Here are sensible thoughts worth framing over White House fireplace mantles : <p> " The reluctant obedience of distant provinces generally costs more than it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " To be engaged in opposing wrong affords but a slender guarantee of being right . "  --  William Ewart Gladstone , Prime Minister of Great Britain . <p> " A decent provision for the poor is the true test of a civilization . "  --  Dr. Samuel Johnson , lexicographer and commercial writer . <p> TUNNEL VISION  --  Lack of American interest in providing decently for the poor is just one of many lacks . There 's a lack of government money . It all seems earmarked to pay for the expeditionary force in Araby and to shelter victims of the thieves , speculators and insouciant bankers who gave us the savings and loan catastrophe and the wild party in real estate . There 's a lack of interest in the rising power of the K.G.B. , Red Army and old Communist apparatchiks in Moscow . This reflects television 's tendency to set the public agenda by concentrating news coverage on the White House as melodrama and soap opera . ( " One Man 's Family , and Their Little Dog Millie . " ) When the President is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's problems must do without us . <p> NORIEGA  --  President Bush seems as irritated by Saddam Hussein as he was by Manuel Noriega . And look what happened to Noriega : eternal jail without trial in Miami . It 's like being condemned to the Chateau d'If , except there are Federal wiretappers in the next dungeon . First , however , he was blasted out of religious sanctuary by heavy rock ' n ' roll . Why do Presidents take such intense dislike to certain tinpots while finding others ( like Hafez al-Assad of Syria this week ) perfectly agreeable ? Remember the Sandinista President of Nicaragua who drove Ronald Reagan up the wall ? George Bush speaking of Saddam Hussein sounds prepared to be merciless with acid rock and heavy metal . <p> TRIALS OF FEMINISM  --  Women have it tough . Having struggled to win the right to go off to wars with men , they reach Saudi Arabia as their first big-time war zone , which insists that woman 's place is in hiding . In jail if they 're caught driving a car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worlds have different kinds of memory . Americans , too lazy perhaps to nurse grudges , are constantly letting bygones be bygones . In the Middle East there are no bygones , only ancient offenses to be avenged . The latest retaliatory vengeance in blood is the routine news of relationships between Arabs and Israelis . A good place for Americans to avoid , you 'd think . So in we plunge .
