IN MY FORMATIVE YEARS , THE STATIONS OF THE CROSS WERE a central part of my Catholic experience . Some four decades later , I 've grown , and the Stations have , too . I served as an altar boy at Stations before I attended as a participant . Carrying candle or cross , walking next to the priest down the center aisle , standing , genuflecting , standing , kneeling , singing , walking . Fourteen times . My eyes were always on the plaster Stations on the wall , but I ca n't say that I really meditated . I was more concerned with how to genuflect without spilling wax . I enjoyed serving the Stations . As a devotion , however , they were generally lost on me . The Passion is a great story , but the service took 20 minutes away from doing something else . Still , the Stations did help me appreciate the drama , courage , and love in the story . It pricked my conscience and imagination . Seeds were planted and impressions sown of images , smells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a title I only learned many years later ) is deeply embedded in my musical subconscious . Alas , I drifted away . Two decades passed between Stations services for me until I had my own children to bring . In relatively few years things had changed significantly for a centuries-old devotion . Several of my next Stations were " living Stations , " performed by teenagers- boys and girls . In my day there had been no living Stations and certainly no girls on the altar . Of course the devotional weight is lightened when you 're watching friends ' children occasionally suppress smiles . It 's poignant , but in a different way . The voice of the Stations changed , too . Although I do n't remember the words we prayed during my youth , my throwback priest would n't have chosen anything other than scripture-based reflections that focused exclusively on Jesus . Today many meditations focus on me and obstacles and temptations I might fece . They create a dialogue between the cross-burdened Jesus and me in almost breezy , contemporary language : " Though you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are truly one-one Christ " Everyone 's Way of the Cross , Ave Maria Press ) . Huh ? STILL , DESPITE THE NEW AGE ECHOES OF SOME MORE RECENT reflections , they open up the service where the sometimes stilted scriptural language obscured . They draw me into the story and invite me-force me-to think about how the Way of the Cross bears on my life , how the pain , indignities , kindnesses , and insults that Jesus experienced are repeated daily , even in the world that he saved . It becomes possible to imagine more dimensionality to the plaster figures on the wall . No longer just Simon or women of Jerusalem or soldier pushing Jesus , they 're partly me or someone I know or have heard of , today 's victims , victimizers , or bystanders . Structurally the difference between the Stations of then and now is in number . We now often do 15 stations , adding the Resurrection after the previously final burial of Jesus . Theologically the 15th station makes sense , of course . The Resurrection completed salvation . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A GRUMPY TRADITIONALIST , but I have issues . First , it 's a chronology thing . The Stations of the Cross is a Lenten devotion . The Resurrection follows Lent and begins everything anew . It does n't finish the Stations so much as it comes afterwards . It 's what we celebrate after Lent . We do n't say " Happy Easter " during the third week of Lent . The 15th station is also spoonfeeding . Adding the Resurrection creates a happy ending , making the foregoing violence easier to bear . It reminds me of my wife 's childhood wish every Holy Week that somehow this year Jesus would escape . You 'd think whoever added the 15th station thought we 'd forget what came after the 14th . Finally the old 14 stations played like a modern drama . The resolution of the conflict was offstage , outside the narrative . The old stations challenged us with their non-ending . They required intellectual work , some actual thinking about " what if . " That story ended with the apparent finality , even futility , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , but action , too . My New Age Stations guide notes , " Your 14 steps will only be complete when you have crowned them by your life . " I 'm reminded of my old geometry textbooks with proofs of geometric principles that showed only the first few steps and ended : " The rest is left for you . " Like Jesus ' friends that day , we were left at the end of the traditional Stations to wonder what will come next but also to ponder what 's now expected of us in the wake of no greater love . I DO N'T OPPOSE THE 15TH STATION . I do n't ask the usher on the way in , " Will it be 14 or 15 today ? " and then decide whether to stay . I know it 's not really about the drama or the story ; it 's about sacrifice and mercy , love and salvation . Whether it 's 14 or 15 steps , I 'm glad I 've come back to the Stations . Not only is it a tradition that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit , too .
