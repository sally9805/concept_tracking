<p> THE struggle for women 's rights , long overshadowed by the broader struggle against apartheid , has entered a new phase in the run-up to South Africa 's first democratic ballot . <p> South African women of all races are seeking a unified position to ensure that gender equality is enshrined in the new South African constitution . <p> The government has responded by addressing women 's rights in its draft Charter of Fundamental Human Rights and by simultaneously publishing three draft bills , which advance the position of women relating to domestic violence and establish gender equality in the workplace . <p> " The fact that women constitute 54 percent of eligible voters in the next general election stresses their political clout ... , " says Professor Ronel Erwee of Pretoria University 's Graduate School of Management . <p> According to Margaret Lessing , director of the independent Women 's Bureau in Pretoria , women 's rights in South Africa have lagged behind Western countries because of the " inherently chauvinistic tradition " of South African men - both black and white . <p> " Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Second World War , " Mrs. Lessing told the Monitor . <p> The Women 's Bureau , established in 1980 as a watchdog group to represent some 27 non-political women 's groups , has played a key role in formulating and improving the government 's draft legislation on women 's rights . <p> " Now political parties are focusing on women 's issues more actively than ever before , because they want the votes of women - particularly black women who will be voting for the first time - in the first democratic election , " she says . <p> In the past , the struggle for women 's rights has been divided along racial lines , and anti-apartheid women 's groups have tended to pursue broader political goals at the expense of promoting women 's interests within their parties or groups . <p> " It is difficult for South African women to talk only about women 's issues . The issue of race is always there , " says Glenda Simms , President of the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women and a participant in a recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Coalition ( WNC ) and the Washington-based Lawyers ' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law . <p> The WNC , a national umbrella body bringing together some 54 women 's groups nationwide , was established in April 1992 . The WNC conference May 7-9 illustrated that black women activists are reluctant to part company with their political groups as the vehicle for pursuing women 's interests . Three draft bills <p> Some delegates at the conference , which was not empowered to take binding decisions , backed a call on government to withdraw the three draft bills on women 's rights because there had been inadequate consultation with the women and no acknowledgment of the WNC . But most groups represented at the conference appeared to favor passing the bills once improvements are made . <p> The conference also discussed mechanisms to implement constitutional provisions enshrining women 's rights . <p> Details have not been finalized , but several proposals were made for gender advisory councils to coordinate women 's interests in various ministries .. <p> " Women 's organizations , whether in the church , politics , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people 's interests - social agents - but rarely agents of their own interests as people and as women , " says Mamphela Ramphele , a medical doctor and deputy vice chancellor of the University of Cape Town , in an opening address to the WNC conference . <p> " It is my considered opinion that a vibrant women 's movement is not in evidence in South Africa , " said Dr. Ramphele . " The Women 's National Coalition is the first such an effort . " <p> The issue of political independence was raised during one of the workshops held at the conference that was exploring mechanisms for ensuring that constitutional commitments to equality were carried through . <p> During the discussion , Ms. Simms advised delegates to make sure that enforcement agencies were staffed by women without party political affiliations . <p> " Women committed to women 's issues are always better than a party hack , " she said . <p> This proved to be a challenging assertion at a conference where most women had become involved in women 's issues as a result of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet achieved clarity in my own mind regarding the need for the women 's movement to be nonpolitical , " said Nomzizwe Madlala , whose involvement with the black consciousness philosophy in the early 1980s helped her find her identity and deal with whites as equals . " I would not allow my party to shackle me in the striving for the emancipation of women , but I am not saying that we can not work together , " she said . <p> Black women have borne the brunt of suffering under the apartheid system and the added legacy of traditional African customs and laws which assume the subservient role of women . <p> Most prominent of these practices are polygamy and the system of lobola , whereby the parents of the prospective husband must pay a dowry to the bride 's parents . <p> In terms of traditional law , African women are subject to the guardianship of their customary law husbands ( as many as 50 percent of rural African marriages are customary - civil , not legal ) , which places them in a position of perpetual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position of having to strive for formal equality within the system of customary law , " Professor June Sinclair , deputy Vice-Chancellor of Witwatersrand University said . <p> Many black women are also reluctant to confront these traditional practices . But there is a growing awareness that they are fundamental to the emancipation of African women . <p> " We need to identify which cultural practices are obstacles to the emancipation of women , " Ms. Madlala said . <p> " We certainly have to be aware of the patriarchal nature of traditional society , but I do n't think you can sweep aside everything that is traditional , " said Madlala , a married mother of two whose political involvement in the liberation struggle led her to the women 's movement . <p> White women have fought a protracted battle against sex discrimination and have been largely successful in achieving formal equality . <p> But they are poorly represented in some key professional sectors , and some women 's groups advocate affirmative action in the form of a quota system . <p> " I do n't believe in the quota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights campaigner who was the lone voice of the liberal Progressive Party in the whites-only Parliament for more than a decade . <p> Mrs. Suzman , an active participant at the conference , advocated direct participation for women in top government decisionmaking bodies as the most effective means of sustaining pressure for gender equality . <p> Black women , who have expended much of their energy trying to hold together families broken apart by apartheid practices , like migrant labor and forced relocations , have made impressive headway in the economic sector . <p> They account for 26 percent of black managers compared with white women who constitute 19 percent of white managers . <p> Women make up 41 percent of the economically active population , but earn on average only 70 percent of men 's earnings . <p> Although women account for 54 percent of the South African population , their representation in political decisionmaking , national forums , and negotiations for a democratic settlement in South Africa is usually under 10 percent . Few women in power <p> There is only one woman in the ruling National Party Cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are only a handful of women in the white-dominated Parliament in Cape Town . <p> There is only one woman in the National Working Committee of the African National Congress ( ANC ) and none among the six national office bearers . There are only 12 women in the ANC 's 88-person executive committee . <p> But the major challenge for South African women in the years ahead will be eliminating the legacy of apartheid . <p> " It will require much communication and contact to bring back the self-respect that has been taken away from black women so that they will be able to see white women as their equals , " said Madlala.
