Yo Ms. My issue ( November/December 1996 ) just arrived and I have n't even had time to open it , but I must rush my compliments to you on that fantastic cover . It 's your best evera truly fresh and brash face of 1990s feminism . Keep those forward-looking images coming ! Deborah A. Wallace ( an " older " feminist of 45 ! ) Kirkland , Wash . I initially bought your magazine for the wonderful cover story on Ani DiFranco . However , I ended up devouring it cover to cover . I particularly like that it is ad free . My new aspiration in life is to be a feminist ! Mark Barbeau San Francisco , Calif . I first discovered Ms. through my women 's studies class . I only wish I had known about it sooner . I am a senior in college , and I feel that Ms. is a great portal into the " real world . " The articles are full of helpful and empowering information . Being a biology major , I especially appreciate the health section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the survey from the November/December 1996 issue . My main suggestion is that Ms. continue to work hard at reaching out to college women . . Stephanie Smith Des Moines , Iowa Ani Rules As a young woman , I often do not feel represented in your pages , but the November/December 1996 issue made me feel that I was able to relate when I saw Ani DiFranco grinning at me from the cover , as well as when I read Dar Williams ' comments ( " A Feminist at the Video Store " ) and Veronica Chambers ' contribution ( " Family Ties : Lessons from Teens in Foster Care " ) . The interview with Ani DiFranco ( " Woman on the Verge , " by Ellen Papazian ) was great . Her music touches women in a more serious way than that of most other musicians , and her fans are more than just the average groupies . It 's too bad that a happy equilibrium of giving has not been found as yet , but I have no doubt that her fans are grrrl enough to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. made what I feel to be a pretty significant mistake . In reviewing Alice Munro 's newest book , Selected Stories , you state that Munro has only one novel out to date . Sorry , Ms.-she 's got at least five books out . Just thought I should let you know . Ray Berger Montreal , Que. , Canada Editors ' Note : Munro has published nine books , but only one of them is a novel ; the rest are collections of short stories . I admire Ani DiFranco very much as an artist and a role model , and it saddens me to hear of the unfair and rather vicious treatment of her by some fans . For me her attraction has always been her everyone-else-be-damned independence coupled with incredible musical talent . It is ludicrous that she is now being attacked for making her own life choices and for expanding musically . DiFranco is an artist-her music has always been the vehicle of her activism . Women should not attack her for using that same tool to explore her personal lifethis is , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mold they have tried to place her in , they should accept that she has always resisted any form of categorization . I would also suggest that these fans should ultimately look to women such as Cecilia Rodriguez ( Uppity Women ) and Cicih Sukaesih ( Newsmaker ) who were also featured in your issue rather than to a singer for inspiration . These two women , to use DiFranco 's words , " do n't get applause at the end of the day . " Rebekka Grella Brooklyn , N.Y . I do n't understand why people are being so harsh on Ani DiFranco . We knew all along that she was bisexual . And dykes , of all people , should understand the importance of the freedom of ( sexual ) choice . She has the right to live her life as she chooses . Kindly allow the womyn to live her life : it is hers , not ours . Chris Spain Aurora , N.Y . When I saw Ani DiFranco on the cover my heart leapt . ( Yes , leapt-I am still a teenager wowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insightful article that explored her thoughts on issues concerning women , politics , our society , her experiences as a feminist , businesswoman , activist , and musician . What I ended up with was another piece on how hard it is to be an indie . If I had wanted the same trite , redundant angle I would 've read Rolling Stone . Ms. was the last magazine in which I expected to find such tunnel vision . Desaray Smith College Park , Md . Thank you very much for featuring one of my favorite musicians on the cover . Usually I page through the entire magazine slowly when I first receive it , but this time I dove right in to the feature on Ani DiFranco . Do n't worry , Ani , there are plenty of us out here who love you just the way you are . Rock on ! Sara J. Marhenke South Padre Island , Tex . I was thrilled when I saw Ani DiFranco on the cover , but after reading the article , I was n't sure if I wanted to know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I listen to her music nonstop , when tempted to " worship " her , I remind myself to put more energy into me . That is the essence of the music , not worshiping DiFranco starry-eyed or worrying about the love life and clothes of your favorite rocker ! Erin Sexton Hawthorn Woods , Ill . On the Radio Thanks for the great piece " The Sound of Silence : Where Are the Feminists in Talk Radio ? " by Laura Flanders ( November/December 1996 ) . I am on WPHT , which is 1210 AM in Philadelphia , a 50,000-watt station going up and down the entire East Coast . We are a CBS/Westinghouse station , and I have complete freedom to say whatever I want . I have done shows on " Why Is Liberal a Dirty Word ? " and " The True First Wives ' Club , " namely Mrs. Rush Limbaugh , Mrs. Newt Gingrich , Mrs. Dick Armey , Mrs. Robert Dole , and Mrs. Ronald Reagan . And I have been called the " I " word on a number of occasions ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sure there are a lot of us out there , just not as famous as the ones you cited . Do n't give up-our numbers are growing . Lynne Z. Gold-Bikin Philadelphia , Pa . Thank you very much for listing WINGS ( Women 's International News Gathering Service ) in Laura Flanders ' article . But please , WINGS does n't belong to Pacifica . We 're an independent , woman-owned international network .

Box 33220 , Austin , Tex . 78764 . Frieda Werden Austin , Tex . The most valuable lesson my late mother taught me was to firmly believe that I could be anything I wanted to be . That became the basis of my operative definition of feminism . I am saddened and disheartened when I read articles like Laura Flanders ' , which reflect agenda-based guidelines of how women-asfeminists should think , including how we should measure the success of women in radio . Flanders has n't listened to Laura Schlessinger , or she would know that Dr. Laura is n't a " therapistentertainer . " Yes , Schlessinger supports a pretty conservative " agenda , " but she is a beautiful example of feminism . She thinks for herself , has the courage of her convictions , and encourages women to have the courage of their own . It does women a disservice , and feeds right into Rush Limbaugh 's tirades , to present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tex . NorplantWho Gets Stuck ? I was happy to find an article in your November/December 1996 issue on the Norplant controversy ( " The Misuses of Norplant : Who Gets Stuck ? " by Jennifer Washburn ) . One year ago I was a resident volunteer at a homeless shelter for women . I often had discussions with the women about birth control methods , pregnancy , et cetera , and it seemed as though some of the residents were more educated about the possible side effects of various contraceptives , including Norplant , than I was . One young African American woman explained how gynecologists and social service workers push welfare recipients to use Norplant . She had heard about its side effects and had decided that she was not going to be a guinea pig for gynecologists , the government , and the contraceptive industry . But has n't Washburn whitewashed her story by portraying Su Juan Fields as the average Norplant user ? And what about Su Juan Fields ? Early in the article Washburn says that Fields is a Medicaid recipient , but her story never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors often will not remove the rods , and she gives statistics and research data . But Washburn does not tell us why Fields 's health care providers would not remove the rods . It is almost as if Washburn is trying to use the experience of one poor black woman to warn white , middle-class women ( who are the primary readers of this magazine , whether you like it or not ) about Norplant . The writer exploits Fields ' experience and does not even do justice to the real story . " Who gets stuck ? " really means " How white women can avoid getting stuck . " If Ms. wants more black readers , it has to attend to these issues rather than gloss over the real story in order to make it readable for your white audience . Tokenism is not inclusion ! Marie J. Fritz New York , N.Y . I was very troubled by the paternalistic tone of the article on Norplant . It appeared to assume that poor women were " duped " into using Norplant and , more important , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will not pay for as well as the ability to plan ahead and make intelligent , rational choices . All insurance has limits on what it pays for . As a rational actor , I have an obligation to myself to find out which services are provided and which are not . So why should n't women on public assistance ask the same questions as those of us who buy insurance and make informed choices ? The article seems to be part of a certain left-leaning liberalism that always assumes that someone else knows better than the poor and downtrodden . We should encourage women and others to act on their own behalf instead of assuming we know what is best and right for them . We should also encourage poor women to understand that they are capable of and should make informed choices-that means taking responsibility for understanding both your insurance and your health care and asking the questions necessary . People get selfesteem and power through learning how to ask questions and make informed decisions . Belinda Friis Ann Arbor , Mich . Editors ' Note : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years on the controversy surrounding Norplant and the concerns of many activists about its long-term health effects as well as its misuses . Un fortunately , many of the most troubling problems have involved the practice of steering women on public assistance to this contraceptive , often giving them little or no choice , or incomplete and misleading information . This article was written as a follow-up to these stories and simply indicates that this policy of pushing Norplant on poor women continues . Connections I was moved by Jane Poindexter 's piece " Anatomy of a Friendship " ( November/December 1996 ) about both her friendship with Toni Cade Bambara and Bambara 's death from cancer . The story was honest , at a level I felt in my gut , and universal-about the nature of friendships , creativity , dysfunctionality , and death . Thanks for great work ! Grete Viddal Leverett , Mass . Up in Smoke While appreciating the variety of viewpoints articulated in " Tobacco Stains , " by Sharon Lerner ( November/ December 1996 ) , I could n't help noticing that the accompanying illustrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did an adequate job of depicting several races ( among the picketers and graduates could be discerned Caucasians , African Americans , and Asians ) , she failed miserably in portraying a similar diversity of somatotype . The elite blending of extensive lashes , juicy lips , pouty breasts , and ectomorphic builds made these women look as though they 'd been constructed from a Barbie mold rather than drawn from a sample of the general population . Warning : Sandra 's Slims can be every bit as insidious , addictive , and damaging to women as Virginia 's . G. Leenders Hamilton , Ont. , Canada Sharon Lerner presented a fairly honest overview of the problems women 's groups have when deciding to take contributions from questionable sources such as tobacco companies . I did find a few things that bothered me in this article . One in particular is that smoking cigarettes was never presented as yet another choice that Americans have to make . Surely , we all know the dangers of smoking . Taking money from tobacco companies is no more risky than taking contributions from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ford Motor Company cares about us ? They all just want our money , and we have to stop blaming only the obvious ones . Marie Baldridge Baltimore , Md . One Vote Barbara Ehrenreich 's " Why I Did n't Vote for Clinton " ( November/December 1996 ) immediately jumped out at me from the table of contents . As so often happens when I read Ms. , I was grateful and refreshed to see so much of myself there on the pages . In 1992 , with the specter of more Bush appointments to the Supreme Court looming grimly before me , I too voted for Bill while holding my nose . This time around , however , I , like Ehrenreich , found that I could n't do it again , and so voted from my conscience rather than from a lesser-of-two-evils position . It is difficult to negotiate that fine line between idealism and pragmatism as we struggle to articulate and create our visions for social change . However , we need to refuse to succumb to the pressures to quash our visions and our spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriarchy has devised . Voting for Ralph Nader did n't make me feel like I was throwing my vote away . In fact , I felt that my ballot was much more powerful than a vote for Clinton , because it was more truly my vote than a forced choice . Carrie L. Anderson New Orleans , La . It 's too bad that your November/December 1996 issue did n't arrive in time for women to read Ehrenreich 's " Opinion " prior to Election Day . I 'll bet many more women would have voted-as Ehrenreich and I did-for Ralph Nader , the only honest candidate . As a member of the County Democratic Central Committee of San Luis Obispo County , for a year I watched with dismay while my male and male-dominated colleagues beat the Clinton drum from the bandwagon and never questioned the direction of the parade . Thanks , Barbara Ehrenreich , for describing so succinctly just why I 've been seething with rage during the past two years . Now it 's time for : Do n't get mad , just get even . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luis Obispo , Calif . I was appalled at Ehrenreich 's boast that she would vote for Ralph Nader ( what are his positions on feminism , violence against women , and abortion , as well as lesbian/ gay rights ? ) . What if Dole had been elected ? What would have happened to affirmative action and equal rights once he got through appointing Supreme Court justices ? What would have happened to new funding for battered women 's shelters , which was insufficient during the Reagan/Bush reign ? As a director of a battered women 's shelter , I voted for the candidate more likely to keep the doors open for women with no refuge from violence . And since when is being pro-choice something to be trivialized ? Maybe some of you have the luxury of a protest vote , but as a lesbian I am compelled to vote for the candidate who will do the best job of preventing me from losing my job , or my home , or my children . There was a major difference between the two candidates ( as Gloria Steinem brilliantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected makes a phenomenal difference in the daily lives of women in this country . Many of us who supported President Clinton were not looking for influence or access-we were seeking survival . Susan McGee Saline , Mich . NOW Rebuts In the November/December 1996 issue Barbara Ehrenreich nudged me in the ribs for behaving " like such a lady " at the Democratic convention , and Sharon Lerner 's examination of women 's groups and tobacco money said NOW " avoids the question " by refusing corporate contributions . Unladylike as it may be to point out , NOW is not that passive . After leading protests outside the White House , my 24 hours in Chicago at the Democratic Convention were spent pressing administration officials to soften the welfare law 's impact by encouraging states to implement its optional Family Violence Amendment , an approach we 're still advocating . We 're also distributing a new video-funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionthat links tobacco , alcohol , and fashion advertising with women 's health problems . This combination of protests , negotiations , and collaborations is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean we accept access at the expense of real political influence-no matter how ladylike we may look on any given day . Patricia Ireland President National Organization for Women ( NOW ) Washington , D.C. More Than Semantics I have been reading your fine publication for most of its existence and have depended on it to keep me informed . I am usually delighted and stimulated by the content , but I do have one request . Would you please stop perpetuating the idea that only physicians are able to prescribe medications and treatments ! There are several categories of health professionals who depending on state laws are legally able to prescribe or give medications to patients . Among them are nurse midwives , nurse anesthetists , physician assistants , and nurse practitioners . The use of the term " health care provider " avoids the problem of having to list every category each time you refer to someone who is able to render care . As you are an organization whose very name is a reflection of your understanding of the impact of semantics , I hope you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know I 'm going to catch some hell for this , but I found the profile of clinical social worker and family therapist Marianne AultRiche ( Health Profile , November/December 1996 ) just a tad disturbing . Ault-Riche is quoted as saying , " Even the most liberated men do n't have a clue about really sharing household labor . " While I am certain that by and large ( and I mean a large by and a very large large ) her statement is accurate , it is n't possible that there is actually no man in the entire world who has a clue about sharing household labor . My point would be no more than nitpicking except that Ault-Riche is bringing this bias , however understandable , to her family therapy practice . I ca n't imagine why anyone who wishes to work out their domestic problems would go to a therapist with any built-in bias , and I am appalled that any therapist would be so proud of such a bias as to proclaim it in a national publication . Thanks for producing such an astounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail , and the only one I read cover to cover . I save every issue and plan to pass them on to our children as an alternative to the history , news , and social studies that they will be exposed to at school and in the media . Brian Ashley St. Paul , Minn . Film Picks Your review of great movies ( " A Feminist at the Video Store " by Jill Petty , November/December 1996 ) gave me quite a few more titles to check out . But none of your reviewers mentioned a movie that has had a great impact on my generation : Star Wars . Before this movie , who ever heard of a princess who could throw herself down a garbage chute , while saying , " What kind of a rescue is this ? " Or one who would put aside her personal grief to continue a crusade for social and political change ? She definitely served as a role model for inner strength while I grew up . Unfortunately , the Princess Leia of the last two movies in the trilogy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard time reconciling Leia as rebel leader in the first movie and Leia as a grotesque monster 's sex toy in the third . My ideas for doctoral dissertations have run along the lines of " The Rise and Decline of Public Opinion Concerning the Feminist Movement as Seen Though the Star Wars Trilogy , " ever since high school . Anyway , your magazine kicks ass , and your articles on politics and relationships ( and Ani DiFranco ) have given me informed stances on some of the issues with which I am currently grappling . Keep up the good work ! Catherine M. Cavanagh Boston , Mass . Separate But . . . " Will VMI Be Used Against Us ? " by Carol Sanger ( November/December 1996 ) asks : " Can one support the admission of four female ' knobs ' to The Citadel and SO seventh-grade girls to the new Young Women 's Leadership School in New York City 's East Harlem ? " The Board of the New York City Chapter of the National Organization for Women , after much thought and discussion , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school violates local and federal antidiscrimination law . It also flies in the face of the public education mandate to develop a literate population able to transcend historical barriers based on race and gender . A sexsegregated school does not teach or promote tolerance , multiculturalism , or sex equity in schools or in society . Carol Sanger points out that segregation may help girls ' self-esteem and make them " better prepared for the coeducational world . " It is true that , as she says , " coeducation in our culture does not always provide girls with equality of opportunity envisioned by equal protection . " Though proposed as such , the Young Women 's Leadership School is not a solution , but a Band-Aid approach to educational equity for girls . In fact , it deflects attention and energies from improving the school system for all girls . Sanger writes , " Celebrating the VMI decision is . . . a complicated proposition for those who also believe that women 's traditional inferiorities ' might at times be cured , not created , by single-sex schools for girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school will be a cure for biases of any kind . Single-sex schools may help the selfconfidence and improve the educational opportunities for the handful of girls who attend , but on a societal level , they reinforce gender stereotypes and boys ' perceptions that the classroom is their clubhouse . Rather than discouraging sexist attitudes and behavior in teachers and in boys , it rewards them . Nor does taking boys out of the classroom automatically eliminate sexism in the classroom . We need to remember that historically , our foremothers like Susan B. Anthony had to fight for the establishment of coed schools . The Young Women 's Leadership School in Harlem is a giant step backward for girls , women , and the feminist movement .

We were best friends in high school and more like sisters than anything else . I 'm writing to Ms. because I 'm almost certain she is still a reader and probably has a subscription to the magazine .

Claiming Our Mothers ' Names Camille Minichino 's tonguein-cheek lament , " A Name of His Own , " about her husband 's decision not to take her name when they married , is a perfect answer to this dilemma ( November/December 1996 ) . I suggest we take it further . I would like to see mothers , having kept their maiden names , then take the next step and name their daughters after themselves . Thereby all women would be named after their mothers and grandmothers . By refusing to break our name connection to our past , we too could demonstrate our pride in our own heritage .
