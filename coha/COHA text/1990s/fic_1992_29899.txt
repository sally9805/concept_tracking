Life Dear Editor , The sweat was dripping down my face and into my lap , making my clothes very wet and sticky . I sat there , walking , watching . I was trembling violently as I sat , looking at the small slot , waitingever waiting . My nails dug into my flesh as I clenched my hands . I passed my arm over my hot , wet face , down which sweat was pouring . The suspense was unbearable . I bit my lip in an attempt to stop trembling with the terrible burden of anxiety . Suddenly , the slot opened and in dropped the mail . I grabbed at my Eagle and ripped off the wrapping paper . My ordeal was over for another week ! D. N. Adams ( 12 ) , Brentwood , Essex , January 23 , 1965 , Eagle and Boys ' World Magazine Editor 's Note : In the sixties The Eagle was an enormously popular English science-fiction magazine . This letter is the first known published work of Douglas Adams , then age twelve . The Voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were what was going on in the background while I was trying to listen to the Beatles . When " Ca n't Buy Me Love " came out , I was twelve . I sneaked out of school during morning milk break , bought the record , and broke into matron 's room because she had a record player . Then I played it , not loud enough to get caught , but just loud enough to hear with my ear pressed up against the speaker . Then I played it again for the other ear . Then I turned the record over and did the same for " You Ca n't Do That . " That was when the housemaster found me and put me into detention , which is what I had expected . It seemed a small price to pay for what I now realize wasart . I did n't know it was art then , of course . I only knew that the Beatles were the most exciting thing in the universe . It was n't always an easy view to live with . First you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they fought dirty and had their knuckles nearer the ground . Then you had to fight the grownups , parents and teachers who said that you were wasting your time and pocket money on rubbish that you would have forgotten by next week . I found it hard to understand why they were telling me this . I sang in the school choir and knew how to listen for harmony and counterpoint , and it was clear to me that the Beatles were something extraordinarily clever . It bewildered me that no one else could hear it : impossible harmonies and part playing you had never heard in pop songs before . The Beatles were obviously just putting all this stuff in for some secret fun of their own , and it seemed exciting to me that people could have fun in that way . The next exciting thing was that they kept on losing me . They would bring out a new album and for a few listenings it would leave me cold and confused . Then gradually it would begin to unravel itself in my mind . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was listening to Something that was simply unlike anything that anybody had done before . " Another Girl , " " Good Day Sunshine , " and the extraordinary " Drive My Car . " These tracks are so familiar now that it takes a special effort of will to remember how alien they seemed at first to me . The Beatles were now not just writing songs , they were inventing the very medium in which they were working . I never got to see them . Difficult to believe , I know . I was alive at the time the Beatles were performing and never got to see them . I tend to go on about this rather a lot . Do not go to San Francisco with me , or I will insist on pointing out Candlestick Park to you and bleating on about the fact that in 1966 the Beatles played their last concert there , just shortly before I 'd woken up to the fact that rock concerts were things you could actually go to , even if you lived in Brentwood . A friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see David Frost 's show being recorded , but we ended up not going . I watched the show that night , and the Beatles were on it playing " Hey Jude . " I was ill for about a year . Another day that I happened not to go to London after all was the day they played their rooftop concert in Savile Row . I can't-ever-speak about that . Well , the years passed . The Beatles passed . But Paul McCart-ney has gone on and on . A few months ago the guitarist Robbie McIntosh phoned me and said , " We 're playing at the Mean Fiddler in a few days , do you want to come along ? " Now this is one of the daftest questions I 've ever been asked , and I think it took me a few moments even to work out what he meant . The Mean Fiddler , for those who do n't know , is a pub in an unlovely part of northwest London with a room at the back where bands play . You can probably get about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that temporarily confused me , because I knew that the band that Robbie was currently playing in was Paul McCartney 's , and I did n't think that Paul McCartney played in pubs . If Paul McCartney did play in pubs , then it would be daft to think that I would not saw my own leg off in order to go . I went . In front of two hundred people in a pub , Paul McCartney stood up and played songs he 'd never , I think , played in public before . " Here , There and Everywhere " and " Blackbird , " to name but two . I 've played " Blackbird " in pubs , for heaven 's sake . I spent weeks learning the guitar part when I was supposed to be revising for A-levels . I almost wondered if I was hallucinating . There were two moments of complete astonishment . One was the last encore , which was an immaculate , thunderous performance of , believe it or not , " Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . " ( Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other was one of the world 's greatest rock ' n ' roll songs , " Ca n't Buy Me Love , " which I had first heard crouching with my ear cupped to the Dansette record player in the school matron 's room . There is a game people like to play that goes , " When would you most like to have lived and why ? " The Italian Renaissance ? Mozart 's Vienna ? Shakespeare 's England ? Personally , I would like to have been around Bach . But I have a real difficulty with the game , which is that living at any other period of history would have meant missing the Beatles , and I honestly do n't think I could do that . Mozart and Bach and Shakespeare are always with us , but I grew up with the Beatles and I 'm not sure what else has affected me as much as that . So Paul McCartney is fifty tomorrow . Happy birthday , Paul . I would n't have missed it for the world . The London Sunday Times , June 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve whole years . And they were , by and large , in an up and downy kind of way , pretty good years : fairly happy , reasonably leafy , a bit sportier than I was in the mood for at the time , but full of good ( and sometimes highly eccentric ) teaching . In fact , it was only later that I gradually came to realise how well I had been taught at Brentwoodparticularly in English , and particularly in Physics . ( Odd , that . ) However , the whole twelve-year experience is , for me , completely overshadowed by the memory of one terrible , mind-scarring experience . I am referring to the episode of The Trousers . Let me explain . I have always been absurdly , ridiculously tall . To give you an ideawhen we went on school expeditions to Interesting and Improving Places , the form-master would n't say " Meet under the clock tower , " or " Meet under the War Memorial , " but " Meet under Adams . " I was at least as visible as anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . When , in Physics , we were asked to repeat Galileo 's demonstration that two bodies of different weight fall to the ground at the same speed , I was the one who was given the task of dropping the cricket ball and the pea , because it was quicker than going to an upstairs window . I always towered over everybody . Right back at the very beginning of my school career , aged seven , I introduced myself to another new boy ( Robert Neary ) by coming up behind him and , in a spirit of experiment , dropping a cricket ball on his head and saying , " Hello , my name 's Adams , what 's yours ? " This , for Robert Neary , I 'm sure was his one terrible , mind-scarring memory . In the Prep School , where I was for five years out of my twelve , we all wore short trousers : grey shorts with blazers in the summer , and in the winter those pepper-and-salt tweed suits with short trousers . There is of course an extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in the depths of an English winter ( and they were colder then , were n't they ? ) . According to Wired magazine , we ca n't expect to see self-repairing fabrics until about the year 2020 , but ever since we emerged from whatever trees or swamps we lived in five million years ago , we have had self-repairing knees . So , shorts made sense . Even though we all had to wear them , it did begin to get a bit ridiculous in my case . It was n't towering over the other boys I minded so much , it was towering over the masters . Wearing shorts . My mother pleaded with the principal on one occasion to please make an exception in my case and let me wear long trousers . But Jack Higgs , ever fair but firm , said no : I was only six months away from going up to the main school , whereupon I , along with everybody else , would be able to wear long trousers . I would have to wait . At last I left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Michaelmas term , my mother took me along to the school shop to buyat lasta long-trousered school suit . And guess what ? They did n't make them in a size long enough for me . Let me just repeat that , so that the full horror of the situation can settle on you reading this as it did on me that day in the summer of 1964 , standing in the school shop . They did n't have any school trousers long enough for me . They would have to make them specially . That would take six weeks . Six weeks . Six minus two was , as we had been so carefully and painstakingly taught , four . Which meant that for four whole weeks of the next term I was going to be the only boy in school wearing shorts . For the next two weeks I took up playing in the traffic , being careless with kitchen knives , and neglecting to stand clear of the doors on station platforms , but , sadly , I led a charmed life , and I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humiliation and embarrassment known to man or , rather , to that most easily humiliated and embarrassed of all creatures , the overgrown twelve-year-old boy . We 've all experienced those painful dreams in which we suddenly discover we are stark naked in the middle of the high street . Believe me , this was worse , and it was n't a dream . The story rather fizzles out there because a month later , of course , I got my long trousers and was readmitted into polite society . But , believe me , I still carry the scars inside , and though I try my best to bestride the world like a Colossus , writing best-selling books and . . . ( well , that 's about it , really , I suppose ) , if I ever come across as a maladjusted , socially isolated , sad , hunched emotional cripple ( I 'm thinking mainly of Sunday mornings in February , here ) , then it 's those four weeks of having to wear short trousers in September 1964 that are to blame . Y " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an entire letter of the alphabet named after it . The alphabet does not go " A B C D What ? When ? How ? " but it does go " V W X Why ? Z. " " Why ? " is always the most difficult question to answer . You know where you are when someone asks you " What 's the time ? " or " When was the battle of 1066 ? " or " How do these seatbelts work that go tight when you slam the brakes on , Daddy ? " The answers are easy and are , respectively , " Seven-thirty-five in the evening , " " Ten-fifteen in the morning , " and " Do n't ask stupid questions . " But when you hear the word " Why ? , " you know you 've got one of the biggest unanswerables on your hands , such as " Why are we born ? " or " Why do we die ? " and " Why do we spend so much of the intervening time receiving junk mail ? " Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " " Why ? " There 's only ever been one good answer to that question " Why ? " and perhaps we should have that in the alphabet as well . There 's room for it . " Why ? " does n't have to be the last word , it is n't even the last letter . How would it be if the alphabet ended , " V W X Why ? Z , " but " V W X Why not ? " Do n't ask stupid questions . From Hockney 's Alphabet ( Faber &; Faber )
