Kitty Kelley , who has compiled best-selling and decidedly unauthorized biographies of Jacqueline Onassis , Elizabeth Taylor and Frank Sinatra , will next month finish the manuscript of her life of Nancy Reagan . And , after four years of work and some 900 interviews , the tattletale author is worried about  --  of all things  --  leaks to gossip columnists . Editors at Simon &; Schuster , which paid a reported $3 million advance for the book , have naturally been eager to look at chapters as Kelley completed them . Fearful that contents might get out , she has refused to send any portion of the manuscript to Manhattan . Instead , S &S; editors have regularly shuttled to Washington , where they have perused pages in Kelley 's Georgetown living room and then gone back to Manhattan empty-handed . Once she submits her final version , the author is at the mercy of Manhattan 's notorious literary gossip . The book is scheduled to appear in the fall of 1991  --  although details may well hit print a lot earlier .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
