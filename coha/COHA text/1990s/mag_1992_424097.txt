Succulents make a fascinating , long-lasting alternative to evergreens <p> THE WORLD OF SUCCULENTS is a richly varied one . Within it one can find plants ranging in color from creamy white and rosy red to iridescent blue and the deepest of greens . Shapes are equally well represented , with everything from sturdy ovals and jewellike rosettes to delicate strings of hearts and beads . Some are tender , some are hardy , but by virtue of their innate capacity to store water and endure hardship , all are drought-tolerant and tough , making them ideal candidates for cultivation indoors and out . <p> Teddy Colbert , a gardener and writer from Los Angeles , California , likes to characterize succulents as " survivors " because of their ability to regenerate under severe conditions . " Unlike a daisy or a rose , " she says , " if you cut them off from their life support , then give them a little bit of time to heat , they 'll start to put out new roots . They want to live . " <p> Colbert 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given seemingly unrelated challenge in a class she was taking : Design an original plant container . Although uncertain at first how to handle the assignment , she soon recalled the huge , candle-studded wreaths she had seen gracing medieval halls in Europe . Would it be possible , she wondered , to re-create those wreaths on a smaller scale , or better still , to make one that would last year after year ? <p> As she pondered the idea and discussed it with her instructor , Colbert realized she could accomplish her goal by making a sturdy , decorative support on which to grow succulents . As others had done before tier , she started her experiments with a chicken-wire base stuffed with sphagnum moss , then replaced the chicken wire with two premade half-frames tied together . To avoid having to fertilize the plants continuously , she decided to add a core of soil to the frames , giving the plants a solid place in which to root and draw nutrients . Eventually she went on to refine the frame itself , designing a one-piece base of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better aeration , but is versatile enough to be set horizontally on a table , hung vertically on a wall , or even suspended as a candelabrum . The patented frame is now the basis of her thriving mail-order business , through which she sells finished wreaths , cuttings , and hardware to those interested in constructing their own wreaths . <p> Naturally , Colbert has also experimented over the years with various methods of planting the frames . It is , she believes , mostly a matter of propagation . Given these plants ' propensity for regeneration , propagation is not difficult , particularly if you know the growth habits of the species you are dealing with . Most succulent cuttings will regenerate quickly if given a few days to callus over ; those that are n't given this time or are mistakenly placed in water will rot rather than root . <p> For wreathmaking , Colbert has found it best to use plants that are compact in order to maintain the aesthetic effect you desire . jades , such as Crassula ovata ' Crosby 's Compact ' , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuttings " because even the leaves will root . " Sedums and sempervivums are also easy to come by , whether gathered from the garden or purchased from a nursery . Those that multiply readily work best . Of course wreaths will be most successful if they combine plants with similar light and temperature requirements , but Colbert notes that it Is important to have some variation in color and texture as well . Echeverias , with their rosettes of foliage , make excellent , low-growing accent plants , while cascaders such as donkey 's tail ( Sedum morganianum ' Burrito ' ) or Rhipsalis species ' I give hanging wreaths an extra will dimension . The possibilities for combinations are endless , although wreaths composed of only one or two varieties can look stunning . <p> " These wreaths are more than just living plants , " Colbert maintains . " They 're an art form . And because they 're an art form , they 're intensely personal . No two wreaths are alike , even if you and a friend each make one at the same time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propagating your selections , Colbert recommends taking cuttings about a week before you are ready to plant . Stems should be two to three inches long , with all broken , discolored , and lower foliage removed . Once the cuttings are made , Colbert places them in a single layer in a latticed nursery flat , which she then puts in a bright but indirectly lit spot with good ventilation . Thick-stemmed plants take about a week to callus over ; thin-stemmed ones take a day or two , depending on the climate and weather conditions . <p> Once the plants have developed calluses , you 'll need to set aside three or four hours for preparing and planting the wreath base . To make a wreath , you will need the following : a wreath frame , either purchased from Colbert or from a nursery ; a cubic foot or two of sphagnum moss ( not peat moss , which is shredded , or sheet moss , which is too thick ) ; one and a half gallons of standard potting mix ( not mix designed for cactus or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil for making planting holes and marking progress ; two S- hooks and a chain if you intend to hang the finished wreath ; and corks to plug candle holders during planting , if you want this option . ( For details on making and planting a wreath , see " Six Steps to a Succulent Wreath , " on page 36 . ) <p> After planting , keep the wreath on a flat surface for two to three weeks in order to give the plants time to root . ( Planting can cake place at any time of year , but rooting will take longer in colder weather . ) Gradually introduce the plants to direct sun and extremes of temperature . From then on , maintenance Is fairly simple . For watering , Colbert recommends what she calls the " loaf-of-fresh-bread " test . To conduct the test , squeeze the moss-covered frame from the back to determine whether it is hard on the outside , soft on the inside , " like a loaf of fresh bread , " or if it is hard throughout , " like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread , it requires a deep watering , which can be accomplished by soaking it In a large tub , dribbling it with a garden hose , or giving it drip irrigation with an intravenous bag ( available from Colbert ) . She says misting is not a good idea because it encourages shallow rooting . <p> Fertilizing should be minimal to keep growth compact . Colbert does n't fertilize wreaths for the first year , then uses liquid houseplant food at a quarter strength to keep plants strong and disease resistant . As the cuttings grow , prune them back to a pair of leaves if necessary , saving the prunings for future plantings . Colbert says pests are rarely a problem , but if insects should invade , try placing the wreath inside a sealed carton with the appropriate amount of mothballs per cubic foot elevated above the wreath in order to eradicate them . <p> If given proper care , your living succulent wreath should bring you joy-and compliments-year after year .

A 10-inch frame requires about 100 cuttings a 12-inch one , 175 . Use a sharp knife or pruning shears to cut specimens into two- to three-inch segments . Trim off broken , discolored , and bottom leaves , then spread cuttings in a single layer on a nursery flat to dry . Place the flat in an area with bright indirect light and good air circulation . Depending on the weather , thick-stemmed plants take about a week to callus over ; thin-stemmed ones a few days . Soak and drain the sphagnum moss in advance to make it easier to work with . Then spread a layer of moss three times the diameter of your wreath on a plastic-covered surface , growing side down . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas as necessary . Set the frame upside down in the center of the moss . If it has candle holders , plug them with corks , then mound dampened potting soil over the entire frame . If you plan to hang the wreath , attach one end of the chain to the crossbar with an Shook or opened link ; attach the other end after the frame is wrapped in moss . For this step , it 's best to enlist a friend 's help . Have your assistant carefully fold a portion of the MOSS up and over the frame while you slip the end of the copper wire beneath it and up through the center of the wreath . When you reach the top , twist the pieces of wire together to hold the moss firmly in place . Then mark the spot where the wire is with forceps or a pencil , and continue wrapping the frame , looping the wire around at three-quarter-inch intervals until the entire base is secured . Once this has been done , patch any holes or unevenness you may find in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting with the most inaccessible parts of the wreath ( the inner and outer curves ) and planting them with your chosen background plant . Place cuttings about a finger 's width apart in a single or double row . When you are through , the cuttings should resemble two rings upon a wreath . To insert the cuttings , make a hole slightly larger than the stem with forceps or a pencil , then gently insert the callused end of the stem into the moss until it touches the soil . Firm the moss around the cutting to protect it until it roots . After your base is established , you can have some fun with design . Colbert likes to start by choosing three accent specimens , which she places at strategic points around the front of the wreath . From there she composes groupings with an eye toward establishing pleasing combinations of color , texture , and shape . Here the medallionlike Semipervivum calcareum serves as the focal point of a grouping of black Aeonium arboreum ' Zwartkop ' , yellowgreen Sedum nulssbaumerianum , and donkey 's tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once you have finished planting , you can remove the corks from the candle holders ( if applicable ) and replace them with candles . Newly planted wreaths should be kept horizontal in a well-ventilated spot for several weeks to give cuttings a chance to get established . Gradually introduce the plants to direct sun and extremes of temperature , and give horizontal wreaths a quarter-turn on a regular basis to keep growth uniform .
