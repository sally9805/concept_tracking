For years he has been a walking  --  no , a running , jumping , slithering  --  suspension of disbelief . Not just on the basketball court , where he has all but remade the game and brought in a whole new dictionary to cover the moves that bear his monogram  --  the " no-look pass , " the " triple double , " the " coast to coast " drive . And not just in America , but from Bali to the Bahamas , where many kids wear his picture on their chests . Hundreds in Paris were calling out for " Ma-JEEK " when he went to play in France last month , and everyone was preparing for the unprecedented prospect of seeing him , the consummate professional , bring an amateur 's enthusiasm to the 1992 Olympics . <P> Even outside the world of sports , Mr. Showtime 's enormous smile and unquenchable grace have become almost ubiquitous  --  on music video shows , on billboards , at fund-raising dinners . For more than a decade , Earvin " Magic " Johnson Jr . has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an irreplaceable blend of poise and surprise . <P> Last week , however , Magic delivered what was clearly his most serious shock . At a press conference on the ground he has made his own , the Great Western Forum , home to the Los Angeles Lakers , Johnson , 6-ft. 9-in. tall and 32 years old , at the top of his career , announced that he had been infected by the human immune-deficiency virus ( HIV ) that causes AIDS and would " have to retire from the Lakers today . " Although he has as yet no symptoms of AIDS , the man who had defied gravity , and belief , for so long would suddenly , overnight , vanish from the court . " I 'm going to miss playing , " said Johnson , dry-eyed and dignified as ever , " but my life is going to go on . I 'm going to go on a happy man . " <P> The announcement left millions in a state of disbelief . It was not just a celebrity that was endangered by a life-threatening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and endurance had made him the most admired player in the world . " A situation like this just does n't make sense , " said Kevin McHale , Johnson 's longtime rival from the Boston Celtics . " When you look at a big , healthy guy like Magic Johnson , you think this illness would n't attack someone like him . But it did . " Many others were sobered at the thought that if even the most enchanted and mobile of bodies was vulnerable , it could , as Johnson pointed out , " happen to anybody . " Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , the thoughtful , soft-spoken 7-ft. 2-in. giant of the game , simply broke down and wept . <P> Yet Johnson 's characteristic refusal to be cowed , even by AIDS , suggested that the star might , as so often before , alchemize disaster with his infectious hopefulness . He was , after all , not unusual in contracting the virus , but he seemed to recognize that he was in an unusual position to campaign for protection against it . Vowing to become a spokesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use his plight to tell others that " safe sex is the way to go . " Just by his announcement , he began the process : calls to AIDS hot lines and testing centers more than doubled in most places the next day .
