How to fish with a bucket , fix your car with a plunger , clean a wound with urine  --  and more ! <p> PRETEND YOU 'RE a defenseless illegal immigrant to Earth , and you 're carjacked by seven beautiful lesbian superspy-killers on the New Jersey Turnpike who say they 're going to kill you , blow up Wall Street and Bobbitize every man in America unless you devise an ingenious way to plug their leaky radiator . <p> Quick ! What do you do ? You yell for a bathroom break , dash into the rest-stop restaurant , knock the cook unconscious and steal a raw egg . <p> Then you think back to your favorite 1980 's TV show MacGyver , remembering how in episode 41 , " The Bushmaster , " the world 's most resourceful man temporarily solved his own cooling-system conundrum by cracking an egg into the radiator , causing the white stuff to boil into a patch so he could get back to fighting bad guys and saving lives . You wow the carjacking Jills with your interstellar manhood for sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farfetched to some of you  --  especially you married guys . But , in fact , a man 's passage through life is just one crazy episode after another in which you , the hero , have to dodge daily emergencies using nothing more than a little brainpower and the trash you find along the highway of life . <p> To make like MacGyver , you need to know what to do when you 're ... LOST IN LIFE <p> Catch food with berries Some men fish with feathers , other men fish with worms , but Denis Boyles , author of The Lost Lore of a Man 's Life , uses Cocculus indicus ( the highly poisonous berry also known as " Levant nut " ) . Pulverize it , mix it with dough and scatter a few handfuls in still water where fish are . They will seize it voraciously , instantly become intoxicated and turn belly up on the water surface . Remove fish from water , deposit in frying pan . Cook . Eat . If instant lunch is n't on the menu , place the fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to . Do n't worry , this wo n't injure the fish , and you wo n't go belly-up yourself later . <p> Find north without a compass Poke a stick into the ground and angle it directly toward the sun so that it does n't cast a shadow . After a while , the sun will create a shadow that will point toward the east . Stand with the stick to your left-the shadow will point to your right-and draw a perpendicular line up and through the shadow . That 's north . <p> If there 's no sun , note the tops of pine trees ; they invariably dip to the north . <p> Make your own mirror A mirror is incredibly useful when you 're lost in the wilderness , since a plane traveling at 50,000 feet can see a mirror flashing 20 miles away on a clear day , and the pilot will know there 's some crazy guy down there in the middle of no place shaving , and he and the copilot will laugh about it all the way to Denver . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit card or jewelry . If these are n't available , whiz on a piece of flat wood . It will shine and act as a mirror . Not the kind you 'd use to check for nose hairs , but good enough to attract some attention . <p> Start a fire without matches No Bic ? No matches ? No flint ? Then chances are you 've got some steel wool and a battery , which is jake because that 's all you need . Roll the wool between your hands into a cigarette shape . Then pull the ends apart gently so there is only a fine mesh of steel wool in the center . Now touch one end to the battery 's top , the other to the battery 's bottom . Look at that ! The current makes the wool in the center spark and burn . Get an old insurance policy , touch some tinder to it and you 're talking arson . <p> Treat poison ivy If you know you 've had a brush with the three-leaved stuff , you have up to 30 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with soap and water . If soap 's not handy , look around for jewelweed ( or touch-me-not which counteracts poison ivy-and often grows nearby . Look for the little orange-and-yellow flowers and fat seed pods that burst when you touch them . Crush the stems and leaves and rub them on your skin . <p> Trick night crawlers Hey , your boss just tell you you 're an idiot ? Your wife laugh at your idea of a good idea ? Feel better fast by outwitting worms ! According to Jim Dwyer , editor of Practical Problem Solver , you can trick night crawlers into coming to the surface by pounding a small stake into the ground and rubbing another piece of wood vigorously across the top of it . The worms will be seduced by the vibrations . Scoop up a bucket of them , take them into the office , dump them on Mr. Bigg 's desk and say , " There ! You call that stupid ? ! " That 'll show him . <p> Escape quicksand Let 's say you 're walking along a woodland path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , current girlfriends and divorce lawyers ! Do n't panic . Just roll over : Simply turn onto your back and try to float . Then , with your arms and legs spread wide , slowly backstroke your way out of the quicksand . Do n't be in a mad rush , though ; quick , jerky movements will just suck you in deeper . <p> Remove a splinter Coat the splinter with a drop of glue-Elmer 's Glue-All is a good choice . When it dries , peel it off . The splinter should be stuck to it . Bonus tip : Do n't use Super Glue or you 'll not only remove the splinter , but also those telltale fingerprints . <p> Control cookout flames Keep a box of baking soda handy and sprinkle it on the coals to tame the flames , says Vicki Lansky , author of one of our favorite books , Baking Soda : Over 500 Fabulous , Fun and Frugal Uses . You can also prevent flare-ups by spreading lettuce leaves on the hot coals before you barbecue fatty meat . The lettuce will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say you 're out in the wilderness with your boss when he accidentally cuts himself . And let 's say there 's just no way to clean the wound . What would true followers of MacGyver do ? They 'd do what they do in the jungle of Manhattan 's West Village : Piss on it . " Urine is sterile , so this will dislodge debris and clean out the wound , " says William Forgey , M.D. , a general practitioner in Merillville , Indiana , and author of Wilderness Medicine . Just do n't miss and , like , squirt the guy in the face the way he did to you last time raises were handed out . PLAGUED BY PESTS <p> Exterminate fire ants If these nettlesome insects are causing a nuisance  --  and do you know a fire ant who is n't a nuisance ?  --  try sprinkling a handful of grits around the ant hole . At first , the fire ants will thank you and say , " Cool , you giant PETA-sucker ! " But then , slowly , the grits will expand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them fatter and fatter until eventually . . . well , you can imagine . The sound is like distant popcorn , with small screams . <p> Ca n't wait for the grits to work ? Then you should know that fire ants carry their queen to the top of the mound between 10 and 11 A.M. to take advantage of the morning rays . Pour boiling water on the anthill and you 'll kill the queen , destroying the colony . You heartless bastard . <p> Rid your barn of mice and rats Go to the hardware store and pick up a couple of rolls of duct tape . Fill a barrel or an oil drum halfway with water , then stretch a few pieces of the tape over the top of the barrel , about 8 inches apart . Rest a piece of paper across the strips and tape it firmly in place . Now place the barrel next to a table , shelf or other object that mice and rats can climb . Place food in the middle of the paper for five nights until the rodents look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get sloppy ! On the sixth night , cut an X in the paper with a razor . Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Nothing 's funnier than a tricked rat . The unsuspecting creatures will fall through the paper into the barrel . Take out the trash the next morning . <p> Relieve a sting Salve the pain of a bee attack by smoothing on a paste of water and baking soda . Not on the bee . On you . <p> Keep slugs from eating your produce If a legion of slugs is assaulting your lettuce , marigolds and potatoes  --  their faves  --  eradicate them with a few of these vicious options : <p> The most entertaining way : Buy a case of cheap beer . Pour a can of the beer into a pie plate . Now sit back with the other 23 cans , have yourself a few brewskis and watch the fun . By the time you come to , every slug in North America will be in the tin plate , dead , belly-up in the beer . A slug in a beer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to drink one of those ; trust us on this one . <p> Circle the plants you want to protect with copper . When the slugs attempt to slime across , the copper eats into them and they sizzle , writhe and die . Live as a slug , die as a slug . <p> Use your hair . Save the trimmings from the last visit to your barber , and sprinkle them around your garden . The unsuspecting slug will come in contact with the hair , at which point it will wrap around the slug and slowly kill it . " It 's an ugly death even if you hate slugs , " says Mike McGrath , former editor of Organic Gardening . " And the nitrogen in hair is good for plants . " Bonus : Hair also helps keep deer and rabbits out of your garden , since they ca n't stand the smell of you . <p> Get tough with pigeons Noisemakers ? Inflatable cats ? Forget about ' em . These flying rats are impervious to such tactics . Instead , run a strand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at about half the height of a pigeon 's breast ( about 2 inches ) . This halves the amount of usable space and will drive the pigeons crazy . Probably enough so they 'll go sit on your car or dump on a statue of the Martyred Suffragette . <p> Ground pesky flies Flies are sensitive to air currents , so rolling up a newspaper and swinging feverishly at these pests is a poor way to kill them . Instead , borrow your wife 's hair spray and shoot . It stiffens their wings and grounds them . HASSLED BY HARDWARE <p> Silence leaks Tie a 2-foot-long piece of string to the faucet and let the free end hang down into the drain . The water will run down the string . Whatever you do , do n't try shutting off the water under the sink , removing the fixture and replacing the washer . Much too much trouble , plus it takes maybe five minutes . <p> Unclog a drain One of the easiest and fastest ways to unclog a sink or your bathtub is to attach a hose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , wrap a rag around it to make a good seal . ( If there 's an overflow vent in the sink , cover that with a rag as well . ) Simply turn on the water or squeeze the handle on the nozzle slowly and you 'll have all the pressure you need to unclog the drain in seconds . <p> Level a picture To straighten that picture of the Founding Fathers , compare the top of the frame with the water level in a glass of water  --  it will always stay straight . <p> Slam-proof your doors Loop a piece of string around both doorknobs , avoiding the latch . When the door makes contact with the frame , the string will absorb the shock . Looks pretty , too . <p> Remove road tar WD-40 is the ultimate sprayable material . Spray WD-40 on a bad marriage , and it runs like a top . A bad audit coming up ? Get out those receipts and hose ' em down with WD-40 ; you 'll slide through untouched by the IRS . Got road tar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WD-40 . It 'll dissolve the tar without harming the paint . Let it sit a few minutes , then wipe with a soft rag . <p> Fix eyeglasses with fishing line It 's easy to get lost if you ca n't see where you 're going . So if you lose the little screw that holds an arm of your eyeglasses to its frame , knot one end of monofilament , then slip the other end through the screw hole and tie it . Melt both knots with a match to form a rivet . If your lens pops out : Hold the frame over a pot of boiling water . ( Take your glasses off first . ) The hot steam both softens the plastic and expands the lens opening . When the frame heat up , carefully ease the lens into place . The frame will contract around it as it cools to keep things tight . <p> Patch a leaky drainpipe In an emergency , slit a piece of rubber hose and wrap it around the pipe . Cover the hose with a metal sleeve made from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patch in place with a C-clamp buffered on each side by a block of wood . <p> Unlock your car door We know that even though you 're dumb enough to lock yourself out of the car , you 're smart enough to pop the hood , grab the oil dipstick , wipe it clean on your Armani trousers and insert the round end between the rubber door seal and the window . Move the dipstick around until you feel it catch the lock . Lift . There 's a learning curve here , so give it a little time . Remember , you 're working with the same brain that left the keys hanging from the ignition even as the little screaming alarm tried to warn you . <p> Unlock your house door If the door 's slammed but your wallet and keys are sitting next to the telephone , do n't panic . Simply climb over the neighbors ' fence , nod to the missus inside doing her workout  --  first time you 've seen that purple leotard , right ?  --  and head for their trash cans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2-liter variety works well ) . Grab a knife . Maybe your neighbor 's husband has one . Cut the bottom and top off the bottle and slice it down the middle . Then go back to your house , slide the curled piece of plastic along the side edge of the door while rattling and pulling the door toward you . It should open most locks . If the bevel faces the other way , fashion the plastic into an L-shape ? slide it behind the lock , then pull the plastic toward you . Or , you could sell the house . <p> Keep your keys afloat Next time you 're on a boating trip , attach your boat key to a large painted cork . " This way , if it falls overboard , it will stay afloat and be visible , " says Lansky . The same thing works with small dogs and wives , by the way . <p> Drive out of a snowbank Want to really leave ' em wondering ? Break into a nearby cabin and steal only the cat 's litter pan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watch out for the cat . <p> Remove a stubborn cork Two ways : If it 's cheap wine , bust off the neck and throw the wine away , because it 's ruined anyhow . If the stuff cost more than a buck or two , you can ease out the cork by dipping a cloth in very hot water and wrapping it around the neck of the bottle . The heat will expand the glass . It wo n't improve the wine . <p> Rescue film from a jammed camera If you 're on a trip and your camera jams , make your own darkroom with a dark-colored jacket or coat . Turn the coat inside out so your hands can slip through the ends of the sleeves . Then place it on the ground or on a table . Without removing your hands , place the camera inside and have someone pile clothes around the edges to further block out light . Open the camera , slowly remove the film , then rewind it by hand before pulling your arms out . <p> Contributors : Denis Boyles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jennifer Wilson <p> ( * ) DUCT TAPE NOT INCLUDED 12 SECRET WEAPONS <p> Here 's the complete inventory of the Purpose Hardware Store , where everyth need is under one weirdly patched roo PETROLEUM JELLY <p> Mask paint .
