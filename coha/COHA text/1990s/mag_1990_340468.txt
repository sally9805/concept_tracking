In New York City , where they never roll up the sidewalks , illegal social clubs are a long tradition . There are more than 1,000 such clubs strewn across the city 's five boroughs , dispensing cheap booze , loud music and a touch of the home country to immigrants . Many of them have something in common : the lack of a liquor license . All too many also offer their patrons something besides the prospect of a hot time on the town : the high risk of a fiery death . <P> The city 's law-enforcement bureaucracies have long been aware of the risks posed by the absence of anti-fire precautions at many social clubs . But the police , fire department , health and building inspectors all seemed unwilling to act or incapable of doing anything about the problem before tragedy struck . Their inadequate performance resulted last week in a needless disaster  --  the city 's worst fire in 79 years . <P> The Happy Land Social Club was a Hispanic , mostly Honduran , gathering spot in a seedy commercial section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1988 because it had no fire exits , sprinkler system , fire alarm or emergency lighting . It did shut down , but only briefly . Police knew it had reopened ; they arrested its bartender last July for selling liquor without a license . <P> Happy Land was living up to its name on Sunday last week . Well after 3 a.m. , strobe lights were pulsing through the cigarette haze to bounce off young women twisting in slinky miniskirts and high heels . Youthful men in leather pants and bright shirts picked up the beat of salsa , reggae and Honduran calypso . <P> But then an angry man joined the revelers . Julio Gonzalez , 36 , one of Fidel Castro 's cast-off gifts to the U.S. in the 1980 Mariel boatlift , came to plead with his estranged girlfriend , Lydia Feliciano , 45 . She earned $150 a night checking coats and taking tickets ( $5 each ) at the club . Gonzalez had lived with Feliciano for eight apparently calm years . But in February he lost his job as a warehouseman . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niece , and she ordered him to leave her apartment . Now living in a tiny room and hustling for handouts on the street , he wanted her to take him back . She refused . When he swore at her , a bouncer ordered him to leave . He did , but with a parting threat : " I will be back . I will shut this place down . " <P> Police say Gonzalez has confessed to filling a plastic container with $1 worth of gasoline at a nearby station , then splashing it through the club 's front door . He threw a lighted match into the gasoline and watched the flames rise . <P> The acrid black smoke billowed so swiftly through the two-level , 22-ft. by 58-ft. brick building that the few shouts of " Fuego ! Fuego ! " were too late . Most of the partygoers , who were on the low-ceilinged second level , where there were no windows or exits , stampeded toward two narrow stairways . The main door on the ground floor was blocked by flames . The only window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage , and four others ran to a seldom-used second door , where they forced open a gate to become the only known survivors . <P> In a matter of minutes , 87 people died from the toxic smoke . Firemen arrived within three minutes of being called , but found a deathly silence . They soon discovered only corpses jumbled on the stairs , stretched out on the dance floors or still astride barstools and clutching glasses .
