The old man was corpulent like a seal , muscle clothed in fat to guarantee warmth , his skin smooth and his general proportions  --  stocky limbs and a broad chest  --  implying a natural , almost unconscious power . He wore little despite the damp chill . The brown eyes seemed capable and shrewd . And humorless . We were standing on a graveled beach , staring at his tiny sea ; and after a long silence , he informed me , " I do n't approve of what you do , Mr. Locum . It 's pretentious and wasteful , this business of building cruel places . You 're not an artist , and I think it 's healthy for both of us to know my objections to your presence here . " <p> I showed a grin , then said , " Fine . I 'll leave . " I had spent three months inside cramped quarters , but I told him , " Your shuttle can take me back to the freighter . I 'll ride out with the iron . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Provo Lei , the wealthiest person fora light-month in any direction . " I have these objections , but you are n't here for me . You 're a gift to my daughter . She and I have finally agreed that she needs a tutor , and you seem qualified . Shall we dispense with pretenses ? You are a toy . This is n't what you would call a lush commission , and you 'd prefer to be near a civilized world , building some vicious forest for society people who want prestige and novelty . Yet you need my money , do n't you ? You 're neither a tutor nor a toy , but your debts outweigh your current value as an artist . Or am I wrong ? " <p> I attempted another grin , then shrugged . " I can work on a larger scale here . " I 'm not someone who hesitates or feels insecure , but I did both just then . " I 've had other offers  --  " <p> " None of substance , " Provo interrupted . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of his house  --  a sealed hyperfiber tent covering ten thousand hectares of tundra and ice water  --  and beyond the tent walls was an entire world , earth-size but less massive . Not counting robots , the world 's population was two . Counting me , three . As we stood there enjoying impolite conversation , an army of robots was beneath the deep water-ice crust , gnawing at rock , harvesting metals to be sold at a profit throughout the district . <p> " What do you think of my little home , Mr. Locum ? Speaking as a professional terraformer , of course . " <p> I blinked , hesitating again . <p> " Please . Be honest . " <p> " It belongs to a miser . " Provo did n't have propriety over bluntness . " This is cheap Arctic package . Low diversity , a rigorous durability , and almost no upkeep . I 'm guessing , but it feels like the home of a man who prefers solitude . And since you 've lived here for two hundred years , alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's too much of a guess . " <p> He surprised me , halfway nodding . <p> " Your daughter 's how old ? Thirty ? " I paused , then said , " Unless she 's exactly like you , I would think that she would have left by now . She 's not a child , and she must be curious about the rest of the Realm . Which makes me wonder if I 'm an inducement of some kind . A bribe . Speaking as a person , not a terraformer , I think she must be frighteningly important to you . Am I correct ? " <p> The brown eyes watched me , saying nothing . <p> I felt a brief remorse . " You asked for my opinion , " I reminded him . <p> " Do n't apologize . I want honesty . " He rubbed his rounded chin , offering what could have been confused for a smile . " And you 're right , I do bribe my daughter . In a sense . She 's my responsibility , and why should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to be a terraformer ? " <p> " Of the artistic variety , yes . " <p> I moved my feet , cold gravel crunching under my boots . <p> " But this ' cheap package , ' as you so graciously described it , is a recent condition . Before this I maintained a mature Arctic steppe , dwarf mammoths here and a cold-water reef offshore . At no small expense , Mr. Locum , and I 'm not a natural miser . " <p> " It sounds like Beringa , " I muttered . <p> " My home world , yes . " Beringa was a giant snowball terraformed by commercial souls , carpeted with plastics and rock and rich artificial soils , its interior still frozen while billions lived above in a kind of perpetual summer , twenty-hour days but limited heat . The natives were built like Provo , tailored genes keeping them comfortably fat and perpetually warm . In essence , Beringa was an inspired apartment complex , lovely in every superficial way . <p> The kind of work I hated most , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is very much makeshift . " <p> I gestured at the tundra . " What happened ? " <p> " Ula thought I would enjoy a grove of hot-sap trees . " <p> Grimacing , I said , " They would n't work at all . " Ecologically speaking . Not to mention aesthetically . <p> " Regardless , " said Provo , " I purchased vats of totipotent cells , at no small cost , and she insisted on genetically tailoring them . Making them into a new species . " <p> " Easy enough , " I whispered . <p> " And yet . " He paused and sighed . " Yet some rather gruesome metabolites were produced . Released . Persistent and slow toxins that moved through the food web . My mammoths sickened and died , and since I rather enjoy mammoth meat , having been raised on little else  --  " <p> " You were poisoned , " I gasped . <p> " Somewhat , yes . But I have recovered nicely . " The nonsmile showed again , eyes pained . Bemused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And of course I had to pay for an extensive cleanup , which brought on a total environmental failure . This tundra package was an easy replacement , and besides , it carries a warranty against similar troubles . " <p> Popular on toxic worlds , I recalled . Heavy metals and other terrors were shunted away from the human foods . <p> " You see ? I 'm not a simple miser . " <p> " It should n't have happened , " I offered . <p> Provo merely shrugged his broad shoulders , admitting " I do love my daughter . And you 're correct about some things . But the situation here , like anywhere , is much more complicated than the casual observer can perceive . " <p> I looked at the drab hyperfiber sky  --  the illusion of heavy clouds over a waxy low sun  --  and I gave a quick appreciative nod . <p> " The area around us is littered with even less successful projects , " Provo warned me . <p> I said , " Sad . " <p> The old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ill to befall her , and I mean that as an unveiled warning . Ula has never existed with ordinary people . My hope is that I live long enough to see her mature , to become happy and normal , and perhaps gain some skills as a terraformer too . You are my best hope of the moment . Like it or not , that 's why I hired you . " <p> I stared out at his little sea . A lone gull was circling bleating out complaints about the changeless food . <p> " My daughter will become infatuated with you , " I heard . " Which might be a good thing . Provided you can resist temptation , infatuation will keep her from being disillusioned . Never , never let her become disillusioned . " <p> " No ? " <p> " Ula 's not her father . Too much honesty is a bad thing . " <p> I felt a momentary , inadequate sense of fear . <p> " Help her build one workable living place . Nothing fancy , and please , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounded stone . " She has an extensive lab and stocks of totipotent cells . You 'll need nothing . And I 'll pay you in full , for your time and your imaginary expertise . " <p> I found myself cold for many reasons , staring skyward . " I 've been to Beringa , " I told Provo . " It 's ridiculously cheery . Giant flowers and giant butterflies , mammoths and tame bears . And a clear blue sky . " <p> " Exactly , " he replied , flinging the stone into the water . " And I would have kept my blue sky , but the color would have been dishonest . " <p> A mosquito landed on my hand , tasting me and discovering that I was n't a caribou , flying off without drawing blood . <p> " Bleak fits my mood , Mr. Locum . " <p> I looked at him . <p> And again he offered his nonsmile , making me feel , if only for an instant , sorry for him . <p> Beaty , say some artists , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ula Lei was a beautiful young woman . <p> She had a hundred hectare tent pitched beside her father 's home , the place filled with bio stocks and empty crystal wombs and computers capable of modeling any kind of terraforming project . She was standing beside a huge reader , waving and saying " Come here , " with the voice people use on robots . Neither polite nor intimidating . <p> I approached , thinking that she looked slight . Almost underfed . Where I had expected an ungraceful woman-child , I instead found a mannerly but almost distant professional- was she embarrassed to need a tutor ? Or was she unsure how to act with a stranger ? Either way , the old man 's warning about my " toy " status seemed overstated . Taking a frail , pretty hand , feeling the polite and passionless single shake , I went from wariness to a mild funk , wondering if I had failed some standard . It wounded me when she stared right through me , asking with a calm dry voice , " What shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relief , and I smiled , telling her , " Decide on our project , and its scale . " <p> " Warm work , and huge . " <p> I blinked . " Your father promised us a thousand hectare tent , plus any of his robots  --  " <p> " I want to use an old mine , " she informed me . <p> " With a warm environment ? " <p> " It has a rock floor , and we can insulate the walls and ceiling with field charges , then refrigerate as a backup . " She knew the right words , at least in passing . " I 've already selected which one . Here . I 'll show you everything . " <p> She was direct like her father , and confident . But Ula was n't her father 's child . Either his genes had been suppressed from conception , or they were n't included . Lean and graced with the fine features popular on tropical worlds , her body was the perfect antithesis of provo 's buttery one . Very black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Those eyes noticed that I was wearing a heavy work jersey ; I had changed clothes after meeting with Provo , wanting this jersey 's self-heating capacity . Yet the temperature was twenty degrees warmer than the tundra , and her tropical face smiled when I pulled up my sleeves and pocketed my gloves . The humor was obvious only to her . <p> Then she was talking again , telling me , " The main chamber is eight kilometers by fifty , and the ceiling is ten kilometers tall in the center . Pressurized ice . Very strong . " Schematics flowed past me . " The floor is the slope of a dead volcano . Father left when he found better ores . " <p> A large operation , I noted . The rock floor would be porous and easily eroded , but rich in nutrients . Four hundred square kilometers ? I had never worked on that scale , unless I counted computer simulations . <p> A graceful hand called up a new file . " Here 's a summary of the world 's best-guess history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I had already guessed most of it for myself . Provo 's World was like thousands of other sunless bodies in the Realm . Born in an unknown solar system , it had been thrown free by a near-collision , drifting into interstellar space , its deep seas freezing solid and its internal heat failing . In other regions it would have been terraformed directly , but our local district was impoverished when it came to metals . Provo 's World had rich ores , its iron and magnesium , aluminum and the rest sucked up by industries and terraformers alike . A healthy green world requires an astonishing amount of iron , if only to keep it in hemoglobin . The iron from this old mine now circulated through dozens of worlds ; and almost certainly some portion of that iron was inside me , brought home now within my own blood . <p> " I 've already sealed the cavern , " Ula informed me . " I was thinking of a river down the middle , recirculating , and a string of waterfalls  --  " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a smile . " No ? " <p> " I do n't like waterfalls , " I warned her . <p> " Because you belong to the New Traditionalist movement . I know . " She shrugged her shoulders . " ' Waterfalls are cliches , ' you claim . ' Life , done properly , is never pretty in simple ways . " ' <p> " Exactly . " <p> " Yet , " Ula assured me , " this is my project . " <p> I had come an enormous distance to wage a creative battle . Trying to measure my opponent , I asked , " What do you know about NTs ? " <p> " You want to regain the honesty of the original Earth . Hard winters . Droughts . Violent predation . Vibrant chaos . " Her expression became coy , then vaguely wicked . " But who 'd want to terraform an entire world according to your values ? And who would live on it , given the chance ? " <p> " The fight people , " I replied , almost by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should leave every place fat and green and pretty . And iron-hungry too . " <p> " Like Beringa . " <p> She nodded , the wickedness swelling . " Did you hear about my little mistake ? " <p> " About the hot-sap trees ? I 'm afraid so . " <p> " I guess I do need help . " Yet Ula did n't appear contrite . " I know about you , Mr. Locum . After my father hired you  --  I told him NTs work cheap  --  I ordered holos of every one of your works . You like working with jungles , do n't you ? " <p> Jungles were complex and intricate . And dense . And fun . <p> " What about Yanci 's jungle ? " she asked me . " It 's got a spectacular waterfall , if memory serves . " <p> A socialite had paid me to build something bold , setting it inside a plastic cavern inside a pluto-class world . Low gravity ; constant mist ; an aggressive assemblage of wild animals and carnivorous plants . " Perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old-school terraformer  --  little more than a plumber  --  to add one of those achingly slow rivers and falls , popular on every low-gravity world in the Realm . <p> " Yes , Mr. Locum ? " she teased . " What do you want to say ? " <p> " Call me Hann , " I growled . <p> My student pulled her hair away from her jungle-colored eyes . " I 've always been interested in New Traditionalists . Not that I believe what you preach . . . not entirely . . . but I 'm glad Father hired one of you . " <p> I was thinking about my ruined jungle . Fifty years in the past , and still it made my mouth go dry and my heart pound . <p> " How will we move water without a river and falls ? " <p> " Underground , " I told her . " Through the porous rock . We can make a string of pools and lakes , and there wo n't be erosion problems for centuries . " <p> " Like this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much like my idea appeared before us . " I did this in case you did n't like my first idea . " <p> A single waterfall was at the high end of the cavern . <p> " A compromise , " she offered . Enlarging the image , she said , " Does n't it look natural ? " <p> For a cliche , I thought . <p> " The reactor and pumps will be behind this cliff , and the water sounds can hide any noise  --  " <p> " Fine , " I told her . <p> "  --  and the entranceway too . You walk in through the falls . " <p> Another cliche , but I said , " Fine . " Years of practice had taught me to compromise with the little points . Why fight details when there were bigger wars to wage ? <p> " Is it all right , Mr. Locum ? " A wink . " I want both of us happy when this is done . Hann , I mean . " <p> For an audience of how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of friends and tagalongs and nobodys and lovers . And since they rarely had enough money to fuel their lifestyles , they would open their possessions to the curious and the public . <p> But here I could do my best work , and who would know ? <p> " Shall we make a jungle , Hann ? " <p> I would know , I told myself . <p> And with a forced wink , I said , " Let 's begin . " <p> Terraforming is an ancient profession . <p> Making your world more habitable began on the Earth itself , with the first dancing fire that warmed its builder 's cave ; and everything since  --  every green world and asteroid and comet  --  is an enlargement on that first cozy cave . A hotter fusion fire brings heat and light , and benign organisms roam inside standardized biomes . For two hundred and ten centuries humans have expanded the Realm , mastering the tricks to bring life to a nearly dead universe . The frontier is an expanding sphere more than twenty light-years in radius  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one other living world has been discovered . Pitcairn . Alien and violent , and gorgeous . And the basic inspiration/or the recent New Traditionalist movement . Pitcairn showed us how bland and domesticated our homes had become , riddled with cliches , every world essentially like every other world . Sad , sad , sad . <p> Here I found myself with four hundred square kilometers of raw stone . How long would it take to build a mature jungle ? Done simply , a matter of months . But novelty would take longer , much to Provo 's consternation . We would make fresh species , every ecological tie unique . I anticipated another year on top of the months , which was very good . We had the best computers , the best bio-stocks , and thousands of robots eager to work without pause or complaint . It was an ideal situation , I had to admit to myself . Very nearly heaven . <p> We insulated the ice ceiling and walls by three different means . Field charges enclosed the heated air . If they were breached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And at my insistence we added a set of emergency ducts , cold compressed air waiting in side caverns in case of tragedies . Every organism could go into a sudden dormancy , and the heat would be sucked into the huge volumes of surrounding ice . Otherwise the ceiling might sag and collapse , and I did n't want that to happen . Ula 's jungle was supposed to outlast all of us . Why else go to all of this bother ? <p> We set the reactor inside the mine shaft , behind the eventual cliche . Then lights were strong , heating the cavern 's new air , and we manufactured rich soils with scrap rock and silt from Provo 's own little sea . The first inhabitants were bacteria and fungi set free to chew and multiply , giving the air its first living scent . Then robots began assembling tree-shaped molds , sinking hollow roots into the new earth and a sketchwork of branches meshing overhead , beginning the future canopy . <p> We filled the molds with water , nutrients , and nourishing electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like baking than gardening , this was how mature forest could be built from scratch . Living cells divided at an exponential rate , then assembled themselves into tissue-types  --  sapwood and heartwood , bark and vascular tubes . It 's a kind of superheated cultivation , and how else could artists like me exist ? Left to Nature 's pace , anything larger than a terrarium would consume entire lives . Literally . <p> Within five months  --  on schedule  --  we were watching the robots break up the molds , exposing the new trees to the air . And that 's a symbolic moment worth a break and a little celebration , which we held . <p> Just Ula and me . <p> I suggested inviting Provo , but she told me , " Not yet . It 's too soon to show him yet . " <p> Perhaps . Or did she want her father kept at a distance ? <p> I did n't ask . I did n't care . We were dining on top of a rough little hill , at the midpoint of the cavern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leafless , resembling thousands of stately old trees pruned back by giant shears . Stubby , enduring trees . I toasted our success , and Ula grinned , almost singing when she said , " I have n't been the bother you expected , have I ? " <p> No , she had n't been . <p> " And I know more about terraforming than you thought . " <p> More than I would admit . I nodded and said , " You 're adept , considering you 're self-taught . " <p> " No , " she sang , " you 're the disappointment . " <p> " Am I ? " <p> " I expected . . . well , more energy . More inspiration . " She rose to her feet , gesturing at our half-born creation . " I really hoped an NT would come up with bizarre wonders  --  " <p> " Like an eight-legged terror ? " <p> " Exactly . " <p> It had been her odd idea , and I 'd dismissed it twenty times before I realized it was a game with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kept telling her that radical tailoring took too much time and too frequently failed . And besides , I added , our little patch of jungle was n't large enough for the kind of predator she had in mind . <p> " I wish we could have one or two of them , " she joked . <p> I ignored her . I 'd learned that was best . <p> " But do n't you agree ? Nothing we 've planned is that new or spectacular . " <p> Yet I was proud of everything . What did she want ? Our top three camivores were being tailored at that moment  --  a new species of fire-eagle ; a variation on black nightcats ; and an intelligent , vicious species of monkey . Computer models showed that only two of them would survive after the first century . Which two depended on subtle , hard-to-model factors . That was one of the more radical , unpopular NT principles . " The fit survive . " We build worlds with too much diversity , knowing that some of our creations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting our worlds decide for themselves . <p> " I wish we could have rainstorms , " she added . It was another game , and she waved her arms while saying " Big winds . Lightning . I 've always wanted to see lightning . " <p> " There 's not enough energy to drive storms , " I responded . The rains were going to be mild events that came in the night . When we had nights , in a year . " I do n't want to risk  --  " <p> "  --  damaging the ice . I know . " She sat again , closer now , smiling as she said , " No , I do n't care . It 's coming along perfectly . " <p> I nodded , gazing up at the brilliant white sky . The mining robots had left the ice gouged and sharp , and somehow that was appropriate . An old violence was set against a rich new order , violent in different ways . A steamy jungle cloaked in ice ; an appealing even poetic dichotomy . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of molds being tom apart and loaded onto mug-rails , my partner came even closer , touching one of my legs and asking , " How else have I surprised you ? ' <p> She had n't touched me in months , even in passing . <p> It took me a moment to gather myself , and I took her hand and set it out of the way , with a surety of motion . <p> She said nothing , smiling and watching me . <p> And once again , for the umpteenth time , I wondered what Ula was thinking . Because I did n't know and could n't even guess . We had been together for months , our relationship professional and bloodless . Yet I always had the strong impression that she showed me what she wanted to show me , and I could n't even guess how much of that was genuine . <p> " How else ? " she asked again . <p> " You 're an endless surprise , " I told her . <p> But instead of appearing pleased , she dipped her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing rounded shapes in the new soil , then erasing them with a few quick tiger swipes . <p> I met Provo behind the waterfall , in the shaft , his sturdy shape emerging from the shadows ; and he gave me a nod and glanced at the curtain of water , never pausing , stepping through and vanishing with a certain indifference . I followed , knowing where the flow was weakest  --  where I would be the least soaked  --  and stepped out onto a broad rock shelf , workboots gripping and my dampened jersey starting to dry itself . <p> The old man was gazing into the forest . <p> I asked , " Would you like a tour ? " Then I added , " We could ride one of the mag-rails , or we could walk . " <p> " No , " he replied . " Neither . " <p> Why was he here ? Provo had contacted me , no warning given . He had asked about his daughter 's whereabouts . " She 's in the lab , " I had said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had told me . Provo wanted just the two of us for his first inspection . <p> Yet now he acted indifferent to our accomplishments , dropping his head and walking off the rock shelf and stopping then looking back at me . And over the sound of tumbling water , he asked , " How is she ? " <p> " Ula 's fine . " <p> " No troubles with her ? " he inquired . <p> It was several weeks after our hilltop celebration , and I barely remembered the hand on my leg . " She 's doing a credible job . " <p> Provo appeared disappointed . <p> I asked him , " How should she be ? ' <p> He did n't answer . " She likes you , Mr. Locum . We 've talked about you . She 's told me , more than once . . . that you 're perfect . " <p> I felt a sudden warmth , and I smiled . <p> Disappointment faded . " How is she ? Speaking as her teacher , of course . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to praise too much , lifting his expectations . " She has inspirations , as she calls them . Some are workable , and some are even lovely . " <p> " Inspirations , " he echoed . <p> I readied some examples . I thought Provo would want them , enjoying this chance to have a parent 's pride . But instead he looked off into the trees again , the stubby branches sprouting smaller branches and fat green leaves . He seemed to be hunting for something specific , old red eyes squinting . Finally he said , " No . " He said , " I should n't tell you . " <p> " Tell me ? " <p> " Because you do n't need to know . " He sighed and turned , suddenly older and almost frail . " If she 's been on her best behavior , maybe I should keep my mouth shut . " <p> I said nothing for a long moment . <p> Provo shuffled across the clearing , sitting on a downed log with a certain gravity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then killed . Sitting next to him , I asked , " What is it , Mr. Lei ? " <p> " My daughter . " <p> " Yes ? " <p> " She is n't . " <p> I nodded and said , " Adopted . " <p> " Did she tell you ? " <p> " I know genetics . And I did n't think you 'd suppress your own genes . " <p> He looked at the waterfall . It was extremely wide and not particularly tall , spilling onto the shelf and then into a large pond . A pair of mag-rails earned equipment in and out on the far shore . Otherwise little moved . I noticed a tiny tag-along mosquito who would n't bite either of us . It must have come from the tundra , and it meant nothing . It would die in a few hours , I thought ; and Provo suddenly told me , " Adopted , yes . And I think it 's fair to tell you the circumstances . " <p> Why the tension ? <p> " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one of the keys to my success . " He paused , then said , " I came to this world alone . I charted it and filed my claims and defended it from the jealous mining corporations . Every moment of my life has gone into these mines , and I 'm proud of my accomplishments . Life . My metals have brought life and prosperity to millions , and I make no apologies . Do you understand me ? " <p> I said , " Yes . " <p> " Few people come here . Like that freighter that brought you , most of the ships are unmanned . " Another pause . " But there are people who make their livelihood tiding inside the freighters . Perhaps you 've known a few of them . " <p> I had n't , no . <p> " They are people . They exist on a continuum . All qualities of human beings live inside those cramped quarters , some of them entirely decent . Honest . Capable of more compassion than I could hope to feel . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Ula 's biological parents were n't at that end of the continuum . Believe me . When I first saw her . . . when I boarded her parents ' ship to supervise the loading . . . well , I wo n't tell you what I saw . And smelled . And learned about the capacities of other human beings . Some things are best left behind , I think . Let 's forget them . Please . " <p> " How old was Ula ? " <p> " A child . Three standard years , that time . " A small strong hand wiped at his sweating face . " Her parents purchased loads of mixed metals from me , then sold them to one of the water worlds near Beringa . To help plankton bloom , I imagine . And for two years , every day , I found myself remembering that tiny girl , pitying her , a kind of guilt building inside me because I 'd done nothing to help her , nothing at all . " Again the hands tried to dry his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And yet , Mr. Locum , I was thankful too . Glad that I would never see her again . I assumed . . . I knew . . . that space itself would swallow them . That someone else would save her . That her parents would change . That I would n't be involved again , even if I tried  --  " <p> " They came back , " I muttered . <p> Provo straightened his back , grimacing as if in pain . " Two years later , yes . " Brown eyes closed , opened . " They sent me word of their arrival , and in an instant a plan occurred to me . All at once I knew the right thing to do . " Eyes closed and stayed closed . " I was onboard , barely one quick glance at that half-starved child , and with a self-righteous voice I told the parents , ' I want to adopt her . Name your price .

It 's just that they could n't sell her anymore than they could kill her . Because if she died , who else would they have to torture ? " <p> I said nothing . <p> " They could n't be bought , I learned . Quickly . " Provo swallowed and grabbed the log , knuckles pale as the hands shook . " You claim my daughter is well-behaved , and I 'm pleased . You say she 's bright , and I 'm not at all surprised . And since you seem to have her confidence and trust , I think it 's only fair to tell you about her past . To warn you . " <p> " How did you adopt her ?

" <p> I felt very distant , very calm . <p> " An accident , " he repeated . <p> I gave him a wary glance , asking . " Does she know what happened ? " <p> Provo 's eyes opened wide , almost startled . " About the accident ? Nothing ! About her past life ? She remembers , I 'm sure . . . nothing . None of it . " Just the suggestion of memories caused him to nearly panic . " No , Mr. Locum . . . you see , once I had legal custody . . . even before then . . . I paid an expert from Beringa to come here and examine her , and treat her . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of expert ? " <p> " In psychology , you idiot ! What do you think I mean ? " Then he gave a low moan , pulling loose a piece of fibrous bark . " To save her . To wipe away every bad memory and heal her , which he did quite well . A marvelous job of it . I paid him a bonus . He deserved it . " He threw the bark onto the pond . " I 've asked Ula about her past , a thousand times . . . and she remembers none of it . The expert said she might , or that it might come out in peculiar ways . . . but she does n't and has no curiosity about those times . . . and maybe I should n't have told you , I 'm sorry . . . ! " <p> I looked at the pond , deep and clear , some part of me wondering how soon we would inoculate it with algae and water weeds . <p> Then Provo stood again , telling me , " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And tell her . . . tell her that I 'm pleased . . . " <p> I gave a quick compliant nod . <p> " It 's too warm for my taste . " He made a turn , gazing into the jungle and saying , " But shady . Sometimes I like a place with shade , and it 's pleasant enough , I suppose . " He swallowed and gave a low moan , then said , " And tell her for me , please . . . that I 'm very much looking forward to the day it 's done . . . . " <p> Terraformers build their worlds at least twice . <p> The first time it is a model , a series of assumptions and hard numbers inside the best computers ; and the second time it is wood and flesh , false sunlight and honest sound . And that second incarnation is never the same as the model . It 's an eternal lesson learned by every terraformer , and by every other person working with complexity . <p> Models fail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some overlooked or mismeasured factor , or a stew of factors . And it 's the same for people too . A father and a teacher speak about the daughter and the student , assuming certain special knowledge ; and together they misunderstand the girl , their models having little to do with what is true . <p> Worlds are easy to observe . <p> Minds are secretive . And subtle . And molding them is never so easy and clear as the molding of mere worlds , I think . <p> Ula and I were working deep in the cavern , a few days after Provo 's visit , teaching our robots how and where to plant an assortment of newly tailored saplings . We were starting our understory , vines and shrubs and shade-tolerant trees to create a dense tangle . And the robots struggled , designed to wrestle metals from rocks , not to baby the first generations of new species . At one point I waded into the fray , trying to help , shouting and grabbing at a mechanical ann while taking a blind step , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed , watching me hobble backward . Then she turned sympathetic , absolutely convincing when she said , " Poor darling . " She thought we should move to the closest water and clean out my wound . " It looks like it 's swelling Hann . " <p> It was . I had designed this plant with an irritating protein , and I joked about the value of field testing , using a stick as my impromptu crutch . Thankfully we were close to one of the ponds , and the cool spring water felt wondrous , Ula removing my boot and the spine while I sprawled out on my back , eyes fixed on the white expanse of ice and lights , waiting for the pain to pass . <p> " If you were an ordinary terraformer , " she observed , " this would n't have happened . " <p> " I 'd be somewhere else , and rich , " I answered . <p> She moved from my soaking foot to my head , sitting beside me , knees pulled to her face and patches of perspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tooth and claw , " ' she quoted . <p> A New Traditionalist motto . We were building a wilderness of spines and razored leaves ; and later we 'd add stinging wasps and noxious beetles , plus a savage biting midge that would attack in swarms . " Honest testing nature , " I muttered happily . <p> Ula grinned and nodded , one of her odd expressions growing . And she asked , " But why ca n't we do more ? " <p> More ? <p> " Make the fire eagles attack us on sight , for instance . If we 're after bloody claws  --  " <p> " No , " I interrupted . " That has no ecological sense at all . " Fire eagles were huge , but they 'd never prey on humans . <p> " Oh , sure . I forgot . " <p> She had n't , and both of us knew it . Ula was playing another game with me . <p> I looked across the water , trying to ignore her . The far shore was a narrow stretch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , field charges setting up their barrier against the heat . Beyond , not twenty meters beyond , was a rigid and hard-frozen milky wall that lifted into the sky , becoming the sky , part of me imagining giant eagles flying overhead , hunting for careless children . <p> " What 's special about the original Earth ? " I heard . " Tell me again , please , Hann . " <p> No , I would n't . But even as I did n't answer , I answered . In my mind I was thinking about three billion years of natural selection , amoral and frequently short-sighted . . . and wondrous in its beauty , power , and scope . . . and how we in the Realm had perfected a stupefying version of that wonder , a million worlds guaranteed to be safe and comfortable for the trillions of souls clinging to them . <p> " Here , " said Ula , " we should do everything like the original Earth . " <p> I let myself ask , " What do you mean ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases and poisonous snakes , for instance . " <p> " And we can be imprisoned for murder when the first visitor dies . " <p> " But we are n't going to have visitors , " she warned me . " So why not ? A viper with a nerve toxin in its fangs ? Or maybe some kind of plague carried by those biting midges that you 're so proud of . " <p> She was joking , I thought . Then I felt a sudden odd doubt . <p> Ula 's entire face smiled , nothing about it simple . " What 's more dangerous ? Spines or no spines ? " <p> " More dangerous ? " <p> " For us . " She touched my ankle , watching me . <p> " Spines , " I voted . <p> " Back on Earth , " she continued , " there were isolated islands . And the plants that colonized them would lose their spines and toxic chemicals , their old enemies left behind . And birds would lose their power of flight . And the tortoises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , easy living . " <p> " What 's your point , teacher ? " <p> She laughed and said , " We arrived . We brought goats and rats and ourselves , and the native life would go extinct . " <p> " I know history , " I assured her . <p> " Not having spines is more dangerous than having them . " <p> I imagined that I understood her point , nodding now and saying , " See ? That 's what NTs argue . Not quite in those terms  --  " <p> " Our worlds are like islands , soft and easy . " <p> " Exactly . " I grinned and nodded happily . " What I want to do here , and everywhere  --  " <p> " You 're not much better , " she interrupted . <p> No ? <p> " Not much at all , " she grumbled , her expression suddenly black . Sober . " Nature is so much more cruel and honest than you 'd ever be . " <p> Suddenly I was thinking about Provo 's story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been anything but soft and easy , and I felt pity ; and I felt curiosity , wondering if she had nightmares and then , for an instant , wondering if I could help her in some important way . <p> Ula was watching me , reading my expression . <p> Without warning she bent close , kissing me before I could react and then sitting up again , laughing like a silly young girl . <p> I asked , " Why did you do that ? " <p> " Why did I stop , you mean ? " <p> I swallowed , saying nothing . <p> Then she bent over again , kissing me again , pausing to whisper , " Why do n't we ? " <p> I could n't find any reason to stop . <p> And suddenly she was removing her jersey , and mine , and I looked past her for an instant , blinding myself with the glare of lights and white ice , all at once full of reasons why we should stop and my tongue stolen out of my mouth . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The oldest teacher on the staff invited me into her office , congratulated me for my good grades , then asked me in a matter-of-fact way , " Where do these worlds we build actually live , Mr. Locum ? Can you point to where they are ? " <p> She was cranky and ancient , her old black flesh turning white from simple age . I assumed that she was having troubles with her mind , the poor woman . A shrug ; a gracious smile . Then I told her , " I do n't know , ma'am . I would think they live where they live . " <p> A smartass answer , if there ever was . <p> But she was n't startled or even particularly irritated by my non-reply , a long lumpy finger lifting into the air between us , then pointing at her own forehead . " In our minds , Mr. Locum . That 's the only place they can live for us , because where else can we live ? " <p> " May I go ? " I asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I began to rise to my feet . <p> And she told me , " You are a remarkably stupid man , I think , Mr. Locum . Untalented and vain and stupid in many fundamental ways , and you have a better chance of success than most of your classmates . " <p> " I 'm leaving " I warned her . <p> " No . " She shook her head . " You are n't here even now . " <p> We were one week into our honeymoon  --  sex and sleep broken up with the occasional bout of work followed with a swim  --  and we were lying naked on the shore of the first pond . Ula looked at me , smiling and touching me , then saying " You know , this world once was alive . " <p> Her voice was glancingly saddened , barely audible over the quiet clean splash of the cliche . I nodded , saying " I realize that . " Then I waited for whatever would follow . I had learned about her lectures during the last seven days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three billion years ago . " She drew a planet on my chest . " Imagine if it had n't been thrown away from its sun . If it had evolved complex life . If some kind of intelligent , tool-using fish had built spaceships  --  " <p> " Very unlikely , " I countered . <p> She shrugged and asked , " Have you seen our fossils ? " <p> No , but I did n't need to see them . Very standard types . The Realm was full of once-living worlds . <p> " This sea floor , " she continued , " was dotted with hot-water vents , and bacteria evolved and lived by consuming metal ions  --  " <p> "  --  which they laid down , making the ore that you mine , " I interrupted . With growing impatience , I asked , " Why tell me what I already know , Ula ? " <p> " How do you think it would feel ? Your world is thrown free of your sun , growing cold and freezing over . . . nothing you can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . ? " <p> The vents would have kept going until the planet 's tepid core grew cold , too little radioactivity to stave off the inevitable . " But we 're talking about bacteria , " I protested . " Nothing sentient . Unless you 've found something bigger in the fossil record . " <p> " Hardly , " she said . Then she sat upright , small breasts catching the light and my gaze . " I was just thinking . " <p> I braced myself . <p> " I remember when Father showed me one of the old vents . . . the first one I ever saw . . . " <p> I doubly braced myself . <p> " I was five or six , I suppose , and we were walking through a new mine , down a dead rift valley , two hundred kilometers under the frozen sea . He pointed to mounds of dirty ore , then he had one of his robots slice into one of them , showing me the striations . . . how layers of bacteria had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human race , he said . . . and I cried . . . . " <p> " Did you ? " <p> " Because they had died . " She appeared close to tears again , but one hand casually scratched her breasts . Then the face brightened , almost smiling as she asked , " What 's your favorite world ? " <p> Changing subjects ? I could n't be sure . <p> " Your own world , or anyone 's . Do you have favorites ? " <p> Several of them , yes . I described the most famous world  --  a small spinning asteroid filled with wet forest  --  and I told her about the artists , all tetraformers who had journeyed to the alien world of Pitcairn . They were the first New Traditionalists . I had never seen the work for myself , ten light-years between us and it , but I 'd walked through the holos , maybe hundreds of times . The artists had been changed by Pitcairn . They never used alien lifeforms  --  there are tough clear laws against the exporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to capture something of the strangeness and strength of the place . And I could n't do it justice . I found myself blabbering about the quality of light and the intensity of certain golden birds . . . and at some point I quit speaking , realizing that Ula was n't paying attention to me . <p> She heard silence and said , " It sounds intriguing . " Then with a slow , almost studied pose , she said , " Let me tell you about something even more fascinating . " <p> I felt a moment of anger . How dare she ignore me ! Then the emotion evaporated , betraying me , leaving me to wait while she seemed to gather herself , her face never more serious or composed . Or focused . Or complete . <p> " It was the second world that I built , " I heard . " My first world was too large and very clumsy , and I destroyed it by accident . But no matter . What I did that second time was find a very small abandoned mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice walls and filled the chamber with water , then sank a small reactor into the rock , opening up the ancient plumbing and inoculating the water with a mixture of bacteria  --  " <p> " Did you ? " I sputtered . <p> "  --  and reestablishing one vent community . After three billion years of sleep . I fueled the reactor with a measured amount of deuterium , and I enriched the warming water with the proper metals . " A pause . " New striations formed . Superheated black goo was forced from the fossil tubes . And I dressed in a strong pressure suit and walked into that world , and I sat just like we 're sitting here , and waited . " <p> I swallowed . " Waited ? " <p> " The reactor slowed , then stopped . " Ula took a breath and said , " I watched . With the lights on my suit down low , I watched the black goo stop rising , and the water cooled , and eventually new ice began to form against the walls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . for days , for almost two weeks . . . the ice walls closing in on me  --  " <p> " That 's crazy , " I blurted . <p> And she shrugged as if to say , " I do n't care . " A smile emerged , then vanished , and she turned and touched me , saying , " I allowed myself to be frozen into that new ice , my limbs locked in place , my power packs running dry  --  " <p> " But why ? " I asked . " So you 'd know how it felt ? " <p> And she did n't seem to hear me , tilting her head , seemingly listening to some distant sound worthy of her complete attention . Eventually she said , " Father missed me . " A pause . " He came home from a tour of distant mines , and I was missing , and he sent robots out to find me , and they cut me free just before I would have begun to truly suffer . " <p> The girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dramatic breath , then smiled . Her haunted expression vanished in an instant , without effort , and again she was a student , the youngster , and my lover . A single bead of perspiration was rolling along her sternum , then spreading across her taut brown belly ; and I heard myself asking , " Why did you do that shit ? " <p> But the youngster could n't or would n't explain herself , dipping her head and giggling into my ear . <p> " You could have died , " I reminded her . <p> She said , " Do n't be angry , darling . Please ? " <p> An unstable , insane woman-child , and suddenly I was aware of my own heartbeat . <p> " Are you angry with sweet me ? " She reached for me , for a useful part of me , asking . " How can I make you happy , darling ? " <p> " Be normal , " I whispered . <p> " Have n't you paid attention ? " The possessed expression reemerged for an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Normal . My darling . " <p> My excuse , after much thought and practice , was a conference with her father . " I want us to have a backup reactor . In case . " <p> She dismissed the possibility out of hand . " He wo n't give us one . " <p> " And I want to walk on the surface . For a change of scenery . " I paused , then camouflaged my intentions by asking " Care to walk with me ? " <p> " God , no . I 've had enough of those walks , thank you . " <p> Freed for the day , I began by visiting the closest caverns and one deflated tent , poking through dead groves and chiseling up samples of soil and frozen pond water . The cold was absolute . The sky was black and filled with stars , a few dim green worlds lost against the chill . Running quick tests , I tried to identify what had gone wrong and where . Sometimes the answer was obvious ; sometimes I was left with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hundreds and thousands of new species extinct before they had any chance to prosper . <p> Afterward I rode the mag-rail back to Provo 's house , finding where the hot-sap trees had been planted , the spot marked with a shallow lake created when the permafrost melted . I worked alone for twenty minutes , then the owner arrived . He seemed unhurried , yet something in his voice or his forward tilt implied a genuine concern . Or maybe not . I 'd given up trying to decipher their damned family . <p> Pocketing my field instruments , I told Provo , " She 's a good tailor . Too good . " No greetings . No preparatory warning . I just informed him , " I 've watched her , and you ca n't tell me that she 'd introduce a toxic metabolite by accident . Not Ula . " <p> The old man 's face grew a shade paler , his entire body softening ; and he leaned against a boulder , telling me without the slightest concern , " That possibility has crossed my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When we met you warned me not to get too close to her . And not to be too honest . " <p> " I remember . " <p> " How do you know ? Who else has been here ? " <p> No answer . <p> " She 's had another tutor , has n't she ? " <p> " Never . " <p> " Then how can you know ? " <p> " Twice , " Provo told me , " my daughter has taken lovers . Two different crew members from separate freighters . Dullards , both of them . With each there was a period of bliss . They stayed behind and helped Ula with her work , then something would go wrong . I do n't know any details . I refuse to spy on my own daughter . But with the man , her first lover . . . he expressed an interest in leaving I believe . . . in returning to his vocation . . . . " <p> " What happened ? " <p> " Ula pierced the wall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes . " The man sighed , betraying a huge fatigue . " She told me that it was an accident , that she intended just to scare him  --  " <p> " She murdered him ? " I managed . <p> And Provo laughed with relief . " No , no . No , the dullard was able to climb into an emergency suit in time , saving himself . " <p> " What about the other lover ? " <p> " The woman ? " A strong shrug of the shoulders , then he said , " A fire . Another accident . I know less , but I surmise they had had a spat of some kind . A ridiculous , wasteful fit of anger . Although Ula claimed not to have started the blaze . She acted thoroughly innocent , and astonishingly unrepentant . " <p> I swallowed , then whispered , " Your daughter is disturbed . " <p> Provo said , " And did n't I warn you ? Did you not understand me ? " The Soft face was perspiring despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hunting suitable game . " How much forewarning did you require , Mr. Locum ? " <p> I said nothing . <p> " And you 've done so well , too . Better than I had hoped possible , I should tell you . " <p> I opened my mouth , and I said nothing . <p> " She told me . . . yesterday , I think . . . how important you are to her education  --  " <p> " The poison , " I interrupted . <p> Provo quit speaking . <p> " There 's a residue here . In the soil . " I showed him a molecule displayed on my portable reader . " It 's a synthetic alkaloid . Very messy , very tough . And very , very intentional , I think . " A moment 's pause , then I asked him , " Has it occurred to you that she was trying to murder you ? " <p> " Naturally , " he responded , in an instant . <p> " And ? " <p> " And she did n't try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure ? " <p> " You claim that my daughter is bright . Is talented . If she wanted to kill me , even if she was an idiot , do n't you think that right now I would be dead ? " <p> Probably true , I thought . <p> " Two people alone on an empty world . Nothing would be simpler than the perfect murder , Mr. Locum . " <p> " Then what did she want ? " I gestured at the little lake . " What was this about ? " <p> Provo appeared disgusted , impatient . <p> He told me , " I might have hoped that you could explain it to me . " <p> I imagined Ula on the bottom of a freezing sea , risking death in some bid to understand . . . what ? And three times she had endangered others . . . which left another dozen creations that she had killed . . . and was she alone in each of them when they died . . . ? <p> " Discover her purpose , Mr. Locum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If that 's permissible . " <p> I said nothing . <p> " You have been following my suggestions , have n't you ? You are n't becoming too entangled with her , are you ? " <p> I looked at Provo . <p> And he read my face , shaking his head with heavy sadness , saying , " Oh , my , Mr. Locum . Oh , my . " <p> A PURPOSE <p> The possibility gnawed at me . I assumed some kind of madness lay over whatever her rationale , and I wished for a degree in psychiatry , or maybe some life experience with insanity . Anything would help . Riding the mag-rail back into our cavern , replaying the last few months in my mind , I heard part of me begging for me to flee , to turn now and take refuge where I could , then stow away on the first freighter to pass  --  <p>  --  which was impossible , I realized in the same instant . Not to mention dangerous . Acting normal was important , I told myself . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> I have never been more terrified of a human being . <p> Yet Ula seemed oblivious . She greeted me with a kiss and demanded more , and I failed her , nervousness and a sudden fatigue leaving me soft . But she explained it away as stress and unimportant , cuddling up next to me on the shady jungle floor . She said , " Let 's sleep , " and I managed to close my eyes and drift into a broken dreamy sleep , jerking awake to find myself alone . <p> Where had the girl gone ? <p> I called her on our corn-line , hearing her voice and my voice dry and clumsy , asking her , " Where are you ? " <p> " Mutating treefrogs , darling . " <p> Which put her inside her home . Out of my way . I moved to the closest workstation , asking its reader to show me the original schematics and everything that we had done to date ; and I opened up my jersey  --  I was still wearing my heavy , cold-weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was hunting for anything odd or obviously dangerous . A flaw in the ice roof ? None that I could find . A subtle poison in our young trees ? None that showed in the genetic diagrams . But just to be sure , I tested myself . Nothing wrong in my blood , I learned . What else ? There was one oddity , something that I might have noticed before but missed . The trees had quirks in their chemistry . Nothing deadly . lust curious . I was studying a series of sugars , wondering when Ula had slipped them into the tailoring process , and why ; and just then , as if selecting the perfect moment , she said , " Darling , " with a clear close voice . Then , " What are you doing. ? " <p> I straightened my back , and I turned . <p> Ula was standing behind me , the smile bright and certain . And strange . She said , " Hello ? " and then , " What are you doing , darling ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiffest possible voice , I told her , " Nothing . Just checking details . " <p> She approached , taking me around my waist . <p> I hugged her , wondering what to do . <p> Then she released me , pulling back her hair while asking " What did you and my father decide ? " <p> Swallowing was impossible , my throat full of dust . <p> " I forgot to ask before . Do we get a second reactor ? " <p> I managed to shake my head . No . <p> " An unnecessary expense , " she said , perfectly mimicking her father 's voice . She could n't have acted more normal , walking around me while asking " Has the nap helped ? " <p> I watched her undress as she moved . <p> " Feel like fun ? " <p> Why was I afraid ? There were n't any flaws in our work , I knew , and as long as she was with me , nude and in my grasp , what could she do to me ? Nothing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accomplish the task at hand , the event feeling robotic and false , and entirely safe . <p> Afterward she said , " That was the best , " and I knew  --  knew without doubt  --  that Ula was lying . " The best ever , " she told me , kissing my nose and mouth and upturned throat . " We 'll never have a more perfect moment . Can I ask you something ? " <p> " What . . . ? " <p> She said , " It 's something that I 've considered . For a long while , I 've been wondering  --  " <p> " What ? " <p> " About the future . " She straddled me , pressure on my stomach . The grin was sly and expectant . " When Father dies , I inherit this world . All of it and his money too , and his robots . Everything . " <p> A slight nod , and I said , " Yes ? " <p> " What will I do with it ? " <p> I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun ? Not fancy . And brought it here and put it in orbit . I 've estimated how long it would take to melt this sea , if I hurried things along by seeding the ice with little reactors  --  " <p> " Decades , " I interrupted . <p> " Two or three , I think . And then I could terraform an entire world . " She paused , tilting her head and her eyes lifting . " Of course all of this would be destroyed . Which is sad . " She sighed , shrugging her shoulders . " How many people have my kind of wealth , Hann ? In the entire Realm , how many ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " And who already own a world too . How many ? " <p> " Very few . " <p> " And who have an interest in tetraforming , of course . " She giggled and said , " I could be one of a kind . It 's possible . " <p> It was . <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this . Would you , Hann Locum , like to help me ? To remake all of this ice and rock with me ? " <p> I opened my mouth , then hesitated . <p> " Because I do n't deserve all the fun for myself , " she explained , climbing off me . " Would n't that be something ? You might be the first NT tetraformer with your own world . Would n't that make you the envy of your peers ? " <p> " Undoubtedly , " I whispered . <p> Ula walked to her clothes , beginning to dress . " Are you interested ? " <p> I said , " Yes . Sure . " True or not , I wanted to make agreeable sounds . Then I made myself add , " But your father 's in good health . It could be a long time before  --  " <p> " Oh , yeah . " A glib shrug of her shoulders , a vague little-girl smile . " I hope it 's years and years away . I do . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I could n't guess what she was really thinking not even when she removed the odd control from one of her deep pockets . A simple device , homemade and held in her right hand ; and now she winked at me , saying , " I know . " <p> Know ? <p> " What both of you talked about today . Of course I know . " <p> The pressure on my chest grew a thousandfold . <p> " The mosquitoes ? Some are n't . They 're electronic packages dressed up as mosquitoes , and I always hear what Father says  --  " <p> Shit . <p> "  --  and have for years . Always . " <p> I sat upright , hands digging into the damp black soil . <p> She laughed and warned me , " You 're not the first person to hear his confession . I am sorry . He has this guilt , and he salves it by telling people who ca n't threaten him . I suppose he wanted you to feel sorry for him , and to admire him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Of my parents ? Nothing . " She shook her head . " Everything . " A nod and the head tilted , and she told me , " I do have one clear image . I do n't know if it 's memory or if it 's a dream , or what . But I 'm a child inside a smelly freighter , huddled in a corner , watching Provo Lei strangle my real mother . He does n't know I 'm there , of course . " A pause . " If he had known , do you suppose he would have strangled me too ? To save himself , perhaps ? " <p> " I 'm sorry , " I muttered . <p> And she laughed , the sound shrill . Complex . " Why ? He 's a very good father , considering . I love him , and I ca n't blame him for anything . " A pause , then with a caring voice she told me , " I love him quite a lot more than I love you , Hann . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creaking ; and I had to say , " But you poisoned him anyway . " <p> Ula waved her control with a flourish , telling me , " I poisoned everything . All I wanted was for Father to watch . " A shrug . " I tried to make him understand . . . to comprehend . . . but I do n't think he could ever appreciate what I was trying to tell him . Never . " <p> I swallowed , then asked , " What were you telling him ? " <p> Her eyes grew huge , then a finger was waged at me . " No . No , you do n't . " She took a small step backward , shaking her head . " I think it 's just a little too soon for that . Dear . " <p> I waited . <p> Then she waved the control again , saying " Look up , Hann . Will you ? Now ? " <p> " Up ? " I whispered . <p> " This direction . " She pointed at the canopy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted , the solid green ceiling of leaves glowing , branches like veins running through the green , and she must have activated the control , a distinct dick followed by her calm voice saying , " I left out parts of the schematics , Hann . Intentionally . Before you were even hired , you should know . " <p> There was a distant rumbling noise . <p> The ground moved , tall trees swaying for an instant ; then came a flash of light with instant thunder , a bolt of electricity leaping down the long cavern , the force of it swatting me down against the forest floor , heat against my face and chest , every hair on my body lifting for a terrible long instant . <p> Then it was gone again . <p> Everything was . <p> The lights had failed , a perfect seamless night engulfing the world ; and twice t heard a laugh , close and then distant . <p> Then nothing . <p> And I screamed , the loudest sound I could muster lost in the leaves and against the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never existed at all . <p> My jersey . . . where was my jersey . . . ? <p> I made myself stand and think , perfectly alert , trying to remember where it had lain and counting steps in my mind . . . one step , and two , and three . Then I knelt and found nothing in reach , nothing but the rich new soil , and for a terrified instant I wondered if Ula had stolen my clothes , leaving me naked as well as blind . <p> But another step and grope gave me my boots , then the jersey . I dressed and found my various equipment in the pockets and pouches . The portable reader had been cooked by the lightning but the glowglobes were eager . I ignited one of them and released it ; it hovered over me , moving with a faint dry hum as it emitted a yellowish light . <p> I walked to the closest mag-rail . <p> Inoperative . <p> Nearby were a pair of robots standing like statues . <p> Dead . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ula ? Had she gone somewhere , or was she nearby , watching <p> It was fifteen kilometers to the waterfall , the exit . The trees seemed larger in the very weak light , the open jungle floor feeling rather like a place of worship . A cathedral . Then came a wall of vines and thorny brush  --  our earliest plantings  --  and I burrowed into them , pushing despite the stabs at my skin , breaking into an open unfinished glade and pausing . Something was wrong I thought . Against my face was cold air , bitter and sudden . Of course the field generators were down . And the refrigeration elements . What remained ' was the passive emergency system , heat rising into high ducts while others released cubic kilometers of stored air from below . <p> How long would the process take ? <p> I could n't remember , could scarcely think about anything . My jersey automatically warmed me , and I helped keep warm by running fast , pulling ahead of my glowglobe , my frantic shadow gigantic and ethereal . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mathematics . <p> Calories ; volume ; turbulence ; time . <p> Halfway to the waterfall , feeling the distance and the grade , I had a terrible sudden premonition . <p> Slowing , I said , " Where are your " <p> Then I screamed , " Ula ! Ula ! ? " <p> In the chill air my voice carded , and when it died there was a new sound , clear and strong and very distant . A howl ; a wild inhuman moan . I took a weak step sideways and faltered . Somehow I felt as if I should know the source . . . and I remembered Ula 's eight-legged predator , swift and smart and possibly on the hunt now . She had made it . . . ! <p> There was a motion , a single swirling something coming out of the gloom at me . I grunted and twisted , falling down , and a leaf landed at my feet . Brown and cold . Partly cooked by the lightning , I realized . It crumbled when my hand closed around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and again I was running , sprinting uphill , into another band of prickly underbrush and starting to sob with the authority of a beaten child . <p> The ambient temperature was plummeting . <p> My breath showed in my glowglobe 's yellow light , lifting and thinning and mixing with more falling leaves . The forest was slipping into dormancy . A piece of me was thankful , confident that it at least would survive whatever happened ; and most of me was furious with Ula  --  a simple , visceral fury  --  as I imagined my escape and the filing of criminal complaints . Attempted murder . Malicious endangerment . And straight murder charges on Provo , me as witness for the prosecution and their lives here finished . Extinguished . Lost . <p> " I 'm going to escape , " I muttered at the shadows . " Ula ? Are you listening ? Ula ? " <p> I pulled gloves from a pocket , covering my cold hands and them knitting into my sleeves . Then I unrolled my jersey 's simple hood , tying it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric . Leaves were falling in a steady brown blizzard . They covered the freezing earth , crunching with each footfall , and sometimes in the crunches I thought I heard someone or something else moving . Pausing , I would listen . Wait . The predator ? Or Ula ? But the next howl seemed distant and perhaps confused , and it had to be the girl whom I heard . Who would n't be fooled with my stop and then go and stop again tricks . <p> The cavern 's upper end was bitter cold . One of our emergency ducts had opened up beside the entranceway , robbing the heat from the water and ground and trees . Already the pond was freezing , the ice clear and hard , very nearly flawless . I ran on its shore , squinting into the gloom , believing that at least the cliche , the falls , would have stopped flowing when the power failed . Not in an instant , no . But its reservoir was relatively small  --  Ula had shown me her plans  --  and for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imminent . <p> What was that ? From the gloom came an apparent wall of marble , white and thick and built where the cliche had been . Frozen . . . the waterfall had frozen clear through . . . ! <p> I moaned , screamed , and slowed . <p> Beside the pond was one of the useless robots . I moved to it , my breath freezing against the ceramic skin , and with a few desperate tugs I managed to pry free one of its hands . The hand was meant for cutting , for chopping and I held it like an axe , growling at my audience . " What did you think ? That I 'd just give up now ? " <p> No answer . The only sounds were the falling of leaves and the occasional creaking pop as sap froze inside the sleeping trees . <p> I moved to the icy shelf at the base of the falls , shuffling to where I normally walked through , where the ice should be thinnest . Three times I swung , twice without force and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough as marble and more slippery . My axe slid sideways , twisting me . Then my boots moved , my balance lost , and I hit the icy shelf , slid , and fell again . <p> The pond caught me . The ice beneath gave with the impact , a slight but deep cracking sound lasting for an age . But I did n't tall through . And when I could breathe again , with pain , I stood and hobbled over to the shore , trying very hard not to give in . <p> " Is this what you did to the others ? " I asked . <p> Silence . <p> " Is this how you treat lovers , Ula ? " <p> A howl , almost close , sudden and very shrill . <p> A primeval thought came to me . I made myself approach the black jungle , scooping up leaves by the armful and building a substantial pile of them where I had sat with Provo , against the downed log . And I lit them and the log on fire with a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the globe detonating with a wet sizzle , the dried leaves exploding into a smoky red fire . <p> The odd sugars loved to burn , the flames hot and quick and delicious . They ignited the log within minutes , giving me a sense of security . The canopy did n't reach overhead . I made doubly sure that the surrounding ground had no leaves , no way for the fire to spread ; then I set to work , armfuls of fresh leaves piled against the cliche , tamped them down with my boots until there was a small hill spilling onto the pond . <p> Heat versus ice . <p> Equations and estimates kept me focused , unafraid . <p> Then I felt ready , using the axe to knock loose a long splinter of burning log . I carried the cold end , shouting , " See ? See ? I 'm not some idiot . I 'm not staying in your trap , Ula ! " I touched the leaf pile in a dozen places , then retreated , keeping at what felt like a safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing over me , almost nourishing me for the moment . <p> Those sugars were wonderfully potent . Almost explosive . <p> Ula must have planned to burn me alive , I kept thinking . She would have lit the leaf litter when it was deep enough . . . only I 'd beaten her timetable , had n't I ? <p> " I 'll file charges , " I promised the red-lit trees . " You should have done a better job , my dear . " <p> A sharp howl began , then abruptly stopped . It was as if a recording had been turned off m its middle . <p> Then came a crashing sound , and I turned to see a single chunk of softened ice breaking free of the cliche , crashing into my fire and throwing sparks in every direction . Watching the sparks , I felt worry and a sudden fatigue . What 's wrong ? My eyes lifted , maybe out of instinct , and I noticed a single platter-sized leaf still rising , glowing red and obviously different from the other leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically soared overhead . Just like a fire eagle , it rode a thermal . . . and did n't it resemble an eagle ? A little bit ? One species of tree among hundreds , and Ula must have designed it , and she must have seen that it was planted here  --  <p>  --  such an elaborate , overly complicated plan . Contrived and plainly artificial , I was thinking . Part of me felt superior and critical . Even when I knew the seriousness of everything , watching that leaf vanish into great blackness overhead . . . out of the thermal now , gliding off in some preplanned direction , no doubt . . . even then I felt remarkably unafraid , knowing that that leaf would surely reach the canopy somewhere , igniting hundreds of leaves and the sappy young branches . . . and part of me wanted nothing more than to take my student aside , ann around her shoulders , while I said , " Now listen . This is all very clever , and I 'm sure it 's cruel , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to do it . By tomorrow . That 's your assignment , Ula . Will you do it for me , please ? " <p> The forest caught fire . <p> I heard the fire before I saw the ruddy glow of it . It sounded like a grinding wind , strong and coming nearer ; then came the crashing of softened ice , blocks and slush dropping onto my fire and choking it out completely . <p> I did n't have time or the concentration to build another fire <p> Towering red flames were streaking through the cavern , first in the canopy and then lower , igniting whole trunks that would explode . I heard them , and I felt the detonations against my face and through my toes . The air itself began to change , tasting warm and sooty , ashes against my teeth and tongue . Transfixed , I stood in the clearing beside the pond , thick and twisting black columns of smoke rising the ceiling lit red and the smoke pooling against it , forming an inverted lake full of swirling superheated gases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I heard someone speaking , close and harsh . . . and after a few moments of hard concentration I realized it was my voice , senseless angry sounds bubbling out of me . . . and I clamped a hand over my mouth , fingers into a cheek and tears mixed with the stinking ash . . . I was crying . . . I had been crying for a very long while . . . . <p> I would die here . <p> Always crying , I struggled with prosaic calculations . Calories from combustion ; oxygen consumed ; the relative toughness of human flesh . But my numbers collapsed , too much stress and too little time remaining . Part of the firestorm was coming back at me now , trunks burning and splitting open as the fiery sap boiled ; but I would n't burn to death , I decided . Because what felt like a finger struck me on top of my head , in my hair , and I looked up just as a second gooey drop of water found me . It dripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasted it  --  smoke and ash mixed with a sharp , almost chemical aftertaste  --  <p>  --  melted ice from the faraway roof  --  <p>  --  unfrozen , ancient seawater . <p> The black lake of churning smoke was its deepest straight above me , and those first drops became multitudes , fat and forceful . Like rain , then harder . They hammered me to the ground , my head dropping and my hands held above it , shielding very little , and squinting eyes able to see the oncoming fire begin to slow , to drown . <p> I thought of the falls melting with this onslaught , but I could n't stand , much less move . The mud under me seemed to suck , holding me in place . I was squarely beneath an enormous waterfall  --  no cliche  --  and I would have laughed , given the breath . <p> Funny , fun Ula . <p> Perhaps the largest waterfall in the Realm , I was thinking . For this moment , at least . And my mind 's eye lent me a safe vantage point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroying it too . And somewhere I realized that by now I had to be dead , that breathing had to be impossible , that I only believed I was breathing because death had to be a continuation of life , a set of habits maintained . What a lovely , even charming wonder . I felt quite calm , quite happy . Hearing the roar of water , aware of the soil and trees and rock itself being obliterated . . . my bones and pulverized meat mixed into the stew . . . and how sweet that I could retain my limbs , my face and mouth and heart , as a ghost . I thought . Touching myself in the noisy blackness , I found even my soaked jersey intact . . . no , not total blackness ; there was a dim glow from above . . . and I began to sit upright , thinking like a ghost , wondering about my powers and wishing that my soul could lift now , lift and fly away . <p> But instead , with unghostly force , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I staggered , groaned , and reached out with both hands , discovering a blister of transparent hyperglass above me . Enclosing me . Larger than a coffin , but not by much . . . it must have been deployed at the last possible instant , air pumped in from below , seals designed to withstand this abuse . . . a safety mechanism not shown on any schematic , obviously . . . and I was alive , slippery wet and numb but undeniably organic . . . . <p> . . . and unalone as well . <p> Rising from the mud beside me , visible in that thin cool light , was a naked form  --  artist ; torturers Nature Herself  --  who calmly and with great dignity wiped the mud from her eyes and grinning mouth . And she bent , the mouth to my ear , asking me over the great roar , " So what have you learned today , student ? " <p> I could n't speak , could barely think . <p> Opening my jersey , she kissed my bare chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little illusion . " <p> Yet in my head it was real , even now . <p> " I would never intentionally hurt , " she promised . " Not you , not anyone . " <p> I wanted to believe her . <p> " I always watched over you , Hann . I never blinked . " <p> Thank you . <p> " I 'm not cruel . " A pause . " It 's just  --  " <p> Yes ? <p> "  --  I wanted to show you  --  " <p> What ? <p> "  --  what ? What have I shown you , darling ? " <p> Squinting , I gazed up through the thick blister , the black water churning more slowly , cooling and calming itself . My mind became lucid , answers forming and my mouth opening and her anticipating the moment , her hand tasting of earth as it closed my mouth again . <p> We lay quietly together , as if in a common grave . <p> For two days we waited , the water refreezing around us and neither of us speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence . A contemplative , enlightening silence . I built worlds in my head  --  great and beautiful and true , full of the frailties and powers of life  --  then came the gnawing and pounding of robots . Half-burned trees were jerked free and tossed aside . The ice itself was peeled away from the blister . I saw motions , then stars . Then a familiar stocky figure . Provo Lei peered in at us , the round face furious and elated in equal measures ; and as he began to cut us free , in those last moments of solitude , I turned to Ula and finally spoke . <p> " You never wanted to terraform worlds , " I blurted . <p> " Worlds are tiny , " she said with contempt . Her liquid smile was lit by the cutting laser , and a green eye winked as she said , " Tell me , Hann . What do I care about ? " <p> Something larger than worlds , I knew <p>  --  and I understood , in an instant  --  <p>  --  but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst through the hyperglass and stole my chance . Suddenly Ula had changed , becoming the pouting little girl , her lower lip stuck out and a plaintive voice crying , " Oh , Father . I 'm such a clumsy goof , Father . I 'm sorry , so sorry . Will you ever forgive me ? Please , please ? " <p> <p> By Robert Reed <p> Robert Reed is having a good year .
