If you see a colored person sitting on the bench in front of the Salt Sr Palm Condominium in Boca Raton , Florida , do not think she is a resident . No , she is working for somebody , waiting for her ride . She is probably a visiting nurse come to give someone an enema . Or a maid . At the front desk , Jacob buzzes in the visitors and others . Those he does n't recognize , he telephones about . The carpet in the lobby is bright green with a band of paler green running up and down its angles , like a lawn , only more everlasting . There are stripes everywhere on the upholstery and a glass-topped coffee table in the shape of a swimming pool and a multitude of fake plants . Once in a while someone puts a real vase of flowers on the table , and this fools everyone who is used to the artificial . It is hard to tell what from what . I am very sleepy . <p> My employer is called Jim M . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself in this story I intend to publish and he decides to sue . Not that he is the type to sue . These people as a rule , do n't sue . Also , Mr. M , who I do not mean to slander , has had a stroke and is very forgetful and disoriented , which is why I am here . <p> During the day I push him to the poolside in his wheelchair . His yellow sweater is around his shoulders , and on his head is a canvas hat with a plaid band . To me , he is very beautiful-small bones , tiny flat ears , his slacks always with a good crease , and nice shoes with white laces . His hair is silver and as thin as a halo and exceptionally well-behaved . As is Jim himself , a perfect gentleman , even though he is highly confused and does not always know which end is up . Poor Jim . In private I call him Jim . <p> " Penny for your thoughts , " he said the other day . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal for handholding . I am sure there are those who see us around the pool and feel-I am trying to imagine what they feel-disgusted . <p> Mrs. M , who I always call Mrs. M- , is sometimes , I am sure , embarrassed by his behavior . " Give us a little kiss , " he said the other day to the daughter of one of the residents . I had to laugh to myself because the daughter , who I will call Louise , took a backwards step and almost fell into the pool . She had dark hair twisted up and kept in place with a wooden spike . " That 's a nice thing , " I told her about the spike . Then she kissed him , and a look crossed her face . I know the feeling . His cheek like a moth , as if you were kissing something fluttering , about to fly apart . One good swat , and the pieces of Mr. M would turn to dust . I like my job . <p> Mrs. M is the opposite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she plunges into the water , she creates an enormous fan-shaped spray on either side of her top half , like the prow of a ship . She has a forceful voice and is of course much more practical than Mr. M- . You 'd never catch Mrs. M smiling at a bird or throwing pebbles to a baby . You 'd never catch her dribbling a little water on her pant leg just to watch the spot spread out . She does everything very fastzip zip zip-she swims , she towels , she slaps on the Coppertone , she showers , she eats . She tells me , " Do n't you think he needs a sweater today ? It 's a little chilly . " Or " I was thinking he might like a ham sandwich and a pickle , and I 'll have the same , thank you , dear . " Mrs. M and I do not have conversations , and she never calls me by my name . In both these ways she 's like my mother . <p> My mother who is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any white people , God strike her dead . " Mama , I 'm not a maid . I am a companion . A companion is different from a maid , " I explain . " Idiot , " she says . " Do you or do you not fix they 's lunches ? " " I may , on occasion , make a sandwich for two old people who can no longer do for themselves , yes , Mother . " " Do you or do you not vacuum clean ? Do you or do you not wash they 's dishes ? " My mother has eyes that could snap off the branch of a tree . " Answer me that . " <p> This is what 's true : When I go home at night , I am still in some part of my brain at the Salt &; Palm sitting beside Jim and holding his hand or giving him sips of water from a paper cone or folding his yellow sweater and putting it on a shelf in his closet . I am still there with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drapes with the parrot print at the waterway boats and the shimmery gray waves and the beautiful flower beds and lawns . <p> I know you are thinking the obvious , but it is not that simple . I do not want their things . What I would like is to be able to fall asleep in his California King with the lacy pillowcases-not for the purpose of luxury , but for the purpose of understanding . This is what you have to realize about me since this is the story of me , I am its central character , and Mr. and Mrs. M and all the folks around the pool and crossing and recrossing the green carpeting are subsidiary to me . Which is not the same in real life . <p> Here is my main point : The Salt &; Palm Condominium , situated on a strip of land bordering the Gulf Stream Waterway in Boca Raton , Florida , is a sand-colored building whose insides duplicate the lawn and the hedges surrounding it . There are one- , two- , and three-bedroom units . Each has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tall , drifting boats . The youngest inhabitants are in their sixties , and the oldest are pushing one hundred . Mostly retirees , though there are one or two well-preserved blond ladies who have jobs in the village . These are the questions which arise : What do the inhabitants of the Salt &; Palm think about all day ? And also : How is it that they take it all in stride ? The boxy hedge and the gardeners who clip them , the poolside geraniums , the unwavering lawn , the waterway with its silver dazzles ducking around the little dock ? The white plastic chaises , the grandchildren , the lunchtimes and dinnertimes , the clear pool always without bugs and twigs , the chrome railings gleaming like celestial bodies ? And those other bodies with pedicures and hairdos and the lazy , ringed , freckled fingers reaching for the Bain de Soleil ? And the slick , orange , hairless legs ? Because I do n't understand what these bodies contain other than themselves . As a student of creative writing , I am compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tired , sometimes I wish I were dead . <p> To be truthful , I 'm a little in love with Jim . Of all the bodies here , his is the most delicate and lovely . His skin is the color of glass . If you stand behind him at a certain time of day , you can see through the tip of his ear . Lord Jim , I call him , after one of those big schooners that comes into the waterway . When Louise heard me say it , she said , " Oh , Conrad , " showing off . She and I have gotten friendly . " These people , " she hisses-Louise hisses- " are total bigots . I just hope you realize that . " She means well , but she is not a writer . She does n't have the curiosity to put up with things . I try to explain about Mrs. M ' s nightgown , a fulllength nightgown , pure white with pale blue satin bows on the lace straps and little tucks above a cluster of snowy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too small for Mrs. M now-is a symbol . " You 're a romantic , " Louise says . <p> At home my mother makes an apple pie . She is standing in her bra rolling out the crust . She swears a blue streak . She hates making pies . Now here is a person whose insides are full of crevices and whorls . Also , she is divorced . She 's always reminded me of that tragic fact . " I am a divorced woman , Maryann , and in this world a single woman better know where she 's at , or there 'll be hell to pay to the piper . " She is still mad at me for working at the Salt &; Palm , even though it brings a good income . " Shit and damn , " she says as she flops the crust into a glass dish . The kitchen light is grimy and dim due to the one bulb that 's burned out in the overhead fixture . When she tried to repair it the other day , a little explosion followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she better let sleeping dogs lie . I wanted to point out that there was nothing " sleeping " about a near electrocution , but these days she is so prickly with me , I did not dare . As a creative writing exercise , I take note of things as if for the first time : the row of metal canisters with dents on each of the lids , the lettering all faded on the SUGAR ; a pile of laundry on a chair ; shoes under the table since last week . Through our window with the dusty yellow valance , a depressing view of Mr. Oliphant 's old , rusted Ford Falcon and our own clothesline with a green towel slapping in the wind . All this reminds me of the Salt &; Palm and its calmness and beauty . I hear some kids screaming on their bicycles , and I can not help but make a comparison . <p> My mother scratches under the strap of her bra . " Fuck and hell , " she says , " I got to lose some of this poundage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In figure she is not unlike Mrs. M , though I have never seen , nor do I wish to see , Mrs. M in a bra . <p> Once the pie 's in the oven , Mama looks me over . Her eyes are hot , and instinctively I flinch as if she would hit me , though she 's never hit me . " What you looking at ? " she says . " I know what you 're thinking , do n't think I do n't . " She looks around the room , and I see a small sadness crease her face before she marches out . <p> This is when I recall with shame what I did today when Mrs. M had gone shopping and Mr. M was taking his p.m. nap . I went to the closet and removed the nightgown from its pink hanger . At first I only held it up to the window . It was so beautiful , the light poured into it and dazzled on the snowy pleats , the little tucks underneath the bodice . Then , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full-length , I looked a way in which I 'd never seen myself as if the light had filled my body as well as the nightgown . You may think this is a vague metaphor , but it is the truth . I had become the light , and I had also become the nightgown . I myself : snowy , white , soft . I wish I could describe the feeling . At first I wanted to cry , and then I became dizzy . Luckily , I managed to take it off and neatly fold it and put it away before Mrs. M returned . Then I walked over to Jim , who was still napping , his head to one side on the pillow and drool coming out of the side of his lip . It crossed my mind I could kill him so easily . Just pick up a pillow and stuff it in his face . It would n't take hardly any strength . <p> I am looking out the window at the clothesline , and it 's getting darker outside so that the green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silhouette that reminds me of a bat . I 've always been good at description . Mr. Oliphant 's old , rusty car is a medium-sized whale against the gray sky , and the one or two smudged stars which are trying to shine on our roof are like bottle caps at the bottom of a puddle . Of course I do not really want a nightgown such as the one I tried on this afternoon . What I want is the feeling of the nightgown . But , as I 've already mentioned , it is hard to write down exactly what the feeling is . When I figure it out , I will insert it into this story , which I believe is drawing to a close . <p>
