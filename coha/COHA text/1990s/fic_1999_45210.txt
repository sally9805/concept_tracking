After reading The Stranger in honors French , my friend John claimed that God was irrelevant , and cashed in the four-yearold savings bonds he got from his Bar Mitzvah . He bought a 1966 Pontiac GTO from a guy in Auburndale , and left the little plastic Jesus on the dashboard to illustrate his point . <p> " The human condition is absurd , " he said . <p> " It is around here , " I agreed . <p> Besides discussing philosophy , we saw a lot of movies . John had a scam going with the kids who worked at the nearby Chestnut Hill cinema . His summer job was fry cook at Friendly 's in Chestnut Hill . When the kids from the cinema came in to eat , he 'd double or triple their order , mounding up the French fries , and stacking extra bacon on the bacon cheeseburgers . In return , they would leave some movie passes under their plates . The waitresses were in on it , too . We fell into a pattern of eating at Friendly 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch , but did because they were free . <p> As we drove toward the movies that night , in John 's Pontiac , the woods and big trees off Hammond Pond Parkway reminded me of Mrs. Kensington 's garden . I had n't mentioned to him or anyone what I had discovered behind her high brick wall on Arlington Street . <p> " You smell like French fries , " I said , instead . <p> " What 's that supposed to mean ? " <p> " It does n't mean anything . I thought you might like to know you smell like French fries . " <p> " I 'm not outside all day . I have to actually do something . There 's a lot of pressure on me , you know . " <p> " Like what ? Remembering the ingredients in a BLT ? " <p> " If it was n't for my job , we would n't be going to the movies , would we ? " <p> John was right . At lunch , he would have six or seven sandwiches cooking on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of those little green order sheets onto the spinning chrome wheel above his grill . John methodically flipped the burgers and shook the waffle-cut fries out of their baskets . He had a long handled spatula that he used to ring a bell on top of the counter when the order was up . <p> I kept my mouth shut , happy to be tan and free of the Fryolator odor that clung to John , even after he showered . <p> That summer , I was a tree surgeon 's assistant . My expensive habit of buying collectible cereal boxes had exhausted my small savings . John 's parents made him work because they said he needed structure . My parents begged me to focus on more legitimate issues , like college . <p> I had a wall of narrow shelves in my room where I kept some of the cheesier boxes on display , like the spooky General Mills trio from the 70 's , Count Chocula , Boo Berry , and Frankenberry . They were good boxes , but not worth what the Wheaties were with Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still inside . <p> I was never as interested in baseball cards or comic books as I was in the brightly colored world of breakfast cereal . Before I was old enough to read the paper in the mornings , I would study the boxes as I lapped up bowl after bowl , longing to find the Honeycomb Hideout , or Cap'n Crunch 's buried treasure . <p> Last year , on a hunch , I bought a couple of cases of a cereal with Vanessa Williams on the cover . Then the old pictures she did for Penthouse surfaced , and they took away her Miss America title . The regionally distributed Corn Flakes boxes were now going for $25 each . <p> I had made the mistake in sixth grade of doing a presentation about my hobby in school . We were supposed to give presentations about our outside interests . Virtually every other kid talked about scouting , Pop Warner football , or brownies . At the last minute , because I did n't have any other outside interests , I grabbed a shopping bag and filled it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had collected and gave my report . Five years later the kids still called me " Sir Grapefellow . " <p> Bruce Walker , my boss , was a certified Arborist . It was painted on the side of his truck . Bruce never let me work the high stuff in the trees , which he did wearing a belay rope and harness . My job was to pile up the branches he cut and feed them into the orange Asplundh tree chipper . The Asplundh could turn a tree trunk as thick as a telephone pole into mulch in about four seconds . I never got tired of reducing trees into sawdust , piece by piece . <p> Bruce only cut trees down if there was no way to save them . He could do things like drill in cables to support the branches , or even inject medicine into the trees infested with termites . I had been working for Bruce on Saturdays for more than a month when we went to Mrs. Kensington 's place . She lived on West Newton Hill , and there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick wall I could see the tops of huge beeches , chestnuts , and hemlocks . <p> Bruce sat at the wheel of his Ford F350 , and rubbed his forehead with his stained leather work gloves . <p> " Do you want to be a tree surgeon when you grow up ? " he asked . <p> " I do n't know . Do you have to go to medical school ? " <p> " OK , wise guy . Is there a possibility , if you flunk out of college or something , and your woman leaves you , and there are no other jobs available , that you would seek employment in this line of work ? " <p> " Well , sure , I guess so . " <p> " Then I recommend you stay in the truck for a while . " <p> Bruce sighed , and hopped out . He walked through the gate and up the steps to the house . I heard dogs barking , and the door swung open before his extended finger had reached the bell . I tried to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far down the street . I got out . <p> Bruce was trying to show an old lady with a huge black wig the estimates he worked out on a clipboard . She was thin , and it looked like an overweight cat was draped on her head . Three Airedales were jumping against the screen door , which she held closed with her heel . I started to move up the walk , which sent the dogs into a frenzy , and I stopped in the middle of the path . <p> Her property extended back to a line of scrub pines maybe a hundred yards away . The high brick wall enclosed the whole property . There was a courtyard behind the house with an empty fountain , and huge beech trees ringed a slate-roofed gazebo . There was a small pond next to an old weeping willow . Fieldstone paths weaved between hedges , and benches were placed here and there . It was like the grounds of some English duke . <p> " Well , another fine looking assistant for Mr. Walker , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a call from his parole officer to see if I 'd , you know , give him a chance . He 's been in and out of jails since he was 12 . " <p> " What did he do ? " <p> " Car theft . Bad checks . Bunko . " <p> " It 's nice of you to give him a job , " Mrs. Kensington said . <p> " The sad part is , he comes from a good home . Say hi to our new boss for the next week or so , Kenny . " <p> " Hi Mrs. Kensington . I just want to tell you that .... " <p> " Oh , I trust you , Ken . It 's Bruce you should thank for giving you a break . " <p> That night a girl we had never seen before tore our tickets as we headed into the movie . She made as if to give John his stub , then pulled her hand back . <p> " Are you the food guy ? " she asked . Her new General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids that worked there had to wear a name tag , and the red shirt with the goofy projector logo on it , just like John had to wear a paper Friendly 's hat . She had rolled the sleeve up a couple of times , showing lean , lightly muscled arms . It gave her the same defiant look John tried for when he wore the paper hat tipped way back on his head . She also had on baggy , fatigue army pants . <p> " Maybe , " John said . He was always looking for a set up . <p> " Do you work lunch tomorrow ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " Well , I 'm coming in . " <p> " So ? " <p> " So fire up that grill , tough guy , " she said , and flicked his ticket stub into his chest . <p> We walked in silence up the plush , red carpeted aisle and into the theater . <p> " Where did she come from ? " John said . <p> " Not around here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie let out , we cornered Turner , the shrimpy projectionist who also went to our high school . <p> " Who is she ? " John said . " And who told her about the food ? " <p> " What 's her name ? " I said , leaning into him a little . <p> " Jen . " <p> " Jen what ? " John and I said at the same time . <p> Turner looked around , and motioned us through a door into the inner sanctum of the projection booth . It was stuffy , cluttered with gigantic cans of film , and smelled like the dark room in John 's basement . <p> " She 's the girl from St. Johnsbury . " <p> In April , the year before , around the same time John and I were taking the SATs , a girl from Dover disappeared while hitchhiking . For four days , the story led the local news . Since she was also a high school junior , and since Dover was only three towns away , everyone talked a lot about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere , " John said . <p> " Yeah , " I said . <p> " Maybe there 's a Ted Bundy guy running around . " <p> " She 's the only one who 's missing though , " I said . <p> " Then it was drugs . Definitely drugs , " John concluded . <p> The newspapers made a big deal about it because she was an honors student and because her parents said she never got rides that way . Our high school responded in a typical fashion , by having an assembly about the dangers of hitchhiking . A beefy Newton cop stood at the podium . <p> " It may seem like a good way to get somewhere , but it 's really a good way to get in a dangerous situation , " the cop said . Everyone cheered , and the principal , who was also up on the stage , yanked his tie and glared at us . <p> He cleared his throat , " People who pick up hitchhikers may be using it as an excuse to peddle drugs .... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . He quoted a few FBI statistics , and then added , " If Jennifer Carlton was your sister , I wonder how you 'd act , " which was supposed to make us feel guilty . <p> Before John got the GTO , we tried to hitchhike , but no one would pick us up . We talked about how people were probably scared of us , but I honestly thought it was because we looked lame and desperate . <p> The story broke nationally when Jen appeared outside St. Johnsbury , Vermont . She walked into an IGA grocery store , and said she had been kidnapped . She eluded her captors by climbing out the window of a gas station rest room , and hiding in the woods . <p> She told police that two guys in a gray van had pulled her off of Route 16 . They were taking her to Canada . Although she was blindfolded , she was able to describe the tattoos the men had on their forearms , Satanic pictures and upside down crosses . They took her to a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around her wrists . John and I watched her interviewed on the local news . <p> " It was very uncomfortable , because my hands were tied most of the time , " Jen said . She had long , black hair and far away eyes . She was not enjoying the focus of the camera . <p> " And you were in the van for three days ? " " Yes . " <p> " And how were you treated ? " <p> " OK , I guess . " <p> " The two men who kidnapped you have n't been found . Has this experience changed the way the way you feel about society ? " <p> Jen arched her eyebrows at the camera . " I 've never thought much of society , " she answered . <p> I had no way of knowing if Jen would show up to eat that afternoon . I figured if I told Bruce my friend was working the grill at Friendly 's , he 'd want to eat there . John and I had n't said anything more to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that something was finally going to happen . It was n't just that she had flicked his ticket stub at him . The halls of Newton North High School were filled with girls who would throw things to make a point . Jen was a celebrity . I found myself wondering why she wore those army pants with the big side pockets , if she shoplifted in them , or carried a knife . <p> Bruce and I slid into a booth , and he flipped open a menu . I told him to go for it and walked back to the grill to talk to John . There were some kids eating from the theater , but Jen was n't with them . John had three or four burgers sizzling in front of him , and was peeking under the buns to make sure they did n't burn . <p> " What 's up ? " I asked . <p> " You see it , brother , " he answered . Then Jen walked in . <p> She sat at the counter , acknowledged the two of us with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass Friendly 's ashtray with her smoke . <p> " Excuse me a second . . . I have a customer , " John said , and quickly slid down the counter to where she sat , like he was a waitress . <p> " Hi . Jen , right ? What can I get for you ? " John asked . I followed him down the counter and hopped on the stool next to Jen . <p> " Can I get those two coffees ? " I asked . <p> " What coffees ? " John said . <p> " The two coffees I ordered . " <p> " Ask your waitress . Your party is seated at a booth . " <p> " Do I look like I 'm at a booth ? Come on John , we only have like 20 minutes to eat . " <p> " OK. " he said . Smoke was rising from the grill and he had to hustle over and move stuff around that was starting to burn . <p> " How do you like working at the theater ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess . You know , free movies . My shrink says I need structure . " <p> " I work for a tree surgeon . With a tree chipper . " <p> " Wow . " <p> John plunked two cups down in front of me , and half the coffee sloshed over the rims and into the saucers . <p> " Drink up , " he said . <p> Bruce was looking at his watch in the booth , so I had to bring the coffees over and we ordered . Although I could n't hear what the two of them were saying , Jen 's raucous laughter made everyone in the restaurant wonder what was going on . <p> Later , when we were putting the tools away and getting ready to go home , Bruce said , " I suppose you 're pretty busy in the fall . " <p> " I 'm kind of busy , " I said . Honestly , it seemed like the only difference was that John and I looked for indoor places to drink when it got cold . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow plows in the winter . I want you to work for me . Can you run a snowplow ? " <p> " Piece of cake , " I said , slamming the truck 's tailgate closed . <p> John picked me up that night as usual , and I was immediately suspicious by an unfamiliar odor in his car . <p> " Do you have a new deodorizer in here ? " I asked , half expecting to see a little pine tree hanging from the rear view mirror . <p> " No , " he said . <p> " What 's that smell ? " <p> " It might be my Old Spice . " <p> " Old Spice ? " <p> " You do n't know what Old Spice is ? " <p> " I 've never smelled it on you , is all . " <p> " I wear it . " <p> " My ass . What 's going on ? " <p> " Jen is coming out with us , " John said . <p> " What do you mean , with ' us ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " No , it 's not a date . If it was a date , I would n't bring you , would I ? " <p> " Thanks a lot , " I said , " Is there anything else I need to know ? " <p> " Relax . She asked us what we did around here , and I said , hang out ' . She wanted to come . She does n't know anyone around here , you know . Just think of something fun to do . " <p> " Since when are we the Welcome Wagon ? " I asked . <p> I leaned back against the seat . He drove like nothing was any different , elbow hanging out the window , head nodding slightly back and forth with the beat from the radio . He started to tell me about a scene at Friendly 's that day where some younger kids tried the old " Dine and Dash " trick , and had been run down in the parking lot by two waitresses . I was not appreciating it the way I usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cant hooks to chop up a tree . <p> " Listen , I know where we can go , " I said . <p> We picked Jen up at her house in Newtonville . It was an ordinary split level , with a rusted basketball hoop at a crazy angle over the garage . John and I had barely pulled to the curb when Jen slammed the front door and bounded down the steps . She motioned for me to get out , like she wanted to sit in front . I opened the door , and was prepared to hop in the back , when she slid over on the bench seat toward John and patted the seat next to her . <p> " Let 's drive around redneck style . Who 's the Jesus freak ? " she asked , eying the plastic figure glued to the dash . <p> " John does n't believe in God , " I explained . <p> " I do n't get it , " she said . <p> " Were n't your parents home ? " John asked . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't they want to , I do n't know .... " <p> " They go way overboard when it comes to trusting me these days , " she said . <p> It was no problem slipping over the brick wall and into Mrs. Kensington 's garden . We were pretty far from the house , and I knew she never let the dogs roam around by themselves . We crept between the high hedges , and along stone paths lit by moonlight . It was quiet , until we came upon the big , slate-roofed gazebo that rose up next to the pond . <p> " Holy shit , " Jen said . <p> " Shh ! " I hissed . <p> " Sorry , sorry , " she said in a whisper . <p> We went up the stone steps , and sat on the benches that faced the water . The house was probably a hundred yards away , but we still spoke in low voices . <p> " Kenny , you really work here ? " Jen asked . She cupped her match , and kept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the way the soldiers smoked in war movies when they did n't want some sniper blowing their head off . <p> " We take care of the trees , " I said . <p> " Who lives in that house ? " <p> " This old lady . " <p> Jen had a joint , and we smoked it . We listened to John babble about The Stranger ; how this guy Mersault killed an Arab , and felt up his girlfriend at the beach , but remained totally indifferent to everything , even when he was going to be executed . <p> " It was his philosophy , you see , " John explained . <p> " How much longer are you going to work here ? " Jen asked me . <p> " We have to get rid of the dead trees . Sometimes we fool around with the tree chipper . Bruce 's wife makes him these meatloaf sandwiches that she thinks he likes , and he throws them in . When it comes out , it looks like someone puked . " <p> " Gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nudging me with the toe of her suede Puma sneaker . <p> " I feel that breakfast is the most important meal of the day , " I said . <p> " What ? " she asked . <p> " Kenny 's got this cereal thing , " John said . <p> " You do n't eat cereal ? " I asked her . <p> " I eat cereal , " Jen said . " I like cereal . " <p> " O.K , then , " I said . <p> " They call Kenny Sir Grapefellow ' . " <p> " They used to , " I explained . " In like sixth grade . For only a week . You see , many classic lines of cereals came in two different flavors . The collectible ones , I mean . The ones worth money . For example , Sir Grapefellow and Baron Von Redberry . Quisp and Quake . Count Chocula and Frankenberry . " <p> " Yeah . I remember those . But how are they worth money ? " And why did they call you Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little like the guy on the box , " John said . <p> " I did not . I happened to be wearing purple the day I brought in some boxes for a presentation , all right ? The boxes are what 's worth money . People collect them the way they collect lunch boxes or Barbie dolls . I have a 1962 Frosted Flakes box that 's worth about three hundred bucks . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " They printed the box wrong . Tony the Tiger apears bloatede , " I said . <p> " How interesting , " Jen said . <p> Bruce put down the McCullough chain saw , and walked around the east side of the gazebo , the side that faced the lake . <p> " What the hell is this ? " he asked , calling me over . I was terrified he had found some evidence of my nighttime visit . <p> Set in the stone foundation was a step down to a small , iron door . It was invisible from the rest of the yard . Bruce grabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunlight showed ladder rungs dropping down into the darkness . It smelled stale . <p> " It 's probably where she keeps her husband , " I said . <p> " It 's a bomb shelter . Look , " he indicated the yellow and black fallout shelter symbol on the back wall . " Lots of families around here put them in in the 50 's . I bet it was a good business . " Bruce leaned on the door to shut it . <p> " Do you think there 's stuff down there ? " I asked . <p> " Oh , yeah . They stocked them with food , water , cots . Everything you need to survive nuclear war . Provided you would want to . " <p> " It seems like a strange place to have one , though . Are n't they usually in the basement ? " <p> " Yeah , but look who we 're dealing with , a woman who wo n't even let us use her toilet , " Bruce said . " Hey , how 's that girl ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Why do you say it like that ? " I asked . <p> " No offense . I just wonder what she 's like . " <p> " She 's really nice , " I said . <p> " Does she ever talk about what happened ? " Bruce asked . <p> " No . She sort of talks about how things affect her , though . " <p> " I 'll bet . " <p> " What are you trying to say ? " <p> " I remember watching the whole thing on TV . She just seemed a little smug when she showed up . Like how she refused to do hardly any interviews . " <p> " I 'd like to see how you 'd act if you were tied up in a van for three days , " I said . <p> " Easy . I 'm just telling you how I felt . I 'm just being honest . " <p> " She has no friends . She just moved here . " <p> " Well , then , it 's nice of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me off at Friendly 's , and I sat on the curb and waited for John to finish up inside , and hopefully snag us some sandwiches . There was a shrill whistle from across the parking lot , and I saw Jen talking to a guy in a Lincoln . She came over and sat down next to me . <p> " Who was that ? " <p> " Ralph . He 's the assistant manager at the theater . I call him RAAAALPH , " she said , like she was puking . " He 's trying to get into my pants . He does n't even make me sweep . " <p> " Well , that 's something , " I said . <p> " Yeah . School 's weird , too . Everyone there is afraid to make me do anything , " Jen said . I knew she was going to Dana Hall , this private girls ' school in Wellesley . They were making her go to summer school , but she hardly attended any classes . Jen 's psychiatrist had given her a note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she was stressed . The note said something about duress . <p> " I never go to the gym , " she told me . <p> " I do n't blame you , " I said . <p> I 'm seriously thinking about quitting the theatre , too . " <p> " Because of Ralph ? " <p> " No I do n't need the money , either . This guy keeps trying to get my parents to sell him the rights to my story . " <p> " What guy ? " <p> " A TV guy . You know those movie-of-the-week things . " <p> " For how much ? " I asked . <p> " Kenny ! It 's so . . . exploitive . God . " <p> " Sorry . It 's just that you 're the first person I 've known that has a story . No one has a story around here . " <p> " The teachers at Dana Hall treat me like I 'm an invalid . I ca n't imagine what 's going to happen when the regular school year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without doing jack shit . " <p> " You could write a book , " I said . <p> " Yeah , right . " <p> " You could . About how you were . . . so . . . resourceful . " <p> " Do you think I 'm resourceful , Kenny ? " <p> She lit a cigarette , and blew the smoke out of the side of her mouth . I wondered if she looked the same way before the whole thing happened . It reminded me of this thing Bruce once told me about the guys who came back from Vietnam . He said you could tell who had been in combat because they had this far away look in their eyes he called the " thousand yard stare . " <p> " You must be . You 're here , right ? " <p> " And not chopped in some hole in Canada ? " <p> " Jen , " I saud . <p> " That 's what you meant . " <p> " But it makes me uncomfortable . It 's uncomfortable for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't raped , if that 's what your implying , " Jen said . <p> " Jesus Christ ! Who said anything about rape ? " <p> " I know that 's what you thought . It 's what everybody thought . " <p> " It 's none of my business one way or the other , " I said . <p> " Are n't you curious ? Everyone else is . My psychiatrist practically drools when I start talking about being in the van . " <p> " If you want to talk about it , then . . <p> Jen jumped up , " Why do n't you just ask me what happened ? " <p> " What happened ? " <p> " It 's too personal . I do n't want to go into it , " she smirked . John came busting out with a white paper bag full of sandwiches . <p> " Are we hanging in the garden tonight , or what ? " <p> " We found something there today . Let 's bring flashlights , " I said . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We had flashlights , and Jen had a faded canvas backpack over her shoulder . I led us to the low iron door of the bomb shelter . It all looked different at night , and the mouth of the tunnel leading down was like climbing into a sewer pipe . <p> " Wait a second , " John said . <p> " It only goes down ten feet , and there 's another door , " I explained . I could see the second door when I shined my light down . <p> " This is like a horror movie , " Jen said . <p> " There might be rats down there , " John said . <p> " Or snakes , " Jen said . <p> " Well , we could just .... " I said . <p> Jen put her flashlight in her teeth , and started down the iron rungs . <p> " See you in hell ! " <p> I followed , and John was right above me . <p> The bomb shelter was grimy and disappointing , with a couple of built in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I 'd rather get nuked than hang around here too long , " I said . <p> " Let 's play a game , " Jen said . She moved some crates around so there was a low table and places to sit . She pulled a candle stub out and lit it with her lighter . John looked at the door and the ladder up to the surface , clearly worried about our oxygen supply . <p> " You guys play Mexican ? " she asked , lining up dice , a bottle of Gordon 's vodka , and a shot glass . In the flickering light , with her long hair , she looked like she was about to perform a magic trick . " You do shots , right ? " <p> John and I had , in fact , played Mexican , which is sometimes called " Bullshit " or " Liar 's Dice . " You have to beat the roll of the guy who went before you , or at least say you did . Two sixes was the highest roll , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican " and then you could make someone drink . It was an OK game at a party , but I did n't see the point in playing it down here . <p> " Of course we do , " I said . <p> " Good . This kid I knew in Dover . He went with his family to Russia , and when he came back he had this great way to do shots , because the vodka tastes really bad over there , " she said . Jen took a water bottle out of her backpack and twisted off the lid . She took a shot , and held it in her mouth . Then she took a huge swig of water on top of it , and swallowed it all down . <p> " Try it , " she said . " All you taste is water . " <p> We played until the bottle was empty . John had sprawled on the moldy cot in the corner , and Jen was rolling the wax from the candles into little balls and throwing them at me . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , Kenny , " she said . John was breathing heavily through his nose , comatose , and I wondered about getting home . <p> I got off the crate , and made my way over to the damp , cinder block wall . I slumped against it , and Jen sat down next to me . She kissed me , her mouth soft , yet an unpleasant combination of cigarette smoke and the medicinal tang of vodka . Her hand was on my chest . <p> " What 's the matter ? " Jen asked . <p> " Nothing , " I said . <p> " I suppose this is about the kidnapping thing . I 'm damaged goods . " <p> " I do n't think that at all , " I said , " I do n't even think you were kidnapped . I think you ran away or something . " <p> " Like you 're the first person to figure that out , " she said . <p> I staggered up the ladder , into Mrs. Kensington 's garden . Coming out was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to touch bottom . It felt good to just suck air into my lungs , and lean against the gazebo . <p> Jen 's head appeared at the top of the ladder like a jack-in-the-box . " Kenny , come on . Will you at least listen to me ? " she asked . " I had my reasons , " she said , as I made my way to the garden wall and Arlington Street . I knew what she would say , that her mom went through her backpack and found pills , or that her dad took away her phone . I kept walking . <p> " Where are you going ? Home to breakfast ? " she shouted . <p> On top of the vodka , and old Friendly 's sandwiches , a bowl of cereal sounded pretty good , but she tried to make it sound like an insult . The streets were quiet and I drifted across town toward my house . I could pick out the sick trees , and the ones that needed pruning as I walked underneath them on the sidewalks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
