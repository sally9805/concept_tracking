The reservoir was low . Waiting in the bushes for Jack Noble 's car , I searched the water 's skin for the steeple of the church that lay drowned beneath . My father had explained how the village of Neversink had stood here until the late 1940s , when the Aver was dammed and the valley became a giant cup of water for thirsty New Yorkers a hundred miles south . He tried to convey his awe for this feat , but I was n't impressed . New York was downhill . How hard could it be ? <p> For me the magic lay in the name of the town . As a child , I had imagined God sending a flood to punish the boastful people who lived there . Sometimes I saw them swept up in a wave and tumbled about like clothes in a washer . At other times the water oozed from the ground ; the people kept on with their everyday lives , silent as fish If they ever repented their vanity and changed the name of their town , the flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I passed , maybe from habit , or maybe from a wish that forgiveness was possible , no matter the sin . <p> Jack 's big green Ford swerved from the road . I left my bike hidden under a hedge and emerged , picking twigs from my hair . As I spat on my hand and rubbed the scratch on my arm , I felt like a child , but with every step I aged . By the time I reached the car and slid in the front , legs drawn in last , I was graceful and poised . I eased my dress down my thighs , faced Jack , then smiled a tiny , wry smile . Where had I learned such gestures as these ? It was almost as if by reading Jack 's mind I was able to learn how a woman should behave . <p> " You came , " I said softly . <p> " What did you think , I 'd let a woman stand in the middle of nowhere and just not show up ? " <p> He had never been sarcastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd climbed into the car . Today he just sat there with the Ford 's big engine idling , his muscular arms slung over the steering wheel , hands dangling as though he had broken his wrists . <p> " It 's just that . . . I only . . . " The telepathy by which I sometimes was able to guess what to say had suddenly gone dead . Whenever this happened I tried to keep my mouth shut in the hope he would think me wise , enigmatic . <p> " Did you think I 'd forget.7 " he asked . " You 'd just slip my mnd ? " <p> How could I describe what it felt like to wait on a brilliant summer 's day for a man who was nearly three times my age , my teacher at school , handsome , experienced . " Do you know when you 're driving on a hot day like this and you see a mirage ? A pool of water on the road ? " <p> " Yeah ? " he said . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirsty . Very , very thirsty . And just when you get there , the water evaporates . " <p> " Thirsty ? " he said . " Is that how you feel ? " He stopped scowling . But still the car sat there for anyone to see  --  my parents , his wife , someone from school or Colonial Conn . <p> " The fact is , " he said , " I just stopped off to tell you that you 'd better not come . It 's not that I 'm . . . How could I be tired of you ? This has nothing to do with you . " <p> Why did n't it , I thought . So many things that mattered in his life had nothing to do with me . <p> " I 'm in a rotten mood , Dianne . Not many laughs today . " <p> Should I really get out ? I studied his face . He coached football at school and he had the stony features of a man used to hiding his strategy . With no clue from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd still like to come . " <p> He nodded as though this confirmed some fine truth he had suspected about me . This happened all the time , which was one thing I loved about being with Jack . <p> " All right , then , " he said . He put the car in drive and finally pulled out . " But do n't say I did n't warn you . This case we 're on today , it is n't going to be any picnic . " <p> Besides teaching history , Jack worked part time for a firm that insured camps and resorts across the Northeast . With his " pull , " as he called it , I had gotten a summer job at this company . Five days a week I sat by the switchboard with a pad of blank forms . Every few minutes the telephone rang , bringing reports of broken bones , cuts , and sometimes much worse . From Bar Harbor , Maine , to Cape May , New Jersey middle-aged men like too-heavy pears were dropping from trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange toadstools . When I looked out the window next to my desk , I was startled to see that anyone made it down Main Street unscathed . <p> Something about insurance intrigued me . But I did n't want to sit in that office and get as spooked as the women who worked there all year . To hear them talk , booby traps lay beneath every pine cone and rock . They spent their vacations weeding their yards and would just as soon allow their children to play with poison and knives as to send them to camp . <p> The men who went out to investigate the accidents scoffed at such fears . They always found someone or something to blame , and this made them cocky , like soldiers who wrote home from the front : Do n't worry , Mom , only the stupid fellows get killed . <p> So I jumped at Jack 's offer to take me " out in the field " on my Saturdays off . What a wonderful game  --  sniffing out risks , judging who was at fault . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zachary Blunt to order his wife up on the roof of Finkelstein 's Inn at three in the morning ? And did Harriet Schliesser of Flushing , New York , really see a hand reach in her shower and turn off the cold water , and , if she did , why would this villain want to scald a naked old woman in her nineties ? <p> " You 'll make a hell of an adjustor , " Jack told me . " I 'll teach you everything I know , and Eicher will have to give you the job . " <p> Mo Eicher , our boss , refused to let women out in the field . They were too soft , he said . They 'd feel sorry for the claimants and pay them too much . Like Mo , Jack considered women a species apart . But the code that Jack followed said that a man had to be fair . And it surely was n't fair that a " girl with my talents " should n't be allowed to be an adjustor . <p> " People tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first trip together . " But that 's a load of horseshit . The root of the word ' adjustor ' is ' just . ' Why is it wrong to go out , look around , get the truth down on paper and prove our insured is n't to blame before some shyster lawyer tries to palm off some lies ? Now , if someone gets hurt and it is n't his fault , the company pays . I give him a check . I even kick in a little something extra for his suffering and pain . " <p> This " little something extra " had gotten Jack in trouble with Mo . If a kid broke his leg , it was one thing to pay to have the leg set . But you could n't measure suffering , Mo scolded Jack , so what in the world would you write on the check ? <p> " He 's just being cheap , " Jack explained to me . " I mean , maybe I 'm off by a dollar or two , but I usually can guess what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money at all . What I give to most claimants does n't cost Mo a thing . " <p> I did n't like when Jack called Mo Eicher cheap . Mo and I were both Jews . But Mo did find it hard to part with a dime . The switchboard was old and its wires so frayed that it cut people off and I had to apologize . AndJack 's view of life , whether Catholic or not , had its appeal . Someone was liable for every mistake , and that someone paid . Whoever got hurt received compensation . <p> And so , on our trips , Jack catechized me in this doctrine of risk , cause and effect , suffering and pain . He had reached middle age and he feared he would die without having taught someone everything he knew . I was willing to learn . The autumn before , when I 'd been in his class , he had taken us to Gettysburg . We could barely keep up as he scrambled over fences and up and down hills describing how the soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blinded by smoke , as frightened and confused as we would have been , stumbling over friends who cried out for help . It was even more exciting to be alone with Jack , to hear him describe not a long-ago battle but the world I could see from his car as we drove . I did n't have a vision  --  things always seemed to go by in a blur  --  and Jack gave me his . The name of a town or a marker by the road , the sign for a camp where he had handled a case , would sat off a story about some evil person who wreaked terrible harm , and then , in a chain of cause and effect , brought his own demise . ( " Take Nixon , " he said as we listened to the hearings . " He 's like some old lady who 's too vain to wear sensible shoes . She falls on her ass , and she blames the hotel instead of the three-inch spikes on her heels . " ) <p> But today Jack was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we passed the sign that said WELCOME TO PENNSYLVANIA , he peered in both mirrors and blew out a sigh . <p> " If you want the report for today 's case , " he said , " it 's back there , in my bag . Tell me when you 're finished , " as though he would quiz me on what I had read . <p> I found his heavy briefcase between two smaller bookbags in green-and-blue plaid , the kind that kids carry at parochial school . His wife 's umbrella lay across the rear shelf . Just a few days before this I had seen Helen Noble struggling up the hill from the store to their house , clutching groceries to her chest and holding aloft this very umbrella , which showed cats and dogs tumbling through a cloudy pink sky . It had n't rained for weeks , and even when I realized that she must have been shielding her skin from the sun , her face was so grim and her hair so unkempt that she seemed half-insane . Not only was Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cracked ! I was relieved , as though this could absolve me from wishing her dead . <p> I leafed through Jack 's bag and pulled out a sheet labeled ACCIDENT REPORT Under each heading someone had noted the facts of the case in a big childish script ; even the f 's and l 's were so round that I expected to see a smiley face in each . <p> preDATE OF OCCURENCE : July 21 , 1973 , 4:05 p.m.LOCATION OF OCCURENCE : on the rifel range of Camp Fratrnity , inPocono , P.A.DESCRIPTION OF CLAIMANT : Sebastien Soole , mail , aged alven . . . It must have been Bunny who had taken the report . Not only would n't Bunny look up a word , if an accident bored her she made up details ( " Tatoo of Elvis on left butock , " she had written of an elderly man who had slipped in the tub ) . When I wrote reports , I thought of myself as a biblical scribe . I treated an outbreak of diarrhea caused by a spoiled batch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An old Jewish man who owned a hotel would say on the phone : " Just a minor haxident , a bruise and a cut . " And , with a flourish , I would inscribe on my pad : " The claimant fell and suffered hematomas , abrasions , contusions and lacerations to the right knee . " <p> I wished I could use a fountain pen , a quill , but that would n't have worked . Whatever I wrote had to echo itself on the sheet underneath , and the sheet under that , fainter each time , in lavender ink ( " ALL NEW MAGIC CARBON it said on the form ) . I would clip the original sheet to the file , then give the yellow copy to the adjustor who would handle the case . No one had told me what the third sheets were for . I stashed them in my desk , hoping to someday put them to use , compile the best accidents in a chronicle to rival Exodus or Job <p> I picked up the yellow sheet from my lap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on rifelry Claimant was laying on blanket on rifelry field , trying to hit targit . Claimant called over counslor and said his gun did n't work , it was stuck . Counslor picked up gun by handel Rifel went off , hitting claimant in groin regin . NATURE OF INJURIES Bullit entered public area , travling thru claimant 's penis and testies . . . <p> Jack punched the button for the lighter on the dash . " Eleven-year-old kid with his manhood shot off . And we 're totally liable ! Not much I can do except pick up the pieces . " <p> I pictured Jack on his knees on the " rifel range , " searching for the boy 's missing piece . If somebody found it , would the doctors be able to sew it back on ? If not , could they make Sebastien a new one , of rubber , with a winch to make it stand up ? The thought made me laugh . <p> I expected Jack to say , " Perhaps you can share the joke with the class , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its pack with his lips . The lighter popped out of the dashboard . When Jack touched it to his cigarette , it made a dry hiss . My parents did n't smoke , so whenever someone used the lighter in his car he seemed to possess some secret power that my family did n't have , as Jack had the power to feel this boy 's pain and I was left cold ( Not that this face showed what he felt . But inside , I could tell , Jack 's passions glowed like those hidden red coils . ) <p> Maybe if I 'd had a penis myself , I could have understood what it would mean to have it shot off . Had n't the girls , less squeamish for once , laughed at the boys who writhed in their seats when the rabbi described the way Abraham had sealed his covenant with God ? Then again , as Mo said , girls were supposed to be softer than boys . Never mind a penis , what I lacked was some organ of sympathy that other girls had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lighter in my parents ' Pontiac , it had never been used . If I wanted to be an adjustor like Jack , I would have to learn to measure suffering and pain . <p> I gave it a try . I envisioned a boy who stood weeping in the showers as his classmates pranced around him , naked as imps , and tried to snatch the towel he clutched to his waist . <p> The only emotions this scene made me feel were a mild titillation and an urge to snatch away that towel myself . Ashamed , I tried harder . He was older , a man now , staring out a window at a woman , at me . His nails scraped the glass . He would never make love ( this gave me a pang , but for my loss , not his ) . He would never have children . How did that feel ? I was tired of hearing thirdhand reports . Who was this boy with his manhood shot off ? I had to find out . Would I ever get to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to remain objective , as Mo seemed to think , or sympathetic , like Jack ? <p> " I 'll tell you , " Jack said , his thumb and index finger rubbing his eyes against the sun 's glare , or maybe the smoke from his cigarette , " when that mother 's phone rang , and she picked it up and heard , ' I 'm calling from camp . It 's your son . He 's been shot , ' you know what she felt ? Here 's what she felt . She was standing on a railroad track and she saw a train coming . It was moving so slow that she was n't afraid . She 'd step out of the way long before it got to her . But she could n't move her legs . And then the train hit . " <p> It was hopeless , I thought . I could never compete with Jack Not only could he feel the boy 's suffering , he felt the parents ' as well ; he had three sons himself , twins a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade . ( He also had three daughters . In what organ did their " womanhood " abide ? ) <p> He leaned so far back that he seemed to be driving with his eyes on the roof . " I warned you I 'd be lousy company today . " <p> If only I could cross the distance between us on that hot plastic seat . . But how could I comfort someone like Jack ? He gave and I took . All I could offer was my blankness , my youth . <p> We turned off the highway at the exit for the Poconos . I held my arm out the window . The maple trees came right to the road ; their leaves slapped my palm . An insect smacked my wrist and fell like a stone . I took a deep breath : melting tar , dry grass , hot vinyl , smoke , the detergent Helen used to launder Jack 's shirt . on Saturdays , with Jack , each sight , sound , and smell seemed like a letter in a language that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette in the tray beneath the radio . I had to avert my eyes from his hands . Not a boy 's hands , as smooth as a bar of wet soap . Rough , callused hands . If they touched you , they would leave a mark on your skin . I imagined how they 'd feel on my neck , on my breasts . I was almost content with all Jack had taught me about insurance and history , but I hoped he would someday throw in a lesson on how to make love . <p> " Hold on to your horses ! " He laughed like a man who knows that he 's been gloomy too long . The car dove in a creek and plowed through the water . " It 's been five years , at least , since that bridge washed away . I keep telling the people who own the camp that they ought to put up a new one . Engine gets wet and Colonial Conn has to pay for a car . " <p> They had n't even bothered to fix the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spelled the camp 's name were broken or missing ; the ones that remained formed a pattern as mysterious as runes on a stone . <p> We parked on a patch of dirt ringed by logs and walked through the camp . " okay , then , " Jack said , " tell me what you see , " a game he had invented called " Spotting the Risk . " <p> What did I see ? A cluster of tens made of dirty torn canvas . A wooden pole with no flag . We seemed to have stumbled on the encampment of some defeated army . Most of the soldiers already had fled . Half-deflated kickballs , broken bows , and bats lay strewn on the ground . A boy dragged a duffel bag out of his tent ; from the way he hung his head and tugged at the cord , it seemed to contain all the bad dreams he and his tentmates had dreamed for a month . Another boy was throwing darts at a bird . <p> " Should n't someone be watching the kids who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " People wonder why accidents happen in twos and threes , but now you see why . When one kid gets hurt they forget about the rest . " <p> He led me to a cabin a little way off from the main part of camp . Its mottled walls blended so well with the leaves it could barely be seen . Inside , it was furnished with a cot and two chairs . An elderly couple sat on the chairs , so desperately sad they gave the room the feel of a cell on death row . Even in July they huddled inside misshapen sweaters that hung to their knees . The sweaters had frayed , and the old people seemed to have unraveled as well . <p> " Adelaide . Paul . " I waited for Jack to reproach our insureds . Their neglect was so clear ! Instead , he patted the hump on the old woman 's back . " Do n't worry , " he told her . " You wo n't lose the place . We 'll pay the boy 's bills . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " <p> " Who cares for the court . " She had some sort of accent , maybe German , or French . " It is better they should lock us away . It is better they should line us up on the wall and shoot with the gun . " <p> " The whole life , " Paul moaned . " To think the whole life should come to this end . " <p> " Now Addy . Now Paul . " He cradled Paul 's hands in one of his own . " That is n't God 's way . It 's not like a race , where only the end matters . He knows what you 've been through . He 'll weigh the good with the bad . " <p> Paul moaned again , then pressed his face to Jack 's knuckles and cried . <p> I turned away , as though the old people 's torment were an unpleasant smell . Lining the walls were every sort of artifact a camper could make from shells , macaroni , clay , acorns , leaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely they had left a thin layer of loam on the shelf . I lifted an ashtray modeled in the shape of a small hand . To ADDY AND PAUL LOVE PATTI ' 49 was inscribed on the bottom . <p> " It is our fault , our fault . " Addy yanked at her tufts of gray hair . " Put that on your paper ! " <p> Jack was trying to take a statement from Paul . " All the court will want to know is whether you saw the accident or not , how you found out , what you did then . Just keep to the fact  --  when you bought the rifles , when they were last cleaned and repaired . Save the guilt part for me . " <p> Paul bowed his head and murmured an answer to whatever Jack asked . Then his wife did the same . Jack slid their statements into his briefcase as tenderly as though he were handling their wills . When we left they were calm , hands on their laps and chins on their chests . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , pointing out some phrase that was n't quite a lie but would help our attorneys defend our insureds . As we walked across the camp we no longer bothered playing our game . What was the point ? The risks were as obvious as the shiny red ivy leaves choking our path . <p> The rifle range was just a bumpy field in which big paper bull's-eyes kept watch over a row of moth-eaten blankets . While Jack took some photos to document that nothing about the range was amiss  --  the problem was that it existed at all  --  I knelt by a square of flattened grass and searched for spatters of blood , hoping these would remind me that Sebastien Soole was the one who had been hurt , not Addy or Paul . They were old and pathetic , but how did that excuse them from ruining a life ? I would have asked Jack , but I did n't see him anywhere , and this made me nervous . <p> I found him at last outside the latrines . The stench there was foul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out he was shaking his head . <p> " What 's the matter ? " I asked . " Do n't tell me you found another risk in there . " <p> He worked the handle of a pump , cupped water in his palms and buried his face . <p> " Did n't you hear what I said , Jack ? " okay , he had warned me not to come on this trip , but I could n't have imagined he would be so distraught over someone else 's troubles . Not for so long <p> He wiped his face on his shirttail , then tucked it back in . He seemed surprised I was there . " oh , " he said , " it 's nothing . It 's just I was thinking . . . Years ago , in its time , this camp was n't bad . They had a way with kids . But then they got old . They could n't keep it up . And a rifle range ! In this day and age of liability ! If I told them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . But after all they 'd been through , over there , in Europe . . . Addy thought that children ought to be able to defend themselves , in case it happened again . " <p> He was trying to confuse me . If this had been a trial , the judge would have ruled this story inadmissible . Like any good juror I should stop up any ears . " Should n't we talk to the counselor ? They said he would be leaving pretty soon . " <p> Jack looked at me and nodded . " You 're right , " he said . " We 'd better . " <p> We found him in his tent , slouched on his cot . He was already packed , except for some photos . He was only a year or two older than I was , with pale yellow hair and a face round and blank as the top of a corn muffin . He told Jack what had happened in an agitated way , confessing as quickly and completely as possible to show he was innocent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 'm really just in charge of nature , " he said . He only had agreed to supervise the range as a favor to his bunkmate . " I shot a boy . I shot him ! " He pounded the mattress . Little flakes of rust snowed to the floor . " I wanted to do something worthwhile with my life , but with this in my files . . . " <p> What files did he mean ? Did this muffin-faced boy think God would keep a file on a life such as his ? If He did keep such files , I hoped that He kept them in real metal drawers instead of old shoeboxes such as Mo brought to the office ; I imagined the boxes in heaven collapsing , as ours often did , and folders raining down , everyone scrambling to find his or her file and read what God had written there over the years . <p> By now the boy was crying . " I mean , never mind I shot him , what kind of person would stand there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up a photo . I could see a family posed by a barbecue pit . " You know what my mother told me before I came up here ? She said , ' Scottie , you 're my life . You 're the reason I 've lived . Be careful , because if anything were to happen to you , I do n't know what I would do . ' " <p> He flung himself facedown on his cot , crushing the photos . He was begging for comfort , as obvious as a five-year-old child . <p> Jack sat on the cot , which squeaked beneath his weight . " Listen , " he said , " did you do it on purpose ? " <p> " On purpose ? " The counselor twisted his head . " of course I did n't ! " <p> " So what caused it ? " <p> " What caused what ? " <p> " You did a favor for a friend , right ? This friend of yours should n't have left you in charge of those guns . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else ? " Jack asked . " You were standing there , right , and the kid called you over ? Why 'd he call you over ? " <p> " He said his gun was stuck . " <p> " Well , was it ? " <p> " I do n't think so . He was kind of , well , clumsy . on this nature hike we took , he tried to carve a slingshot like this other kid had . He could n't get it to work . He threw down the knife and it sliced his shin . I was like that once . I hated to watch how unhappy he 'd make himself . I thought , with this gun , I could fix it before he got frustrated , hurt himself . " <p> " So the accident happened because you did a friend a favor . And you felt sorry for the kid . " <p> " I was careless ! " he said . " What kind of jerk picks up a gun by the handle ! " <p> " All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did a terrible thing . Did you think you were going to lead a perfect life ? What are you going to do now , kill yourself because you 've made a big mistake ? Is that going to help the world ? Will that help your mother , if you waste the rest of your life because you made one bad mistake ? You 're the reason she 's lived . You want to waste her life ? " <p> The kid wiped his nose . He sighed and took a breath . " You 're right , " he said . " I know . I just had to hear someone tell me the truth . " <p> Jack pulled out his pad . " okay , then , " he said , " tell me what happened  --  what you did , what you saw . " <p> Did he really believe what he had said to this boy ? or was he just trying to keep the boy 's guilt from leaking all over the statement , which was meant to help our insureds ? What gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the one who had been hurt . <p> The counselor stood from the cot . He was taller than Jack who was over six feet . " Thank you , " he said , pumping Jack 's hand . He held it so long I thought he would kiss the fingers , as Paul had . It was his fault I thought . But then , Jack had n't said it was n't . <p> On our way to the car we stopped to see the nurse . She was Jack 's age . Her skin was very dark and she had dyed her hair red . In her stretchy white uniform she was shaped like a backwards S. She stood before a cabinet sorting through a jumble of Band-Aids and gauze , tongue depressors , gum , and Tootsie Roll Pops . Jack sat on a trunk , his ankle on his knee , and took down what she said . He did n't need to first absolve her of guilt .

It was my fault . ' No , my fault . ' And there I am , on my knees , shouting for an ambulance and trying my best to keep that poor boy from bleeding to death . " <p> Jack said , " Maureen , you do n't think they 'd do it , Addy and Paul ? " <p> She locked up the cabinet . " Nah . They 're too dead to kill themselves . ' Cept they do n't eat .

" She laughed . " Girl whatever you 're assisting this man with , watch out . " <p> Before this , I had wanted people to assume I was sleeping with Jack <p> even though I was n't . But now I was n't sure . I could n't meet her eyes . <p> " Ooh , girl , I can see it . You 're gon na get your heart broke . Better take one of these . " She waved the Band-Aid in my face .

He fiddled with his pen . He uncrossed his legs , then crossed them again the opposite way . How could she have said such things in his presence ! I wanted to run . <p> " Come here , girl , " she said . She took a step closer . " Maureen was just kidding . " She put her arms around me . She smelled of clean nylon , iodine , and salves . If Jack had n't been there , I would have tried to stay in her arms for a month .

We did n't see a doctor , only a nun in a habit so gray that she almost was invisible against the gray walls . <p> " Should we be here ? " I asked . <p> Jack took this to be a question of ethics . " I 'm not fooling myself that ' we 'll settle the case . But if we can talk to the parents , maybe they wo n't think we 're such ogres .

The boy looked like one himself , delicate but gawky , a plane that would n't glide . He was so very young ! It struck me that he probably did n't understand any better than I did what a wound like his meant . <p> Jack knocked on the door frame . The woman dropped her needles . <p> " I 'm Jack Noble , " he said . " I know this is hard . I wo n't stay too long . " <p> " Who are you , the priest or something ? " asked the father . " You the chaplain at this lousy excuse for a hospital ? " <p> Jack seemed to regret that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonial Connecticut . We insure the camp . I just want- " <p> The man jumped from his chair . Still holding his sandwich , he danced around the room , trampling planes underfoot . " I know what you want ! How dare you come here ! You ambulance chaser , you ! " <p> The boy cringed . He pulled his sheet to his eyes . " Dad ! " he said . " oh , Dad . " <p> Jack moved toward the boy . He held out his hand . <p> The man slapped it away  --  not in jest , like Maureen , but as hard as he could . " Get out of here ! Do n't go near my boy ! You want us to sign something that says it was all Sebby 's fault ! You think I 'm an idiot ? You think I have n't already gotten the best lawyer I could afford ? Maybe those two senile old wrecks ca n't make good what we lost , but I sure as hell can get some money from your company ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his words worse than a shout . " You did n't lose anything . You know how lucky you are ? All right , it 's pretty bad for your kid . I admit that , I 'm sorry . But I 'd trade in a minute . In a minute , you hear ? Take your lawsuit and lawyer- " Jack 's fist flew up , but he turned and stalked away before it could strike . <p> By the time I reached the car , Jack was already gunning the gas . I scrambled in beside him . He sped past the stop sign and took the next curve in the oncoming lane . By then , the world seemed so full of dangers that it was almost a relief to know how I would die , in a crash in Jack 's Ford . We were nowhere near anything . He was arguing with someone , moving his lips , and I could n't interrupt to ask why he had been so kind to the people to blame for the shooting and so harsh with the father of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said finally . He lit his cigarette , shook the lighter as though to put out a match , then threw the lighter out the window . It hit the pavement and bounced . He saw what he had done , slammed on the brakes , flung the door open and began kicking through the grass . <p> I got out to help and found it in a minute . I gave it to Jack . He slumped on a rock and rolled the dented lighter between his palms . <p> " It does n't matter if Mo fires me , " he said . " I could n't let it go . ' What we lost ' ! The jerk ! He sent away his son . I 'll bet he did n't even check out the place first . He picked it from a magazine . And he is goddamn lucky . All right , so the kid lost his prick and his balls .. He can have operations . He wo n't die from losing his prick and his balls . " <p> That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had gone for his physical to play football that fall for the junior varsity team . What are all those bruises ? the doctor had asked . ( Contusions , I thought . ) Are you tired a lot ? <p> Oh yeah , but it 's nothing , Hugh told the man . It 's just I 've been running some plays with my brothers . They hit pretty hard for little kids . And I 'm not in great shape , so I ca n't catch my breath . <p> But the doctor was suspicious . He ordered some blood tests , and , as it turned out , Hugh was pretty far gone . <p> Earlier that summer , I had overheard Jack tell another adjustor how much he looked forward to coaching his son in another year or two ? when he made the varsity team . Hugh was a born wingback , he said . How magical that had sounded ? as though Hugh had the power to lift himself over the other boys ' heads . Now , as Jack spoke , I imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass . He could n't lift his arms and the ball smacked his chest . A magnificent bruise bloomed on his skin . <p> " It does n't make sense , " Jack said to me now , crouching on that rock . " Why would God punish Hugh for my sits ? " ? ' <p> Something was wrong with his logic , I was sure . But I had come to regard him as an expert in matters of cause and effect , so I let him go on . <p> " The others did n't count . They were n't whores exactly , but they knew whet they were doing . And I did it for Helen . She sure did n't need any more kids . But a girl like you . . . How can I fool myself ? You 're for my sake , not hers . " <p> Was he saying it was my fault that his son had leukemia ? " But you never even kissed me ! 7 ' <p> " In my mind . . . In my thoughts . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt . He had n't just asked me along for the ride . What had we done in his mind ? Was it sinful enough to cause his vents death ? It was frightening that our thoughts , let alone our actions , could matter so much . But it would have been even more frightening if they had n't mattered at all , if death could strike anyone . That I could inflict suffering on such a grand scale made me godlike myself . <p> " Maybe I should go . I can find a way home . I can hitch. or find a bus . . . " <p> " I told you before , this has nothing to do with you . I 'll take you home , of course . But not right away . Helen 's there , in the kitchen . It 's her fault , she says , cancer runs in her family . And she should have noticed sooner , about the bruises . I ca n't face that right now . And Hugh . And the other kids . . . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any rate . " He stood from the rock . He wobbled a bit . " I need to dear my head . I 'll go for a walk . Then I 'll be fine . I 'll drive you home . " He climbed a broken wire fence and walked across the pasture . <p> A sheet of inky clouds , thin as a blotter , covered the field In the heat the crickets sang like tropical birds straining toward speech . And I finally understood this language of the senses , the meaning of these sights , odors and sounds . They meant that I was alive to see , smell and hear them . After Hugh died , he would n't see or feel . <p> I came upon Jack lying facedown in the grass , his head on his arms . <p> " Oh God , oh Christ . " <p> He was asking for pity . He was glad I was there , watching this show . <p> " If thy right hand offend thee , cut it off .... " His voice was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For it is profitable that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell . " <p> Had n't Jack told me that if you had faith , you would receive compensation for your suffering and pain ? According to Jack , God had sent Christ out in the field to learn to adjust the claims of the soul . Well , it did n't seem to work . I wanted Jesus Christ to appear in this field and make Jack feel better , as Jack himself had done for Addy and Paul and the counselor who had shot Sebastien . <p> " It 's my fault . My fault . " <p> So what if it was ? Should he cut off his hand ' ( or his manhood , I thought . ) Even if Jack had caused his own grief , did that give me the right to walk away and leave him ' <p> I knelt by his side . I smoothed his ruffled hair , ran my hand along his shoulders , then down his spine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed my face to his neck . And , as I did so , I could feel what he was feeling , hear what he was thinking : A few months from now , my son will be rotting in a box in the ground . My sins caused his death . And some Horror much worse that I could n't put in words . <p> I had never known anything like it before . Had I had this capacity all the time and not used it ? or had it come now , in a moment of grace ? <p> I felt Helen 's grief , too , as though love were the ink on a sheet of Magic Carbon , transmitting copy after copy , weak but still faithful , of other people 's pain . She sat in her kitchen , her son very sick and her husband out somewhere , maybe at work , or maybe with a whore , or with one of his students . She trudged up that hill with food for her children and soap for Jack 's shirts , braving a storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment that I felt Helen 's pain , I also understood that I had to ease Jack 's . <p> The grass that we lay on was dry from the drought , but comfort seemed to flow from my hands like a stream that seeped up from somewhere deep underground . <p> All through that summer I comforted Jack . After Hugh died , Helen would n't leave her room . What I did was n't right . But I like to think that Jack was able to hold his family together because I consoled him . <p> On the ride home that evening I sat very close to Jack . I did n't want to let him think his own thoughts , but I dropped off to sleep . I awoke with his arm draped around my shoulders , my head on his neck . <p> " Thanks for coming , " he said . " I 'm glad you decided to come . " <p> He looked at me the way he did when I asked a question in class , shaking his head because even though he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He ran a knuckle down my cheek . Then he kissed me goodbye . And he kissed me again , with gratitude , and love , and finally with desire , which also gripped me . <p> " See you Monday , " he said . He leaned across my lap and opened my door . <p> I watched as his taillights traced a red line over the dam , then I pushed through the hedge to look for my bike . There was no moon that night , and I could n't even catch a glint from the frame I started to panic , until my legs brushed the handlebars . <p> I pedaled towards home , rehearsing the excuse I would make to my parents . The road across the spillway was so narrow and dark that I stopped in the middle , straddling my bike . <p> The dam had to have a valve . What if I turned it ? The steeple of the church would reappear first , then the roofs of the houses . The people of Neversink , repentant or not , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make up for the long years they had missed . <p> I worked my way through college as an adjustor for a much larger company than Colonial Conn . The boss would n't allow any adjustor , female or male , to offer claimants money for their suffering and pain , but , Jack had told me , what most of them wanted had little to do with the figure on a check . <p> After graduation , I got a job teaching history in a town outside Reading . Every fall I took my class on a trip to the battlefield at Gettysburg , as Jack had once done . I knew he lived in Pittsburgh , and I knew he loved the park , so I was n't surprised when I saw him there finally . The place , after all , is a monument to ghosts . <p> What surprised me about seeing Jack in the lot as we filed off the bus was how guilty I felt . I had to remind myself that I had n't killed Hugh . I had hurt Helen , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm doing well , he said . The family is fine <p> " This is Jack Noble , " I said to my class . " He was my teacher , " I told them , as though being links in a chain would make them more important than they were in themselves . <p> They must have guessed that Jack had been more than my teacher . Kids always can sense something like that . I still thought him handsome , though gaunt and detached . His hands no longer seemed large enough to spread across the shoulders of a big high-school lineman . <p> He had given up teaching sixteen years earlier . He looked at my class so wistfully that , on an impulse , I asked him to lead our tour of the park . <p> At first he seemed wary . Then he roused himself and said that he would be glad to . He gained more and more vigor as he strode around the park , describing this or that skirmish or flanking maneuver . <p> He tried to make certain that my students understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Those who can not remember the past are <p> condemned to repeat it , " he said , as every history teacher does . <p> He had taught this same lesson when I had been here the first time . Because I had roved Jack even then , I had believed him . <p> But now I was n't sure . Was it really so vital to know whom to blame for the thousands who died ? It 's the virtue of the human mind that it tries to judge who 's at fault . But it 's the virtue of the heart that it sometimes forgets . <p> After the battle , Jack told my class , thousands of wounded Confederate soldiers were left to the mercy of the people of Gettysburg What if I 'd been a farm wife , I wondered , with all those wounded Rebels moaning for water not far from my house ? They had brought it on themselves , fighting for a cause that could n't be more wrong . They had killed other men . <p> But as Jack went on talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself kneeling next to some dying soldier , his face sometimes Hugh 's , sometimes the face of a boy in my class . He strained to sit up , as my own son strains forward when he is eager to nurse , and I leaned down to offer what comfort I could . <p> <p> By Eileen Pollack <p>
