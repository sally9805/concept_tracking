Section : NATIONAL AFFAIRS <p> Politics : Until now , there seemed to be a consensus to finally balance Washington 's books . But as they wrangle over shutdowns and spending , will the ego-driven Clinton and Gingrich wreck a historic opportunity ? <p> The house democrats had a problem last Thursday morning . They wanted to mock Speaker Newt Gingrich for his infantile outbursts by bringing giant baby bottles to wave on the House floor , but the local Price Club store that sold the props did n't open until 11 a.m . Never mind that the federal government was also closed , and that most Americans were blaming both parties for the mess . There were important matters to debate in the people 's chamber . Such as : was it permissible , under the rules of the House , to display a blown-up image of that morning 's New York Daily News with the front-page headline " CRY BABY " ? The parliamentary question was put to a vote , and Republicans protected their speaker 's honor , 231 to 173 . The tabloid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such was the drama last week in the theater of the absurd also known as the Congress . For many Americans , the government shutdown was not a calamity , unless they were trying to vacation at the Grand Canyon or wanted to get a passport . Most essential services , from air-traffic control to mailing social-security checks , went on as usual , and it seemed likely that some kind of stopgap legislation would restore the rest before Thanksgiving . At the weekend , White House and Hill negotiators worked to resolve the impasse and overcome hard-line House Republicans who were shouting " Shut it down ! " with a passion not unlike that of the antiwar protesters of an earlier era . <p> Yet the real showdown is still to come . The squabbling over short-term funding was a skirmish before the larger struggle over reducing the $200 billion-a-year federal deficit . This week the Republicans will send the president a bill balancing the budget by 2002 . Clinton vows to veto it , accusing the GOP of heartlessness toward the elderly , the poor and the environment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the way to balance  --  or it may become another depressing chapter in the capital 's march of folly . The outcome hangs largely on whether the two garrulous baby boomers who occupy the Oval Office and the speaker 's chair can overcome their self-infatuation  --  and , in effect , grow up . <p> Since last spring , it had appeared almost certain that Congress would take the first meaningful step in decades toward controlling government spending . The GOP majority elected in 1994 had defied conventional wisdom , which held that modern politicians were incapable of cutting popular programs like Medicare , student loans or farm subsidies . The realization seemed to have finally sunk in that Washington can not keep on spending more than it takes in ; even Bill Clinton had signed on to the goal of a balanced budget . The capital appeared poised for a rare moment of political transcendence , in which lawmakers risc above their fear of losing the next election . <p> Then human nature reasserted itself . Clinton and Gingrich began worrying about their own large personal egos , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal responsibility . There is still hope the speaker and the president will see the costs of failure : higher interest rates slowing the economy , an ever-greater debt for future generations and deeper public cynicism . At the same time , there remains the real risk that vanity and pique will wreck a historic opportunity . <p> Much depends on the protagonists ' fraught relationship . Clinton and Gingrich regard each other with a mixture of envy , empathy and contempt . Like the two brightest kids in class , they " try to out-wonk each other , " says a senior administration aide . " It 's ' I 'm smarter than you , nah , nah , nah ' . " Still , they appeared to have warily bonded over the past year , talking often on the phone about their shared hatred of the press and the need to protect their political flanks . Through the summer , Gingrich believed that Clinton was trying to distance himself from traditional liberals , and Clinton believed that Gingrich was trying to moderate the deeply conservative House COP freshmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> This fragile good will began to collapse two weeks ago , at precisely the wrong moment . Just as Clinton was opening negotiations , his poll numbers started creeping up . He seemed to be scoring by bashing the COP for cutting health benefits for the elderly . After wobbling through most of the year , the president suddenly decided to demonstrate his convictions . <p> This was the Clinton on display one night last week as he greeted congressional Republicans behind closed doors at the White House . Halfway through the hour long session , House Majority Leader Dick Armey complained that the president was trying to frighten the congressman 's grandmother by demagoguing the impact of Medicaid cuts on nursing-home care . " Why would anybody say that we 're trying to wreck Medicaid ? " said Armey . " That 's just ridiculous . " <p> Clinton was " simmering , " a participant in the meetings told NEWSWEEK . " How do you think I felt when all I heard from you was how our 1998 deficit-reduction plan was going to wreck the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign the GOP 's budget  --  " Not now , not ever . " Armey replied that he was " unimpressed " with everything the president had just said . Then he chided White House chief of staff Leon Panetta for calling GOP lawmakers " terrorists . " At that point , Clinton rose and pointed his finger at the Republicans across the table . " I do n't care what you said about me . But I have never said anything disparaging about your wife or any other family member . " ( Armey had called Hillary Clinton a Marxist in a 1998 speech . ) The room fell silent ; the meeting went nowhere . <p> On Wednesday it was Gingrich 's turn to overreact . At a breakfast with reporters , he warmed up by calling the president " morally bankrupt . " Then he began a strange whine about how he had been treated poorly aboard Air Force One on the flight to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin 's funeral in Israel . He claimed that Clinton had ignored him and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two COP lawmakers disembark at the back of the plane . The speaker said the slights provoked him to take a harder line during the negotiations . <p> Gingrich 's petulance thrilled the White House . They released a photo of Gingrich and Dole chatting with a respectfully deferential president on Air Force One . In fact , Clinton had refused to talk to the Republican leaders about the budget . He was too worn out by the emotional funeral to dicker with Gingrich on the ride home . For the president , the public-relations point was won . Even Republicans were shaking their heads . Gingrich " needs to go home and take a nap , " said Republican Rep. Dave Weldon of Florida . <p> Gingrich was a victim of his own hubris , say his intimates . Like Louis XIV ( " L'etat , c'est moi " ) , he thinks of himself as the embodiment of the new Republicanism . " I am the right wing , " he once pronounced . He has transformed the formerly open speaker 's office in the Capitol into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force One he was made to feel like a mere backbencher again , shown to the rear . <p> Gingrich 's vision and bluster were essential to launching the GDP revolution , but it may take different skills to turn it into law . Last week Dole pointedly appealed to both sides to act " like reasonable adults . " He remarked to NEWSWEEK that while Gingrich and Clinton were " up in the spotlight , " he was " somewhere in the shadows . It 's not a bad place to be , " he said  --  with a wintry smile . <p> Dole knows there are a number of ways out of the current impasse . A compromise to reopen the Washington Monument is only a temporary reprieve . The worst solution to the larger budget contest would be to punt-to enact a yearlong " continuing resolution " and in effect turn the budget into a referendum in the 1996 election . All sides realize , however , that the public would view that as a failure of government , and the only obvious winner would be Ross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 96 campaign that , post-Powell , already seems so arid . The White House and Hill could compromise by trimming the scope of the cuts and adopting more optimistic economic assumptions , which is what the White House wants . But that would be a return to the old smoke-and-mirrors approach to spending . The most sensible solution would be to scale back-if not eliminate-the GOP 's $245 billion tax cut . Both Clinton and the Republicans have promised at least a $500-a-year tax break to middle-class families . To get lawmakers to renounce such a goody on the eve of an election would require real leadership . Last week it was not to be found at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue . And no matter what kind of short-term fix the White House and the Hill apply , they will still be a long way away from making the truly essential compromises . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Far apart : After Gingrich claimed Clinton snubbed him on Air Force One , the White House released this damning photo  --  and even Republicans decided the petulant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Theater of the absurd : While Gingrich and Clinton angrily blustered , Dole was left to suggest that they act ' like reasonable adults ' Lurching Toward a Balanced Budget <p> The real fight  --  over the size of government and the deficit  --  is just beginning . According to the Congressional Budget Office , the GOP cuts deeply and hits a surplus by 2002 ; the Democrats do n't .

NUMBERS DO N'T ADD BECAUSE OF ROUNDING <p> BY BILL TURQUE AND EVAN THOMAS With THOMAS ROSENSTIEL and BOB COHN <p> WHAT 'S REALLY AT STAKE <p> How to make sense of the chaos in the capital <p> Between Partisan Rhetoric and Economic jargon , it 's hard to tell what the fight is truly about . No matter how the two sides settle the government shutdown . Congress and President Clinton will continue t clash over long-term spending . Rich Thomas , Newsweek 's chief economics correspondent , translates : Why did it come to this ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For starters , Republicans moved slowly all year . By Oct. 1 , Congress was supposed to have approved 18 appropriations bills : it had only passed two . It was also a month and a half late in passing its seven-year budget plan covering taxes and entitlements like Medicare . Clinton stalled , too , then offered only a sketchy plan to hit balance in 10 years . Are they fighting over the whole budget or just some temporary measure ? <p> Both . The shutdown happened because the government fiscal year had ended and Congress had n't yet approved spending plans for next year . In the past , Congress has passed a continuing resolution to pay the bills for a few weeks until the real budget is worked out . But Congress and Clinton could n't agree on even that because each saw the vote as a preview of the battle over the big seven-year plan . Is Clinton right that COP Medicare cuts would devastate the program ? <p> No . The Republicans would raise insurance premiums a little and slow Medicare growth from 12 percent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicare growth almost as much ( to 7.5 percent ) and increase premiums almost as much ( only $58 less per year in 2002 ) . Under either plan some services would suffer , but for the most part , hospitals would become more efficient and doctors would have to settle for smaller salary increases . To reduce the deficit , Congress must restrain Medicare . Is Gingrich right that Congress is merely trying to save Medicare ? <p> Half right . Medicare inflation must be curbed to preserve the program , but Republicans would n't have to change as much if they were n't also slashing taxes . And much of the GOP 's $245 billion tax cut does go to the affluent . What are the big differences between the Democrats and the Republicans ? <p> The Republicans would cut three times as much as the Democrats from Medicaid , which subsidizes nursing homes for many Americans and health care for the poor . They would reduce spending for scores of programs like student loans and environmental protection . Clinton would increase such spending slightly . And Republicans want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do Republicans and Democrats treat the poor the same ? <p> No . While Clinton endorses some radical changes in one welfare program ( Aid to Families with Dependent Children ) he leaves the rest of the " safety net " intact . Republicans trim across the board . What kind of tax cuts will there be ? <p> Probably a $400 to $500 tax credit per child for families making up to about $90,000 a year . A cut in the capital-gains tax is likely , too . That 's about all . Does it matter what " economic assumptions " are used ? <p> Absolutely . The Congressional Budget Office conservatively assumes that the economy will grow 2.3 percent a year from 1995 through 2002 . Clinton 's budgeteers " tweaked " their forecast up to 2.5 percent . If the economy grows faster , so does personal income , profits and , ultimately , tax collections . By assuming a more robust economy , Clinton 's forecasters " gained " $475 billion in extra revenues , enabling Clinton  --  on paper  --  to balance the budget without painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan produces a $200 billion deficit . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Shutdown strategy : Turning tourists away <p>
