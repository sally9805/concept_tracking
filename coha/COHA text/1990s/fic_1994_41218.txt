Now it happened in the twelfth month that James and Crowbar visited Renah , James 's sister . They were there to never lift a hand . Just their fork expecting something on it . <p> The two men drove from Nail , Arkansas , along Highway 16 to Red Star , where Renah had her cabin nearly built into the hills . Her goats and a few hens . A woodpile . Some rusted auto parts Crowbar was thinking of getting for his salvage yard he called Trucks and Stuff : <p> If he could find them under the snow . <p> And Renah rising early to cook , cooked until after sundown thinking already what to have the next day . Asking for nothing but a trip to the cemetery with a Christmas basket for the parents ' graves . If her brother , James , and his friend , Crowbar , had made it across Highway 16 from Nail , they could give her a lift to the graveyard . <p> What were they doing here , anyway ? Expecting their Christmas fruitcake and curls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the kitchen table . James stirred his coffee with fury and chopped the eggs on his plate . <p> Renah cleared her hands . <p> We open the morning with prayer . <p> Even before their first bite was swallowed . <p> EEEEEeeeee . Renah jumped on the curled edge of the linoleum floor when the Spirit moved her . She skitted across the floor in a holy ghost dance . Tames and Crowbar just looking at her with their mouthful of eggs and toast . Even when she prayed quietly , you could hear James chewing . He might choke , you know , with a mouthful of breakfast . He had to get it down . Crowbar nudged him . But James kept chewing . <p> You ca n't hear what she says when you chew , James told him . <p> It was true . Crowbar tried it . <p> But Renah kept moving in the Spirit . <p> And sure enough , soon you could see the drizzling stars dry up . And soon you could see the morning coming from a long way off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acorns . The morning sun round as an egg basket . <p> But soon James and Crowbar went back to eating . The truth of the matter was , the ceiling in Arkansas was too high for them . Somewhere up near under heaven , Renah said . They lost interest before they saw too far . <p> The men lived according to their own ways which were somewhat limited and shortsighted . But they could see the blue sweep of sky across the window . <p> James , Renah said when she 'd prayed . <p> Whad ? <p> I 'd like to take a Christmas basket to the graves . <p> Id snowed , he said . <p> I want to go anyway . <p> Go f ' ' t , James said . <p> Renah hummed as she boiled rinse water for the dishes . <p> James had hoped Crowbar would be a brother-in-law . Renah was not an unhandsome woman , but how could he hand her to Crowbar , Bible-brained as she was ! She had black curls kept tight to her head . White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the strains of back-hill Cherokee . Whose mouth even turned up with the curve of a squirrel tail . <p> Crowbar owned his business , Trucks and Stuff on the edge of Nail , Arkansas . <p> He had , after inventory , <p> two pickups or what was left of them a backhoe <p> a twenty-year-old bus used by a preacher friend of Renah 's <p> a Kenworth cab that parted from its trailer on some back-curve with stubs of grass and dirt still hooked in the door <p> a rail fence to keep out trespassers mostly now fallen <p> a house with a lean-to <p> an assortment of crankshafts fenders doors struts springs shocks engine parts <p> who knew what else <p> maybe not even Crowbar <p> the Trucks and Stuff sign by the road <p> a satellite dish and a fifteen-year-old James McAdoo for Sheriff sign in his yard . <p> Politics was still the latest . <p> Bigger than satellite dishes . <p> Crowbar would be a good husband for Renah . <p> James did n't know why Renah never married . Maybe no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was Sam Jackson from Sam 's Bait and Tackle over on Bull Shoals who had asked her . <p> And there was the traveling tool salesman . <p> Family meant something to Renah . She had their photos lined up on the kitchen walls and along the top of the pie-safes and on lace doilies that their grandmother had tatted . Hairpin lace or something like that . The old women always had their hands going . Back and forth like a litter of birds in the trees . All chirped up all the time . <p> A regular backhoe at anyone who passed . Dredging up . <p> Renah could do it . You got the whole story from her . Whether you wanted it or not . <p> The only thing she cut off , when she was behind the camera , was the heads in the photos , or at least above the nose so you kind of had to guess who it was by their trousers or dress . <p> She was a good woman , though . <p> After breakfast , Renah fed the hens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cemetery in the snow . <p> Renah had her Brownie camera with her . <p> She decided she would n't get out of the car , but honked James and Crowbar in the direction they should go with the Christmas basket for the parents . Since Tames could n't remember . Or could n't find the graves under the cover of snow . <p> Over this way . <p> Honk . <p> Now that . <p> Honk . <p> Not that way . <p> Honk . <p> Renah motioned them one way then another . Back to the left . There , James . <p> Honk . <p> In the car , Renah was warm as if she 'd never left her cast-iron bed in the kitchen all heaped with her string-tied rag quilts in the darkest purples and browns and maroons . <p> James and Crowbar swept snow from the graves . <p> Renah took a photo of James and Crowbar placing the basket . <p> I was n't even turned around , Crowbar said . <p> Won 'd make no difference , James answered . There 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her picture , anyway . <p> The car radio played Christmas music as they drove back to the road . <p> Then an advertisement for Burleens ' hair salon . <p> An Evangelist saying hallelujah to the snow-covered morning . <p> And the Singing Starbrites ! <p> Those sisters : <p> Juanita Bonita Corita Danita . <p> Their mother spit ' em out like peas . <p> James waved to a car that passed . Another Cherokee . A marginal Indian to the ones powwowing and migrating and buffaloing on the plains . <p> The Cherokee had been a robed and turbaned tribe with curled-handled pipes , writing and reading the letters of Sequoyah 's syllabary . <p> Full of superstitions and little-people tales , unless they 'd been converted to Christianity . Even at that , they were still full of both worlds . Sometimes conjuring . Sometimes singing hymns . Not knowing anything about being an Indian . <p> But a somewhat farming **25;182;TOOLONG **38;209;TOOLONG **27;249;TOOLONG few-hogged sort of folk . <p> Dry goods on the shelf a bag of material scraps in the corner <p> egg baskets apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> froes mallets drawknives string strips of oak and willow for more baskets <p> bittersweet sage herbs hanging by the woodstove <p> What kind of Indian that ? <p> Their backwoods jamming was enough to keep a regular Indian out . <p> James and Crowbar had n't been converted , Renah knew . She remembered them climbing out the vestibule window of the New Covenant Church . <p> That 's why they 'd come to Red Star from Nail ! The Spirit had delivered them to Renah for another chance to be saved . Hallelujah . She tossed in the seat as they drove back toward her cabin . Especially when they came over the hills , and saw into the distance of Arkansas . <p> They still almost could see the smoke from the old Cherokee pipes in the winter fog rising off the ice in the streams and farm ponds . <p> She told James and Crowbar how the ancestors had walked from the southeast on a forced march . Most kept going to Oklahoma . But theirs stopped here . <p> Except for the hand of God they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunted land . A magical kingdom of animal transformations and mutations of borders . Too much knowledge of the old ways . When no one would talk about it . That 's what they did . And a Christian God to whom they had to make a commitment . Who could come for them anytime . <p> There could be a revolution in Arkansas from the suppression of the old ways . Anytime . Gunshot heard nightly . Everyone digging in . Like squirrels spread-legged in the yard . Trying to uncover . <p> The Cherokee seemed like everyone else . Maybe another language leaping out once in a while . Little people under the house . Chimney smoke dancing on its front legs over the yard . Its hind legs in the air . But God waited for their decision . Just like everybody else . <p> I can see up into heaven , Renah said . Just up to God 's ears . I can see his son , Jesus , standing by his throne , a halo bright as an egg yoke hanging over his head . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can see God 's old truck parked behind his throne . I can see the long white hair that hangs to his shoulders . I just ca n't see his face . <p> James looked at Crowbar . <p> We 'd be BLIND if we did . Renah 's voice was rising again like heat from the woodstove , if they 'd been in her kitchen instead of James 's car . We ca n't stand the sight of purity . Here on earth . In these plank-floored cabins and leaning fields . The low roofs and high floors . <p> Yo , James said . It feels sometimes like my head is goint to meet my knees when I 'm sitting at your table . <p> The roof leaks snow , Renah told James . If it warms up , I 'll have to get the buckets , James . Otherwise I see it coming through like the joy of heaven . <p> Yes . <p> The former and latter rain often fell all day in buckets on Renah 's floor . Maybe James and Crowbar could repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband could fix it . <p> James ate an apple from the basket as they listened to Renah . <p> Got another one ? Crowbar asked . <p> The men chewed . <p> An apple works just like a piece of toast , James said . <p> It was another day under God 's grace . He must be in his hip boots and fishing gear . Warming his truck in his garage . Yes , God had it wrapped up . Had his inventory in line . His family photographs on the wall . His angels with their bright wings . Renah could almost see their faces , though she could hear their wings beating like a fan belt . <p> EEEEEeeee . <p> How those Starbrites could sing : <p> Tuana Bonita Corita Dorita . <p> Wuuh . Whhuuu . James and Crowbar could see their voices up there on the stage . <p> Around a curve in Newton County , just east of the Boston Mountains , a farmer 's truck loaded with chickens crossed the center line and hit James and Crowbar and Renah head-on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Renah stood up and shook herself off . Well , she was light as a feather herself . She walked down the road . Where was she going ? What happened ? <p> She saw James and Crowbar dazed in the truck . <p> Hens were flying up to heaven on their little wings like snow . Renah did n't know they could fly . Up over Arkansas . Past the woodcarvers in their cabins . Past hog farmers and turkey barns . The rocky soil . Logging trucks . Her goats and hens . She even saw the steam from the Dardanelle Nuclear Power Plant on Interstate 40 . The dam that Renah spelled d.a.m.b. whenever she said it . That 's the way you heard it around her . She would n't have it any other way . <p> And there was some sort of funny tag on her ear . <p> Renah even saw heaven spread out before her like hills in the distance of Arkansas . The trees were the heads of everyone who had called the name of Jesus . <p> And now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little like Floyd Buber , her father 's old friend . <p> She turned to tell James and Crowbar . <p> But they had their heads caught in the fork of a tree . And the Spirit of the air would n't let them pass . <p> They suddenly looked monkey-faced , and disappeared . Renah cried out , and tried to rush after them , but she heard the angels singing . <p> She saw the very face of GOD . Not just ears and nose as she imaged she 'd seen his body on the throne . But a whole forehead full of stars . A nose with two garages . A mouth like the opening of a backwood cave . Some sort of engineering design on his face . Well , he was a regular computer chip . She 'd seen a magazine in <p> doctor 's office once . A complicated crossroads of veins and connectives . A numbered face full of more than she could recognize at first . A whole being full of life and love . <p> The Starbrites had been right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told him of her love for GOD , and he took off the next day back to Bull Shoals . <p> The traveling tool salesman likewise . <p> But this God . And there was his son . He was the one who waited for her . He was in his old jeans down there at the end of the road where she now walked . Just like her vision had seen . <p>
