Yvon Dubois had been in New York for just a year . He lived in Hell 's Kitchen , which he called Clinton , maybe thinking that a different name would make the place different . The view from his living room was of the street and a brick apartment building , all of the windows boarded up with plywood except one , open with dirty curtains hanging out . A row of garbage cans was lined up by the iron fence , their covers chained to the railings . <p> Sunday afternoon , two men and a woman were sitting on the stoop to the entrance of the apartment building . The woman 's face was covered with sores . The men sat on either side of her , and none of them spoke , but looked out on the sunlit street , as Yvon , on the third floor , looked down on it through his dirty window . Stuck at the corners of the window were little squares of silver foil , like mounts holding a large picture in place , invisible except for dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm wires that ran from corner to corner . <p> Yvon saw a girl come along the sidewalk on the other side of the street , her shadow preceding her . She stopped , raised her arms over her head , and , her legs folding beneath her , she fell into her shadow . For a moment , Yvon thought that he was in fact seeing a faded , grainy picture that was mounted on the glass . The two men and the woman on the stoop stood ; the woman emitted a cry , and the two men grabbed her arms and pulled her into the building . <p> His scalp tightening , all the skin of his body tightening , Yvon ran to the door to his apartment and left it open as he rushed down the stairs to the street door , and he left this open , the burglar-alarm system beeping , to run across the street to the girl . She was lying face down , her long hair thrown forward over her head . <p> His impulse to raise her in his arms was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he kneeled by her and lifted her by her shoulders . Her head hung , and her hair dragged against the cement as he lifted her and turned her over . Her tongue stuck out through her shattered jaw and teeth . Her eyes were open . The alarm went off in the building where Yvon lived . <p> When the police arrived , the woman in the building with plywood windows came out and yelled , " Police , " but she stayed at a distance , watching , as two officers approached Yvon holding the girl . <p> As the ambulance drove off , one of the officers said the shooting was one of those crazy New York things , and the other told Yvon to go home and change his T-shirt , which had a circle of blood on it . The darkening afternoon was hot , but Yvon was shivering <p> Walking from his bedroom to the living room and back , again and again , he shivered , sometimes shuddered . When he looked down at the blood on his T-shirt , he had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He pulled the shirt off , and , not knowing what to do with it , he rolled it into a tight bundle and wedged it behind a cardboard carton at the back of the closet in his bedroom . Then he undressed and showered . <p> He was twenty-six , with the smooth , clear face of a boy who did n't yet shave . <p> Wet from his shower , he got into bed , and there he shivered , then yawned , then shivered again , and again yawned . Though he had a date to meet a friend in a bar , he stayed in bed . The room went dark . Before dawn , he got up and went into the alcove kitchen to make coffee . His attention kept shifting to details he had never noticed before , such as the scroll design on the handle of a spoon . <p> Not he , but someone acting separately from him whose motions Yvon followed , prepared to go to the college on Long Island where he taught French , and Yvon went with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot dawn . On Fiftieth Street , not far from where the girl had been killed , a black man in an overcoat was throwing down pieces of bread to pigeons with one hand and holding a net ready with the other , and Yvon saw him swing the net down and trap one of the flapping pigeons. lust as the man was stuffing the pigeon under his overcoat , he spotted Yvon , and he turned away . Yvon walked down Ninth Avenue to Penn Station . <p> Below ground , big fans moved the hot air about a group of people he stood among , waiting for the platform number of his train to appear on the board . He was sweating in the heat . Everyone was sweating . A black woman walked among them , holding up in one hand a piece of cardboard on which was written , in big capital letters , that she was deaf , and in the other hand a paper cup with change in it . Yvon stepped back from her when she approached him and he lowered his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quilt , was a white man with a red beard . A stream of pee flowed out from beneath the quilt . <p> As he was early at the college , he found the door to the secretaries ' office of the Modem Language Department shut . In his office , he sat on a wooden swivel chair at his old-fashioned brown wooden desk . The bookshelves were wooden , and the floor was bare wood planks . He sat still in the quiet . He thought of being in the town of Biddeford , in Maine , a graduate student at the college there . <p> Back in his apartment , he found messages on his answering machine  --  one from the friend he had had a bar date with , and another from a couple , Bill and Simona Perril , to remind him that they expected him for dinner . He telephoned his friend , if he could call him a friend , to say that he had had a lot of work to do , and he still did , and he told himself that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened would make him feel sick . <p> His concentration was focused on a hair in the bottom of the tub , a smear on the mirror , a dry bean on the counter in the kitchen alcove . <p> Showered and changed , whether or not he wanted to , he followed the person who now went ahead of him everywhere onto a crosstown bus to the East Side . Through the high , wide window of the bus , Yvon saw , in the nighttime lights , a man lying face down on the sidewalk , one arm extended as if reaching . <p> In the outside heat , he carried his jacket and walked slowly so he would n't sweat . In the air-conditioned lobby of the apartment building , Yvon put on his jacket . <p> A young man wearing a starched white cotton jacket and a black bow tie circulated in the air-conditioned room with a silver tray of drinks . With a gesture of his free hand held palm upward , he indicated the drink that had been asked for , and his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , and their collection hung in gilded frames on the white walls . <p> Simona Perril looked over Yvon 's shoulder and said to him , " Come with me , I 'll introduce you to someone you 'll like . " She introduced him to Nadia Turmanova . Just approaching middle age , her square face , with pale blue eyes , was soft about the edges of her jaw and cheeks , but completely clear . Her blond hair was short , almost as short as Yvon 's , and , like Yvon 's , hung in points over her ears . Her smile was slow but lasting . She was Russian . <p> He asked , " You 're really from Russia ? " <p> " That surprises you ? " She spoke English so well , it was as if , not she , but he had an accent . <p> " I never met a Russian before , " he said . <p> " Do you think we 're so different ? " <p> " I do , yes . " <p> " In what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always had such an idea of Russia . " <p> But Nadia looked away from him when , in a hallway through a double doorway at the end of the living room , a door opened and out ran a boy in pajamas , laughing . An Oriental girl , calling him and also laughing , ran after him , caught him , and brought him back into his room and shut the door . <p> Simona Perril said , " He wants to ruin the party . " <p> " Oh , " Nadia said , " he ca n't want that . " <p> Bill Perril said , " He does n't have a choice . " <p> Before Nadia could look back at Yvon , Simona said the guests should come with her to the dinner table , which was visible , at the far end of the hallway , set with candles in silver holders . Yvon was placed at a corner of the table , with Simona at the top and Nadia next to him . <p> When Simona and Bill and the six guests were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair , came running into the room , this time crying . He ran the length of the table , and , his arms out , he wobbled . His mouth was open so his bottom teeth , his lower gums and his tongue showed , and saliva dripped down his chin . Pushing her chair away from the table , Simona reached out for him and took him into her arms as he fell towards her . The au pair stood to the side . The boy howled in his mother 's arms , howled so his chest heaved . His mother held him close and , biting her lower lip , looked down the table at his father , who pressed his lips together so they vanished . <p> Nadia , leaning a little past Yvon , said to Simona , " But of course he 's upset , kept away from the party , kept away from his mother . Would n't anyone be upset and come crying ? " <p> The boy passed the back of his hand from one cheek to the other under his nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yvon and said , " Wo n't you come and sit on my lap ? " The boy studied her , then , his lower lip out , nodded he would quickly , Yvon stood and lifted him from his mother 's lap , his little body elongated , and placed him in the lap of Nadia . Then Yvon shoved his chair out from the table and turned to the boy in Nadia 's lap , and when Yvon put his hand on the boy 's head to smooth his hair , he was shocked by an uncontrollable sob , and , withdrawing his hand , he tried to pretend he had coughed . Nadia held the boy more closely to herself and whispered , " You must n't be sad  --  " The young man in the starched white jacket who had served the drinks was coming towards the table with a platter and Simona told the au pair to take the boy back to his room . <p> After dinner in the living room , Yvon , though he knew he should speak with others , sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed her hand on the cushion next to her . <p> She said , " You were going to tell me your idea of Russia . " <p> " I was , " he said , but he rested his head on the sofa back and said nothing . <p> " You 've forgotten ? " <p> " No . " Sitting next to her in the deep sofa , he felt not only that he was tired , but that he could fall asleep and she would let him . He closed his eyes , and when he opened them he saw she was still smiling . He said , in a low , dry voice , " To me , Russia is a country that Russians feel so much for , if Russia is suffering , all Russians , even those who have food and warm apartments , suffer with Russia . " <p> " That is your idea of my country ? " <p> Yvon rolled his head against the back of the sofa . " It is , " he said . <p> Nadia touched his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in Russian , and Nadia spoke to him in Russian . She said to Yvon , " I must go , " and she left with the man . Yvon also left . <p> In the humid heat outside , he took off his jacket . On Fifth Avenue , the lights of cars , shining as if with the hard points of hurtling stars , fell , all at different speeds , down a wide sky rack , on either side of which was a diffused , pinkish glow . The headlights bounced up and down and sometimes swerved from side to side . <p> The cracked , bulletproof shield between the passengers and the driver was half open , and the driver 's creased black neck was wet with sweat . He drove through Central Park and down the West Side . At a red light , Yvon saw , out on the sidewalk , sitting , knees up , against the wall of a brick building , a man with long lank hair wearing a leather vest and no shirt . His toothless mouth was caved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle in a brown paper bag . The brick wall behind him was sprayed with aerosol graffiti , and above him the illuminated dirty windows of the building were shut but for one , from which torn curtains hung out . <p> In his bedroom , he undressed and lay on his bed , unmade . He turned over onto his stomach , his head twisted to the side , and closed his eyes . Images of New York came to him , images of a discarded shopping cart , a burnt-out rubbish bin , a wrecked umbrella in a gutter , a battered mailbox , a large cube of dirty ice melting on a sidewalk , an armchair burning in an alley , a doorway filled in with cemented cinder blocks . Turning onto his back again , he placed his hands on his chest . <p> In his office at the college , he heard , through the wall , a woman professor talking with a foreign student , who was having trouble getting on at the college . The professor asked , " What do you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I am feeling despair . " <p> The professor laughed . She said , " No , not despair . You see , you do n't say , in English , ' I feel despair ' for what you must feel . That 's too strong . " <p> " What do I feel ? " <p> " Perhaps what you feel is stress , " the professor said . <p> " Stress ? " <p> " Perhaps you would say you are stressed about not doing very well here , stressed about the possibility of failing . " <p> " But I would not say ' I am feeling despair ' ? " <p> " No . " <p> The autumn remained hot , then , in one day , turned into cold winter , with a heavy dark sky that lasted weeks . One Saturday , pulling out the cardboard box from the closet in his bedroom to open it , Yvon saw , behind it , the rolled up T-shirt . He felt he was withdrawing from touching it at the same time he picked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blood was brown . He could n't throw it away , and he also could n't wash it . He folded it and put it in the bottom <p> Saturday afternoon , he was supposed to go to a bar to meet a few friends , but instead he went , as he liked going , to the minor art galleries on the Upper East Side to look at paintings , little landscapes and interiors and still-lifes of books and stamped envelopes and brass candlesticks . To get into a gallery he had to ring a bell , and an attendant came and first looked at him through the glass before opening . Inside , the carpets were dove-gray , the paintings , in molded , gilt frames , tilted on pale walls , and there were a couple of delicate , white-and-gold chairs . At the back of the gallery Yvon found Nadia Turmanova studying a painting . <p> Seeing him , her blond , open face opened even more and brightened with pleasure , and she almost reached out to kiss his cheek , but then she caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a picture here by Isaac Levitan , and I came to have a look at it before I go back to Russia tomorrow . " <p> " Tomorrow ? " he asked . <p> They both studied a narrow landscape under snow , with a sunset behind birch trees . <p> When Yvon turned to Nadia , she said to him , smiling , " I 'm glad to see you again . " <p> In a hotel restaurant on Fifth Avenue , they had coffee by a window through which they could see the last leaves of the trees in Central Park fall . Snow would surely fall from the heavy , dark sky . <p> " I remember your idea of Russia , " Nadia said . <p> " My idea ? " <p> " You do n't remember telling me ? " Yvon laughed , a small , embarrassed laugh . " I remember , " he said . <p> Leaning forward , Nadia reached across the round table and put her hand on Yvon 's hand resting beside his coffee cup . <p> Her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their palms were pressing together . A moment later , he opened his fingers and withdrew his hand from hers , and she did n't move her open hand . <p> He called for the bill and sat back and did n't speak . But , leaving the hotel with her , he asked her if she had time for a walk in the park . She appeared to be surprised , and , smiling , said yes , she did . As they walked along the paths , under the trees with bare black branches and one or two leaves , she picked up a leaf and held it out for him to see , dun-yellow . <p> On a bench along the path were three people , a woman with a man on either side of her , wrapped in clear plastic sheets through which their dirty clothes were visible . The woman , bareheaded , had long stringy hair and a bloody mouth and nose . The woman looked at Yvon and Nadia as if from a great distance , and then she closed her eyes and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic covered lap of one of the men . <p> Snow began to fall . " Russia is descending on us , " Nadia said . <p> They walked to the other side of the park and down Ninth Avenue . On a comer of Fiftieth Street , where Yvon stopped , men were unloading sacks of potatoes onto the sidewalk . <p> Nadia said , " I must go . I am leaving very early tomorrow morning . " She smiled her slow , lasting smile . <p> Yvon hailed a taxi for her . The taxi swerved a little in the snow when it braked beside them . Yvon opened the door . The taxi , swerving , sped off , and Yvon concentrated on the red rear lights and the illuminated license plate . <p> In his apartment , he stood at a window and watched the snow fall . It was not strange for an American , brought up so much in the awareness of Russia , to think of Russia as the other country . Even when he was a boy in Maine , walking home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond , and beyond the thin trees the purple-pink arctic sun setting , he would think : This must be like Russia . <p>
