Walk Two Moons A Face at the Window Gramps says that I am a country girl at heart , and that is true . I have lived most of my thirteen years in Bybanks , Kentucky , which is not much more than a caboodle of houses roosting in a green spot alongside the Ohio River . just over a year ago , my father plucked me up like a weed and took me and all our belongings ( no , that is not true -- he did not bring the chestnut tree , the willow , the maple , the hayloft , or the swimming hole , which all belonged to me ) and we drove three hundred miles straight north and stopped in front of a house in Euclid , Ohio . " No trees ? " I said . " This is where we 're going to live ? " " No , " my father said . " This is Margaret 's house . " The front door of the house opened and a lady with wild red hair stood there . I looked up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a row of birdhouses . In front of each house was a tiny square of grass , and in front of that was a thin gray sidewalk running alongside a gray road . " Where 's the barn ? " I asked . " The river ? The swimming hole ? " " Oh , Sal , " my father said . " Come on . There 's Margaret . " He waved to the lady at the door . " We have to go back . I forgot something . " The lady with the wild red hair opened the door and came out onto the porch . " In the back of my closet , " I said , under the floorboards . I put something there , and I 've got to have it . " " Do n't be a goose . Come and see Margaret . " I did not want to see Margaret . I stood there , looking around , and that 's when I saw the face pressed up against an upstairs window next door . It was a round girl 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it then , but that face belonged to Phoebe Winterbottom , a girl who had a powerful imagination , who would become my friend , and who would have many peculiar things happen to her . Not long ago , when I was locked in a car with my grandparents for six days , I told them the story of Phoebe , and when I finished telling them -- or maybe even as I was telling them -- I realized that the story of Phoebe was like the plaster wall in our old house in Bybanks , Kentucky . My father started chipping away at a plaster wall in the living room of our house in Bybanks shortly after my mother left us one April morning . Our house was an old farmhouse that my parents had been restoring , room by room . Each night as he waited to hear from my mother , he chipped away at that wall . On the night that we got the bad news -- that she was not returning -- he pounded and pounded , on that wall with a chisel and a hammer . At two o'clock in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not asleep . He led me downstairs and showed me what he had found . Hidden behind the wall was a brick fireplace . The reason that Phoebe 's story reminds me of that plaster wall and the hidden fireplace is that beneath Phoebe 's story was another one . Mine .
