By taking on truly bizarre cases  --  from defending tobacco companies to child molesters  --  the old left 's favorite interest group is undermining its reputation and cheapening free speech <p> Foes of the American Civil Liberties Union believe it has veered off to the left ; friends argue that friends should not criticize a beleaguered champion of the freedom of speech . But only those who keep close tabs realize that the ACLU has gone silly . <p> The ACLU used to play an important role in our nation , particularly in the protection and expansion of First Amendment rights . Many of the principles for which it fought are now taken for granted . Prior to 1920 , the year the ACLU was founded , the Supreme Court had never upheld a free speech claim under the First Amendment . In its first year , the ACLU helped gain the release of hundreds of prisoners whose only crime had been that they spoke out against World War I. During Word War II , the ACLU provided one of the few voices that condemned the relocation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ACLU was a leader in the battle against the McCarthy era " loyalty oaths . " Even these days , occasionally it still gets the job right . A case in point is the ACLU endeavor to protect the jobs of whistleblowers . <p> But even ACLU aficionados did a double take when they read that the organization had marshaled its legal big guns to protect the rights of lawyers to file misleading bills . The case involved none other than Senator Alfonse D'Amato 's brother Armand , who was convicted of fraud in a plan to influence the senator . Armand collected money from a corporation by billing it for legal services that were never performed . In exchange , Armand promised the corporation access to Senator D'Amato . Several bar associations attacked the ruling on the flimsy grounds that such a billing practice is common among lawyers and that it is protected by client-lawyer privilege . When New York ACLU representative Arthur Eisenberg was asked what the hell possessed the ACLU to side with Armand , he explained : The ACLU is concerned that D'Amato would be convicted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud statute , and the ACLU believes the wording of these statutes is not sufficiently precise . Got it ? <p> When the new mayor of New York City , Rudolph Giuliani , tried to get kids back into school by drawing on new community police officers to help locate truants , the ACLU protested . The executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union , Norman Siegel , told a reporter that " the cops see these kids as criminals ; educators see them as consumers of school services . You have two different views , and this is not the way to go . " It is far from self-evident what is wrong if , indeed , it is the case that police and teachers see things differently ; I bet that the fire department and sanitation officers look at the same kids in still different ways . Actually , the facts are that the police , far from arresting the truants , simply shepherd them to schools , where everyone agrees they belong . <p> Some recent ACLU peculiarities have explanations , but you will not find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserve the right of the tobacco industry to advertise cigarettes . The ACLU argues that all it is doing is sticking to its traditional defense of commercial free speech , a fundamental part of the First Amendment . Legal scholars may well raise some questions about the standing of commercial speech as distinct from political and social speech . But all in the know will raise at least one eyebrow when they learn that the ACLU also fought a congressional bill that would have cut the tax deductibility of tobacco promotions . And they 'll raise the other eyebrow and much more  --  when they learn that the ACLU received more than $500,000 in contributions from the tobacco industry  --  and did not disclose this to the public or its members . If some other group , say , one that favors a ban on pornography , pocketed $500,000 on the q.t. from , say , the Christian Coalition , you can bet the ACLU would be in its face . <p> To be fair , the ACLU is at least consistent . While Common Cause , People for The American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically all other reform-minded groups strongly oppose the unlimited flow of private money into the coffers of elected officials in the form of campaign contributions to politicians , the ACLU maintains that the flow should go on uninhibited on the ground that " money is speech . " In effect , it accepts and legitimizes the self-serving arguments of special interest groups that use PACs to sway legislators  --  that this money gives citizens opportunities to participate in democratic politics . The fact is that contributions are collected from individuals who are not allowed to designate which politician will receive the PAC money . Funds are granted to whomever is favored by the managers of PAC associations ( such as the National Rifle Association , various banks , and several labor unions ) . As a rule , contributors to PACs are not told even after the fact who got their bucks . Some democratic participation . <p> But more importantly , the ACLU has never been able to explain satisfactorily how its position in support of unbounded money bags is compatible with a free give-and-take of ideas . Private money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge , expensive amplifier to a town meeting and drowns out everybody else . Money buys consultants , studies of the hidden crevices of the public 's ' mind , and massive TV ads . Candidates without deep pockets do poorly in elections dominated by money , no matter what the content of their messages . Champions of free speech should seek to ensure that all are able to speak freely . <p> When it comes to metal detectors in schools , the ACLU is truly daffy . The detectors are a measure of the desperation of schools that face , on an average day , 135,000 children who come to school with loaded guns . While the detectors do not solve the problem , and clearly much more needs to be done to stem violence , screening reduces gun fatalities . The opposition to this measure is led by the Southern California chapter of the ACLU , which opposes not merely the gates but also the expulsion of students caught carrying guns . Expulsions , it argues , may consign students " to a life even more disadvantaged than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's better for all students to learn in fear of being shot than to expel the ones carrying guns . <p> Even if the ACLU has a good case , you can rest assured that it will find a way to ride it ad absurdum . Its protection of the right of youngsters to wear T-shirts that display social and political slogans is a sound part of its protection of free speech . However , its active opposition to dress codes in schools and shopping malls is stretching matters too far . The ACLU 's regional director in Texas questioned the constitutionality of dress codes imposed by malls that discourage certain clothing items favored by gang members , such as bandannas and baggy pants . The ACLU 's argument , absurd as it sounds , is that baggy pants and bandannas are forms of political expression . Personally , I ca n't see much political content in any kind of pants . <p> President Clinton proudly waved in front of the nation the symbol of his universal health care plan  --  a national health security card . The card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care resources , vital if waste is to be curbed . It could also allow potential patients to carry in their pockets their medical histories and other relevant information on the cards ' magnetic strips , to be " read " by whomever the cardholders choose . <p> Not so fast , says the ACLU . Jan Lori Goldman , head of the organization 's project on privacy and technology , explains : " The problem is that the databases are enticing . People want to use them for other purposes . " What are these other nefarious purposes ? Seeking deadbeat dads , university graduates who welshed on their student loans , and illegal immigrants . But these people violated the law , and the public is clearly in need and fully entitled to find them and help ensure that they will make amends ( pay up , ship out , etc . ) . It 's far from evident why such applications of a database are troubling to the point that we should forgo the health care card . Moreover , would anybody be better off  --  other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by drawing on a separate database for each subgroup instead of a single comprehensive database ? <p> The ACLU recently honed its long-standing talent to find , in a world full of the downtrodden , the most bizarre cases . In New York City , a teacher is openly advocating having sex with young boys . He is a leader of NAMBLA ( North American Man/Boy Love Association ) , a national association whose slogan is " sex after eight is too late . " And the reference is not to eight in the evening . The teacher has been suspended until hearings are completed about his future assignment ; the ACLU argues that his right to speak is being violated . However , even the ACLU acknowledges that one may not shout fire in a crowded theater ( though it often adds , " unless there really is a fire " ) . Presumably the reason the ACLU is willing to tolerate an exception to the First Amendment is that the " proximity " of the cause ( shouting ) to public harm ( being trampled ) is closer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from self-evident . Just as not every time one shouts fire do scared crowds overran people , so not every time a teacher advocates molesting young children are they actually abused . However , the probability may well be just as high and the crime at least as hideous . Unless you believe that the only value we care about is free speech , we are entitled to wonder whether parents should be expected to leave their children with an advocate of pedophilia . It 's like allowing those who advocate arson to be in charge of fire safety in schools . Meanwhile , if the ACLU tries , it may be able to find at least somewhat more worthy causes to assign to its lawyers . <p> The ACLU trivializes rights and adds to litigiousness when it pursues many of these cases . Our liberties would be better protected if the ACLU would focus its zeal where it matters , rather than on drummed up , far out , or indefensible cases . <p> BY AMITAI ETZIONI <p> <p> Amitai Etzioni is the author of The Spirit of Community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the founder of the Communitarian Network . <p>
