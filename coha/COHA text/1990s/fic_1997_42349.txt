Someone told me there was an open corner on Valerio Trujano , but before I could get it I 'd have to be " nut-cracked . " I do n't want to say exactly what that involved because even though I 'd bet there is n't one speck of shame left in me , there 's at least something that tries to get rid of bad memories . <p> I was just starting out . I 'd only jumped on the bandwagon a few days before , when the Trujano girls gave me the chance , by allowing me a small spot next to them . And despite the fact that the guy who " cracked nuts " was constantly hanging around , it was much better to be there and run the risk of seeing that dry face and those waterless eyes with no lashes and that bony carcass , than to spread myself all over town . <p> What 's more , on Valerio Trujano my fear went away . After about two or three weeks I could n't even feel it anymore-like it had realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me the shakes pretty often , it was able to go hide when I needed it to , maybe because-for sure-it was afraid I 'd send it away to live by itself , because , as far as I know , the only thing that fear is afraid of is loneliness . <p> That was when I met the man who would later be my husband . . . <p> One night a man came up to me . That in itself was n't special , because that 's why I was there , so men would come find me . But the man who came up to me that night stood out from all the others because he had a baby in his arms . A little child , the kind that still needs people to get him from one place to another . <p> When I saw this man right next to me , I figured he 'd come to beg , because he stuck out his hand like he was asking for money . I was about to give him some when he asked my price . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . " <p> " Not like what ? " <p> " Not with what you 're carrying there . " <p> " This sort of thing does n't interest him yet , " he said . " On the other hand , it would n't be a waste of time to start learning . " <p> Not wanting anything to do with him , I looked around , searching for one of the girls , who might get me out of a tight spot . But there were n't many , and they all had customers . <p> " Maybe you 're looking for someone in particular , " I said , " someone you 've been with before . " <p> " I came for you , " he said . " Just tell me how much . " He did n't seem to understand I was n't going anywhere with him as long as he was carrying his rug rat . <p> " Just tell me how much , " he said again . <p> So I gave him a very high price , maybe ten times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Let 's go . " <p> I did n't like this at all . But I was also thinking that the man who " cracked nuts " would n't give us a room in the hotel . And that 's exactly what happened . As soon as we crossed the entryway , we felt the breeze from his bony hand shooing us out . <p> " See ? " I said to the guy . " Now do you see it 's impossible ? " <p> We were back on the street . He put his arm around my waist and led me off , like that . <p> " I know a dark place . . . the guy in charge likes money more than appearances . They 'll let us . " <p> I looked at the little boy , who was squirming in his arms . He had an adult 's eyes , full of badness , up to no good . I figured they were probably a pretty good reflection of how depraved we were . <p> I wished he 'd start howling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take his kid and leave . That 's what I was thinking when the little boy 's eyes began to laugh . He stretched out his arms to me and bounced around , laughing with me , showing me the only tooth in his mouth . <p> " See ? " says the guy , " He wants to go with you , too . " <p> The kid was wrapped like a tamale , rolled up in a blanket . I pressed him against my neck , patting his backside so he 'd sleep . But that boy was n't tired ; he twisted around like a worm and searched with his mouth for the place he knew food came from . Tugging and scratching , he pulled open my blouse until his hands could grab at my breasts . <p> " This kid 's hungry , " I said to the guy . <p> " We have time , " he said . " We 'll feed him later . " We reached the door of a hotel , and he stopped me . <p> " Is this it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right here . " <p> We went in . We crossed a patio where there was a clothesline and when we started up the stairs we heard this shrill voice screaming at us that the place was not a nursery . <p> So we kept going , went everywhere , through the streets of Ogazon . His name was Claudio Marcos . No , the boy was n't his . He belonged to a good friend . It was just that he had volunteered to take care of him because today the friend was celebrating . Well , he celebrated every day , but he 'd never been so stupid about it before . <p> That 's why he had taken the child from the bar , so the boy would n't keep hitting his head every time the father fell to the floor . And since the friend was already out of it , it was easy to take the boy from him . The fun would come the next day when he woke up and saw the little boy was n't there and could n't figure out where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him home ? " <p> " That 's where I was going . But when I saw you , I changed my mind . I thought the boy would do fine with us tonight . " <p> " That 's your idea of fun ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " Nothing . " <p> " I 'd already spotted you , " he said . " But I could n't get up the nerve to talk to you . With that face you do n't look like you 're cut from the same cloth as the others . I even believed you might just be taking a walk around the neighborhood . " <p> " So where are we going ? " I asked . <p> He paid no attention , he kept walking and talking . <p> " The best thing would be for you to take the boy to his mother , " I told him . <p> " We would n't get anywhere with that , " he told me . " It 's somebody else that feeds him . " <p> We turned onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little park called Plaza de los Angeles , a policeman came up to see who I was . <p> " Do n't spread yourself too thin , Olga , " he said . <p> " Who 's he talking to ? " Claudio Marcos asked me . <p> " Me . " <p> " Did n't you say your name 's Pilar ? " <p> " One name 's as good as the next . For what it 's worth , " I told him , I was already pretty annoyed . " What we have to do is get back , I 'm way out of my territory . " <p> We made it to Santiago Garden and sat down on a bench . The little one had fallen asleep on my shoulder . And although he did n't weigh much , he was so thin , I just could n't find a way to get rid of him . I also could n't explain to myself why I was going along with any of this , much less how we were going to go to bed together with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem like the guy would ever stop chattering . <p> " Listen , " I said , I got serious , " this boy ought to be asleep in his own bed . You ought to take him there . And if his mother does n't feed him , then you do it , just because that 's the right thing to do . " <p> " You think it 's time for him to eat ? " <p> " I do n't know , " I told him , " but just looking at how skinny he is makes me think he has n't had a mouthful to eat in his whole life . " <p> " Oh , no . Not true . I definitely do n't agree with that . The boy eats . He eats a ton . Just today at noon he polished off half a dozen tortillas . He also likes chili and bean soup . He eats all that stuff . Now , if you do n't believe me , we 'll go somewhere . I 've got fifty pesos . We 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food for the three of us . O.K. ? " <p> Actually , I was n't hungry . We stopped at the first sandwich shop we found . And there , with all those people , with the sticky smell of frying sausage , I forgot my situation , how I was hanging around with this man next to me . And it occurred to me that he 'd probably forgotten , a while back , what he had picked me up for in the first place . <p> We ate . Besides his own food , he ordered a glass of milk and some little sandwiches . <p> He sat the boy on his lap and began giving him bite after bite of sandwich soaked in milk . When the boy finished the first sandwich , he ate another and then a third . The boy would gnaw on them with his one tooth till the bread was chewed up , then he made a ball out of the paste and just swallowed the whole thing . <p> " See ? He does n't choke , " this character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so big because his parents have been packing him full of food ever since he was born-everything you can get in bars . Having a throat this big is good for him . " <p> " While we 're on this topic , " I said , " what the hell are you doing with this boy , if he has a mother who 's supposed to take care of him ? " <p> " You 're referring to my good friend Flaviana ? " <p> " I do n't know which of your good friends I 'm referring to . But this is n't going to be much of a night for me . I wo n't even earn bus fare . " <p> " I 'm going to pay you . Or do you want me to pay in advance ? " <p> " No , " I told him . " What I want is to go check my spot on the street . There might be somebody waiting for me . " <p> The truth is , I was afraid of the " nutcracker . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen with a client who was carrying a child , which had to be against the rules , as I was for what the " nutcracker " must be thinking-suspecting I wanted to cheat him . And then there was his daily tax ; he never let it slide , even if you were vomiting blood . <p> The guy who called himself Claudio Marcos got all thoughtful . Then he said , " I 'm a gravedigger . Are n't you surprised I 'm a gravedigger ? Well , that 's what I am . I 've never admitted it , but what I earn is pathetic . It 's like everything else . With one advantage : it gives you the pleasure of burying people . I 'm telling you this because , like me , you must hate people . Maybe even more than me . And I 'd like to give you some advice : do n't ever love anyone . Leave the whole business of loving people alone . I remember I had an aunt I loved a lot . She died all of a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got out of that was a heart full of holes . " <p> I was listening . But that did n't take my mind off the " nutcracker , " with those sunken , silent eyes of his . Meanwhile here was this guy chatting with me about how he hated half the world and how it was a beautiful thing to know how to bury , one by one , the people he used to see every day . And that when someone from here or there said or did something bad to him , he did n't get mad-he kept his mouth shut and promised himself to leave them untended for a long time when they fell into his hands . <p> " . . . No , I do n't feel bad about dead people . Even less about live people . I finished with all that , fifteen years ago . At first it made me very sad when I 'd bury the mother of a swarm of kids , and they 'd let themselves go , howling and yelling , and they 'd stick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four of us to pry them off . I 've had to help out in tons of cases like that . But now , that 's over . When there 's a burial , you 've got to bury the sadness , too . <p> " It 's the live ones that 're an embarrassment . Do n't you think so ? Dead people do n't fight with anyone , but the live ones , they ca n't figure out enough ways to humiliate other people . They 'll even half-kill themselves just to wreck someone else 's heart . That says it all . On the other hand , there 's no reason to hate dead people . They 're the greatest . They 're all good . The best people on earth . " <p> " Let 's get out of here , " I said . " I 'm suffocating . Let 's get some air . " <p> When we were back on the street , the rancid smoke of the fried food followed us for a while . He had stuck the boy under his jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . <p> " Now that you 're standing up , I remember something , " he said . " My good friend Flaviana does n't have anything here , " he added , rubbing his chest . " Now , if she had them like you do , they 'd probably be full of booze , so they would n't be any good for fattening up a little creature , anyway . <p> Then I asked him if he did n't take advantage of this Flaviana , when his friend spent the whole night in a bar . <p> After a while , he answered no , since there was no way-she was never away from her husband . <p> " They get drunk together , they go everywhere together , until they either fall down or forget where they are . " <p> I almost was n't listening anymore . I wanted to go to sleep . But he thought we could hole up for a while in some doorway , where we could be alone , like away from the world . <p> " I had the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth is , I 've known what you look like for a long time , but I like you better when I dream about you .... Then I can make what I want to , out of you . Not like now , when , you can see , we have n't been able to do anything . " <p> It was almost day . It smelled like day , although the ground , the doors and the houses were still dark . <p> Sleepiness drove me across the street to look for a hotel . The guy followed me . He stopped me : " Do I owe you anything ? " <p> " No , nothing , " I said . <p> " I made you waste your time . You should charge me what you usually make in a night . " <p> I got away from him . I opened the door and looked for the first empty room . I stretched out on the bed , still in my clothes , I shut my eyes tight , and like my body was floating , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street with a broom . Someone inside asked , " Will we see each other again ? I still feel like talking with you . " <p> I felt him sit down at the foot of the bed . . . <p> He 's the same guy sitting on the edge of my bed , now , silent , his head in his hands . He just unstuck himself from his post at the bars of my window , where he usually spends the night waiting for me to come back . He 's told me lots of times I 'm not really me when I get home late , we 'll never finish getting to know each other . <p> " . . . Or maybe we will , " he says , " maybe when I 've got you safe in the ground , the day I have to bury you . " <p> What he does n't realize is that I want to sleep . I 'm tired . I guess he 's forgotten the agreement we made when I married him : he 'd let me rest-otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a woman wrecked by the wear and tear of men . . . <p>
