I KNOW , THINGS TASTE BETTER fresh , not packaged . Hamburger clots your arteries and hurts the rain forest . We should eat like our stone age ancestors , who dug roots , got lots of exercise , and always stayed a little hungry . So they say . <p> Still , I balked when my wife served me termites . <p> " Come on , sweetheart . Try one . They 're delicious . " <p> Gaia already had the hive uncrated and set up by the time I came home . Putting down my briefcase , I stared at hundreds of the pasty-colored critters scrabbling under a plastic cover , tending their fat queen , devouring kitchen trimmings , making themselves right at home in my home . <p> Gaia offered me a probe made of fine-grained pseudowood . " See ? You use this stick to fish after nice plump ones , like chimpanzees do in the wild ! " <p> I gaped at the insect habitat , filling the last free space between our veggiehydrator and the meat-sublimate racks . " But . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " <p> " Oh , sweety , I know you 'll just love them . Anyway , do n't I need protein and vitamins for the baby ? " <p> Putting my hand over her swelling belly normally softened any objections I might have . Only this time my own stomach was in rebellion . " I thought you already got all that stuff from the Yeast-Beast machine . " I pointed to the vat occupying half of our guest bathroom , venting nutritious vapors from racks of tissue-grown cutlets . <p> " That stuff 's not natural , " Gaia complained with a moue . " Come on , try the real thing . It 's just like they show on the NatuLife Channel ! " <p> " I . . . do n't think . . . " <p> " Watch , I 'll show you ! " <p> Gaia passed the stick-probe through a sealed hatch to delve after six-legged prey , her tongue popping out as she concentrated , quivering with excitement from her red ponytail down to her rounded belly . " Got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the hatch and to her lips . <p> " You 're not seriously . . . " My throat stopped as the termite vanished , head first . <p> Bliss crossed Gaia 's face . " M-m-m , crunchy ! " She smacked , revealing a still-twitching tail . <p> I found enough manly dignity to raggedly chastise her . <p> " Do n't . . . talk with your mouth full . " <p> Turning away , I added  --  " If you need me , I 'll be in my workout room . " <p> Gaia had rearranged our sleep quarters again . Now the cramped chamber merged seamlessly with a tropical paradise , including raucous bird calls and mist from a roaring waterfall . The impressive effects made it hard navigating past the bed , so I ordered the hologram blanked . Silence fell as the vid-wall turned gray , leaving just the real-life portion of her pocket jungle to contend with  --  a tangle of potted plants warrantied to give off purer oxygen than a pregnant woman could sniff from bottles . <p> Wading through creepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamper and threw in my work clothes . The fragrant Clean-U-Lichen had already sani-scavenged and folded my exercise togs , which felt warm and skin-supple when I drew them on . The organo-electric garment rippled across my skin as if alive , seeming just as eager for a workout as I was . <p> I 'd been through hell at the office . Traffic on the commuter-tube was miserable and the smog index had been red-lining for a week . Termites had only been the last straw . <p> " Let 's go , " I muttered . " I have n't killed anything all day . " <p> Long Stick spotted a big old buck gazelle . <p> " It limps , " my hunting partner said , rising from his haunches to point across a hundred yards of dry savannah . " Earlier , it met a lion . " <p> I rose from my stretching exercises to peer past a screen of sheltering boulders , following Long Stick 's gnarly arm . One animal stood apart from the herd . Sniffing an unsteady breeze , the buck turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this prey was a pushover compared to last Sunday 's pissed-off rhino . The virtual reality machine must have sensed I 'd had a rough day . <p> My hands stroked the spear , tracing its familiar nicks and knots . An illusion of raw , archetypal power . <p> " The beaters are ready , Chief , " my hunting partner said . I nodded . <p> " Let 's get on with it . " <p> Long Stick pursed his lips and mimicked the call of a bee-catcher bird . Moments later , the animals snorted as a shift in the heavy air brought insinuations of human scent . Another hundred yards beyond the herd , where the sparse pampas faded into a hazy stand of acacia trees , I glimpsed the rest of our hunting party , creeping forward . <p> My hunters . My tribe . <p> I was tempted to reach up and adjust the virtu-reality helmet , which fed this artificial world to my eyes and ears . . . to zoom in on those distant human images . Alas , except for Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunters up close . Good persona programs are n't cheap , and with a baby coming , there were other things for Gaia and me to spend money on . <p> Yeah , like a cramroy termite hive ! Resentment fed on surging adrenaline . Never trust a gatherer . That was the hunters ' creed . Love ' era , protect ' era , die for them , but always remember , their priorities are different . <p> The beaters stood as one , shouting . The gazelles reared , wheeling the other way  --  toward us . Long Stick hissed . " Here they come ! " <p> The Accu-Terrain floor thrummed beneath my feet to the charge of a hundred hooves . Sensu-Surround earphones brought the stampede roar of panicky beasts thundering toward us , wild-eyed with ardor to survive . <p> Clutching my spear in sweaty palms , I crouched as graceful animals vaulted overhead , ribcages heaving . <p> Meanwhile , a faint , subsonic mantra recited . I am part of nature . . . one with nature . . . <p> The young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But then , trailing and already foaming with fatigue , came the old buck , its leap leaden , unsteady , and I knew the program really was taking it easy on me today . <p> Long Stick howled . I sprinted from cover , swiftly taking the lead . The auto-treadmill 's bumps and gullies matched whatever terrain the goggles showed me , so my feet knew how to land and thrust off again . The body suit brushed my skin with synthetic wind . Flared nostrils inhaled sweat , exhilaration , and for a time I forgot I was in a tiny room on the eightieth floor of a suburban Chitown con-apt , surrounded by fifty million neighbors . <p> I was deep in the past of my forebears , back in a time when men were few , and therefore precious , magical . <p> Back when nature thrived . . . and included us . <p> Easy workout or no , I got up a good sweat before the beast was cornered against a stand of jagged saw grass . The panting gazelle 's black eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw tales of past battles and matings . Of countless struggles won , and finally lost . I could n't have felt more sympathy if he 'd been real . <p> My throwing arm cranked and I thought  --  Long ago , I 'd have done this to feed my wife and child . <p> That was then . As for here and now ? <p> Well . . . this sure beats the hell out of racquetball . <p> Mass-produced con-apt housing lets twelve billion Earthlings live in minim decency , at the cost of dwelling all our lives in boxes piled halfway to the sky . Lotteries award scarce chances to visit mountains , the seashore . Meanwhile , Virtuality keeps us sane within our hi-rise caves . <p> On my way to shower after working out , I saw that Gaia 's private VR room was in use . Impulsively , I tiptoed into the closet next door , feeling for the crack between stacked room units , and pressed my eye close to the narrow chink of light . Gaia squatted on her treadmill floor , shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit fit her pregnant form like a second skin , while helmet and goggles made her resemble some kind of bug , or star alien . But I knew her scenario , like mine , lay in the distant past . She made digging motions with a phantom tool , invisible to me , held in her cupped hands . Then she reached down to pluck another ghost item , her gloves simulating touch to match whatever root or tuber it was that she saw through the goggles . Gala pantomimed brushing dirt away from her find , then dropping it into a bag at her side . <p> Sometimes , eavesdropping like this , I 'd feel a chill wondering how odd I must look during workouts , leaping about , brandishing invisible spears and shouting at my " hunters . " No wonder most people keep VR so private . <p> Gaia tilted her head as if listening to somebody , then laughed aloud . " I know ! Did n't the two of them look funny ? Coming home all proud with that skinny little squirrel on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from gobbling half our carrots ! " <p> Naturally , I could n't see or hear Gaia 's companions  --  presumably other women gatherers in the same simulated tribe she had been visiting since years before we met . She stopped again , listening , then turned around . " It 's your baby , Flower . That 's okay , I 'll take care of him . " She laughed . " I need the practice . " <p> I watched her gently pick up an invisible child . Her body suit tugged and contracted , mimicking a wriggly weight in her arms . Awkwardly , Gala cooed at an infant who dwelled only in a world of software , and her mind . I crept away to take a shower , at once ashamed of spying and glad that I had . <p> Toweling my wet hair , I entered the bedroom to find the wall screen tuned to Mother Earth Channel Fifty-Three  --  a green-robed priestess reciting a sermon . <p> " . . . returning to more natural ways does not mean having to sacrifice nil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her closet wearing a bright cotton shift over her blossoming figure , sorting through a cloth bag slung over one shoulder . " Where are you going ? " I tried asking , but the life-sized matron on the wall was doubly loud . <p> " . . . we should eat like our ancestors , who caught meat but twice a week or so . All other food was gathered by skilled women . . . . " <p> I tugged Gaia 's elbow , repeating my question . She startled , then smiled at me . " NatuBirth class , Sweetheart . Lots to learn before I 'm ready . Just two months left , you know . " <p> " But I thought . . . " <p> " . . . Fats and sweets were rare back then , hence our cravings . Now self-discipline must take the place of scarcity  --  " <p> I shouted . " Computer ! Shut off that noise ! " <p> The priestess 's mouth moved silently . Gaia looked reproving . <p> " I do n't like being left out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh Toms , do n't be off-baud . We 're just covering nest and birthing methods , tonight . A man would be bored . " <p> Hm . Maybe . Femismo says there are some things men ca n't understand . Quite a shift from the way old-fashioned feminism preached sharing all life 's duties . My dad used to proudly tell of cutting the cord , the day I was born . I kind of liked that idea , but now they call it unnatural . Birth has always been a female ritual . That 's what they say . <p> " You just stay home , be good , and . . . " Gaia pressed against me , affectionately , her eyes lighting . " You had a good hunt , did n't you ? I can tell . It always leaves you frisky . " <p> I pulled away . " Mph . Go to class , then . I 'll be okay . " <p> She tiptoed to kiss my chin . " Look by the console for a present . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gala blew another kiss from the front door , and was gone . <p> I wandered over to the master house controller and picked up a brightly colored program plaq , still tacky where Gaia must have peeled off a discount sticker from the NatuLife Store . Something for the Hunter , the title read , and I snorted . Right . Something to keep the man of the house distracted beating drums with a bunch of make-believe comrades , while a wife 's attention turns to serious matters  --  nesting and the continuity of life . The blyware gift might have been meant as a loving gesture , but right then it made me feel superfluous , more left out than ever . <p> Sliding the plaq into the console , I accidentally brushed the volume knob and the booming voice of the priestess returned . <p> " . . . must face the fact that Earth 's billions wo n't accept returning to nature by scratching mud and sleeping on dirt floors . We must learn new ways , both more natural and smarter . . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks it knows what " smarter " means . <p> LONG STICK greeted me with a sweeping bow , at once both sardonic and respectful . " Welcome back , oh Great Chief . " <p> " Yeah , yeah , " I muttered at my simulated sidekick . " Okay , I 'll bite . What 's different , this time ? " <p> Everything seemed less real here in the living room , with my virtuality helmet and body suit left hanging in the closet . The familiar , primeval forest of my private world now cut off sharply where the vial-wall met the couch . Yet , I could have sworn my ersatz companion seemed subtler , warmer , somehow . <p> " The flint-smiths are ready to show their wares , chief . " <p> " The who . . . ? " I began . But Long Stick simply turned to begin striding down a nearby path . The living room had no treadmill-floor , so I stood still , watching Long Stick 's buckskin-draped form plow past trees and boulders and down a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinny clatter of brittle objects colliding and breaking . Finally , we reached a sandy streambed where several figures could be seen sitting on logs , hammering stones together . <p> Oh , yes . Flint-smiths . NatuLife stocked countless " You-Are-There " programs in all the ancient arts , from bronze casting to automobile design . With our shared interest in the Neolithic , Gala had cleverly bought a stone age simulation the computer could fit right into my private world , to help me pass an evening while she trained for motherhood . <p> Okay , I sighed . Let 's get on with it . <p> A youngster with a wispy beard noticed us , stopped hammering , and nudged the others  --  a weathered old man and a sturdy-looking fellow with one leg much shorter than the other . The smiths rose and bowed respectfully . Naturally , these would n't be full scale sim-personas , like Long Stick , but animated actors in a limited scenario . <p> " We have worked those chert cores you traded from Seacliff Tribe , oh Chief , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Would you like tO see ? " <p> I shrugged . " Why not ? " <p> He spread a fur and began laying out an assortment of neolithic cutlery , glinting under ersatz sunshine . There were spearheads , axes , burins and scrapers  --  plus other tools I could n't identify offhand  --  each item the product of at least a hundred strokes , skillfully cleaving native rock into shapes useful for daily life . A prehistoric kitchen , armory and machine shop , all in one . The smiths offered to let me feel an edge . It was disturbing to watch the computer manifest an image of my own hand , holding an object I could n't feel . I resolved to try again later , replaying the scenario with body gloves on . <p> " Well , it 's been interesting , " I said after a while , feeling fatigued . " But I think that 's enough for n  --  " <p> A high shout broke in . Everyone looked past my shoulder , but the scene remained obstinately riveted until a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slimmer than the others , this one strode with a springy , elfin gait , clothed in the tunic and leggings of a hunter . The newcomer carried a bundle of slender wooden saplings the right size for fashioning spears . Only when these were dumped with a clatter did I note with surprise that this hunter was female . <p> " Ho , Chief , " she greeted me , acknowledging Long Stick with a nod . <p> My companion leaned over and muttered , " This is Ankle-of-a-Giraffe , daughter of Antler and Pear Blossom . She is one of the beaters in the hunt . " <p> " That 's what I want to talk to you about , " the young stone-ager said , planting fists on her hips . She was lithe and a trifle lean for my tastes  --  as well as being smudged from head to toe  --  but she made eye contact in a bold , provocative way . " I 'm sick of just beating , Great Chief . I want to be in on the kill . I want to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Long Stick rambled . " Ankle ! You forget yourself ! " <p> The girl bowed submissively , yet her eyes held fierce determination . She seemed ready to speak again when I shouted . <p> " Freeze frame ! " <p> All action halted , leaving the " tribesmen " locked in time . A blue jay hovered in suspended flight across the gully while I wrestled with confusion . It was n't the idea of a female hunter . . . plenty of tribes allowed it , according to tradition . But why complicate matters with such a player right now , just as the simulation seemed about to end ? What did it have to do with prehistoric tool-making ? <p> " Computer . This is n't just a packaged you-are-there , is it ? " <p> " No it is not . These are fully autonomous persona programs , operating stochastically in your private sire world . " <p> So , Gaia had been generous after all ! Long Stick was no longer my only , full-scale companion . But how could she afford . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhanced to allow up to five flexible personae at any one time . " <p> " Oh , I get it . " <p> Gaia must have needed more memory for her own programs , the midwives and doulahs and other helpers she 'd need when the baby came . The expense was already budgeted . No wonder she could throw in a few extra playmates for me , purchased at discount . After wondering for a minute whether to feel hurt , pleased , or amused . . . I finally decided it did n't really matter . I hesitated , then decided . <p> " Computer , hold simulation for transfer to my rec room . " <p> Minutes later , fully suited for virtuality , I held one of the tool-knappers ' new flint knives in my hands , each curve and serrated edge conveyed by subtle , electrochem gloves . The stone-smiths seemed pleased by my admiration . It was a good knife , of the finest obsidian , bound to an ivory handle carved with figures of running horses . Despite not being real , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The treadmill worked beneath my feet , mimicking movement as Long Stick and I finally departed the neolithic factory , heading toward Lookout Point to observe migratory herds of wildebeest and eland crossing the plain . Along the way , we passed the young beater , Ankle , squatting by the river bank where she 'd been banished by Long Stick for impertinence . Tying stone points to spear-shafts , tightening the leather thongs with her teeth , she looked up as we passed by , unrepentant , a light of challenge in her eyes . <p> I paused , then turned to Long Stick . " We could use a scout to carry messages . Next hunt , bring this one along . " <p> My simulated friend returned one of his sharp looks , but nodded silently . Ankle turned away , wisely hiding a jubilant grin . <p> I emerged from my primeval world to find Gaia already home from her class , nestled in our small , darkened bedroom . I slipped between the sheets quietly , but soon felt her hand upon my thigh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife whispered , her breath warm on my ear . <p> Pregnancy does n't exactly mean no sex . Doctors say it 's all right if you 're careful . <p> In fact , it can be much better than all right . Gaia was very skilled . <p> The buffalo groaned , mired in muddy shallows with five spears in its flank . I commanded no more thrown . <p> Ankle protested , waving her javelin . " Why not finish it off ? " <p> " Because the Chief said no ! " Long Stick snapped . But I gestured for patience . With Ankle for an apprentice , I now appreciated the adage  --  You never really know something til you teach it . <p> " Think . What happens if he falls where he stands ? " <p> She eyed the panting beast . " He 'll fall into the riv . . . Oh ! We 'd lose half the carcass . " Ankle nodded soberly . " So we try getting him ashore first ? " <p> " Right . And quickly ! We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made pious gestures in agreement . Through ritual , hunters like these used to appease the spirits of beasts they killed , which made me wonder  --  would modem folk eat so much meat if they had to placate the ghost of each steer or chicken ? My time in a simulated stone age has n't made a vegetarian of me , but I better appreciate the fact that meat once lived . <p> Long Stick called for rope . Bearing coils of braided leather , we worked toward the bull from three sides . The treadmill imitated slippery mud beneath my feet , while the body suit tickled nerves so that I felt hip-deep in slimy water . Electronically-stirred receptors in my nose " smelled " the creature 's blood and defiance , above the rank swamp stench . It was hard work , floundering toward our prey . Harder and more varied than lifting weights in a gym , and more terrifying . The buffalo shifted left and right , bellowing and threatening with its horns . <p> Everything had seemed more vivid since Gala bought that extra memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Watch out ! " Ankle cried as it lunged . I swerved and felt a wall of fur and muscle glance off my shoulder , rushing through space I 'd just occupied . Teetering in the mud , I glimpsed a snaking lasso chase the old bull , landing round its neck . <p> " Got him ! " Long Stick cried . <p> " My turn ! " called a higher voice . Ankle cast her lariat  --  only to fall short as the angry beast thrashed aside . <p> " Wait ! " I cried when she plunged after it . Too late , I watched the girl vanish beneath the frothy , scummy surface . <p> " Ankle ! " <p> Suddenly , I was too busy dodging to worry about my young aide . Sharp horns flashed viciously . While I knew the computer would n't kill me , other slipups in the gym had left me bruised for weeks . <p> She 's only a program , I told myself , backpedaling from a roaring shaggy face the size of a small pickup . Programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The cry coincided with a sudden change in the creature 's bellows . It whirled and I blinked in astonishment . The young hunter , Ankle , had clambered on its back ! Dripping water and marsh reeds , she held tightly to its mane and slipped her noose over the shaggy head , while the bull snorted , wild-eyed and convulsing . Others joined her exultant shout as ropes pulled taut from three directions . <p> Resignation seemed to settle over the animal then , as it let itself be drawn toward dry land . Two meters . . . three . . . <p> Suddenly , in one last , desperate heave , it reared . Ankle flew off , arms whirling to splash near the bull 's stomping hooves . <p> With a shout I dove toward her . <p> Or tried to . Today 's virtuality tech ca n't fake buoyancy , so the machine would n't cooperate . The body suit did let me flounder forward , though , evading the thrashing horns while flailing underwater in search of my apprentice . Frantic seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a slim arm ! A small hand closed vice-like round my wrist as I yanked back hard . . . just as the buffalo pitched over , toppling with a mighty splash on the spot where Ankle had lain . <p> We made it ashore downstream from where the tribe was already commencing the frenetic ritual of butchery . In olden times , a kill like this came at best once a month , so these hunters sang their joy to the spirits of water , earth and sky . But the artful ceremony was wasted on me as I slogged uphill , feeling pressure leave my cramping legs exactly like water slipping reluctantly aside . The weight in my arms seemed all too real as I lowered Ankle to a patch of grass . <p> This was an awful lot of trouble to go to , just for a piece of software . I might have rationalized that good persona programs are expensive , but the thought did n't cross my mind as I hurriedly checked Ankle 's breathing . Pale , mud-grimed from crown to toe , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashes of abalone blue as her eyes popped open . Ankle gasped a sudden , stricken sob and threw both arms around my neck . <p> " Urk ! " I answered . Never before had my exercise togs yanked me down so , into such a flood of sensations . Pain lanced my palms from impacting pebbles . Sunlight spread heat across my mud-splattered back . Then there was the press of her warm body , clinging beneath mine , much more cushiony , in places , than I had imagined . <p> Soon I realized Ankle no longer clung to me for comfort . She was moving breathing in ways having little to do with reassurance . I grunted surprise for a second time , and reached up to pry loose her arms . " Stop simulation ! " I shouted . <p> My last glimpse , before yanking off the helmet , was of Ankle lying there , muddy all over , wiry-strong and hunter-attired , yet suddenly utterly female , gazing at me both worshipful and willing . <p> She was only software  --  bits of illusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . <p> She was already the second most desirable woman I had ever known . <p> Now get this , I love my wife . Always figured myself one of those lucky bastards whose woman understands him , inside and out , and despite that thinks the world of him . <p> So , I figured , there 's got to be a mistake here ! <p> Trembling I peeled off my sweaty body suit and stumbled into the shower , wondering , How am I going to explain this to Gaia ? <p> Then , while soaping myself , I thought , What 's to explain ? I did n't do anything ! <p> Rinsing I pondered , And if I had ? Would it 've been adultery ? Or an exotic form of masturbation ? <p> I recall how Morn blithely tolerated Dad 's collection of mildly erotic magazines , apparently quite unthreatened by his harmless , private fantasies . Nor did Gaia ever seem to consider my electronic Playboy subscription a rival . Sometimes she would dial it up herself . . . . " for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy , visually stimulated autoeroticism was okay , I also knew it would hurt her terribly if I ever had a real-life affair . <p> So . . . what had nearly taken place in my VR gym ? The experience seemed to fall somewhere between bolting a co-ed and an encounter with an inflatable doll . <p> Too bad they never produced that sci-fi gimmick , a direct computer-mind interlace . Then I might have dismissed any sim-adventure as something purely mental . But so much of what we are and do is tied up in our bodies . . . the nerves , hormones and muscles . To have a truly vivid experience , you must take your meat along . <p> With flesh taking part , virtuality can mimic any surface . I 've crawled across grass and tide pools and steaming sands while stalking prey . <p> But simulating a woman . . . ? <p> " Hi-tech marches on , but this is ridiculous ! " I laughed , drying under a blast of warm air , then put on a terry cloth robe and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife in the nursery , where she had been humming while sorting things for the baby , and cheerfully wished me a " good hunt . " <p> Gaia was n't there , but I felt a warm glow just looking around the little room , its walls decorated with hologram mobiles and floating planets . I had installed most of the nursery equipment myself , including the bottom-baster , with its simmering vat of Liquid Diaper . The flotation crib would be programmed to mimic my wife 's heartbeat and other rhythms , comforting baby 's first weeks with sensations familiar from the womb . <p> This was where my life was anchored , I thought . Not in some make-believe hunting band that femismo psychologists thought every modem man required . My family . For all its pollution , crowds and exhaustion , the real world was where you lived real life . <p> " Gaia ? " I asked , searching the living room . " You 'll never guess what happened . . . " <p> She was n't there either . I tried the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still no sign of her . <p> Funny , I thought . She had n't said anything about another NatuBirth class tonight . <p> " Computer , did my wife leave a message where she was going ? " <p> The control voice answered . " Your wife has n't left the apartment . She is in her Virtuality Room . " <p> " Ah . . . of course . Her turn . Must have gone in while I showered . " <p> I sat on the couch gingerly , still feeling tremors from this evening 's hi-stress workout . I picked up the remote control and scanned tonight 's cable listings . Besides the normal thousand channels of infotainment , there were amateur-rids , pubforums , hobby and spec-interest lines , two-way chatshows , and " Uncle Fred " showing slides of his blimp-ride to Everest . The usual stuff . I fell back on dialing a good book from the library , and actually stared at the first page of Robinson Crusoe for about ten minutes before pounding the cushion beside me . <p> " Hell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetch a drink . . . then to go to the can . . . then to look in the closet for my tennis shoes . . . Maybe I 'd go outside for an old-fashioned walk . . . . <p> I found the sneakers where I 'd left them , near the crack in the closet wall . Leaning close , I heard soft sounds coming from the room next door  --  my wife 's private sanctum . <p> They were n't sounds of conversation , but exertion , heavy breathing . <p> Well , gatherers also used to work hard , netting fish , cutting wild grain . . . . <p> I knew I was rationalizing as I brought my eye to the crack . <p> Wearing helmet and body suit , Gaia squatted much as the last time I had seen her in this place , hands outstretched and down before her , as if grasping something . Underneath , the treadmill-floor mimicked an oblong hummock which she straddled while strenuously rocking back and forth . Whatever she was doing in her private world , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocked back and I heard her moan aloud . <p> I knew that sound . I looked again at the shape beneath her , and saw that it recreated no patch of ground , no fallen log . Even without goggles for seeing , earphones for hearing , or gloves for touching , I could tell the outlines of a man . <p> I NEEDED THOSE sneakers , after all . I left at once , and took a walk along the sky bridges lacing the gray metropolis at the forty story level , overlooking the maze of transport tubes and vibrating machinery which keeps the city alive . Looking up past the towering canyon walls of Chitown , I could see no stars , just a hazy glow diffused by pollutant haze . Late at night , I should have been grateful for the countless Public Safety cameras , peering from each lamp post . But they only made me feel conspicuous , supervised . On the veldt , you do n't fear being victimized by a million strangers . Twenty thousand years ago there were no strangers . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a local bar , under a 4-D holoneon sign with one dimension burned out . The beer was excellent , the atmosphere depressing . Other men sat nursing drinks , scrupulously avoiding eye contact with those around them . A wire-o in the comer kept dropping quarters into a stim-zap machine , then sticking his head under the hood for direct jolts of electric pleasure . His sighs were sterile , emotionless . <p> Gaia 's had been throaty , lusty . <p> Now I knew where she had learned that provocative , swaying motion  --  the one she 'd used the last few times we made love . Apparently , she had a tutor , a good one . One I would never meet , let alone get to punch in the face . <p> Fair is fair , I thought . Had n't I already rationalized my own encounter with sex-by-simulation , before finding out that Gaia was doing it first ? If it fell into the category of masturbation for me , and not infidelity , then why not for her ? <p> That 's different !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could n't see how . My " rival " was a phantom , no threat in real terms . He could never impregnate Gaia , or give her a disease , or boast of cuckolding me to my business partners , or ever take her away from me . <p> What it really came down to was the mental image , provoking jealousy at a deep , gut level . Jealousy based on ancient drives a civilized man should be able to overcome . <p> I was no longer sure I wanted to be a civilized man . <p> No , I did n't get roaring drunk , or provoke a fight with the big guy two stools down . I thought about it , but what the hell ? By now I was much too skilled at killing to trust myself in a friendly brawl , out in the real world . Anyway , my neighbor also looked like he worked out . Maybe , for exercise , he took scalps with Cochise , or rode with a VR Genghis Khan . Under our gray urban disguises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and left . <p> Gaia was dozing on the couch when I got back , or pretending to be . She seemed relieved to have me home , and I tried not to show my inner turmoil . I turned on the TV wall and she , sensing it wiser , went to bed . <p> Half an hour later , I slipped into my body suit and re-entered my private world . <p> Weeks passed . Gala grew larger . We spoke little . <p> My consulting firm finally won the Taiko Tech account , worth millions . I rushed home and celebrated with Ankle by first killing a lion , then making love by a cool bend in the river . We lay together , listening to locusts and the wind in the swaying branches , while a dry heat seemed to suck all the dank , fetid odors of the office out of my skin . Tension at work had left knots up and down my spine , which Ankle worked out with her strong hands . <p> She listened quietly to my recitation of setbacks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . That did n't matter . My VR people knew and accepted that their chief spent most of his time far away , in the Land of Gods . In a way , Ankle was the perfect , uncritical sounding board . <p> If only it had been that simple dealing with the hanging , unspoken tension between me and Gala . Ankle would have listened to that , too , but what was there to say ? <p> The whole thing was preposterous and my fault . Why should it bother me what my wife did in fantasy play ? <p> It did bother me . It was starting to split us apart . <p> " I want to show you something , " Ankle announced , picking up her clothes and evading my grasp . " Come , " she urged . " Long Stick can send some boys for the lion . There is something nearby you must see . " <p> I shrugged into my tunic . " What is it ? " <p> She only smiled and motioned for me to follow . Still wrestling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she led me toward a forested rise . It lay in the direction of " Camp , " the fictitious home base I had never seen during all of my workouts with small groups of hunters . It would have taken so much computing power to process a full tribe that it simply never occurred to me to journey in this direction . <p> We reached the top of the rise and soon picked up faint sounds . . . human voices , talking and laughing . We approached stealthily , crawling the last few meters to peer over a steep bluff . There we saw , a couple of hundred meters downslope , a small gathering of people clustered around an oak tree . They were using tall poles to bat away at an object high in the branches . Occasionally , one of them dropped her pole and hopped about , swatting at the air while others laughed . <p> Gatherers , I realized . Going after a beehive . This was my first glimpse of the other half of my " tribe . " Calmly , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that one of the unaccompanied ones was decidedly pregnant . . . . <p> My breath suddenly caught as I recognized the rotund , laughing figure . <p> All this time , Gaia and I had played in our own pretend neolithic worlds , and never guessed they were different pans of the same tribe ! <p> It had n't started out that way . We had bought the original versions of our programs separately , before we even met . But in retrospect it seemed an obvious thing for the computer to do . . . to save memory space by pooling our adventures in the same metaphorical landscape . <p> " It affects us , " Ankle said . <p> " Who ? " <p> " We . Your folk . " She motioned toward the gatherers , slapped her own chest , and waved toward the east , where the hunting parties roamed . " It hurts us . " <p> " What hurts you ? " I asked , perplexed , distracted . <p> " The break . . . the pain between you two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new turn of events to follow what she was saying . I peered at the figures below , and saw two men among the women down there , helping to steal honey . Just as some women could be hunters , certain males might choose the rites and rhythms of gathering . Probably , one of them was my rival , Gaia 's synthetic paramour . <p> Suddenly it seemed important to get closer . But as I made ready , Ankle stopped me . <p> " You can not , " she said . <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " Certain charms are needed . To unite us . Unite the tribe . " <p> " Charms ? " <p> She nodded . " From the Land of Gods . " <p> After a pause . " . . . Oh , I get it . " <p> She meant more memory , much more . Until recently , I had hunted with just one companion , then ten or so . Joining the two simulated worlds , depicting several score personified characters , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that was no problem ! I had a big raise coming . I could go right out and buy the chips on credit ! My fist clenched in anticipation . By this time tomorrow , I 'd get a much closer look at the bastard who . . . <p> Suddenly , the laughter below broke under a single , warbling cry . One of the women dropped her pole and doubled over in agony , clutching her swollen abdomen . <p> I did n't stop to think . With a bellow I came to my feet , running downhill toward the petite form , writhing amid a cluster of anxious women . " Gala ! " I cried , frustrated that the ground grew tarry with each step . The gatherers , too , seemed to blur around the edges as I neared , one heavy step at a time . The earth trembled and Ankle clutched my arm . <p> " Not that way ! " she screamed , cringing as I whirled in anger . " You must go ! " She slapped the side of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realism of it all ! <p> Cursing I tore off the helmet , gashing my cheek on the strap . The body suit still formed a matrix of other-world sensations  --  hot savannah wind and gritty moccasins . But abruptly my eyes saw a tiny , off-white chamber , its coarse floor of needles mimicking a steep hillside . Sense-conflict made me sway in confusion as I dove for the door . <p> " I 'm coming Gaia ! " I cried , stumbling into the hallway in haste to reach my wife . <p> They 're making a big deal out of it . I 've been interviewed on some of the lesser zines . There 's even talk of reviving childbirth classes for husbands . But it 's just silly , all the fuss . Any other man would 've done the same . What matters is that everything turned out all right . <p> Tommy junior thrives as his stim-crib cases him into the gaudy multi-world . He 'll grow up in Chitown , and on Mars , in mythic Greece and a neolithic clan . He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a teen , he 'll live out fantasies lads of my time only imagined . Still , even his generation will learn to tell what 's real . Reality is what still hurts when you take the suit off . <p> Gaia and I solved our problems once our tribes united . Each of us still plays with personas now and then . Despite all the sudden yammerings of the neo-prudes  --  who could resist ? Anyway , we always come home to each other , and that 's what counts . Virtuality is fun  --  it 's good to be the Chief - but nothing matches the sweetness of her real skin , or the unpredictability of her real mind . <p> My blood pressure is low . My arteries are squeaky-clean and muscles wiry , strong . I stay a little hungry , like my ancestors , and may live past a hundred . In a cramped world of twelve billion souls , I can run for hours seeing no one but gazelles , or a lonely hawk . <p> Lions know to give me a wide berth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm content to be a man . <p> Give me time . I 'm even learning to like termites . <p> <p> By David Brin <p> David Brin has won the Hugo , Nebula , Locus , and John W.
