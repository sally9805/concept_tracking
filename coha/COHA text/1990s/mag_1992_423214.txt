With the implementation of progressive marketing strategies , Mexico 's telecommunications industry is ringing off the hook <p> WHEN DOUG CLARK ARRIVED IN MEXICO two years ago to oversee Northern Telecom 's operations , few Mexicans possessed fax machines , even fewer had cellular phones , and the company 's entire 13-employee sales staff could fit into one conference room . Today , Northern Telecom de Mexico occupies the entire second floor of an ultramodern glass skyscraper on posh Avenida Insurgentes ; it employs 60 full-time salespeople and another 400 maquiladora factory workers on contract , and boasts annual revenues in excess of $80 million . At the same time , fax machines hum in nearly every office in this sprawling metropolis of 18 million people , 100,000 of whom use cellular phones on a daily basis . <p> In fact , Northern Telecom supplies five of Mexico 's nine regional cellular operators . Last September it won a $21 million contract for 10 operator positions and 1,500 operator switches from Telefonos de Mexico ( TELMEX ) , the country 's recently privatized telephone conglomerate . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a native of Cambridge , Ontario , and a 10-year Northern Telecom veteran . " We 're probably the fastest-growing Canadian company in Mexico . " <p> Northern Telecom 's chief competitor , Motorola  --  which supplies the other four cellular companies  --  is equally bullish on this nation of 88 million people . " The fact that the current government has decided to rapidly implement market strategies to open the economy and pursue free trade happens to fit us very well , " says Jose Baviera , Motorola de Mexico 's director-general . " We feel very good , we are enthusiastic , and we are certainly supportive of the effort . " <p> Mexico 's telecommunications explosion  --  dramatic for a country where nine out of 10 families still do n't even have telephones  --  is the result of three factors : President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 's 1988 lifting of import restrictions , which has opened up the Mexican economy ; the privatization of Telmex , which is expected to lead to rapid improvements in basic phone service , and the pending North American Free Trade Agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada , the United States and Mexico into a $6 trillion trading bloc , the world 's largest . <p> " Three years ago , the economy was opened to imports for the first time , " said Jorge Arredondo , spokesman for Ericsson de Mexico . " Barriers were reduced , so businessmen began to buy terminal equipment they did n't have access to before . The phenomenon of fax machines is directly tied to expansion of the economy . Before , you needed a license to import one fax machine . Legally , you could n't connect other apparatus to the phone line , although many people did it . Now , everyone has a fax , and the public is more demanding , more critical . " <p> Experts put the 1992 market for imported computer hardware and software at $1.5 billion , with most of that equipment coming from the United States , Japan , Brazil and the United Kingdom . Likewise , over the next five years , Telmex will spend between $9 billion and $14 billion on expansion . That , combined with a government-ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unleash a market for telecom-related equipment that could hit $750 million by 1994 . " The Mexican economy has to be a lot more efficient to compete in an environment of openness . So we have to modernize at an accelerated pace , " says Carlos Mier y Teran , subsecretary for communications at Mexico 's Secretariat of Communications and Transportation ( SCT ) . " Telecommunications has a direct impact on almost every aspect of the economy . " <p> One telecom firm alone , Ericsson , enjoyed sales of $500 million last year , making it the 24th largest industrial concern in Mexico . A subsidiary of Stockholm-based L.M. Ericsson and a forerunner of Telmex itself , Ericsson de Mexico operates a 70,000-square-meter factory in Tlalnepantla , outside Mexico City , where 2,000 workers produce switches for public and private networks . Another 3,000 Ericsson employees at a plant in San Luis Potosi assemble copper and fiberoptic cable . <p> Telmex buys 70 percent of Ericsson 's annual production , according to Arredondo . " Demand has increased enormously . Use of the phone network in the last three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No longer is it used only for voice . There 's an incredible growth in faxes , bank transfers using the phone network , and authorization of credit cards in public places , " he said . Jose Tovar Martinez , general manager of the communications division of Condumex S.A. and president of the Mexico chapter of the Institute of Electric and Electronic Engineers adds , " Privatization means an opening up of the market . In terms of telecommunications , the Free Trade Agreement means local manufacturers will face bigger competition . I ca n't yet measure the sequences of the FTA , but in my view this country must compete globally . Our industry in particular can compete with quality products and service . " <p> The Telmex privatization , in which a consortium composed of Southwestern Bell , France Telecom and Grupo Carso ( a Mexican manufacturing and mining conglomerate ) paid $1.76 billion for a 20.4 percent controlling interest in the company , was completed on December 20 , 1990 . The remaining stock was sold to the general public , and Telefonos de Mexico has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Stock Exchange . " We 're particularly impressed with how well the Mexican economy is doing . President Salinas ' actions have given us a lot of confidence in the country , " said Southwestern Bell spokesperson Linda Lockett . " We serve Texas , which has a 1,000-mile border with Mexico , and about 20 percent of our Texas employees are Hispanic , so we feel at home in Mexico . " <p> Currently , Telmex operates 5.5 million lines , or about 6.6 lines per 100 inhabitants , compared to 54 per 100 inhabitants in the United States . Carlos Kauachi , the company 's executive vice-president for telephone development , says , " we intend to add 750,000 lines per year through 1994 , to incorporate all of the 18,000 locations that have more than 500 people , to increase public phone density from 0.5 per 1,000 to 2 per 1,000 . We are committed to deliver every request for telephone service in no more than six months prior to 1995 . Now , on the average , it takes about a year . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of Mexico and in Sweden , has spent more than half his 51 years with Telmex . Among other things , he is credited with bringing direct distance dialing to Mexico . Kauachi acknowledges that his company suffers an image problem among the Mexican public  --  it logged some 50,000 consumer complaints during 1991  --  but urges subscribers to be patient . " We have a backlog of about 1.1 million lines of pent-up demand , " he said . " The present situation is very critical . Continuity of service is between fair and poor , and throughput is fair . Crosstalk and noise is a problem in Mexico City . About 80 percent of our problems are in the external plant . It will take years for us to fully recover from the 1985 earthquake . One reason is the damage inherent in the system , such as twisted cable . You do n't know about it until water gets into it . " <p> Kauachi said Telmex plans to install 96,000 public phones throughout the country , while adding 77,000 long-distance circuits , an 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already building a fiberoptic network of 13,500 kilometers to tie in all the major cities , and are installing 33 new operator centers of the most advanced technology . " <p> The SCT concession regulating Telmex gives the company a monopoly on long-distance service for the first six years , though by 1997 , other companies will be able to compete in that market . According to Kauachi , the number of long-distance circuits between the United States and Mexico will increase by 45 percent over the next three years , partially to meet demands of maquiladora firms , which bring U.S. components into Mexico , assemble them into finished products in sprawling factories that employ low-cost Mexican labor , and then truck the products back over the border to the companies ' primary market : the U.S. consumer . Hundreds of companies already operate maquiladoras , including computer and telecom giants such as IBM , Digital , Unisys , Motorola and AT &T,; which manufactures answering machines in Guadalajara , keyboards and monitors in Monterrey and transformers in Matamoros . <p> With the advent of a North American Free Trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though Kauachi said U.S. investment in Mexico is sure to increase , as will the need for good communications links . " Any maquiladora that wants to establish a high-quality telecom link with the world can now have it . The rest of the network will be improving gradually , but we decided to do this part quickly . This will cover 30 cities . Every city along the border is already served by the network . " Kauachi believes the free trade agreement will have a dual effect on the Mexican telecommunications industry . " On one side , it 'll create a lot of pressure on the business community to become effective . Either they 'll succeed or they 'll be sold . For society , it will be extremely beneficial . We have been too conservative in the past , and as a result we 've lost many opportunities . " <p> Kauachi said most of his company 's 50,000 employees will not have to worry about losing their jobs since the expansion program will require additional workers . Among the improvements is the introduction of cellular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TelCel , whose chief supplier is Ericsson . In Band A are nine companies which correspond to Mexico 's nine geographic regions . Five of these firms  --  Telcom del Golfo , Cedetel , Movitel , Portatel and Iusacel ( which includes Mexico City and its environs )  --  are supplied by Northern Telecom . According to Nortern Telecom 's Clark , Mexico now has 140,000 cellular phones in service , about 100,000 of them in the Federal District , 10,000 in Monterrey , 6,000 in Guadalajara , 4,000 in Tijuana-Mexicali and 20,000 elsewhere . In Mexico City , up to 3,000 subscribers sign up every month , despite the monthly $800 to $2,000 service fee . " The introduction of cellular has made a tremendous difference , " Clark said , " but it 's expensive , and has n't filtered down to the average Mexican . " <p> One alternative to cellular phones is two-way radio , notes Teresa Ortiz , local marketing and planning manager at Motorola , Mexico 's leader in two-way technology . " With cellular phones you have to dial each number , wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times mover expensive than two-way radio , " she said . " Our users are very different . With radio , you can talk to hundreds or thousands of people listening to the same channel . Motorola 's Jose Baviera says 500,000 people are already using two-way throughout Mexico , and that if cellular 's popularity is any indication , the market for two-way radios could reach $100 million . " Cellular was studied for years . All those studies showed the market could sustain 10,000 units in the first year . The moment it was implemented , 35,000 people signed up . " <p> In addition to making cellular service available to the general public , Telmex has also completed an " overlay digital network , " known in Spanish as Red Digital Integrada , for high-volume business clients . In this context , Telmex offers 105,000 private lines and 6,000 private circuits ; Kauachi says " this is at least 50 percent of the reason why companies contract services with this network . " <p> The SCT 's Mier y Teran , whose agency is charged with monitoring Telmex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see gradual improvements by the end of this year . He estimates that Telmex will grow 12 percent a year , offering the business sector the most advanced digital services at the same time it improves the basic network . " The strategy is to privatize Telmex in order to fulfill these goals , independent of our function of authority . We will regulate the company very carefully . But the last thing we 're thinking about is taking away the concession . We want them to be successful .
