Imagine it is 1994 . The economy is still stagnating , Japan remains in the doldrums as well , interest rates are rising , and the deficit has reached $600 billion . Something has to be done  --  and quickly . President Ross Perot , making good on a campaign promise , gets on the horn to the TV networks and organizes one of his famous electronic town meetings . That night , before a television audience Murphy Brown would die for , he lays out the nation 's precarious economic situation and the stark choices the U.S. confronts . Even before his presentation is over , the returns begin to pour in  --  by telephone , fax , computer modem , videophone and two-way interactive cable TV . By morning , the will of the American people is clear : they have decided to cut back on Social Security payments , further slash military spending and raise their own taxes . <P> That 's how teledemocracy is supposed to work , according to Perot , the billionaire computer executive and putative presidential candidate . The concept has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paralysis of Congress and the special-interest outrages that characterize politics-as- usual , the idea that the citizenry might bypass all the musty machinery of representative democracy and directly influence the government seems enormously attractive . <P> In speeches and interviews , Perot implies that the technology required to create an electronic town meeting is already in place  --  an impression reinforced by events like his much ballyhooed satellite broadcast last Friday that linked Perot rallies in six different states . Participants in five U.S. cities could hear one another cheer the candidate as he spoke to them from Orlando . To have a truly interactive town meeting , however , a number of technical barriers must still be hurdled . And even if that happens , it is not at all clear that the result will be any way to run a country . <P> When he describes his plan for taking the pulse of the people , Perot seems to assume that viewers will have access to some sort of interactive television network . Such a system would allow couch spuds to register their opinions simply by pressing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interactive television does not yet exist  --  except in a handful of small pilot projects  --  and it has not been determined who will provide the service when it does arrive . <P> The phone companies and cable-TV systems are jockeying for position in what each views as a potentially vast market but which neither is ready to create . Stuart Brotman , a communications specialist in Lexington , Mass. , estimates that cable operators would have to spend $20 billion to $30 billion on digital-compression and fiber-optic technology to prepare their systems for interactive programming . The telephone companies , for their part , would have to invest $300 billion to $500 billion in fiber-optic networks before they could deliver TV-quality pictures into every American 's home .
