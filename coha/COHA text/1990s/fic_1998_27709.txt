DOG DAYS The man in the dog suit whines outside the door . " Again ? " sighs my mother . " Where 's my gun ? " says my dad . " We 'll take care of it this time , " my older brothers say . They go outside . We hear the shouts and the scuffle , and whimpers as he crawls away up the street . My brothers come back in . " That takes care of that , " they say , rubbing their hands together . " Damn nutcase , " my dad growls . But the next day he is back . His dog suit is shabby . The zipper 's gone ; the front 's held together with safety pins . He looks like a mutt . His tongue is flat and pink like a slice of bologna . He pants at me . " Mom , " I call , " he 's back . " My mother sighs , then comes to the door and looks at him . He cocks his head at her . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother says . " He looks sad . " I say , " He smells . " " No collar , " says my mother . " He must be a stray . " " Mother , " I say . " He 's a man in a dog suit . " He sits up and begs . My mother does n't look at me . She reaches out and strokes the man 's head . He blinks at her longingly . " Go get a plate , " she tells me . " See what you can dig out of the garbage . " " Dad 's going to be mad , " I say . " Just do it , " she says . So I do it , because I have no excuses , there 's nothing left to do , no school , no nothing . No place to go . People do n't leave their houses . They sit and peer out the windows and wait . Outside it 's perfectly quiet , no crickets , no katydids . I go back to the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I watch as he buries his face in the dirty scraps . He licks the plate clean and looks up at us . " Good dog , " my mother says . " He 's a man , " I say . " Some retard-weirdo . " He leans against my mother 's leg . My mother does n't even look at me . " Not a word to your father , Lisa , " she says , and she goes inside and slams the door . I sit down on the stoop . The man sits next to me . He smells dirty and sweet , like garbage on a hot day . His eyes are big and brown . His face is lost in tangled hair . He scratches himself . I sit there and breathe his smell and wonder if he has fleas . Finally I reach out and touch his head . The fur is matted and stiff . I touch a ragged ear , then give it a yank . He does n't even blink . Of course . It 's not his real ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his eyes sort of melt and blur on me the way a dog 's eyes will when he 's happy . Then I stop and give him a shove , then a kick , then I chase him away so my father wo n't find him when he comes home from hunting . It is so deathly quiet . I can hear him panting , his four-legged scamper scuttling on the sidewalk for a long time . * * * Last February was when things started happening . The plant closed . That meant my dad was out of work and sulking around the house all day . He 'd sit and drink in front of the TV , his face big and red and his eyes all tiny from the drinking . He 'd sit all scrunched up in the chair , his big head right on his shoulders like he had no neck at all . He 'd watch the morning news , the news at noon , the evening news . " Are n't you going to look for another job ? " my mother would ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " What 's the use ? " Then March came . Some of the stores in town closed up , and the movie place , and two of the gas stations . No new stock coming in , they said . The government needs supplies , they said . Gasoline shortage . You understand . April : My school closed early for summer vacation . So did the high school my brothers , Eliott and Pat , went to . For a while they enjoyed it . Then they got bored and tried to find summer jobs . But no one was hiring . Later even more stores closed up , and restaurants . Downtown began to look like a ghost town . For a while Eliott and Pat and their friends liked to drive around at night , smashing windows and things . Then gasoline ran out . My friend Marjorie lived two and a half blocks away and I went there . Marjorie had two long ponytails and always thought of things to do . She taught me to hang by my knees , and how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we drew faces on our stomachs and made them talk to each other and kiss . Then came June . The electricity went . No air-conditioning , and it was just beginning to get hot . We missed the TV . We still sat around it sometimes and stared at it like it might all of a sudden come to life . Then one night Dad got angry and kicked the glass screen in . Now he sits and reads the paper -- every word of it , even the ads . It 's all because of the war , they say . Roads are closed off . For government use only . And the power -- they say the government shut it off so the enemy ca n't trace it with their radars and bomb us . I think the government 's hoarding it for themselves ; they 're all holed up in Washington watching TV , one giant slumber party . There 's nothing to do ; it 's deathly quiet . No cars running since the gasoline ran out . People stay in their houses now . Nobody goes out . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their windows , from behind curtains , all up and down the street . Everyone sits and waits . That 's the worst of it , sitting and waiting . For what ? The attack ? Should we look at the sky ? Should we look down the road ? Dad keeps the news in the paper to himself . The government delivers the paper , once a week . Dad says you ca n't believe a word of it anyway . But still he reads it and chews his lip . I have nothing to do because Marjorie is gone . Her family went to stay with her grandmother who lives in the city . They left in June , just before the roads closed . These days my dad says I should stay near the house , but when he is away , I walk over to Marjorie 's old house and just look at it . I 'm afraid to hang by my knees without her . I might fall on my head . The worst of it is the animals . Sometime in July , they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it really , until they 're gone . Then the silence . No birds singing . No squirrels doing acrobatics in the trees or knocking in the attic . Even the crickets -- gone . The pets have disappeared . My mother 's cat , Polka Dot , wandered off long ago . She cried about it for days . Pets that could n't get out died in their cages . My pet goldfish , belly-up in the bowl . Are they all dead , all those missing animals ? Or did they all go somewhere else , a great exodus in the middle of the night ? The flock , the pack , the herd , the horde of them . Two by two down the road ? To somewhere safe ? We 'll never know . " Rats deserting a sinking ship , " says my dad . " They know something we do n't know . " So we wait and watch the skies , watch the roads , watch the ground -- who knows , they could tunnel straight through the earth and surprise us that way , where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything these days , my father says . I picture technology as a big transformer robot crushing cities , slicing the sky . Germ warfare , Dad warns us . When I drink water , I try to filter it through my teeth , screen out the germs . Surely they are big germs , heavily armed . We try to hold our breath . I think radiation , when it comes , will rain down glowing like the juice inside neon signs . No one seems to know who we 're fighting . Pat says it could be anyone . America has been number one for too long , and now all the little countries are ganging up on us . Anyone could be an enemy . Your next-door neighbor could be a spy . Pat says , " Your own sister could be a spy , even . " " Am not , " I say , and hit him in the gut . " I was just kidding , sport , " he says , and whacks me a hard one . Pat has straight greasy brown hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a haircut for a long time . Eliott does n't like to talk about who we 're fighting . He is almost old enough to get drafted . My dad says they have n't started drafting people yet , but they may , soon . He keeps telling Eliott to walk around barefoot all the time , so then maybe he 'll develop flat feet and they wo n't want him in the army . I ca n't tell anymore when my dad is kidding . His eyes are always shiny . He watches us all without blinking . My mother says he has begun to grind his teeth in his sleep , keeping her up all night . In August the beggars started coming around . My mom calls them unfortunates ; my dad calls them bums . They do n't have anywhere to live ; they do n't get government rations . They came wandering from I do n't know where . First they came around asking for work , a night in the garage . Now they ask for food , scraps , even a glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they come by . All they seem to want is the human interaction -- a little attention , some eye contact , conversation . Even when you yell at them , they seem to like it . This one is the dog suit is a new thing . He comes back again the day after we feed him that first time . It is almost nice to see an animal again , even if it 's not a real one . He 's well trained . He sits up and begs . My mother puts a morsel in his mouth . He rolls over . " How adorable , " says my mother . " He 's trying to look up your skirt , " I say . " You 'd better look out ; he 's some nut , " says Pat . " Some crazy . Some loony who has n't seen tail in a long time . Yeah , and I do n't mean a dog tail , either . " My mother turns around and stares at him . " Where did you learn to speak like that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without answering . I could tell her where Pat learns things . Pat and Eliott spend their nights sitting in the basement reading old Playboys by the light of the moon . There 's a curfew now at night , so everybody has to be home , inside , before dark . Army trucks patrol the streets . My mother strokes the man 's head for a moment . Then she goes back inside . She finds things to do -- she cleans the house ; she keeps busy . We have n't gotten mail for months , but she still checks the mailbox . There 's nothing to do , but still she bustles around all day , stays on her feet , is exhausted by evening . My dad reads the paper every day , then goes out with his gun . He 's looking for anything : a pigeon , a rabbit , a squirrel , someone 's pet chicken . There 's nothing out there . Pat and Eliott keep to themselves . They do n't talk to me . They wear the same clothes , day after day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a friend for some joints . I heard them talking about it . Now they wear the same sour-smelling jeans and T-shirts . When I go down to the basement , they chase me out . That is why I sit there on the stoop after my mother goes back inside . I sit next to the man in the dog suit . I tell him things . He cocks his head at me like he 's listening , but he does n't really understand -- which is okay . I stroke his head . It is a hot day . His nose is shiny with sweat . He pants . It must be hot in the dog suit . He smells worse than before . His teeth are yellow and his gums are black . After a while I push him away . He looks back at me , wiggling his stump of tail . I chase him away again . He crawls off , whining and sobbing . I go inside and find my mother straightening up closets . " Why does he do that , Mom ? Why does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " My mother sighs and sits back on her heels . " If he thinks he 's a dog , why ca n't we let him think that ? If that 's what he wants , is it so hard for us to go along with it ? It 's the polite thing to do , do n't you think ? " " I guess , " I say , though it does n't seem polite to me , exactly . " If he thinks he 's a dog , then he is a dog , " my mother says , in a way that means , That 's final . " Okay , " I say . Then I look down and see what she 's doing . She 's sweeping out little dried carcasses from the back of the closet . Dead beetles or roaches or something . Dozens of them , curled up and hollow , legs in the air . Now it is September . Now the man in the dog suit comes to our house every day . My mother feeds him bits and crumbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him things . He is a good listener . I show him the bruise Pat gave me the day before , pushing me out of the basement . They do n't want me down there , but sometimes I sit at the top of the stairs and listen to their voices . I tell the man in the dog suit all this , and also about the limp dark hairs on Eliott 's upper lip . And about the dark cloud that always settles in the room where my father is . I tell him about Rick Dees , my favorite DJ on the radio , before the power went out . Rick Dees , I tell him , has a slick , handsome voice and he must be a slick , handsome man , with sunglasses and movie-star eyes . The man in the dog suit nods . I decide to give him a name . Prince . I tell my mother and she says , " Good . That 's a good name for a dog . " Then the day comes when my father comes home too early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother and me stroking his back . " What 's this ? " says Dad , his face going darker than ever . He 's got his gun pointed at Prince , at us . His shirt is unbuttoned , so I can see the tuft of fur peeking out . Prince freezes . " Oh , Howard , " says my mother , " he 's not hurting anything . Really . " " What 's that you 're giving him ? " Dad says . " Just trash , " my mother says . " He 's helping me clean up . " " He 's dangerous . He could hurt you , " says my dad , aiming with the gun . " He keeps the other beggars away , " says my mother . This is true . Since Prince started coming , the other beggars have avoided our house . " Like a guard dog , " I say . My dad looks at us , squinting , like he 's aiming . " Howard , let him stay . He 's not doing any harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I say . And Dad -- I do n't know why -- cocks his head and says okay and stomps into the house . A moment later he calls to my mother to find him something to eat . I sit on the stoop with Prince . We listen and wait . We watch the sky . October now . We 're still holding our breath , waiting . Nothing happens . It is still hot . Nobody tells us anything : how the war 's going , or when school will start , or how many people are dead . I think the war is getting bigger , coming closer . No one has told me this , but I can feel the waiting , the tension buzzing in the air around my head like a homes . I think people are moving away . I do n't see our neighbors peering from behind their curtains anymore . " They 're dead , " says Pat , " The government comes with trucks and clears them out in the middle of the night , when we 're asleep . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard with Prince . I throw the ball . He chases it , brings it back to me in his mouth . My dad , watching us , says , " He 's not a dog , he 's a man , for God 's sake . Treat him like a man . " But we ignore him . I throw , Prince fetches . We are having an all ' American good time , just like Dick and Jane and Spot in the reader . After my dad leaves , I sing all of Rick Dees 's favorite songs for Prince . Prince likes that . He barks with me . I tell Prince all kinds of things . I know he wo n't laugh , like Eliott , or punch me , like Pat does . He presses against me , all warm and furry . He would never hurt me . I am taller than he is anyway . His face is so kind : warm , wet , blank eyes . I have little pink bumps on my legs . Fleabites , I think , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever hurts you , tell me right away , " says my dad . Prince would never hurt me . My dad thinks everybody thinks like him . One day I see my dad in the yard , talking to Prince . " You 're a human being , for God 's sake . Stand up like a man . Listen to me ! Take off that Halloween costume shit . I 'll give you my own clothes if you 'll take it off and stand up like a man and talk to me . I know you can talk . Come here , you . " And he grabs for the dog suit , tries to pull it off . Prince runs away . One night Eliott says , " Well , you know what they say . Man 's best friend . " Pat says , " Do n't let him touch you . You want to end up with a litter of puppies ? " He and Eliott snigger and lean in together , their faces all twisted . Pat 's face is rotten with pimples . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they are getting worse and worse . Sometimes at night I creep downstairs and out on the porch , and Prince is there sleeping or waiting . I curl up beside him and bury my face in the rough , sick-smelling fur . Prince gives my hand a lick . That is his way of saying good night . November : The army trucks , with their ration packages and bottles of water , stop coming . The sky is a curdled yellow color . It seems like most of our neighbors have gone on vacation , or died or disappeared or moved away , or something . We seem to be losing . The silence is deafening . In December Eliott and Pat break into some houses at night , looking for food . An army patrol brings them back . If they do something like this again , they will be taken away for good . " Taken away where ? " I say . No one will tell me . My father has a dark look all the time now , as if a black mildew is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be so bad , to get out of this shithole , " says Pat . But he and Eliott stay in at night . There is nothing to eat . My mother has scoured the house . She tries making us a salad of grass and things . It makes me throw up . I find a bottle of Flintstones chewable vitamins in the back of my drawer . I do n't want to share . I eat a whole handful and it gives me a horrible stomachache . My legs are nice and thin now . And my bones stick out of my face in a nice way . I look like the models in the magazines . I know this because I spend a lot of time in my room now , looking in the mirror . I do n't want to be with my parents , or Pat or Eliott , so I sit with the mirror to keep me company . The mirror behaves . We have conversations . Sometimes if I squint really hard into the mirror , I can see Marjorie there , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been writing things down in my diary , month after month . I 'm beginning to lose track of the days . They all run together . I remember when every day was different : Monday was music day at school ; Wednesday I had piano lessons ; Friday I went to Marjorie 's house . Now they are all the same . Sometimes I look in my closet and it surprises me to see all the clothes hanging there . Now I always wear the same shirt , and some pants all bunched up with a belt . There 's no reason to change . I remember my mother used to yell at me to put on clean underpants every day . Now they are all dirty and she is too tired to yell . Every day I go downstairs and sit on the porch . Prince is still curled up there , shivering in the cold . My dad wo n't let him in the house . And Prince wo n't leave , even though we ca n't feed him anymore . He loves me . I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sing to him . His fur is loose and baggy on him . I tell him secrets . Sometimes I pretend he is Rick Dees and we are on a fashionable date in his fancy car . Prince plays along , though he does n't really understand . Rick Dees and I have a romantic dinner at a fancy restaurant . My mother stays in bed most of the time now . She asks that we not disturb her . Maybe she is imagining that she is somewhere else , someone else . But who else would she want to be ? She 's my mother , she ca n't be anything else . My brothers stay in the basement . They are making plans down there , I think . They are stroking the magazine pictures , trying to pretend they are real . I know that by now the magazine pages must be all withered from their pawing . Looking at the fleshy naked women all day must make them hungrier . Only my dad still goes out , every day , with his gun . He walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes . He still seems to think there is something out there , something to put in the pot . There 's nothing left . There has n't been for months . But he refuses to believe it . Then suddenly it gets colder . Is it because of the war , because of a bomb ? I wonder . Or is it just a very cold December ? My mother comes downstairs , my brothers come upstairs , and we all settle in the living room . The bedrooms and the basement are too cold . It is warmer with all of us together , and the living room is better insulated . We hardly speak to one another . My brothers seem to speak by looks : They snicker suddenly , together , at nothing . And my parents speak with stares and shrugs . Me , I do n't look at anybody ; I stay in my comer with my winter coat and my blanket . Two of my teeth are loose . They should n't be . I still spend a few hours a day with Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curled up against the side of the house , trying to steal some of the warmth . Once in a while he crawls around the yard , trying to warm himself up . I 'm too tired these days to sing . Just opening my mouth gives me a headache . Prince understands . He is the only one who understands me . Then one day I come in from the porch . It 's starting to get dark so early , now that it 's winter . I go into the living room and it 's all in shadow . I ca n't see anyone 's face clearly ; all I see are their teeth shining . It is so quiet . Then I hear their breathing , each one of them separately , like singers not in harmony . They are all waiting for something . " I wish I had a steak , " says Eliott , his voice strained and high . A pause . " In Africa they eat grubs and things . Maybe there are worms in the backyard , " says Pat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dandelion salad . " says Eliott . Pat says , " I heard in Korea people eat dogs . " No one says anything . I can see the room get darker . Then my dad stands up . " What are you doing ? " my mother says . He does n't answer . " Where are you going ? Howard -- don't -- don't --  " My dad is reaching for his gun . My brothers stand up . " What are you doing ? How can you even think of --  " They are walking slowly to the door . " He 's a man , Howard ! A man ! You can't- " my mother screams . " He 's a dog , " says my dad . " He 's an animal . " And then I see the door swing open , see Prince lift his head expectantly . I see my dad lift the gun and aim . I 'm trying to get over there ; I ca n't get there fast enough -- the air is too thick . They 're framed in the doorway , my dad and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing the whites of his eyes , wind ruffling the fur on his head . Then he 's running , galloping on all fours across the yard , his tongue hanging out like a pink streamer . A shot rings out , echoing in the silence , but it misses him . He keeps running , and then he 's up , up on his hind legs , lurching away two-footedly , front legs pawing the air , and then another shot rings out , shaking the world , and he 's down , down , splayed out on our front lawn , nose in the dirt , tail in the air , wind whipping his fur around , his legs quivering , then still . I try to go to him , but it 's too late . My dad and Eliott and Pat beat me to him . They run across the lawn , the pack of them , and fall upon him snarling .
