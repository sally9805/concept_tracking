Electronic images of the sky are appearing in the pages of ASTRONOMY in ever increasing numbers . Such imaging , which uses a CCD chip and digital storage rather than conventional photographic film , permits storing and manipulating data in the images with ease and shortens the exposure times needed for capturing faint objects . The technique works well for normal , " stationary " sky objects : galaxies , clusters , and nebulae . Electronic imaging , however , had n't worked well with comets . The problem is that comets move at a different rate and in different directions across the sky than the stars used for guiding an exposure . Comets are usually faint , so they require fairly long exposures even with electronic imaging . To shoot comets in color , you need to take three exposures  --  red , green , and blue  --  in fairly rapid succession so the comet lies in essentially the same starfield and you get a satisfying result when combining the frames into a single image . These factors conspire to make imaging comets with a CCD camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also move relative to the star background . Over the past several months , however , we have developed a process that minimizes the trouble of recording comets with a CCD camera while maximizing the results . The chief dilemma with comets results from their motion . If you do the conventional thing and guide on a star near the comet , you 'll get pinpoint stars but details in the comet will smear out over the length of an exposure . We first encountered this when we used John 's 16-inch f/4.5 reflector and an SBIG ST-6 CCD camera to record Comet Mueller ( 1993a ) . We got a sharp starfield and a blurred image of Comet Mueller . The best way to get around this in comet photography is called step-guiding . The method seeks to estimate the angle and speed of motion of the comet with respect to the background starfield and then guide the telescope to compensate for this apparent motion . Step-guiding produces a sharp , detailed image of the comet with trailed stars , and can also be used in recording comets with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the so-called track-and-accumulate mode of the ST-6 camera , we first take a short exposure ( typically 30 seconds ) of the comet 's field . From this exposure , we choose a guidestar on the computer display . We then take a long series of very short exposures one right after the other . We combine the images using the guide star as a registration point from one image to the next . This helps to compensate for inaccuracies in polar alignment and periodic error in the telescope 's drive system . The final result is an image nearly equivalent to a single long exposure . Then the process takes another evolutionary step . By combining frames and using the track-and-accumulate mode but tracking and registering on the core of the comet , we found we could produce striking tricolor images of Comet Mueller ( see page 72 ) . This not only provides a deep , detailed image of the comet with relative ease , but preserves the maximum amount of detail in the comet itself and shows the object in striking color . We feel the technique will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaging . We have used this technique to image a number of comets , including comets Kushida ( 1994a ) , P/Schwassman-Wachmann 2 , P/Shoemaker-Levy 9 ( 1993e ) , P/Tempel 1 ( 1993c ) , McNaught-Russell ( 1993v ) , **27;641;TOOLONG ( 1994m ) , and P/Machholz 2 ( 1994o ) . Obtaining the CCD image is only step one , however . The real fun comes with image processing , using the computer as darkroom . We have been using Sehgal Corp . ' s Hidden Image program to try to bring out as much detail as possible in the comae and tails of the comets . The program employs a background star in the field to estimate the blurring and atmospheric effects in the image and to remove the smearing and sharpen the image . The technique is essentially the same as that used to help the fuzzy images delivered by the Hubble Space Telescope before its fix . However , with our comet images we track on the comet and therefore trail the stars . That 's where the preliminary 30-second exposure of the starfield comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a star in the field of the comet to use with Hidden Image . We extract a relatively bright star from this original image and save it in the computer so Hidden Image can use its " point-spread function " to derive parameters for sharpening the image , what astro-imagers call deconvolving it . The technique works quite well with comets . The combination of the track-and-accumulate mode of the ST-6 and the Hidden Image program opens a new world for comet imaging . A similar method could be used with CCD cameras without a track-and-accumulate mode . This could be done by taking a number of short exposures ( 30 to 60 seconds ) and combining them , with the comet 's nucleus serving as the registration point . Either way , sharper , clearer pictures of comets will show up in the pages of ASTRONOMY 'S future issues . Glenn Gombert and John Chumack enthusiastically image the sky using a variety of telescopes at John Bryan State Park outside Dayton , Ohio . <p>                @ @ @ @ @
