The only stench of a two-stroke exhaust has been long considered an unavoidable part of life on the water for outboard owners , especially those who 've spent time trolling with a tailwind . But " Old Smoky 's " days are numbered , as new environmental regulations intended to reduce the exhaust emissions from marine engines are phased in over the next decade . In fact , the first example of a new , cleaner-burning breed of outboard are already on the market  --  outboards with four-stroke powerheads that not only reduce exhaust emissions but can claim up to 30 percent better fuel economy than a two-stroke of equal power . Experts predict that compact to mid-range four-stroke outboards ( up to about 100 hp ) will gradually replace the traditional two-stroke powerhead as marine engine manufacturers find ways to cut hydrocarbon ( HC ) emissions ( essentially unburned fuel and oil ) by 75 percent over nine years , beginning with the 1998 model year . Current two-strokes are big HC offenders because the incoming charge of fresh fuel/air mixture displaces , or " scavenges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some unburned fuel follows the exhaust out of the engine  --  as much as 40 percent escapes unburned at low rpm , which accounts for the way an outboard smokes and shakes at low speeds and why its exhaust is so pungent . It is literally misfiring : The mixture is often so rich at idle that the spark plugs may ignite the fuel charge only 50 percent of the time . A four-stroke engine uses moving valves to seal the combustion chamber and should produce significantly less HC and get better fuel economy than a two-stroke . The four-stroke outboard is not a new idea . Homelite manufactured them in the 1950s , and Honda has offered small displacement four-stroke for more than 25 years . But those motors were heavy , expensive , and limited in power . In 1990 , when Honda introduced a 35/45-hp model that weighed about the same as a two-stroke and offered similar performance with smooth operation and excellent fuel economy , a lot of people reconsidered the four-stroke  --  particularly in light of the EPA-mandated restrictions . This season both Mercury Marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its 45 up to SO hp to keep pace . How good are these new engines ? The best way to find out is a head-to-head comparison of all the four-strokes with a representative two-stroke . The Honda BF50 has a three-cylinder , 808cc powerhead with a single overhead camshaft . The Mariner 50 ( also offered in black with its logo reading Mercury 50 ) and the Yamaha F-50 share a four-cylinder , overhead cam , 935cc powerhead , the result of a joint engineering and manufacturing venture between Yamaha Motors and Mercury Marine . Mercury builds the short block , Yamaha the cylinder head , fuel system , and electrical components . Each company then swaps components and assembles the complete powerhead in its own facility ( the Mercury/Mariner in Wisconsin , the Yamaha in Japan ) . Below this common powerhead , each company installs its own exhaust system , gearcase , and transom bracket , so they are really different motors . To set the baseline and carry the flag for the two-stroke forces , we chose a Mercury 50 , which has a three-cylinder , 849cc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system  --  the Honda and Mariner hold about two quarts of lube , the Yamaha three quarts . The oil and filter should be changed every 100 hours or annually . Each motor has a drain port in the midsection  --  Honda 's even has a plastic cap that doubles as a funnel  --  or the dirty oil can be siphoned out of the dipstick tube . Either way , an annual oil change is less trouble and less mess than fiddling with a two-stroke oil reservoir , and it certainly beats premixing two-stroke fuel , as must be done with older motors . Because four-strokes have a lot more parts  --  most of which have to do with their far more complex valvetrain  --  they require some maintenance not associated with a two-stroke . Each has a toothed rubber timing belt with an idler wheel to maintain its tension . The belt , which lies under a plastic shield , must be inspected occasionally ( but it is designed to last at least 10 seasons ) . Each motor also has a screw-type valve-lash adjustment , which should be checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Honda dealer every 200 hours . With the cowl removed from each four-stroke , it 's easy to locate a dipstick , oil-fill cap , and small , spin-on oil filter . Other maintenance , including an annual gear-lube change , is the same as for a two-stroke . Modern casting techniques and the use of lightweight composites for parts like the valve cover and midsection housing have significantly reduced the weight of this latest generation of four-strokes . The Honda weighs 203 pounds , the Mariner 215 , and the Yamaha 212 , which all compare favorably with 207 pounds for the two-stroke Mercury 50 . ( Other two-stroke 50s range in weight from a Yamaha 50 at 172 pounds to an Evinrude 50 at 250 pounds . ) The four-strokes also come equipped with all of the features associated with current two-stroke outboards in this range , including power trim and tilt , electric starting , and a choice of tiller or remote controls . Each has a warning system for engine overheat or low oil pressure . The Honda and Mariner have a fitting for freshwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 20-or 25-inch transoms. the Mariner and Yamaha only in the 20-inch size . The Yamaha and Mariner have an automatic enrichment circuit that replaces a choke and provides reliable starts in cold weather . The Mariner uses a gearcase designed for the 30/40-hp two-stroke ; therefore it accepts the wide range of aluminum and stainless-steel props made for motors of that size . Yamaha and Honda offer a more limited choice of propellers . The boat used for our evaluation was a Lund Pro-V 1660 set up for a tiller-steer outboard , a classic example of the aluminum fishing boat popular with back-trolling walleye and muskie anglers in the upper Midwest . This Lund is rated for up to 60 hp and has a dry weight of 830 pounds . We filled the 20-gallon fuel tank and the 20-gallon live well , and to simulate a real-world collection of gear and tackle , placed three 50-pound shot bags on the deck . All the motors share the same transom-bracket hole pattern , so ( with the help of a chain hoist ) it was a simple operation to swap motors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of overall performance , these motors proved to be surprisingly close  --  surprising because we expected the Mercury two-stroke to have an advantage in speed and acceleration . Instead , it was a dead heat across the board ( see table ) . ( Table omitted ) The Honda , Yamaha , and Mercury each recorded a radar-measured top speed of about 32 mph , with the Mariner checking in at 31 . In a 0-20 mph acceleration test , the Honda tied the Mercury two-stroke with a time of 7.2 seconds , while the Yamaha and Mariner were about a half-second slower . We measured fuel economy across each motor 's rpm range and found that each achieved its maximum economy at 4,500 rpm . At this cruising speed , the Honda was the clear economy champ at 9.4 miles per gallon ( at 20.7 mph ) , 32 percent better than the two-stroke Mercury , which managed 6.4 mpg at the same 4,500 rpm but at a speed of 27 mph . The Yamaha and Mariner were less efficient than the Honda ( see table ) but were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 6,100 rpm ) , the Honda 's efficiency dipped to 8.2 mpg , but it nevertheless maintained its 32 percent advantage over the two-stroke . The Mariner and Yamaha lost some ground to the two-stroke as speed increased . All of these engines started easily hot or cold . At idle , the four-strokes purred like sewing machines , although the Honda , which idled at 840 rpm , was noticeably smoother than the Yamaha and Mariner , which idled at about 600 rpm . We measured the sound level of each motor at idle , and levels ranged from 59 decibels for the Mariner to 62 decibels for the Honda  --  but those figures may be deceptive . At idle these motors were so quiet that the loudest noise coming from the transom of the Lund was the tinkling of the cooling-system telltale into the lake . The two-stroke was coarse by comparison . It shook at idle and vibrated its tiller handle even though the engine was well isolated from the boat . While the motor 's sound level at idle was about the same as that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaust was obviously richer with unburned fuel than that of the four-strokes . For all-day trolling comfort , the four-strokes are our clear choice . Finally there is the matter of price . A four-stroke is a vastly more complex machine than a two-stroke , and that fact is reflected in its cost . The two-stroke Mercury 50 we tested is competitively priced in its range , listing at $5,631 ( including a one-year mechanical and three-year corrosion warranty , though the prop , instruments , and fuel tank are extra ) . The Honda BF50 is the lowest-price four-stroke , with a suggested retail price of $6,200 ( including a two-year warranty , aluminum propeller , tachometer with warning lights , trim gauge , and six-gallon fuel tank ) . When the value of the Honda prop , instruments , and warranty are figured into its price , it really is n't much more expensive than the two-stroke Mercury . The Yamaha F-50 is priced at $6,840 ( including a two-year warranty , tach with warning lights , trim gauge , and six-gallon fuel tank , but no prop ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $6,943 ( with a one-year mechanical and three-year corrosion warranty and a 3.2-gallon fuel tank but no prop or instruments ) . In the face of dire predictions of " EPA outboards " offering sluggish performance at stupendous prices , the new four-stroke 50s from Honda , Mercury Marine , and Yamaha prove that we can enjoy the benefits of a cleaner environment , and a more peaceful boating experience , without undue sacrifice . <p>
