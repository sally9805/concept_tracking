It was the coldest winter in memory . For the first time since 1962 the Lake of Zurich threatened a solid freeze . Already a shelf of blue ice clung to her shores . Farther out a transparent crust floated upon the surface . The stately paddle wheel steamships that called regularly on Zurich and her prosperous environs had taken refuge at their winter harbor in Kilchberg . At ports around the lake storm lamps burned red : danger , conditions hazardous . The last snow had fallen only two days before , yet the city 's roads were immaculate . Muddy piles of frozen slush that might sully the sidewalks of other urban centers had been removed . Recalcitrant patches of ice likewise . Even the rock salt and gravel spread to hasten their decomposition had been neatly swept up . In any other year , the continuing bout of record low temperatures and unending snowfall would be reason for spirited discussion . Many a newspaper column would be devoted to a thorough tallying of the economic gains and losses to the country . To her agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death in low-lying barns ; to her many Alpine ski resorts -- all winners , and about time , after consecutive seasons of insufficient snowfall ; and to her precious water table -- also a winner , as experts forecast a restoration of the national aquifer after a decade of depletion . More conservative rags might even include a spiteful article pronouncing the much-feared " greenhouse effect " dead and buried . But not this year . On this first Monday in January , no mention of the severe weather could be found anywhere on the front pages of the Neue Zurcher Zeitung , the Tages Anzeiger , or even the chronically mundane Zurcher Tagblatt . The country was struggling with something far rarer than a harsh winter : a crisis of conscience . Signs of turmoil were not difficult to find . And Nicholas Neumann , stepping off the number thirteen tram at the Paradeplatz , immediately spotted the most prominent of them . Fifty yards ahead , along the east side of the Bahnhofstrasse , a band of men and women were gathered in front of a drab four-story building that was home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held signs , which Nick , as he preferred to be called , could read even at this distance : " Clean Up the Swiss Laundry . " " Drug Money Is Blood Money . " " Hitler 's Bankers . " Others stood with their hands shoved into their pockets , marching determinedly back and forth . The past year had witnessed a parade of embarrassing revelations about the country 's banks . Complicity in the wartime arms trade with the Third Reich ; hoarding of funds belonging to survivors of Hitler 's death camps ; and the concealment of illicit profits deposited by the South American drug cartels . The local press had branded the banks " soulless instruments of financial chicanery " and " willing conspirators to the drug barons ' deadly trade . " The public had taken note . And now those accountable must be made to pay . Worse storms had raged and passed , mused Nick , as he set off toward the bank . He did n't share in the country 's self-inculpatory mood . Nor was he sure the nation 's banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his interest went . His concern was focused elsewhere that morning : on a private matter that had haunted the darkest corners of his heart for as long as he could remember . Nick moved easily through the crowd . He had broad shoulders and stood just over six feet tall . His step was confident and purposeful and , except for a faint limp , commanding . Veterans of the parade ground would note the curled hand laid along the rail of the trousers , the shoulders pushed back a breath more than was comfortable , and immediately recognize him as one of their own . His face was cast from a serious mold , framed by a crop of straight black hair . His nose was prominent and spoke of a distinct , if unlanded , European heritage . His chin was sturdy rather than stubborn . But it was his eyes that caught people 's attention . They were a pale blue and surrounded by a network of fine lines unexpected in someone his age . They offered a furtive challenge . His fiancee said once that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , someone wearier than a twenty-eight-year-old had any right to be . Someone she no longer knew . She 'd left him the next day . Nick quickly covered the short distance to the bank . A freezing drizzle had begun to fall , whipped up by a stiff lake breeze . Flakes of snow darkened his trench coat , but the foul weather did not intrude on his thoughts . Threading his way through the crowd of demonstrators , he kept his eyes fixed on the twin revolving doors that sat before him at the top of a broad flight of granite stairs . The United Swiss Bank . Forty years ago his father had begun his employ here . Apprentice at sixteen , portfolio manager at twenty-five , vice president at thirty-three , Alexander Neumann had been on the fast track to the top . Executive vice president . Board of directors . Anything was possible . And everything expected . Nick checked his wristwatch , then climbed the stairs and entered the lobby of the bank . Somewhere close by , a church bell tolled the hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneasy frisson of a mission at hand . He smiled inwardly , giving silent greeting to the once familiar sensation , then continued across the marble floor toward a lectern marked " Reception " in letters of gold relief . " I have an appointment with Mr. Cerruti , " he said to the hall porter . " I 'm to begin work today . " " Your papers ? " demanded the porter , an older man resplendent in a navy topcoat with braided silver epaulets . Nick passed across the counter an envelope bearing the bank 's embossed logo . The porter withdrew the letter of engagement and looked it over " Identification ? " Nick presented two passports : one navy blue with a golden eagle emblazoned on its cover , the other a bold red with a prim white cross painted upon its face . The porter examined both , then returned them . " I 'll announce your arrival . Take a seat , please . Over there . " He motioned toward a grouping of leather chairs . But Nick preferred to remain standing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elegantly dressed customers waiting for their favorite tellers and the gray executives hurrying across the shiny floor . He listened to the stubble of hushed conversations and the whisper of computer-assisted commerce . His thoughts drifted to the flight over from New York two nights earlier , and then back further , to Cambridge , to Quantico to California . He 'd been headed this way for years , without even knowing it . A telephone buzzed behind the porter 's lectern . The porter snapped the receiver to his ear and nodded crisply in time to his every grunted response . Moments later , Nick was being shown across the lobby to a bank of antiquated elevators . The porter walked ahead with perfectly measured strides as if determined to establish the exact distance to the waiting elevator , and once there , made a show of sweeping open its smoked glass door . " Second floor , " he said , in his clipped voice . " Someone will be waiting for you . " Nick thanked him and stepped into the elevator . It was small with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brass balustrade . Immediately , he caught scent of a medley of familiar fragrances : the blunt trail of stale cigar smoke ; the nasal pinch of well-polished shoes , and most distinctly , the bracing note , at once sweet and antiseptic , of Kolnisches Wasser , his father 's favorite eau de cologne . The masculine odors assaulted his senses , conjuring up a fractured image of his dad : wine black hair cropped unfashionably short ; unblinking blue eyes capped by unruly eyebrows ; stern mouth locked in a downcast expression of disapproval . The porter grew impatient . " You must go to the second floor . Second floor , ' " he said , this time in English . " You 're expected . Please , sir . " But Nick did not hear a word . His back remained to the open door , his eyes staring blindly ahead . He struggled to fit the separate images together , to bind them into a finished portrait . He recalled the powerful feelings of awe and pride and fear he 'd experienced when in his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomplete and somehow disjointed , wanting for some essential fabric that he did not possess . " Young man , are you all right ? " the porter asked . Nick spun to face him , banishing the disconcerting images from his mind . " I 'm fine , " he said . " Just fine . " The porter placed a foot into the elevator . " You 're sure you are ready to begin work today ? " Nick raised his chin and fought the porter 's inquisitive stare . " Yes , " he said gravely , giving an imperceptible nod of his head . " I 've been ready for a long time . " Offering an apologetic smile , he let the elevator door close and pressed the button for the second floor . " MARCO CERRUTI IS ILL . Out with some virus or bug , who knows what , " explained a tall , sandy-haired executive well on the downslope to forty , who was waiting for Nick on the second-floor landing . " Probably the lousy water in that part of the world -- Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's our territory . Believe it or not , we bankers did not give it that name . " Nick stepped out of the elevator and offering the required smile , introduced himself . " ' Course , you 're Neumann . Who else would I be waiting for ? " The sandy-haired man thrust out his hand and gave a vigorous shake . " I 'm Peter Sprecher . Do n't let the accent fool you . I 'm Swiss as William Tell . Did my schooling in England . Still know the words to God Save the Queen . ' " He pulled at an expensive cuff and winked . " Old man Cerruti is just back from his Christmas run . I call it his yearly Crusade : Cairo , Riyadh , Dubai , and then off to points unknown -- probably a sunny port where he can work on his tan while the rest of us back at head office wilt . Guess it did n't work out as planned . Word 's come down he 'll be out at least a week . The bad news is you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outpouring of information , doing his best to digest it all . " And the good news ? " But Peter Sprecher had disappeared down a narrow corridor . " Ah , yes , the good news , " he called over his shoulder . " Well , the good news is that there is a mountain of work to be done . We 're a bit shorthanded at the moment , so you wo n't be sitting on your duff reading a sackful of annual reports . We 're sending you out into the blue , pronto . " " Into the blue ? " Sprecher stopped at a closed door on the left-hand side of the hallway . " Clients , chum . We have to put somebody 's pretty mug in front of our trusting customers . You look like an honest type . Got all your teeth , do you ? Should be able to fool them . " " Today ? " Nick asked , ruffled . " No , not today , " Sprecher answered , grinning . " The bank usually likes to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month to learn the ropes . " He leaned on the handle and opened the door . He walked inside the small meeting room and tossed the manila envelope he 'd been carrying onto the conference table . " Take a seat , " he said , flinging himself into one of the quilted leather chairs . " Make yourself at home . " Nick pulled out a chair and sat across the table from his new boss . His momentary panic settled , giving way to the usual vague unease that accompanied his arrival at a new post . But he recognized a new sensation , too -- a stubborn disbelief that he was actually there . You 're in , Nick told himself in the admonishing tone that had belonged to his father . Keep your mouth closed and your ears open . Become one of them . Peter Sprecher pulled a sheaf of papers from the envelope . " Your life in four lines , single spaced . Says here you 're from Los Angeles . " " I grew up there , but I have n't called it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Gomorrah rolled into one . Love the place , myself . " Sprecher shook loose a Marlboro and offered the pack to Nick , who declined . " Did n't figure you for a tobacco fiend . You look fit enough to run a damned marathon . Some advice ? Calm down , boy . You 're in Switzerland . Slow and steady , that 's our motto . Remember that . " " I 'll keep it in mind . " " Liar , " Sprecher laughed . " I can see you 've got a bee buzzing about your bonnet . Sit too damn straight . That will be Cerruti 's problem , not mine . " He lowered his head and puffed on his cigarette while studying the new employee 's papers . " Marine , eh ? An officer . That explains it . " " Four years , " said Nick . He was trying hard to sit more casually -- drop a shoulder , maybe slouch a little . It was n't easy . " What d' ya do ? " " Infantry . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other half we floated around the Pacific waiting for a crisis to flare up so that we could put our training to use . We never did . " That was the company line , and he 'd been sworn to keep it . " Says here you worked in New York . Four months only . What happened ? " Nick kept his answer brief . When lying , he knew it best to stay within the shadow of the truth . " It was n't what I had expected . I did n't feel at home there , at work or in the city . " " So you decided to seek your fortune abroad ? " " I 've lived in the States my whole life . One day I realized that it was time for something new . Once I made the decision , I got out as quickly as I could . " " Wish I 'd had the guts to do something like that . Alas , for me it 's too late . " Sprecher exhaled a cloud of smoke toward the ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank ? " " To Switzerland . Someone in your family is Swiss , is n't he ? Hard to pick up a passport any other way . " " It 's been a long time , " said Nick , purposely keeping his answer oblique . Seventeen years , actually . He 'd been eleven , and his father had brought him inside this same building . It had been a social visit , the great Alex Neumann poking his head into the offices of his former colleagues , exchanging a few words before presenting little Nicholas as if he were an exotic trophy from a far-off land . " The passport comes from my father 's side . We spoke Swiss-German together at home . " " Did you ? How quaint . " Sprecher stubbed out his cigarette and brought his chair closer to the table so that he sat directly facing Nick . " Enough small talk , then . Welcome to the United Swiss Bank , Mr. Neumann . You 've been assigned to Finanz Kundenberatung , Abteilung 4 . Financial Client Management , section 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle East and southern Europe , that is Italy , Greece , and Turkey . Right now we handle approximately seven hundred accounts with assets totaling over two billion U.S. dollars . In the end that 's still the only currency worth a damn . " Most of our clients are individuals who hold numbered accounts with the bank . You might see their names penciled somewhere inside their files . Penciled , mind you . Erasable . They are to remain officially anonymous . We do n't keep permanent records regarding their identity in the office . That information is kept in DZ , Dokumentation Zentrale . Stalag 17 , we call it . " Sprecher wagged a long finger at Nick . " Several of our more important clients are known only to the top brass of the bank . Keep it that way . Any inclination you may have about getting to know them personally had better stop now . Understood ? " " Understood , " said Nick . The help does not mix with the guests . " Here 's the drill : A client will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know his cash balance or the value of the stocks in his portfolio . Before you give out any information , confirm his or her identity . All our clients have code words to identify themselves . Ask for it . Maybe ask their birthday on top of that . Makes them feel secure . But that 's as far as your curiosity runs . If a client wants to transfer fifty thousand deutsche marks a week to an account in Palermo , you say , Prego , Signore . Con gusto . ' If he insists on sending monthly cash wires to a dozen John Does at a dozen different banks in Washington , D.C. , you say , Of course , sir . It 's my pleasure . ' Where our clients ' money comes from and what they choose to do with it are entirely their own business . " Nick kept his wry comments to himself and concentrated on keeping straight all the information being tossed his way . Sprecher stood from his chair and walked to the window , which overlooked the Bahnhofstrasse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head toward the demonstrators who paraded in front of the bank . " No ? Get up and come over here . Look down there . " Nick rose and walked to Sprecher 's side , from where he could see the assembly of fifteen or twenty protesters . " Barbarians at the gate , " said Sprecher . " The natives are growing restless . " " There have been calls for greater disclosure of the bank 's activities in the past , " Nick said . " The search for assets belonging to customers killed during the Second War . The banks handled that problem . " " By using the nation 's gold reserves to set up a survivors ' fund . Cost us seven billion francs ! And still we stonewalled them over direct access to our records . The past is verboten . You can be sure of one thing : Swiss banks must be built of the hardest Bernadino granite , not of porous sandstone . " Sprecher glanced at his watch , then dismissed the demonstrators with a wave . " Now more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we 're told . Granite , Neumann . Anyway , that 's enough of Saint Peter 's pap for now . You 're to go to Dr. Schon at personnel to have an identification card made up , get a handbook , and take care of all the other niceties that make our beloved institution such a wonderful place to work . Rules , Mr. Neumann . Rules . " Nick leaned forward , listening carefully while directions to the personnel director 's office were given . Rules , he repeated to himself . The admonition sent him back to his first day at Officer Candidate School . The voices here were softer and the barracks nicer , but all in all it was the same . New organization , new rules , and no room to mess up . " And one last thing , " said Sprecher . " Dr. Schon can be a little testy sometimes . Americans are not a favorite topic . The less said the better . " FROM HIS WINDOW on the Fourth Floor , Wolfgang Kaiser stared down upon the damp heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forty years he had worked at the United Swiss Bank , the last seventeen as chairman . In that time , he could recall only one other demonstration taking place on the steps of the bank -- a protest against the bank 's investments in South Africa . He had frowned on the practice of apartheid as much as the next man , but politics simply did n't factor into a business decision . As a rule , Afrikaners were damned good clients . Paid back their loans on time . Kept a decent amount on deposit . Lord knows they held gold bars up to their eyeballs . Kaiser gave each end of his mustache a brief tug and moved away from the window . Though of medium height , he was a formidable man . Clothed , as was his custom , in bespoke navy worsted , he could be mistaken only for Lord of the Manor . But his broad shoulders , plowman 's back , and stout legs testified to a common upbringing . And of his less than noble parentage he carried a permanent reminder : his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drunken midwife , was thin and limp , a paralyzed appendage . Despite constant exercise during his early years , the arm had remained atrophied and would always be two inches shorter than the right . Kaiser circled his desk , staring at the telephone . He was waiting for a call . A brief message that would bring the past into the present . Word that the circle was closing . He could not expel from his mind the message written on one of the crude placards below . " Child Killers , " it read . He did n't know what exactly it made reference to , but still the words stung . Damned press ! Vultures were thrilled to have such an easy target . The evil bankers so eager to accommodate the world 's baddies . Horseshit ! If not us , then somebody else . Austria , Luxembourg , the Cayman Islands . The competition was closing in . The phone on his desk buzzed , He pounced on it in three swift steps . " Kaiser . " " Guten Morgen , Herr Direktor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boy has arrived , " said the hall porter . " He came in at nine o'clock sharp . " " And how is he ? " Kaiser had seen photographs of him over the years . More recently , he had viewed a videotape of the boy 's interview . Still , he could not stop himself from asking , " Does he look like his father ? " " A few pounds heavier , perhaps . Otherwise , a spitting image . I sent him to Mr. Sprecher . " " Yes , I 've been informed . Thank you , Hugo . " Kaiser hung up the phone and took a seat behind his desk . He turned his thoughts to the young man sitting two floors below him , and soon a faint smile pushed up the corners of his mouth . " Welcome to Switzerland , Nicholas Alexander Neumann , " he whispered . " It 's been so long since we last met . So very , very long . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
