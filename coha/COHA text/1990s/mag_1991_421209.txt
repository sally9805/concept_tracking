Efforts to " energize with exercise " have won Stark County , Ohio , top honors and Suzanne Timken a top-job with the President 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports . <p> The qualifying rules are simple enough : if you can walk a half mile or swim a single lap , you can make the team . All others are invited to get in the game by exercising their lungs with cheers for the nearly 15,000 amateur athletes on the court , in the pool , around the track , and at the starting line . <p> Miracles happen every September in Stark County , Ohio . Onlookers recall the 86-year-old man who loped across the finish of the three-mile race ; the middle-aged nurse , frightened of the water , who received a standing ovation when she came in last in the swim relay ; and members of a tug of war team who spent three months dragging 5,000-pound blocks around a parking lot as part of their training regimen . When the blocks became boring , they turned to trucks . <p> Now in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition , the country 's largest amateur sports event , has served as a model for nearly 70 cities determined to " shape up " their residents . " It 's unbelievable , " says John Usmial. the coordinator of Cup activities and director of marketing and program development at the Canton Area YMCA . " I keep thinking we 'll see a slowdown , but it just keeps growing , We 've had 22 new companies call since September wanting to get in next year 's competition . " If they sign on for the fun and games , the number of organizations that field teams will swell to 120 , up from the original 48 . Events have increased from 6 to 16 since 1984 , and participation last year was up 33 percent over the previous year . <p> As successful and innovative as Cup competition is , its tools stretch back nearly 30 years to a near  --  tragedy that threatened to permanently sideline one of Canton 's most active civic leaders , Suzanne Timken . <p> " I was about 24 years old at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recounts . " Because of the pregnancy , I had n't ridden a horse in several months and was anxious to get back into the saddle . When my recuperation time was up , I was given permission to exercise our jumper . It was horrible ; the horse ran away , threw me , and I broke my back . I remember telling the doctor in the hospital that I had to recover because I wanted to have more children . He said , ' Well , then , you 're going to have to really strengthen your lower back and your neck because you 've sustained a lot of injury to both of them . ' " <p> She took him at his word , and through exercise and hard work was able to restore her health . Today , she 's grateful for the experience . " The accident turned out to be a gift , " she says . " It got me firmly into exercise . I 've never had a problem with my back since then . and I went on to have two more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fitness . " <p> Suzanne 's commitment to a healthful lifestyle earned her a slot on the advisory board of President Reagan 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports in 1982 . When the Canton newspaper announced her appointment , one of the first persons to call her was John Thompson , the young new physical director of the Canton YMCA . Thompson , an exercise physiologist , had a big dream but no budget to underwrite it . He enlisted Suzanne 's help . <p> " He said he wanted to launch some kind of fitness competition that would involve the local corporations , " says Suzanne , currently vice chairman of President Bush 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports . " I told him that it was a great idea as long as the event was n't directed to the elite athlete . I wanted it geared to people of all fitness levels  --  secretaries , midnight shift workers , the everyday Joe and Jane who may not otherwise be reached by the wellness movement . " <p> The project began to take shape . Committees were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a slogan was selected that summed up the spirit of the contest : " Fit or Unfit , Join Your Company Team . " To make sure team members were fit for the fight , a training program was conducted three months before the first Cup competition . Hundreds of participants and their families turned out al the local football field for an exercise class led by the Timken-Thompson duo . Suddenly , the entire city of Canton was buying into the idea that fitness was looking better  --  m more ways than one . Local fitness facilities were loaded with new faces , pools were full , and jogging trails were packed as everyone settled , down to the serious business of training . <p> When she was n't leading exercises she was on recruiting missions to local companies , looking for likely corporate bodies . " I remember talking to my husband 's secretary at the Timken Company , " she says . " Margie had never done anything like this in her whole life , but I said , ' Margie. we need you on the Timken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first a quarter mile , then a half mile  --  and she ended up being in one of the relays . " <p> The competition 's theme , " We 're All in This Together , " extended to financing the event as well as fielding the teams . The philosophy was to not allow any one company to pick up the tab and not rely on public funds . Rather , the sponsorship was spread over a number of organizations . A spirit of community was generated when 12 sponsors , ranging from banks to corporations , agreed to share in the financial support of the program . <p> " Logically , a hospital should sponsor this kind of event , but we have three hospitals in town , " Suzanne says . " When I called on the first hospital , the directors agreed that of course they would be a sponsor ; in fact , they would underwrite the whole thing . I said , ' No , you do n't understand . We 're all in this together . ' " <p> She and Thompson never doubted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as convinced as they were of its success , they never suspected its spin-off benefits . What started as a city competition quickly expanded to a county event , and organizations began attaching a variety of wellness activities to the basic Cup contest . Doctors Hospital of Stark County hosted a free picnic hunch . complete with a lecture on cholesterol and diet ; Massillon Community Hospital offered a series on weight loss ; Aultman Hospital designed a course on stress management : , and Timken Mercy Medical Center sponsored a seminar on exercise . Suddenly , wellness was a year-round concern , and everyone was talking fitness . <p> " From the beginning , the purpose of the Cup has been to get people to evaluate their lifestyles and to make some positive changes , " says John Usmial , who has overseen the project since its second year . " Kids see their parents competing and having fun rather than sitting on the couch watching TV . This sends a great message and provides good role models . The other key goals are to promote camaraderie among employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission has been met and the goals realized , but no ceiling is seen on the success . Usmial agrees that even the best projects have their limits . but the Community Corporate Cup is far from reaching its potential . <p> " There are about 500,000 people in our county , " he says . " To really get into health and wellness and to really affect the entire community , we should achieve the goal of 100 percent participation . Of course , that will never happen , but we need to always keep that in mind and constantly be working to involve more people .
