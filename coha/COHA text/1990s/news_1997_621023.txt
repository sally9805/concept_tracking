<p> In the small towns of California 's fertile valleys , baseball diamonds have long been a welcome sight among the patchwork fields of lettuce and tomatoes and endless rows of almond trees and grapevines . <p> Those once gleaming minor league stadiums may have weathered and cracked over the years , but baseball purists still revere their quirky charm . In a sport that rejoices in its past , fans can sit in the bleachers and see in the faces of young athletes the thousands who played there before , scooping up grounders and stretching singles into doubles in a quest to prove themselves ready for the major leagues . <p> In Stockton , where the legendary Casey struck out more than 100 years ago , Billy Hebert Field stands in an oak-dotted park , a reminder of those golden days . The perennial flooding that gave the town the nickname Mudville has been largely brought under control . Each year , though , when the Class A Stockton Ports pay tribute to the famous poem by pulling on the old wool uniforms and striped caps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simpler times , when one at-bat meant more to a town than art programs or additional cops on the streets . <p> But club owners see nothing but trouble in the uncomfortable bleachers , dreary rest rooms and dirt parking lots of rickety parks like Billy Hebert Field . What 's catching their attention are ritzy new stadiums equipped with big league amenities like luxury boxes and picnic plazas , modern stereo systems and paved parking lots  --  all created with a theme , anything from the aerospace industry to the state 's propensity for earthquakes . <p> " This is the United States . People like something new , " said California League President Joe Gagliardi , who has lobbied cities up and down the state for new stadiums . " If you can go to a nice , clean ballpark with a nice atmosphere and spend your money where you 're happy to do so , why would you go to an old dilapidated place ? " <p> The same new-stadium frenzy that has hit big league cities like San Francisco , Baltimore , Cleveland and Denver has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Class A leagues in the country . Class A leagues are below Triple A and Double A minor leagues ; all are stepping stones to the big leagues . <p> Driven by demands from major league owners that minor league affiliates improve their city-owned facilities , the California League has seen a building boom unlike any in its history  --  which officially began in 1941 , but has roots in the old Highway 99 League born in 1891 . <p> Although most of the league used to be based in Northern California  --  to keep things balanced , San Jose was not long ago a southern division team  --  the league has now shifted dramatically southward . And since 1991 , growing cities like Rancho Cucamonga and Lake Elsinore in California 's so-called Inland Empire  --  the high desert region south and east of Los Angeles  --  have thrown millions of dollars into luxurious stadiums to lure teams away from towns that refused to upgrade their parks . <p> Attendance has soared at new stadiums , but a cautionary tale has emerged : Lake Elsinore 's sparkling stadium , The Diamond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price tag soared from $ 14 million to nearly $ 24 million . Last year , the City Council mortgaged the very lake it is named after for $ 14.8 million to make the first loan payments on the deal . <p> Towns in the Central Valley , where the history of California baseball is as rich as the soil , have lagged behind . Bakersfield , Visalia and Stockton have upgraded their old ballparks to meet minimum standards but have not built new ones . The San Jose Giants have n't asked for a new park yet , but their Municipal Stadium home has old plumbing and wiring and nowhere near the amenities of stadiums in the south . <p> In Modesto , the prospect of losing a 51-year-old California League franchise last year convinced a slim majority of the City Council to spend nearly $ 4 million to rebuild the 42-year-old John Thurman Field , home of the Modesto A 's . It was n't a lot compared to the stadium budgets down south , and that made it easier for Modesto Mayor Dick Lang to say yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition in our community , " Lang said . " To lose it would be a terrible thing . " <p> On a warm May afternoon in Modesto , workers scurried around putting finishing touches on the new John Thurman Field off Highway 99 . With only a few hours to go until the first pitch , there were still distance markers to be installed on the outfield fences , handrails to be attached along ramps and seat backs to be screwed onto bleachers . The smell of steaming hot dogs wafted over the stadium , mingling with the scents of fresh paint and fragrant redwood chips scattered around just-planted marigolds . <p> Tim Marting , vice president of the Modesto A 's , looked happy but tired and a little nervous . This day had been a long time coming  --  140 days of construction preceded by five years of fretting about whether the new park would become a reality . Now comes the real test , seeing if the park draws more fans . <p> " What we have to overcome here is 42 years of perception , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of days earlier . For years , the Modesto A 's , a Class A team franchise of the Oakland A 's , had dismal attendance despite strong lineups of future stars including Mark McGwire , Jose Canseco , Ernie Young and Walt Weiss . <p> The old park was cramped , with just 2,500 seats , mostly uncomfortable metal bleachers without backrests . The restrooms were small , the locker rooms dank and the field dipped in the middle . The center field fence was only 365 feet deep , making home-run statistics suspect . <p> " We needed improved facilities , and we needed improved fan support , " Oakland A 's president Sandy Alderson said after pronouncing himself happy with the renovated stadium . " It 's important for our players to play in front of good-sized crowds . " <p> On May 7 , opening night for the new stadium , a standing-room-only crowd of 4,294 turned out for the festivities . Speeches were given and tributes were read . When a helicopter landed in center field and the " L'il A 's " new mascot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept up in the emotion of a man jumping around in a bulky gray elephant suit and dozens of proud team and city leaders bursting with civic pride . <p> The fans quickly discovered that the new bleachers made a wonderfully loud noise when stomped in unison , and they kept up a steady beat while opening lineups were announced . When parachutists sky- dived in to deliver the first ball , more than 4,000 necks craned to pick out rainbow-colored canopies from the twilight sky . <p> " This is what the city of Modesto had to do to maintain a ballclub here , " a pleased Gagliardi said , watching the game from the right- field picnic area . " It is now a spacious park . It has a great feeling . " <p> Since the new stadium opened , Modesto 's attendance has averaged 2,340 fans a game , up from about 1,300 last year . <p> " The stadium will sell itself , " Marting said . " We will break attendance records in 1997 , but we will shatter them in 1998 . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have already toppled league attendance records . In fact , by the Class A All-Star break this past week , it had drawn 205,013 fans , which put it at No. 2 in the country for Class A teams , behind only Lansing in the Midwest League . <p> The city 's $ 16 million ballpark , the Epicenter , has been rocking since it opened in 1993 after wooing a team from San Bernardino . Outside , it looks like a typical Southern California office building with palm trees lining its plaza . A towering bronze statue of the late Jack Benny , who used the name Cucamonga in his routines for comic effect , greets fans inside the gate . <p> Inside , the Epicenter is loaded with special effects and attractions . Some fans sit in the barbecue pavilion , while others play carnival games like Wheel of Fortune . Two mascots , dinosaurs named Tremor and Aftershock , roam the stands , and before the game , the theme song plays : " At the Epicenter , baby , whole lot of quaking going on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kayla , 6 , and Cole , 3 , to games every other week . They used to go to Dodgers games , but now they sit in the pavilion and eat dinner while watching the game , knowing they can get home without fighting freeway traffic back from Los Angeles . <p> " The minor leagues are more exciting . You could easily have a 10- run game , " Mulick said . " And for $ 20 , you get to sit at a table and get four seats . " The young players taking batting practice on the major-league-quality field say nothing compares with the thrill of competing in a park packed with cheering fans . <p> " This is really incredible , " said Mick Fieldbinder , a right-handed pitcher for the visiting Stockton Ports . " This place is state-of-the-art , top-notch . It 's nice coming to a ballpark and seeing people buy tickets to see you play . " <p> Fieldbinder is more accustomed to small crowds in Stockton , which has the second-worst attendance in the California League this year , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 5,858 fans per game , while Stockton , a Milwaukee Brewers minor league team , is drawing 1,382 . The owners of the Quakes have spent almost $ 8 million since the park opened to add bleachers , build a second barbecue pavilion and a terrace , because the attendance has been so strong , said Tom Henderson , the team 's executive vice president . <p> Michael Curto , the voice of the Quakes on KCKC AM , thinks the Epicenter outshines most major league parks in California in its style and amenities . <p> " It 's better than Jack Murphy Stadium ( in San Diego ) , " he said . " It 's better than the Oakland Coliseum . It 's better than Dodger Stadium . That 's 30 years old . " <p> P arks in San Jose , Bakersfield , Visalia and Stockton all predate Dodger Stadium . Unlike the glittering new stadiums , their fields look more like college diamonds  --  and in fact , San Jose 's Municipal Stadium hosts not only the San Jose Giants but also San Jose State University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Jose Giants , has n't demanded a new stadium . In fact , he plays up the nostalgia there . <p> " We like it because it is a throwback , " Stavrenos said . " It 's got a lot of character . We try to put a lot of tradition into it . " <p> Municipal Stadium was upgraded over the last few years to meet baseball standards , but most of those improvements were in things the fans ca n't see  --  the clubhouse , the trainer 's room , the laundry equipment . For some fans , though , the spartan stadium is a welcome setting in which to concentrate on a game . <p> " Not everyone wants to go to a brand-spanking-new stadium , " said General Manager Mark Wilson . " There 's still some people who enjoy a Fenway Park or a Wrigley Field . That 's what we have to compare ourselves to . " <p> Roger Angell , the writer and baseball essayist for the New Yorker magazine , values the old ballparks because fans are right on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leagues is that it used to be the opposite of what we saw in big league ballparks , " Angell said . " It all seemed of human proportions . Now , they 're really keeping players away from us . They 're taking it away , and it tugs at the heartstrings . " <p> Bakersfield 's Sam Lynn Ballpark , named for a founding father of the California League , is the epitome of an old-time park , with enough quirks to send shivers down a traditionalist 's spine . The sun sets behind center field  --  an almost unheard-of orientation because it blinds the batter  --  and it 's only 354 feet to deep center . The Bakersfield Blaze , now a San Francisco Giants affiliate , was one of the original teams in the California League . <p> Attendance is bad , though , and team owners think a new stadium would increase fan interest just as it has for Southern California teams . But Jack Patton , the Blaze 's general manager , has been turned down by both Bakersfield City Council and the Kern County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come and court us , I would say that we have given the city of Bakersfield and the county of Kern every opportunity to keep pro baseball here . We would just bow out , " Patton said . <p> " I 'm as historically sentimental about the league and about baseball as anybody , but at the same time , I think these communities have to step up to the plate . <p> " Minor league baseball has grown so much in popularity that the have-nots are coveting the haves . The haves had better do something . It does n't always have to be in the form of a brand-new stadium , but at least working to improve what they have . " <p> S an Bernardino , smarting from losing its team to Rancho Cucamonga , decided to get minor league baseball back by luring a team from Salinas , which was later renamed the Stampede . The city spent more than $ 13 million in redevelopment bonds to replace its aging Fiscalini Field for a new park called the Ranch , in a redevelopment area near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened at the end of last season , and so far this year , attendance is averaging 3,770 a game , double last season 's numbers . <p> " Most of us felt this was money well-spent , in that it was redevelopment dollars cleaning up blight and giving us jobs , " said Mayor Tom Minor . <p> The stadium , a lovely Mission- style building with arched entryways and tile trim , was designed by HOK architects , the firm that designed Camden Yards in Baltimore , Coors Field in Denver and the planned Pacific Bell Park for the San Francisco Giants . <p> HOK also designed the Hangar stadium for the Lancaster Jethawks , which opened last year . That field , with an F-16 jet at its entrance in tribute to neighboring Edwards Air Force Base , looks nothing like the Ranch , but it has some of the details that make the new stadiums so attractive to fans and ballclubs  --  theater-style seats , entertaining scoreboards with video screens and first-class fields , locker rooms and training facilities . <p> Jason Watson , the general manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Field at all . <p> " We still keep it down-home and friendly , " Watson said . " We will always provide our fans with a good entertainment value . We 're building nostalgia for the future . Every night after the game , the kids can run around the bases . The parents love it , and the kids love it , and someday they 'll look back on it with nostalgia . " <p> A bout an hour 's drive from Rancho Cucamonga , Lake Elsinore , an area popular with boaters and skydivers , sits just off Interstate 15 . The Diamond is easy to pick out  --  its three-story edifice rises from the lake 's shore , and the field faces the freeway , beckoning drivers to come on down to watch a game . <p> The tan brick building with a green sloping roof evokes ballparks of old . Inside , murals of hot dogs and frosty mugs of beer are painted on the brick above a concession stand , highlighted by a red neon " EATS " sign . <p> Overlooking left field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that seats 240 . More can sit outside on a terraced deck , relaxing with a beer and dining on Chinese chicken salad with a perfect view of the game . <p> Chris Speier , the manager of the High Desert Mavericks of Adelanto , had brought his team to Lake Elsinore one unseasonably hot afternoon last month . The former Giant remembered his days as a minor leaguer , more than 20 years ago , when young players never dreamed of such luxurious surroundings . <p> " Usually , most parks were just a grandstand with a field and lights you probably would n't be able to light your driveway with , " Speier said . " We old managers sit around and talk about how we 're spoiling these kids . They have no idea of the kinds of conditions that we were under . " <p> Still , Speier , his face tanned and lined from years of playing under hot summer suns , would n't want to go back to the old times . <p> " You look back 20 years ago and say it was nostalgic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it , it was horrendous . " <p> Dwayne Murphy , a former Oakland A 's outfielder and hitting coach for the Mavericks , stretched his arms over the dugout bench as he reminisced about the old bandboxes he played in . He prefers stadiums like Lake Elsinore 's . <p> " They do n't come any better than this , " he said , his eyes shaded by sleek sunglasses . " In order for a city to have a professional baseball team , they should upgrade their ballparks . " <p> Most fans seem to agree . Roger and Kay Meadows , a retired couple from Hemet , spend a lot of time going to California League ballparks in the Inland Empire . Their favorite is Lake Elsinore 's . <p> " It 's just remarkable . There 's just not a bad seat in the house , " Kay Meadows said . " It sure beats going into L.A. to watch the Dodgers or Angels . And the price is right . That 's why we quit going to the major leagues  --  they just priced us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it built the stadium . The city had wooed the Angels ' affiliate from Palm Springs with the promise of a $ 14 million park for the 1994 season , and when construction fell behind , they had to take out another $ 10 million loan to pay for round-the-clock crews to be ready on opening day . <p> Lake Elsinore Mayor Kevin Pape , who was not on the council when the stadium was approved , said he wo n't second-guess his predecessors . <p> " They thought they were doing the best they could at the time , " he said . " I think they had in mind that they wanted to do something that was nice and something the community could be proud of . " <p> Even though the town mortgaged its 3,300-acre lake for $ 14.8 million last year , Pape still thinks the stadium , which is second in the California League in attendance , is an asset . <p> " If you want a good family activity and you want to attract other recreation-type businesses , this is a good way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake Elsinore 's problems , California League president Gagliardi said he wants to persuade more cities with old parks to build new stadiums . If they wo n't , he 'll try to find different cities that will . <p> " Communities should not be afraid to tackle keeping a pro sport in their town , " he said . " Even if they 're paying some tax dollars for it , it 's good for the town . " <p> All the cities with old parks lag in attendance , but Gagliardi has chosen Stockton as his next priority . Billy Hebert Field just barely meets pro baseball standards . <p> " It 's an older park that has some of the old-time charm , but it has older amenities that do n't keep up with newer parks , " said Stockton Ports general manager Dan Chapman . The team is up for sale , so nothing will happen before the end of the season , but Chapman said the worst-case scenario could be relocation . <p> The park is hard to get to from the freeway , and while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best part of Stockton . But Stockton officials do n't foresee a new park , especially without an ironclad , long-term contract from the Ports . <p> " It 's just a tough sell right now , " said Pete Waller , program manager for Stockton 's parks and recreation program . " We 're still feeling the wrath of Proposition 13 . We 're trying to rebuild . " <p> Waller said Stockton would like to preserve the pro baseball tradition that traces itself back to the Mudville Nine . Officials are well aware that those days may be numbered , and they fear the outcome may be the same as when mighty Casey struck out . <p> " It will be a sad day in Mudville , that 's for sure , " Waller said . <p> . ON THE WAY UP The 10 teams of the California League are not just training grounds for their big league affiliates  --  they make up one of the best Class A leagues in the country . .
