I trace much of the distemper between the sexes to the fact that men can reproduce in near perpetuity , marrying and remarrying , having second and third families , with rarely a raised eyebrow about their right to do so . For men who have a late child , there 's a nudge and a wink from your pals , a spread in People if you 're Clint Eastwood , and a bump in the polls if you 're Strom Thurmond . A trophy kid is so common among the ' 90s tycoons , you 'd think it was a corporate perk , like stock options . Meanwhile , a woman 's peak childbearing years coincide precisely with her peak career-building years . Try having a baby at age 38 while your tier of associates at Shearman &; Sterling is up for partnership . See who becomes " of counsel . " <P> Still , the news that a 63-year-old California woman gave birth to a baby girl gave me pause . She will be pushing 80 when this child is denting the family car , filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 63 is not the outer limit . What this birth shows is that by using donor eggs , a woman can carry a child well into her dotage , like the legendary Thurmond . Think about it : Mother Teresa could become a mother . <P> Dr. Mark Sauer , director of the fertility program at New York City 's Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center , admits that the uproar " speaks to ageism and a double standard in society . " Though the cutoff in his program is 55 ( there 's no cutoff for men ) , he had treated the woman earlier , believing she was 53 . Now that she has given birth , he says , " I 'm happy with the outcome , but I ca n't endorse the practice because of the risks . We see serious obstetrical complications in more than half the women over the age of 45 . " But if a woman accepts the risk , this medical advance could alter the emotional landscape . With her clock not ticking , a woman of a certain age will be less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he is still treating relationships as if they were disposable diapers . Gradually , it might even become fashionable for older women to marry younger men . <P> But because women can have babies past their prime , just like men , does it mean they should abuse the privilege , just like men ? Why not adopt an older child ? Is n't having a baby so late selfish  --  especially if both are codgers  --  robbing a child of parents who can toss a ball and chaperone the camping trip ? <P> Sadly , adoption is often not an option ; past menopause , it 's more difficult than learning how to program a VCR . And 9 out of 10 reasons for having a child have always been selfish  --  from having an extra farmhand , to all my friends are having kids , to I 'm bored with wine tours of Provence . The older the parents , the more serious the decision . What an older mother loses to lower back pain , she gains in serenity and perspective . Only the most determined women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her only son was killed in a motorcycle accident , are going to undertake 2 a.m. feedings and toilet training in their seventh decade . There are n't going to be many such mothers , but if medicine can help make it so , why not greet them with the same joy accorded Tony Randall , who appeared on David Letterman the same day news about the California mother broke . He had just had his first child at 77 , without any fear that a doctor could tell him not to .
