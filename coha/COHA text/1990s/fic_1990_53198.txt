Sunlight glimmered on the grass , glinted off the black tombstones ahead of Mrs. Kawaguchi . The cemetery grounds had been newly mowed for the Memorial Day weekend and were damp from yesterday 's rain ; her heels sank deeply into the earth . Wisps of grass clung to her shoes and she could feel the moisture seep into the stockings around her toes , but this pleased her . It was like penance . She must violate the land of buried spirits and so tread lightly , each step soft with apology . <p> A few yards behind Mrs. Kawaguchi walked her son , Curtis , and his white wife , Amanda , carrying their fourteen-month-old baby in her arms . Mrs. Kawaguchi was relieved that they had agreed to visit the cemetery before driving on to the airport , where Curtis and Amanda would board a plane to the Bahamas . Curtis was to lead a seminar on tax shelters there ; Amanda , a violinist , would accompany him because , as she told Mrs. Kawaguchi , she felt stressed and had not taken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt their presence today at the grave site of her dead husband , Mas , would prove something to him . <p> " Curtis ! " <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi turned at the sound of Amanda 's voice and saw her hopping on one foot , the baby slipping from her arms . One of her shoes had become stuck in the muddy ground . <p> Curtis stepped quickly back to retrieve Amanda 's shoe . <p> " Not the shoe , Curtis . Take the baby . " Amanda struggled to lift the infant , who began to shriek . The baby was colicky and still mysteriously prone to crying . <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi took a few steps toward Amanda , but resisted the impulse to run and rescue the baby from her arms . Instead she began to walk quickly toward her dead husband 's grave again , pretending not to notice . Twigs cracked as they broke beneath her feet . She wanted to arrive at the tombstones first , to have a few words with Mas before the others joined her . <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi came to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband and her husband 's parents of dust and bird droppings . For several months after he died , three years earlier , Mrs. Kawaguchi tried not to notice her husband 's name or to see her own already carved there in even round letters , with only the date of her death left conspicuously blank . For a while she stopped going to the cemetery altogether , but thoughts of accumulating dust and the displeasure of her dead in-laws forced her to bring a brush and pail one Saturday . It had been a particularly hot day , and as she rested her palm against the smooth , polished granite , she felt the heat prickle her skin . Pressing harder , she felt the warmth spin and buzz against the palm of her hand . She closed her eyes . An image arose of Mas lying in their bed on a hot summer night , his thick eyebrows furrowed , sweating in his sleep under the light blanket , unable to kick it off . Mrs. Kawaguchi then fetched some water from a spigot and released it over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . She now imagined Mas asleep in the rocking chair on their porch , smiling faintly as a cool evening breeze brushed over him . Curtis is going to marry that hakujin girl , she began to tell Mas . That brittle one . The one with pale eyes like cut crystal , whose legs tapped nervously , whose quiet voice when she called Curtis seemed like the slamming of a door . I do n't know , she said at the end . She wondered if she was being unreasonable . Perhaps she was prejudiced . She shook her head and returned to the spigot . On that day she poured water onto the gravestones again and again , until the grass beneath her had disappeared into a dark brown pool , only the pink flesh of her instep emerging . <p> Now Mrs. Kawaguchi knelt , setting down her brush and pail , and bowed briefly in front of the graves of her parents-in-law . Shibaraku desu , she thought in greeting , then hesitated . She felt she should add something more , but nothing else came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles to them . She shifted her body to face her husband 's grave . <p> Curtis is here with Amanda and the baby , she told Mas silently . Watch , and you 'll see I 'm not making things up . Mrs. Kawaguchi imagined him frowning , as if she were bothering him during a football game on TV , telling him to shave and change into a nicer shirt because company was coming . You 'll see how they are , how she treats the baby . Mas would snort , but she would have his attention . <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi opened her eyes and saw Curtis and Amanda standing behind the graves , watching her . <p> " This is Dad 's Buddhist name , right , Mom ? " Curtis trailed the baby 's hand along the Chinese characters engraved upon the back of the stone . <p> " What does it say ? " Amanda asked , squinting at the letters . " I wish I knew Japanese , " she said , sighing . <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi considered not answering Amanda 's question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To her , and to Curtis as well , the name would simply be strange sounds . But she told them anyway . <p> " Is n't it odd how Christians get names when they 're confirmed , and Buddhists get names when they die ? " Amanda remarked . <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi nodded and lifted the rusted water cans from their holders at the base of the gravestones . She threw out the murky water remaining inside . As she stood , Curtis asked , " Want me to fill them ? " <p> She pointed in the direction of the closest spigot . <p> " I know . I remember , " Curtis said . He held out the baby , who reached toward Amanda with open hands . <p> " We do n't have to carry him the whole time , " Amanda said , crossing her arms . " Besides , it 's your turn . Put him down . " <p> " But the grass is wet . " <p> " It 's not that wet , " Amanda said . <p> " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No thanks , Mom . " <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi 's stomach pinched . Amanda had begun calling her this during a family Christmas party last year . The husband and wives of her other children called her Mom , and so Amanda also acquired the habit . They had been standing before the stove making gravy for the turkey the first time it happened . Amanda had nearly whispered it , and Mrs. Kawaguchi tried hard to act natural , to smile at Amanda , who asked if she should add another bouillon cube . Now Mrs. Kawaguchi looked down and noticed a dandelion , which she pulled out and put aside to throw away later . <p> Amanda placed the baby on the ground before the graves . " Eliot likes the grass , do n't you , Eliot ? " Amanda said . The baby clung to the sleeve of Amanda 's blouse . " Here , let 's pray , sweetie , " she said , squatting behind the baby and holding his tiny fists together . Amanda bowed her head , but the baby squirmed in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . The baby turned his head to look at Mrs. Kawaguchi . He sucked on his thumb . <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi closed her eyes and said , See ? to her dead husband . She heard Amanda say , " I only met him once . " <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi nodded . Now that Amanda was squatting in front of his grave , Mrs. Kawaguchi imagined Mas suddenly sitting up , clearing his throat , smoothing down his hair . The first and only time Amanda came to visit while Mas was alive , he had extended his hand , smiling . " Call me Mike , " he had said . " Mike " was the American name he assumed after working at the insurance company . His first business cards read " Masahiro ' Mike ' Kawaguchi . " Later , the first name and the quotation marks were dropped . <p> Mas , Mrs. Kawaguchi thought , would now smile pleasantly to Amanda . He had had more experience working with white people and was more comfortable around them than she herself was . While Mas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to people like her children 's teachers during Open House . Mrs. Kawaguchi used to feel bewildered but also shamed by Mas ' friendliness ; since leaving the camps she believed that white people were still vaguely suspicious of her . Because of that , she thought there was no reason for Mas to be so polite  --  it was n't fair . But then she remembered that she and her friends used to jitterbug to the happy music of Glenn Miller , their tightly permed hair barely moving . They had no right to such music . " You do n't have to be afraid of them , " Mas had told her . She denied that she was and explained that they simply made her a little nervous . Now that she had come to know Amanda , she understood there was nothing to be afraid of . Except , of course , for the baby . <p> " I only met him once , " Amanda said again . <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi opened her eyes . Had Amanda expected her to respond the first time ? It seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Amanda meant to apologize . She of course had nothing to say to Mas in prayer , as Mrs. Kawaguchi had nothing to say to her in-laws . Mrs. Kawaguchi nodded . " Those are pretty flowers , " she said . <p> Curtis walked back with four new cans , which were clean and shone with the water dripping down the sides . " I found these in another grave , " he said , smiling . " Dad might as well have new ones . " <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi frowned and stared at the cans . " It 's not nice , " she said . She wondered again , as she lately found herself doing , why his sensibility was so different from hers or from her other children 's . Perhaps it was because he was the youngest . Mas had become an insurance salesman and sold the azalea nursery , where she helped prune or re-pot plants while the children played in the potting soil beside her , when Curtis was only five . Even then he was different from the others . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brown hands out to her once , appalled by the mud crusted on his skin . " It 's only dirt , " she told him , and then dug a small hole and added water , thinking he would enjoy the feel of the clay oozing between his fingers . But when she took his fists and submerged them into the mud , Curtis had shrieked and jerked his fists back . Another time , during a particularly dry summer , he had pointed to the cracks in the ground and screamed that the earth was breaking . She held him to her stomach and stroked his thin back , surprised that he would think such a strange thing , that the earth would betray them this way . <p> Curtis , however , did not seem afraid of people . As a child , he would introduce himself and Mrs. Kawaguchi to store clerks or other strangers . When he was older , he would tell Mrs. Kawaguchi not to let people take advantage of her . Once at a restaurant , she had left a tip even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their food nearly cold . Inside the car , Curtis , then in high school , put the tip money into Mrs. Kawaguchi 's hand , saying , " I swiped it off the table . You do n't leave tips for witches like that . " Mrs. Kawaguchi was worried that the waitress would come storming out , demanding the tip , or that she would treat all people like them , with faces like theirs , badly in the future . That she would consider them all cheap . Mrs. Kawaguchi had sighed and hoped at least that the waitress would think they were Chinese . <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi shook her head at the new cans . <p> " What 's the difference ? " Curtis asked , setting them on the grass . " They belong to the cemetery , not to the graves . " <p> " It 's not nice , " Mrs. Kawaguchi said . She felt she must apologize for her son 's behavior and closed her eyes briefly . <p> " Do you want me to go all the way back ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She saw the white cuffs of his shirt , sharp and stiff in the sunlight . <p> " Never mind , " Mrs. Kawaguchi said . <p> " Here , Dad , " Curtis said , slipping the cans into their holders in the ground . " Nice clean cans for you and everybody . Mom 's going to arrange some nice flowers that Amanda brought . " <p> " Shall I help you ? " Amanda asked Mrs. Kawaguchi , who unwrapped the plastic paper from flowers . <p> " No thanks , " Mrs. Kawaguchi said , but noticed a movement in Amanda 's cheek , her thin skin like a sheet of waxed paper crinkling . " All right , if you like , " Mrs. Kawaguchi said and laid a handkerchief on the grass for Amanda to kneel on . <p> " Curtis , will you take Eliot back to the car and change his diapers ? " Amanda asked , taking some flowers from the bunch . Curtis walked away with the baby . <p> Amanda spread the flowers before her . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kawaguchi cut the stems of the carnations under the water in the cans . " Helps bring the water up , " she explained to Amanda . <p> Amanda nodded and did the same . " I never learned about these things . My mother never taught me . " <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi shrugged . " Your mother 's a professor . She knows a lot of things . " <p> Amanda said nothing . Mrs. Kawaguchi knew that Amanda and her mother did not get along . Once she told Mrs. Kawaguchi how nice it was that their family was so close ; her own mother , Amanda confided , had never told her she loved her . <p> " I 've never told my children that either , " Mrs. Kawaguchi had said . <p> " But I know you love them . It 's obvious . " <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi wondered what was obvious . How was Amanda 's family so different ? When she asked Curtis about this later , he told her that Amanda 's mother was neurotic . Amanda had once found a box of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Amanda and her mother , and in each the face of one or the other was blurred by white crease lines , as if someone had folded the picture to pinch the images . Hearing this , Mrs. Kawaguchi had shuddered . She pictured Amanda , an only child , hiding in her mother 's closet as a little girl , putting her arms through the sleeves of her mother 's coat , rubbing her cheek against the harsh camel hair , smelling . As far as Mrs. Kawaguchi knew , Amanda never visited her parents , who were divorced . At the wedding Amanda 's mother had sat by herself in a black suit , her slim legs pressed together tightly , smoking cigarettes and sipping from her empty champagne glass . <p> " That 's a pretty arrangement , " Amanda now said , looking over at the flowers Mrs. Kawaguchi had placed in the cans . She shaded her eyes with her hand . The shadow she cast over her face darkened the blue of her eyes and made them , Mrs. Kawaguchi felt , easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Amanda smiled at her . <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi felt uncomfortable . " It 's nothing , " she said . Curtis had told Mrs. Kawaguchi that Amanda often praised her ability to do certain things  --  cook , garden , knit  --  that Amanda herself did not do well . Domestic things that Amanda thought a mother should do . Amanda needed a mother , Mrs. Kawaguchi thought . That was why she could not take care of her own child . She felt Amanda 's gaze on her , but began to pick up the leaves and cut stems off the ground with her head bent . She made a pile on the wrapping paper that the flowers came in , adding the uprooted dandelion to it . <p> The baby began to cry in the distance . Mrs. Kawaguchi glanced over to Amanda , who seemed not to notice . She was busy sticking daisies into the lower edge of her arrangement , as Mrs. Kawaguchi had done . <p> " The baby , " Mrs. Kawaguchi said . <p> Amanda lifted her head and looked toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? " Then she began cutting the stem of the last daisy and said , " Curtis can handle it . " <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi turned away from Amanda , again saying , See ? to her dead husband . She rose and told Amanda that she would wash her hands . Amanda nodded , then pressed her hands together in prayer before Mas ' grave . The baby kept crying . <p> When Mrs. Kawaguchi returned from the spigot , she saw Amanda finally arise and walk toward the car . Mrs. Kawaguchi hurried over to the gravestones . She took incense out of her purse , lit a bundle of sticks , and laid them against the stone base . <p> See how she is ? Mrs. Kawaguchi asked , closing her eyes . <p> She saw Mas sitting at their kitchen table , reading a newspaper . He would lower the paper and frown at her . What about it ? Mas would say . <p> She does n't want the baby . <p> Of course she wants him . All mothers want their babies , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She does n't even think her own mother loves her . She and Curtis have schedules , Mas . They take turns . <p> That 's the modern way . Mas would lift the newspaper again . <p> If it 's Curtis ' turn and he 's on the phone , then she 'll bring the baby to him and tell him to change his diaper . Curtis has to hang up , and Amanda keeps reading on the couch . It 's unnatural . <p> What can you do ? Mas would shrug . <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi wondered what Amanda had said to Mas . She had knelt before his grave for a long time . What did she want ? Mrs. Kawaguchi asked Mas . <p> He would look toward Amanda , shaking his head with sympathy . <p> I feel sorry for her , too , Mrs. Kawaguchi told Mas . <p> Try to be nice to her . <p> But what about the baby ? she argued . <p> What can you do ? Quit worrying so much about it . Mas would fold his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TV . There 's nothing you can do , he 'd call from the other room . <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi wondered if this was true . She opened her eyes but had to shut them again because the sunlight was so bright . <p> At the airport , Amanda paced in front of the window by the boarding gate with the baby in her arms . She murmured into his ear , pointing at the baggage carts that whipped up beside the planes . She acts like a mother now , Mrs. Kawaguchi thought . <p> When the final boarding call was made , Amanda handed the baby over to Mrs. Kawaguchi . <p> " I feel so bad about leaving him behind . " Amanda bowed her head slightly . <p> " Do n't worry . Enjoy yourselves , " Mrs. Kawaguchi said . <p> Curtis kissed the baby on the cheek . " Be good , Eliot . " <p> " I know I 'm leaving him in good hands . " Amanda stepped toward Mrs. Kawaguchi to give her a hug . The baby was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's stiff back . " Better than my own , probably . " <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi could not bring herself to deny this . " Do n't worry , " she said again . " Have a good time . " She lifted up the baby 's hand to wave as Curtis and Amanda disappeared through the boarding tunnel . <p> At home , Mrs. Kawaguchi lay down beside the baby on her bed . He had cried in the car but was quiet now . She stroked his back , whispering , " Naoki , Naoki , " his Japanese middle name that she used when they were alone and whenever she thought of him . She did not like the name " Eliot . " His eyes were wide as he watched her at first , but then his eyelids fluttered and closed . The pink flush of sleep spread over his cheeks . <p> She went to her rocking chair by the window and stared at the evergreen pear tree in the middle of her backyard . The new leaves trembled in the wind , now flashing silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old tree , the trunk thick , the many branches twisting and turning away from the center , becoming thinner and thinner until , finally , they were but twigs at the tips . <p> Why is Amanda the way she is ? Mrs. Kawaguchi wondered . <p> She was an erratic line drawn this way and that , like the bent thin branches of that tree . Like the tree , Amanda 's family was old . Mrs. Kawaguchi 's own was young ; she counted her family from her parents ' generation , the immigrants . Of her parents ' families in Japan she knew only that they were poor farmers in a small village . But Amanda 's family had come to America years and years ago , each generation becoming richer and thinner . Only poor people , it seemed to her , were fat . There was something in the accumulation of their family 's history that had made Amanda 's mother brittle , that had made Amanda herself a nervous , twisted smaller branch . Was this a process that no family could escape ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curtis was the youngest , and he was already changing , a fragment of her and Mas . And what about the baby ? How could she change this tree ? How might she transplant him ? <p> She looked again at the sleeping child and saw the dust glittering in the afternoon sunlight , streaming toward the bed where he lay . She wished she could catch the dust before it settled onto his perfectly smooth face , but what could she do ? She reached for a fan . Fanning was all she could do now . She would blow the dust away with her wind . He could rest as if on the bed of a shallow stream , clear cool water sweeping over him . <p> She awoke when the baby began to whimper . Mrs. Kawaguchi took him into the kitchen and began to prepare his dinner . She cooked the vegetables herself , refusing to use the canned baby food that Amanda bought at the store . <p> She watched while he ate . Some of the mashed carrots bubbled from his lips , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the table . Mrs. Kawaguchi had seen Amanda wipe his mouth after every bite . She did not allow the baby to eat by himself yet . " It 's so messy , " Amanda had told her , sitting by the baby with a spoon in one hand and a wet towel in the other . Curtis and her other children , Mrs. Kawaguchi remembered , could feed themselves by the time they were a year old , but she said nothing to Amanda . <p> She pushed a bit of potato clinging to the edge of the baby 's lip , and the baby bit her finger . <p> " Oh ! " Mrs. Kawaguchi shook her hand . " That was not nice , Naoki . Why did you do that ? " <p> The baby stared at her . She refrained from using the word " No . " Amanda used it too often . She had seen him bite Amanda , too , when Amanda turned her head away to speak to someone . At those times , Amanda would not hit the baby but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly into this mouth . Once Naoki twisted his had away and spit the food onto the floor , and Amanda had grabbed his chin and jerked his face toward hers . Then she released him and looked up at Mrs. Kawaguchi , who could no tell if the expression on Amanda 's face was one of supplication , challenge , or apology . Had Amanda wanted Mrs. Kawaguchi to help her ? Mrs. Kawaguchi did n't know , so she walked out of the kitchen instead . <p> Now , rather than force the baby to eat , Mrs. Kawaguchi picked him up and stroked his head , humming . It was a lullaby she had sung to her children , a song in Japanese she only partially remembered about babies rocking in fishing boats , being carried away to other islands by the currents . After a while she returned the baby to his chair and placed her hand in his mouth . " Naoki ? " she asked . This time he did not bite her , but clutched her finger with his tiny , perfect hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Naoki sat on the floor beside her , playing with colored socks she had rolled up into different shapes . On the screen , policemen were carrying a baby out of a house and leading a confused and dirty little white girl down the steps . Child abuse , the newscaster explained . The girl had been handcuffed to her bed in the basement . Her brother had cigarette burns on his hands and genitals . Those children have visible scars , Mrs. Kawaguchi thought , but she knew what Naoki 's heart was like  --  a red open sore , the skin on the edges drying hard and white . She had seen how he cried when Amanda ignored him , how he dropped his head to the floor and banged the carpet with his hands , shrieking . During one of her first visits a few months after the baby was born , Mrs. Kawaguchi watched while the baby cried for an hour and Amanda held him up as if he were a sack of rice , swinging her arms fiercely . Amanda finally put the baby in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door was closed , Mrs. Kawaguchi knew that Amanda 's arm jerked as it drew the bow hard against the strings , white resin rising off in furious puffs . The shrill notes seemed to burst into the air like bits of shattering glass . Curtis sat in the living room reading . " Sometimes we just have to let the baby cry himself out , " he told her . Mrs. Kawaguchi got up to leave . <p> That night , Curtis and Amanda called from the Bahamas . They wanted to speak to the baby , but Mrs. Kawaguchi told them he was sleeping . <p> " Already ? " Amanda asked . " Is he coming down with something ? " she wanted to know . <p> " No , " Mrs. Kawaguchi said , " he just wants to sleep . " <p> In the morning , Mrs. Kawaguchi weeded her garden while Naoki played beside her , crawling through the grass after his ball . The sunlight warmed her shoulders and cast a halo on the top of the baby 's head . He threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her next-door neighbor appeared at the fence and called out . Mrs. Kawaguchi waved , although she did not like the old woman . <p> " Kawaii boya desu ne , " Mrs. Saito said , commenting on the cuteness of the baby . <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi carried Naoki over to her . " This is Curtis ' boy . He 's going to stay with me for a week . " Mrs. Saito , who spoke no English , made Mrs. Kawaguchi feel awkward about her Japanese , as if she were always making some grammatical error that Mrs. Saito noticed but said nothing about . <p> Mrs. Saito smiled and reached over the fence to touch the baby 's hair . " Curtis is married to the American girl ? " Mrs. Saito asked . <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi nodded . Mrs. Saito 's grandchildren were not yet married ; her bloodline was still pure . <p> " Yes , he looks like her . His eyes are so big . " <p> " Really ? " Mrs. Kawaguchi had never thought that the baby looked like Amanda . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked more Japanese than not . <p> " Oh , yes . " Mrs. Saito made a small circle with her arthritic index finger and thumb . " That big , " she said of his eyes , as if she were talking about some strangely oversized strawberries . <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi told Mrs. Saito that Naoki would be with her for the week . <p> " A week ? " She shook her head and laughed , hiding her mouth with her hand . " Young mothers today have an easy time of it , ne ? But it must be nice to have him . Too bad he ca n't stay all the time . " <p> " I suppose so , " Mrs. Kawaguchi said , turning to look at the baby , who now sat beneath the clothesline , the white sheets billowing around him . <p> The baby fell asleep while Mrs. Kawaguchi was watching television . This surprised her , since she knew Amanda had a difficult time putting him to sleep . She smoothed the fine hairs on his head . He 's better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yarn out of her basket and began to knit . <p> Here he cried less frequently . Here he slept longer . He was learning to eat by himself . It was too bad he could not stay here all the time . <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi stopped knitting . Perhaps Amanda and Curtis would let her keep the baby . They would no longer need to take him to their baby-sitter . They could visit him in the evenings and on the weekends . Amanda could practice more frequently . <p> How foolish , she thought , and began to knit again . <p> But she remembered the pinched look on his face , the way his hands reached out for Amanda whenever she crossed the room . The baby 's things could be moved into the spare bedroom . She could put up new wallpaper , sew new curtains out of fabric woven with cartoon characters . <p> There 's nothing you can do , Mas had told her . <p> But could she just leave the baby to Amanda and have him grow up like her ? Would he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against her pillow , his nostrils flaring at her scent ? <p> Curtis and Amanda would never allow it , she could hear Mas say . <p> That was probably true . Mrs. Kawaguchi looked around the room . She had redecorated ten years earlier , but it was still a dim , narrow room . What if they went somewhere else ? <p> The baby woke up crying . Mrs. Kawaguchi carried him over to her r head on the bare flesh of her shoulder . But her skin was thin with age and her collarbone jutted sharply upward into two hard points at the base of her neck , so she cradled him instead , resting his face against her sagging but soft right breast . <p> They could go away . <p> She rocked a little faster , her toes clenched . The baby 's breathing remained slow and regular . A circle of dampness spread against her skin . They could live somewhere else . Somewhere nice . He was an orphan , she might explain to Naoki years later . He would sit at the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would rest his cheek against his hand and sigh , asking what his parents were like . At those times she would show him a picture of them , taken when Naoki was just a baby . The pictures would be intact , uncreased , and the three of them would look pink and happy . They loved you very much , she would tell him . She could move somewhere warm , Arizona or Texas , perhaps . <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi stopped rocking . <p> How foolish ! she could hear Mas say . <p> Was it so foolish ? Would n't it be worse to leave the baby to Amanda ? <p> A baby belongs with her mother . She could see Mas folding his arms . <p> But I ca n't just leave him the way things are now . He 's like a kite tangled in telephone wires . He 's the twig that will fall with the first rain . <p> Think about Amanda , Mas whispered . <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi resumed her rocking . Amanda is the problem , Mrs. Kawaguchi argued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeak , and she could no longer hear what Mas had to say . <p> While standing in line at the supermarket the following day , Mrs. Kawaguchi heard a woman behind her yell , " No ! " She turned to see a blond woman grab a package of Oreo cookies from her small daughter 's hand . The daughter slapped her mother 's stomach ; the mother slapped the girl 's arm . Mrs. Kawaguchi pressed Naoki against her breast . The mother turned and saw Mrs. Kawaguchi watching her . " When they 're that age , they 're great , " she said , jerking her chin toward Naoki . " But then they grow up , like this one . " She looked back at her daughter , whose hand pressed hard upon the black moving belt , her fingers taut . Mrs. Kawaguchi smiled at the girl , but the girl did not smile back . No one , Mrs. Kawaguchi thought as she walked briskly toward her car , would blame her if she took Naoki away . <p> She would be a coward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people would not understand that . They would only look at things from the parents ' point of view . They would think about Amanda . But would Amanda really suffer ? Or would she secretly be relieved ? And what would Curtis think ? But Curtis was a man , and men left the children to their wives . Besides , Curtis was her son . He knew she was a better mother than Amanda was . She glanced back at Naoki in his car seat . He smiled at her . <p> In the last two days , Naoki had slept through the night . He was becoming better , normal , healthy . Mrs. Kawaguchi had no doubt that he would grow like the name she had given him , " Straight Tree , " as long as he lived under her care . <p> After putting the groceries away , Mrs. Kawaguchi checked her bank account . She had plenty of money left over from Mas ' insurance policy . Her Buick was five years old but had only 34,000 miles on it . She washed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They could not condemn her if she left . She was simply doing what was right for the baby . Curtis and Amanda could have another , but no , of course they would not . They should not . Some people were better off without children . In Mrs. Kawaguchi 's time , all women were expected to be mothers . But things were different these days . <p> In the evening when Curtis and Amanda next called , Mrs. Kawaguchi held the receiver to the baby 's ear and listened to them coo . " My sweetie pie , " Amanda said . Curtis explained about fish he had seen while snorkeling , schools of shimmering yellows and greens swimming in perfect formation . From a distance , they could be kinder to the baby , perhaps even loving . <p> In bed that night , Mrs. Kawaguchi decided they would go for just a year . In two weeks , she would call her daughter and ask her to look after the house . She would write a letter of explanation to Curtis . Maybe in a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They would know the baby was in good hands . She waited to hear Mas ' responses while she planned , but for the past few nights he had been silent . <p> They were ready to leave . She had watered her yard and cooked a stew from the vegetables remaining in her refrigerator . She packed food into an ice chest that Mas had used for fishing trips . The house was clean , the doors and windows locked . She loaded the suitcases into the trunk and strapped the baby into the back seat of the car . As they rolled down the driveway , Mrs. Saito waved at them , smiling . <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi headed east on the San Bernardino Freeway . As she neared East L.A. and the cemetery , she decided to make one last stop before she left . She needed to apologize to her parents-in-law and to Mas because she would not be tending their gravestones for the next year . <p> The ground was firm beneath her feet . Mrs. Kawaguchi carried only the baby , and when they reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass . Mrs. Kawaguchi relit the incense sticks that remained from her last visit and had not burned completely down . The flowers she and Amanda had arranged now drooped , already brown and withering . <p> I 'm going , Mas . She felt she needed to shake him awake . Mas ! He would not respond . She only heard the swish of passing cars , the cooing of a nearby pigeon . <p> I 'm taking the baby , Mas . <p> There was no answer . <p> She opened her eyes and waited . The baby had wandered over to a nearby gravestone with fresh flowers placed before it . Mrs. Kawaguchi watched the smoke from the incense curl and rise . She could see her face reflected in the polished surface of the granite . Beneath it , through the smoke , she could see the letters of her name . Would she in fact be buried here ? <p> She was sixty-four years old . She wondered how many more years she had left to her . Mas had died at sixty-six . She glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She must live long , twenty more years at least . <p> Ha ! <p> It was Mas , laughing at her . <p> Mrs. Kawaguchi felt relieved . She did n't have twenty more years ? <p> Mas seemed to appear in their front doorway , the light at his back , his face in shadow . Who had control over their fate ? Mas ' hands seemed to rise . <p> Perhaps not my own , Mrs. Kawaguchi argued , but at least the baby 's . <p> What do you know ? Mas said . <p> Curtis always said we were too passive , that we needed to take control sometimes . That 's what I 'm doing . Mrs. Kawaguchi suddenly remembered dancing in the internment camps . How could they have danced at such a time ? <p> So you 're going to act like them ? Mas folded his arms across his chest . Think about what Amanda was praying to me . <p> How should I know that ? Mrs. Kawaguchi asked . <p> You know , he said . Mas closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the cans . She threw them into a trash can nearby and walked over to where the baby sat . A yellow chrysanthemum petal clung to his lip . She sighed and slipped her finger into his mouth to retrieve the petal he had eaten . The baby began to cry . <p> She looked over at the spot before Mas ' gravestone , the grass crushed and a paler green where she had been , and remembered Amanda kneeling there . She did understand what Amanda wanted . Please be my mother , Amanda had been saying . <p> <p> By Jeannette K. Miyamoto <p>
