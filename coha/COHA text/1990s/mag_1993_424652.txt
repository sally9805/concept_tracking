Has a space-age technology finally come of age for civilians ? <p> In January 1994 , a new type of bus will hit the American road . Unlike conventional diesel buses , whose growling engines spew coarse black fumes , this 30-foot prototype should , if all goes well , leave little trace of its passage . No thick exhaust . No engine grind . No diesel grime . Just the thrum of its electric drive , powered by a phosphoric acid fuel cell that converts airborne oxygen and methanol-derived hydrogen into electricity and water , while emitting negligible amounts of pollutants . <p> The Department of Energy ( DOE ) will road test this bus as part of a special project that aims to reduce vehicle emissions and dependence on fossil fuels while promoting a practical form of renewable energy The first three buses , products of H Power Corp . in Belleview , N.J. , will undergo trials in Los Angeles , Chicago , and Washington , D.C. , next year , signaling a move to bring hydrogen-powered propulsion systems from government-sponsored research labs to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintains , the fuel-cell-powered buses will run with 50 percent higher fuel economy , 10 to 20 decibels less noise , and 99 percent lower emissions , spewing out carbon monoxide , nitrogen , and sulfur compounds - depending on the fuel source for the hydrogen - in amounts below the stringent standards set for ultra-low-emission vehicles in California . <p> The fuel cell - which generates electricity , heat , and water by combining hydrogen and oxygen - has been around conceptually for more than 150 years . Since the 1960s , NASA and the Defense Department have used fuel cells to supply electricity and hot water for the Gemini , Apollo , and space shuttle missions and to keep troops powered up in remote locations . But only recently have technical advances made commercial uses look feasible . Now , with companies plugging fuel cells into cars , buses , and power plants , the long-term vision of a cleaner , hydrogen-powered nation - considered unrealistic even five years ago - seems less farfetched . <p> " This is the first time since fuel cells were invented that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build demonstration plants , " says Edward Gillis , fuel-cell program manager for the Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto , Calif . " We 're finally seeing commercial fuel cells , and that just happened in the last year . " <p> Fuel cells have enormous potential . Hydrogen could easily displace fossil fuels as an energy source , if only a simply engineered system could generate electricity cheaply , safely , and reliably for homes and vehicles . In theory , fuel cells can achieve that goal . But the question is when . <p> An answer should surface soon . In transportation , for instance , Canada is road testing a fuel-cell-powered bus built by the Ballard Corp . of North Vancouver , British Columbia . Varying slightly from the H Power bus , this 32-foot demonstration vehicle , operating since March 1993 , runs on compressed hydrogen , which fuels a proton exchange membrane ( PEM ) fuel cell . By 1998 , under the auspices of the government of British Columbia , Ballard plans to build a fleet of 75-passenger , 350-mile-range commercial buses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , General Motors Corp. , at its Indianapolis-based Allison Gas Turbine Division , is working on several fuel-cell-powered passenger vehicles , ranging from compact cars to minivans . In West Palm Beach , Fla. , Energy Partners , Inc. is showing off its fuel-cell-powered Green Car . To boot , the Mazda Motor Corp . is at work on an electric prototype , powered by an 8-kilowatt PEM cell that draws its hydrogen from a metal hydride storage tank . <p> The United States will see fuel-cell testing in 1994 in power plants as well as buses . The Southern California Gas Co. plans to have 10 fuel-cell plants on-line in California by mid-1994 , lighting up a hotel in Irvine , hospitals in Anaheim and Riverside , and even the Santa Barbara county jail . California 's Pacific Gas &; Electric Co. is gearing up for a 125-kilowatt system . And Southern California Edison 's Rosemead facility will plug in a 20-kilowatt unit early next year . Other fuel-cell tests are under way in Buffalo , Pittsburgh , and Atlanta . <p> Only Japan surpasses California in large fuel-cell systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A fuel cell 's basic principles are rather simple . Electricity breaks down water into hydrogen and oxygen gases ; a fuel cell runs the reaction in reverse , forming water from hydrogen and oxygen , liberating energy In a sense , a fuel cell is just a battery that generates a charge when fed a hydrogen-rich diet . With no moving parts , a fuel cell converts chemical energy directly into electric current without intermediate mechanical steps . <p> The best cells are about twice as efficient as steam and internal combustion engines . With cogeneration systems which recover excess heat to warm buildings , boil water , or even drive additional steam generators - fuel cells can reach 65 to 80 percent efficiency , compared to 35 percent for a typical internal combustion engine . The catch , though , is to iron out engineering bugs and build a system that holds up under real-world stresses . <p> Fuel cells offer other advantages . They are modular , coming in sizes that suit demand . Typically , each flat , disk-shaped cell produces less than a volt of electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates and plugged into a system , however , the cells quickly mount in power output , from the few watts required for a flashlight to the many megawatts needed for a big city Clean and silent-running , a major power plant could hide in a basement or a trailer in a parking lot - its output of potable water , useful heat , and minuscule emissions suiting it perfectly to urban life . <p> Since Sir William Grove built the first fuel cell in 1839 , many varieties have come along , each distinguished by the electrolyte - or chief chemical conductor - used to promote the hydrogen oxidation reaction . Today , five cell types dominate research , each with strengths and weaknesses that best suit it for a particular application . <p> The phosphoric acid fuel cell is the furthest developed for commercial use . With platinum electrodes sandwiching a silicon carbide matrix , which holds the phosphoric-acid electrolyte , each cell generates two-thirds of a volt - with an efficiency of roughly 40 percent - running at 200 degrees C. Scaling up for a powerplant or down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily available carbon-containing fossil fuels . On the other hand , they generate less power per cell than other types of cells , run at lower efficiencies , and require heating to operate . Also , fuels other than pure hydrogen - such as natural gas , ethanol , or methanol - must be reformed , a process that extracts hydrogen from the organic blend of compounds . <p> Still , the phosphoric acid fuel cell is the cell of choice for uses as diverse as H Power 's bus and Tokyo 's 11-megawatt Goi power station , which serves 4,000 households . In fact , a phosphoric acid test facility at the South Coast Air Quality Management District on the outskirts of Los Angeles did so well that Southern California Gas bought 10 additional units-and is considering 10 more . Since then , International Fuel Cells , Inc. of South Windsor , Conn. , which built the facility , has picked up orders for another 50 200-kilowatt stations . <p> In contrast , PEM fuel cells use a solid polymer membrane as the electrolyte sandwiched between platinum electrodes . Many types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teflon-based film called Nafion . The chief advantages of these cells are their high power density , high efficiency , and low-temperature operation . The membranes deliver more current per square centimeter of cell , handle rapid power demands , and start up quickly at a mere 80 degrees C. They are lighter and more compact than other fuel cells , which makes them well-suited for use in small machines - whether a tape recorder or family vehicle . <p> Their chief weaknesses are a need to be kept moist and a tendency to perform poorly when carbon monoxide taints the fuel supply Currently , PEMs cost more than phosphoric acid fuel cells but show great long-term promise for anything that runs on batteries . <p> Ballard powers its bus with PEM fuel cells because of their light weight , low operating temperature strong output . For similar reasons , Energy Partners placed a 24-kilowatt stack of PEM cells in its Green Car and a 2-kilowatt stack in a prototype submersible , called PC 14 , whose fuel cell powered it on 16 test dives . Mazda , too , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel cells to small applications that H Power sells a 12-volt NoCad power pack to replace batteries in video cameras and in March 1994 will offer a spin-off version to run laptop computers . Snap a hydrogen cartridge into the fuel cell , drop the power pack into a computer 's battery compartment , and the laptop gets juice for 16 hours . <p> " We 're also working on a 200-watt unit the size of my fist , " says Joseph Maceda , vice president of H Power , calling it " the Power Brick . " An entrepreneur and fuel-cell guru , Maceda sees a future of 1-kilowatt fuel cells , no larger than microwave ovens , supplying all the electricity , heat , and hot water for single-family homes . <p> Maceda is not alone in his quest to make fuel cells easy to use . " We must find better ways to put fuel cells into simple packages , " says John Appleby , a fuel-cell researcher at Texas A &M; University in College Station . " if you need a new engine for a light plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That makes no sense . It 's the same for fuel cells . When you scale down , you must be innovative . ' <p> Among the hottest , cutting-edge designs today is the solid-oxide fuel cell . It is also literally the hottest , operating at close to 1,000 degrees C. When raised to this glowing temperature , yttrium-doped zirconium oxide conducts oxygen ions , serving as a good electrolyte . The solid oxide is sandwiched between a cathode , made of strontium-doped lanthanum manganite , and an anode , made of nickel-zirconia cermet . <p> The result : a potential powerhouse . Solid oxides offer the advantage of long-lasting , reliable electric supplies without the problems associated with corrosive liquid acids or fragile membranes . Overall , the system is simpler , with only three major components : a fuel preheater , a fuel cell , and an air preheater . Its solid ceramic structures need less maintenance than other cells . The high temperature obviates the need for precious metal catalysts-such as expensive platinum and special fuel pretreatment . <p> At the same time , the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and careful monitoring . Solid-oxide cells will probably fare best in large industrial power plants - though they may one day power large ships and submarines . Today , they cost thousands of dollars per kilowatt to build . But researchers at the Electric Power Research Institute contend that material costs could fall below $20 per kilowatt , with cell life exceeding 10 years . <p> To improve solid-oxide cells , three designs are in the works : tubes , planes , and monoliths . In each , the goal is to shape the electrodes to maximize the hydrogen-oxygen reaction . Westinghouse Electric Corp . has taken its long , thin tube-shaped cells the furthest , with test units running continuously for 40,000 hours , two 25-kilowatt units on-line in Japan , and a 100-kilowatt cogeneration unit set for 1995 plug-in by Southern California Gas in Los Angeles . <p> Testing planar electrodes are two U.S. companies - Ceramatec , Inc. in Salt Lake City , and Ztec , Inc. in Waltham , Mass. and several Japanese firms , including Fuji , Mitsubishi , and Murata . Here , thin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slender stacks . Though lower in power density than the tubes , the plates appear easier to make and operate . <p> For higher power densities , monolithic blocks of layered solid oxide show great promise . Allied-Signal Corp . is developing these many-layered fuel-cell sandwiches , which could surpass tubes and planes as the most efficient design . <p> Molten carbonate fuel cells offer another direction for large-scale industrial use . More extensively developed than solid oxides , they use a solid carbonate electrolyte - held in a ceramic and sandwiched between nickel electrodes - that becomes molten during its 650 degrees C operation . The cells ' main advantage is high efficiency - 50 to 60 percent before heat recovery for cogeneration . The high temperature , too , means little fuel pretreatment . <p> Molten carbonate cells can run directly on natural gas . On a large scale , this approach appears quite cost-effective to build and install - per-kilowatt prices may be as low as $1,000 , competitive with those of fossil-fuel turbines . <p> With two 125-kilowatt stacks being tested on-site , Energy Research Corp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant that by 1995 will power 2,000 homes in Santa Clara , Calif . Trial runs of a 70-kilowatt Energy Research unit at the Pacific Gas and Electric plant in San Ramon , Calif. , have gone well enough to convince the utility to try a bigger system . <p> Union Oil of California is readying a 250-kilowatt molten carbonate system , built by Chicago-based M-C Power , Inc . Kaiser Permanente , a health maintenance organization with headquarters in Oakland , Calif. , is trying out four 200-kilowatt phosphoric acid systems while preparing a 250-kilowatt molten carbonate plant for a San Diego medical center . <p> For the highest efficiencies of all - up to 70 percent - alkaline fuel cells have proved the winners so far . Yet these cells , which use alkaline potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte , are also the most expensive to make . NASA and the Defense Department have spent heartily on these lean , pricey systems . <p> Until recently , civilian applications for alkaline fuel cells looked preposterous . But several companies are seeking to slash production costs and design better methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impurities . Soon , even alkaline cells may jockey for position in the commercial fuel-cell market . <p> The problem of storing hydrogen has plagued fuel-cell advocates from the start . A highly reactive , explosive gas , hydrogen does not lend itself to safe containment . Engineering advances , though , have improved that picture . Other than compressing hydrogen in canisters or cooling it to a liquid , the gas can be extracted as needed from hydrogen-rich compounds , such as methane or ethanol . <p> Newer systems attempt to hold hydrogen in a metal hydride matrix or activated carbon . As water holds hydrogen well , a more venturesome tack tried by H Power involves controlling the oxidative reduction - rusting - of sponge iron in a cycle that liberates hydrogen as needed . Meanwhile , at the University of California , Riverside , researchers are splitting water molecules with sunlight , using a 12-cell electrolysis unit hooked to a 3.5-kilowatt photovoltaic array . <p> The major disadvantage of fuel cells this seeming panacea for energy production - stems from engineering hurdles rather than inherent system weaknesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Until recently , they 've been too expensive to build and operate , costing upwards of $3,500 per kilowatt versus the $1,000 to $2,000 cost of conventional fossil-fuel turbines . <p> But lately the economic picture has changed . Better materials and production methods now make fuel cells competitive with gas and oil generators , especially if the expense of an electric grid figures into the equation . Overhead power lines cost $50,000 to $1 million per mile to build , plus maintenance expenses . Fuel cells could potentially make power lines obsolete , with small modular systems running neighborhoods and individual homes . <p> In fact , DOE is studying the feasibility of fuel cells for commercial and residential buildings , according to Ronald J. Fiskum , a DOE fuel-cell program manager . " We 're not looking to reinvent the wheel , " he says , " but to see the best way to integrate fuel cells into residential and commercial buildings . Micro-cogeneration - supplying heat and power - is a natural . " <p> Lest fuel cells seem like the final answer to U.S. energy needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers must still leap . Cells still suffer material degradation . The life span of commercial stacks must exceed five sometimes 10 - years to offset the initial capital expense . Current output must hold up steadily for long stretches . And consumers must get accustomed to a hydrogen-based power supply <p> Fuel-cell advocates have heralded their solution before . However , where big talk once provoked skepticism , it now calls forth construction contracts . <p> " Virtually everyone agrees we should move from fossil-fuel dependence toward renewable energy sources , " says Martin Gutstein , director of the Fuel Cell Institute in Washington , D.C. " But with fuel cells there 's a vicious circle . You ca n't get cost down until production comes up , and you ca n't get production up until the cost comes down . The Japanese have taken action here . We 've done very little . Now , perhaps , we 'll see a turnaround in this country " <p> PHOTOS ( 2 ) : Energy Partners ' Green Car carries a PEM fuel cell in its trunk for power , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a phosphoric acid fuel cell stacked in the bus ' rear .
