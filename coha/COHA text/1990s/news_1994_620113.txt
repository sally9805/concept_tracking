<p> The game was one-on-none , full court . Bobby Hurley would start at one end of the St. Anthony 's High School gym , make his move , make his hoop , take it out and head for the other side . Back and forth , back and forth , no spectators , no noise . Just Bobby and his father , like it used to be , back to the simpler days , the dad running the son until he could n't run anymore . <p> The clock would be set for five minutes . No timeouts , no breaks , no loafing . From end to end Bobby would run , testing the shoulder , the knee , the ribs , the lung that was ripped from its moorings . After five minutes , his father would give him a break : one minute , no exceptions . This would go on for 60 , 75 , 90 minutes . As long as Bobby could go , then longer , the silence broken only by the sounds of Bobby breathing and the ball bouncing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on that nearly empty court , in the stifling heat of the New Jersey summer . They were watching , judging , doubting . They 've always been there . The same guys who said he was too small , too frail , too white . They did n't have to be there in person ; they were hovering in the air and in the mind . <p> This is how Bobby Hurley came back . He had physical therapists and sports psychologists and medical specialists , but the key to the whole thing is a high school gym in Jersey City , where everybody talks like he does and thinks like he does . He returned to the nest , as it were , to a family that views basketball as sustenance . <p> As Bob Hurley , the father , says : " This is a great story . It 's a story for every person in the country who is coming back from an injury of any kind . He came back to the point where he 's a professional athlete again . That can tell everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sacramento Kings uniform . He scored 21 points last Friday in an exhibition game . He will start the season in the starting lineup . Ten months ago , he was nearly dead . On the night of December 12 , less than two months into his rookie year , his sport-utility vehicle collided with a station wagon driven by a Sacramento house painter . The accident occurred on a desolate strip of asphalt near Arco Arena , and Hurley was flung 100 feet from his vehicle , into a water-filled ditch by the side of the road . <p> He had 12 different injuries . He underwent eight hours of surgery and was in intensive care for a week . The injury rundown read like a page from Gray 's Anatomy : left shoulder , right knee , several ribs , back . Both lungs collapsed , one of them separating from the trachea . For the first time in his life , basketball was not a consideration . Survival was , though . Survival was the only consideration , and it was in doubt . <p> And now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in perpetual motion , again a professional athlete . Four months ago he was struggling to run a mile in 10 1/2 minutes . His muscle mass was dissolved . His stamina was gone . His basketball skills had atrophied . <p> " Back when I started rehabilitation , I did n't know it would be possible to be back here this soon , " Bobby says . " The state my body was in . . . I do n't know . Now I 'm beyond wherever I could imagine being . " <p> Now there are no outward signs of what happened last December 12 . The gray still runs in half-moons under his eyes , the skin is still gymnasium-tan . The coach's-son instincts for the game are there : always knowing where somebody is on the court , even if they themselves are n't quite sure . <p> " We would do a ballhandling series , " says Bob Hurley . " A lot of it is hand-eye coordination and hand quickness . Bobby did ' em all , but he was n't sharp on a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all the things he was n't sharp on the week before . That was probably the moment I knew it was possible . " <p> There are scars inside , of course , deep ones . <p> UNABLE TO DRIVE A CAR <p> Sometimes he ca n't drive a car . Somebody might cut him off on the freeway or do some other stupid thing , and Bobby will think : Forget it ; it 's not worth it . He 'll pull over to the side of the road and let somebody else in the car take the wheel . <p> " The recovery is as much mental and psychological as anything else , " Bobby says . " I needed to get rid of the feelings I had . I could n't have gone through the rehabilitation here ( in Sacramento ) . I would n't have made any progress . A lot of it was just remembering where I was before . " <p> The stories of Bob Hurley and his sons always had a tinge of The Great Santini to them . The father is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful high school programs in the country . His sons , Bobby and Danny , got no special treatment . One story  --  possibly apocryphal but indicative nonetheless  --  goes like this : Bob once threw Bobby out of a practice because he was his son , then looked at Danny and threw him out , too , because he was Bobby 's brother . <p> " I 'd do everything to them , " Bob Hurley has said . " I 'd knock them off balance when they were shooting . I 'd talk junk to them . Anything to make them tougher . " <p> Bobby says now there 's a good chance he would n't be ready to start the season if he had n't had his father 's help . A hired hand might have been too easy on him , too sympathetic . His father had a different agenda ; or , as Bob says , " Bobby was n't really ready for what I was going to do to him . " <p> " One of the big things the doctor told us with Bobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bob says . " If he was down or having a bad day , we had to stress the positive . I 'm known to really push the kids . To be positive just was n't natural for me . " <p> HURLEY WANTS PAST IN PAST <p> The trial of Daniel Wieland , the driver of the station wagon , ended with the jury deadlocked , 10-2 , in favor of convicting him of reckless driving . The police said Wieland was driving without his lights on that strip of desolate asphalt ; Wieland and his lawyer say that would have been impossible , and that Hurley eased through a stop sign and caused the accident . Whatever happened , Bobby wants it to go away . A retrial is possible , but Hurley does n't want to go through it again . <p> " Trying to relive every moment of that night is almost impossible , " he says . " It just brings up the feelings and all the bad memories . It sets me backward . <p> " There 's really nothing they can do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone through the last year . " <p> Bobby was initially forgiving to Wieland . Now his eyes acquire a harder glint when the topic is raised . <p> " When I was as close to death as I was , I was just extremely happy to be alive , " he says . " That 's all that mattered , and I ca n't really describe what that was all about . It was the main reason I made some of those comments . Now I look back at it and think , ' How many months did it take for me to get back ? ' I see it a different way , I guess . " <p> BACK IN LESS THAN A YEAR <p> You could make the case that no other professional athlete  --  except perhaps a race-car driver  --  has gone through similar circumstances and made it back in less than a year . Normally , a torn anterior-cruciate ligament takes a year of recovery , and Hurley had one of those , too . <p> " It seems like I 've always had some type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year at Duke , we lost the title game by 30 to UNLV . . . . But this is big adversity , nothing like anything else . <p> " It was a real traumatic experience , and it really changed my life . People who know me  --  my family and close friends  --  say they 've seen a change in me . It 's made me realize how precious life is . " <p> These words are relayed to his father , 3,000 miles away . This is the cue for Bob Hurley to say something poignant , or philosophical , or at least fatherly . Maybe something about cycles repeating themselves , or about getting the chance to teach his son to play the game one more time . <p> Bob Hurley might be feeling those things , but he sure as hell is n't going to say them . <p> " I still think of him as a 23-year- old meathead , " he says , laughing . " I 'm sure there 's some maturation that 's taken place , but I 'm not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @
