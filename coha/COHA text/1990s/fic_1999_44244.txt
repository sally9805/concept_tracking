Some of the most basic needs are among the least tangible . <p> Ark Ascension orbited hundreds of miles above the mutagen-infested Earth . Rotation created a one-grav interior in the seven-mile-long , seven-mile-diameter tube where genetically uncorrupted animals roamed 150 square miles of sculpted , planted and artificially fit landscape . Martin tended the sun . During the day he plotted ionization graphs , watched for ultraviolet and infrared variances , checked thermal output against projected goals and wrote a report about the largely automated processes . He checked the news one more time . The wolf had not whelped . At dusk he left his east-end office where stars slowly revolved in one window and seven miles of bluffs , hills , and trees stood in the other . Pine smells and wet leaves met him . Gravelly dirt crunched beneath his shoes . The door 's seams vanished into the wall . He took a deep breath and shivered . The plasma sun dimmed in the west : an Ascension sunset . The sun did n't disappear below a horizon , but reached the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooled . A mile above Martin , a hazy moon flickered on to start its night-long trip to the western end . He rubbed his upper arms , wishing he 'd worn a coat . He checked his wrist monitor linked to the plasma track and nodded . The moon produced no heat , but it lighted the interior which otherwise would be black as a cave , without a single star to break the inky tapestry . To the north , a wolf howled . Martin tried to spot it . He wondered if it was the pregnant wolf 's mate . The land sloped up both left and right , but the trees slanted with the slope until they appeared to be horizontal spikes poking from distant cliffs . Then the cliffs continued in a great arc , completing the world 's roof above him . Beyond the moon in the clear evening air , he thought he saw movement . Deer , maybe , or elk ; there was a small herd of each , but at this distance it was unlikely . Probably shifting shadows . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand roamed the artificial environment . A dozen biologists observed them , of course , and geneticists tested for mutagens , ever vigilant for contagion . Martin did n't see the scientists much . Their haunted faces and creepy depression bothered him . They acted as if the Earth had died . " Catastrophic species shift " they called it . Nothing remained the same , except here in Ark Ascension and the four other Arks just like it . Photograph <p> Martin avoided the crew , fifteen couples , twenty-three unmarried adults and thirteen children . He spent his time at the zero-g axis , fine-tuning the sun , tweaking magnetic containments , experimenting with plasma physics . Sunset and moonrise brought him to the surface . A zoologist , Dr. Kette , the only single parent on board , and her daughter , Robyn , used this observation area too . The door 's mechanical whisper behind told him they were there . " It 's cold , Mom , " said Robyn , an eightyear-old whose rounded cheeks , dark eyes , and serious expression mirrored her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plants need the seasons to stay healthy . " Robyn leaned against her mother 's leg . " It makes me sad . The trees are bare . " " Not the evergreens . " The sun 's dull remnant winked out . Only the moon cast light , a cool , silvered sheen that shimmered the grass . Martin took a few steps away from the wall . If he did n't look up , the illusion nearly fooled him , a full moon on foothills . In the hollows , fog eddied and the temperature dropped . Frost would soon coat rock and branch , bush and earth . " Ca n't you make the sun warmer , Martin ? " said Robyn . " Ca n't we always have summer ? " Surprised that she 'd spoken to him  --  generally their evening pilgrimages were silent-he said , " Most of the heat comes from the ground .... " " As I 've explained , " said Bit Kette . She sounded sad too . Martin knew that like the other women she wanted to have more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one knew if her babies would be born human . She did n't know if she 'd been isolated in time . " There 's no snow , " said Robyn . " How can we have winter without snow ? " " We 're in a spacecraft . It ca n't snow here . We 'll still have Christmas though . We 'll decorate the apartment . " Dr. Kette did n't sound convinced " We do n't need snow for Christmas . " Robyn stamped her foot . It was halfhearted . Martin knew she could n't really throw a tantrum . She was too nice a child for that . " We ca n't even put up colored fights ! Four days until Christmas ! No snow and no lights . " Robyn 's tears were real . Dr. Kette sat on the ground beside her . I miss them , too . " Embarrassed , Martin moved further away He 'd never had a family Too much lab time . But the image of Robyn leaning against her mother affected him . He wanted to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Kette cried also . Mother and child displaced , no different from the animals wandering beyond . After a bit , Martin approached , touched Dr. Kette on the shoulder . " You guys will freeze if you stay out here . " The woman looked up at him . " We really are a long , long way from home . " Martin could n't do anything about snow . At 5,800 feet to the Ark 's center , there was n't air enough for clouds . Winter ground fog was common though . In the fall and spring , when the transition between the day 's heat , the night 's temperature drop and the humidity was just right , it drizzled for a few minutes in the morning , but no snow . He thought about Robyn crying . A crew meeting the next morning discussed the upcoming holiday . A party was proposed . Debate followed , a dispirited affair The head of research argued , " Even if we are in exile , we can celebrate-we need a celebration . " " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the head of the medical unit , his tab coat meticulously pressed , his hair combed straight back and tight against his head , like a helmet . " It 's ghoulish for us to be merry while our families on Earth struggle . " Martin sat in the back of the conference room . He thought about the deterioration of the news . Before they 'd left , the worst of the mutagen births clustered in pockets . California suffered , as did Canada 's western coast and Alaska . Martin had heard stories of monstrous polar bear cubs , mewling in the snow , hairless , deformed , abandoned by their mothers . The Midwest and the east were untouched . So the pattern continued the world over : some areas hit hard , others not . The mutagen spread slowly ; it had taken twenty years to get this far For twelve years the Arks were built , and then , a year ago January , were populated with animals and crew from uncontaminated areas . The crew came from areas with no unnatural births . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutagen 's progress accelerated . No place was untouched . From the Ark they watched the fear rise . It built . Cities burned , and there were no uncorrupted births . Fish or fowl , beast or man , the babies were not right . Most died , but more horribly , some lived . The crew could hardly bear to look at the pictures . Against the back wall , the children sat . Maybe they are the last young ones we 'll see , thought Martin . Maybe they 're the end . Someone said , " The animals are sterile . Even the rabbits have had no litters . Not even lab mice . We have n't saved anything by coming here . We should be in fully equipped laboratories searching for a cure . Running away solved nothing . " People muttered , while the captain waited for new comments . Dr Kette said , " We expected most animals would lose a breeding season . That 's a well-documented effect of dislocation . It 's too soon to tell , and there is the wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Wolf pups would prove nothing . Even if they 're good , it 's only a matter of time before the mutagen breaks out here too . " " We do n't know that , " offered Dr. Kette . " Yes you do ! " thundered Roam . " The women know . We have been here eleven months , and there are twentyseven women among us . Not one pregnancy . The women know we have no reason to celebrate . " Martin glanced again at the children . Robyn sat near the door , holding a crumpled drawing . A part of it showed through , a Christmas tree with ornaments and lights . As the argument grew , she twisted the paper tight . Her eyes were red , but she never cried . She looked lost . In the end , they voted for no official celebration . later , in his zero-g work station , Martin adjusted the magnetic fields holding the ionized gasses in place . The biologists suggested the animals might feel more at home if the moon waxed and waned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers . When finished , he contemplated the length of the Ark . In the middle , the sun glared , intolerably bright , nearly a third of its daily distance across the sky . Around it , trees pointed toward the axis ; cliffs , hills , bluffs , stretches of meadow , streams ( water pumped from the lakes at their bottoms to springs at their tops ) surrounded the light . An unbroken landscape , a whole one-no horizon separating any one part from another . He found this image comforting , a perfect metaphor for life 's unity , and he could n't feel Dr. Roam 's despair , or any of the others ' . Tinking of the children , Martin wrote invitations to a Christmas party at sunset , Christmas Eve . He set the place , the central-Ark observation area , then sent them . He turned back to his equipment . There was work to be done ; he had a party to prepare . Martin arrived early , an hour before sunset . He took a tube transport that traveled on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies to a flat , sandy clearing overlooking a small cirque . At the hollow 's bottom a lake reflected darkly . A startled mountain goat scrambled from the water 's edge , tumbling small rocks as it leaped to the top . Most splashed through thin ice into the lake , and the goat disappeared into a boulder field . He 'd pressed the kitchen to make candy canes , and hung them from leafless bushes surrounding the clearing . As he hung the last one , the early guests stepped out of the elevator . Four year-old Elise , the youngest child aboard , found the first candy . She held the cane out for everyone to see , and soon the other children busied themselves finding more of the sweets , even the Nguyen twins , who were thirteen . Talk was muted . Almost mournful . Martin remembered Dr. Roam 's pronouncement , " We have no reason to celebrate . " The adults clustered around the radiant heaters , warming their hands . Robyn solemnly poked through brittle branches , looking for the last of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mom ? " Robyn tucked a cane into her shirt pocket . She looked down , scuffing dirt with the toe of her shoe . " She went to see the wolves . She 's been gone all day . I told her it was Christmas Eve , but she had to work . " " Ah , that 's too bad . " Martin gave her another candy cane from the extras he kept in a pouch . She added it to her collection . " Thank you . I 'll save them until later . " " There 's hot chocolate in the thermoses , " he said . Robyn sighed and headed for the crowd . Now that the candy had been found , all stood near the heaters . Hilliert , an older biologist called his son , Brad . " We really have to go , Martin . This was nice of you , but I do n't think we 're in the spirit . " Other scientists nodded their heads . " It 's cold , and we ought to get the kids home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the western wall and begun its dimming cycle . Chill stung his cheeks . " I have a surprise , but we have to wait a few minutes . There 's a thermos with hot chocolate that 's mostly rum in my bag over there , if you want to break that out . " Hilliert raised his eyebrows and put his hand on his son 's head . " We 'll stay a bit longer , Brad . Maybe we could sing a carol . " Gradually the sun faded out . Long shadows became less and less distinct , and soon the only light came from the heaters glowing orange in the clearing 's middle . Martin stood behind the circle of parents and children , hands thrust deep into his pockets . Robyn tucked her hands into her armpits and did n't join the singing . They finished two verses of " Good King Wenceslas " before someone said , " It 's pretty darned dark out here , Martin . Where 's the moon ? " He checked his wrist monitor . A counter clicked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light appeared . " What is that ? " the same voice asked . Martin turned . At the west end , a green light flickered on . The scientists and their children turned from the heaters and looked up . The first two fights floated quickly to the center of the sky to stop a few degrees apart like a red and green star . Then new lights appeared at each end , a blue one to the east , and an orange to the west . Soon , a line of colored points reached from end to end , much smaller than the moon or sun , not nearly as bright . Martin barely made out his own hands in the diffuse light , and then , following the program he designed , they began to pulse individually from bright to dark and back again The elevator door opened , its white light silhouetting Dr. Kette as she stepped out . Robyn cried out , " Mom , look . Christmas lights ! " The door closed , and only the colored lights illuminated the world . A hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? - Robyn said . " Yes . " " Mommy came . She came to your party . " Vaguely Martin could make out Dr. Kette standing beside him ; he mostly saw the colors in her eyes as she looked UP . " This is lovely , Martin " They stood for a long time . Behind them one of the kids said , " Let 's sing " Silent Night , ' " and they did ; their voices filled the clearing . " Did you see the wolves ? " asked Martin . " Yes , " said Dr. Kette . She held her daughter 's hand . Their breath steamed in the frigid air " The mother whelped , " she said . " Four perfect pups . They were mutagen free . " Martin could n't tell if she was crying . In the darkness in the sky beyond , he saw glitters like stars , and realized the icy ponds and streams on the roof of the world reflected the display . It was an effect he 'd never seen . The moon did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed land and vegetation , but in this light , there were sparkles , red ones and green , blue and orange . Multicolored tinsel strings ; long , glass-blue lines shading into the orange of frozen creeks ; red fog rising into green , rising into blue ; green snowy meadows blushing red then yellow ; orange mountain ridges transformed ; star glisters blinking everywhere-a thousand stars over Bethlehem-shards of Christmas light , changing in the changing night . The wolves were born whole . He 'd never seen the Ark so beautiful .
