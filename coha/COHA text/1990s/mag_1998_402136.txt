A taskmaster turns kids into dancers the old-fashioned way making them earn it Photograph " In dance , we 're all equal , " says choreographer Eliot Feld ( with Jassen Virolas in New York City ) . // It is a crisp , bright afternoon in Manhattan , but inside a stuffy 2,500-square-foot studio on lower Broadway , a line of young dancers is sweating profusely to strains of Beethoven . As lithe bodies fly through the air , Eliot Feld takes a drag on his cigarette , claps his hands to the tempo , then halts the pianist . " You must support the girl ! " he barks at one young male dancer , then adds , " I 'm going to sue you for nonsupport . " The joke momentarily eases the tension ; next time the pair get it right . But when the dancers take five , another teenage boy whispers to a reporter , " He 's just being nice because you 're here . " Of course , being nice is n't the point . Being professional is .

Only a lucky few will eventually be chosen for his professional dance troupe , also called Ballet Tech , but Feld is n't about to lower his exacting standards . " In real life , there is no remedial course , no tutoring , " he says . " In real life , you just get fired . " In fact , Feld rocked the New York City dance establishment during the 1996-97 season by disbanding his professional troupe and starting a new one stocked mostly with students from his program . " It had been my notion for a very long time , " he says , " that the company would reflect the school . " At first the brash move puzzled critics , but Ballet Tech has since won a loyal folowing for its raw , innovative productions . " Feld is a much underrated choreographer , " says Terry Teachout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He has n't gotten the credit he deserves because he does n't do what people expect him to .

" Photograph Auditions begin in the second grade , says Feld. to give the child a chance to think , ' ' 1 love this . " // Feld , 56 , was bucking expectations long before starting his own company . At age 11 , with little formal experience , he made his professional debut as the Prince in George Balanchine 's The Nutcracker . At 16 , while still enrolled at New York 's High School for the Performing Arts , he won the role of a gang member in both the Broadway and movie versions of West Side Story .

" He is a real perfectionist , " says Christine Sarry , a former Feld dancer who now teaches at the school . " He really wants what he wants . " What Feld originally wanted was a traditional dance academy to supply his fledgling company . " We took ads , we had teachers , " he recalls , " but no talented people came . " Then one morning , while riding the subway to work , Feld saw a group of elementary school kids giddily embarking on a field trip . " They were so excited to be going somewhere , " he says . " And I thought , There ! That 's where my dancers are-in the city 's schools . With hundreds and thousands of , third and fourth graders each year and admit between 900 and 1,000 ( about 65 percent of them boys ) .

" It 's a constant struggle between school and dance , " says one teen dancer . " You have to keep a cool head . " The school 's sink-or-swim philosophy stems from Feld 's own childhood experiences . The only child of Leo Unker , a garment worker who died in a car crash when Eliot was 6 , and his wife , Alice , 84 , a travelgroup organizer for teens , he grew up in a tough Manhattan neighborhood . " If I had n't been a dancer , " he says with a laugh , " I would have been a felon . " Photograph // For his students , making the final cut is a struggle , but worth it .

" " But once accepted , he never missed a lesson . His persistence paid off : Feld took him under his wing and in 1986 hired him as one of his company 's professional dancers . Says Gibson , who left in 1997 to pursue freelance dance opportunities : " Sometimes I feel like I was fathered by Eliot . " Indeed , Feld , a bachelor who lives alone , often sounds like a parent to his charges . What motivates such devotion ? " It 's kind of enlightened selfinterest , " he says . " I need them ; they need me . " And though none of his dancers has yet achieved wide fame or great fortune , Feld has no doubts about what he , and they , have accomplished . " I 'm sure that each of them has benefited in some way from being here , " he says . " They get a sense of a world that has opportunities-a sense that people care .
