Chapter 1pressing ? " As evidence , she now hefted the reader so that it fell splayed from her palm , a fat textbook covered with the bored graffiti of her predecessors , so heavy it appeared to be taxing her frail wrist just to hold it up . Outside , snow fell . Not the snow of November or December , which portended Christmas , nor the snow of January or February , which meant skiing , but the snow of March , that defeated , dreary , superfluous month no one could love . Weather and room and subject matter were all gloomy . Birdy had smoked a joint over lunch break with her colleague Jesus Morales , and that , combined with the pregnant girl 's question , the snow , and the body odor of twenty-three teenagers , made her feel hopeless for humanity . She ached for the girl anyway , so unprepared for what awaited her . Around the teachers ' lounge , her plight had become a watershed : those who sympathized and those who judged . As the youngest teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students . Birdy drew a big breath as if to blow out candles ; her tongue still tasted dryly of pot . She explained to her senior lit class that , in the first place , the stories and poems were n't all depressing , and , in the second place , did n't tragic feelings linger longer ? Would there be anything much to say about a happy day ? Her students studied her , thinking of a thousand things to say about a happy day . A few of the girls thought she had nice clothes ; the boys appreciated her long legs and long hair and the way she took jokes well . But they could n't quite muster the enthusiasm she seemed to expect . Accustomed to Spanish pronunciation , they called novels " nobbles , " reducing them to rabbit food . They all hopped to action in other classes , inspired by threats , eager to keep athletic eligibility , avidly cheating if necessary . But Ms. Birdy Stone , lover of sad literature , held no particular power ; her class was good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students develop a wrinkle , a space between her and them , an annoyance that was new to her . I 'm getting old , she thought dejectedly . They 'll all stay seventeen , year in , year out , but soon I 'll be old enough to be their mother . Everyone sat waiting for the bell , which was n't a bell at all but a buzz like an oven timer . Inside the school it was unnaturally hot ; they were done . The buzzer buzzed and they went away . All small towns are not alike . Having seen one , you had not seen them all . Everyone did not know everyone else 's business , and the people were neither friendlier nor more genuine , the lifestyle not purer  --  just duller . Birdy Stone had lived for nineteen months in Pinetop , New Mexico , and still the old adages were being debunked . She 'd come from a big city , Chicago , and thought a high percentage of its inhabitants would fit right into Pinetop , far , far better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as temporarily installed here , not like a tourist but like a reporter on a story , a missionary on a mission , never mind that she could not name her cause . It seemed she was looking for something . She did not worry about the renewal of her teaching contract because its being terminated would finally give her a reason to pack up and flee . She was twenty-nine years old and unwilling to consider this place the backdrop for the rest of her life . As an excuse for being a community , Pinetop had used mining and then timber industries . But that was over . Now those attendant structures hulked emptily on the hillsides as eyesores . Some nights they seemed to sneak closer , big boxes full of the void , square black windows and doors like holes punched in for a peek . The town had burned down twice in its one-hundred-year history , so there remained no interesting architecture , no quaint clapboard buildings or stately brick ones , nothing but the mountain of toxic mine tailings and the ravaged hillside where once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Apaches ran a gambling casino , and there was a large horse-racing trade in the vicinity , but neither of those lucrative businesses did much for Pinetop , although every Pinetop merchant sold T-shirts and postcards advertising both . Many of the locals seemed to think their town was about to be discovered by that most profitable of enterprises , tourism ; little specialty shops popped up like flowers every spring  --  espresso bar , chocolate shoppe , Christmas ornament boutique  --  opening cheerfully with banners and bargains only to slowly wither over the summer and fall , the merchandise grown dusty , the clerk gloomy , the owner cynical , the crepe paper shabby and saggy , until the store-front stood desolate once more . Failure seemed its own thriving industry , like death . On the highways leading in and out the national franchises lined up , jockeying for attention , pushed together like snap beads , the same eye-catching toy colors , red , yellow , blue , green . People in Pinetop considered it a coup when a fast-food chain selected their town for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Box and their Kentucky Fried . For the convenience of a drive-through window , they 'd forsaken the downtown cafe , Dora 's , in favor of McDonald 's . Quaintness did not interest them . Charm was a little nothing you wore jingling on your wrist . Plus , the wind blew . The mountains sat in such a way that a nearly constant wind howled through ; pointed pine trees , those left standing , listed north-eastward as if yearning to give up and sail off , arrows into space . The gritty tailings , heaped in a barren yellow dune at the western end of town , flew overhead on particularly bad days , snicking against the window glass , thickening the air like flung salt , settling over the streets and yards and roofs . In the winter , it was snow that blanketed the ground , drifted against the east and north sides of houses , banked icy buttresses before windows and doors . From the Windy City herself , Birdy should have been accustomed to the relentlessness . She 'd hated the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the winter , its taunting tornadoes in the summer . But in Chicago you could huddle in doorways , escape into basements , dash between the high-rises , duck into steamy delis or crowded appliance shops . You could take solace in the fact that the wind swept away the litter and smog . The city fathers acknowledged its eminent domain ; they heated the El stops and burrowed out parking lots underground ; they called themselves Hog Butcher to the World , and girded their loins . Here , people pretended the wind was not incessant . They walked out of their houses with tentative grips on their possessions , their hats and umbrellas and trash sacks . Their skirts flew up and their television antennas snapped , laundry defied the line . Both this year and last , everyone assured Birdy it was highly unusual , all this wind . They went around being astonished by it , exclaiming . She was suspicious of their wonder . She lived in a trailer , which rocked in the breeze like a bread box . Her neighbors owned aerodynamic A-frames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , or trailers such as her own , sitting atop concrete blocks and pink fiberglass bales , roofs dotted with old tires like sliced olives on saltines . It was not uncommon in Pinetop for houses to come rolling in on the highways  --  and , conversely , for automobiles to rest in fields among the flowers and cattle . Everywhere you looked there were signs reminding you not to dump : DO NOT DUMP , as if you might be tempted , otherwise , to unload all of your garbage , right here , right now . Birdy 's street , she learned after the first winter , was situated where the prostitutes used to live in tiny shacks called cribs . The remaining cribs looked like fancy , albeit dilapidated , doghouses , a whole vacant row of them , six places , each no larger than a mattress . This was the side of town where people owned roosters and motorcycles ; in the mornings , they crowed and roared . Property was marked by the use of cyclone fencing or scrawny chicken wire , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with colored water , set wobbling on the ground in rows like giant jelly beans , grotesque Easter eggs the same faded pastel shades , p ink , aqua , lilac , daffodil . What trespass were they capable of discouraging ? The backside of Main Street , Birdy 's neighborhood was so close to where Mt . Ballard and Mt . Ajax met that it did not see sunshine for the months of December and January . Farther , a kind of stream ran through , making things chillier . It probably had a name , this shivering water , but Birdy did not know it . The other side of town was the sunny side , and that 's where the reputable people had always lived on a gently sloping , brightly lit hillside . Their streets bisected the incline like bleachers , on each row rested the square facades of two-story bungalows , barrackslike , militantly overlooking the spectacle of Main Street , and , behind it , Birdy 's squalid turf . Only the upstanding could keep their balance over there ; the rest slid , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was located in the bleachers , a 1950s yellow-brick building designed like a prison or mental institution : massive , functional , impenetrable as well as inescapable . But Birdy had moved here in a fit of defiant self-pity , whimsical exile , so her grim living arrangement suited her . Of course her side of town was where the hookers and the poor foreign miners had lived . Of course her pipes would freeze and burst ; of course her gas bill would skyrocket  --  her tin home leaked its heat like an old-fashioned pie cabinet . And in the humid late summer , the mosquitoes would descend along the riverbank to suck blood from whatever lived there . " This town , " Birdy would say to her friend , " it depresses me . " " Sadness , " Jess would agree , mildly , without emotion , the way their students said bummer . The symbol for grief , the shorthand recognition of others ' pain . Jess had grown up in Pinetop . For a few weeks Birdy had thought he was named Zeus . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Affably , since he was homegrown . " Hey , Zeus . " That 's how naive she was concerning her new state and its culture . The Spanish language still scared her ; she was convinced people were discussing her as they chattered with each other in it , going fast just to thwart her . At a critical juncture , Jess had fled Pinetop for Albuquerque , which passed as the area 's big city . There , he developed sophistication and a sense of humor , became gay without suffering trauma , then returned , having maintained good relations with his former teachers , his parents , his old friends . Birdy thought Jess was nothing short of remarkable ; she wished her family and hometown liked her as much as his liked him . The only snag in his life was his need to speed off to Albuquerque every few weeks to spend a weekend . There , he picked up men , visited clubs , wore women 's clothes , ate pills like candy . Then he was back , in his saggy innocuous pants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; was that his secret ? It cheered you up just to see his shining , apple-cheeked face . In Pinetop , he joined the fan clubs advertised on cable television and waited for UPS to bring him esoteric old movies that the local video store did not stock . He smoked clove cigarettes and listened to Barbra Streisand on obsolete vinyl albums . Birdy relished his friendship ; in a larger town , it would n't have been possible . In a larger town , he would be a member of a group that excluded her , a group two notches hipper than she , but here , in little Pinetop , they became pals . " A mom called me , " Birdy told Jess one day when they were alone in the teachers ' lounge . " Not a mom ! " " Mark Anthony 's mom . " " That Mark Anthony , " Jess said . " What a babe . " Besides his famous name , Birdy had n't particularly noticed the boy , who sat dutifully in her Social Problems and American Values section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sock Probs and Am Vals , as if it concerned car engines , a course rotated among them ; nobody enjoyed teaching it , too much reading was involved , and all of it dry , dry , dry . Birdy had caused a stir by introducing fiction texts to the curriculum , Invisible Man , To Kill a Mockingbird , The Scarlet Letter , those glum nobbles . " What could she want ? " Birdy fretted . " You use the Lord 's name in vain lately ? " " I think I might have said ' suck , ' as in ' Your research essays suck . ' " She hated conflict ; she was prepared to confess to anything . " You have a habit of blaspheming the American government . " " I know . " " You 're in trouble , girl . " " A mom , a mom , a mom . " Birdy laid her head on the lounge table . " Do n't you think Mark Anthony 's a babe ? " Jess asked , laying his head down across from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped , the way they did when Birdy seemed to be missing something obvious . He made a grin , which , up-ended , Birdy saw was a perfect rectangle , teeth like a package of peppermint Chiclets . " I do n't trust babes , " Birdy told him . " Interesting , " he said . Mrs. Pack , the school secretary , walked into the lounge then and regarded them suspiciously , as she always did , as if Jess were still the student he 'd once been  --  impish jailbait  --  and as if Birdy were the bad influence . They could not be up to anything good , with their faces on the tabletop . Other teachers called her by her first name , Edith , but Jess and Birdy always said , " Good morning , Mrs. Pack " like brats . This , Birdy decided , was the way she would stay young , by refusing to grow up . Mrs. Pack told Birdy that her two o'clock appointment had just called to confirm . " Wah ! " " Isadora Anthony " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jess asked , " or a bad one ? " Mrs. Pack pointedly did not answer , as if ignoring him might cure his irritating conduct . " I believe she said she was meeting with you , but our connection was bad . Is there weather ? " All three of them looked toward the high windows , which revealed nothing certain . " It 's her phone , " Birdy said . Yesterday there had been hissing on the line  --  cheap receiver , thick walls , or the simple interference of the infernal wind  --  then the woman had said , " Missus Stone ? " in a long southern interrogative . " Miz Stone , " Birdy had answered , emphasizing it the way she hated her students to do , as if she were already an old maid . Mrs. Anthony said , " Oh . " More hissing . " Miz Stone ? I was wondering if we could have a meeting ? It 's not about your class . It 's another thing . " She said " another " as if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed out of alarm , out of curiosity ; now she invented a scenario in which Jess and Mrs. Anthony 's son Mark had become illicit lovers . Her heart thumped with the thrill of such a transgression  --  and someone else 's transgression , not hers . Then she formulated her own sober response : despite the fact that Jess was her friend and that Mark was a mature senior , Faculty Shalt Not Date Students . She suspected it would come between her and Jess , when she had to draw the line , thereby ruining the only real fun she had in town . Was n't that just like love ? To throw a monkey wrench into a perfectly good friendship ? " It 's been real , " Jess said as he left the lounge . " I 'll never forget you , you loser , you . " " Scum , " Birdy answered blandly , " freak , " while Mrs. Pack recoiled . Mark Anthony 's mother had arranged to come to school during what was supposed to be Birdy 's planning period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daydreaming over a bag of Fritos and a Fresca , feet on a stack of blue books . Mark must have been cloned from the father , she decided : his mother could n't have looked any less like him , tiny where he was hulking , fair and henna-headed where he was swarthy . Her face was like a mouse 's : tiny brown seed eyes , twitching little mouth , too-small teeth she seemed careful to keep hidden . It was as if someone had grabbed her features and made a fist , leaving them bunched together in the middle of her face . Her hair was thin and seemed spun , like sugar or glass , translucent . Her fingers clutched her green handbag like a squirreled nut against her chest . She looked at least as frightened as Birdy felt . " Ms. Stone ? " she said , peering into the empty room . " My Mark says you know about books ? " Birdy admitted she did . " I read a lot , " she said cautiously . " All the time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only Pinetop resident to take advantage of the bookmobile , which arrived in town every other Thursday and parked outside the Whitefront Bar , as if the drunks inside might be interested . Or maybe the driver drank . " You sure read a lot , " he never failed to note from his springy driver 's seat . " Yep , " Birdy never failed to reply . Her last boyfriend , her former fiance , back in Chicago , had accused her of lassitude , of cowardice , of letting novel characters do all her living for her . And why not ? Birdy had asked him . Why the hell not ? Let them do all the dying and fucking up for her , too . Vicarious tragedy , she told him , virtual woe : an idea whose time has come . " I , too , am an avid reader , " Mrs. Anthony confessed . " Spiritual guides , " she added meaningfully . Birdy now felt sure she was going to be handed a Bible and some tract on the evils of literature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually paying attention , reporting on his required reading ? They sat by themselves in the teachers ' lounge , a place like an ER waiting room , someone 's tacky rejected couch and chairs , sputtering bitter-smelling coffee machine , whirring little refrigerator in desperate need of defrosting , windows providing some oblique white light . Smiley faces on the teachers ' mailboxes . A metal case of books , the maroon leather-bound spines of former yearbooks , dozens of them , the only reading matter in the place  --  which apparent self-fascination seemed to Birdy incestuous , the narcissism of the pedestrian , as if those sitting in the lounge wanted only to look at photos of themselves , the building where they worked , the students they taught . Usually the lounge felt too cold to Birdy , although others did not seem bothered . She liked Mark 's mother for looking cold , too ; it gave them something in common . " Want some hot tea ? " she asked her . " Shall I turn up the thermostat ? " But Mrs. Anthony had business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own discomfort . She said , " I 'm writing a book , about my experience , and I thought you could help me . " Birdy 's heart both rose  --  no lecture on immorality !  --  and fell ; books were so big , and everybody thought they should be authoring one . Birdy 's first college major had been creative writing , but even then she could tell she would have nothing fit to say ; she 'd been letting fictional characters provide her with drama for many years by that time . For the first semester she fruitlessly ransacked her past in search of something exciting to write about , marveling over the drivel her class-mates offered up , their step-parents and pets and paramours . It embarrassed her , their naked and feeble obsessions , their trite dilemmas , their whiny and thinly veiled personae , their idiotic shallow fantasies . She sympathized with her professor , a burly alcoholic type who prohibited his students from writing about guitars , recreational drugs , and from the point of view of inanimate objects . What made people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Later , she 'd become that professor 's lover . One of the things he liked best about her was the fact that she did n't want to be a writer , just a reader . His reader , Birdy supposed , his poems all set in foreign countries , featuring exotic women , idiomatic cuisine and custom , consonant-mangling pronunciation . Tongue-tied , Birdy 'd always felt , before him and his work . Mrs. Anthony now pried open her handbag  --  a moss-colored leather contraption with a faux gold beetle as its catch  --  and produced a newspaper article , yellowed , laminated , stiffened like a dead leaf . After handing it to Birdy , she waited , watching with her seedy eyes . There was no telling which newspaper had run the story , or when , as it had been tightly clipped without including masthead or date . PINETOP GIRL FALLS TO DEATH , the headline said . Birdy read as Mrs. Anthony unblinkingly watched . Apparently Mark had had an older sister , Teresa , whose body had been found in a ravine just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Birdy had visited the ancient dwelling when she 'd first moved to town , when she still had an outsider 's touring enthusiasm for Pinetop , when the ramshackle modern junkiness of the place still beguiled her . You drove a few miles down the highway , parked in a sandy lot , then followed a path along the rocky rim of a mountain till a wide , lengthy opening appeared , like the mouth of a Muppet . Along the path ran a looping cable , some sort of measure toward safekeeping , although it seemed more likely that you 'd trip over it than be caught by it . Pinetop 's teenagers for many years had used the site as a party pit , having discovered the same advantages the Anasazi had in perching high above the valley , where they could watch for enemies , protected by the warm bulk of the soft sandstone mountain behind . In the main dwelling , the ceiling was crusty with black soot , its walls covered with twentieth-century petroglyphs : DUANE LOVES TRINA , ROXY IS FOXY , PUMAS RULE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jars with slots knifed into their lids , hand-lettered signs soliciting donations for the cleanup of the ruins . Hopeless . " Young Teresa C.S. Anthony " had been " a tender sixteen years of age " ; there 'd been no sign of what this article called " foul play , " her death attributed to internal bleeding caused by a fall of five hundred feet onto rock . The article tactfully failed to mention the word " suicide , " making do with " unfortunate accident . " Birdy read with a growing anxiety , positive she was going to have to tell Mrs. Anthony what no doubt countless others had already told her : the girl , sad and sixteen , had thrown herself over the cliff , plain and heartbreakingly uncomplicated . There was no conspiracy , she would have to say , no one to blame . A teenager is a dangerous vessel , running around with your love in her careless , self-indulgent hands . Toward Mrs. Anthony she felt a prickly kinship . " I 'm very sorry about your daughter , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year and  --  " Mrs. Anthony reached into her handbag and plucked out another parchmentlike document without acknowledging Birdy 's words ; this meeting was not about Birdy . The second article resembled the first  --  plastic-coated , yellowed , pimpled with tiny air bubbles , no indication of date or source  --  and was headed SECOND TRAGEDY IN LOCAL FAMILY . Birdy read with increasing dread , hoping suddenly that one of her colleagues  --  ideally , Jess , but even the principal Hal Halfon would have been okay , or the retarded custodian , Mr. John , or sour Edith Pack , somebody  --  would come rescue her with inanities and chitchat . Her personality had a pushover aspect to it ; the more she knew about the Anthonys , the more she was going to be involved . That was a reflex triggered by novel reading , she postulated , overidentifying with print characters , constructing wholecloth an accompanying landscape , gothic castle and English moor , beery barroom and cannery row  --  all based on the flimsiest of detail . She sighed , scanning reluctantly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's father , who 'd been killed in a single-car accident two days after his daughter 's death . He 'd rolled on the highway down the mountain , on the road that ran between Pinetop and Albuquerque , the same one Jess sped gaily down for his weekend furloughs , only a few hundred yards from the site of Teresa 's plunge . The article mentioned two survivors , Isadora Anthony and her young son Mark . Birdy turned over the laminated article as if to read the next chapter ; on the back was an ad for rifles . The clip art figure selling them looked a good thirty years out of date . Yet , this was Pinetop ; perhaps the same ad still ran in the Pinetop Mountain Journal , which came out once a week and included an anonymous phone-in column called " Speak Up ! " that , in a year and a half of trying , Birdy had never been able to penetrate . She 'd phone in every few months just to contribute her two cents : " Do n't speak up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut up ! " The third item Mrs. Anthony handed Birdy , what Birdy 's mother would have wryly called the " coop de grass , " was the family 's photograph , taken a few months before the accidents , Mom and Dad , Brother and Sister , little Mark Anthony , all of six or eight years old , with his mischievous eyes turned toward his sister , as if the siblings shared a secret they kept from their parents . He wore cowboy boots and hat , a little silver six-shooter strapped to his hip ; the sister smiled beguilingly at the photographer , sexy beyond her years . This picture , the quintessential nuclear family , posed before the ethereal blue backdrop of professional photo studios , plus the other two articles , Mrs. Anthony insisted that Birdy keep . " I want you to help me write my story , " she said , sitting properly , her knees pressed together beneath her purse as if restraining the need to pee . Was it primness ? Simple cold ? " I know what I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what should go where . I 've tried and I 've tried , but I ca n't ; I never went to college . I thought since you teach all these books about terrible things , you could help . " Why are all the stories so depressing ? Birdy thought . " I know there 's a book in this , " she added , when Birdy could think of no good enough excuse to say no . On a tangent , she was troubled that Mark had told his mother he only read books about terrible things . She hoped that was n't what all the students thought , but knew they probably did . Ever since she 'd moved to Pinetop , she 'd been sending off her applications to other districts like bobbing forlorn messages in bottles : Help . Someday when the houses were on the move , she was just going to have to stand on the highway with her thumb in the air , hope to hitch a ride on one of those wide loads . Meanwhile ... " Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthony pleaded . " Just take the stories and think about it ? "
