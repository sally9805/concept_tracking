Section : Methods AND Materials <p> When I suggested to painter Margot Trout , of Great Barrington , Massachusetts , that I call her some afternoon to discuss her art , she did n't mince words . " No , " she answered bluntly , " you ca n't call me then , because I paint in the afternoon . " Her response may seem curt , but having known Trout for almost 20 years , I know that if one thing is sacrosanct to her , it 's her painting rime . Trout paints the majority of her work in one shot-meaning she starts and completes a painting all in one session . And once she begins working , interruptions are simply not allowed . <p> I understand the intense commitment Trout has to her studio time , because I tend to do my own still-life paintings in mostly a one-shot process as well . To begin , I set up all my materials , drink a few cups of coffee , take the telephone off the hook , and then start working  --  not stopping until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may only take an hour , and other times , many hours . I paint this way because I find that I can almost never go back into a painting at a later time with the same energy and concentration that allowed me to initially " see " a particular still life . One-shot painting  --  which is often referred to as single-session or alla prima painting  --  is a method that has devoted followers . <p> " I did n't just suddenly decide to do one-shot paintings , " Trout reflects . " I started doing them because I noticed that whenever I went back to my paintings a second rime , I simply could n't see the same things . The weather , the light , and even the motif that originally appealed to me were different . I 'm a one-shot painter because I believe the significance and meaning of what you see is most powerful when you first see it . " <p> The artist finds that a phenomenal level of concentration is necessary when doing one-shot paintings . " Whether I work on a painting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I lose all sense of time while I am doing it and end up wobbly with fatigue after it is finished , " she explains . " I would never interrupt an orchestra director or a brain surgeon while they are working  --  and this is no easier . " <p> In preparation for her painting sessions , Trout readies up to 50 brushes and arranges her numerous colors into a precise order on the palette . She creates her palette by coating a 3 ' - x- 4 ' piece of plywood with gray enamel paint and setting it on sawhorses . To begin working , the artist first mixes all the larger color areas , adjusting them on the palette to form a chord of colors that captures the feeling she got from the subject that originally inspired her . While she often has a sense of the composition she wants in her mind , she never preplans or draws this on the canvas . Instead , she develops the painting as a whole , adjusting the colors to be as precise as possible  --  as individual hues and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers of color areas , , working to the edges where colors meet . She never starts with the edges of objects . She knows that the relationship between her colors is working out when the painting begins to radiate light ; at this point , each color she adds either enhances or diminishes this light . <p> " I also find that one-shot paintings have a high failure rate , so I am prepared to make changes , " the artist explains . She keeps rags and turpentine on hand and says that it is not uncommon for her to wipe off a whole painting once or twice to begin again . Trout works with a dozen canvases nearby in case the light changes or she changes her mind about the composition . " One-shot paintings have such a life of their own that I often feel I have little control over the success of the painting , " she says . " I go out there to try to get hold of the truth  --  and if I get it , I keep it . If I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start over . For me , the process is fraught with both accepting frustration and intense receptiveness to what I see and feel . " <p> Turn-of-the-century American artist Edward W. Redfield ( 1869-1965 ) of Center Bridge , Pennsylvania , became known for his bravura in painting one-shot landscapes in all sorts of weather . For example , in temperatures so cold he had to use linseed oil to keep his paints from freezing , Redfield would lug large canvases often measuring more than four feet on each side into the woods , anchor them to trees with rope , and , without any preliminary drawing , complete a painting from scratch in just one day . To create a work like Laurel Run , for instance , he would undauntedly paint while standing in the snow for up to eight hours . His wife later recalled how each morning she would pack him a lunch only to have him return with it in the evening , uneaten  --  apparently forgotten in the throes of the one-shot painting process . <p> Sam Adoquei , of Bayside , New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning the craft of painting . Adoquei identities with James Abbott McNeill Whistler ( 1834-1903 ) , who was once asked how he could expect the public to buy a painting completed in a very short rime . He responded that the price of the painting did not reflect the speed with which it was executed , but rather , the skill the artist has gained over a lifetime . <p> " The rewards of single-session paintings are the same as for any other type of painting , " explains Adoquei . " Just as a good writer can use either a pencil or a computer to write a bestseller , a skilled artist can complete a successful painting over a long period of rime or within a single session . " He adds that one-shot painting requires a great deal of skill , as it forces the artist to solve problems under pressure . Indeed , the concentration Adoquei must achieve to produce one-shot work has trained him to paint under virtually any condition . " For example , I was doing a commissioned portrait in a client 's apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids were playing and the subject 's husband was there , I still had to paint her in one session . It took skill to ignore those distractions and focus only on my work . " <p> Landscape painting , on the other hand , comes with problems of its own . " The other evening , I received a phone call from a friend who had passed by earlier and seen me painting outdoors , " the artist explains . " He asked if my jumping around was an indication of my energy level while doing one-shot paintings . No , I told him  --  I was fighting mosquitoes ! " <p> Learning one-shot painting might be compared to studying a language . First , students struggle with the basics , tackling spelling and verbs until they know them well enough to convey ideas quickly and easily . Likewise , for Adoquei , a strong knowledge of the craft of painting allows him to work quickly and communicate visual ideas without sacrificing quality . Unless a single-session artist has a firm grasp on the craft of painting , he contends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being slapdash or gimmicky . <p> " After some practice , however , it 's amazing how paintings that used to take two weeks now take only two days , " Adoquei attests . " I think it takes a bit of extra work for even a good painter to master the single-session approach . But once mastered , no other painting process can match its rewards .
