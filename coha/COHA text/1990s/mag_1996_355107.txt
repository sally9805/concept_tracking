I thought I might be having a bad week . First , a friend of mine who works in the telecommunications industry told me the Internet is going to go kerplop one of these days . Because it was never intended for the sort of use it 's getting , he said , it is n't designed to be sufficiently " robust . " <P> " How about redundant ? " I said . " Does n't it have enough redundancy to avoid infrastructure breakdown ? " I did n't want him to think he was the only one who knew how to talk like an engineer . <P> " No redundancy to speak of , " he said . <P> As I understood what he was saying  --  and I did n't actually understand it very well , because I know nothing about such subjects except that it sounds impressive to use words like redundancy  --  the Internet is going to do a cyberspace version of burning its little motor out , like a washing machine that has had too many bath towels in it too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internet crumps out . So what ? Sure , I use it , but I could get along without it . I 'm not a Web zombie . I 'm not someone who is thrown into a tizzy by the thought that the athlete's-foot chat room will someday go dark . When nobody is logging on anywhere , I wo n't be wandering the streets buttonholing strangers who might just feel the need to share stories of unbearable itching . <P> What I 'm saying is that I tried to distance myself from the situation . That is the normal human response . When it comes to disasters that are about to happen , most people try to figure out a way that the news does n't apply to them . <P> Oddly enough , a day or two after I heard that the Internet was comparable to an abused Maytag , I was told about another impending technological disaster . " It never rains but it pours , " my mother used to say  --  and she said that before the invention of even the plain-paper fax . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even if many expensive adjustments are made beforehand , the year 2000 is likely to wreak havoc with the records of the financial industry . <P> As I understand what she was saying , this disaster will be less like an overloaded washing machine than a washing machine whose load consists of all your best white garments plus one magenta sweater that does not , contrary to the explicit statement on the label , hold its color . <P> Apparently computer records are kept in strings of digits , and only two digits in the string are used to designate the year . Calculations are based on constantly going to a higher number , and when 99 goes to 00 , the computer will think it has gone to a lower number . ( Sure , the computer should know better , but let 's face it , computers are sometimes dumb as dirt . ) Magenta will start to run . " As an example , " I was told , " bonds that pay more as the number of the year goes higher will pay less because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have some bonds like that already , " I said . My financial affairs , in fact , have always looked as if they 've been in the washing machine for a long time with a runny sweater . In other words , this would be nothing new . So , I figured , let the financial industry worry about its own data-processing problems . As Immanuel Kant used to say , " It do n't make me no nevermind. "
