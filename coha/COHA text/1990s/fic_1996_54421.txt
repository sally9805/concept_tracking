When Bruce Sterling called me last year to say he could no longer do a science column on a regular basis , I begged him to continue . I pleaded with him . ( Remember , we mentioned the art of editorial begging in a previous issue . ) When it became clear that I could not change his mind , I asked that he send us an occasional short story . <p> " The Littlest Jackal " is not an occasional short story . It is a strong novella , bringing Bruce 's continuing character , Leggy Starlitz , back to our pages . <p> I hate sibelius , " said the Russian mafioso . <p> " It 's that Finnish nationalist thing , " said Leggy Starlitz . <p> " That 's why I hate Sibelius . " The Russian 's name was Pulat R. Khoklov . He 'd once been a KGB liaison officer to the air force of the Afghan government . Like many Afghan War veterans , Khoklov had gone into organized crime since the Soviet crackup . <p> Starlitz examined the Sibelius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional eye . " Europeans sure pretend to like this classic stuff , " he said . " Almost like pop , but it ca n't move real product . " He placed the CD back in the rack . The outdoor market table was nicely set with cunningly targeted tourist-bait . Starlitz glanced over the glass earrings and the wooden jewelry , then closely examined a set of lewd postcards . <p> " This is n't ' Europe , ' " Khoklov sniffed . " This is a Czarist Grand Duchy with bourgeois pretensions . " <p> Starlitz fingered a poly-cotton souvenir jersey with comical red-nosed reindeer . It bore an elaborate legend in the Finno-Ugric tongue , a language infested with umlauts . " This is Finland , ace . It 's European Union . " <p> Khoklov was kitted-out to the nines in a three-piece linen suit and a snappy straw boater . Life in the New Russia had been very good to Khoklov . " At least Finland 's not NATO . " <p> " Look , fuckin ' Poland is NATO now . Get over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manned by a comely Finn in a flowered summer frock and icily shoes . Starlitz tried on a pair of shades from a revolving stand . He gazed experimentally about the marketplace . Potatoes . Dill . Carrots and onions . Buckets of strawberries . Flowers and flags . Orange fabric canopies over wooden market tables run by Turks and gypsies . People were selling salmon straight from the decks of funky little fishing boats . <p> Khoklov sighed . " Lekhi , you have no historical perspective . " He plucked a Dunhill from a square red pack . <p> One of Khoklov 's two bodyguards appeared at once , alertly flicking a Zippo . " No proper sense of culture , " insisted Khoklov , breathing smoke and coughing richly . The guard tucked the lighter into his Chicago Bulls jacket and padded off silently on his spotless Adidas . <p> Starlitz , who was trying to quit , hummed a smoke from Khoklov , which he was forced to light for himself . Then he paid for the shades , peeling a salmon-colored fifty from a dense wad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Czarina 's Obelisk , a bellicose monument festooned with Romanov aristo-fetish gear in cast bronze . Khoklov , whose politics shaded toward Pamyat rightism with a mystical pan-Slavic spin , patted the granite base of the Obelisk with open pleasure . <p> Then he gazed across the Esplanadi . " Helsinki city hall ? " <p> Starlitz adjusted his shades . When arranging his end of the deal from a cellar in Tokyo , he had n't quite gathered that Finland would be so relentlessly bright . " That 's the city hall all right . " <p> Khoklov turned to examine the sun-spattered Baltic . " Think you could hit that building from a passing boat ? " <p> " You mean me personally ? Forget it . " <p> " I mean someone in a hired speedboat with a shoulder-launched surplus Red Army panzerfaust . Generically speaking . " <p> " Anything 's possible nowadays . " <p> " At night , " urged Khoklov . " A pre-dawn urban commando raid ! Cleverly planned . Precisely executed . Ruthless operational accuracy ! " <p> " This is summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not gon na set here for a couple of months . " <p> Khoklov , tripped up in the midst of his reverie , frowned . " No matter . You were n't the agent I had in mind in any case . " <p> They wandered on . A Finn at a nearby table was selling big swollen muskrat-fur hats . No sane local would buy these items , for they were the exact sort of pseudo-authentic cultural relics that appeared only in tourist economies . The Finn , however , was flourishing . He was deftly slotting and whipping the Mastercards and Visas of sunburnt Danes and Germans through a handheld cellular credit checker . <p> " Our man arrives tomorrow morning on the Copenhagenferry , " Khoklov announced . <p> " You ever met this character before ? " Starlitz said . " Ever done any real business with him ? " <p> Khoklov sidled along , flicking the smoldering butt of his Dunhill onto the gray stone cobbles . " I 've never met him myself . My boss knew him in the seventiess . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Berlin . They called him Raf , back then . Raf the Jackal . " <p> Starlitz scratched his close-cropped , pumpkin-like head . " I 've heard of Carlos the Jackal . " <p> " No , no , " Khoklov said , pained . " Carlos retired , he 's in Khartoum . This is Raf . A different man entirely . " <p> " Where 's he from ? " <p> " Argentina . Or Italy . He once ran arms between the Tupamaros and the Red Brigades . We think he was an Italian Argentine originally . " <p> " KGB recruited him and you did n't even know his nationality ? " Khoklov frowned . " We never recruited him ! KGB never had to recruit any of those Seventies people ! Baader-Meinhoff , Palestinians . . . They always came straight to us ! " He sighed wistfully . " American Weather Underground  --  how I wanted to meet a groovy hippie revolutionary from Weather Underground ! But even when they were blowing up the Bank of America the Yankees would never talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be getting on in years . " <p> " No no . He 's very much alive , and very charming . The truly dangerous are always very charming . It 's how they survive . " <p> " I like surviving " Starlitz said thoughtfully . <p> " Then you can learn a few much-needed lessons in charm , Lekhi . Since you 're our liaison . " <p> Raf the Jackal arrived from across the Baltic in a sealed Fiat . It was a yellow two-door with Danish plates . His driver was a Finnish girl , maybe twenty . Her dyed-black hair was braided with long green extensions of tattered yam . She wore a red blouse , cut-off jeans and striped cotton stockings . <p> Starlitz climbed into the passenger seat , slammed the door , and smiled . The girl was sweating with heat , fear , and nervous tension . She had a battery of ear-piercings . A tattooed wolf's-head was stenciled up her clavicle and nosing at the base of her neck . <p> Starlitz twisted and looked behind him . The urban guerrilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doped , or dead . Raf wore a denim jacket , relaxed-fit Levis and Ray-Bans . He 'd taken his sneakers off and was sleeping in his rumpled mustard-yellow socks . <p> " How 's the old man ? " Starlitz said , adjusting his seat belt . <p> " Ferries make him seasick . " The girl headed up the Esplanade . " We 'll wake him at the safe-house . " She shot him a quick sideways glance of kohllined eyes . " You found a good safe-house ? " <p> " Sure , the place should do , " said Starlitz . He was pleased that her English was so good . After four years tending bar in Roppongi , the prospect of switching Japanese for Finnish was dreadful . " What do they call you ? " <p> " What did they tell you to call me ? " <p> " Got no instructions on that . " <p> The girl 's pale knuckles whitened on the Fiat 's steering-wheel . " They did n't inform you of my role in this operation ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Raf is our agent now , " the girl said . " He 's not your agent . Our operations coincide  --  but only because our interests coincide . Raf belongs to my movement . He does n't belong to any kind of Russians . " <p> Starlitz twisted in his seat to stare at the slumbering terrorist . He envied the guy 's deep sense of peace . It was hard to tell through the Ray-Bans , but the smear of sweat on his balding forehead gave Raf a look of unfeigned ease . <p> Starlitz pondered the girl 's latest remark . He had no idea why a college-age female Finn would claim to be commanding a 51-year-old veteran urban guerrilla . <p> " Why do you say that ? " he said at last . This was usually a safe and useful question . <p> The girl glanced in the rear-view . They were passing a sunstruck green park , with bronze statues of swaggering Finnish poets and mood-stricken Finnish dramatists . She took a comer with a squeak of tires . " Since you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay . I 'm Leggy . . . . Or Lekhi . . . . Or Keggae . " He 'd been getting a lot of " Reggae " lately . " The safe-house is in Ypsallina . You know that neighborhood ? " Starlitz plucked a laminated tourist map from his shirt pocket . " Take Mannerheimintie up past the railway station . " <p> " You 're not Russian , " Aino concluded . <p> " Nyet . " <p> " Are you Organizatsiya ? " <p> " I forget what you have to do to officially join the Russian mafia , but basically , no . " <p> " Why are you involved in the Alands operation ? You do n't look political . " <p> Leggy found the lever beneath the passenger seat and leaned back a little , careful not to jostle the slumbering terrorist . " You 're sure you want to hear about that ? " <p> " Of course I want to hear . Since we are working together . " <p> " Okay . Have it your way . It 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Tokyo working for an all-girl Japanese metal band . These girls made it pretty big and they bought this disco downtown in Roppongi . I was managing the place . . . . Besides the headbanging , these metal-chicks ran another racket on the side . Memorabilia . A target-market teenage-kid thing . Fanmags , keychains , T-shirts , CD-ROMs . . . . Lotta money there ! " <p> Aino stopped at a traffic light . The cobbled crosswalk filled with a pedestrian mass of sweating , sun-dazed Finns . <p> " Anyway , after I developed that teen market , I found this other thing . These cute little animals . ' Froofies . ' Major hit in Japan . Froofy velcro shoes , Froofy candy , sodas , backpacks , badges , lunchkits . . . Froofies are what they call ' kawai . ' " <p> Aino drove on . They passed a bronze Finnish general on horseback . He had been a defeated general , but he looked like defeating him again would be far more trouble than it was worth . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' Cute ' does n't get it across . Maybe ' adorable . ' Big-money-making adorable . The kicker is that Froofies come from Finland . " <p> " I 'm a Finn . I do n't know anything called Froofies . " <p> " They 're kids ' books . This little old Finnish lady wrote them . On her kitchen table . Illustrated kid-stories from the Forties and Fifties . Of course lately they 've been made into manga and anime and Nintendo cassettes and a whole bunch of other stuff . . . . " <p> Aino 's brows rose . " Do you mean Fluuvins ? Little blue animals with heads like big fat pillows ? " <p> " Oh , you know them , then . " <p> " My mother read me Fluuvins ! Why would Japanese want Fluuvins ? " <p> " Well , the scam was  --  this old lady , she lives on this secluded island . Middle of the Baltic . Complete ass-end of nowhere . Old girl never married . No manager . No agent . Obviously not getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senile . So the plan is  --  I fly over to Finland . To these islands . Hunt her down . Cut a deal with her . Get her signature . Then , we sue . " <p> " I do n't understand you . " <p> " She lives in the Aland Islands . Those islands are crucial to your people , and the Organizatsiya too . So you see the general convergence of interests here ? " <p> Aino shook her green-braided head . " We have serious political and economic interests in the Alands . Fluuvins are silly books for children . " <p> " What 's ' serious ? ' I 'm talking plastic action figures ! Cartoon drinking glasses . Kid-show theme songs . When a thing like this hits , it 's major revenue . Factories churning round the clock in Shenzhen . Crates full of stuff into mall anchor-stores . Did you know that the ' California Raisins ' are worth more than the entire California raisin crop ? That 's a true fact ! " <p> Aino was growing gloomy . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Raisins are nasty little dead grapes . " <p> " I 'm copacetic , but we 're talking Japan here , " Starlitz insisted . " Higher per-capita than Marin County ! The ruble 's in the toilet now , but the yen is sky-high . We get a big shakedown settlement in yen , we launder it in rubles , and we clear major revenue completely off the books . That 's serious as cancer . " <p> Aino lowered her voice . " I do n't believe you . Why are you telling me such terrible lies ? That 's a very stupid cover story for an international spy ! " <p> " You had to ask . " Starlitz shrugged . <p> They found the safehouse in Ypsallina . It was a duplex . The other half of the duplex was occupied by a gullible Finnish yuppie couple with workaholic schedules . Starlitz produced the keys . Aino went in , checked every room and every window with paranoid care , then went back to the Fiat and woke Raf . <p> Raf wobbled into the apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then turned on the shower . Arno brought in a pair of bulging blue nylon sports bags . There was no phone service , but Khoklov 's people had thoughtfully left a clone-chipped cellular on the bedroom dresser . <p> Starlitz , who had been in the safehouse before , retrieved his laptop from the kitchen closet . It was Japanese portable with a keyboard the length of a cricket bat , a complex mess of ASCII , kanji , katakana , hiragana and arcane function keys . It had a cellular modem . <p> Starlitz logged in to a Helsinki Internet service provider and checked the metal-band 's Website in Tokyo . Nothing much happening there . Sachiho was doing TV tabloid shows . Hukie had gone into production . Ako was in the studio for a solo album . Sayoko was pregnant . Again . <p> Starlitz tried his hotlist and found a new satellite JPEG file of developments on the ground in Bosnia . Starlitz was becoming very interested in Bosnia . He had n't been there yet , but he could feel the lure increasing steadily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubble had busted , the glitz had run out of the Tokyo street-party and now the high yen was chasing the gaijin off . But Bosnia was clearly a very coming scene for the mid-90s . Not Bosnia per se ( unless you were a merc , or crazy ) but the surrounding safe-areas where the arms and narco people were setting up : Slovenia , Bulgaria , Macedonia , Albania . <p> Practically every entity that Starlitz found of interest was involved in the Bosnian scene . UN . USA . NATO . European Union . Russian intelligence , Russia mafia ( interlocking directorates there ) . Germans . Turks . Greeks . Ndrangheta . Camorra . Israelis . Saudis . Iranians . Moslem Brotherhood . An enormous gaggle of mercs . There was even a happening Serbian folk-metal scene where Serb chicks went gigging for hooting audiences of war criminals . It was cool the way the Yugoslav scene kept re-complicating . It was his kind of scene . <p> Raf emerged from the bathroom . He 'd shaved and had caught his thinning wet hair in a ponytail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there was muscle in his hairy shoulders . <p> Raf unzipped one of the sports bags . He tunneled into a baggy black T-shirt . <p> Starlitz logged off . <p> Raf yawned . " Dramamine never works . Sorry . " <p> " No problem , Raf . " <p> Raf gazed around the apartment . The pupils of his dark eyes were two shrunken pinpoints . " Where 's the girl ? " <p> Starlitz shrugged . " Maybe she went out to cop some Chinese . " <p> Raf found his shades and a packet of Gauloise . Raf might have been Italian . The accent made this seem plausible . " The boot of the car , " he said . " Could you help ? " <p> They hauled a big wrapped tarpaulin from the trunk of the Fiat and into the safe-house . Raf deftly untied the tarp and spread its contents across the chill linoleum of the kitchenette . <p> Rifles . Pistols . Amino . Grenades . Plastique . Fuse wire . Detonator : Startitz examined the arsenal skeptically . The hardware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and greased AK-47 . The rifle looked like it had been buried for several years , but buried by someone who knew how to bury weapons properly . Raf slotted the curved magazine and patted the tarnished wooden butt . <p> " Ever seen a Pancor Jackhammer ? " asked Starlitz . " Modern gas-powered combat shotgun , all-plastic , bullpup design ? Does four twelve-gauge rounds a second . The ammo drums double as landmines . " <p> Raf nodded . " Yes , I do the trade shows . But you know  --  as a practical matter  --  you have to let people know that you can kill them . " <p> " Yeah ? Why is-that ? " <p> " Everyone knows the classic AK silhouette . You show civilians the AK  --  " Raf brandished the rifle expertly  --  " they throw themselves on the floor . You bring in your modem plastic auto-shotgun , they think it 's a vacuum cleaner . " <p> " I take your point . " <p> Raf lifted a bomb-clustered khaki webbing belt . " See these pineapples ? Grenades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they truly look like grenades . What was your name again , my friend ? " <p> " Starlitz . " <p> " Starlet , you carry these pineapples on your belt into a bank or a hotel lobby , you will never have to use them . Because people know pineapples . Of course , when you use grenades , you do n't want to use these silly things . You want these rifle-mounted BG-15s , with the rocket propellant . " <p> Starlitz examined the scraped and greasy rifle-grenades . The cylindrical explosive tubes looked very much like welding equipment , except for the stenciled military Cyrillic . " Those been kicking around a while ? " <p> " The Basques swear by them . They work a charm against armored limos . " <p> " Basque . I hear that language is even weirder than Finnish . " <p> " You carry a gun , Starlet ? " <p> " Not at the mo ' . " <p> " Take one little gun , " said Raf generously . " Take that Makarov nine-millimeter . Nice combat handgun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe later , " Starlitz said . " I might appropriate a key or so of that plastique . If you do n't mind . " <p> Raf smiled . " Why ? " <p> " It 's really hard finding good Semtex since Havel shut down the factories , " Starlitz said moodily . " I might feel the need ' cause . . . I got this certain personal problem with video installations . " <p> " Have a cigarette , " said Raf sympathetically , shaking his pack . " I can see that you need one . " <p> " Thanks . " Starlitz lit a Gauloise . " Video 's all over the place nowadays . Banks got videos . . . hotels got videos . . . groceries . . . cash machines . . . cop cars . . . Man , I hate video . I always hated video . Nowadays , video is really getting on my nerves . " <p> " It 's panoptic surveillance , " said Raf . " It 's the Spectacle . " <p> Starlitz blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter further , " Raf said intently . " Work in the Struggle requires a solid theoretical ' grounding . Then you can focus this instinctive proletarian resentment into a coherent revolutionary response . " He began sawing through a wrapped brick of Semtex with a butterknife from the kitchen drawer . <p> Starlitz ripped the plastique to chunks and stuffed them into his baggy pockets . <p> The door opened . Aino had returned . She had a companion : a very tall and spectrally pale young Finn with an enormous cotton-candy wad of steely purple hair . He wore a pearl-buttoned cowboy shirt and leather jeans . A large gold ring pierced his nasal septum and hung over his upper lip . <p> " Who is this ? " smiled Raf , swiftly tucking the Makarov into the back of his belt . <p> " This is Eero , " said Aino . " He programs . For the movement . " <p> Eero gazed at the floor with a diffident shrug . " Many people are better hackers than myself . " His eyes widened suddenly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our safe house , " said Raf . <p> Eero nodded . The tip of his tongue stole out and played nervously with the dangling gold ring . <p> " Eero came quickly so we could get started at once , " Aino said . She looked at the greasy arsenal with mild disdain , the way one might look at a large set of unattractive wedding china . " Now where is the money ? " <p> Starlitz and Raf exchanged glances . <p> " I think what Raf is trying to say , " said Starlitz gently , " is that traditionally you do n't bring a contact to the safehouse . Safehouses are for storing weapons and sleeping . You meet contacts in open-air situations or public locales . It 's just a standard way of doing business . " <p> Aino was wounded . " Eero 's okay ! We can trust him . Eero 's in my sociology class . " <p> " I 'm sure Eero is fine , " said Raf serenely . <p> " He brought a cell-phone , " Starlitz said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Cops and spooks can track people 's movements through mobile cellphones . " <p> " It 's all right , " Raf said gallantly . " Eero is your friend , my dear , so we trust him . Next time we are a bit more careful with our operational technique . Okay ? " Raf spread his hands , judiciously . " Comrade Eero , since you 're here , take a little something . Have a grenade . " <p> " Truly ? " said Eero , with a self-effacing smile . " Thank you . " He tried stuffing a pineapple , without success , into the tight leather pocket of his jeans . <p> " Where is the money ? " Arno repeated . <p> Raf shook his head gently . " I 'm sure Mister Starlet is not so foolish to bring so much cash to our first meeting . " <p> " The cash is at a dead drop , " Starlitz said . " That 's a standard method of transferral . That way , if you 're surveilled , the oppo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tactical teachings of good old Patrice Lumumba University , " said Raf cheerfully . " You were an alumnus , Starlet ? " <p> " Nope , " said Starlitz . " Never was the Joe College type . But the Russian mob 's chock-full of Lumumba grads . " <p> " I understand this money transfer tactic , " murmured Eero , swinging the grenade awkwardly at the end of one bony wrist . " It 's like an anonymous remailer at an Internet site . Removing accountability . " <p> " Is the money in US dollars ? " said Aino . <p> Raf pursed his lips . " We do n't accept any so-called dollars that come from Russia , remember ? Too much fresh ink . " <p> " It 's in yen , " said Starlitz . " Three point two million US . " <p> Raf brightened . " Point two ? " <p> " It was three mill when we finalized the deal , but the yen had another uptick . Consider it a little gift from our Tokyo contacts . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's good news , " said Aino , with a tender smile . <p> Starlitz turned to Eero . " Is that enough bread to get you and your friends set up in the Alands with the networked Suns ? " <p> Eero blinked limpidly . " The workstations have all arrived safely . No more problems in America with computer export restrictions . We could ship American computers straight to Russia if we liked . " <p> " That 's swell . Any problem getting proper crypto ? " <p> Eero picked at a purple wisp of hair with his free hand . " The Dutch have been most understanding . " <p> " Any problem leasing the bank building in the Alands , then ? " <p> " We bought the building . With money to spare . It was a cannery , but the Baltic has been driftnetted , so . . . . " Eero shrugged his bony shoulders . " It has a little Turkish restaurant next door . So the programmers have plenty of pilaf and shashlik . Finn programmers . . . we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raf enthused , all jolliness . " I have n't had a decent pilaf since Beirut . " <p> Starlitz narrowed his eyes . " How about your personnel ? Any problems there ? " <p> Eero nodded . " We wish we had more people on the start-up , of course . Technical start-ups always want more people . Still , we have enough Finnish hackers to boot and run your banking system . We are mostly very young people , but if those Russian maths professors can log in from Leningrad - sorry , Petersburg  --  then we should have no big problems . The Russian maths people , they were all unemployed unfortunately for them . But they are very good programmers , very solid skills . The only problem with our many young hackers from Finland . . . . " Eero absently switched the grenade from hand to hand . " Well , we are so very excited about the first true Internet money-laundry . We tried very hard not to talk , not to tell anyone what we are doing , but . . . well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Tell your mouse-jockeys to sit on the news a while longer , " Starlitz said . <p> " Really , it 's too late , " Eero told him meekly . <p> Starlitz frowned . " Well , how many goddamn people have you Finn cowboys let in on this thing , for Christ 's sake ? " <p> " How many people read the alt newsgroups ? " Eero said . " I do n't have those figures , but there 's alt.hack , alt.2600 , alr.smash.the.state , alt.fan.blacknet . . . . Many . " <p> Starlitz ran his hand over his head . " Right , " he said . Like most Internet disasters , the situation was a fait accompli . " Okay , that development has torn it big-time . Aino , you did right to bring this guy here right away . The hell with proper operational protocol . We got ta get that bank up and running as soon as possible . " <p> " There 's nothing wrong with publicity , " Raf said . " We need publicity to attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " Starlitz said . " The Russian mob is already running the biggest money-laundry since the Second World War . The arms and narco crowd worldwide are banging down the doors . Black electronic cash is a vital component of the emergent global system . The point is  --  we got a very narrow window of opportunity here . If our little crowd is gon na get anything out of this set-up , we have got ta be there with a functional online money-laundry just when the system really needs one . And just before everybody else realizes that . " <p> " Then publicity is vital , " Raf insisted . " Publicity is our oxygen ! With a major development like this one , you must seize and create your own headlines . It 's like Leila Khaled always says : ' The world has to hear our voice . ' " <p> Aino blinked . " Is Leila Khaled still alive ? " <p> " Leila lives ! " Raf said . " Wonderful woman , Leila Khaled . She does social work in Damascus with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the new Palestinian government . " <p> " Leila Khaled , " said Aino thoughtfully . " I envy her historical experience so much . There 's something so direct and healthy and physical about hijacking planes . " <p> Eero could n't seem to find a place inside his clothing for the grenade . Finally he placed it daintily on the kitchen counter and regarded it with morose respect . <p> " Any other questions ? " Raf asked Starlitz . <p> " Yeah , plenty , " Starlitz said . " The Organizatsiya 's got their pet Russian math professors working the technical problems . I figure the Russians can hack the math  --  Russians do great at that . But black-market online money laundering is a commercial customer service operation . Customer service is definitely not a Russian specialty . " <p> " So ? " <p> " So we ca n't hang around waiting for clearance from Moscow Mafia muckety-mucks . If this scheme is gon na work , we got ta slam it together and get it online pronto . We need quick results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Raf briskly . " I always specialize in quick results . " He shook Eero 's hand . " You 've been very helpful , Eero . It was pleasant to meet you . Enjoy your stay in the islands . We look forward to further constructive contacts . Viva la revolucion digitale ! Goodbye and good luck . " <p> " You do n't have the big money for us yet ? " Eero said . <p> " Real soon now , " Starlitz said . <p> " Could I have some cab fare please ? " <p> Starlitz gave him a 100-mark Jean Sibelius banknote . " Hei hei , " Eero said , with a melancholy smile . He tucked the note into his cowboy shirt pocket and left . <p> Starlitz saw the hacker to the door , and checked the street as the cadaverous Finn ambled off . He was unsurprised to see Khoklov 's two bodyguards lurking clumsily in a white Hertz rental car , parked up the street . Presumably they were relaying signals from the plethora of covert listening devices that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eero drifted past the Russian mobsters in a daze of hacker self-absorption . Starlitz found the kid an interesting specimen . In Japan there were plenty of major Goth kids , but the vampire people-in-black contingent had never really crossbred with Japan 's hacker population . Here in Finland , though , there were somber and lugubrious hairsprayed Cure fans pretty much across the social spectrum : car repair guys , hotel staff , pizza delivery , government clerks , the works . <p> When Starlitz returned , Raf was hunting in the kitchen for coffee . " Aino , let 's review the political situation . " <p> Aino perched obediently on a birchwood kitchen stool . " The Aland Islands are a chain in the Gulf of Bothnia between Finland and Sweden . They include Aland , Foglo , Kokar , Sottunga , Kumlinge , and Brando . " <p> " Yeah , right , okay , " Starlitz grunted . <p> " The largest city is Mariehamm with ten thousand inhabitants . " She paused . " That 's where the autonomous digital bank will be established . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " There are twenty-five thousand Aland citizens , mostly farmers and fishery people , but thirty percent are engaged in the tourist industry . They run small-scale casinos and duty-free shops . The Alands are a popular day-tripping destination from continental Europe . " <p> Starlitz nodded . He 'd seen the shortlist of potential candidates for a Russian offshore banking set-up . The Alands offered the tastiest possibilities . <p> Aino sat up straighter . " The inhabitants are Swedish-speaking ethnics . In 1920 , against their will and against a popular plebiscite , they were ceded to Finland as part of a negotiated settlement by the now-extinct League of Nations . In truth these oppressed people are neither Swedes nor Finns . They are Alanders . " <p> " The islands ' national liberation will proceed along two fronts , " said Raf , deftly setting a coffeepot to boil . " The first is the Aland Island Liberation Front , which is , essentially , my operation . The second front is Aino 's people from the university , the Suomi Anti-Imperialist Cells , who make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperialism . The outbreak of armed struggle and a terror campaign will provoke domestic crisis in Finland . The cheapest and easiest apparent solution will be to grant full autonomy to the Alands . Since the islands are an easy day-trip from Petersburg this will leave the Organizatsiya with a free hand for their banking operations . " <p> " You 're a busy guy , Raf . " <p> " I 've been resting on my laurels long enough , " said Raf , carefully rinsing three spanking-new coffee mugs . " It 's a new Europe now . Many fantastic new opportunities . " <p> " Level with me . Do any of these Aland Island hicks really want independence ? They seem to be doing okay just as they are . " <p> Raf , surprised at the question , smiled . <p> Aino frowned . " Much work remains to be done in the way of raising revolutionary consciousness in the Alands . But we in the Suomi Anti-Imperialist Cells will have the resources to do that political work . Victory will be ours , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a captive nation against its will . Or if they do  --  " She smiled bitterly . " That will demonstrate the tenuousness of the current Finnish regime and its basic failure as a European state . " <p> " Who have we got on the ground in the Alands who can speak their local weirdo version of Swedish ? Just in case we need to , like , phone in a claim or something . " <p> " We have three people , " Raf said . " The new premier , the new foreign minister , and of course the new economics minister , who will be in charge of easing things for the Russian operations . They are the shadow cabinet of the Alands Republic . " <p> " Three people ? " <p> " Three people are plenty ! There are only twenty-five thousand of them total . If the projections are right , the offshore bank will be clearing twenty-five million dollars in the first six months ! Those islands are little rocks . It 's potatoes and fish and casinos for rich Germans . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can buy them all . " <p> " They matter , " Aino said . " They matter to the Movement . " <p> " But of course . " <p> " The Alands deserve their nation . If they do n't deserve their nation , then we Finns do n't deserve our nation . There are only five million Finns . " <p> " We always yield to political principle , " said Raf indulgently . He passed her a brimming mug . " Drink your coffee . You need to go to work . " <p> Aino glanced at her watch , surprised . " Oh . Yes . " <p> " Shall I cut the hash into gram bags ? Or will you take the brick ? " <p> She blinked . " You do n't have to cut it , Raffi . They can cut it at the bar . " <p> Raf opened one of the sports bags and passed her a fat brick of dope neatly wrapped in a Copenhagen newspaper . <p> " You work in a bar ? That 's a good cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hash is that ? " <p> " Something very new in Europe , " Raf said . " It 's Azerbaijani hash . " <p> " Ex-Soviet hash is n't really very good , " sniffed Aino . " They do n't know how to do it right . . . . I do n't like to sell hash . But if you sell people drugs , then they respect you . They wo n't talk about you when cops come . I hate cops . Cops are fascist torturers . They should all be shot . Do you need the car , Raf ? " <p> " Take the car , " Raf said . <p> Aino fetched her purse and left the safehouse . <p> " Interesting girl , " commented Starlitz , in the sudden empty silence . " Never heard of any Finn terror groups before . Germans , French , Irish , Basques , Croats , Italians . Never Finns , though . " <p> " They 're a bit behind the times in this corner of Europe . She 's one of the new breed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard life for terrorist women . " Raf carefully sugared his coffee . " Women never get proper credit . Women kidnap ministers , women blow up trains  --  women do very well at the work . But no one calls them ' armed revolutionaries . ' They 're always  --  what does the press say ?  --  ' maladjusted female neurotics . ' Or ugly hardened lesbians with a father-figure complex . Or cute little innocents , seduced and brain-washed by the wrong sort of man . " He snorted . <p> " Why do you say that ? " Starlitz said . <p> " I 'm a man of my generation , you know . " Raf sipped his coffee . " Once , I was n't advanced in my feminist thinking . It was being close to Ulrike that raised my consciousness . Ulrike Meinhoff . A wonderful girl . Gifted journalist . Smart . Eloquent . Very ruthless . Quite good-looking . But Baader and that other one  --  what was her name ? They treated her so badly . Always yelling at her in the safehouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bourgeoisie and so forth . My God , are n't we all spoilt children of the bourgeoisie ? If the bourgeoisie had n't made a botch of us , we would n't need to kill them . " <p> A car pulled up outside . The engine died and doors slammed . <p> Starlitz walked to the front window , peeked through the blind . <p> " It 's the yuppies from next door , " he said . " Looks like they 're home early . " <p> " We should introduce ourselves , " Raf said . He began combing his hair . <p> " Uh-oh , scratch that , " Starlitz said . " That 's the guy who lives next door all right , but that 's not the woman . He 's got a different woman . " <p> " A girlfriend ? " Raf said with interest . <p> " Well , it 's a much younger woman . In a wig , net hose and red high heels . " The door in the next duplex opened and slammed . A stereo came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " This is a golden opportunity , " said Raf , shoving his coffee mug aside . " Let 's introduce ourselves now as his new neighbors . He 'll be very embarrassed . He 'll never look at us again . He 'll never question us . Also , he 'll keep his wife away from us . " <p> " That 's a good tactic , " Starlitz said . <p> " All right . Let me do the talking . " Raf went to the door . <p> " You still got that Makarov in the back of your belt , man . " <p> " Oh yes . Sorry . " Raf tossed the pistol onto the sleek Finnish couch . <p> Raf opened the front door . Then he back-stepped deftly back into the apartment and shut the door firmly . " There 's a white rental car on the street . " <p> " Yeah ? " <p> " Two men inside it . " <p> " Yeah ? " <p> " Someone just shot them . " <p> Starlitz hurried to the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . Two of them had just murdered Khoklov 's bodyguards , suddenly emptying silenced pistols through the closed glass of the windows . The street was not entirely deserted , but killing people with silenced pistols was a remarkably unobtrusive affair if done with brio and accuracy . <p> Four men began crossing the street . They wore jeans , jogging shoes , and , despite the heat , box-cut Giorgio Armani blazers . Two of them were carrying dainty little videocams . All of them were carrying guns . <p> " Zionists , " Raf announced . Briskly , but without haste , he retreated to his arsenal on the kitchen floor . He slung an AK over his shoulder , propped a second assault rifle within easy reach , then knelt around the corner of the kitchen wall , giving himself a clear line of fire at the front door . <p> Starlitz quickly weighed various possibilities . He decided to keep watching the window . <p> With swift and deadly purpose , the hit-team marched to the adioining duplex . The door broke off its hinges as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of indignant surprise , and a quiet multiple stuttering . A burst of Uzi slugs pierced the adjoining wall and embedded themselves in the floor . <p> Raf rose to his feet , his plump face the picture of glee . He touched one finger to his lips . <p> Footsteps clomped rapidly up and down the stairs in the next apartment . Doors banged , drawers opened . A bedside telephone jangled as it was knocked from its table . In three minutes the hit-team was out the door . <p> Raf scurried to the window and knelt . He 'd grabbed a small pocket Nikon from his sports bag . He clicked off a roll of snapshots as the hit squad retreated . " I 'm so tempted to shoot them , " he said , hitching the sling of his assault rifle , " but this is better . This is very funny . " <p> " That was Mossad , right ? " <p> " Yes . They thought I was the neighbor . " <p> " They must have had a description of you and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , man . That 's not good news . " <p> " Let 's phone in a credit for their hit . The Helsinki police might catch them . That would be lovely . Where is that cellphone ? " <p> " Look , we were extremely lucky just now . We 'd better leave . " <p> " I 'm always lucky . We have plenty of time . " Raf gazed at his arsenal and sighed . " I hate to abandon these guns , but we have no car to carry . them . Let 's carry the guns next door , before we go ! That should win us some nice press . " <p> Starlitz met with Khoklov at two A.M. The midnight sun had given up its doomed attempt to sink and was now rising again in refulgent splendor . The two of them were strolling the spectrally abandoned streets of Helsinki , not too far from Khoklov 's posh suite at the Arctia . <p> As European capitals went , Helsinki was a very young town . Most of it had been built since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leveled by Russian bombers in the 1940s . Nevertheless the waterfront streets looked like stage-sets for the Pied Piper of Hamelin , all copper-gabled roofs and leaded glass and quaint window turrets . <p> " I miss my boys , " Khoklov grumbled . " Why did they have to ice my boyst Stupidbastards . " <p> " Lot of Russian Jews in Israel now . Israel 's very hip to the Russian mafia scene . Maybe it was a message . " ' <p> " No . They 're just out of practice . They thought my boys were guarding Raf . They thought that poor fat Finn was Raf . Raf makes them nervous . He 's been on their hit-list since the Munich Olympics . " <p> " How 'd they know Raf was here ? " <p> " It 's those hackers at the bank . They 've been talking too much . Three of our depositors are big Israeli arms dealers . " Khoklov was tired . He 'd been up all night explaining developments by phone to an anxious cabal of millionaire ex-Chekists in Petersburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to move this into high gear , ace . " <p> " I know that only too well . " Khoklov opened a gunmetal pillbox and dry-swallowed a pink tab . " The Higher Circles in Organizatsiya  --  they love the idea of black electronic cash , but they 're old-fashioned and skeptical . They say they want quick results , and yet they give me trouble about financing . " <p> " I never expected those nomenklatura cats to come through for us , " Starlitz said . " They 're all ex-KGB bureaucrats , as slow as hell . If the Japanese shakedown works , we 'll have the capital all right . You say they want results ? What kind of results exactly ? " <p> " You 've met our golden boy now , " said Khoklov . " What did you think of him ? Be frank . " <p> Starlitz weighed his words . " I think we 're better off without him . We do n't need him for a gig like this . He 's over-qualified . " <p> " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional . And he 's always lucky . Lucky is better than good . " <p> " Look , Pulat Romanevich . We 've known each other quite a while , so I 'm going to level with you . This guy is not right for the job . This Alands coup is a business thing , we 're trying to hack the structure of multinational cash-flows . It 's the Infobahn . It 's the nineties . It 's borderless and it 's happening . It 's a high-risk start-up , sure , but so what ? All Infobahn stuff is like that . It 's global business , it 's okay . But this is not a global business guy you 've got here . This guy is a fuckin ' golem . You used to arm him and pay him way back when . I 'm sure he looked like some Che Guevara hippie poet rebel against capitalist society . But this guy is not an asset . " <p> " You think he 's crazy ? Psychopathic ? Is that it ? " <p> " Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's what he is . He 's a jackal . He feeds on dead meat from bigger crooks and spooks , and sometimes he kills rabbits . He thinks straight people are sheep . He 's got it in for consumer society . Enough to blow up our potential customers and laugh about it . The guy is a nihilist . " <p> Khoklov walked half a block in silence , shoulders hunched within his linen jacket . " You know something ? " he said suddenly . " The world has gone completely crazy . I used to fly MiGs for the Soviet Union . I dropped a lot of bombs on Moslems , and I got medals . The pay was all right . I have n't flown a jet in combat in eight years . But I loved that life . It suited me , it really did . I miss it every day . " <p> Starlitz said nothing . <p> " Now we call ourselves Russia . As if that could help us . We ca n't feed ourselves . We ca n't house ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fucking Chechnians . It 's just like with these fucking Finns ! We owned them for eighty years . Then the Finns got smart with us . So we rolled in with tanks and the sons of bitches ran into their forests in the dark and the snow , and they kicked our ass ! Even after we finally crushed them , and stole the best part of their country , they just came right back ! Now it 's fifty years later , and the Russian Federation owes Finland a billion dollars . There are only five million Finns ! My country owes every single Finn two hundred dollars each ! " <p> " It 's that Marxist thing , ace . " They walked on in silence . <p> " We 're past the Marxist thing , " said Khoklov , warming to his theme as the pill took hold . " Now it 's different . This time Russia has a kind of craziness that is truly big enough and bad enough to take over the whole world . Massive ; total , institutional corruption : Top to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute corruption that will sell anything : the flesh of our women , the future of our children . Everything inside our museums and our churches . Anything goes for money : gold , oil , arms , dope , nukes . We 'll sell the soil and the forests and the Russian sky . We 'll sell our souls . " <p> They passed the bizarre polychrome facade of a Finnish-Mexican restaurant . " Listen , ace , " Starlitz said . " If it 's the soul thing that 's got you down , this guy wo n't help you there . It was a serious mistake to break him out of mothballs . You should have left him nodding-out in some bar in Baghdad listening to Bee Gees on vinyl . I do n't know what you 'll do about him now . You might try to bribe him with some kind of major ransom money , and hope he gets too drunk to move . But I do n't think he 'll do that for you . Bribes just flatter him . " <p> " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too dangerous , and he has too much past . After the coup , we kill him . I owe that much to Ilya and Lev , anyway . " <p> " I appreciate that sentiment , but it 's kinda late now , ace . You should have iced him when we knew where he was staying . " <p> There was a distant hollow thump . <p> The Russian cocked his head . " Was that mortar fire ? " <p> " Car bomb , maybe ? " In the blue and lucid distance , filthy smoke began to rise . <p> Raf claimed that the abortive Israeli hit had been the twelfth attempt on his life . This might have been stretching the truth . It was only the second time that a Mossad hit-team had shot the wrong man in a neutral Scandinavian country . <p> Russians hated to commit themselves fully to a project . Seventy years of totalitarianism had left them with a terrific appetite for back-tracking , doublespeak and doublecross . Raf , however , delighted in providing quick <p> Granted , his Alands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd had to abandon most of his favorite guns with the loss of his first safehouse . The Mossad team had escaped apprehension by the dumbfounded Finnish police . The car-bombing at the FinnAir office had cost Raf his yellow Fiat . <p> The Suomi Anti-Imperialist Cells excelled at spraying radical political graffiti , but their homemade petrol bombs at the lyviiskyla police station had done only minor damage . The outspoken Helsinki newspaper editor had survived his kneecapping and would probably walk again . <p> Nevertheless , Raf 's ex-KGB sponsors back in Petersburg were impressed with the veteran 's initiative and can-do spirit . They 'd supplied another payoff . <p> With a brimming war-chest of mafia-supplied Euro-yen , Raf was on a roll . Raf had successfully infiltrated six Yankee mercs from the little-known but extremely violent American anarcho-rightist underground . Thanks to relaxed cross-border inspections in Europe and the dazed preoccupations of America 's ninja tobacco inspectors , these Yankee gun-runners had boldly brought Raf an up-to-date and very lethal arsenal of NATO 's remaindered best . <p> Raf also had ten Russian thugs on call . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty thousand ex-military professionals who guarded Russia 's bankers . Russian bankers who were not Mafia-affiliated were shot down in droves by the black marketeers . Russian bankers who were Mafia-affiliated were generally killed by one another . These bankers ' bodyguards were enjoying a booming trade . Being bodyguards , they naturally excelled at assassination . <p> These dangerous cliques of armed alien agitators would have been near-useless in Finland without the protection of locals on the ground . Raf had the Suomi Anti-Imperialist Cells to cover that front . The Suomi Anti-Imperialist Cells consisted of five hard-core undergraduates , plus a loose group of young fellow-travelers who would probably offer aide and shelter if pressed . The Cells also had an ideological guru , a radical Finnish nationalist professor and poet who had no real idea what his teachings had wrought among his nation 's postmodern youth . <p> So Raf had twenty or so people ready to use guns and bombs at his direction . To the uninitiated ; this might not have seemed an impressive force . However , by the conventional standards of European terrorism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , IRA , and PLO tended to be somewhat larger , due to their extensive labor-pool of the embittered and oppressed , but Raf the Jackal was a creature of a different breed : a true revolutionary internationalist , a freelance with a dozen passports . His Aland Island Liberation Front was big . It was bigger than Germany 's Baader-Meinhof . It was bigger than France 's Action Directe . It was about as big as the Japanese Red Army , and considerably better financed . A group of this sort could change history . A far more primitive conspiracy had murdered Abraham Lincoln . <p> Starlitz was listening to intemationai Finland Radio on the shortwave . It was tough to find decent English-language coverage of the ongoing terror campaign . Despite their continued selfless service in the UN blue-helmet contingent , neutral Finland did n't have a lot of foreign friends . The internal troubles of a neutral country did n't compel much general interest . <p> This would likely change , however , now that Raf had brought in outside experts . Raf was giving his Yankee new-hires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acetylene bottles . <p> Aino had rented the state-supported handicrafts center through the good offices of her student activist group . The walls of the terrorist hideaway were covered with weird woolly hangings , massive hand-saws , pine-tar soaps and eldritch Finnish glassware . <p> Aino was fully up-to-speed on improvised demolitions , so she had been appointed a look-out . She sat near a second-floor window overlooking the driveway , with a monster Finnish elk-rifle at hand . The job was tedious . Arno was leafing through a stack of English-language Fluuvin books which Starlitz had picked up at a Helsinki bookstore . Helsinki boasted bookstores half the size of aircraft hangars . The book thing was something to do during those long dark winters . <p> " How many of these did she write ? " Aino said . <p> " Twenty-five . The hottest sellers are Froofies Go to Sea and Papa Froofy and the Mushroom Tigers . " <p> " They seem even stranger in English . It 's strange that she cares so much about her little blue creatures . She worries about them so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't even really exist . " Aino flipped through the pages . " Look , here the Fluuvins are walking through the fire-mists on big stilts . That 's a good picture . And look ! There 's that cave creature that carries the harmonica and complains all the time . " <p> " That would be Sperry the Nerkulen . " <p> " Speffy the Nerkulen . " Aino frowned . " That is n't a proper Finnish name . It is n't Swedish either . Not even Aland Swedish . " <p> Starlitz turned off the shortwave , which was detailing Finnish agricultural production . " She imagined Sperry , that 's all . Sperry the Nerkulen just popped out of her little gray head . But Sperry the Nerkulen sure moves major product in Hokkaido . " <p> Aino riffled the pages of the paperback . " I could make a book like this . She wrote this book fifty years ago . She was my age when she wrote and drew this book . I could do this myself . " <p> " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because I could , I know I could . I can draw . I can tell stories . I 'm always telling stories to people at the bar . Once I did a band poster . " <p> " That 's swell . How 'd you like to come along with me and brace up the little old lady ? I need a Finnish translator , and a former Froofy fan would be great . Besides , she can give you helpful tips on kid-lit . " <p> Aino looked at him , surprised . Slowly , she frowned . " What are you saying ? I 'm a revolutionary soldier . You should respect my political commitment . You would n't talk to me that way if I was a twenty-year-old boy . " <p> " If you were a twenty-year-old boy , you 'd fuckin ' spit on Sperry the Nerkulen . " <p> " No I would n't . " <p> " Yes you would . Young soldier boys are cheaper than dirt . They 're a fuckin ' commodity . Who needs ' em ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut-out in some dicey negotiations . " <p> " You 're still lying to me . You should stop . I 'm not fooled . " <p> Starlitz sighed . " Look . It 's the truth . Try and get it straight . You think the Aland Islands are important , right ? Important enough to blow up trains for . Well , Sperry the Nerkulen is the most important thing that ever came out of the Akland Islands . Froofies are the only Alands product that you ca n't obtain anywhere else . Twenty-five thousand hick fishermen in the Baltic are doing great to produce a major worldwide pop hit like Sperry the Nerkulen . If the Alands were Jamaica , he 'd be Bob Marley . " <p> One of Raf 's new recruits entered the room . He was bearded and muscular , maybe thirty . He wore a Confederate flag T-shirt and carried a Colt automatic in a belt holster . " Hey , " he said . " Y'all speak English ? " <p> " Yo , " said Starlitz . <p> " ' Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey babe , " said the American , pausing . " That 's a lady 's rifle . You say the word , I 'll give you something serious to shoot with . " <p> Aino said nothing . Her grip tightened on the rifle 's polished walnut stock . <p> The American grinned at Starlitz . " She 's got no English , huh ? She 's a Russian , right ? I heard there 'd be lots of Russian chicks in this operation . Man . What a dollar 'll do these days . " He rubbed his hands . <p> " Posse Comitatus ? " Starhtz hazarded . <p> " Aw hell no . We 're not militia . Those militia boys , they 're all in a sweat over UN black helicopters and the New World Order . . . . That 's bullshit ! We know the New World Order . We got contacts . We 're gon na be inside the goddamn black helicopters . Shoulder to shoulder with Ivan , this time ! " <p> Finland had the most expensive booze in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and parcel with the world 's lowest infant mortality rate . Nevertheless , Finns were truly fabulous drunks . The little Kasarmikatu bar was jammed with Finns methodically transiting from modest self-effacement to chest-pounding no-brakes bravado . A television barked above the shining racks of vodka and koskenkorva , showing broadcast news from across the Baltic . Another Parliamentary crisis in Moscow . A furious Russian delegate was pounding the podium in a blue vinyl iacket and a Megadeth T-shirt . <p> The Japanese financier set down his apple juice and adjusted his sunglasses . " His Holiness the Master does not approve of drunkenness . Alcohol clouds the vision and occludes the flow of ki . " <p> " I ca n't believe we found a Japanese who wo n't drink after a business deal , " Khoklov bitched in Russian . The Japanese money-man did n't speak or understand Russian . The three of them were clustered in the darkest comer of the Helsinki bar . <p> Starlitz spoke in Russian . " Our star depositor here has got a very severe case of that Pacific Rim New Age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , they 're richer than God . " <p> Starlitz silently toasted the money-man with a shot of Finnish cranberry vodka . He 'd convinced their backer that this pulverizing liquor was cranberry juice . He switched to fluent gutter Japanese . " Khoklov-san tells me that he admires your electric skullcap very much . He wants to try one for himself . He is seeking health benefits and increased peace of mind . " <p> " Saaaaa . . . " riposted Mr. Inoue , patting the plasticized top of his shaven head . " The electroneural stabilizers of His Holiness the Master . They will soon be in mass production at our Fuji fortress . " <p> " You got like a kids ' version of those , right ? " said Starlitz . <p> " Of course . His Holiness the Master has many children . " <p> " So have you ever considered , like , a pop commercial version of those gizmos ? Like with maybe a fully licensed cartoon character ? " <p> Mr Inoue blinked . " I was led to understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " The son of a bitch is on about the helicopters again , " Starlitz explained in Russian . <p> Khoklov grunted . " Tell him we have a special on T-72 main battle tanks . Twenty million yen apiece . Just for him though . No resales . " <p> Starlitz conferred at length with Mr. Inoue . " He 's not interested in tanks . He wants at least six Mil- 17 choppers with poison gas dispensers . Also some Spetsnaz Ranger vets to train the cult 's judo commando unit on their sacred island of Ishigakijima . " <p> " Spetsnaz veterans ? Very well . We 've got plenty . Tell him he 'll have to find them visas and put up ' earnest money . Those black berets are n't your average goons . " <p> Starlitz conferred again . " He wants to know if you know anything about laser ablation uranium-enrichment techniques . " <p> " Nyet . And I 'm getting pretty tired of that question . " <p> " He wants to know if you 're interested in learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Industries . " <p> Khoklov groaned . " Tell him I appreciate the lead on industrial atomic espionage , but that crap went out with Klaus Fuchs and the Rosenbergs . " <p> Starlitz sighed . " Let 's give lnoue-san a little face here , Pulat Romanevich . His Holiness the Master predicts the world will end in 1997 . We play along with the cult 's loony apocalypse myths , and we can lock in their deposits all the way through winter ' 96 . " <p> " Why do we need this plastic-headed lunatic ? " Khoklov said . " He 's a crooked exploiter of the gullible masses . He 's running dummy companies inside Russia and recruiting Russian suckers for his ridiculous yoga cult . He needs us more than we need him . He 's a long way from home . Put the strong-arm on him . " <p> " Listen , ace . We need the cult 's deposit money , because we need that yen disparity to cover the flow of black capital . Besides , I 'm the Tokyo liaison for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees inside Russia , but back in Japan , his pals are building big stainless-steel bunkers full of giant microwaves . " <p> " There are limits to my credulity , you know , " Khoklov said testily . " Botulism breweries ? Nerve gas factories ? Hundreds of brainwashed New Age robots building computer chips for a half-blind master criminal in white pajamas ? It 's completely absurd , it 's like something out of James Bond . Please inform this clown that he 's dealing with real-life professionals . " <p> Starlitz raised his hand and signaled . " Check please . " <p> " Here you are sir , " said Aino : " I hope you and your foreign friends are enjoying your stay in hospitable Helsinki . " <p> After the helsinki disco bombing , Raf moved his center of operations to the Alands proper . The hardworking youngsters of the S.A-I.C. had found him another bolthole  --  a sauna retreat in the dense woods of Kokar island . This posh resort belonged to a Swedish arms corporation who had once used it to entertain members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Alands had assured them privacy and avoided potential political embarrassments on Swedish soil . This Swedish company had fallen on hard times due to the massive Russian bargain-basement armaments sales . They were happy to sublet their resort to Khoklov 's well-heeled shell company . <p> " We ca n't all be Leninist ascetics , " Raf declared cheerily . " One can still be a revolutionary in decent shoes . " <p> " Decent shoes count for plenty in Russia these days , " Starlitz agreed . <p> Raf leaned back in his lacquered bentwood chair . The resort 's central office , with its stained glass windows and maniacally sleek Alvar Aalto fumiture , seemed to suit him very well . " We 've reached a delicate stage of the revolutionary process , " Raf said , lacing his fingers behind his head . " Integrating the dual strike-forces of the liberation front . " <p> " You mean introducing your Yankee guys to your Russian guys ? " <p> " Yes . And what better neutral ground for that encounter than the traditional Finnish sauna ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! No clothes . No guns ! Just fresh clean steam . And plenty of booze . And since the boys have been training so hard , I 've prepared them a nice surprise . " <p> " Women . " <p> Raf chuckled . " They are soldiers , you know . " He leaned forward onto the desk . " Did you examine this resort ? We have certain expectations to keep up ! " <p> Starlitz had examined the resort and the grounds . There had been more hookers through the place than Bofors had heavy . machine guns . The grounds were private and extensive . Coups had been launched successfully from less likely places . <p> Starlitz nodded . " I get the drill . You know that I have a business appointment with that little old lady today . You set this up this way on purpose , just so I 'd miss all the fun . " <p> Raf paused , and thought this over . " You 're not angry with me , are you , Starlitz ? " <p> " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be angry with me ? I 'm loaning you Aino . Is n't that enough ? I did n't have to give you a translator for your business scam . I 'm trusting you , all alone on a little boat , with my favorite lieutenant . You should be grateful . " <p> Starlitz stared at him . " Man , you 're too good to me . " <p> " You should look after Aino . My little jackal has been under strain . I know you are fond of her . Since you took such pains to speak with her behind my back . " <p> " No , I 'll leave her here with you tonight , " Starlitz offered . " Let 's see what your twenty naked , drunken mercs will do with a heavily armed poetry major . " <p> Raf sighed in mock defeat . " Starlitz , you do n't bullshit as easily as most really greedy people . " <p> " Good of you to notice , man . " <p> " Of course , I do want you to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she would misinterpret this . Let 's be very frank . These men I bought for us  --  they are brutal men who kill and die for pay . They must be given rewards and punishments that they can understand . They 're whores with guns . " <p> " I 'm always happiest when I know the worst , Raf . You have n't told me the worst yet . " <p> " Why should I confide in you ? You never confide in me . " Raf pushed an ashtray across the desk . " Have a cigarette . " <p> Starlitz took a Gauloise . <p> Raf lit it with a flourish , then lit his own . " You talk a lot , Starlitz , " he said . " You bargain well . But you never talk about yourself . Everything I discovered about you , I have found out through other people . " Raf coughed a bit . " For instance , I know that you have a daughter . A daughter that you 've never seen . " <p> " Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have photos . She 's not like you . She 's cute . " <p> " You 've got photos , man ? " Starlitz sat up . " Video ? " <p> " Yes , I have photos . I have more than that . I have contacts in America who know where your daughter is living . She lives with those strange West Coast women . " <p> " Yeah , well , I admit they 're plenty strange , but it 's one of those postnuclear family things , " Starlitz said at last . <p> " Would you like to meet your daughter ? I could snatch her and deliver her to you here in the Alands . That would be easy . " <p> " The arrangement 's not so bad as it stands , " Starlitz said . " They let me send her kids'books . . . . " <p> Raf put his sock-clad feet on the desk . " Maybe you need to settle down , Starlitz . When a man gets to a certain age , he has to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basically , I 'm a family man . " <p> " Wow . " <p> " That 's right . I 've been married for twenty years . My wife 's in a French prison . They caught her in ' 78 . " <p> " That 's a long stretch . " <p> " I have two children . One by my wife , one by a girl in Beirut . People think a man like Raf the Jackal must have no private life . They do n't give me credit for my dreams . Did you know I 've written journalism ? I 've even written poetry . Poetry in Italian and Arabic . " <p> " You do n't say . " <p> " Oh , but I do say . I will say more , since it 's just the two of us . No Russians here at the resort yet , to set up their tiresome bugging networks . . . . I have a good feeling about you , Stalitz . You and I , we 're both postmodern men of the world . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with silly old Karl Marx , you know . " <p> " Could be , man . " <p> " It was the 1990s at work . Breaking up is very infective . It 's everywhere now . It 's out of control , like AIDS . Did you ever meet a Lebanese warlord ? Jumblatt , perhaps ? Berri ? Splendid fellows . Men like lions . " <p> " Never met " em . " <p> " That 's a very good life , you know  --  becoming a warlord . It 's what happens to terrorists when they grow up . " <p> Starlitz nodded It was a very dangerous thing to have Raf so worried about his good opinion , but he could n't help but be pleased . <p> " You seize a port , " Raf explained . " You grow dope . You buy guns . It 's like a little nation , but you do n't need any lawyers , or any bureaucrats , or any ad-men , or any stupid bastards in suits . You have the guns , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , and they run and do it . Maybe it ca n't last forever . But as long as it lasts , it 's heaven . " <p> " This is good , Raf . You 're leveling with me now . I appreciate that , I really do . " <p> " The press says that I like to kill people . Well , of course I like to kill people ! It 's thrilling . It gives your life a heroic dimension . If it was n't thrilling to kill people , people would n't buy tickets to movies where people are killed . But if I wanted to kill , I 'd go to Chechnya , Georgia , Abkhazia . That 's not the trick . Any idiot can become a warlord inside a war zone . The trick is to become a warlord where people are fat and soft and rich ! You want to become a warlord just outside a massive , disintegrating empire . This is the perfect spot ! I know I 've had my little setbacks in the past . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to win , and keep what I win ! I 'm going to seize these little islands . I 'll declare martial law and rule by decree . " <p> " What about your three-man provisional government ? " <p> " I 've decided those boys are not reliable . I did n't like the way they talked about me . So , I 'll short-cut the process , and produce very quick and decisive results . I 'll take twenty-five thousand people hostage . " <p> " How do you manage that ? " <p> " How ? By claiming that I have a Russian low-yield nuke , which in fact I do n't . But who would dare to try my bluff ? I 'm Raf the Jackal ! I 'm the famous Raf ! They know I 'm capable of that . " <p> " Low yield nuke , huh ? I guess the old terrie scenarios are the good ones . . . . " <p> " Of course I do n't have any such nuke . But I do have ten kilos of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or whatever silly scientific thing those SWAT squads use  --  that will look very convincing . The Finns wo n't dare risk another Chernobyl . They still glow in the dark from that last one . So I 'm being very reasonable , do n't you agree ? I 'm only asking for a few small islands and a few thousand people . I 'll observe the proper niceties , if they allow me that . I 'll make a nice flag and some coinage . " <p> Starlitz rubbed his chin . " The coinage thing should be especially interesting given the electronic bank angle . " <p> Raf opened a desk drawer and produced a shotglass and a duty-free bottle of Finnish cloudberry liqueur . The booze in the Alands was vastly cheaper than Finland 's . " Singapore is only a little island , " Raf said , squinting as he poured himself a shot . " Nobody ever complains about Singapore 's nuclear weapon . " <p> " I had n't heard that , man . " <p> " Of course they have one ! They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uranium from the South Africans during apartheid , when the Boers were desperate for money . And they built the trigger themselves . Singaporeans will take that kind of trouble . They are very industrious . " <p> " Makes sense to me . " Starlitz paused . " I 'm still getting a general handle on your proposal . Give me the long-term vision , Raf . Let 's say that you get what you want , and they somehow let you keep it . What then ? Give me ten years down the road . " <p> " People always asked me that question , " Raf said , sipping . " You want one of these cloudberries ? Little golden berries off the Finnish tundra , it surprises me how sweet they are . " <p> " No thanks , but do n't let me stop you , man . " <p> " In the old days , people would ask me  --  mostly these were hostage negotiators , all the talking would get old and we 'd all get rather philosophical sometimes . . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 'd say to me , Raf , what about this Revolution of yours ? What kind of world are you really trying to give us ? I 've had a long time to consider that question . " <p> " And ? " <p> " Did you ever hear the Jimi Hendrix rendition of ' The Star-Spangled Banner ? ' " <p> Starlitz blinked . " Are you kidding ? That cut still moves major product off the back catalog . " <p> " Next time , really listen to that piece of music . Try to imagine a country where that music truly was the national anthem . Not weird , not far-out , not hip , not a parody , not a protest against some war , not for young Yankees stoned on some stupid farm in New York . Where music like that was social reality . That is how I want people to live . People are sheep , and they do n't have the guts to live that way . But if I get a chance , I can make them do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as much fun as driving.Raf 's had stolen from Copen hagen and motored it across the Baltic at high speed . Since it was a classic dope-smuggler 's vehicle , the Danish cops would assume it had been hijacked by dope people . They would n't be far wrong . <p> Starlitz examined the nautical map . <p> ' I shot a cop today , " Aino said . <p> Starlitz looked up . " Why do you say that ? " <p> " I shot a cop dead . It was the constable in Mariehamm . I went into his little office . I told him someone stole the spare tire from my car . I took him around the back of his little office to see my car . I opened the trunk , and when he looked inside for the tire , I shot him . Three times . No , four times . He fell right into the trunk . So I threw him in the trunk and shut it . Then I drove away with him . " <p> Starlitz folded the nautical map very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " No . Raf says it 's better if we disappear the cop . We 'll say he that defected back to Finland with the secret police files . That will be a good propaganda coup . " <p> " You really iced this guy ? Where 's the body ? " <p> " It 's in this boat , " Aino said . <p> " Take the wheel , " said Starlitz . He left the cockpit and looked into the launch 's fiberglass hold . There was a very dead man in uniform in it . <p> Starlitz turned to her . " Raf sent you to ice him all by yourself ? " <p> " No , " said Aino proudly , " he sent Matti and Jorma with me , but I made them keep watch outside . " She paused . " People lie when they say it 's hard to kill . Killing is very simple . You move your finger three times . Or four times . You imagine doing it , and then you plan it , and then you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you plan to deal with the evidence here ? " <p> " We wrap the body in chains that I bought in the hardware store . We drop him into the Baltic between here and the little old lady 's island . Here , take the wheel . " <p> Starlitz went back to piloting . Aino hauled the dead cop out of the hold . The corpse outweighed her considerably , but she was strong and determined , and only occasionally squeamish . She hauled the heavy steel chains around the corpse with a series of methodical rattles , stopping every few moments to click them tight with cheap padlocks . <p> Starlitz watched this procedure while managing the wheel . " Was it Raf 's idea to send along a corpse with my negotiations ? " <p> Aino looked up gravely . " This is the only boat we have . I had to use this boat . We do n't seize the ferries until later . " <p> " Raf likes to send a message . " <p> " This is my message . I killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a uniformed agent from the occupying power . He 's a legitimate hard target . " Aino tossed back her braids , and sighed . " Take me seriously , Mister Starlitz . I 'm a young woman , and I dress like a punk because I like to , and maybe I read too many books . But I mean what I say . I believe in my cause . I come from a small obscure country , and my group is a small obscure group . That does n't matter , because we are committed . We truly are an armed revolutionary strike force . I 'm going to overthrow the government here and take over this country . I killed an oppressor today . That is a duty of an armed revolutionary . " <p> " So you take the islands by force . Then what ? " <p> " Then we 'll be rid of these Aland ethnics . They 'll be on their own . After that , we Finns can truly be Finns . We 'll become a truly Finnish nation , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Then we move into the Finno-Ugric lands that the Russians stole from us ! We can take back Karelia . And Komi . And Kanti-Mansiysk . " She looked at him and scowled . " You 've never even heard of those places . Have you ? They 're sacred to us . They 're in the Kalevala . But you , you 've never even heard of them . . . . " <p> " What happens after that ? " <p> She shrugged . " is that my problem ? I 'll never see that dream fulfilled : I think the cops will kill me before then . What do you think ? " <p> " I think these are gon na be kind of touchy book-contract negotiations . " <p> " Stop worrying , " Aino said . " You worry too much about trivial things . " She gave a last methodical wrap of the chain , and heaved the dead cop overboard . The corpse bobbed face-down in the wake of the boat , then slowly sank from sight . <p> Aino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the racing seawater . " Just talk slowly to her , " she said . " The old lady writes in Swedish , did you know that ? I found out all about her . That 's her first language , Swedish . But they say her Finnish is very good . For an dander . " <p> Starlitz pulled up at the little wooden dock . The entire island , shored in weed-slimed dark granite , was about twenty acres . The little old lady lived here with her even older and hailer brother . They 'd both been born on the island , and had originally lived with their parents , but the father had died in 1950 and the mother in 1968 . <p> The only access to the island was by boat . There were no phones , no electricity and no plumbing . The home was a two-story stone mansion with a steep slate roof , a stone well and a wooden outhouse . The eaves were carved and painted in yellow and red . There were some chickens and a couple of squat little island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with an oil lantern . A lot of seagulls around . <p> Starlitz yelled a loud ahoy from the dock , which seemed the most polite approach , but there was no answer from the house . So they trudged up across the rocks and turf , and found the mansion 's door and knocked . No response . <p> Starlitz tried the salt-warped door . It was unlocked . The windows were open and a faint breeze was playing through the parlor . There were hundreds of shelved books in Finnish and Swedish , some fluttering papers , and quite a few cheerily demented oil paintings . Some quite handsome bronze statuary and some framed Finnish theater posters from the 1930s . A wind-up Victrola . <p> Starlitz opened the hall closet and looked at the rough weather gear - oilskins and boots . " You know something ? This little old lady is as tail as a house . She 's a goddamned Viking . " He left the parlor for the composition room . He found a wooden secretary and a fine velvet chair . Dictionaries , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collections . " There 's nothing in here , " he muttered . <p> " What are you looking for ? " said Aino . <p> " I du n no exactly . Something to explain how this works . " <p> " Here 's a note ! " Arno called . <p> Starlitz went back into the parlor . He took the note , which had been written in copperplate longhand on lined Sperry the Nerkulen novelty notepaper . <p> " Dear Mister Staffins , " read the note , " Please pardon my not here being . I go to Helsingfors to testify . I go to Suomi Parliament as long needing for civic duty call . I regret I must miss you and hoping to speak with you about my many readers in Tokio another much more happier time . Sorry you must row so far and not have meet . Please help your self(s) to tea and biscuits all ready in kitchen . Goodbye ! " <p> " She 's gone to Helsinki , " Starlitz said . <p> " She never travels any more . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have saved us a lot of trouble if she had a cellphone . " <p> " Why would they want her in Helsinki ? " <p> " Oh , they made her go there , I suppose . The local Alanders . The local collaborationist power structure . " <p> " What good do they think she can do ? She 's not political . " <p> " That 's true , but they are very proud of her here . After all , the children 's clinic  --  The Fluuvin 's Children 's Clinic in Foglo ?  --  that was hers . " <p> " Yeah ? . " <p> " Also the park in Sottunga . The Fluuvin Park in Brando and the Grand Fluuvin Festival Playground . She built all of those . She never keeps the money . She gives the money away . Mostly to the Fluuvin Pediatric Disease Foundation . " <p> Starlitz pulled off his shades and wiped his forehead . " You would n't know exactly which pediatric diseases in particular have caught her fancy , right ? " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really , it must be a mental illness . A childless spinster from the unjust social order . . . Denied any healthy sex life or outlets . . . . Living as a hermit with all her silly books and paintings all these years . . . No wonder she 's gone mad . " <p> " Okay , we 're going back , " Starlitz said . " I 've had it . " <p> Raf and Starlitz were outside in the woods , slapping at the big slow-moving Scandinavian mosquitoes . " I thought we had an understandings " Raf said , over a muffled chorus of bestial howls from the sauna . " I told you not to bring her back here . " <p> " She 's your lieutenant , Raf . You straighten her out . " <p> " You could have been more tactful . Invent some little deception . " <p> " I did n't wan na get dumped off the boat . " Starlitz scratched his bitten neck . " I face a very serious kink in my negotiations , man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market window . This is Japanese pop culture we 're talking here . The Japanese run product cycles in hyperdrive . They can burn out a consumer vogue in four weeks flat . There 's nobody saying that Froofies will move long-term product like Smurfs or Seuss . " <p> " I understand your financial difficulties with your Tokyo backers . If you can just be patient . We can take steps . We 'll innovate . If necessary the Republic of the Alands will nationalize literary production . " <p> " Man , the point of this thing is to sue the guys in Japan who are already ripping her off . We got ta have something on paper that looks strong enough to stand up and bark in the courts in The Hague . You gon na strong-arm people anywhere over vaporous crap like intellectual property , it 's got ta look heavy-duty , or they do n't back off . " <p> " Now you 're frightening me , " Raf said . " You should take a little time in the sauna . Relax . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that goddamn steam , Raf ? " <p> Raf nodded . " These are some very special videos . " <p> " I fuckin ' hate videos , man . " <p> " They 're Bosnian videos . " <p> " Really ? " <p> " Not easy to obtain . They 're from the camps . " <p> " You 're showing those mercs atrocity videos ? " <p> Raf spread his arms . " Welcome to 21st Century Europe ! " he shouted at the empty shoreline . " Brand-new European apartheid regimes ! Where gangs of war criminals abduct and systematically rape women from other ethnic groups . While the studio lights blaze and the minicams roll ! " <p> " I 'd heard those rumors , " Starlitz said slowly . " Pretty hard to believe them though . " <p> " You go inside that sauna , and you 'll believe those videos . It 's quite incredible , but it 's all quite real . You might not enjoy them very much , but you need to see this video documentation . You must come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political developments . It 's video that is like raw meat . " <p> " Must be faked , man . " <p> Raf shook his head . " Europeans always say that . They always ignore the rumors . They always discover the atrocities when it is five years too late . Then they act very shocked and concerned . Those videos exist , my friend . I 've got them . And I 've got more than that . I 've got some of the women . " <p> " You 're kidding . " <p> " I bought the women . I bartered them for a pair of Stinger missiles . Fifteen Bosnian abductees . I had them shipped up here in sealed cargo trucks . I went to a lot of trouble . " <p> " White slavery , man ? " <p> " I 'm not particular about color . It was n't me who enslaved them . I 'm the man who saved their lives . There were many other girls who were more stubborn or , who knows , probably less pretty . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs of their heads . These women are survivors . I wish I had more than fifteen of them , but I 'm only getting started . " Raf smiled . " Fifteen human souls ! I rescued fifteen people ! Do you know that 's more people than I 've ever personally killed ? " <p> " What are you going to do with these women ? " <p> " They 'll entertain my loyal troops , first of all . I needed them for that , which gave me the idea . I admit this : it 's very hard work in the sex-labor industry . But under my care , at least they wo n't be shot afterwards . " <p> Raf strolled along the rocky shoreline to the edge of the resort 's dock . It was a nice dock , well-outfitted . The fiberglass speed launch was tied up to one rubber-padded edge of it , but the dock could have handled a minor cruise ship . <p> " Those women will be grateful . Here , we will admit they exist ! They have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people like them . After ten years of civil war , they sell slaves openly now in the Sudan . Kurds are gassed like vermin by Iraqis and shot out of hand by Turks . The Sinhalese are killing Tamils . We ca n't forget East Timor . All over the planet , groups of little people are quietly vanishing . You can find them cowering , hiding all around the world , without papers , without legal identities . . . . The world 's truly stateless people . My kind of people . But these are rich little islands  --  where there is room for thousands of them . " <p> " This is a serious new wrinkle to the scheme , man . Did you clear it with Petersburg ? " <p> " This development does not require debate , " Raf said loftily . " It is a moral decision . People should not be killed in pogroms , by brutes who hate them merely because they are different . As a revolutionary idealist , I refuse to stomach such atrocities . These oppressed people need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Kind of a personality-cult thing then . " <p> Raf shook his long-haired head in sorrow . " Oh you 'd prefer them all quietly dead , I suppose ! Like everyone else in the modern world who never lifts a hand to help them ! " <p> " What if the locals complain ? " <p> " I 'll make the aliens into citizens . I 'll have them out-vote all the locals . A warlord , justly voted into power by the will of the majority  --  would n't that be lovely ? I 'll raise a postmodern Statue of Liberty for the world 's huddled masses . Not like that pious faker in New York Harbor . Refugees are n't vermin , even if the rich despise them . They 're displaced human beings without a place to rally . Let them rally here with me ! By the time I leave power  --  years from now , when I 'm old and gray  --  they 'll be accomplishing great works in these little islands . " <p> The hookers arrived on a fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's fastest-growing hooker economy , Russia . They might have been women from the Baltic States . They looked like Slavic women at any rate . When they climbed from the trawler they looked rather seasick , but they seemed resolved . Not panicked , not aghast , not crushed by terror . Just like a group of fifteen more-or-less-young women , in microskirts and spandex , about to go through the hard work of having sex with strangers . <p> Starlitz was unsurprised to find Khoklov shepherding the hookers . Khoklov was accompanied by two brand-new bodyguards . The number of people aware of Raf 's location was necessarily kept small . <p> " I hate working as a pimp , " Khoklov groaned . He had been drinking on the boat . " At times like these , I truly know I 've become a criminal . " <p> " Raf says these girls are Bosnian slave labor . What 's the scoop ? " <p> Khoklov started in surprise . " What do you mean ? What do you take me for ? These girls are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Lekhi watched carefully as the bodyguards shepherded their charges toward the whooping brutes inside the sauna . " That sure sounds like Serbo-Croatian those girls are talking , ace . " <p> " Nonsense . That 's Estonian . Do n't pretend you can understand Estonian . Nobody understands that Finno-Ugric jabber . " <p> " Raf told me these women are Bosnians . Says he bought them and he 's going to keep them . Why would he say that ? " <p> " Raf was joking with you . " <p> " What do you mean , ' joking ? ' He says they 're victims from a rapists ' gulag ! There 's nothing funny about that ! There just is n't any way to make that funny . " <p> Khoklov gazed at Starlitz in mournful astonishment . " Lekhi , why do you want gulags to be ' funny ' ? Gulags are n't funny . Pogroms are n't funny . War is not funny . Rape is never funny . Human life is very hard , you see . Men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that , man . " <p> Khoklov looked him over , then slowly shook his head . " No , Lekhi , you do n't know that . You just do n't know it the way that a Russian knows it . " <p> Starlitz considered this . It seemed inescapably true . " Did you ask those girls if they were from Bosnia ? " <p> " Why would I ask them that ? You know the official Kremlin line on the Yugoslav conflict . Yeltsin says that our fellow Orthodox Slavs are incapable of such crimes . Those rape-camp stories are alarmist libels spread by Catholic Croats and Bosnian Muslims . Relax , Lekhi . These women here today , they are all Estonian professionals . You can have my word on that . " <p> " Raf just gave me his word in a form that was highly otherwise . " <p> Khoklov looked him in the eye . " Lekhi , who do you believe : some hippie terrorist , or a seasoned KGB officer and member in good standing of the Russian mafia ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay , Pulat Romanevich . . . . For a moment there , I was actually considering taking some kind of , you know , action Well , never mind . Lemme get to the point . Our bank deal is falling apart . " <p> Khoklov was truly shocked . " What do you mean ? You ca n't be serious . We 're doing wonderfully . Petersburg loves us . " <p> " I mean that the old lady ca n't be bought . She 's just too far away to touch . The deal is dead meat , ace . I do n't know just how the momentum died , but I can sure smell the decay . This situation is not sustainable , man . I think it 's time you and me got the hell out of here . " <p> " You could n't get your merchandising deal ? That 's a pity , Lekhi . But never mind that . I 'm sure we can find some other capitalization scheme that 's just as quick and just as cheap . There 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole set-up stinks . It was the video thing that tipped me off . Pulat , did I ever tell you about the fact that I , personally , never show up on video ? " <p> " What 's that , Lekhi ? " <p> " At least , I did n't used to . Back in the eighties , if you pointed a video camera at me it would crack , or split , or the chip would blow . I just never registered on videotape . " <p> Slowly , Khoklov removed a silver flask from within his suit jacket . He had a long contemplative glug , then shuddered violently . He focused his eyes on Starlitz with weary deliberation . " I beg your pardon . Would you repeat that , please ? " <p> " It 's that whole video thing man . That 's why I got into the online business in the first place . Originally , I was a very analog kind of guy . But the video surveillance was seriously getting me down . I could n't even walk down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off half a dozen goddamn videos . But then  --  I discovered online anonymity . Online encryption . Online pseudonymity . That really helped my personal situation . Now I had a way to stay underground , stay totally unknown , even when I was being observed and monitored twenty-four hours a day . I found a way that I could go on being myself . " <p> " Lekhi , are you drunk ? " <p> " Nyet . Pay attention , ace . I 'm leveling with you here . " <p> " Did Raf give you something to drink ? " <p> " Sure . We had a coffee earlier . " <p> " Lekhi , you 're on drugs . Do you have a gun ? Give it to me now . " <p> " Raf gave all the guns to the Suomi kids . They 're keeping the guns still the mercs sober up . Simple precaution . " <p> " Maybe you 're still jetlagged . It 's hard to sleep properly when the sun never sets . You should go lie down . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of fucking wimp who does n't know when he 's on acid . Normal people 's rules just do n't apply to me , that 's all . I 'm not a normal guy . I 'm Leggy Starlitz , I 'm a very , very strange guy . That 's why I tend to end up in situations like this . " Starlitz ran his hand over his sweating scalp . " Lemme put it this way . You remember that mafia chick you were banging back in Azerbaijan ? " <p> Khoklov took a moment to access the memory . " You mean the charming and lovely Tamara Akhmedovna ? " <p> " That 's right . The wife of the Party Secretary . I leveled with Tamara in a situation like this . I told her straight-out that her little scene was coming apart . I could n't tell her why , but I just knew it . At the time , she did n't believe me , either . Just like you 're not believing me , now . You know where Tamara Akhmedovna is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles . " <p> Khoklov had gone pale . " All right , " he said . He whipped the cellular from an inner pocket of his jacket . " Do n't tell me any more . I can see you have a bad feeling . Let me make some phone calls . " <p> " You want Tamara 's phone number ? " <p> " No . Do n't go away . And do n't do anything crazy . All I ask is  --  just let me make a few contacts . " Khoklov began punching digits . <p> Starlitz walked by the sauna . Four slobbering , buck-naked drunks dashed out and staggered down the trail in front of him . Their pale sweating hides were covered with crumpled green birch leaves from Finnish sauna whisks . They plunged into the chilly sea with ecstatic grunts of ambiguous pain . <p> Somewhere inside , the New World Order comrades were singing Auld Lang Syne . The Russians were having a hard time finding the beat . <p> Raf was enjoying a snooze in the curvilinear Aalto barcalounger when Khoklov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betrayed , " Khoklov announced . <p> " Oh ? " said Raf . " Where ? Who is the traitor ? " <p> " Our superiors , unfortunately . " <p> Raf considered this , rubbing his eyelids . " Why do you say that ? " <p> " They liked our idea very much , " Khoklov said . " So they stole it from us . " <p> " Intellectual piracy , man , " Starlitz said . " It 's a bad scene . " <p> " The Alands deal is over , " Khoklov said . " The Organizatsiya 's Higher Circles have decided that we have too much initiative . They want much closer institutional control of such a wonderful idea . Our Finnish hacker kids have jumped ship and joined them . They re-routed all the Suns to Kaliningrad . " <p> " What is Kaliningrad ? " Raf said . <p> " It 's this weird little leftover piece of Russia on the far side of all three independent Baltic nations , " Starlitz said helpfully . " They say they 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old Hong Kong is about to be metabolized by the Chinese , so the Mafia figures it 's time for Russia to sprout one . They 'll make this little Kaliningrad outpost into a Baltic duty-free zone cum European micro-buffer state . And they 're paying our Finn hacker kids three times what we pay , plus air fare . " <p> " The World Bank is helping them with development loans , " Khoklov said . " The World Bank loves their Kaliningrad idea . " <p> " Plus the European Union , man . Euros love duty-free zones . " <p> " And the Finns too , " Khoklov said . " That 's the very worst of it . The Finns have bought us out . Russia used to owe every Finn two hundred dollars . Now , Russia owes every Finn one hundred and ninety dollars . In return for a rotten little fifty million dollar write-off , my bosses sold us all to the Finns . They told the Finns about our plans , and they sold us just as if we were some lousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tactics team is flying over here right now to annihilate us . " <p> Raf 's round and meaty face grew dark with fury . " So you 've betrayed us , Khoklov ? " <p> " It 's my bosses who let us down , " Khoklov said sturdily . " Essentially , I 've been purged . They have cut me out of the Organizatsiya . They liked the idea much more than they like me . So I 'm expendable . I 'm dead meat . " <p> Raf turned to Starlitz . " I 'll have to shoot Pulat Romanevich for this . You realize that , I hope . " <p> Starlitz raised his brows . " You got a gun , man ? " <p> " Aino has the guns . " Raf hopped up from his lounger and left . <p> Khoklov and Starlitz hastily followed him . " You 're going to let him shoot me ? " Khoklov said sidelong . <p> " Look man , the guy has kept us his end . He always delivered on time and within specs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had her elk rifle . <p> " Where 's the arsenal ? " Raf demanded . <p> " I had Matti and Jorma take all the weapons from this property . Your mercenaries are terrible beasts , Raf . " <p> " Of course they 're beasts , " Raf said . " That 's why they follow a Jackal . Lend me your rifle for a moment , my dear . i have to shoot this Russian . " <p> Aino slammed a thumb-sized cartridge into the breech and stood up . " This is my favorite rifle . I do n't give it to anyone . " <p> " Shoot him yourself , then , " Raf said , backing up half a step with a deft little hop . " His Mafia people have blown the Movement 's program . They 've betrayed us to the Finnish oppressors . " <p> " Police are coming from the mainland , " Starlitz told her . " It 's over . Time to split , girl . Let 's get out of here . " <p> Aino ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be trusted , " she said to Raf . Her face was pale , but composed . " What did American mercenaries have to do with Finland ? We could have done this easily , if you were not so ambitious . " <p> " A man has to dream , " Raf said . " Everybody needs a big dream . " <p> Aino centered her rifle on Khoklov 's chest . " Should I shoot you . " she asked him , in halting Russian . <p> " I 'm not a cop , " Khoklov offered hopefully . <p> Aino thought about it . The rifle did not waver . " What will you do , if I do n't shoot you ? " <p> " I have no idea what I 'll do , " Khoklov said , surprised . " What do you plan to do , Raf ? " <p> " Me ? " said Raf . " Why , I could kill you with these hands alone . " He held out his plump , dimpled hands in karate position . <p> " Lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of angry Finnish SWAT team , " Starlitz said . <p> Raf squared his shoulders . " I 'd love to take a final armed stand on this territory ! Battle those Finnish oppressors to the death ! However , unfortunately , I have no arsenal . " <p> " Run away , Raf , " Aino said . <p> " What 's that , my dear ? " said Raf . <p> " Run , Raffi . Run for your life . I 'll stay here with your stupid hookers , and your drunken , naked , mercenary losers , and when the cops come , I 'm going to shoot some of them . " <p> " That 's not a smart survival move , " Starlitz told her . <p> " Why should I run like you ? Should I let my revolution collapse at the first push from the authorities , without even a token resistance ? This is my sacred cause ! " <p> " Look , you 're one little girl , " Starlitz said . <p> " So what ? They 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , in a drunken stupor . The cops will put them all in handcuffs , just like that . But not me . I 'll be fighting I 'll be shooting . Maybe they 'll kill me . They 're supposed to be good , these SWAT cops . Maybe they 'll capture me alive . Then , I 'll just have to live inside a little stone house . All by myself . For a long , long time . But I 'm not afraid of that ! I have my cause . I was right ! I 'm not afraid . " <p> " You know , " said Khoklov brightly , " if we took that speed launch we could be on the Danish coast in three hours . " <p> Spray whipped their faces as the Alands faded in the distance . <p> " I hope there are n't too many passport checks in Denmark , " Khoklov said anxiously . <p> " Passports are n't a problem , " Raf said . " Not for me . Or for my friends . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , " said Raf , " perhaps the Alands offshore bank scheme was a little before its time . I 'm a visionary , you know . I was always twenty years ahead of my time  --  but nowadays maybe I 'm only twenty minutes . " Raf sighed . " Such a wonderful girl , Aino ! She reminded me so much of . . . well , there have been so many wonderful girls . . . . But I must sacrifice my habit of poetic dreaming ! At this tragic juncture , we must regroup , we must be firmly realistic . Do n't you agree , Khoklov ? We should go to the one locale in Europe that guarantees a profit . " <p> " The former Yugoslavia ? " Khoklov said eagerly . " They say you can make a free phone call anywhere in the world from Belgrade . Using a currency that does n't even exist any more ! " <p> " Obvious potential there , " said Raf . " Of course , it requires operators who can land on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their profession . " <p> " Bosnia-Herzegovina , " Khoklov breathed , turning his reddened face to yet another tirelessly rising sun . " The new frontier ! What do you think , Starlitz ? " <p> " I think I 'll just hang out a while , " Starlitz said . He gripped his nose with thumb and forefinger . Suddenly , without another word , Starlitz tumbled backward from the boat into the dark Baltic water . In a few short moments he was lost from sight . <p> CARTOON : " Stephen King understands women !
