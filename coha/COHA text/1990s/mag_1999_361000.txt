Pioneering aircraft design did not end with the brothers Wright . Some of today 's most innovative work is being done by designers in their own high-tech skunk works . <P> BURT RUTAN Airplane kits with nose-mounted wings and no tail that seem to fly backward . Jets with oversize canards mounted , Wright-brothers style , forward of the wings . A spindly , twin-boomed plane that in 1986 was the first to fly around the world without refueling . Aircraft designed by Burt Rutan do n't look like other planes . One of the industry 's most innovative and influential designers , Rutan has built a pressurized gondola for a round-the-world balloon attempt , a rigid winglike sail for an America 's Cup winner , GM 's Ultralight show car and the X-38 NASA crew-return vehicle . He is now testing his most exotic craft yet , the asymmetrical twin-engined Boomerang , designed to prevent instability should one engine fail . And he has set his sights on the $10 million X-PRIZE for the first private spaceship to carry three passengers to sub-orbital altitude , land safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAUL MACCREADY In 1977 one of MacCready 's creations , the Gossamer Condor , a kitelike affair powered only by a furiously pedaling cyclist-pilot , flew more than 7 min . Two years later , the Gossamer Albatross , an improved model , was pedaled across the English Channel . In 1981 a pilot took the sun-powered Solar Challenger 163 miles from France to a base in England . No wonder the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1980 named MacCready its Engineer of the Century . In the years since , MacCready has fashioned such marvels as the wing-flapping pterodactyl that flew in the IMAX film On the Wing , the General Motors " Impact " electric car and the unmanned solar-powered Pathfinder , which has already flown to 80,000 ft.  --  higher than any other propeller-driven aircraft . <P>  --  By Leon Jaroff
