In the catalog of astonishments that will forever mark the chronicles of the gulf war , none is more dramatic than the remarkable professionalism of the U.S. soldiers who planned and fought the battles . That was exemplified most visibly by the smooth TV performances of top military officers in Washington and Saudi Arabia . Intelligent , frank , sometimes eloquent , these men seemed to personify a new class of American military leaders who not only have a &lt; thorough grasp of their trade but also demonstrate broad political and worldly sophistication  --  not to mention p.r . savvy . <P> It was not always thus . During the Vietnam era , many Americans came to regard the U.S. officer class as a band of dissemblers and incompetents . As for the grunts , their ranks had long been considered a repository for society 's dropouts . From the Revolutionary War to the early 1900s , it was not only common but legal for a conscript to pay someone else to take his place in the armed forces . Some criminal court judges even sentenced miscreants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a top-to-bottom transformation since the end of Vietnam . Nowadays , says U.S. Air Force Academy spokesman Colonel Mike Wallace , " the military is a different breed of cat . It is no longer a place to hide society 's misfits ; it represents a large section of America 's middle class , who are better informed and better trained than before . " Today every man and woman entering the armed forces has at least a high school diploma , and nearly all officers have earned at least a bachelor 's degree in subjects ranging from political science to European history . Lieut . General Thomas Kelly , who skillfully led the Pentagon 's Washington briefings on Operation Desert Storm , has a B.S. in journalism ; Marine Brigadier General Richard Neal , the main briefer in Saudi Arabia , has a master 's degree in education . Allied Commander H. Norman Schwarzkopf has an M.S. in mechanical engineering . General Colin Powell , who never attended a military academy , has earned a B.S. in geology and a master 's degree in business administration . <P> For senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college days . Some attend a two-week national-security program at Harvard 's John F. Kennedy School of Government that is held every year , as well as numerous seminars on a variety of political and military issues . In addition , the Council on Foreign Relations provides an internship program for military officers . The Pentagon even runs a " charm school " ( properly called the General Officer Orientation class ) , where freshly baked brigadiers are taught social graces that include the proper choice of forks as well as the finger-bowl ritual . <P> The new emphasis on the culturization of the officer corps came with a reassessment that followed the Vietnam War and the subsequent changeover to an all-volunteer military . One distressing result of the Vietnam experience was that large numbers of disillusioned officers resigned from the services . The Pentagon needed not only a new infusion of talent but also a major overhaul in organization and training . Most important , the traditional interservice bickering that often hobbled performance in the field and sowed distrust between officers and men had to end .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
