When Erica took a leave of absence to complete her research she knew almost immediately that she would fail . She devised lists of people to telephone , penciled in a schedule of interviews and columns with questions . Her handwriting seemed small and bruised . She called no one . <p> She remembers now , in the long mornings when Flora and Bob are gone , that she always detested fragments . Or more accurately , the need to order them , to invent a spine , a progression , a curve that resolves . <p> She is , at her core , too nervous , restless and cynical . There is something within her that can only say no . It 's odd that she had thought she had subdued this , found her own rainforest , slashed and burned it to the last acre of cold ash . She wonders if she should be grateful . Perhaps somewhere on a balcony , in a permanently ochre-tinted city she is n't certain of , there is more air for someone , a woman standing mute and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . <p> It was late morning . Day was elbowing clouds above glazed roofs of orange tiles , and she felt startled and amazed . Seen from the right angle , the city was a sequence of seashells , glistening abalone , mother-of-pearl . She became aware of the fact that she was n't worried about abandoning he project or the implications this might have on her tenure profile . She had always sensed a rainy day coming . It would be an afternoon in winter when some massive typhoon would speak her name . There would be a new fluid language , a kind of cursive rendered in acid . Then it would invade her lungs , she would be singed , and it would be the time of the drowning . <p> It occurred to her that the suddenness with which her behavior altered had a predestined quality . It was as if all her life she had been secretly engaged in a dress rehearsal for precisely this abandonment and divestiture . This knowledge felt perpetual and alluring , like sin or revelation . It was inescapable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was the cove where she was meant to anchor . <p> This must be what she was thinking about at traffic lights , why she did n't play her car radio and was never bored , why the static in the air seemed a kind of hieroglyphic she tried to decipher . This must be why she would walk out of theaters and not remember the title of the play , the setting or even the genre . Had it been a musical , a love story or a comedy ? She would walk across a parking lot , shaking her head . <p> Perhaps she had been tuned into another station entirely . There was something on the margin that attracted her , something in the extreme edge of the register where you could n't be certain of dates or motives or outcome . She could never understand , really , why the motion picture was more interesting than sitting in the lobby with the carpet that looked like a stained glass in reverse , deco blood petals , panels of crimson and lime that marked not translucency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glared at each other above the too yellow popcorn and all things were random , vaguely metallic and swollen . She thought of hooks that wee swallowed . And why was this less significant than the other images , the ones you sat in the dark rooms for , sat as if a subliminal force were fattening you for a harvest or a kill . <p> Erica realized that time would pass and her grant would expire . The questions she had planned to examine seemed distant and trivial . She wondered if it were possible to be defined by refusal . Certainly the most brilliant of her subjects would listen to her questions , run a slow hand across a soft mouth and remain silent . She was looking out the kitchen window when she realized this . There were five pigeons on a strip of grass and the red bands around their necks were exactly the same shade of corrupted pink as the red no-stopping lines painted on the curb in front of their house . Had she finally discovered something ? <p> She began to sleep past eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night before , gave Flora ten dollars , told her to wait outside and keep the change . She reminded Flora not to mention this to Bob . She squeezed Flora 's shoulder with her fingers when she said this . <p> When Erica woke up late , she made a second pot of coffee , put brandy in it , ate an extra piece of toast , layered it with jam . She turned on the stereo . The concept of rock and roll in the morning by sunlight was stunning . <p> Her husband came home for lunch . She had n't expected him . She was looking out the kitchen window . There was a tarnish in the air , a sort of glaze . Perhaps part of a complicated cleaning solution with invisible ammonia , it was designed to bring out the shine . But the sky was overcast . <p> " You seem troubled , " Bob said . He put his briefcase on the table . Its proportion seemed monumental . " Is it the research ? " <p> She shook her head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour the working men sat on lawns smoking cigarettes and eating lunches that looked too meager to sustain them . They leaned close to one another , planning burglaries and trading lies about women . <p> " You are n't yourself , " Bob decided . He paused and studied her face . " I do n't have to go to Seattle . Christ . I do n't even have a paper to deliver . " <p> Erica said , " Do n't be silly . I 'm perfectly fine . " <p> Later , she stood in the backyard where the bushes were trimmed and resembled elongated skulls . She had forgotten he was going to a conference . Now that she knew he would be gone this night and the next , she wondered if his absence mattered . Was it fundamental , was it definitive , would there be change ? She leaned against the side of the house . These were the stark fragments that bruised , made you fall , made you hoarse . It was best to create methods of walking with your eyes shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his conclusion was wrong . He could observe but not interpret . She was merely in transition . She was returning to a version of a former self . And Erica wondered how she would devise a process of clarification , how she would solve this small confusion of who she was . <p> Whenever she encountered enormities , Erica could only think of walking beside water , a bay or a rocky stretch of coast , or finding her daughter , holding Flora and breathing in the scent of her black hair , which was the spiced essence of night rivers . They were the only two manifestations in the landscape that were indisputable , like a certain sequence of spires , of bridges or plazas . This was how she could know where she was . Geography would form a rudimentary net , the first in a series of coordinates . Later , she could build a landing strip . <p> Erica walks into the early afternoon , uncertain of where she is going . There is only a sense of fluid depth and the realization that she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has two best friends , and both of them are dying . These two other women , barely nodding acquaintances , have somehow achieved a massive presence in Erica 's life . Often her sister will telephone with frantic updates on the brutal unravelings of the other women . It is curious how Lillian and Babette seem more vivid to her than her actual friends . <p> Erica is given the details of their deterioration , and she absorbs these fragments without effort . They arrange themselves , as if she has an innate capacity for this ordering . She understands these proportions , their facets , how they must be viewed and composed . She envisions Babette , the French skier , frail now , ninety-three pounds . Babette , who never married or had children , who chose instead an intimacy with mountains , a life of suitcases and hotels facing ridges of white , is now confined to a wheelchair . <p> Erica has memorized the saga of Lillian , shunned by her oncologist , left without a referral for three months , and finally sent to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treatment to fail . <p> In the long mornings of waxy stray sunlight across camellias , she finds herself waiting for Ellen to telephone , to recite the most recent conversations , to impart the medical data and the second and third opinions . How Lillian , only a year before the vice president of a stockbrokerage , a woman with two hundred and seventy-five employees , called in the pre-dawn , terrified . They had removed the plug from her arm . They wanted her to get out of bed and into a wheelchair . <p> " They 're dismissing me , and I 'm too sick to go home , " Lillian realized and wept . " I 'm afraid . I keep drifting off . " <p> " What did you do ? " Erica asks . She can see part of the street from her living room window . The leaves on the orange trees look artificial , landscaped beyond recognition . They are not trees but someone 's concept of how trees should look . <p> " I tracked down the resident . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month left . " Her sister sounds broken . " I told him Lillian lives alone . I said he could n't send her home alone , not like this . " <p> She pictures Lillian , whom she has only met twice , and can not clearly remember , as a tall woman with white hair and a straw hat with yellow silk flowers . Now this Lillian is shrunken , ordered into a wheelchair and pushed to the front of a building she can not recognize . She has no hair , she is too weak to fasten her wig , it 's become too complicated . A nurse who barely speaks English , is from the Philippines of Guatemala , deposits the wheelchair at a curb where a taxi attempts to take Lillian to an apartment she can not provide adequate directions to . <p> After all , north or south of Wilshire is an immensity of possibility ; everything writhes , stung by citrus and pastel . Who could draw the line ? Lillian knows there are indications Poinsettias in a cluster might be December . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course vegetation is a kind of compass that rises from the ground . There is always a chorus of pigments . This is why we believe in resurrection . And Lillian could n't get out of a taxi , walk across a lobby , wait for an elevator , open the many locks of the heavy front door she had insisted on . And there 's no food there , there has n't been food in weeks . She just eats through a plug . She ca n't remember how to turn on appliances or to whom she gave her cat . <p> Erica wonders if these are parables . Is this what happens to women who dare to live alone , even the good ones , like Lillian , a churchgoer who does n't sin , ever . Her sister is adamant . Lillian is from the South , for god 's sake , she wears gloves and gives money to an organization to protect stray animals . <p> The air smells scrubbed , polished and detoxed . It is a winter that has been taught a lesson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this , in some remote time , when she ca n't be there to protect her , to make sure about release forms , wheelchairs , plugs , the administration of morphine , a bed with a view of the tops of palms . <p> Suddenly Erica remembers when she decided to murder her daughter . They were living in Northern California . It was the winter it never stopped raining , the coldest and wettest on record . She was going to graduate school , and they did n't know anyone in the county . Erica was still smoking three packs of cigarettes a day . She had bronchitis again . It was her fourth bout of bronchitis that year , and she refused to take a chest X ray . The doctor in the student clinic said she was killing herself , pointed his long white arm at the door , placed her chart on the counter next to he purse , turned back , walked away . <p> Erica was convinced she had lung cancer . She could sense the blue panicles like a glacial stream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were sensitive to water . Inside her veins she could feel a fluid she imagined was the color of chilled larkspur . She was certain she would n't survive this California winter . <p> It was before she married Bob . She lay awake listening to the rain and imagined her daughter Flora without her , a four-year-old orphan , a ward of the state . A child to be adopted by foster parents who would sexually abuse her , fail to provide piano lessons and poetry . A child to be raised in apartments where she was the entertainment for the brothers and uncles and the television set was always on . <p> There was only one possible solution . She would take Flora into her bed , curve into her body , hold her beneath the quilt . They would both take sleeping pills and the winter would be over . But she did n't kill Flora that night , did n't kill herself , and now it is Los Angeles in early February . <p> Everything feels and tastes like spring . The afternoon dissolves into impressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them language , she thinks . We practice acts of anthropomorphism ; we weld the rules of grammar , but they are still creatures , pulsing . <p> She needs to see Flora . She is nine blocks from her school . It is afternoon and at 2:30 the fourth graders have gym on North Field . Erica can sit behind a clump of oleander and watch her daughter play volleyball near the fence . The day has become simple , transparent . She can either walk along the ocean or watch Flora move through lacquered sunlight . These are the only two indisputable activities in this world . <p> She walks past an orange tree , then a tree with lemons that look distended and one with tangerines that are a sharp red . They sting the mouth . You bite into them and burn of bleed . You serve such fruit at weddings or wakes . Yesterday she watched Bob pack . He was going to a meeting in Washington . He said she seemed different . " I 'm fine . I 'm perfectly fine , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother . She had employed exactly the same cadence , the precise rise and fall of her voice . This is a lie she has long ago engraved within herself . This is the way she imagines grown-ups speak . And her mother said , " Do n't make me laugh . " <p> " I 'm getting myself together , " she had told her mother . It might have been at the end of graduate school , during her first divorce . It might have been the winter she almost murdered her daughter . <p> " It 's going to take you a lifetime , " her mother said . Her mother was drinking vodka . She surveyed her coolly , evaluated he like a suit she did n't consider worth buying . Then she smiled . <p> Of course , her mother and father are dead now . They are dead but not quite gone . There is an entire substratum of people like this , people she does n't quite know , and yet they somehow linger . There is the matter of he sister with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her daughter 's mystery friends that surface and are erased , names she has never heard before suddenly brandished as best friends . <p> " You know Alexa ? " Flora begins . Erica says no . " Alexa , my best friend , " Flora continues , highlighting each of her words , obviously annoyed . <p> This name is not familiar . She feels defensive and afraid . " I know Robin and Claudia , " she reminds her daughter . " I know the twins . But not Alexa . " <p> She is combing Flora 's hair . It is night . She winds strands into tiny black braids . In the morning , when the braids are undone , Flora will be adorned with vast complexities of curl . Now Flora 's head looks like a nest of snakes . We give birth to mythology over and over , Erica realizes , almost trembling with terror . We are the dried riverbeds where they hatch , where they drag their cold bodies across sand . It is from our bellies that they come . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do is talk on the phone . You do n't even drive me to school anymore . " Then she slams her bedroom door . <p> Now it is important that she find Flora and tell her she was n't lying . There are protocols for the keeping of names . These syllables are sacred . When the winds have taken everything , even the buildings and the stones and the bark , these names will remain . These are the perpetually open graves . She is going to explain this to her daughter . She will defend herself against this suggestion of desecration . <p> Last night , her sister called with more information about Babette . She can no longer sit . She has to sleep strapped to a board , uptight , held by buckles . Her bones are turning to a kind of tin . Her sister can not pronounce the name of the new disease . She can only say that Babette is rusting . She has nightmares filled with liquids , rain : waterfalls , a recurrent beach where she watches the approach of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She says Babette 's skin smells like dust . She creaks when she breathes . <p> Erica knows both women were misdiagnosed , twice . Somewhere there are four mistakes ; someone must be counting . Last night she asked her sister , " Do you ever talk to Lillian about death ? About dying ? " Erica was lying on her bed . She wanted to know . Bob had not yet gone to Seattle . Erica had shut her bedroom door . <p> Her sister thought for a moment . " No . " <p> " What do you talk about ? " Erica asks . <p> " Ordinary things , " her sister told her . " Who 's playing good tennis . Who got a face lift . Whose kid is in jail . The weather , the economy , you know . " <p> Erica does know . When her father was dying , when he was decaying in front of them , inches from their faces and almost in slow motion , it was the one thing no one ever spoke about . Father had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow that made her think of tortured fruit and strange rotting cargoes abandoned at sea and something terrible done in rooms with unshaded lightbulbs , abortions , perhaps , or children being photographed naked . Her father 's skin became translucent . He was a region of rivers . You could peer inside and see his infinity of blue sins . <p> Erica wants to ask her sister if she remembers this , but she does n't . They never speak about their parents or the way they died of what their lives might have meant . Their parents simply disappeared , like a species that vanished overnight . It 's as if they never were . <p> Erica realizes there is an entire ghost substratum inhabiting her . She 's become aware of how much time she spends thinking about people she does n't know and will never know , does n't even want to meet once . Not just Lillian and Babette , these secondary tragedies she 's internalized , not just Flora 's profusion of suddenly found and lost best fiends , but how she thinks about movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She does n't do this consciously , she would never permit herself to do this consciously . But when she takes her emotional pulse , when she looks directly inside , what she 's been thinking about during a three-way traffic light , during a wait in a line at the bank , is Elizabeth Taylor and her new husband , the former carpenter and drug dealer . What do they do together ? Do they attend AA meetings ? Do they work the twelve-step recovery program ? Do they promptly admit mistakes and answer crisis hotlines ? She thinks they secretly drink and take drugs . Liz shows him what she has learned about pain pills and champagne . And he initiates her . into the sordid avenues of hard-faceted white , the great internal winter , cocaine . <p> Now , during her leave of absence , when she can take her emotional pulse repeatedly , with concentrated deliberation , she realizes she has been colonized by the insubstantial  --  something leaking , broken and generic out of a self-destructing culture . A kind of collective virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylvia Plath . That was when she lived with painters , when she lived in lofts above Indian restaurants , and afternoons smelled of curry , the sun set in a sequence of saffrons , she thought the bungalows behind hedges of sunflowers along the Venice canals were holy , and her parents were not yet dead . <p> She did n't try to imagine Sylvia Plath and her husband in bed . She did n't envision Virginia wrapped in the arms of a woman , rain falling , and what they might have done with their mouths . She visualized instead the kitchens where they brewed tea , the patterns of painted pink rosebuds on the cups and the way the wind sounded as if it had just been eating ships . But the graphic couplings she now considers , the intricacies of bodies and proclivities , this she has saved for television stars . <p> It is 1:30 , and she is four blocks from Flora 's school . She can sense that Lillian is going into a coma . That 's what she was afraid of when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send me home . I feel like I 'm drifting in and out . " <p> Erica closes her eyes , and there are acres of faces within her . She is even replete with the spouses of men she barely knows . How many afternoons had she imagined her lawyer 's wife . She did this for months during her first divorce , staring at the photograph on his desk . A blond woman with ice skates hung over her right shoulder . A woman wearing a green wool sweater and sunglasses . She was often tempted to ask her name . She finally decided it was Ingrid or Justine . She was good with dogs and gardens , never got migraines , enjoyed baking . <p> It occurs to Erica that what she wants to research is not history as it actually is or was but some more fragile peripheral version , in its own way , filled with untamed ambiguity . It would be a history of the undead , the flickering partials and the almost . <p> In these regions of ambivalence are the men she almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conversation , a newspaper clipping , an accidental sighting , something overheard . She might have stayed with Derek in Maui . Or the photographer in Spain . There are the lingering pulsings of her former selves , standing on balconies of apartments and villas , watering geraniums , wearing a white slip above cobblestone alleys , above a plaza or a bay . <p> Jason , telephoning her at the university two years ago . She was working late . He was drunk . " I 'm drinking fifteen-year-old scotch and it 's been fifteen years since I fucked you . Come over . " <p> Erica looked out her office window , noted the low soiled mountains and considered it . It was August in Southern California , and everything seemed burned , even at night . It was the time of the avenues of scorch and the unraveling of an indelible yellow . <p> She could reach into the substrata of the barely known , make a date , meet in a motel in Long Beach , maybe , or Van Nuys . It would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it would n't be about beaches and palm trees , but California as it really was- back roads the color of mustard , smelling of onions and vinegar below hills where nothing could grow . In a valley of brush and sage and sand they could know the real nature of their hearts . It was n't the stuff of postcards . But they knew this already . That 's why she hung up . <p> We carry the undead with us , she thinks . That 's why it 's so hard to walk , why her boots hurt and the sun sears . She still packs for Jason , still takes him to Hawaii and London with her . She stands at her closet , one closet of another , hearing him say , only red or black . You 're a Toulouse-Lautrec whore . Anything else on you skin is an atrocity . And she finds herself repeatedly choosing these colors , in nightgowns and coats , tablecloths and socks . <p> Maybe she will tell her colleagues it is the history of the partial she wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is what she is thinking as she approaches Flora 's school , as she sits on a lawn next to a rock with a bronze plaque nailed to it . " Dedicated to Maurice J. Finelander , 1918-1964 . " What did that forty-six-year-old man die from ? Did he suffer , turn translucent , did he drift , could you look inside his chest and chart the avenues of his disgrace ? <p> After she sees Flora , she will go home and wait for her sister to call . Afternoons are punctuated with desperate news about Lillian . Sometimes Erica telephones first . She has never called her sister so often , not even when their mother had a heart attack . They have n't spoken this often since they shared a room in the summer house . <p> " What 's the latest with Lillian ? " she will ask . Her eyes will be abnormally wide , she will take big breaths , as if there is some quality in the late afternoon wind that she needs . <p> Perhaps it has something to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots , shadows and branching networks . This is beneath her feet all the time . This is what children sense under the bed . This is the secret structure of the world , and children feel this hidden spine . This is why they need stuffed pandas and teddy bears . This is why she is walking to the school to find her daughter , to tell Flora she would never lie about the names of the almost known . <p> Suddenly , Erica recognizes a complexity that makes her decide to turn back . She wants to tell Flora that certain fragments seem like lies but they are not . It is simply the other world with its decaying possibilities casting luminous debris . It is not deliberate . There is no malice . But names get lost here . They are like seashells washed up on a wide night shore in a season of not enough moon . Inside each shell is a name , and the sea speaks it clearly , says Alexa , Flora , Lillian . But there ate winds , the intrusion of partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue . And Erica realizes that she can not tell this to Flora . This is a stretch of beach you must find for yourself and then only in a drowning season . <p> Erica walks home on a boulevard where the sidewalk is planted with rose bushes , bird of paradise and iris , and she is thinking about events in the subterranean world . Here are the traffic accidents we almost had , but did n't . Here are the planes we missed that might have carried bombs on them . Do the almosts form an architecture ? Is that how you navigate in the cities of the undead ? <p> Later that week , her sister calls , desperate . Lillian has run away . She 's had a paranoid seizure , perhaps from the drugs . Or maybe the cancer has metastasized into her brain . No one knows . She just took her raincoat and wallet and disappeared from the hospital . Her neighbor saw her get out of a cab . Lillian explained that she had come back for her cat . <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She imagines her sister holding the phone , pacing , staring out the balcony . The wind has been blowing , a Santa Ana from the desert . Everything seems a form of fleshy yellow . It is a night of skin . Lamps are insignificant . The moon is so inordinately bright she thinks the savanna must have been like this , rocked by streaks of yellow with the intensity of seduction and prophecy . <p> " We 'll drive the streets and find her , " Erica decides . " I 'll pick you up . " <p> Flora has suddenly appeared . She is always barefoot , soundless . She simply materializes . She is holding her math book open at her hip . Flora could survive in the night , with her head of uncoiling snakes . She seems to be waiting for something . Erica knows what her daughter is doing . Flora is stalking . <p> Bob has returned from his conference in Seattle . He is staring at her , watching her assemble car keys , wallet , jacket . He studies the objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to collect evidence . He is standing in front of the living room door as if he intends to guard it . <p> Earlier , when she was cooking dinner , Bob had asked if she had gone to the library . He had telephoned , and she was n't home . She said no . She stared at the cheese she was cutting . She examined the tip of the knife . Her husband did n't understand that she was never going back to the library . It does n't contain the artifacts she needs . Then he asked what she had done all day . <p> " I do n't remember , " she said . She was holding a knife . It felt hard in her hand . She put it down . She could feel the moon through the window . It occurred to her that there was no history , only the etiology of yellow . <p> Now Bob says , " Where are you going ? " <p> There is always this moment , she realizes . The where and the why . The demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who saw the troops , which direction and how many . There is always this and the way sometimes you do n't answer . " It 's Lillian , " she says , walking quickly toward the door . He is heavier but has trouble with his knees . She could outflank him if she had to . " She 's roaming the streets . She 's lost her mind . " <p> Erica considers the invisible artifacts she has recently unearthed . She thinks about mapping the subterranean stratum . What sort of tools would she need , what form of illumination ? <p> " But you do n't even know that woman , " her husband says . <p> " I do know her , " Erica replies . " I 've never known anyone so well . " <p> Flora is staring at her . They look into one another 's eyes , and Erica realizes communication is dimensional , like something knitted , a tope or a net . Then she is walking into the yellowed night , where the wind sounds like a rushing river ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are clinging to stay on . <p>
