 | " I need to question all the humans here , " I said to the Lazarian . " If one of them killed Ms. Entwater , that person must be punished according to our law . " " Trrrried and punished if found guilty , " the Lazarian corrected . " Ques-tion . " Farber moved to my side , swallowing . " Thinta-ah requests permission to inquire something of you , " he said to me , sounding ceremonial . I repressed the urge to sigh heavily ; I 'm no diplomat , and the six years I 'd spent on the gang squad had made me tired of ritual . Maybe it should have prepared me for the more Byzantine protocols of extraterrestrials , but I 've got a bad attitude . Twenty years ago , when the Lazarians had first arrived , maybe I 'd have been much more excited , but then , I 've always had low blood pressure anyway . " Ask your question , " I said . " Say please , ' Farber whispered . I smiled as broadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put its six-digit hands on top of its sack-like head . " If Entwa-ahter is dead by one of us , wha-aht then ? " I glanced at Entwater again . From this distance , it was hard to see the details of the marks on her throat , but they could have been made by one of those Lazarian hands . One would have been enough  --  like the rest of their limbs , those digits were long and multi-jointed , and could have gone all the way around a human neck easily . " This is your embassy , " I said , " which means to us , it is a piece of your nation . We would trust you to serve your own justice in this matter . " Stilton was looking at me like I was crazy . I did n't blame him . All of a sudden , I was talking like a hollie version of a diplomat . I could n't help it ; something about the Lazarians was making me go into awkward-formal mode . The Lazarian put a hand on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Truth ma-ah-chine . " I gave Farber a sidelong glance . " What now ? " Farber swallowed twice . " It would seem that Thinta-ah wants you to use the ' viewer on them . " He gestured at the Lazarians standing around Entwater . Stilton coughed . " I do n't think it 'll work . We 're  --  ah ? " he turned to the Lazarian " ? we 're too different . " I could tell he was trying to imagine how those sackheads would register . The ' viewer worked on interpreting a lot of little things  --  facial expression , blood flow , temperature , eye and muscle movements , pulse , respiration , vocal quality and inflection , choice of words , context , and some other things I did n't have to bother remembering . It was n't infallible , we 'd all been told , but in my experience , I have yet to  | see anyone beat it , not even the most hardened pathological liars . We were only allowed to use it to determine probable cause for search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so it was n't any more admissible in court than the old lie detector results had been , but it was useful enough . " Can converrrt , " said the Lazarian . " Ha-ahve progra-ahms to converrrt for our species . " Stilton held the ' viewer protectively close to his chest , giving me a desperate look . " I do n't know , " I said . " I 'd have to call ? " Farber swallowed . " Were n't you told to take every measure necessary to wrap this up as quickly as possible ? " He leaned closer and lowered his voice . " Do you want to think about the repercussions of having an unsolved murder in the Lazarian embassy ? They ' 11 have to call out the National Guard to protect this place , and all of us will still be trapped inside of it . And that includes you and your partner . The door is booby- trapped . Something sonic . Break the plane from this side and you 'll drop like a rock . When you wake up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He jerked his head at the group of humans . " Some of them tried it . Ask them if they 'll try it again . Get it through your head , no one is going to leave here until this is settled , and if it takes months , that 's not Thinta-ah 's problem . " " All right , " I said . All right for now . Call in a siege team ? I 'd never get that okayed . I 'd have to see about locating the control for the doorway knock-out and figure out how to disable it later . That would probably cause an international incident  --  interstellar incident ? ? but not as major an incident as a siege team storming the place . I looked at the Lazarian , but that face was unreadable . As usual . It was actually the outer surface of a kind of flexible exoskeleton that covered the whole head , featureless except for irregular , opaque black patches where the eyes and mouth would be . I 'd read somewhere that the exoskeleton thickened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual to each Lazarian , but no one knew what caused it or what it meant to the Lazarians , except that they referred to what lay beneath it as the true face , ' which was never to be shown to another living being , not even if its owner were dead . Which I thought begged the question : what was the point of having a socalled true face ' if nobody could ever see it ? Something teased at the edge of my mind . I looked over at the Lazarians still motionless around the corpse . Was the penalty for seeing a true face ' immediate death ? Everyone was staring at me expectantly . " I should still probably call in for authorization , " I said weakly . " Ca-ahll , " said the Lazarian , and it was n't granting me permission , but giving me an order .  | I took the cellular off my belt and punched the speed-dial for the direct line to the captain . The subsequent conversation was almost as brief . " She says it 's a go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my belt . Stilton looked outraged for half a second and then wiped all expression from his face . For some reason , ' viewer operators get extremely possessive about their baby . Normally , Stilton would n't even let me hold his . " Let 's get the program and convert the ' viewer for Lazarians . " Farber looked distressed as he swallowed . " Well , I 've just thought of a problem . " I winced . " Only one . What a relief . " " It 's big one . The program is in Ms. Entwater 's office upstairs . Everyone who was in the embassy at the time of Ms. Entwater ' s death is now here in this room , Lazarians and humans alike . We may not leave this room , not any of us . " " Why not ? " I said , looking at Thinta-ah . " Bee-cauzzzzeh , " the Lazarian replied , still using the command voice . " Oh , " I said , hoping I did n't sound sarcastic and looked at Farber . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We could call a courier to fetch the program for us . Of course , the courier will have to stay here with us afterwards . " " We 'll charge the overtime to the embassy , " I said , reaching for my cellular again . The courier business took a little longer , since the courier made the mistake of entering the room we were all in first , forcing me to have to call out for another . Forewarned , the second courier put the program chips in an envelope and tossed it to me through the open doorway . " Go to it , " I said , handing the envelope to Stilton . His face had a slightly greenish cast to it . " Before I fool with the ' viewer and quite possibly break it , maybe we should talk to the humans , " he said . " Our species firrrrrrst , " said Thinta-ah , and it was another command . I wanted to object . Across the room , the half dozen human employees were also still huddled together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gotten tired of sitting and was now leaning against the wall behind the others , smoking a cigarette in a long holder . She looked happy , but all Pilots look happy all the time . It 's something that happens to them as a result of their training . Maybe after that first trip , they never really came back , ' so to speak . " Do as you 're told , " Farber said to Stilton , managing to sound apologetic . " I 've got a wife , a husband , and three children I 'd like to see again before I 'm much older , and I imagine you both have families as well . "  | I cleared my throat . In Salon 's case , that had been the wrung , appeal to make ; his significant others had voted him out three weeks before and he was still stinging from it . But instead of giving Farber the evil eye , he went to work on the ' viewer , even allowing me to steady it for him while he changed chips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything synchronized and in phase and whatever else  --  I 'm no more of a techie than I am a diplomat , though I suspected the last fifteen minutes he spent on running tests and diagnostics was nothing but pure stalling . " I guess it 's ready , " he said at last . " But even with all these adjustments and conversions for Lazarian biology , I do n't know how well it 's going to work with an exoskeleton . " " No ex-oh , " said Thinta-ah , coming over to stand too close again . " True faaaa-aice . " The Lazarians gathered around Entwater made no perceptible physical movements , but something in the air changed . Everybody felt it , even the humans on the other side of the room . It was similar to the sudden presence of ozone before a lightning strike ( do n't ask me how I know about that unless you 're ready for a story longer than this one ) , and for a moment , I thought I could actually feel my hair stand on end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , " I said to Thinta-ah . " How ? " Thinta-ah made Stilton cringe by touching the ' viewer again . " Not a-ahlive . " " You 'll allow a recording that we can look at ? " Stilton said , amazed . " A-ahllow to look a-aht recording one time , " the Lazarian said , making a strange movement something like a full body shrug . The clothing , as loose , mismatched , and wrinkled as anything that ever came out of a Good Will free bin , seemed to readjust itself on the Lazarian 's loose-jointed body , somehow acquiring even more wrinkles . Wrinkles especially seemed to be their fashion statement . The Lazarians around the corpse still did n't move , but I knew they were unhappy . Not just unhappy , but unhappier than they had ever been in their lives . I tried to imagine an equivalent for myself ? being forced to strip naked in public seemed obvious , but I knew this was a lot more than a nudity taboo . My gaze fell on the ' viewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ? " One time , " I said to Stilton . " We 'd better make it a good look , then . " Thinta-ah did some fast organizing . The humans were to sit directly behind to the group in the center of the room so they could n't possibly see their true faces while they were speaking to the ' viewer . Very simple solution just the sort of thing that signals some major complication is  | imminent . Stilton and I found a chair for the ' viewer . He got it aimed at the first Lazarian , fiddled with the focus for a few seconds , and then turned it on . " Any time , " he told the Lazarian and turned away , crowding close to me as Thinta-ah crowded close to him . In the long pause that followed , I could hear the Lazarian removing the exoskeleton . It was a ghastly sound , like cloth ripping and I wondered if it hurt . Anything that made a noise like that seemed like it had to hurt . " You a-ahsk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is your name ? " " Simeer-ah , " said the Lazarian . I felt Thinta-ah stiffen . The last syllable indicated this was some relative of Thinta- ah ' s , but not which kind . " How are you connected to ? " " A-ahsk only about Entwa-ahter ! " Thinta-ah practically shouted . I hesitated , wanting to explain about establishing a pattern and knowing at the same time that Thinta-ah was n't buying . A Lazarian 's true face was exposed in the presence , if not the sight , of others , and to them , this was much more urgent than a murder . Any murder . I could have sworn I heard Farber swallow from across the room . " Do as you 're told , " he called from where he stood facing the now closed door with the courier . Behind me , the exposed Lazarian made a small noise . I 'd never heard the sound before but I knew instinctively that the alien was weeping . A wave of compassion mixed with shame swept through me  --  not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation . If I 'd felt sorry for everyone who ever cried during questioning , there 'd have been a few more hardheads running free who had gotten away with murder and worse . I took a deep breath . " What do you know about the death of Celie Entwater ? " " I a-ahm responsible . " My shamed compassion turned to cold water . " Are you saying you killed her ? " " It is my fault . " " Are you saying you killed her ? " I asked again . Stilton shrugged . " First time 's a charm , I guess , " he whispered . " You strangled Celie Entwater ? " I persisted . " I ha-ahve the blaaaaaa-aimmeh . " " Stop now , " said Thinta-ah , softly . " Next . " I gave up . " All right . We 'll wait while you cover yourself . " Damnedest thing  --  the exoskeleton made the same ripping-cloth sound going back on as it had coming off . My nerves felt sandpapered . And I only had to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more times . No , sixteen more times , I discovered after it was safe to turn around again . Stilton aimed the ' viewer at the next Lazarian . The first one looked no worse for the experience  --  outwardly , anyway . There was nothing like sweat or blood , the exoskeleton appeared unchanged . But the Lazarian 's body looked a little more relaxed , the kind of posture you see in people who finally confess to a crime and find they 're more relieved at being able to get it off their chests than they are frightened of being punished . Maybe the first time really had been a charm . Then the second Lazarian said exactly the same thing and the world rearranged itself into the form it always took during a criminal investigation . The world is full of liars , liars who say they did n't do it and liars who say they did , liars who say they 're sorry and liars who say they 're not , liars who swear they 've never done it before , liars who promise they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  literally . By the time the sixth one confessed , Stilton had taken over the questioning and my cynicism felt like a drug reaching toxic levels in my system . The only thing I actually listened to after number seven was that ripping-cloth sound . There was some kind of cosmic irony at work here , I thought ; expose your true face and then tell a lie . Gave a deeper meaning to the term barefaced liar , that was for sure . What I was n't sure about was why it was affecting me so intensely . Maybe because I secretly suffered from the ailment of poor species selfimage , believing that aliens must be truly superior forms of life to flawridden humanity , and they 'd shattered my illusions of their being closer to the angels . What was that old joke that had made the rounds back when the Lazarians had first arrived ? An optimist thinks humans could be the highest form of life in the universe , a pessimist knows they are . Right . Try this one , I thought bitterly  --  an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are . And the name of the first sibling , in any language anywhere , was Cain . " Still awake ? " Stilton asked me suddenly . I managed not to jump at the sound of his voice . " Yeah . Just . " " Good . Last confession coming up , " he said , fiddling with the ' viewer on the chair . Without my noticing , the lights in the room had come up in response to the waning daylight . Through the frosted windows , I could see that it was nearly dark . With any luck , we might get out by dawn , I thought wearily . And when we did , I was going to ask for a transfer out of homicide and go chase burglars for a while , or drug addicts or people who never paid their parking tickets . " One more time , " Stilton said , assuming the position . The sound of ripping cloth . If this one was going to lie about Entwater , too , then I hoped DIRTY WORK  | it hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group . " Fa-ahr-ber , " the last Lazarian said . " Fa-ahr-ber is at fault . " " What a relief , " I said . " I was afraid sixteen Lazarians had taken turns choking someone to death . But it turns out that the man dressed like a butler did it . Ca n't wait to alert the media . " Thinta-ah suddenly came back to life and told Farber to send out for pizza . Apparently pizza was the closest thing we had to a Lazarian native dish . That did n't cheer me , or even give me an appetite , though I knew I should have been hungry . And thirsty . The humans were  --  they all looked as if they 'd spent the day in a desert , except for the Pilot , who seemed as completely detached and unaffected as ever . And yet , it was the Pilot who informed us that there were new problems developing with the humans . She came over while we were setting up the ' viewer on a side table so we could go over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need , " she said , pointing her cigarette holder at them . " Of what ? " As soon as the words were out of my mouth , I knew the answer , but the Pilot was already telling me . " Of toilets . Some are in real pain , " she added cheerfully . I wanted to hit her . Instead , I talked to Farber . His response made me want to hit him . " Thinta-ah knows , " he said . " Arrangements were made before you got here . " He pointed at a large ornamental flower-pot in the corner . " It only looks like a flower-pot , " he added , as if reading my mind . " It 's a , ah , Lazarian waste receptacle . The Lazarians are , ah ? " swallow " ? casual about this kind of function . " " Oh , really ? " I said . " I sure have n't seen any of them use it . " Swallow . " They only need to every other week . This is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke it to them myself . One of them , a middleaged man , shook his head stubbornly without looking up at me . But a woman of about sixty shrugged , marched over to the receptacle and pointedly turned her back . The anger was almost palpable and I knew what kind of stories they were all going to tell when they were finally allowed to leave . Lazarian human diplomatic relations could well end up being harmed more by the bathroom arrangements than by a murder , I thought , going back to Stilton . Even terrorists would take their hostages to the bathroom . Or , I thought , looking at Thinta-ah who was being careful to look anywhere but toward the corner , had humans just come that much closer to understanding the experience of exposing the true face ? Understanding ? I doubted it . They 'd remember it , but it was n't the sort of thing that would generate much empathy . PAT CAUIAN  | " One look , " Thinta-ah reminded us when we were ready to look at the recordings . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pizza next to him and he was feeling better , much better than the delivery person who had come into the room before we could warn her . She sat sulking with the first courier . I wondered if anyone besides the employees ' families , a courier service , and a pizza parlor had picked up on the fact that there was something funny happening at the Lazarian embassy . My cellular had been strangely silent , no one calling for an update or a statement or anything at all . Maybe we were sitting under a governmental bell jar , families , courier service , pizza parlor , and all . " I 'll need to freeze each image sometimes , " Stilton told Thinta-ah . " Is that all right ? " The answer was so long in coming that I thought Thinta-ah had gone to sleep standing up again . " Yes . A-ahll right . One time through . " Stilton sighed with relief , turned on the ' viewer , and picked up a slice of double shitake mushroom . The screen lit up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd had an appetite , I 'd have had pizza in my own lap . The face on the screen was Enwater 's . Stilton slammed down the freeze button . " What did you do ? " I whispered angrily . " Did you get the focus upside down and put it on her ? " " You can see I did n't , " he said , too spooked to be offended . " That 's not the image of a dead person . That face is animated , it 's moving , talking . Look at the readings . " He pointed at the box on the left side of the screen . " They say living , not dead . " I looked from the screen to Thinta-ah on the other side of the table . " Could this possibly be this Lazarian 's true face ? " " I maaaaaa-aiy not look , " Thinta-ah said . " But wha-aht faaaa-aice you see must be the true one . " I got up and went around the table to the alien . " Listen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ? " " Do not tell me , " said Thinta-ah . " I maaaaaaaay not know . Wha-aht faaaaaaa-aice is there is true . " I tried to think . It was hard with the heavy garlic smell drifting over from the platter next to Stilton . " Okay . The face on that screen can not possibly belong to one of your species , but to another one entirely , and to a certain being ? " " I maaaaaay not know ! " Thinta-ah 's voice echoed in the room , not the command voice this time but a cry of anguish . Everything stopped . Over by the Rockwell-esque mural of the first meeting between human and Lazarian , Farber straightened up from a whispered conversation with the courier and pizza delivery person to glare at me . DIRTY WORK  | " I 'm sorry , " I said to Thinta-ah and bowed . " I was ... I was ignorant . " The Lazarian refused to look at me . I went back around the other side of the table and sat down next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else 's church with a rite from my own . And I did n't even go to church . The association caught in my mind like a burr . Was this religious ? Discounting hobby-killers and for-hires , people tend to take a life over matters having to do with love/sex and personal offenses , real or imagined . Our people ... but the Lazarians ? I beckoned impatiently to Farber , who hurried over . " Can I ask Thintaah about Lazarian psychology ? " Swallow ( of course ) . " No . " I groaned . " Why not ? " " You 're not a psychologist . Besides , they do n't actually have any . " " What are you talking about ? They must . Everybody has psychology . Animals have psychology . " " Well , yes , they have it ? " swallow " ? but they do n't have it as a science or a discipline or whatever you want to call it . The study of psychology is unknown on their world . " " But they must have something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true faces . " " That 's a big mother 's help , " I said . " You want to know what true face that Lazarian on the end over there has ? " He started to protest that he was n't allowed to look and I waved his words away . " Never mind . You would n't believe it if you did see it . " He started to walk away and I caught his arm . " Hey , stay close , will you ? I 'm working without a net here . " " We all are , " he murmured . " The verdict is in , " Stilton said , sitting back . " According to the ' viewer , this alien is telling the truth . " I stared at Entwater 's image on the screen , still frozen . She had been a very attractive woman ; at least one of her parents had had relatives from Japan and whatever else was mixed with it had blessed her with the kind of features that age well . Damned shame they would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ? Did true faces age ? Supposedly , no one knew . Supposedly . But someone must have . There had to be some Lazarian keeper of forbidden knowledge ... did n't there ? I gave up that line of thought as futile . If there were any such Lazarians , they were most likely back on Lazarus , or La-ah- ZA-AHR-eesh , or whatever the hell it was . " What do you want to do ? " Stilton asked me . " You want me to let this PAT CADIC , AN 111 ! 1 V  | picture go and see the next ' ? " " Are you done looking at it ' ? " " Are you ? " He ran a hand through his black curls . " Remember , we 're never going to see it again , so make sure you 've seen your fill . " " I 'm not so sure about that , " I said as he unfroze the image . The corresponding readings in the box were holding , waiting for the video to catch up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed at the ' viewer . " That 's what I mean . " I could actually see Stilton break into a sweat as Entwater 's face reappeared . " Why are you surprised ? " I said . " They all said the same thing . " I looked at Farber . " All except one . " Farber gazed back at me , swallowing without comprehension . Apparently , the last Lazarian ' s voice had n't carried over to him . Or he had n't been paying attention . This time we ran the video concurrent with the lie detector program ; I watched the face while Stilton kept track of the readings . I wanted to imprint that face on my mind . It was n't quite identical to the other one , but the differences were minor  --  the width of the face , the length of the nose , the size of the chin . That figured  --  each Lazarian 's head would be a different size , so the face on it would be sized to fit . The Procrustean face . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappily . " This one 's telling the truth , too . Or so it says here . The program must be defective , though how we 'd ever be able to tell ? " he sighed again . " Keep going , " I said . " Maybe we 'll see a variation somewhere . " Stilton gave me a dirty look . " Yah . " " We 've already seen some . " I leaned close and whispered . " That face is n't completely identical to the first one . There are variations , almost too minor to see , but they are there . What about the readings ? " He called back the first set for comparison . " You 're right . But the variations are all physiological . They have two pulses , and they have respiration and skin temperature and they show the same degrees of variation from one Lazarian to another that we show one human to another . In all standard healthy people , anyway . " " So let 's see if maybe someone is n't standard healthy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than I used to , all of a sudden , " he said and focused his attention on the ' viewer again . But of course , I had just been overly optimistic . Entwater 's face appeared , confessed , disappeared , and reappeared over and over without any telling variations . That was probably telling , except we could n't DIRTY WORK PAT CADIGAN III  | understand what it was telling . At least the seventeenth Lazarian looked like Farber . I took great consolation in the fact that my certainty had been correct . It did n't make up for the fact that the ' viewer said that Lazarian was also telling the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , but you ca n't have everything . " The program 's got to be defective , " Stilton said , replacing Farber 's facsimile with the seventeen readings . " We might as well switch programs , record all the humans , and then get comfortable in our new home . We 're going to be here quite a while and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . " " No , " I said , standing up and looking at Thinta-ah . Farber took a step toward me and Stilton rose to his feet in response , moving to protect my left . " I understand your feelings about the toilet , " he said , " but do n't go losing your head over it now . " " I mean no , the program 's not defective , not no , I wo n't use the toilet . " I went over and stood as close as possible to the Lazarian , who did n't move away . " The program 's incomplete . We do n't have a control . " " A what ? " said Farber suspiciously . " A control , " I said , staring up at Thinta-ah . " A standard to measure the other Lazarians against . " Stilton practically jumped over the table . " Same arrangements as for the other Lazarians , " I said . " Thinta-ah , it 's your turn in the barrel . " " It 's already been Thinta-ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Lazarian lunged past me for the table , but Stilton already had the ' viewer in his arms . " Back off , " he said , moving away , " or I 'll turn this around and show everyone in the room what 's on the screen . " Stretched out across the table , Thinta-ah hesitated and then straightened up slowly . " You maaaaaaaay not see . " " I 've seen , " Stilton said . " You did n't say every Lazarian but you . " " No . I did not . " Thinta-ah backed away from the table but Stilton did n't budge . Instead , he beckoned me over and pulled the ' viewer away from his chest . Thinta-ah had apparently been either the consummate diplomat or completely undecided . His true face was a grotesque mixture of Entwater 's and Farber 's . What made it grotesque was not that it had a patchwork aspect but that it was fluid  --  as if his features had been in the process of melting or flowing from one face to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a control file and the ' viewer informed me that one already existed , " Stilton said as I studied the screen . " So I called it up and ole . " Voila , " I corrected him .  | " In this case , I 'd say it rates an ole . But I should have realized it would be here . It was how Fntwater created the program , by using Thinta-ah as a control . He must have been teacher 's pet . Diplomat 's pet . Whatever . " " Freeze it and let 's hear the audio , " I said . " Unfreeze it when the video and audio are in synch . " A voice that had to be Entwater 's came out of the small speaker . " What is your name ? " " Thinta-ah . " " Are you from another planet ? " " Yesss . " The image on the screen came to life . There were a few more questions . Favorite Earth food ? Pizza with heavy garlic in the sauce  --  true . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all very disjointed but light stuff , like a dating service application , slightly adapted . But it had served the purpose  --  the readings were clear . Stilton let it run out , and then put all the readings on the screen together , the seventeen and Thinta-ah 's . " God-damn-it , " he said and blew out a disgusted breath . " Or maybe we should have known that , too  --  that if there was a control , then the program stands . They 're all telling the truth , or they 're the best liars in the universe . " " You 're right . " We both jumped and Stilton almost dropped the ' viewer . The Pilot had managed to come right up to us without either one of us knowing . " Right about what ? " said Stilton . She pointed a finger at him , smiling . " You seek the truth . And you ? " she swiveled toward me , finger still pointing " ? seek the lie . " " What do you seek ? " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my side . " Resonance , with all that is . Did you hear the one about the Pilot who went up to the hot-dog-o-mat and said , Make me one with everything ? ' " " That joke is so old , it 's got a long grey beard and a brand-new liver , " Stilton said , eyes narrowing . " It 's at least half a century since the first time someone told it , and it was n't a Pilot ? " " It is now . " That was n't a happy expression , I realized  --  it was a serene one . It was the kind of expression you saw on people who were sure they had all the answers , minus the vacancy of the hardcore cult convert . What was Resonance , anyway ? Something about traveling point to point and finding alignment so that two points that seemed to be separated by a great distance actually were n't ... or something . It did n't make any sense to me , but a Pilot was one more thing I was n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sure could n't figure out why it made her so peaceful . " The Lazarians taught us Resonance , " she said , nodding at me . " And to  | travel point to point in space , we must travel point to point in here , too . " She pointed her finger at her own lurehead now . " You do n't have the correct alignments in here , so you can not travel point to point , but point to off-point . Dead end . Wander forty years in the desert and not get out even then . " She made us sit down again while she perched on the edge of the table , placing the ' viewer next to her . " They are all telling the truth , and they are the best liars in the universe that you have ever met , because the truth they tell is their truth . " It was one of the few times in my life that I could say I had experienced satori . And once I saw it , I felt like a total fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't beat the ' viewer because no matter how much they believed in their own lies , they knew what they believed was at variance with facts that other people knew , and so both could n't be true . But the Lazarians were aliens , so of course their concept of the truth would be alien as well . Alien truth . True faces . The two concepts were whirling around each other in my head , trying to find a basis for connection . " So what does that mean ? " Stilton said . " Somehow they all killed her , or they 're all lying to protect someone ? " The Pilot shook her head . " You do n't understand yet . They taught us Resonance with all things . Because they Resonate , always . " I could n't tell if this was another satori or a continuation . " Entwater liked them . She liked her work . " I glanced at Farber . " And she , in turn , was very popular . So popular that ? " I broke off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell me , was she popular because she liked them , or did she like them because she was popular ? " " That has Resonated into one thing now . It can no longer be determined because it is no longer distinguishable . All that remains is ... love . Not the trendy brain chemicals , " she added to Stilton . " Do you Resonate love ? " " You mean , understand it ? " I laughed a little . " Does anyone ? " " What do you do ? For love . What does it do to you ? " For once , I was at a loss because I 'd never had a long term relationship or a child . Alone , you can travel faster in a career , but you leave a lot of understanding in the dust that way , too . " Oh , I guess you care about the other person , " I said finally , feeling like a sappy greeting card . " Yeah . And when they stop loving , they stop caring , " Stilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Pilot 's face lit up even more . I had n't thought it was possible . " Responsible . Responsible . Are you always responsible ? " I a-ahm responsible . It is my fault . I ha-ahve the blaaaaaa-aimmeh . Over and over again , sixteen times , from sixteen nearly identical true PAT CADIGAN 113 V  | faces . I almost laughed out loud with the revelation . " They 're guilty , all right , " I said . " That is , they feel guilty , because they felt responsible for her and they did n't prevent her murder ! " All the Lazarians gathered around Entwater 's corpse turned their heads to look at me . Except one ; the last one , of course . " Pin a rose on you , " said the Pilot and patted my hand . " What next ? " " Trouble in Paradise , " I said . " There 's always trouble in Paradise , you can count on it , on any world . Because nobody can be that popular without someone getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Someone got real , real jealous . Killing jealous . " " No , " Farber said , enraged . " Jealous , yes , she had them all eating out of the palm of her hand practically , but I would n't ? I could n't ? " " And he did n't , " said Stilton . " We have n't looked at the readings for his third recording , but I 'd bet my life that they say he 's as truthful as those from the other two recordings . " " I know that , " I said , keeping my gaze on Farber . " He 's not a good liar . Not that good , anyway . And he 's not an alien . And he did n't have it quite right a minute ago  --  Entwater did n't have them all eating out of her hand , just almost all . You made a friend . One out of eighteen , not too popular , but a very , very devoted friend . A friend who loves you enough to be responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And for your anger and jealousy and hate . " Farber 's mouth was hanging open . I turned toward Stilton . " Number seventeen 's our murderer . " I paused . " For a minute there , I was about to tell you to get out the cuffs , but then I remembered . Diplomatic immunity . We have to leave it up to Thinta-ah to administer any justice  --  poor Thinta-ah , the consummate diplomat of the Lazarian species , torn between both of them . " To my surprise , Thinta-ah did n't seem the least bit embarrassed . On a human , the body language would have screamed pride . Aliens ; go figure . Stilton looked from the Lazarians in the group to the Pilot and then to me . " Are you sure ? " " Think about it , " I said . " If they were all to blame for not preventing her death , who was really to blame for causing it ? A Lazarian in love ? Or the one the Lazarian was in love with ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I had no idea . " He frowned . " How did you ? " I opened my mouth and then realized I could n't tell him . " The truth was staring me in the face all along , " I said after a long moment . " I just had to recognize it for what it was . " Farber spread his hands helplessly . " I do n't understand . " " I know . But one tip before we all get out of here . " I pulled him closer DIRTY WORK  | by his lapel . " Quit this job . You 're not suited for this kind of diplomacy . Really . I know this . " " I 'm not a diplomat , I 'm a secretary . I can get another secretarial job anywhere . But this was ... exotic , exciting ... " " Give it up , Farber , " I said , " or you 're going to find that office politics have suddenly turned fatal on you . " That seemed to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the table where Stilton and the Pilot were still sitting . " I 'd say this means we 're free to go . " " See for yourself , " said the Pilot and gestured at the center of the room . The group of Lazarians around Entwater had broken formation and were moving slowly away from the corpse , clustering in smaller groups of twos and threes . Space density . As if they had to breathe each other 's air or something . " Everyone maaaaaaaaaay leave , " said Thinta-ah , bowing to us . " The door is now in service . " " And the truth shall set you free , " Stilton muttered , committing everything in the ' viewer to long-term storage formats and then shutting it down . " Not bad , " I said . " In an awful kind of way . " " That 's what the truth is supposed to do , " he said stubbornly , pulling out the ' viewer strap so he could hang it on his shoulder . " That 's what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilot . The Pilot folded her hands briefly . " What is truth ? " She went back to the group of humans , who were all just starting to get warily up from their chairs . I stared after her . " What ? " said Stilton . " True faces . Celie Entwater died for human sins . Jesting Pilot . " " What ? " " Nothing , nothing . Let 's get out of here . "  | Mike Resnick strikes again . I do n't know what came over him in the early 1990s  --  suddenly and without warning , he became Anthology Man ( insert echo chamber effect here ) . Before he ran out of themes , I ran out of time , and when he called me up about Aladdin , I begged off . Which is one of the surest ways I know of to get an idea . I slid in under the wire with this one and he wedged it in with a shoehorn , I think . Now , I always figured that if a djinn ever showed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pre-set , no-substitutions kind of deal , take it or leave it ? like a Saturn dealership of the supernatural . Of course , I 'll probably grow old waiting ... V  | illie looked at the two fingers of Crown Royal in the glass ; only a sip was gone . Then she took a cautious sniff of the polishing rag in her left hand . " I 'm not a hallucination , " the djinn said in a kindly tone . The cloud he was sitting on had taken the shape of a reclining chair and he had obligingly lowered it so that it was hovering only a few inches from the carpet . He still filled most of the living room . " I 'll be the judge of that , " Millie said , putting the cloth down next to the brass lamp . " I 'm seventy years old this May and I will determine what is a hallucination and what is not . " " And I am six thousand years old as of last May , and I know when I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ djinn , rumbling a little . His eyes twinkled with good humor . Millie fanned the twinkles away with one hand , as if they were mosquitoes . She felt cool pinpricks where they touched her skin . " This must be it , " she said , looking at her hand . " My grandmother saw things , too , right before the end . She never said what , but we all knew there was something by the way her eyes would move around . Like she was dreaming with them open . Could you hold off until I can lie down on the couch ? I 'd rather not be found face down on the carpet . " The djinn moved the cloud-chair so that she could get to the couch without having to walk through the footrest . " This is not ' it , ' " he said as she kicked her shoes off and stretched out on the cushions . " In fact , you have a good many more years ahead of you . More than you anticipate . And of those , V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good health . That 's the good news . " Millie paused in the act of arranging one of the throw pillows for her head . " Oh , yeah ? So what 's the bad news ? " " There is none , " said the djinn . " I did not come to give you any bad news . In fact , I bring you a gift . " " Are you a hologram ? " she asked suddenly . " What ? " " A hologram . They can do that these days and do n't think I do n't know it , I 've been to Disneyworld , I 've been to Epcot Center , they 're just down the highway from here . If this is some kind of new-fangled junk-mail or advertising experiment ? " " What would make you think that ? " the djinn asked incredulously . " Come on , " Millie said , rolling her eyes . " After seventy years , you know all the pitches . The one about the free gift must be the oldest one in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was born at night , sonnyjim , but it was n't last night . " The djinn gave a sigh that sounded like a whirlwind ; Millie felt it stir her hair and , for the first time , began to get nervous . " This world is coming to I-don't-know-what , " he said sadly . " Wonder and magic has been co-opted by the basest of interests , miracles cheapened in the name of personal gain ? it makes me sad . I could weep . " She heard a splash and raised up on the couch . There was a wet spot on the carpet the size of a dinner plate ; the djinn was dabbing at his eyes with a diaphanous white scarf . " Oh , please do n't , " she said . " When this carpet gets wet , it smells like the Everglades and it takes forever to dry out . " She hesitated ; he looked so mournful that she felt sorry for him , in spite of the fact that he had to be a hallucination . He looked exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he could n't be real . " Look , I did n't ask you to come here ? " " Ah , but you did . " He pointed at the antique lamp she had been polishing when he had appeared . " You summoned me by rubbing the lamp . It contains the old metal from the original lamp . " With some effort , Millie twisted a bit so she could look at it . " That ? That 's been in my family for , oh , I do n't know . It 's just one of those old things we 've always seemed to have , I do n't know why I kept it . " " Yes , you have roots in the Middle East , did you know that ? " said the djinn conversationally . Millie laughed . " Take off that rubber nose . " " I am not wearing a rubber nose ! " the djinn said indignantly . The windows rattled . " I meant , stop pulling my  --  ah , stop kidding me . Stop joking around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in a quieter voice . " You have roots in PAT CADIGAN I ' '  | the Middle East , take my word for it . I 'm old enough to know . " " Yeah , you said . Six thousand last May . Bet you get a double GoldenAger discount when you tell them that at PharMor . " " Far more what ? " he asked . " Never mind . " She rolled over with her back to him and closed her eyes . " I 'm going to sleep you off and after I wake up , I 'm going to promise never to nip in the middle of the day again . " " Do n't doze off . You do n't want to sleep through this part , " said the djinn . " I have come with a gift . " " Yeah , yeah , you said that , too . " Millie giggled . " What is it , a trial subscription to U.S. Djinn Today ? " " No . A new life for the old . " Millie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you not to joke around . And that one was n't funny . " " But it would be for only one day , " the djinn went on solemnly . " What are you talking about ? " " I have come to give you the gift of one day of youth . Twenty-four hours of being young once more . " Millie stared at him and he stared back without flinching . " Right , " she said after a bit and put her back to him again . " You refuse ? " " I refuse to believe . " " Then accept , and see that it is as I say . " Pause . " If it is not , no harm can come to you . But if it is , you will have one more day of youth . Is that such a bad gift ? Is that not better than being reduced to a pile of ashes for disturbing a djinn 's rest ? " " That what you usually do ? " " No , I am a very good-tempered djinn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I thought djinns gave you three wishes , " she said , rolling over again to face him . " Or did the bidding of whoever owned the lamp for as long as they lived ? " " It 's complicated , " said the djinn . " My powers are great but restricted by circumstance  --  certain events , the times , the recession  --  you 'd have to be djinn to understand . I 'm fortunate that I can give you a gift at all , and I think it 's quite generous . " " A day of youth . " Millie laughed a little . " And what would I do with it ? " " Anything you wanted . For twenty-four hours . " She sighed . " Right . " She looked at the glass of Crown Royal , then at the lamp . " I 've polished that damned lamp for years and never  --  well , I did n't used to nip in the middle of the day , either . " " No , you did n't . Just say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . If I say no , I 'll always wonder . " " No , you wo n't . If you refuse  --  truly refuse  --  I will take the memory of the offer with me when I go . It would be unfair to leave you with such wondering . " " How considerate of you . " Millie laughed again . " Wait , I 've got it  --  I get this one day of youth and it costs me whatever time I 've got left , right ? That 's the catch , is n't it ? " " No , " the djinn said . " It is not . Just take the day . Take the day and make the most of it . You would know how . " " I sure would , " Millie said , more to herself . " Then it is done . See you tomorrow ! " Abruptly the living room was empty . " Hey ! " Without thinking , she got up a little too quickly . The room darkened and began to tilt . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her blood-pressure medicine . Then her vision cleared . She was ready for him when he reappeared exactly twenty-four hours later . The whole bottle of Crown Royal was on the coffee table in front of the couch ; she had just started working on it . " An experiment , " she said , in response to his pointed look . " I 'm going to see how far I can get with this in one sitting . Then I 'm going to take the pledge . " She paused to take a long sip from the glass she was holding . " And your lamp can tarnish forever , as far as I 'm concerned . " " You were not happy ? " the djinn asked in surprise . " Happy ? I was in ecstasy . You know , the aches and pains , they come on you so gradually over the years that you do n't realize how much there is , and then when it 's all gone at once ? " she shook her head . " You do n't realize how much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world , and then you 're back all at once and ? " she started to take another sip of the Crown Royal and then put the glass down . " You do n't realize how much you let get away . How much you just let go . You think there are things you do n't have room for in your life ? " she sat back , gazing past the djinn in his cloudy reclining chair . Her eyes were a little too bright . " I remember I used to say I was tired . When I was young , I mean . But I was n't tired . Now I 'm tired . But then  --  back then , I was never tired . I did n't know that . After you left , I ran out of here  --  I mean , I ran . My first experiment , you see . I ran just to feel myself running , to feel the muscles working and my heart pumping and to hear the sound of my breathing . I ran for blocks before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself in the window of a parked car and just PAT CAI ) 1GAN 121 V  | before I got a good look at myself , in that split-second before 1 really saw my own reflection , I thought , I must look like hell . " ' She laughed . " I do n't remember ever thinking that I was beautiful when I was young , I always thought there was too much of one thing , not enough of another , and so forth . Perhaps I just had bad eyesight in those days , perhaps my eyes are better now , because I can look at myself this minute and see that the beauty I had is still there . It 's been added to , but it 's still there . It always was . " " Go on , " said the djinn . " Go on . That 's what I should have told you : go on . And you 'd have gone and taken the memory of the offer with you , is n't that what you said ? I went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off my shoes and waded with some children , sailed leaf-boats with them , fed the ducks chunks of old bread , told them stories . " Fell in love .

Including how to live without him . He probably still does n't know what hit him , but he 'll never forget me . " I started a dance in a supermarket . I went into an office building where I had a job once , rode the elevator to the top floor and talked to everyone who got on and off it . I went to the zoo , bought a dozen balloons and gave them away to strangers . " After dark , I went to a hotel , rented the penthouse suite , and threw a party . I said it was my birthday . Everyone in the hotel came . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . The manager tore up the bill , said I was guest number one million and it was all on the house and by the way , Happy Birthday , young lady . " I shared my breakfast with a kid who was skipping school . I gave her what was left of my cash and told her to go to the zoo and buy some balloons . If you 're going to steal a day for yourself , I told her , make it one hell of a day to remember . " I fell in love again before lunch . He ' 11 never forget me , either . I bet he ' 11 never meet another woman who 'll buy him a dozen white roses . " She laughed . " And then I skipped lunch and ran all the way home without stopping . Must have been about five miles , give or take . I roamed pretty far and wide . " There was a long moment of silence . " It sounds like you had a good time then , " the djinn said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Millie laughed again . " It was extraordinary . It was miraculous . It was everything that youth never , ever , ever really is . " She looked at him from under her brows . " And we both know it . Do n't we . The djinn 's expression was slightly sheepish . " I do n't suppose we get  | to he seventy , or six thousand , without learning a lesson or two . " " But there are some we do n't learn until it 's  --  well , maybe not too late , but ... almost . " She finished the Crown Royal in the glass and poured herself another three fingers . " So now  --  do I say , thank you ' ? " " That would do . " She put a hand over her mouth briefly . " And if I 'd said no , you 'd have left me without even the memory of the offer ? I almost wish you had . " " Why ? " asked the djinn curiously . " Because here 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me fifty years ago , when I first polished that lamp for my mother . I wish you had come to me then and said , I am going to give you a gift , young girl , I am going to give you one day of age , one day of being old , so you will know what you will have then ... and what you have now . ' That 's what I really wish . " She took another sip of the Crown Royal . The djinn started to fade away , which did n't surprise her . She sat back on the couch and closed her eyes , not wanting to watch . " Millie ? " said the djinn 's voice . " What is it ? " she said , without opening her eyes . " I did . " The afternoon crept away .  | This is another early sale , from an idea that ambushed me during a slow afternoon at Hallmark . I jotted down an opening line , crossed it out , rewrote it and that was it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole story out , which I did ; this is what emerged from my typewriter ( I told you it was early ) . That 's the only time such a thing has happened to me . It 's a pretty fair representation of some uniquely female anxieties which is probably why it occurred that way . Though anyone who happens to be a parent can probably tell this was written before I became a parent myself  | ' m not a screamer , but I scream anyway . Once , loud and long , and when nothing happens at the end of it , I scream again , much louder and a good deal longer . And , still , nothing happens , nothing changes . There is still a charming little baby doll lying on its back in Rowena 's crib with its butter-soft plastic limbs sticking up in the air and its Cupid's-bow mouth permanently puckered around a small hole meant for a baby-doll bottle . I do not touch the doll ; the fingerprints of whoever took Rowena and left it in her place could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of that even if I am screaming . I look at the window . It 's open but I opened it myself this morning . If the kidnapper came in that way , he was careful to close the screen behind him when he left . I back out of the room slowly  --  nice room , decorated bit by bit all the months I was pregnant , pleasant without being icky-sweet  --  and run down the hall to the stairs . Someone is banging on the front door , hard , and the doorbell is going mad , bonging so fast it can barely keep up with itself . I hesitate , clutching the rail until I hear Betty Thornton 's voice calling over and over , " Sharon , are you all right ? Sharon ? Sharon ? " She 's heard me , I realize . I screamed and she heard me . I run down the stairs , thumping , almost slipping on the carpeting and fetch up against the door . Clumsily , I paw the chain lock off and flip the deadbolt , thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the chain lock and the deadbolt . Then the door is open and Betty 's mouth is moving and her eyes are blinking and she shakes me hard , even though I 'm not screaming any more . 3 I ) IItTY WO It K  | " Rowena 's gone , " I tell her . " Someone took her . Someone climbed through her bedroom window and took her . " Betty is all in-charge and calm authority . She has three children , and she knows when to get the Band-Aids and when to call the hospital . " Are you sure ? " she says , giving me a final shake to settle everything inside me back where it should be . " Are you sure she did n't just crawl off somewhere ? " " She was having her nap in her crib , " I tell her . " She ca n't crawl well enough , and even if she could , she could n't get out of her crib without falling . I would have heard her ! " This convinces Betty . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone . She dials the police from memory  --  memory , she 's that kind of mother  --  and speaks quickly but clearly . When she finishes , she looks toward the stairs and then at me , and decides to stay down here . " They 'll be here right away , " she says , sitting down and folding one arm around my shoulder . " You calm down so you can tell them what happened . I 'll be right here by you . " I ask her what about her own kids , out playing with a child-snatcher loose , and she tells me not to worry , they are n't babies and they wo n't go with strangers . I worry anyway , thinking the kidnapper must be collecting children , picturing him  --  yes , him , kidnappers have always been hims to me  --  with a large black sack of dolls . He is exchanging them for children , and now Rowena is at the bottom of the sack , suffocating under a load of squirming arms and legs , all children he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? Betty dabs at my face with a tissue , and I realize I 'm crying tears of fear . Tears of fear , tears of fear , my mind says over and over until the police come in the still-open front door . I jump up . Betty restrains me from flinging myself at the uniforms . All I really see are the uniforms , deep dark blue with shiny , no-fooling badges . And guns . God bless the guns , they look so beautifully huge . They 'll shoot the man with the sack dead , and all the children will come home again . Rowena , too . It takes both me and Betty to tell them what 's wrong . They look from one of us to the other , following the volley of our words back and forth . Then one says , " Bert , you have a look upstairs . Try to stay calm , Mrs. Petersen . Where is your husband ? " I tell him I 'm divorced as Bert goes up the stairs . I can see by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gun , even though I 've said there is no one up there . " Could her father have taken her ? " the policeman asks me . I shake my head . Am I sure ? I 'm sure . Was there a custody fight ? No , no custody fight . I am explaining that I am between jobs and living on savings with Betty interpreting the garbled spots , when Bert comes to the head of the stairs and says , " Dave , you 'd better have a look at this . " Dave looks up at his partner and sees something very , very bad , PAT CA1 ) IGAN Ir ( V  | something I have not seen , and I grab at Betty until she has to press my hands between hers . Then he looks at me and sees something even worse , and I think that the man with the sack must have dropped Rowena , dropped her out the window and killed her , and they think I did it . We all go up the stairs , Betty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her . He leads us down the hall to the cheerful-awful room . If Betty were not holding me , I would not be able to go in . But she is being brave for me , and we do go in . Bert is already back in the room , looking not out the window but down into the crib . Dave goes across the room and looks , too . Then they both turn to me and Bert says , " Mrs. Petersen , do you take drugs ? " Betty disengages herself from me and walks to the crib as though the floor were made of eggs . I stand just inside the doorway all alone now , unable to think why they are asking me if I take drugs ? Drugs ? Drugs ? What have they found in Rowena 's crib that I did not see ? All three of them are staring at me and their eyes say they can not believe themselves . So I go , too , across the room and look down into the crib . The doll is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ca n't move unless I move it , and I have n't moved it because of the fingerprints . Betty touches my shoulder the way I have seen her touch her best crystal . " See , Sharon ? " she says . " Rowena must have , ah , crawled under the blanket and hid from you . " Her eyes are not right , the way they 're on me . Bert  --  or Dave , suddenly I can no longer tell them apart  --  lifts the doll 's little shirt with a careful finger . The afternoon sun is harsh on the plastic navel-less stomach . " About three months , is that right ? She seems well-treated . " He sounds dubious , but then he smiles . " Do n't want to wake the little beauty . Maybe we 'd better go back to the living room and , ah , thrash this out . " The other policeman  --  marked Shelton , I see for the first time , but I still do n't know if it 's Bert or Dave  --  is having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he ca n't decide whether he should look at me or Betty . Betty 's arm slips around my shoulders and grips me firmly . " I think we should call someone first , officer , " she says . " Someone to look after the baby while I stay with Sharon . " The baby ? " The baby ? " I say , looking into Betty 's face . I ca n't believe I heard her right , but there is something she finds equally incredible of me . I can tell . Our eyes are mirrors . Then I jump forward and yank the light summer blanket out of the crib . It 's yellow , soft , with little green horses galloping all over it . " Do you see a baby hiding in this blanket ? " I demand , shaking it to show there 's nothing in it , nothing at all . I throw it on the floor and pick up a rattle . " Can a baby hide behind this ? Or this ? " I am plucking Rowena 's toys out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soft plastic train , a teddy bear , and hurling them to 1 ) IRtTY WORK  | the floor until there is nothing on the mattress but that hideous sweet doll . I grab it up by one leg and hold it out over the floor . " Do you see a baby here ? " I shout . " Do you ? This is just a doll ! It 's nothing but a doll ! " The silence in the room is horrified . Then the Shelton policeman has his hands under the doll as though it were alive . He looks into my eyes and he says , so quietly , so gently , " Mrs. Petersen , please let go . " I do and now I am the horrified one , because he is holding that thing like a baby , exactly the way you should hold a baby , and its eyes are open . It 's an expensive doll with eyes that fall open and closed , and brown curly hair , not just painted on , the kind you can really comb . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it looks nothing like Rowena . Her hair is dark , yes , but not so curly and her mouth is not a frozen Cupid's-bow . But the Shelton policeman is murmuring to it , and Betty 's hands are fluttering around me like pesky birds , and the other policeman is saying , " Mrs. Thornton , do you know Mrs. Petersen well enough to tell if this is her daughter ? " And Betty says Oh , God , Betty says  --  she says " Yes , that 's Rowena . I 've baby-sat her and I have three of my own . I know one child from another and that 's Rowena . " I slap her traitorous paws away from me . How can she ? How can she ? Anyone can see it is n't a child ! Anyone but Betty and these two awful policemen . And then Betty is telling them all kinds of things about me , about how Rowena broke up my marriage because Jeff could n't stand her getting all my attention and how I lost my job and blamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming and I would have gone on sleeping if Betty had n't come by and Rowena began choking and I did n't know what to do and I use sleeping pills because I ca n't adjust to the divorce . " You sneak ! " I shout in her face . " You snooped in my medicine cabinet , how dare you ! " Betty looks hurt , like I slapped her , but she 's the one who slapped me , going through my things , telling the police gossip about me , insisting this plastic thing is Rowena . They all look to each other , and I see they have decided on a common expression to use because their faces are identical when they turn to me again . The Shelton policeman gently transfers the doll they think is Rowena to Betty 's arms , and I run out of the room . I only mean to run into the hall where I wo n't have to watch this travesty , but the policemen holler in rough voices . They scare me so much I run down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get in . The Police are thundering down the steps after me , and that scares me even more because they are obviously deranged , mistaking a doll for my Rowena .  | I 'm out the screen door with them still chasing me when I realize they are not deranged at all , they are in league with the man with the sack . And then I really run , pumping my legs for all I 'm worth , across the street without looking and between two houses . My chest is burning already , I 'm no jogger , but I keep going because if I stop I wo n't stand a chance of getting Rowena back . They 'll force me to accept the doll and treat it like a baby , and I 'll never see my daughter again . Behind the houses is an alleyway where the garbage trucks go to pick up trash . I cut across the unfenced yard on the right , surprising the man standing at the barbecue with a steak speared on a long fork . I see in passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving trucks and cars around . The man with the sack would n't dare try to take that little boy , his father would stab him like a steak with that fork , I just know it . I do n't wonder what the father thinks about the policemen chasing me across his yard . I ca n't think about anything except getting away and the burning that has become a squeezing wildfire in my chest . The alley is cracked and pitted with ice heaves and potholes , but I 'm leaping over them and skirting around them . I 'm not going to trip and fall . I 'd let Rowena down if I tripped , and I 'm not going to let her down this time . At the end of the alley I see the police car pull up and stop . I veer away to the left , and almost before I know it , I leap a fence , hit the grass on my feet and keep running , glad for once all I ever wear are jeans and sneakers , nothing nicer . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the front gate . Then across another street , into another yard and down another alley . My knees are beginning to weaken , my thighs are shaky , and there is no oxygen in the great whoops of air I take . But I run , for Rowena I run between the houses and down the sidewalks until the houses are n't even vaguely familiar and the penned dogs in the fenced yards snarl in deadly earnest , smelling the total stranger of me , just the way they would snarl at the man with the sack if he came here . When I finally pound to a stop , my whole body jarred with each slowing step and my chest rising and collapsing like crazy bellows , when I bend over coughing with my trembling hands on my watery knees , no one comes up behind me to say I 'm under arrest . I am alone . I have outrun the police . All for Rowena . I see now that it 's true that maternal instinct enables a woman to perform superhuman feats . By outrunning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am a good mother and have the maternal instinct . I could chew through solid steel to get to my child . I could lift ten thousand pounds if my child were under them . I could sprout wings and fly to the moon if my child were stranded there . I would never let her lie for hours in dirty diapers while I slept knocked-out on sleeping pills . A doll perhaps , but not Rowena . I look around as my breath comes back , but there are still no police in DIRTY WORK  | sight . It is a miracle that they do n't know where I am . I 'm standing on the sidewalk of a street not very unlike my own . I wonder if the babies on this street will grow up to go to school with Rowena after I get her back . Across from me is the edge of the park , where older children go to play on the swings and the seesaws and hang upside-down on the jungle gym , or just run around on the grass or climb on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come here and carry off unattended children , leaving dolls lying on the ground for their grieving mothers to find later . It occurs to me he is there now , wandering through the park with his sack . I will find him and grab that sack away from him and wrestle Rowena out of it . Then I 'll run home and show them , all of them , the policemen and that gossipy Betty Thornton and the man with the fork , that my Rowena could n't possibly be that doll . I go quickly across the street and into the park , down a grassy slope to the picnic table area . The swings and seesaws and jungle gym are further on . I can hear the children playing on them . I 'm heading straight for the voices when I see the woman sitting reading at the picnic table with the doll standing nearby . I ca n't help it . I have to stop when I see the doll . It 's three feet high and its skin is too pink to be real , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect . Yes , I recognize it now , from when I was a little girlie s a Shirley Temple doll , left there by the man with the sack . He has exchanged it for the real little girl while her mother was reading , and the real little girl is now in the sack with Rowena and the other children . And then I realize that this doll he has left is my doll , mine . I take a step toward it . The woman closes her book with a snap and stands up . " Time to go home , Denice . Daddy ' 11 be home any time now and he wants his supper when he wants it . " The doll just stands . Of course it does n't answer . It just smiles and holds its arms out as though it were a real little girl who wanted a hug . But it is n't . The woman does n't seem to know this . " Do n't one-more-minute me , we 've been out here for hours , let 's go ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away across the grass . The doll bumps along clumsily and after a few steps the woman stops . " Pickup your feet , ca n't you ? You 're wearing down your shoes and they cost a goddamn fortune ! " She gives the doll an angry yank . I put my hands over my face and turn away . This is too horrible . The woman does n't know her little girl is gone . She has no maternal instinct , not like me . I force myself to walk in the other direction . It 's too late for her . If I find her little girl when I get Rowena back from that awful man with the sack , I will keep her myself . I 'll tell the police she 's my niece or my cousin . I wo n't let them take her ; they do n't know the difference between a real girl and a doll , either . PAT CADIGAN II V  | Almost to the swings , I stop again . There is a little girl , a real little girl sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to rub my eyes because the afternoon light makes the doll almost  --  almost , not quite  --  look like a baby . But it 's stiff , with straight blonde hair that is obviously fake , like a bad wig . The little girl is holding it and talking to it as though it were a baby , the way little girls play . I think , how sweet , and then , no , no . Little girls should n't play just with dolls . They should have other toys so they wo n't be stereotyped , so they wo n't be fooled into thinking they have the maternal instinct if they really do n't have it . When I get Rowena back I 'll let her have only one doll . Just one . So she wo n't get fooled , like The little girl suddenly holds the doll up and says , " Alice Ann , you 're a bad , bad girl ! " And then for no reason she lays the doll across her lap and spanks her ! I rush over . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punish her this way ? " The girl looks up at me . She is a solemn little thing of eight or nine . I hope Rowena will be much happier when she 's that age and not spank the one doll I give her . " Who 're you ? " the girl asks . Her hand still hovers over that poor , no , plastic bottom . I squat down and pick the doll out of her lap , straightening its clothes and stroking its hair . It 's a very pretty doll , though nowhere near as pretty as Rowena . Not even as pretty as the doll that the man with the sack left in its , her place . This doll has only painted eyes that stay open even during naptime . Painted eyelashes , too , and raggedy hair . But it 's pretty because it 's a baby . A baby doll . " I 'm a mommy , " I tell the girl . " A real mommy with a real baby . " " Where is it ? " " She . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little brat , but then I see she ' s not really unkind , just thoughtless . She lacks the maternal instinct . Her little face is innocent . " She 's not with me right now . I 'm on my way to get her . You should treat your baby much gentler . She 's only a little tiny girl and she ca n't take spankings yet . " When I get Rowena back , I 'll never spank her unless she 's really , really bad . That 's not going to be till she 's much older , naturally . The girl takes the doll away from me and holds her possessively . Holds her all wrong , too . " Not like that , " I say . " You 'll hurt her . Hold her like this , with your arm supporting her little head . There . That 's right . Make a cradle of your arms . " The girl is watching me with suspicion , but I do n't care . They 're all suspicious at that age . Except I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible thing can happen if you do n't treat your baby right .

That is n't right . I know it is n't because I 'm not in the sack . " If you 're not good to your little girl , " I begin again more confidently , " a man with a great big black sack will come and take your baby away and he 'll leave a doll in her place . You would n't want that to happen , would you ? " The girl looks down at the doll and up at me again . " But Alice Ann is a doll .

" We are halfway through our third time singing it when the police finally catch up with me . It has taken a lot of fast talking , but they have n't locked me up . I could tell they did n't really want to as we rode back to my house in the patrol car . The police are very busy and do n't lock someone up just because she has the maternal instinct . That is n't a crime . I did n't tell them about the man with the sack , though , and I guess that is a crime , but they 'd never find him anyway . Only mothers can find him , mothers who really have the maternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went straight into the house and found Betty sitting in the living room in my rocking chair , rocking the doll . The sight of her with it in her arms made me so tired . I did n't argue with her . I just took the doll from her and held it exactly the way she did . Then I sat down in the rocking chair and I rocked the doll . Betty talked to the policemen for a long time , but I did n't pay any attention . I just stared at the doll , moving it up and down so its eyes opened and closed more like a real child 's would . The policemen finally went away but Betty stayed . She called her husband and then she sat down on the couch and watched me . She 's still sitting there and she 's still watching me , but not as closely as she was . She keeps looking at the electric clock on the TV set , like she 's waiting . Well , I 'm waiting , too . The front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen . After Betty leaves , I 'm going to let the front door stay open like that , with the screen door unlocked . I have an idea . If I 'm very , very good to this doll and demonstrate that I really do have the maternal instinct by changing her diapers right away and not sleeping through her crying , the man with the sack might come back and return Rowena . It 's a chance . I could have been wrong , back there in the park . Maybe if you 're good to your doll , the man with the sack comes and gives you a real baby . Maybe he 'll come this evening . I 'm going to expect him . Betty acts like she 's expecting someone herself . Could n't be him , though . PAT C A D I G A N V  | Betty always had the maternal instinct . It 's inevitable after three kids , I bet . But I 've had only Rowena , and I did n't have her very long . Nonetheless , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove it with the doll . And yet , that could be a problem , I think to myself , moving the doll up and down . The eyes open and close . Open and close . Click-click . Clickclick . Dolls never cry . How will I know when she 's hungry ? How will she tell me ?  | I do n't swim . I can , but I do n't . I wo n't . When my friends ask why , I usually make a joke about how 20 million years ago , we crawled out of the water onto the land and I do n't care to go back . But the truth is , I know  --  I know in my gut ? that if you go into the water , you die . I know this because it happened to one of my playmates when I was a kid . He went off to swimming lessons and never came back . Horrifyingly , no one missed him until his mother met the returning bus . A year later , I failed my own swimming test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I could n't see the bottom . " Smart girl , " said my mother when she came to pick me up . " Remember that when you get interested in boys . " But I failed at the Y , too , where you could see every inch of the bottom from end to end . It was n't a matter of what you could or could n't see  --  it was being in the water . Eventually , I deigned to learn to swim well enough to save my own life should I fall , sans lifejacket , out of one of the fishing charters I spent so much time on catching flounder off Cape Cod . Loved deep-sea fishing , never a bad moment . Boats on the water were OK . You in the water forget about it .  | The pond was evil . That was a sad , silly thought to have on such a beautiful May afternoon with the trees whispering in the fresh wind and the distant sounds of insects buzzing and birds singing coming to her dreamily from the small woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself was lovely , smooth and untroubled today , reflecting the surrounding trees like dark glass . Occasionally ripples appeared here and there on its surface , spreading out from tiny points where something had pricked the water . It should have been an idyllic spot . Paula Stromsted leaned back on her palms and looked at her five-yearold daughter Richie , who was trying unsuccessfully to weave a garland of the flowers and leaves wilting in a pile between her folded legs . She had seen a picture of fairies dancing with wreaths of flowers around their heads in a storybook and the idea had captivated her . The girl worked meticulously with the tremendous concentration only the very young seemed capable of . After a few moments , she felt her mother 's gaze on her and looked up . " Mommy , I just ca n't get them to go in a circle like in the book . They wo n't stay . " She wrapped two daisy stems around each other and grimaced when they fell apart . " See ? " Paula sat up , brushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you say we head back to Grandma 's house for something cold to drink ? We 've been down here for almost an hour and I 'm getting thirsty .

" " It 's a different favoritest , " Richie said seriously . " Can we stay one more mimit ? " " Minute . " " Minute . Please , Mommy ? " She sighed . " Just one . Then we go back to the house and no arguments , OK ? " " Well , OK . " The girl got up and went looking for more flowers , bending over with her hands on her knees in a perfect imitation of her grandmother inspecting the vegetable garden . Paula felt a little guilty . How was a little girl to understand the way she felt about the pond ? To Richie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a place to play and daydream , a welcome change from their cramped apartment in the city and the tiresomely cheerful daycare center where she spent the hours Paula was at work . For Paula , it was something else . Dare you . Double dare you . Darers go first . She closed her eyes . That day twenty-five years ago had been warm and beautiful , too , when she and her cousin Jeffrey had come down to the pond to play Robin Hood . She and Jeff did n't always get along very well  --  there was something cold and mean in the bright blue eyes that grownups were always exclaiming over , much to her Aunt Kitty 's proud delight . Hasn ' t he got the most beautiful blue eyes ? people would say . For some reason , they never saw the meanness that was waiting to come out later as a painful twisting pinch on Paula 's arm or a foot stuck out to trip her when she was running or the slow , thorough dissection of a grasshopper while the tormented creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had seen it . Her mother had seen it , too , and was n't happy about it . But Jeff was her only sister 's boy , she 'd told Paula , and they had to try to be nice to him . Maybe if he saw how people were supposed to behave , he 'd try harder to be good and the meanness inside of him would shrink away to nothing . Paula had tried , but privately she felt that Jeffrey would always be a nasty little boy even after he 'd grown up . And people would still be oohing and ahhing over his beautiful blue eyes . She had n't wanted to come down to the pond with Jeffrey that day . But he was just there for the weekend with Aunt Kitty and Uncle Rob and there was n't anyone else around to play with . Jeffrey had seemed a little nicer than usual but as soon as they 'd gotten to the pond , he 'd started making fun of her . She was a girl ; girls were stupid and weak and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snake and scare her with it . She was n't scared of anything , she 'd insisted , and there were n't any snakes anyway .

There 's snakes in that pond . If you 're not scared of em , I dare you to swim in it . Steadfastly , she had shaken her head . He knew as well as she did that they were n't even supposed to go wading . Her father had warned them they could get sick from the water , which was murky and muddy . As well , the bottom was treacherous , parts of it suddenly dropping down ten feet or more without warning . But Jeff had kept after her . I dare you . Double dare you . Darers go first , she 'd said primly . And then he had spotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a No Special Reason surprise . Jeff 's parents never gave him No Special Reason surprises and he was very jealous . She 'd taunted him a little about it ; she could n't help it . At last she had something she could lord over him . She should have known better , her mother had told her later . She should have realized she could n't get the better of Jeffrey 's meanness . He had demanded that she hand the watch over . When she would n't , he chased her , tackled her , and tore the watch from her wrist . Paula still remembered her enraged frustration as , still sitting on her chest , he began to put it on his own wrist . Then he saw the picture of Cinderella on the dial . A stupid girl 's watch ! Shoulda known it would be a stupid girl 's watch ! But he would n't give it back to her , no matter how much she demanded and pleaded . He got up off her and went down to the edge of the pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could stop him , he had lobbed it almost halfway across the pond . There was only a tiny splash when it hit the water and the ripples it made were soon gone . Now you 'll have to swim in the pond if you want to get your stupid watch back . Dare you to . Double dare you . Paula had run home crying , knowing with bitter satisfaction as she sobbed and hiccupped out her story that Jeffrey was really going to get it for this one . He must have known it , too , she 'd realized later , and it had n't made the slightest difference to him . The pleasure of the act outweighed the consequences for him and that had frightened her . She could still see him as he had been , standing at the water 's edge grinning nastily at her , enormously pleased with himself . The mental image chilled her . It was almost as if he was there still , standing in that exact spot and if she opened her eyes she would see him , still eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jump in and get her watch . The wind rustling the trees died down and a quiet settled over everything . Paula opened her eyes . A small figure was standing at the water 's edge , leaning forward and peering curiously into the pond . " Richie ! " Paula jumped up . " Richie , get away from there ! " She hurried 140 I ) I It T T W 0 It K  | over and jerked the little girl hack from the water . " What ? I did n't do anything ! " Richie stared up at her with round , startled eyes . Paula pressed her lips together , suddenly embarrassed . " I know , honey , " she said after a moment , stroking the child 's soft fair hair . " I just do n't want you to go near the water . I 've told you that before , remember ? " Richie nodded . " I just thought I saw something in there . Something shiny . " " You were wrong , " Paula said firmly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . " She did n't look over her shoulder at the pond as she and Richie walked up the road . " Did you and Richie have a nice walk ?

" Her mother pursed her lips . " It 's a pretty spot . " " Yes . She seems quite drawn to it . She 's made me take her down there every day . " Paula half-rose from her chair to look out the window over the sink . Richie was in the back yard picking dandelions , presumably to try her luck at making a garland of them . " You do n't sound very happy about that . " " Why should I be ? " " Paula , that was such a long time ago .

There was something terribly wrong with Jeff . Aunt Kitty and Uncle Rob refused to see it . Not Rob so much as Kitty , really . She thought the sun just rose and set on her darling Jeffrey . " Her mother sighed , folding her wrinkled hands around her glass . " Kitty had a lot of trouble delivering Jeffrey . It almost killed her and she never could have any more children . That was the saddest part , I thought . " She sighed again and gave Paula a pained smile . " That was all Kitty had , being Jeffrey 's mother . It was n't like it is today for women .

" I sound crazy , do n't I ? " " Obsessed . Perhaps you should n't go to the pond any more . " " Perhaps I should n't . " Paula sipped her lemonade . It had gone warm and the taste was sourly cloying . " But Richie would be so disappointed . And I certainly do n't want her going down there alone . If something happened , I 'd never forgive myself . " " Sometimes I do n't think you have ever forgiven yourself . " Paula blinked . " Say again ? " " I do n't think you 're really glad about what happened . You 're not that kind of person . At least I hope you 're not . I think maybe the little girl inside you still takes Kitty 's awful words to heart and keeps them there . " " Oh , for God 's sake .

I never did . If you want to know the truth ? " she turned away from the window ? " I do n't even feel guilty about not feeling guilty . It might have been me instead . " Her mother shook her head . " If you ask me , that 's what 's poisoning the pond for you . You were talking a little while ago about Jeffrey being abnormal , not quite right . What about the way you keep harping on this ? You insist on working yourself up about it . If you could stop living in the past , you 'd be a lot better off . " " I do n't live in the past . " " When it comes to Jeffrey , you do .

" Her mother pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , you 'd better think about getting some help because it 's going to turn you into a sad case . " She left the room , her footsteps loud on the hardwood floor . Paula turned back to the window . Her mother had never known what it was like to be at Jeff 's mercy . That was the sort of thing that could really leave a mark on a person . She fixed herself a glass of ice water to get the taste of the lemonade out of her mouth . If only she could rid herself of the taste of Jeffrey as easily . She leaned against the counter , sipping her water thoughtfully . - l/ DIRTY WORK V  | She had found the grown-ups sitting at the kitchen table playing whist when she had come home wailing from the pond .

Now , Rob , do n't hit him . Kitty , sounding syrupy about Jeff as usual . Striking a child does n't teach him anything . Her parents had kept quiet except to try to comfort her . Not long after , Jeff had come in and there 'd been a scene , mostly Kitty shouting at her husband while shielding a smirking Jeff with her body . In the end he 'd gotten a mild spanking , after which Kitty brought him to Paula so he could deliver an apology and promises to pay for the watch out of his allowance and never to do such an awful thing again , all of it dictated to him by Kitty and played back with occasional prompting . Paula had stared at him through the whole thing until he got to the end . He smirked all the way through it . She knew all the adults were looking at her , waiting for her to be very grown-up and ladylike about everything and accept the artificial apology . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgiveness , she had reared back and exploded . I 'll never forgive you ! she had screamed into his face , startling him so much that his smirk had actually disappeared for a few seconds . I hate you and I wish you were dead ! Kitty had clutched her son to her side in horror while Paula 's father ? a bit reluctantly , it seemed to her at the time  --  marched her upstairs to her room and told her to stay there until after supper . Paula had known her outburst would strain relations between the two families even further , but she had n't cared . Or had tried not to . Later , her mother had had a quiet talk with her on the virtue of being civilized and not sinking to a certain other person 's level . Her father had been more understanding ; he tucked her in with a promise to teach her how to defend herself . The next morning the situation had escalated into frenzy when Kitty discovered the front door open and Jeffrey missing . Sometime during the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Because of what Paula had screamed at him , Kitty said . He had run away because his feelings were hurt . Paula had doubted it . Rob and her father had driven all over the county looking for him while Kitty sobbed and she hid in her room . It was just after lunchtime when the phone rang . Paula 's mother had answered it . She could n't quite remember the exact sequence of events after that , or exactly when she had found out what had happened and from whom . Her father had stopped at the pond on the way back to the house and found PAT CADIGAN 14 , E V  | Jeffrey 's shoes and socks near the water . lie and Rob had called the police from the grocery store down the road .

Paula had said she would never forgive him so Jeff had gone out to the pond to try to get her watch , just so they could be friends again . And it was Paula 's curse that had done it . She had wished him dead and now he was . Paula had found herself strangely numbed by the whole experience . She felt a little regret and a certain amount of horror for how the boy had died . But through it all she could n't shake the thought that if Jeff had really been trying to retrieve her watch , it was only because he had n't wanted to give up part of his allowance to pay for it . But that had n't been why he 'd gone out to the pond . Dare you . Double dare you , he 'd said . Darers go first , she 'd replied . And so he had .

Even Kitty had apologized to her , months after the funeral Paula had n't attended , telling her she had n't meant all the awful things she 'd said . But the apology had had a curious flat sound to it , as though it had been fed to her the way she had fed Jeffrey 's to him . But it did n't seem right , when Paula thought about it , that her feelings about Jeffrey should still be so strong . The image of the pond appeared in her mind and she felt herself tense . Jeffrey was the pond to her now and always would be . Well , she could help herself by refusing to dwell on it , starting right at that moment . She looked out the window again . Richie was still crouched down on the grass , studying something . Paula smiled . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The memory of Jeff 's death had persuaded her to take Richie for toddler swimming lessons at the Y before she was even three years old .

" What 's up , buttercup ? " she asked , ruffling Richie 's hair . Richie looked up at her guiltily . There was a pile of dandelions beside her and grass smears on her knees . Something small and brown wriggled between her fingers . " Richie ! " Horrified , Paula slapped the grasshopper out of her daughter ' s 111 DIRTY WORK V  | grasp and stamped on it . ' ' hen she yanked the girl to her feet and shook her . " What were you doing ? " Richie tried to shrink away . " Nothing , Mommy , I ? " " That 's a terrible thing to do , a terrible , evil thing ! How would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by bit ! How could you ? How could you ? " Richie flopped back and forth in her hands . " Mommy , you 're hurting ! " " See ? See what it 's like ? " " I only caught him , I was only looking at him ? " Paula 's grip tightened on the child 's arm . " Do n't ever let me see you doing anything like that again ! " Richie burst into tears . " I did n't do anything ! I was just looking at him and you killed him ! You killed him ! " Paula released her and the girl fled into the house , wailing for her grandmother . Uncertainly , Paula watched her go and then looked down at the crushed insect in the grass . With her shoe , she mashed the remains into unrecognizability and kicked the dying dandelions over them . " You know , " Paula 's mother said , looking up from the magazine on her lap , " little kids do n't really know that kind of thing is wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She may have been just looking at the grasshopper like she said . " Paula looked away from the television program she had n't really been able to concentrate on and shifted her position in the overstuffed chair . " Maybe she was . But I recognized that position , the way she was holding her fingers . It was the way Jeffrey looked when he was pulling those poor things apart . " " Paula , really . Jeffrey again . And all over a bug . " " Really yourself , Ma . Suppose it were a puppy or a kitten ? " Her mother leaned against the arm of the couch and put her feet up on the cushions . " Richie would never do anything like that . " " Not anymore , that 's for sure . " Her mother made a disgusted noise and set her magazine aside . It was this week 's Rolling Stone , Paula noted with detached amusement . " You scared that poor kid almost into hysterics . And over nothing ! All little children are fascinated by insects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to figure out how they work . Like an experiment . It 's curiosity , Paula , not sadism . " " It 's sadistic , whether they realize it or not . I 'm not going to stand for that . Richie is going to realize that other living things are entitled to exist unmolested . " " I suppose you never did anything of the sort , " her mother said sarcastically . PAT CAI ) ICAIN I4 V  | " Did you ever catch me at it ? " " It 's occurred to me that there was probably a good deal that I did n't catch you at . " " Well , I never did anything like that . " " Never ? Not even once ? Never picked the wings off a fly ? Or a ladybug ? " " No . " Paula suppressed the memory of watching Jeffrey with horrified fascination when she had first seen him removing the hind legs of a grasshopper . What he had done after that had made her feel sick . Her mother shrugged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merciful , a sensitive little soul who never harmed a fly . If you insist . " She picked up the magazine again and leafed through it to find her place . " But I still think your reaction was entirely inappropriate , no matter what Richie was doing or not doing . " " I am not going to have her turn out like Jeffrey . " " Jesus Christ ! " Her mother slammed the magazine down on her knees . " Jeffrey , Jeffrey , Jeffrey ! I had less of him when he was alive ! Once and for all , Paula , lose this hang-up you 've got about him . He 's dead . Twenty-five years dead . Lay him to rest ! " Paula said nothing , turning her gaze back to the television set . The images on the screen made no sense at all to her . " You only have a few more days of vacation left , " her mother went on quietly . " Try to make them pleasant . For Richie ' s sake . And you ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . " She looked at Paula sharply from under her eyebrows . " Believe me , it 's far more important for grownups to apologize to children then vice-versa . That is , if you really want akid to grow up with the kind of integrity you want her to have . " " All right , " Paula said resignedly . " I 'll go up and talk to her . " Her mother was smiling as Paula walked out of the living room and into the front hall . At the foot of the stairs she paused , frowning at the open front door . The dying sunlight made a red-gold block on the floor . The screen door was n't even latched . Paula shook her head . An authority on children and a subscriber to Rolling Stone and her mother still could n't remember to lock the front door at night . Anyone could get in ... She froze in the act of closing the heavy wooden door . Anyone could get in  --  or out . " Richie ! " she yelled , pounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the hallway on the second floor and burst into her daughter 's room . " Richie ! " She did n't have to turn on the light to see the empty bed , still neatly made . " Richie ! " She pounded back down the stairs , colliding with her mother at the bottom . 140 I ) I II .

" " Have you looked in the back y ? " " You look ! I know where she is ! " Paula ran out the front door , feeling her pocket for her car keys . " Where are you going ? " her mother called after her . " The pond ! " Paula jumped into the car and fumbled the key into the ignition , ignoring her mother 's plea to wait . It took her just a little over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the only place Richie could have run to . To her favoritest spot , because she was angry and she knew she was n't supposed to go there by herself . Paula forced herself to press lightly on the accelerator , in case the girl suddenly appeared walking in the middle of the road . " Richie , " she moaned , her hands trembling on the steering wheel . " Richie , if I catch up to you ? " Her heart thudded when she realized what she 'd said . When she reached the pond , she pulled on to the dirt shoulder and put on the emergency flashers . " Richie ! " she yelled , running the fifty yards down to the spot where they 'd been sitting earlier . " Richie ! " Her voice echoed , shattering the quiet . A few feet from the water she stopped , listening for the sound of an answer . The trees rustled , patchy silhouettes against the darkening sky . " Richie , please answer me ! I 'm not mad at you , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She spotted the shoes sitting side by side on the ground with the little white socks stuffed neatly inside them at the same time as she heard the splashing . " Mommy ! " Far out in the pond , two little arms waved , scrabbling at the air before they dipped below the surface . Then she felt it , like the terrible oppressiveness before the onset of a storm . She had been right after all . Jeffrey had poisoned the pond , but in a hideous , evil way she 'd never dreamed of . He 'd been there , waiting to get her for twenty-five years and when he knew he never would , he 'd gone to work on Richie , drawing her to the pond , luring her into the water . If Jeffrey could n't have Paula , he 'd take Richie and , in a way , that was better for him . Jeffrey had always known exactly what would hurt her the most . All this passed through her mind in less than a second . Then she was tearing into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms that had bobbed to the surface again and the choking voice that cried Mommy ! with hopeless terror . The filthy water splashed into her eyes and mouth as she struggled PAT CADIGAN H ( V  | against it . It seemed as though she were moving with terrible slowness , as though the water were becoming as thick as hardening molasses . Every time she looked up , Richie seemed further away than ever , her voice becoming weaker . Paula strained against the water , feeling it resist her almost like a live thing . You ca n't have her , Jeffrey ! her mind screamed . You ca n't take her from me , I wo n't let you ! The water suddenly churned around her , bubbling madly , sucking at her arms and legs , pulling her down . Panic exploded inside her like an electric shock . She fought to keep herself at the surface , to stay in sight of her daughter . The drag became more powerful , the water lifting when her arms lifted , swirling around her body like liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands lost the air ; her legs kicked uselessly but she kept struggling , all the way to the muddy bottom . The little girl sat at the water 's edge , soaked , chilled , and panting . Several times she swallowed , making a face at the muddy taste in her mouth . The sun had set and there was only a little bit of a red glow left in the sky . She should start back before it was really dark . Mommy had always said it was dangerous to walk on a road after night had fallen , even if you were wearing light-colored clothing . She stood up and looked out over the pond for a long moment . The surface was smooth again . " You got her , " she said quietly . Then , a little louder : " You got her . OK ? That means you do n't need to get me , right ? You said . You did . " She seemed to listen to something , but there was nothing to hear except the nighttime noise of crickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , OK ? " Her face puckered a little . " Well , you better not ! You said ! " The pond lay impassive , not even a ripple disturbing it , promising nothing . Richie turned and ran up to the road .  | This is a story that came out of some recurrent dream imagery . For me , dreaming is rummaging through a grab-bag of odds and ends and figuring out uses for them . Well , after the fact  --  as I 've pointed out elsewhere , I do n't dream lucidly , ever . I never known when I 'm dreaming because everything is equally absurd to me . The boys in the rain in particular seemed no more and no less unreasonable than anything else I 've ever seen . Sometimes I even forget and wonder if they 're still out there every time it rains ... As someone pointed out to me once , life is what happens when you 're making other plans . And if you do n't make other plans , it happen anyway . V  | They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Joe , turning a page in the book he was reading . " Those boys . They 're out in the rain again . " She touched her it finger to the chill window as though to blot the raindrops on the other ; There was a small halo of fog when she took her finger away . " So they 're out in the rain . Some people do n't have sense enough come in out of the rain and there 's the proof . " Delia fidgeted with a button on her baggy sweater . " It 's so sad , tho Seeing them down there in the street like that . " " So do n't look . " She grimaced over her shoulder at him . " Joe , what if they do n't 1 homes to go to ? " Joe shifted position slightly on the couch , bracing his bare feet n firmly against the arm and did n't look up from his book . " They mus somewhere , since they are n't there all the time . " Delia turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the little al ( that stuck out from the rest of the building just enough to give her a vie the whole street . Marks on the woodwork showed where a windowseat once been . When they had taken , but that had 1 a year ago . Now neither of them mentioned it any more . She knew Joe what be against the idea  --  Why give the robbers who own this place free w value ? he 'd say . They wo n't give us a break on the rent and they 'll jack it the hell up on the next people to live here after we leave . The trouble V  | knowing someone really well , she thought , was that ninety percent of any discussions were finished before they were started . " Are you going to stand there and watch those boys all night ? " he asked . " I might . " He sighed noisily but did n't say anything else . Delia pulled the sweater more tightly around her . It was a cold spring this year . Cold and wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sweater or her afghan ( the result of her one burst of artsy-craftsiness in college ) , eating bottles of sinus headache remedy like mints and wading through a vague , free-floating disappointment . The last of the winter blahs , she told herself . Once the weather warmed up , she 'd snap out of it . By contrast , Joe was unaffected by things like weather . He seldom got depressed for any reason and he did n't waste any anxiety on something as far removed from his life as a group of teenaged boys in the rain . She could n't remember exactly when she had first noticed them . It had been some time before the last snow , a half-hearted storm that had turned to rain and then fizzled out . They 'd been down there at the bus stop that night just as they were now , idly hanging around the sign , standing on the curb , sitting on the back of the bench with their feet on the seat and then jumping off again . They were always shifting about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nowhere to go . Delia was uncertain of precisely how many there were . The bench was in the shadow of another building , away from the streetlamps and she could see only their forms when they sat on it . Sometimes they seemed to blend together or divide so that , watching , she would realize she was seeing one when she thought there had been three or two where she 'd thought there 'd been only one . They melted in and out of the darkness , distinct only when they were near the bus stop sign where the streetlamps cut them into the definite shapes of boys . There could n't have been more than eight of them , she decided , and no less than four . Six or seven , then , and she had become so familiar with their postures and movements that she was sure they were the same six or seven every night . Every rainy night  --  they did n't show up on clear nights . Peculiar . Why only rainy nights ? It should have been the other way around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book down . " Do you really intend just to stand there all night ? " She shrugged . " There 's nothing else to do . " " For God 's sake , turn on the TV if you want , read a book or something . " He paused , waiting for her to move away from the window . When she did n't , he said , " If you stay there , they 're going to think you want to invite them up . I 'm sure they 've already noticed you watching them . " " From seven storeys up , they ca n't tell who I am . " PAT CADIGAN V  | " Do n't be so sure . You could he coming home from work some night and find those little bastards have arranged a reception for you . " One of them stumbled and fell off the curb into the gutter . Delia flinched , holding her breath till he got up again , wiping himself off . He limped around the others , exaggerating the movement comically . Just boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can their families be thinking of ? " she said aloud . Joe grunted , got up and put on the radio . " Damnit , will you come away from there ? And do n't complain there 's nothing to do . I offered to take you to a movie earlier . " " It 's Saturday night . All the theaters are packed , " she said over the longingly high voice of a singer who moaned that he 'd been waiting for a girl like her to come into his life . " Big deal . It 's a crowded world and getting more crowded . You ought to be used to it by now . " " Sitting shoulder to shoulder in the dark with a lot of strangers is n't my idea of a good time . " " No , you 'd rather watch strangers hang out in the rain . Honest to God , Delia , you 're turning into some kind of cranky old lady . " " I am not . " She rubbed her arms briskly with irritation and moved away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , watching her as she wandered over to the bookshelf . " You do n't want to go out but you 're restless , are n't you ? " " I do n't know what I am . " " Yeah , you 're restless . And cranky and fussy because of it . " Delia made a face , pulled a book out at random and plumped down on the old green easychair . " And now you 're mad at me . " " I 'm not mad . At anyone . " She opened the book and looked down her nose at it . " Then talk to me . " She rested her head against the back of the chair . " I do n't know what I am , " she said again . " Well , I do . You 're moody as hell is what you are . " He gave her a wry , lopsided smile before he put his feet up and opened his own book again . Disc jockey patter flowed into the gulf between them , filling it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Delia stared at the ceiling . Decades of replastering had made it uneven and lumpy , as though it were the topographical map of some alien terrain turned upsidedown and hanging over their heads . Joe had assured her it would n't fall in ; so far , he 'd been right . She took a deep breath and let it out slowly , feeling herself sink deeper into  --  the last of the winter blahs ? No , it seemed like something else now . She moved her head slightly , so that Joe was in her  | peripheral vision . The lamplight gave his brown hair honey-colored over-tones . Delia and Joe at home , home and dry . Dry . Her gaze roamed over the ceiling again , the book in her lap forgotten . The boys in the rain appeared in her mind 's eye . The street gleamed wetly , reflecting the light from the streetlamps as cold white blobs , making the boys seem more like moving holes of darkness , darker than the darkness swimming before her unblinking eyes . They stood at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gutter , rocking back and forth . Just kids out playing in the rain . How could they stand to be cold and wet for so long ? Was their hair plastered to their head , the rain running down their faces and necks ? Were they chilled to the point of numbness ? In her mental image , the impromptu line suddenly turned and looked up at the window . Now she could almost make out some of their faces , pale as the streetlights , expressionless , anonymous , too hard for children , too unfinished for adults , almost too cold to be human , no adolescent charm , none at all . Washed away in the rain , she thought . The one farthest away from her vanished . He dissolved into the shadows so completely and quickly that she was n't sure he had been there at all . And then the whole waking dream itself dissolved into the white of the ceiling . Delia blinked her watering eyes . " Want to go to bed ? " She looked over at Joe , raising her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were snoring . " " Was I ? " She sighed . Of course he meant go to sleep . " Like a soldier . " He closed the book with a snap . " What do you say ? " " I 'm not really sleepy . " Joe laughed briefly . " Right . I forgot . You do n't know what you are . Maybe there 's something good on the late movie you could sit up and watch , then . I 'll even let you eat potato chips in bed if you want . " She gazed at the empty alcove . From where she was sitting , she could n't see out the window that looked down on the bus stop . If she got up and went to it now , what would the boys be doing ? " Come on . " Joe said . He shut off the radio and pulled her out of the chair . She let him take her to the bedroom and then slipped out of his arm at the doorway . " I want to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the lights in the living room , then . And bring the potato chips back with you . " He began peeling off his clothes casually , letting them drop on the floor . She ran the water in the kitchen and took the potato chips out of the cabinet before she turned off the living room lights . The rain had stopped and the boys were gone . PAT CAI ) IUAN C-. - V  | A crash of thunder awoke her . Rain spattered against the window like sloppy machine gun fire . She sat up in bed , pulling the covers up around herself . In his sleep , Joe tugged at the blankets , rolling over . Delia put a hand on his ribs . His skin was pleasantly warm . Dry . She thought about cuddling up to him and letting his body heat lull her back to sleep . Thunder crashed again , followed by several quick flashes of lightning . She slid out of bed , groping for her bathrobe . Joe began to snore faintly . He could sleep through a thermonuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the floor , she padded barefoot to the living room . Instead of going directly to the window , she sat down on the sofa and listened to the storm . Five years ago , she could not have believed herself capable of sitting in the dark in the middle of the night doing nothing at all . She had never been particularly fond of the dark ; Joe had often teased her about her insistence on turning on the lights as she went from one room to another at night . But waking in the middle of the night was different . It was waking to native country ; to turn on a light now would have been wrong and artificial . Anyway , there was just enough indirect light from the streetlamps for her to see by . She found Joe 's cigarettes in the drawer of one of the endtables and lit one . She 'd quit smoking about a year after they had moved in together . Joe did n't really have a habit . He used cigarettes the way some people had an occasional drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wondered why she could n't be the same . Some people just seemed born to steer themselves through life while others were swept or pushed or carried along , having things happen to them . She admitted she was in the latter group only at this hour of the morning  --  whatever hour it was , two , three , maybe even four a.m . To be merely mortal was out of fashion . These were the days of the goal-directed , the success-oriented , the self-actualized , the strictly disciplined , all appetites and weaknesses controlled , or at least dealt with . All acts were now gotten together , cleaned up , bad habits like cigarettes or cocaine kicked and you were responsible for your own life , you made it happen , you were to thank or to blame for yourself . So she could thank or blame herself for sitting in a dark room in the middle of the night , indulging in a habit she had supposedly given up two years before . She put the cigarette out in the ashtray by the lamp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dim light and shadow . And down in the street ? had the boys returned , now that it was raining again ? Thunder rumbled and the windows rattled in sympathy as lightning flickered . She got up and took three steps toward the alcove and then paused , balancing on the ball of her left foot . Under the sound of a car passing , its tires whispering wetly , came the creak of the mattress springs as Joe turned over . She hurried back to the  | bedroom . If he should have wakened and found her at the window , she would never have heard the end of it . The storm intensified , keeping her from deep sleep . For what might have been hours , she dozed with the image of the rainslick street and the boys appearing and disappearing in her dreams . Sunlight poured through the window over the kitchen sink , flowed across the table and spilled onto the worn linoleum . It seemed thin and pale and out of place . Delia 's eyes watered to look at it . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day that is n't overcast , " she said tiredly to Joe . " Uh-huh , " he said , crackling the newspaper . She paused in the act of lifting her coffee cup . " That 's it . Uh-huh ' ? Not even yes , dear ' ? " He lowered the section of paper he was reading . " That 's uh-huh ' as in you should n't be standing at the window watching strangers hang around the streets . Which you would know if you ever looked at anything beside the funnies . " " I read the movie section , " she mumbled . " Listen to this : The body of a boy , aged sixteen or seventeen , was discovered near the corner of 32nd Street and Bonner Boulevard this morning by a policeman patrolling the area . Officer Clarence Amalfi found the boy face upon the sidewalk , fully-clothed . No evidence of foul play was observable . The body carried no identification . ' He paused and looked over at her . " That 's barely a block away from here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What else does it say ? " " Not much . Speculation that he was a runaway , anyone with information should call the police . Do you see why I do n't want you staring out the window at the goings-on down there on the street ? " She smeared her sleep-mussed hair away from her face without answer-ing . " I 'm not kidding . You could see something and someone could see you seeing it and decide to make sure you did n't say anything about it . " " Maybe I should call the police , " she said , staring through the doorway at the living room . " What ? Why ? " " Because I saw them . The boys in the rain last night . " " So what would you tell them ? That you saw some boys hanging out in the rain last night ? " " Well ... yes . " " Bad idea , Delia . Just telling them there was a group of boys on the street last night is n't providing them with any information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not have been with them in the first place . " " I have a feeling he was . The paper said he was found about ablock away from here ? " " That does n't mean shit , Deals . Stay away from that window from now on . She got up and stomped over to the coffeepot to refill her cup . " Why do n't you just put a bag over my head ? That way I could n't see anything . Or better yet , sew my eyes shut or poke them out altogether . " " I 'm trying to help you , to see that you protect yourself . " " You 're not my father , " she said , pouring a dollop of milk into her coffee . The spoon rang on the porcelain as she stirred it . " You 're not even my husband . " " Not legally , perhaps , but in every other sense I am . " She bit her lower lip so she would n't ask him which of the two relationships she had mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop and think for two seconds , you 'd see I 'm right . " " Look , Joe . I 'm not going to keep away from the window just because I might see something . " " I did n't say that . " Joe rapped the table with his knuckles . " Now you 're twisting what I said because you do n't want to hear it . " " You know how I feel about anyone telling me what to do . " " I 'm not trying to boss you around . I 'm trying to show you that you 've been doing something foolish . " She adjusted her bathrobe , pulling the belt tighter . " I really did n't want to fight with you today . " Joe spread his hands . " Then do n't . " " All right . I wo n't . " She gulped down half her coffee and dashed the rest in the sink . " I 'm going to take a shower . " The memory of the daydream or waking dream of whatever it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved languidly through the day . She had visualized one of the boys disappearing from the group . Had he reappeared a block away , face up on the pavement , dead ? She had not visualized that . But then , the boy had disappeared on his own in the dream , not because she 'd willed it . She and Joe made a half-hearted peace in which the subject of her window vigils was dropped unresolved . Conversation between them dried up . When Joe suggested a matinee , she agreed to it neutrally as an opportunity for them to get away from each other while being together . They sat side by side in the dark theater , reprieved from their relationship for two hours and when they emerged , blinking , into the fading day , the sun had vanished behind low-hanging , gray clouds . " It 'll rain like a bastard tonight , " someone walking out behind them ? I ) I IL ' I ' Y W ( I It . K  | said . " It 's just not going to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the car . ' By dark , it was pouring . On the couch , Joe snored softly , his ever-present book fallen open face down on his chest . Delia watched him sleep , knowing that when he woke up , he would be annoyed with her for not rousing him . Too bad . She was n't actually angry with him any more . He could n't understand her all the time any more than she could wake him up every time he dozed off before bedtime . They 'd been together for almost three years , unmarried because of the tax penalty of the legal state of wedlock , which they 'd both agreed was ridiculous and unfair . Almost three years . Had their relationship been a person , it would be well into the toddler stage , still developing , very troublesome . She wondered if a relationship could be reduced to those terms . Sometimes it did feel as though they had some sort of young , unwieldily creature between them that they were struggling to tame or something . Or maybe she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did every so often . Joe twitched in his sleep . The sheer familiarity of him was suddenly huge in her mind , like a balloon that had abruptly inflated in a small , enclosed area . She backed away a step . Thunder rumbled mutedly , gently , it seemed to her , almost as if to remind her that it was still raining . She had been conscientiously staying away from the windows tonight , not so much as an outward sign to Joe that she was heeding his advice but on the pretense of disinterest . Now with Joe asleep on the sofa in all his concentrated familiarity , she went to the alcove and pulled back the filmy curtain . They were there , as always ; loitering , shifting , waiting . The wet street gleamed . She could hear the patter of the rain on the pavement , at first faint and steady , then gradually increasing in volume and tempo , like a monotonous yet urgent drum roll . It seemed to agitate the boys , to stir them up somehow . She still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew there was one less than there had been . She was sure of it . She caught the movement in the shadows of a boy leaping from the bus stop bench into the midst of the others , who were milling around closer to the curb . In another moment , she thought , they would look up at the window , at her . She pushed herself away , ducking behind the wall . Let them look now . All they would see was an empty , lighted window . Maybe it would remind them they could be somewhere else than out in the cold and damp . Joe mumbled something in his sleep . She fled to the kitchen and ran the water . At the last moment , she decided to call in sick to work the next morning . She sat on the edge of the bed with one shoe on and the other in her lap , PAT CADIGAN - V  | watching Joe dress . I le disapproved of that sort of thing , calling in sick when you were n't on your deathbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He only finished dressing and went into the kitchen for a quick cup of coffee . Perhaps he was willing to allow her the need of a mental health day now and then . She listened to the sounds he made , the gurgle of the coffee as he poured , the tap of the cup when he set it down between gulps . The newspaper rustled as he leafed through it and then pushed it aside . After work , he would give it a thorough reading . What must it be like to be Joe , she wondered suddenly  --  to be so busy with the world , her included ? His life was utterly directed ; he was like a motorboat , cutting deliberately through the water to some firm destination , while she was more like a waterskiier that had latched on behind at the dock , moving in wide arcs behind him as he towed her along . Jesus , how had she gotten so . . . undirected , unmotivated just plain un ? " What happened to me ? " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empty apartment . Joe had left for work without her even hearing the door shut . She looked down at the shoe in her lap . One moment she 'd been listening to every trivial sound he was making , the next she 'd faded out completely , as though she 'd been the one who 'd left instead of Joe . She tossed the shoe away , kicked off the other one and changed out of her acceptable product-management dress-for-success suit into her oldest jeans and sweatshirt . All right , what did she do next , call in a SWAT team from NOW ? Hello , Women 's Movement ? This is Delia LeBlanc and somehow I have become unstuck from modern living .

Are you under the mistaken impression that I 'm the only one ? Do you really think that people do n't slip through the chinks into limbo on a regular basis ? Have you never said : Whatever became of So-and-So , you know who I mean , the name escapes me and I only vaguely remember the face ... What was the number of the Existential Crisis Line ?

Five minutes since Joe had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighth of a teaspoon at a time . Sun and clouds fought for the day and the sun conceded just after noon . Delia lay on the couch , pinned to the cushions by a combination of inertia and aching sinuses , a carefully-made sandwich of cheese , lettuce , and tomato on seven-grain lying untouched on a plate on the floor . She had unread several current magazines and unstarted a book Joe had finished last week and recommended to her . She would n't even fade out , she thought tiredly . She 'd simply become more and more inert until she devolved into a speed-bump on the highway of life . Joe 's life . She had an unlife . She would call him . Right now . She 'd get up and call him and tell him she needed help . He 'd come home and together they 'd figure out what to do . Professional help , maybe , or something just as simple as signing up for a course in something unusual at the university . Or dinner out and a movie . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like out-of-date Alka Seltzer in standing water . Whatever became of .. ? Delia ? Oh , her shelf-life expired , such an unshame . She closed her eyes and pretended to sleep . Sometime later , she pretended to visualize the view from the window overlooking the bus stop . The boys capered in the wet and the dark , one less than they had been ( however many there were ) , and she knew they were aware she was watching , they 'd been aware all along and they 'd been holding her , their aimless movements actually an arcane little raindance meant to mesmerize as it wove a pattern that worked only on someone who had receded far enough , so far that ... Joe shook her arm once and then twice , so she pretended to wake up . " It 's the weather , " Joe said . " They say it 's a cycle of tropical storms affecting the northern latitudes , happens every few years . Everyone 's walking around with their eyes glazed and their mouths hanging open . But it ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like a new person . Trust me . " She did trust him , Delia thought . Her unlife was completely in his hands , or had been until it had started slipping through his fingers . What would happen when he discovered she was a failed human being ? Or , rather , what would unhappen ? She got up from the easy chair and went to the window , peering through the dribbles of rain . " All right , " Joe said after a long pause . " Have it your way . Do n't do anything , do n't be anything . I saw you had that book out . You did n't read it , though , did you ? " PAT CADIGAN hi V  | " No , " she said in a small voice . The boys were showily keeping their hacks to her ; she could tell by the way their silhouettes bent and dipped against the faint shine of the wet pavement . " All right , " he said again . " There 's nothing I can do for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Deals . No one can pull you out of this until you reach out . I 've thrown you a rope several times but you 've refused to grab onto it . " The boys made a momentary tableau around the bench , like a dance troupe pausing at a rest in the music . Lightning strobed silently ; their face were turned upward to the window now and she caught a glimpse of the rain beaded on their colorless cheeks . " It 's not refusal , Joe . It 's paralysis . " He did n't answer . It took her a long time to turn around and see that he had , absurdly , fallen asleep , his ever-present book tented over his crotch . Delia pressed her hands against her mouth . Locked out . She could n't get back in now if she tried with all her strength . The rain made white noise against the windows , on the street . No . She straightened up , throwing off the afghan she 'd wrapped around her shoulders . No , she would not accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of un . She would fight her way back in if it meant she had to die in the attempt . But she would die real . Yo , melodrama ! That 's right , you wan na make something of it ? She went to the closet by the front door and yanked out the first coat she touched , an old Army surplus jacket of Joe 's that they 'd been hanging onto for no reason except inertia . Well , the age of inertia was over , she thought as she thrust herself into it . She 'd use it and anything else , she 'd use everything usable and anything unusable would go out in the trash . She paused in the half-open door and looked back at Joe . His breathing was heavy but soft , not quite a snore . Then she stomped out . Afire with resolve , she marched down seven flights of stairs rather than waiting for the elevator , strode through the empty lobby and pushed stiffarmed out the security door . The rain , in ultimate anti-climax , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , catching her breath . They only came out in the rain ; they were gone now . And just what had she thought she was going to accomplish anyway ? Confront them and do what ? Order them off her turf and forbid them ever to return to steal her soul ?

The only un we are going to experience is that of going uncrazy . She reached around the corner , hesitated , and forced herself to step off the curb and cross the street , watching the bench and the bus stop sign grow larger as she approached . Behind her , she could almost feel the lighted rectangle of the living room window seven stories up . Trained on her like a gunsight , the dividers between the panes acting as the crosshairs . Except now there was no one to look through it . She crossed the street forever and reached the other side with her heart laboring in her chest . The bench was empty , the narrow wooden slats wet and cold . Sit down on it and you 'd be soaked through . She touched the back , holding the jacket closed with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for bus stops , nothing out of the ordinary . But the bench had never been in dispute , had it ? She was in the act of turning around to go back when the rain suddenly started again , falling straight down . And they were there , all around her as if they 'd been there the whole time . The rain beat on the pavement but it seemed to be caressing her , accommodating her form , sliding through her hair , along her skin and down into her clothes , smoothing as it went until it collected in low center and then rolled on , down her legs . Their faces were visible and yet no clearer . Anonymous ; unfaces . But even an unface could fade even further away , if there was another ready to displace it . Face up on the pavement with puddles in the eyes , no identification , no outward signs of foul play . And what happened after that ? Nothing much . Nothing at all . They stood with her as the rain did its work . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bony smoothness of her chest , a few drops rolling awkwardly from the freshly-formed Adam 's apple , down adolescent stomach and narrow hips into unused , unalive masculinity .

He called his When The Music 's Over ( as distinguished from the like-minded There Wo n't Be War , edited by Harry Harrison and Bruce McAllister ) , though the theme , he told me , had to do with any kind of violence , not just standard war . Fortunate for me  --  I do n't know a thing about being in the Armed Forces or what it 's like to serve in combat . But I saw a few of the best minds of my generation ( to phrase a coin ) scarred at the sight of their mothers ' black eyes and broken jaws , and later locked up in juvenile hall on the allpurpose stubborn-child charge when fists and belts were no longer enough to keep them in line . So if there 's anything I 'm in favor of avoiding , it 's violence .

In my family , we 're built to take it . If she 'd been conscious , my mother probably would have made a Timex joke about it herself . Great sense of humor , my mother . Of course , she would n't have found it too funny if she 'd known I 'd taken the Timex off and flung it as hard as I could into the darkness of Comanche Park . With any luck , she 'd be too distracted to think about it after she woke up . I had n't wanted the Timex and I did n't need it to know that it was after midnight now , so it was n't my birthday any more . Actually , I was thinking mostly about Jonas as I sat in the dimly-lit hospital room . I wished he 'd change his mind and come in even just for a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would have accomplished ; Mom was asleep , sedated-asleep , and I would n't have been able to rouse her even if I 'd wanted to . And it probably would n't have been so great for Jonas to see her like this , but considering what-all-else he 'd seen tonight and other nights , I could n't see where it would be especially harmful , either . I knew what my mother would have said about it . She 'd have told me to stop moping around in a hospital room and go see to my little brother ? she was taken care of , whereas he was probably down in the solarium watching god-knew-what on TV . Get him out of there , Jan , she 'd say , get him to bed and make sure he gets off to school all right , I 'll be home by the time school lets out tomorrow afternoon .

She did n't exactly smile at me but it was a friendly type of look . She knew us ; she 'd been on duty some of the other times . I knew what she wanted and I did n't want to discuss it around my mother 's inert body , so I got up and went out into the hall with her . " Does your mother still have the number for the shelter ? " she asked me quietly . I shrugged . " I can give it to you , then . You and Jonas could go there now . I 'm sure they have space for you at least for tonight . " " Thanks , " I said , " but I just do n't get a good night 's sleep unless I 'm in my own bed . " My mother used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she could talk .

" ' Jonas had fallen asleep in front of the TV in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the screen but no sound . I shook him awake and herded him out of there . The nurse had gone back down to the ER , fortunately , but we had to pass through there to get out , and I had to stop and use the pay phone to call a cab . I always remember to get cab fare out of the stash I 'm not supposed to know is in the old flour canister . Things were mostly pretty quiet  --  people do n't routinely come into suburban hospitals in the middle of the night with gunshot wounds or from car accidents  --  and I was glad , because there 's always a wait for a cab . I 'd just hung up the phone when suddenly this kid was brought in , a toddler , really , screaming his lungs out . The sound went right through me ? the kid was obviously in agony and I thought my hair must have been standing straight up . I could feel the tension level shoot skyhigh in the ER ; suddenly there were half a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been an intern or a resident or something clustered around this woman with this screaming , thrashing child in her arms . The woman looked pale and scared but still kind of cool , like she was just holding off on a nervous breakdown until she was in a safe place . Right behind her was a guy who had to be her husband ; he 'd thrown a pair of jeans on over his pajamas . The shirt was half-untucked , and you could see the bottoms of the cuffs poking out from the jeans over his bedroom slippers . He looked dazed , like he was just now waking up . I could n't move . I stood there hanging onto the telephone , listening to the kid scream and scream . The doctor took them behind a curtain and the kid kept on screaming like they were killing him and everybody was talking at once , trying to calm the kid down and tell the doctor what was wrong . Right about the time I thought I was going to lose it and start screaming myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounding super-calm and super-competent , the way you want a doctor 's voice to sound . " That 's a nasty ear infection , but they 're all nasty at this age . I do n't see a rupture . " His voice changed as he started talking to the kid . " A lot of real hurty stuff , huh , big guy . Yeah . Do n't you worry , we 're gon na put in some medicine and you 're gon na feel all better . Mommy , you hold his arms  --  like that  --  okay , big guy , I 'll make this as fast as I can ? " The kid 's screams began to sound more indignant than anything else . I looked for Jonas . He was standing a little ways away with his backup against the wall and his arms crossed over his chest with his hands stuck in his armpits , like if he let go he 'd fall apart . He was n't looking toward the kid but just staring off at nothing in another direction . " Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cab outside . It 's not cold . " 170 I ) IIi.WU11.K  | I put my hand on his shoulder to steer him out and he twisted away from me , still holding himself . The little kid stopped screaming as we got to the door and I turned around to look back . The nurse who had come up to see me was standing by the curtain , making notes on a clipboard . I moved us out before she could look up and see us . But the image of her standing there kind of hung in my mind all the way home and I began to get the idea she 'd known we were there even though she had n't looked . The house was all lit up when we got home but my father was gone , which meant we were locked out . Or we would have been , except Jonas shinnied up the drainpipe and did a high-wire act without a net  --  without a wire , for that matter  --  to clamber into his open bedroom window . Every time he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see the drainpipe suddenly ripping away from the house and crashing down , hitting the neighbors ' fence and dumping him on his head in their shrubbery . This time , I heard the drainpipe bend a little as he was stretching over to the little ledge outside his window , to work the screen up with the toe of his sneaker . Eventually , he was going to be too big , too heavy for the drainpipe to hold him . Maybe in another few weeks or months , too ; he was eleven . He got the screen up a few inches and then it stuck . Working quietly in the light from the streetlamp , he changed position so he could reach over and pound the bottom of the screen up with his hand . It went up a little more , enough for him to get his legs in so he could sit precariously on the windowsill . " Slide in , " I whispered up at him , looking around . We were a neighborhood watch area and I could picture a patrol car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrest us for breaking and entering . But then I figured if no one had called the cops earlier , no one was going to call now . Jonas could n't seem to get his little butt , skinny as it was , through the window , and he kept sitting there , balancing mostly on his thighs and hanging on with one hand while he pounded the screen with the other . Then he stopped and I could n't tell what he was doing . A moment later , I heard this sort of ripping , and the sound of metal bending and scraping against something , and I saw he 'd torn out the screen and pulled the aluminum frame all out of shape . I did n't rag him for it ; I knew just how he felt . He got in and a moment later the ruined screen came down into the yard . Jonas poked his head out . " That did n't hit you , did it ? " " Nah , just let me in so we can get some sleep , okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of keys made , I thought , as I locked the front door behind me . No , two sets  --  one to hide around the outside of the house somewhere in case I lost the extra set somehow . They told us not to do that at the neighborhood watch meeting , because experienced burglars know all PAT CADIGAN Ill V  | the hiding places . But I decided I could he smarter than a burglar when it came to hiding keys . Dad did n't have to know . Mom , either . I cleaned up the mess in the kitchen . The turkey really stunk after being left so long and the smell lingered . I 'd have had to wash the floor thoroughly with the mop and the Mr. Clean and the whole bit to get rid of it and I just was n't up to anything more than sopping up the worst of the grease and blood and junk with paper towels . The living room was a bigger problem ; the coffee table looked like we 'd started to chop it up for kindling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table and from my mother 's favorite Klee print . The print was over in the corner by the brass floorlamp . The frame was done for but I thought the print might be salvageable . It was a little creased in spots but I could try ironing it , on the back . There was still the problem of the glass all over . Thank God we did n't have pets or a toddler ; thank God neither Jonas nor I brought friends home from school . The vacuum cleaner was broken again , so getting all the shards out of the fiber was going to be one hell of a job . " One motherfucker of a job , " I said out loud , but very quietly , as if there might have been someone around to hear me talk like that . I never talked like that , and I would n't let Jonas get away with it , though mostly I could n't see the harm in it if you needed to blow off some . Anyway , I sure could n't start combing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , but Jonas might get up early and wander into the living room before he was completely awake . Then we 'd be back in the emergency room maybe having to get stitches in his foot , or even both feet . I took a roll of toilet paper from the bathroom and roped the living room off with it , sticking the ends of the long piece up on the woodwork of the entryway with masking tape . Then I took a piece of blank stationery from the little desk in the hall by the stairs and wrote DANGER FALLING GLASS AREA and stuck that up on the toilet paper . I was just about to go upstairs when I saw I 'd left the light on in the kitchen . I went back in to shut it off and then I saw it on the counter by the sink , almost completely untouched , except for where a little turkey grease had splattered on it . The chocolate sheet cake my mother and Jonas had made and decorated together . Chocolate cake with strawberry-flavored pink icing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were supposed to be flowers or something in the corners ; the lettering was unmistakably Jonas 's hand . RAD B-DAY TO U. I put foil over the cake and tossed the unused candles in the junk drawer . The sound of the front door roused me out of the light doze I 'd fallen into 17l I ) IItTY WORK V  | and I rolled over and glanced at the clock . 2:12 . Not a personal record , even for a week night . I had no idea where he went when he left , or what he did . Maybe he just drove around . He was n't drunk , anyway . I could tell by his footsteps . They were sure and even and they cut off suddenly as he got to the living room entryway . " What the hell is this ? " I heard him mutter . I could hear him quite clearly , probably because the house was so quiet . His voice seemed to vibrate up through the floor to me . Then : " Stupid shit . Looks like hell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the paper barrier and crumpled my sign . A few moments later , I heard the tinkle of broken glass and a grunt , and then footsteps going through the kitchen to the back door . Getting rid of the ruins of the coffee table . Right . The cleaning lady was coming tomorrow ? excuse me , today . Could n't let her see that . Might give her the idea something bad happened . I wondered if he 'd actually clean up the worst of the glass , too , or whether he 'd leave it to me to tell her a story . Giselle had heard so many stories . It sounded like he got rid of most of the glass before he shut himself up in his den at the bottom of the stairs . On the bad nights , he slept on the couch down there . At first , I 'd thought it was because he was actually ashamed , at least temporarily , and it was his way of punishing himself or something , but as I got older , I stopped thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him move around for twenty minutes ; then I got up , slipped into my clothes and tiptoed downstairs . He 'd left all the lights on , like it had n't occurred to him to shut them off . I did n't bother , either . I just left by the back door for the park . Comanche Park was this weird little pocket of wild in the middle of hard-core suburbia . There was a covered picnic-table area and a few barbecue grills , a small playground for the kids , and the storm drain where Jonas and his friends rode skateboards . Back behind the clearing was the woods , a remnant of what the area used to be like before the developers moved in and made things safe for people who kept boats in their driveways . There were a few trails stomped out , and if you followed the main ones , you came out on the other side facing the Maple Creek development cul-desac and the tennis courts . But there were wilder , thicker , darker places where the police never patrolled and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess ; occasionally , I 'd found an empty whisky bottle , or some discarded piece of clothing . It always made me picture some ragged old bum finishing off a bottle and saying to himself , well , what the hell , I guess I 'll leave my shirt here . I did n't go into any of those places at night , but I did n't have to . The sign said the park was closed after ten pm , but there was no gate to close , no chain to put up , nothing to stop me from going in and very little light to hold the PAT CADIGAN 173 V  | darkness back in the thick of the trees where it stayed during the day . There were three swings on the rough wooden frame in the playground area , one for infants and two sling-type things . I sat on the one nearest the woods and let myself drift back and forth , watching the darkness creep . The fight had started early . This was the Birthday Fight . My parents fought any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special . Birthdays were a must . I 'd been up in my room not doing my homework when the shouting had begun . The sound went right through me ; I sat there at my desk and it seemed like I could feel Jonas doing the same thing in his room , just frozen wherever he was , listening to it start . I went downstairs and they were in the living room , yelling things at each other , as if they had to yell to make themselves heard over the aroma of the turkey roasting in the oven . I do n't know what they were fighting over exactly , not the surface issue , so to speak . The actual issue was , of course , my birthday . Jonas appeared at the top of the stairs as I opened the front door . I did n't have to beckon to him . He just came down quickly and we went out to the park . It was only starting to get dark then , but there was n't anyone else around . Jonas and I sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to take him on long , long walks when he 'd been younger and did n't know what was going on . Now we went over to Comanche Park and sat it out . I threw my watch at the woods just before we left . There was no one and nothing else to take it out on . Everything was quiet when we got back ; my mother was in the kitchen , carving the turkey and sniffing , with her eyes all red . My father was sitting at the table with his chin on his fists , staring at the placemat . Jonas and I sat down and there was only the sound of my mother sniffing and the smell of turkey . Then my mother turned around . My father 's right hand had come up and smashed the platter of turkey out of her grasp . She had screamed something at him , or maybe she 'd just been startled , and as she 'd moved toward the mess of white meat and drumsticks and gravy on the floor , he 'd gotten up out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulder blades , so she 'd gone face-first into the lower kitchen cabinets . She 'd started scrambling to get up and it had been like some kind of real mean slapstick movie clip the way her feet kept slipping on the turkey , pieces of it skidding all over the linoleum in every direction . Jonas and I started to get up , get away from the table and Dad had gone over to Mom and pulled her up by the back of her shirt , jerked her around to face him , and let fly backhanded . Like he was swatting her . That had been when her teeth had gone through her lip . She 'd been on her way down to the floor again when his fist had caught her in the stomach . The punch had lifted her off her feet a few inches . He 'd stepped back to let her 1 ( 4 DIRTY WORK V  | fall then . She hit my chair going down and tipped it over . Jonas and I were backed up against the refrigerator . Dad stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get to the table . With one arm across her stomach , she half-stumbled , half-lunged around the other side of the table , going past me and Jonas . Dad watched until she got to the hall and then he walked out after her . She made a gagging noise and I heard the phone fall on the carpet . Jonas ran for the living room and I ran after him to pull him back ; I got to the entryway just as Dad brought the Klee down on her back . He flipped it away like a frisbee and as she reached out for him , he grabbed the front of her shirt and shoved her down on the coffee table . He had to pull her up and shove her down again before it broke . Dad turned away unhurriedly and his gaze passed through us without stopping as he walked out of the room and out the front door . He had n't looked crazy or dangerous or even particularly angry . More like he 'd just broken something and was going in search of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was going to do and I said I did n't know , which I did n't . From where I was sitting on the swing , I could look back the way I 'd come , through the parking lot and across Fall Avenue to our street . Our house was the third from the corner of Fall , easy to pick out now since it was the only one showing any lights . Tonight 's episode must have been pretty audible ; I could probably have sat right where I was now and heard the glass breaking . Every other house looked peaceful , unaffected in any way . Which they were , as far as I could tell , something that made me feel funny . Not because I thought anyone should have called the cops and sent them to our rescue  --  mine and Jonas ' s , anyway  --  but because it felt like as long it was happening at our house , everyone else was safe from it happening at theirs . Like we were the designated house for this . So , the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could ? Good question , I told the darkness . I thought about the DiMarias , on our left . The window of my room looked right down into their living room , and I could see their two little kids playing on the rug every night . It looked like a collision between a magazine stand and a toy store in there  --  the DiMarias were not real concerned with being neat , but then , both of them worked and their kids were in daycare . I guess they figured they had better things to do than housework and not enough left over for maid service . I tried to picture Carl DiMaria losing it in that cluttered house with their kids playing on the rug and Sheila trying to get away from him , and I turned that movie off quick , I can tell you . The Changs , on the other side , were about as unimaginable , in a different way . They 'd only been in the house six months or so ; Mr. Chang was some kind of engineer with a communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little older than my parents , with one son in college PAT CAIIGAN II V  | somewhere in the cast . I hardly knew them but they had nice smiles , and they moved around each ether the way you see people moving around fragile vases . The Changs seemed about as likely to shout at each other as the sun was to rise in the west . Directly across from us were the Shapiros . They were older people and Mrs. Shapiro took care of her grandson two or three days a week for her daughter , who was divorced or something . I saw Mrs. Shapiro in the park a lot with the kid . She was a pretty sturdy woman , strong enough to keep up with her grandson , who was always trying to climb to the top of the wooden blockhouse , but she did n't look like she was really built to take it . The Foleys , on the corner ; they had dogs instead of kids . Across from them , in the smallest house on the block , Lisa What's-Her-Name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , I thought , idly . She could break up with a boyfriend if there was trouble . Could n't she ? The darkness said it was n't that simple . I ran through everyone else I knew and several I did n't know but had seen at one time or another . No , I told the darkness , there was n't anybody who could be the fighting house instead of us . It was just a weird game I played with myself . I guess you could call it Who Would You Wish Your Life On ? or something like that . Or maybe , Why Me ? I got up and wandered around the playground area , just to be moving around . Trying to pick up some momentum I could use to make myself walk home . The way the air had cooled down , I could tell it was later than I 'd ever been out . School was going to be impossible , might as well not even bother . By the time I decided that , I 'd wandered over to the covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since then , someone had stopped for a beer and left the can half-crumpled on one of the long tables . High up , the trees whispered in the night breeze and the darkness flowed up from the woods in deeper , thicker waves . Your eyes play tricks like that on you when you 're overtired , I thought , and waited for the dark patches to break up on the grass near the covered area and reassemble in the woods . But they kept coming , and I started thinking that maybe I was seeing animals , but then they were too big to be any animals that could live in the park , too big even for people . I wanted to turn and run , but the darkness reached the edge of the covered area and stopped , as if it were waiting . I could n't see a thing ; I groped my way along one of the tables and the darkness flowed around the covered area like a curtain , shutting me in . I sat down , hugging myself against a cold I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably because I was so out of it from needing sleep , but I was n't sleepy , either . I was just there , in the dark , totally in the dark , and  | then I heard Jonas say , " Jan ' ? " " What are you doing out here in the park ' ? " I Whispered . Like someone was going to hear us , right ? " I 'm not in the park , " he said . " I 'm in the dark , same as you . Where we 've always been . " I looked around but I still could n't see anything . And then , unbidden , the sight of my mother in the hospital bed rose up in my mind . I could see her as clearly as if I were back there with her , the tube in her nose , the IV , the stitches , and , beneath her closed lids , her eyes moving back and forth , back and forth . I 'm dreaming , I thought . I 'm dreaming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , said the darkness . " Sometimes , you can do things , " Jonas said . He sounded real young and real old all at the same time . His voice would be changing soon , and the drainpipe would n't hold him much longer , I thought . " Sometimes , when everything 's right , you can  --  urn , do things . " " Where are you ? " " I told you , same place you are , " he said tiredly . " Hurry up . This is n't gon na last forever , you know . " He 's eleven years old , I told the darkness . He 's just eleven years old , it is n't fair There were no words  --  there never had been , really  --  but now I could feel what was being directed at me and how it had been there all along , flicking at the fringes of what I knew as real divided from unreal . That was a smaller issue than I 'd thought ; after all , what was real in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our block . Which made me wonder , then : did someone else , sitting in the dark somewhere , wish this on me ? No , said the darkness , this was always yours . But sometimes , when the conditions are right ... when an offering has been made ... I saw myself flinging my watch at the darkest part of the woods , and I could see how it was an action that had been part of this really convoluted arrangement of things that could have happened  --  like , there was another part of the same thing where I was a lot older and I hit somebody , and sometime else when I was n't much older and somebody hit me , and some other things . But I 'd thrown the watch , because there was n't anyone or anything else to take it all out on . Just a little offering at the right moment . And I was thinking then that there was something in my dad that had come out of the darkness , but right as soon as I thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other way around altogether . So ... what , then ? Fix it , said the darkness . PAT CADIGAN 177 V  | Picture of myself at school , just before final exams and suddenly all the test answers dropping into my lap out of nowhere . I should be so lucky , I thought , but it was like that . Putting in the fix . So few of us , you know , are smart enough or lucky enough to be able to resist something like that , to not need it . Especially if you know something bad 'll happen to you unless you go for it . " Mom wo n't do anything , " Jonas said hollowly . " You wo n't do anything . I ca n't do anything . What am I gon na do  --  go to a shelter all by myself and ask if maybe I could be an honorary battered woman ? That 'd be pretty cool , right ? " " What do you want me to do ? " I said . I knew , though , and Jonas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Put it on somebody else . Let somebody else be in the line of fire , let somebody else take it . It 's us as much as Mom . Someday you 'll be where Mom is . And someday ? " He cut off , but I heard him . Someday , I 'll be like Dad . Shitty thing to have to know about yourself . " That 's an awful lot of return to get just for one watch , " I said , laughing a little . I 'm not sure why I was laughing , nothing was funny . " One little birthday watch . " So , Rad B-day to U. Here was the deal . Better anyone else than us , right ? Or would I really let things go on , let Mom keep a tube in her nose so the DiMaria kids would n't have to grow up like we did , so Mrs. Chang would n't have to have a tube in her nose ? So Mrs. Shapiro 's daughter would n't have to ride in the ambulance with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not with that strange blank look but smiling or looking sad or being like just a regular person , and my mother not telling stories about how she was accident prone , and Jonas and me not waiting for the storm to burst . I could see it all , and I wanted it more than anything . What the hell , if it 's going to have to happen anyway , let it happen to someone else . But the thing was , when it did , we were n't going to call the cops , either . Nobody ever would . Neighborhood watch area  --  we only call the cops on strangers , suspicious persons lurking about , not the people we live with . And if I thought I was going to do it , I was wrong , because that was part of the deal . I did n't have to do anything , and the person I would be after the deal was made would n't want to . And I heard myself say , just as plain as anything , " I ca n't live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened then , but I opened my eyes and it was n't dark any more , and my father was coming across the park with a grim look on his face while behind him on Fall , the early morning traffic was just starting to pick up . He jerked me up away from the table and said , " What the El DIRTY WIIRK V  | hell is this ' ? What do you think you 're doing ? " I looked past him and saw Jonas standing on the corner across the street , like he 'd been abandoned . " Does n't your mother make things bad enough ? " my father asked . " You wan na get raped and murdered in the park , too ? " I twisted away from him and walked away , back through the park and across the street to Jonas , who was glaring at me like I was a traitor . Dad was following after us as I marched Jonas toward the house . " Take your schoolbooks like you 're going to school as usual , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go up to the hospital , and we 'll wait in Mom 's room , until this nurse I know comes on duty . " " What good 'll that do ? " Jonas asked bitterly , not looking up . " She knows how to get us some help . " Jonas glanced briefly back at Dad , who was gaining on us . " Is it gon na be enough help ? What if he finds us and kills Mom , kills us all ? " " We 're not killed yet . You wanted me to do something , I 'm doing it . It 's not so late that we have to make deals with  --  with whatever that is . " " You coulda , " he said , and it was an accusation . " You coulda stopped it , it would be over . " " No , " I told him . " It ca n't be over until you say , I wo n't ' , not anyone else but me . ' " You coulda fixed me , though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Dad again , who was almost caught up with us now . " Sony , " I said , grabbing his hand . " You 'll have to do that one all on your own . Just like me . Just like everybody . " We broke into a run .  | In the early days of glasnost and perestroika , I wondered if this might be the beginning of a period in which Russia and the United States began to change into each other . This was the mid-1980s , after all , a time in which we were facing the possibility of losing a lot of freedom ( any freedom lost is too much ) due to the bizarre combination of a governmentsanctioned religious right wing and the overzealous forces of Political Correctness . Frankly , if we allow ourselves to be imprisoned , it wo n't matter much who the warden is or how well-intentioned  --  jail is jail . And yet the human condition seems to comprise two states : trying to put ourselves in jail , and trying to break ourselves out of jail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves by finding a more agreeable form of bondage . Is that what freedom really is ? It will become obvious to you before the end of the first page that this was written before the latest Russian Revolution , so think of it as alternative reality . Or maybe that should be artificial alternative reality ...  | here was nothing for me to do in Moscow but drink . Well , that and look for Johnny , and I no longer really had to do that . r Sense told me he was in the city , eventually our paths would cross and would reel him in . But until that happened , I had to do something ; drinking was it . Bars as Westerners know them were still relatively nev Moscow . Most of them little more than empty storefronts with the b essentials ; if you wanted atmosphere , you brought it with you . Or , if were an especially wealthy tourist , you could go to one of the head parlors , where they gave you a happy-hood and a couple of gloves so could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night  --  provided , of course , you 'd made your reservation the requi six-to-eight months in advance . I figured it was artificial reality either way and , not being an especially wealthy tourist , I opted for the austerity plan . Besides , in Moscow , it was booze that carried importance , not the place where you drank it , and S seemed to have a deeper understanding of the drinking organism . It certai understood me  --  besides being mellow and friendly , it had the salut effect of enhancing the Sense . The bad news was that sobering up dulled i but that was easy enough to take care of . So there I was , boozing and cruising in Moscow . They all envied back home  --  my turn to fetch Johnny and I got to go to Russia to do it . F time I 'd ever been off the North American continent , too . But here 's a li Home Truth for you ( and why not Home Truth , seeing as how we 've had Awful Truth , Nothing But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each V I DIRTY WORK  | every one ) : one place is pretty much like another , and once I understood what I could do in Moscow , I might have been . anywhere , the language difference notwithstanding . Even now  --  or maybe especially now , in the last weeks before the millennium turned . Well , not a full turn  --  next year would be the real first year of the new millennium , but everyone in the world seemed to be stuck on the idea that 2000 was the Big year . Certain ideas died hard , and others would n't die at all . Like Johnny 's ideas . He could live a thousand years himself and never give up on those sweet , mad ideas . Master of my fate , captain of my soul , world full of miracles , tomorrow 's another day ( or another millennium ) , anything can happen and it probably will . Yah . Dream about it , Johnny . He 'd be doing that right now , somewhere in Moscow , living in his own brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I held my place at a bar that had once been some kind of counter  --  kitchen ? grocery ? ? it was hard to tell in this light ? in another dingy ex-storefront . As usual , there were lots of foreigners . Some were tourists and business travellers , but a good many of them were what the government was calling temporary long-term . ' No doubt plenty of those were skating along on forged papers , hoping to find some way to establish residency later . Russia had been through a lot of changes in the 90s right along with the rest of the world , but people themselves never really change , no matter where they are . Nor do situations . That 's some more Home Truth , and you could figure that one out even without the Sense . So I maintained , anyway . The Sense is not one hundred percent infallible but the group back home believed it was a constant , all-over advantage . I was of two minds , you should pardon the expression , about that , myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's periodic coop flying . Loyal opposition ' is not an easy concept to put over to organisms like us , but we all understood disloyal opposition . We had Johnny . Or we would when I brought him home again , tired , disillusioned , and hung-over from his freedom bender , to play docile prodigal and rejoin . Until all those sweet , mad ideas built up enough to set him off again . I was on my third Stoli , watching the bartender sort out orders and make change , when the front door opened wide with a blast of frigid winter air . Over the multi-lingual gabble , someone started calling for papers in six different languages , and the person on my left dropped like a stone . I looked down . A pretty , heart-shaped face framed by dark blonde hair looked back up at me , eyes wide . " Pamageeteh menye , " she whispered . Help me . I was on the verge of telling her I was n't Russian . Then I moved so that I was standing directly in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | her . She had been at the end of the bar next to the wall , so perhaps no one had seen her duck . Even if someone had , this was n't the type of crowd that would alert the immigration officers now moving through the place and shining flashlights on documents held up for inspection . Chatter became hushed and most movement ceased , except for the sweep of the flashlight beams standing out hard in the smoky air , like lightswords in some old science fiction movie . The bartender moved slowly down the counter , picking up empty glasses , running a rag over the chipped formica , until he came to where I was standing . Folding his arms , he leaned against the wall and looked around in an aimless , bored way before letting his gaze rest pointedly to my left . I showed him my passport and shrugged . He made a fist , wincing . His thoughts were like a bellow in my skull , a mostly incoherent expression of anger , at me with my coat so obviously spread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers , at the world in general for interfering with him . He was very young , one of the post-glasnost generation , with no memory of a different time , when this empty storefront would have been equally empty even with a store in it , when he might have begged the blonde 's blue jeans from her to sell on the black market and ended up crouching in the dark with her , hiding from KGB , not immigration . Or perhaps he was a member of a hate-group . I could get no clear indication from him . Even with plenty of warm , Sense enhancing Stoli in me , his tension was an occluder . The bartender 's gaze shifted and I turned to look at the immigration officer now standing on my right . Without moving my elbows from the bar , I showed her my open passport . In the peripheral glow from the flashlight , her face was calm , unworried ; she might have been an acquaintance looking at pictures of my family . She moved the flashlight beam to my face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , all I could see of her eyes now . Everything stopped . After awhile , she said , " Thank you , Maria Tell , " her accent making the words musical . She held her head high as she turned around . I could feel the bartender staring hard at me as the woman made her way to the door , where the other officers were waiting . They filed out in another blast of Moscow winter wind that cleared a little of the smoke and briefly over-rode the ancient space-heaters . I could still Sense her aching feet , her fatigue , her discomfort in the cold , her wish that they could just give this foreigner watering-hole a fast once-over and leave empty-handed , through for the night ; and if by chance there were refuseniks with forged papers among the crowd , then please do n't let her have to find them , let it be one of the others who would have to stay up the rest of the night inputting and contacting DIRTY WORK V  | embassy officials and whatnot . All she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downloaded from the International Net . That made me the genie who had granted her wish . No wonder she 'd thanked me so politely . The blonde emerged from under my coat , swiping at her mussed hair and looking dazed , as if she had just awakened with no idea how she 'd come to be here . " God , I had no hope that would work , I was just desperate and crazy ? " She saw the bartender and her expression became wary . But instead of throwing her out , he leaned on the bar and looked directly into my face . " Do you have a brother ? " he asked in heavily accented English . And then , of course , I knew exactly what Johnny had been doing all this time in Moscow . " I 'm in it for the same reason as anybody else , " said the blonde , puffing along beside me in the cold . " Artistic freedom . " I made a polite noise , or tried to . My lungs felt frozen . The blonde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friend for life . " The Russians understand , " she went on . " They know what repression really is . They make movies here where people drink and use drugs , they can make fun of religion . They 've got Huckleberry Finn in the libraries  --  it 's pretty weird in Russian , but they 've got it in the original English , too . And God , rock music ! All kinds of stuff you ca n't hear in the States any more , old rap , new rap , heavy-fucking-metal that tells you to kill yourself , for chrissakes . And in the happy-hood parlors , it 's anything goes , hard-core , soft-core , violence , whatever you want , and no goddam Council for the Prevention of Mind-Control to come in and pull the plug on you  --  hell , you can even get abortions on demand here , did you know that ? On demand . All you have to do is walk into a clinic and you do n't even have to give them a reason ? " " Still ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kremlin , " I said . " But I guess nobody 's perfect , eh ? " She did n't hear me . She ran on and on about the Constitution being fucked like the air and water and land had been fucked and how it was just going to get worse and worse . Whether she was saying all this for my benefit or her own was n't clear even to her . Not that it mattered any more . Her visa had run out three weeks before and she was now officially refusenik , subject to arrest and deportation . I wondered if she was aware of the original meaning of refusenik , but I was n't curious enough to use the Sense to find out . There were scads of these new refuseniks running around Moscow and elsewhere in the Soviet Union . I could n't decide whether they were yet another premillennial nut-group , the  | start of ' a real movement , or just more people living in their own brand of artificial reality . But then , I predated the Berlin Wall and , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even when the Sense told me they were all quite sane , if not especially wise . What Evie Gray was more than anything else was especially wealthy . I did n't point out to her that this was the only way she could have managed this dramatic flight to freedom . It 's yet another Home Truth that only the richest and the poorest ever attain freedom , the richest because they can afford it , the poorest because nobody 's ever looking for them . " You do n't share a brother-sister resemblance , " said the woman with the long , straight hair . " More like mother and son . If you ' 11 pardon my saying so . I smiled at her ; she did n't smile back . Russians were sparing with their smiles . Whoever had taught her English had been from Boston . " He 's adopted . " " Excuse me ? " She looked puzzled . " Nothing . Yuri at the Kropotkin hard currency bar gave me this address . " Her gaze slid to Evie Gray . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Almost , but it was averted , " I said . " Good answer , " Evie murmured . " I understand , " said the woman , stepping to the dark velvet curtain behind her . She sounded friendlier but she still did n't smile . " You realize this is a very exclusive mesto ; foreign visitors who come here must reserve many months in advance and the wait list is already a year long . " The bundle in Evie 's outthrust hand was obscenely thick . " I can pay . " The woman made it disappear almost before my new American friend realized she had taken it . " Next time , you should be more discreet . Put it in a little sack and pass it . If others saw , you could be marked as worth robbing . " " I would n't let that happen , " I said , " but we promise we 'll be more careful in the future . " " Harashow . This way . " She pulled the curtain aside and stepped into the headjob parlor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it : mesto  --  literally , place . Some place else might have been more like it . The Russians had embraced virtual reality with a religious fervor . Having been through only a few days of a Russian winter and hearing it called unseasonably warm , I could understand . But virtual reality was just as major in the States and any other country developed enough to maintain the technology . I could understand that , too . It was merely the next logical step after television and video games , really . 186 DIRTT WORK V  | The mesto was n't much like an American arcade . Instead of little single or double booths , there were rows of what looked like old barber chairs , about fifty altogether , all of them occupied by people wearing headpieces and action-gloves . Lots of weird hand-motions going on , some I could guess at and some I would n't have wanted to . There were no individual units  --  all the cables from the equipment disappeared into the floor . Centralized transmission ; no variety , but it would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing the profit margin to something that even an old 80s greed-is-good throwback would call more than respectable . " How long have you been operating ? " I asked the woman as I followed her to the end of the last row of chairs . " Almost a year , " she said . At the end of the row was a vacant chair , the only one in the room , with a head-piece sitting on it like an abandoned crown . " Your companion bought you an hour 's worth , " the woman said , gesturing at it . " Take your pleasure . " I blew out an irritated breath . " That 's not what I 'm here for . " " If you want to see your brother , you 'll take the hour . " She picked up the head-piece and held it out to me . It did n't make any sense , and I was having a hard time with the Sense as well . The long , cold walk from the Kropotkin had sobered me up and I was dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her indicated that somehow , she was telling the truth . Maybe Johnny wanted me all tangled up with wires and distracted with fancy pictures before he 'd talk to me , figuring that would keep me from sussing him out . As if this artificial reality could come between us any better than the one he 'd made for himself . Dream on , and on , and on , Johnny . The woman helped me with the gloves and then started to put the headpiece on me . " I 'd like some Stoli , please , " I said . " This is not a voluta bar , " she said . " We do n't serve anything . If you wanted drinks , you should have brought your own . " " Get her some vodka . " Evie slipped a hand into her pocket . " You can get me some , too . " The woman hesitated . " And bring a straw . You know , one of those hollow tube things you can suck liquids through ? " I added , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding some dispensers for the headpieces ? " " Yeah , it 's the same fuck-the-tourists crap all over , " said Evie . " Shut up , " I told her . " Sometimes there 's a bottle back in the office . A straw ? " the woman shrugged . " I 'll see what I can find . " She took something from Eviediscreetly enough , I supposed  --  and slipped out a nearby door . Evie moved to help me with the head-piece . PAT CADIIAN IH7 V  | " Hold it , " I said . She drew hack a little , looking stung . " I ca n't go on helping you indefinitely , you know . " " Ca n't ? " She gave me a fast , pained grin . " You mean wo n't , right ? " " Look , I can fix it so tired cops do n't see what they do n't want to see . But I do n't forge residency papers . And I 'm not staying in Russia any longer than I have to . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could n't you ? " I wanted to shake her . " Is this place really so much better than the U.S. ? You think Russia is heaven just because they 've got Huckleberry Finn on the shelves and rap music on the radio and abortion on demand ? Does the name Stalin ' many anything to you ? How about Pamyat ' ? They were just another anti-Semitic hate group in the early 90s , but now even their staunchest sympathizers are afraid of them . And they 're not the only haters running around loose , all of them with their own agendas , but two things they all agree on : they hate Jews and they hate refuseniks . You think all of the missing ones are just blending in with their forged papers ? Plenty of them are lying on slabs in a Moscow morgue , gutted like cattle , courtesy of Pamyat . " " Pamyat is a bad word around here . Do n't use it . " The woman reappeared and thrust a bottle that was a little over half-full at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I have no idea what you 'll do with it when you 're inside . " I took a couple of healthy swigs and stuck the bottle between my thighs . She shrugged and looked at Evie . " I 'll wait right here , " Evie said . " Hurry up and take your hour . There 's a long line behind you . " She pushed the head-piece all the way down so that my face was covered and the eye-screen lit up immediately . I joined a standard dolphin's-eye sequence . As soon as artificial reality had become feasible for the mass-market , everyone had gone for the dolphin and whale stuff . Out of guilt , maybe : sorry we killed so many of you , so we 'll be you , or pretend we are . I would have been bored except the quality was way beyond anything I 'd ever seen before . The Russians must have been cranking away on hardware r &d,; boosting definition and whatever else . But the head-piece had n't looked like it was anything so extraordinary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaped bodies that turned right and then left as one , lifting themselves out of my path like a curtain . Near a boulder , a fleshy squid ignored me , its tentacles rippling . Seaweed drifted , sank away into the shadows . Nothing new here , nothing in the least , but the quality  --  my inner ear kept flashing swimming 188 DIRTY WORK V  | messages to my stomach , where the disloyal Stoli had turned on me with a threat . Disloyal opposition . I hung onto the arms of the chair and tried to keep part of my awareness tuned to where I knew my body was , waiting for Johnny 's presence to press in on the Sense . I might have been cruising the ocean for ten minutes , or almost the whole hour ; my sense of time had slipped away like one more darting ocean creature . But the novelty was wearing off and I felt bored , impatient , and slightly dizzy . The perspective made a sudden wide arc to the left and passed through a multi-colored rock formation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but never moved as I passed . Just beyond the rocks was a giant clam , the ridges of the shell perfectly formed . It began to open as I approached  --  more standard stuff  --  displaying the giant pearl in the giant clam was usually the climax and indicated a change to the next sequence . So much for my hour and finding Johnny , I thought , watching the clamshell rise . When I got out of the chair , I was going to chug the rest of the Stoli and use the Sense to make the mesto hostess do cartwheels until she dropped . **39;0; The clamshell was gaping wide and it was n't a pearl displayed there but a man , curled up in the fetal position . He unfolded slowly and gracefully , the way everything moves underwater , and turned to look at me . Same old sweet , mad Johnny . His shoulder-length brown hair was floating around his head , his hazel eyes were like stars in his lovely , open face . **1610;41; **454;1679;<But He did n't have to explain . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , I think . Johnny 's likeness might as well have been him . It had its own power within the artificial universe , blocking our little exchange from the rest of the clientele . A hundred people looking and none of them saw . I would have said a connection between a living being with the Sense and a likeness was impossible , except obviously none of us had tried it until now . **665;2141; He looked away from me , dreamily reaching up to run a finger along the belly of a passing shark . **512;2817; The push came so forcefully that I would have sworn he 'd found someone else with the Sense and the two of them were ganging up on me . The likeness , I realized ; Johnny had invested a great deal in it as the would-I ! I() 1 ) I It T Y W 0 It K  | be escape hatch from the prison of his life , and wherever Johnny went , the Sense went with him . I had Stoli , but Johnny had this , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make him  --  him and his likeness ? ? acknowledge the connection between us and fortify its existence . I almost had him . Perhaps I had had him  --  his miracle world was more wonderful , but I was more familiar . And then rough hands tore the head-piece away and I heard the mesto hostess say , " Time 's up . " The cold was what really brought me to , though I was already staggering along Gorky Street . Famous Gorky Street , I remembered ; every few years , the Russians would change the name to something else but for some reason , they 'd always end up changing it back again . Evie Gray had her shoulder wedged under my armpit and my arm slung across her shoulders . She was chattering away but my head was too bad to make sense ( or Sense ) of what she was saying and the traitor Stoli in my gut was like a washing machine on the heavy soil setting . Somehow , little old Evie knew  --  I say it 's a Home Truth that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot of the Sense  --  and got me to an alley where I could throw up in peace . Good-bye Stoli , and good-night , Gracie . Or Evie . I was dulled out . After awhile , Evie got me moving again . She was still chattering ? Christ , this woman never ran out of breath , I guess -- and I caught the word problem . " The real problem , Evie , old girl , " I said , talking loudly over her , " the real problem here  --  and I think the Russians really do understand this ?

' I do n't know what to do about that , Evie . Even with the Sense , I just do n't know what to do about it . " I heard her clear her throat . " Why do n't you just shut up ? " She took a real chance dumping me at Intourist . She could have just left me on the street for the authorities to pick up  --  probably nothing would have happened , I was n't refusenik , after all  --  and the fact that she got me indoors PAT CADIGAN ' - V  | before she disappeared indicated a sweet generosity of ' spirit within that foolish chatterbox exterior . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do her . I got a plane out the next morning  --  all I had to do was find an Aeroflot ticket agent with a xenophobic bent and give a little push . The genie of the bottle grants your wish and leaves your country . The layover in London was supposed to be just a few hours , but Gatwick shut down indefinitely with a bomb scare  --  bomb scares were coming more frequently as December 31 approached  --  so I took the train into London , figuring I might as well be comfortable . Besides , I 'd never seen London . Forgot my own Home Truth : one place is pretty much like another . There was nothing for me to do in London either but drink . But London really understands the drinking organism the way Moscow was trying to . The pubs were warm and mellow . Guinness was even better on the Sense than Stoli had been , and I almost did n't care when Gatwick stayed shut another day and another , and Heathrow with it . I did n't call home . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only be telling them the details , and those could wait . Those could wait and I could drink , and like anyone in artificial reality , I lost track of the time , which was how I came to be in London on Christmas Eve , looking down a week to the ( artificial ) dawn of the ( artificial ) new millennium . Feeling the Lack and filling it with Guinness . Travel was impossible now . There were riots every day , and not just in London . The Messiah was coming , they said ; the Messiah was coming . Then the transmission from Russia began . But I did n't bother trying to tell anyone that it was n't really the Messiah . Just Johnny . Happy-hood parlors all over London filled up , left the pubs empty ( more for me , I thought , wavering at times between bitters and Guinness ) . Centralized transmission . No variety , but the quality ... oh , the quality . Lost nothing bouncing off a satellite , not with Johnny on the job . Johnny on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) dawn of the ( artificial ) new millennium . What everyone wanted all along , I guess . And as to what Johnny wanted ... not to be chained , to be free . He got both , thanks to the Sense , in any reality he chooses . The Sense is a funny thing , and it can even be a good thing . I worked it pretty hard on him , but as I told Evie Gray , nobody 's perfect . We 'll get what we wanted , too , me and the rest of the group back in the States , when the transmissions to America begin , when poor , sweet , mad Johnny finally comes home .  | This was written for Peter Crowther 's Narrow Houses , an anthology of stories dealing with superstitions . Of course , I 'm not superstitious , and neither are you , right ?

Now find the connection between these musings and this story . If you dare . ( P.S. : A person who makes patterns where there are none is an artist. )  | It had been years since I 'd had the dream . So many years that I thought I 'd finally outgrown it , if there is such a thing as outgrowing a recurring dream . It was the only recurring dream I 'd ever had , and when I stopped having it , I 'd all but forgotten about it . As time goes on , little pieces of life drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always figured that coming across them again meant you were retraveling old territory , either because you 'd missed something important the first time through or you 'd just gotten jammed up , stuck in a rut . I 'd also always figured that it would happen to me , even more than once , but the dream took me by surprise anyway . In the dream , I 'm way out in an enormous area , a kind of ghost-field , and I 'm standing partially below the ground . I used to think I was in a hole or a well , or maybe even just shrunk to the size of an apple , but it 's none of those things . I 'm just lower than the surface , sunk into the ground deeply enough that the long , wild weeds tower over my head . It 's almost dark  --  the clear sky is the deep blue that comes in the last minutes of sunset . There 's a golden glow in the west ; stars are beginning to appear . I keep looking up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeds leaning in the pre-night breeze , and in that suspended moment , my mother walks by . It 's more of a very slow stroll , a drift . She is n't here to find me . She is n't looking for anyone or anything , because , I realize , she knows where everything is , or where it ought to be . And then somebody calls her name . The voice is distant yet very clear , like one of those stars overhead . But the name it calls is not my mother 's V  | name . Except that somehow it is . I know that it is . Not because my mother turns toward the voice with a genuinely frightened expression that I have never seen on her face in real life  --  I know this is her name because it fits her , describes her , is her . It 's the articulation of her , mentally , physically , spiritually , any way at all , anything that is about her , in her , of her , what she has seen , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will never tell . My mother takes a step backward  --  I 'm not sure whether it 's to run , or to brace herself against some imminent attack , and I know that she is n't sure , either . I know everything about my mother now , I realize . But of course I do  --  it 's all contained in that name , that Name , her Name . And I think to myself , I 've got to remember this . I 've got to remember everything I know about her now , everything I know about her and everything I know about our life together and her life before me and after I went out on my own . I 've got to remember the way she thinks ... That 's as far as my thoughts go , however , because then she turns and sees me through the bending weeds . Her black hair flares with the movement , her face is tight , eyes wide , the cords in her neck stand out starkly . I understand two things : first , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from , whoever it belongs to , called her Name , and second , the voice is about to call another Name , and this one will be mine . That was where I always woke up , and it was no different this time . For a long time , I lay staring at the distorted oblong of light thrown across the ceiling by the window . The bedroom of my current apartment had an eastern exposure and I always opened the curtains just before I went to sleep , so the sun could wake me in the morning . It was n't that I was so crazy for getting up with the sun ; I just liked lying there watching the morning come on before I had to join the rest of the world . My insistence on easing into a day and easing out of it was probably why I did n't have much in the way of those cultural trophies most people have by the time they 're staring thirty in the face , but then , I was n't working on an ulcer or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't eat much , there is n't much that eats you . Most mothers would have said that was no kind of attitude to have . Maybe mine would have , but probably not out loud , or at least not to my face . All mother-daughter relationships have a certain amount of odd to them , but ours was odder than most . This was probably because it had always been just Is . The focus becomes a lot tighter between a parent and child when there 's to one else in the house  --  no distractions . I went from infant to very young roommate to accomplice , and I stayed an accomplice for a long , long time , until we both sensed there was a change coming , some fork in the road that neant she had to go her way and I had to go mine . It was that bloodless . As I lay there , I tried to remember everything I 'd known about her in the  | dream . I could still feel what it was like to know but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd woken up , every bit , including that Name I 'd heard . The only thing I knew without a doubt was that she was going to call me . Where was she now , anyway ? Seattle , still ? The fogginess that dreams always leave behind had n't cleared out of my head yet , I was n't ready to connect with anything real . Except for that certainty that my mother was going to call , and very soon . Heat shimmies ran through the block of light on the ceiling . The details of the day were starting to press on me but I already felt removed from everything , pulled out of my routine to some place where no one else could go . I picked up the phone on the first ring . " Did I wake you ? " asked my mother . " No . This is the time I usually wake up . " " Ah . " My mother is one of those people who remembers things audibly . " Well , I 've been up all night . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , not exactly wrong . There 's a problem . " " What is it ? " I asked . I knew exactly what she was going to say but sometimes you ca n't skip any steps in a process . " It 's ... it 's hard to explain on the phone . Easier if you just come here and I can lay the whole thing out for you . " " Uh-huh . " " I do n't know what you 're doing now ... what kind of job do you have ? " " I 'm a chauffeur . " I smiled into the phone at her baffled silence . " A limo driver . I take people out to the airport and pick them up when their planes come in . Nothing I ca n't walk away from . " " Yes , that 's you . Never do anything you ca n't walk away from . " " It always seemed like a good policy , " I said , pushing down the sheet and kicking it off . " Well , will you come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what do you think . " I could have saved my job by just saying I had a family emergency  --  my mother was in the hospital in critical condition and I had to rush to her bedside for a will-she-live-or-die vigil  --  but I did n't . It was n't that I was so scrupulously truthful  --  in fact , I 've always lied quite a lot  --  but that there are times when a lie is ... bad . Now , that would sound crazy to all those lovers of truth walking the streets in search of an honest man with their lanterns dangling precariously in front of their self-righteous noses . But the fact is , the truth is a very dangerous thing and most people are n't very careful with it because most of the time , they do n't even recognize it . Consequently , they end up lying when they think they 're being truthful , and spilling the truth DIRTY WORK  | when they think they 're covering tip . Only if you know what the truth is can a lie he useful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who has ever kept quiet to keep from looking foolish has no business feeling disdainful at that . Truth , or a lie : the right tool for the right job , that 's all it is . I knew that whatever my mother had called me about had something to do with truth , and so if I 'd lied to my supervisor at the Silver Eagle Limo Service , I 'd have queered things somehow , gotten off to a bad start and gone downhill from there . So I just told him that I was going to see my mother in Seattle ( I 'd remembered right ) and I did n't know how long I 'd be gone . Victor went around and around about it and , I had to go along with him , because otherwise he would never have seen . He asked me if she was sick and I said no , not to my knowledge . Was she in the hospital ? No , of course not , if she was n't sick , then she would n't be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother seemed to feel it was . Did she have anybody out there she could turn to ? No , no one . What about my father ? I hedged on that and just said , good question . Which it was , since I did n't know the answer myself . Was my mother in trouble ? Yes , some kind but she had n't told me what . Could I find out ? Not without going to see her . He 'd pause there and sit back from his messy desk , tapping his lower front teeth with a pen until he hurt himself . Then he 'd sit up straight , tap the pen on the desk , and start all over again . Was my mother sick ? Not that I knew of . Was she in the hospital ? No . Was this an emergency ? For her , yes . Was n't there anyone else ? No . Your father ? Good question . Was she in trouble ? Yes . What kind ? Shrug . Sit back ; tap teeth ; wince ; sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recurring dream . I wondered idly if Victor had ever had one . Finally he came out with the cycle-breaker : who did I think was going to do my airport runs if I just took off ? I said I did n't know , I had n't seen the work schedule . That did it for him , of course , but he had to ask one last question just to make sure  --  why did I insist on screwing everything up like this , did I really want to make everything hard on everyone else ? No , I told him , I just wanted to go see my mother . So that made him sure he 'd had enough and he fired me . I turned in my uniform and a driver named Barney let me deadhead out to the airport , where he was going to pick up half a dozen people named Gershon returning from a family reunion . I sat in the front seat and Barney chattered all the way out , mostly about what a dick Victor was and how smart I 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployment . I had n't thought of that ; it had just been cleaner , more definite . I could face Seattle and my mother completely unencum-bered.  | Well , maybe not completely -- I still had my apartment , but there was n't much in it that belonged to me , and anything I felt I could n't do without was in my backpack . I could return to it or not , and it would n't make a bit of difference in the long run , like a disposable bookmark . Barney gave me a raised fist salute as he drove away from the curb at the terminal to go in search of the homeward-bound Gershons . It gave me a good feeling , as if he had passed me a little of his power to use for the trip , so I could conserve my own . I 'd never thought of myself as a superstitious person , but then it 's bad luck to say you 're superstitious . No ; actually , I 'd just never thought of it in those terms but I suppose that , seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inside , I thought of it as having experience . My mother was waiting right there at the gate when I got off the plane in Seattle . She was easy to spot in the crowd , even though at five feet , she had to look up at most people , including me . Her black hair , streaked with a little more silver than last time I 'd seen her , flowed down below her shoulders , a few strands catching here and there on her gauzy peasant blouse . She had probably bought the calf-length skirt at one of those semi-ethnic shops , though I could n't tell which culture she was paying tribute to . The dark socks crumpled around the tops of her hiking shoes made her legs look like sticks . " You look good , Mom , " I said , bending down to hug her . Her hands batted against my shoulders like nervous , fluttering birds . " I look the same . " " And that 's good . " She reached up and brushed back the hair hanging over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her disapproval , but she just tucked one hand into the crook of my elbow and led me through the airport , telling me about the big old house she 'd acquired and how the rain made her woolen wall-hangings smell . The cool , damp air was a relief after the unrelenting dry and hot spell in the Midwest . I 'd never been to this area of the country before and I could see why my mother had ended up here . The climate and the mountains suited her , and the city was variegated enough to accommodate all kinds of perspectives . " As close to an enlightened society as I 'm going to come , " she said , pulling up in front of a three-storey brick house . The porch had been painted recently . " I suppose stain would look better , but I had a coupon for Glidden ' s rainy-day grey . " " Really ? " She paused in the act of unlocking the front door . " What do you think . "  | My mother would hoist me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason than to show that she could . I smelled the woolen wall-hangings as soon as I walked in . There were two very large ones hanging on either side of the entry hall , straw-colored things with mandala-like patterns woven into them . " Mary had a monster lamb , " I said , sniffing . " Was this ever sheepherding country ? I ca n't remember . " " You never knew , " said my mother . " It 's impossible to remember what you 've never known . I do n't know , either . " I dropped my backpack at the foot of the stairs and followed her into the kitchen for the tea-making ritual . All visitors , including me , meant a freshbrewed pot of darjeeling . In many ways , my mother was like an eccentric from central casting , and on purpose , as if following a script was her safety net . She kept chatting about innocuous things while she heated some designer bottled water and prepared the teapot and cups . It was an antique pot , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit like Aladdin 's lamp . She 'd had it for as long as I could remember and I had no idea how it had managed to survive so many moves without even getting chipped . Still telling me about the other women in her food co-op , she put everything on a bamboo tray and led me into the living room which had only Japanese-style mats around a long , low table . I was starting to feel a little restless and impatient and even though I tried to suppress my feelings , my mother knew . " Just trying to keep you from getting a case of the psychic bends , " she said , pouring carefully . " You know how that can be , going from one world into another . " " Do you live in another world , Mom ? " " Always have . You know that , too . " I picked up the cup . Something strange mixed in with the tea aroma hit my nose . " What 's in this ? " I said , frowning at the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relax . " " You 're the one who always said that if I were any more relaxed , I 'd be on life support . " " You need to relax your mind . I want it all open and receptive . " I smiled . " Are you going to play with my mind , Mom ? Reshape it ? Do n't you think it 's little late for that ? I 've already made a lot of choices . " She smiled back at me through the steam snaking upwards from her own cup . " Yes , not to choose is to choose , I told you that myself and I do n't regret it . The tea tasted as strange as it smelled ; whatever had been added gave PAT CADI ( ; AN I  | it a musty under-flavoring , like something on the verge of going stale . It made my tongue feel dry . " You 've always trusted me , have n't you , " my mother said , watching me drink . " Why should n't I ? You 're my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes suddenly became very bright , as if they were welling up . " Yes , that sort of trust is very important , is n't it . Child trusts mother , mother presumably trusts child . But I have n't always trusted you , I 'm sorry to say . That was n't your fault , and it was n't mine . Sometimes things just happen in ways they are n't supposed to . But you see , children are n't really trustworthy . Not in the adult sense . " She finished her cup and poured herself another . I was n't halfway through my own . There seemed to be so much of it , an ocean of tea in one little cup . I would have tried to finish it anyway , but I could n't move . " You have n't had this in a long time , so it does n't take much for you , " my mother said , matter-of-factly . " I 've built up quite a tolerance over the years , so I 'll have to drink most of the pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did n't . I did n't mind anything ; I did n't mind having been called halfway across the country so my mother could drug me . This was more the drug than my roll-with-it worldview and I knew it . But I did n't mjnd about that , either . If anything , it was a relief to know that I had to be drugged to be this compliant . " The last time you drank this tea , you were eight years old , " my mother said . Her words seemed to melt into my brain . " That was the only other time . You do n't remember because I told you not to . Now , I 'm telling you to remember why I gave it to you . " Obediently , or maybe reflexively , my memory began to reconfigure itself , as if it were a stage set undergoing a scenery change by an intangible crew , pieces being turned around , turned over , regrouped to reveal hidden designs and different uses . Here was an old interest in music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'd never gotten around to making ; there was an old talent for drawing left to atrophy ; over there was a high-school level French book I 'd been reading in an empty classroom after school , half-listening to my third-grade teacher explain something called The Gifted-And-Talented Program to my mother , just before we made another of our many moves away . Here was everything , in vivid technicolor and three dimensions , that I 'd once wanted to fill up my life with but then turned away from , all interest gone . It was somebody else 's dream now , but I could get a little of the feeling of what it had been like when it had been my own dream . That dream was replaced by another I was more familiar with . My head drooped forward and my eyes closed . I heard my mother 's skirt rustle as she  | got up and came around to help me he down before I tell over . She put one hand on my forehead and reached across the table for her tea with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the warmth of her hand on me intensified , making my skin tingle . " You knew , " she said after a while . " You were a very talented , knowing little girl , perceptive , intuitive . I thought this would be useful at first , for both of us . There would be so much I would n't have to tell you , I thought , so much that I would n't have to explain or prove to you or , failing that , hide from you . " It was your lineage coming out , of course . I congratulated myself on that  --  having chosen well so that the combination of mother and father would result in a child with our strengths and gifts naturally reinforced . In those days , I believed we secret people should only marry each other , or at least breed only with each other , because I thought only about things like dilution . I did n't really know anything about genetics . I still do n't know very much , but I do know that it applies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stacked the deck but there was no guarantee that you 'd get the winning hand . You could have come out with almost everything recessive and only a stronger-than-average empathetic streak to show for all my hopes ... " She paused . " I 'd have loved you just as much ... " Her voice trailed off again and I could feel how she wanted to believe that last statement but she really was n't sure . I felt bad for her , for her shame over it . I 'd always said there were times when the truth was vastly over-rated and this was certainly one of them . " But it 's ridiculous to speculate on what might have been when it 's something that ca n't be , " she went on , adjusting her hand on my forehead . " After all , you were everything I had hoped for . You were the perfect tribute to my pride and vanity . I did n't understand that was how I saw you until it was brought home to me that I had been concentrating on your gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " All feeling of my surroundings had faded away now as well as any sensation of my physical body , with the exception of the warm spot that was my mother 's hand . It was the focus of my awareness and of my mother 's voice , the only thing that seemed to be keeping me from floating away . " You flourished , as any hothouse flower will in the absence of adverse forces and natural enemies . There should be no constraints , I thought , and no restraints . Why should n't you know everything there was to know about ... oh , god , I 'm not sure I can tell you now . Except that we live in many worlds all at once and secret people  --  you , me , your father , certain others ? can use the multiplicity of forces in them to our own advantage . " What we do depends on what our talents tend toward . Some of us use our special knowledge to become healers  --  but you 'll find very , very few either in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tabloids . There are teachers PAT CADIaAN I  | who have never been in a classroom , leaders who seem to do nothing all their lives but follow . " You were just finding your way through the possibilities when you spoke my Name . " I almost heard it in my mind  --  that Name from the dream , her secret Name . Had it been my voice , then ? I did n't think so , but I could n't remember what it had sounded like , whether it was a child 's or an adult 's , a man 's or a woman 's . " You did n't understand what you were doing , of course . Not the magnitude of it . I had n't even told you anything about Names , that 's how powerful you had already become . It was something you had simply divined , a leap in logic that was the equivalent of an eight-year-old understanding nuclear fission by learning about atoms . " But far , far more dangerous . " There was a familiarity to what she was telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She might have been reminding me about an old movie we had watched together . " I was lucky you were a child , with all of a child 's love and respect and dependence . Especially dependence . You still wanted me to be Mother when you Named me . You did n't want the power over me that Naming me had given you . You did n't even realize what it meant to Name me , though that understanding would n't have been long in coming to you . " But it was n't you I was really worried about , it was him . The third person in the equation that gave you to me , of course . " She paused . " You never asked me about your father , you know . You never even asked me if you had a father , or where he was , not even while you were free to do so . I do n't know what I would have told you if you had  --  maybe just that he and I had gone our separate ways before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know why he never wanted to see you and I did n't really want to have to explain that he did n't know about you because I had n't told him . " He found out , though . He found out the moment you Named me . " A picture of a man 's face was forming in my mind . I 'd never seen him before but I knew this had to be my father . He was old enough to be my grandfather . His years became him , probably better than his youth had ; very encouraging , since I looked a great deal more like him than I did my mother . " That should n't have happened . Because he did n't know about you , there should n't have been a link . But it was there . Maybe you were just so powerful that he could n't help sensing you , sensing what you are . Or maybe he was suspicious after I conveniently took myself out of his life instead of trying to hang onto him . Anyway , before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone else indiscriminately  --  and to prevent you from letting your own Name slip  --  he called me. "  | " ' I want to congratulate you on the success of your project , ' he said , all cheery-nasty . ' Our little monster ? ' he actually called you that our little monster is certainly a prodigy . If you had let me know . I would have been generous with support checks . But if you did n't want my support in the past , I do n't suppose you want it now . ' " You 're right , ' I told him , ' I want nothing from you , I need nothing from you . ' " Nothing more , you mean , ' he said . Listen , I 'm all for everyone 's right to self-determination , but do n't you think it 's rude beyond the pale to use a person 's own tissue this way without so much as a please or thank-you ? I certainly do . I have to tell you that while I was apparently what you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So what , ' I said . " So we 're a family now , that 's what , ' he said . Whether you like it or not . You ca n't have it both ways , you know , I ca n't be the father and not be the father at the same time . Which means that you and I are connected now , if not exactly bound . But I 've found in my old age that I suddenly respect that kind of bond much more than I used to . There are certain advantages . I would ask you to marry me , but you did n't ask for what you wanted so I do n't feel obliged to ask now for what I want . And I do n't have to . Our little monster will just give it to me . ' " He meant my Name , of course . And yours . He would eventually have been able to divine your Name because of his link to you . Once he knew your Name , he would have complete power over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Getting you to tell him my Name would be pretty much an anticlimax , but he 'd have done it anyway , just to show he could . " The effects of whatever she had put in the tea were receding ... sort of . I was beginning to feel more alert mentally , the memories were becoming more vivid , more real , and more personally involving . " I thought about killing you , " my mother said . I remembered that , too , though I had n't really understood at the time . I 'd just had the idea that my mother was considering something harmful and I had n't been so much afraid as curious . Because I 'd known that in the end , she would n't hurt me ... could n't hurt me ... " No , I could n't . You would n't let me . That was the last time you exercised the power of my Name over me . And you were right ; even if I could have brought myself to kill my own child , it would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that it was murder had gone unnoticed ? I could have fixed it that way  --  your father would have known and that would have given him a certain amount of power over me . Not quite as much as knowing my Name , but too much . I had brought you into the world without his consent ; to send you out of it also without his consent would have  | cost me my will . I would never have been able to do anything again without his permission . He could n't have forced me to do anything  --  like tell him my Name  --  but he could have prevented me from doing anything simply by telling me I could n't . Whether it was using my powers or just washing my face . " She paused . " You 've seen people who seem to be unable to take care of themselves , have n't you ? Many of them are just incompetent for some prosaic reason . But many others are secret people who lost their souls . " She sighed and I realized that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , I hid you . Actually , I sent you into hiding within yourself . The only reason I could do it was because you let me . You could have stopped me  --  after all , you knew my Name  --  but you were a little girl . You wanted me to take care of you . So I took care of you . I gave you some nice hot tea and told you that nothing mattered any more and you would forget everything . Including my Name . " So I 'd grown up healthy , happy , and completely detached , unaware of my power , or my mother 's , or my father 's . Whatever power meant  --  flying through the air ? Leaping tall buildings , picking winning lottery numbers , raising the dead ? " You 're a knower . Like your father . What you know about , you have power over . If you want it , it 's yours , if you do n't want it , it goes away . That does n't mean you would n't have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay , and , like anything else , sometimes the price-tag is n't worth the goods . I do n't know what course you 'd have chosen for yourself once you had come into your own and sometimes I wonder if this was n't the right thing after all . Maybe it would n't have been right to let someone so powerful walk loose in the world , even if it had turned out you had wanted nothing more than some personal success and material rewards and an especially long life-span . That stuff 's cheap , when you can have all you want . " Well , that was over twenty years ago and I figured that was the end of it . Even if your father came face to face with you , he 'd never recognize you for who or what you were , and I did n't have to worry about your telling anyone my Name or your own . " You do know your own Name , by the way . You learned it before you learned mine , but you never told it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't make you forget that , but I was able to camouflage it . It 'll take you a little while to figure it out , but it 'll come to you . And you 'll need it , because apparently my hiding you did n't put an end to things the way I thought it would . " Your father did n't call me again but he had to have known that I 'd done something to protect you . I knew that he 'd look for us , so I kept us moving . Movement is very strong power when done in the right sequence . That was  | one of my specialties ; I 'm a traveler and , by extension , a geographer . I turned every place we went into unfamiliar country , so that he 'd always get lost before he could even get near us . " And then you grew up and left , and I thought that would mean we were permanently safe , because he could n't possibly go in two directions at once . I kept traveling anyway while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could n't go in two directions at once . He just came after me . " It took him a long , long time , but I 'd underestimated his , oh , dedication , I guess you could call it . He honestly felt I had stolen from him , you see , and he was incomplete until he recovered what was rightfully his . That would be you . But you were too well hidden even for the blood-link between you and him , so he concentrated on finding me . " Travelers who do n't want to be found might as well be invisible . As far as he was concerned , I thought I was . But I 'd never thought that he would actually go to all the time and trouble of following me . The problem , you see , is that unfamiliar country does n't stay unfamiliar ; sooner or later , you can figure it out if you want to badly enough . And he did . " It took a chunk of his life  --  over twenty years and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess he figured that being in debt to a timekeeper was worth it . If he could catch up with me and get to you , he 'd be able to pay it all back with interest and still end up with more time than he 'd had at the start . " She started rubbing my hands and I realized they 'd gone numb . My whole body was numb ; it was coming back to life , the feeling that was returning to my hands spreading up my arms and out to the rest of me . " In recreating my travels , he has come to know a great deal about me . And about you . I hid you from your power , but I could n't hide the fact that you are powerful , and power calls to power . It wo n't be long before he knows my Name . He 's getting closer to it all the time and I ca n't do anything about it  --  in the act of trying to stop him , I would only reveal the last of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " I opened my eyes . The living room was gone ; so was my mother . I was lying on my back in the field under the evening sky . Raising up on my elbow , I looked around . Through the weeds , I could see something that might have been my mother 's silhouette . It moved suddenly and melted into the darker night shadows behind it . Safe for now , I thought , and turned away to face the golden glow on the other side of the sky . It was too bright to look at , and I had to close my eyes again . I woke up in a hotel room in downtown Seattle . Or was it uptown Seattle ? I did n't know how they numbered their streets here , but I knew I was  | in the city proper , whatever they called it , and my father was n't far away . My backpack was lying on the floor next to the bed . A mother will always remember you need clean underwear . Even a mother like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a traveler , I thought , amused , and got up to wash and dress . The hotel was one of those nondescript places that charge by the week , where people stay when they have no real place to go , all worn carpeting and thrift-shop furniture and stained porcelain in the bathroom . Up to twentyfour hours before , I would n't have thought anything about it one way or the other . There was a part of me that still did n't care ; old lifestyles die hard . But mostly , I wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible , find my father and do whatever I had to do about him , and then figure out how I was going to spend the rest of my life . The cool Seattle air was full of mist and I felt as if I were melting my way through it as I walked along the sidewalk . Having set me down somewhere near my father , my mother had left it to me to locate him exactly , as a way of flexing those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did n't take long . My father was very sure of himself these days . His power radiated uncamouflaged , like a dare : here I am , come and get me , if you can . And just to make sure there was no mistaking the address , my mother was in the front window of the gallery , looking out on the street with a wary expression so subtle that it could n't have read to anyone who did n't know her . Actually , her entire face would n't have read to anyone who did n't know her . The rendering was photographically real , but the subject had been painted as standing behind some transparent barrier so thick that it obscured and distorted . One hand was clutching the edge of the barrier hard enough that the knuckles were white but It would n't be clear  --  ha , ha  --  even after long study , whether she was trying to push the barrier aside , or hold it in place . Unless you knew her . ArTricks was the name on the door , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence rushed over me with the carefully climate-controlled air . The entire gallery had been given over to his work , not just for a few weeks or for a month , but indefinitely , though probably no one realized it . My father would camp here for as long as he needed or wanted , and that used-and-abandoned feeling would n't kick in for a long time after he left . I understood quite a lot about my father . It was all there in those paintings he 'd done of my mother . They were arranged on the gallery walls in a way that reminded me of the Stations of the Cross in a Catholic church . There was an intended sequence , or rather , two intended sequences . In the order dictated by his ? DIRTY WORK  | numbering , my mother 's face started out extremely obscured and progressed toward being more clearly identifiable . This was for the general population of art appreciators , who would see only paintings and believe one followed another just the way he said they did . The other sequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been done . The real first portrait was the clearest one in the sequence , the one everyone else was supposed to think was the most recent : Untitled #I2 . The obscuring barrier was only slightly less than window-clear  --  my father 's acknowledgment that he had known my mother as she had wanted him to know her . It resembled her in some ways , but she could have stood right next to it and no one would have identified her as the subject . The next one was on the other side of the airy gallery room , posing as the first one he 'd painted . The face was so completely obscured in this one that it was n't possible to tell where the features were , whether it was a man or a woman , or even a human being . He had followed that up with the portrait placed in the middle of the sequence , labelled Untitled , #6 . Had it been closer to #12 , it might have been possible to see that he 'd actually had much more understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had when he 'd done #12 . Or maybe not ; my father 's skill engaged expectations while it diffused perceptions . The third painting was #11 , his affirmation of the face my mother showed the world . Looking closely , I could see that he had painted her image in excruciatingly exact detail before muddying it . And so on . I found my way from portrait to portrait , moving back and forth among the dozen paintings , minus the one in the window , which was actually the most recent one . Yes , I thought , my father must have been very sure of himself , to display it so openly , telling my mother how close he was . In the next portrait , her face would be completely clear and so would her Name , not just to my father but to anyone with the ability to know . " Do you know Boileau ? " I had been so lost in the study of my mother 's face that the man had come up right behind me . He was very young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . " Pardon ? " I said . " Do you know Boileau ? The artist . I 've been watching you from my desk . I 've never seen anyone come in here and view the paintings in the real order before . " That my father had n't kept this completely a secret showed an arrogance that I found perversely pleasing . " Well , I know his other work , " I said . The man 's eyes narrowed . " Really ? That 's amazing , considering there is n't any other work . This is all there is  --  thirty years of discovering the same woman . When he finishes the last one , he says he 'll put down his brush for good . " PAT CADIGAN I  | " He says that , does he 's " I looked around ; my mother 's face seemed to jump out of each picture and then recede again . " I wonder what he 'll do to keep busy . " " Boileau is an extraordinary man as well as a gifted artist . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shrugged . " Oh , I do n't know . Sometimes when the grip of obsession loosens , people fall apart . Does he live around here ? " The guy clammed up . It was exactly like that  --  he put his lips together deliberately and looked away from me with a haughty tilt to his head , making it clear he was n't going to dignify my question by even recognizing it . I took a step back , looked him up and down , and spoke his Name . The effect was immediate ; I owned him . He 'd been pissing me off but mostly I did it to see what would happen . I had n't been prepared for the utterness of it , either because I was too used to not giving a rat 's ass one way or the other about most things , or because the idea of someone with absolutely no power at all really is unfathomable , until you 've seen it . I halfexpected him to turn into a blob of jelly or something , so unreserved was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn into a blob of jelly if I wanted him to . Whatever I wanted was now the law as far as he was concerned , and this was irreversible . He remained perfectly still while I walked around him , looking him over . He was just a gallery manager , a culture vulture whose life was focussed on finding The Next Big Thing in the artistic community , an insulated world that breathed rarefied air , followed its own traditions , anointed its own high priests , and admitted no outsiders . When this gallery closed , he would find another , and another after that . His function was to sit with art , and talk about it , and contain various facts and terms and acquaintances without knowing anything . Or it would have been , except I owned him now . I could have told him to be a truck-driver or a ditch-digger and he would have walked out of the gallery and gone off to drive trucks or dig ditches without a backward glance . " I just want you to take care of yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on as you were before , do whatever you were going to do , be whatever you were going to be . But tell me where he lives . " " He 's got a house on Vachon Island . You 'll need to take the ferry . " " What 's the address ? " " I do n't know . But I can draw you a map of how to get there . " " Then do that . And then go back to whatever you were doing before I came in here . Think you can manage that ? " " If you say so . " He drew me a map . He had no artistic talent at all , but it was a good enough map for my purposes . And it was all for my purposes . He was so I DIRTY WORK  | much mine , he would have spent hours on the details . I watched fun ' filling in landmarks , his aristocratic face tight with concentration . This was how my mother would look if my father managed to divine her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was ashamed of what I 'd done , or just unhappy that I had to care now . " What 's wrong ? " he asked , turning to look at me . Concern flowed off him in waves ; I could almost see the air shimmy with it . " Nothing , " I said . " Is the map done ? " He held it up . " Can you find your way from this ? " It looked like he 'd put in most of the major roads and a good many of the minor ones as well . " I can show the more heavily-settled areas ? " " That looks good . " I took the map from him , folded it up , and stuck it in my shirt pocket . " I want you to go back to your life . Can you do that ? " He shrugged . " I can keep working here , if that 's what you mean . " " What about anything else ? " He frowned . " What else is there ? Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll just close up and we can go now , if you want . " His Name might as well have been written all over his face  --  anyone with even a minor bump of knowledge could have Named him in the dark . " I do n't want you to go with me . I want you to stay here and go back the way you were . " " Oh ? And what are you going to do ? " he said bitterly . " Not know whatever you know ? " " What ? " I said . " You come in here and mess me up , and now you want it to be as if it never happened . Because it 's inconvenient for you , I guess . " He made a face at my puzzlement . " Oh , come on , did n't you realize I 'd know what happened ? Well , not exactly what , or even how  --  I did n't understand what you said  --  but I know what it did to me . I know what you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you in the world , but my shrink kept telling me it was just another facet of my neurosis , thinking that there were people walking around who could ... do things . Boileau 's one of them , too , is n't he ? All my life I 've been trying to get next to people like you . Even if it did n't rub off on me , I thought maybe I could reap some of the benefits , anyway . " Well , that explained how I 'd been able to divine his Name so easily . I could also see why my father had n't gotten to him first , even though he could have quite easily : Naming someone like this was obviously more trouble than it was worth . I 'd have to keep that in mind . " It 's not my fault you 've been standing around waiting to surrender to somebody , " I said after a bit . " So you should n't complain now that someone 's taken you up on it . But I 'm giving you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It wo n't be easy , but you can get the hang of it with practice . " He sneered . " It must he wonderful , to have life be so simple for you . No , it 's not your fault I was that way , but it does n't relieve you of responsibility for your own actions . " " I ' m not going to hang around here listening to a gallery manager lecture me on personal responsibility , " I said . " Forget what happened . Learn to cope . " He hesitated . " All right . But someone should have told you that even when you buy something you do n't want , you still have to pay for it . " I did n't like the sound of that , but I just wanted to get away from him and head my father off before he turned my mother into a lapdog . I made him give me directions to the ferry and left him sitting at his desk , doodling faces on the blank pages of his appointment book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a lived-in feeling to it . The feeling was all there was , at first . But as the boat plowed steadily through the water , I began to get flashes of the residents themselves . They were well-camouflaged , moving unnoticed among the passengers with ease but also with practiced caution . Some of them had been passengers themselves once , I realized . Just as an experiment , I bought several packages of chocolate cupcakes from the snack bar on the upper deck and then found an unoccupied bench facing the stern . I unwrapped a package , set it down next to me , and got up to stand at the railing and stare at the slowly-receding mainland . Only a minute later , I heard the open cellophane crackle , but I knew better than to turn around . " It 's not what I would have suggested , but it 's the thought that counts . " The voice came from below , not behind . I looked down ; two women were standing on the lower deck almost directly underneath where I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cellophane crackled some more , to let me know I had it right . " Well , I 've always said an offer is an offer . " The woman on the left sipped her coffee . " What do you want to do about it ? " " I do n't know , " said the woman on the right . " I guess I 'll have to hear the terms and conditions attached to it . " The wind came up suddenly ; they shuddered together and went back inside . " Think of it as a gift . " I spoke softly into the wind , letting it carry my voice back . " Or payment , in exchange for the use of your ... residence . " " I knew who it was right away , " said another voice . Now a man and a woman were standing on the deck below me , holding their collars closed against the wind . " You know how that is , when you get a call from someone you know of , but you have n't actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company itself for so long that I felt like I really had met everyone in it , so I had to remind myself that we were n't actually acquainted . " The woman 's murmur of agreement carried up to me quite clearly . " I really do n't find knowing someone personally to he any kind of definite advantage , " she said . " Sometimes , it even works the other way . I 've had people try using that to pressure me into doing what they want me to . They try using the personal to influence the business we 're doing . So I 've taken to keeping everything on a strictly business level , I do n't ask about their kids or their spouses or talk about my own life . " " It 's okay , " I said . " I did n't want anything . The cupcakes are yours , free and clear . " The cellophane rustled aggressively . I turned around just in time to see it be swept away by a sudden crosswind . It danced high in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sight . I found a long bench indoors on the lower deck and set another opened package of cupcakes next to me . This time , I slumped down and closed my eyes . It took a little longer , but the presence was more tangible ; the bench creaked and shifted a little . Amid the general noise and the rumble of the engines , the conversation that had been taking place behind me went from an unintelligible murmur to audible . " I can spot that kind a mile away , " an older woman was saying . " I 've been around long enough that nothing gets by me any more . " I smiled to myself , still keeping my eyes closed . " But they 're like anyone else , you know , they 're just people . Some of them are okay and some of them you have to watch out for . But , like anyone else , they all want something and do n't let anybody ever tell you different . Everybody in this world , no matter how good they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to remember that , and never fool yourself into thinking that anybody is ever doing anything one hundred percent for your benefit . Nobody 's going to do anything for anybody unless there 's something in it for them as well . " Ferry-boat philosophy , I thought , amused . Well , they were n't very good cupcakes , after all , so I probably should n't have expected much . There was a rustle of cellophane . I opened my eyes to find the empty package had been pushed close to me for disposal . I tried another bench indoors on the upper deck , away from the windows . This time I slipped my watch in between the cupcakes before pretending to take a nap . Over at the snackbar , the attendant was having a loud conversation with what must have been a ferry regular . " So I says to myself , ' Now , that 's more like it . Something real , that is n't just junk . ' You know ? " I could sense the regular nodding in agreement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CADIGAN  | really want so much , " the attendant went on . " 1 mean , if I wanted so much , would I he hanging around in a place like this , working my ass off ? Hell , no . But you want to know someone 's making an effort , that it means something to them , right ? " The regular said something about a token . " Yeah , well , I believe in stuff like that , a token of affection and esteem , all that stuff . So you know , now I know it matters . Enough , anyway . " I left the last three packages of cupcakes in various unobtrusive spots and wandered aimlessly around the ferry . Twice I overheard people thanking each other and once , someone saying , That does n't even begin to cover it and what took you so long anyway ? The clouds were lower and heavier by the time the ferry docked ; it was going to get dark early . Standing among the crowd waiting to be let off , I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checking her watch . She glanced up , caught my eye and turned her wrist slightly so I could see before lowering her arm . The crowd moved forward then and she seemed to move along with everyone else , but she never appeared on the dock . You 're a knower , my mother had said . The other part of that was knowing whether what I knew was at all useful , and I did n't know that yet . But I was pretty sure it would come to me eventually . The line of cars stretched a quarter-mile along the road running past my father 's house . He was giving a party . I had the guy I 'd bummed the ride from let me off near the last car and I walked back . A mailbox marked the path that led down the steep embankment to where the house sat on the shQre of the inlet . Very secluded and private , except there was no secret about where it was tonight . I could hear the party sounds before I reached the mailbox ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A little ways down , the path had been made into an outdoor staircase , each packed dirt step bordered with a branch . I hesitated on the first one ; below , the party had spread out of the house , all around the yard and down to the shore in spite of the coolness of the already-fading afternoon . Nicelydressed people , like something out of a high-class magazine ad . My guy had n't mentioned this ; I guess my father had n't considered him worth telling . Or maybe he 'd wanted to surprise me . My father , that is . He was expecting me ; the sense of it drifted up to me with the people 's voices , along with the force of his presence , faint at this distance but there nonetheless . When I got a little farther down the steps , he 'd sense my presence like a ripple crossing his own . My father , the spider . I turned away from the stairs and began making my way along the embankment through the brush and dead leaves until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I half-clinched , half-slid down the embankment , trying to be quiet and failing completely . Still , no one bothered to take a look around the hack and see what all the crunching and rustling was about . Either they all figured it was the indigenous wildlife or they could n't really hear it that well . The rear windows were high up and not terribly large , but the ledges were generous . Jumping , I caught the rough edge of the one farthest from the party noise , and there was enough room for me to rest my forearm on it and pull myself up . I was looking into my father 's studio . The easel holding my mother 's portrait stood in the center of the room , facing away from me toward the door . This was it , the big unveiling of the capstone of his career , if you could call thirteen paintings of one blurry woman a career . But being a knower himself , he 'd known exactly how to play it as an artistic obsession . He could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expand beyond the small local but lucrative scenes he 'd been cultivating here and there around the country . But this would do it for him , I realized . Like that other artist , Wyeth , with the Helga paintings . Helga ? If I could have seen the entire series right then , I would have known her Name immediately . The window was locked ; I broke one of the panes and managed to unlock it without severing any major blood vessels on the shards left in the frame . Pushing the window up and clambering inside seemed to take forever and left me with sore arm muscles . I was surprised that I could do it at all ; moving around vigorously was something else I 'd never engaged in much . The portrait was covered with a white linen cloth . I hesitated , holding one corner , and then slipped my hand underneath . The paint  --  acrylics ? oils ? Glidden 's rainy-day grey ? ? felt almost-sticky , as if it were a minute or so away from being completely dry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted it to be looked at . " I did n't turn around . " Besides , family should n't have to wait until the ceremonial unveiling . " He came over and put his hands on my shoulders . " Of course , if you want to wait , I wo n't insist , " he added . " When did you finish it ? " I asked , pulling my hand away from the painting . " Who says it 's finished ? " He tried to turn me around but I refused to move and he let go of me . " I thought I 'd show it tonight and get some comments on it before I did anything final to it . If , indeed , I need to , other than take a last look . " Yeah , sure , I thought . He walked around behind the easel and leaned on the top of the painting , PAT CADIGAN  | studying me . I raised my eyes to look at him . My mother had shown him to me but I was n't prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in person . I could see everything immediately and I reached for the cloth , intending to yank it off . He clapped a hand down over it , holding it in place . " Sorry  --  changed my mind . You 're a smart girl , " he said , almost approvingly . " Excuse me , woman . Though people your age are more children than not to me . It really is n't finished , you know ; I could n't finish it until I 'd met my daughter . I must say , I had thought you would look much more like her , so this is a pleasant surprise . You do n't seem to know , though , whether you came to try and stop me , or just to kill me . Why do n't you come out and meet the other guests while you 're thinking it over ? " He came around the easel and tucked my hand into the crook of his elbow . It was such a corny thing to do that I could n't help laughing . This seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , leading me through the house as if he were already parading in victory . The house itself was surprisingly shabby , the furniture faded , old , and worn . In the dining room , people stood around in clumps , picking at the enormous spread of carefullyarranged party food , hors d'oeuvres and deli-style cold-cuts , salad mixtures in big stoneware bowls , and bottle after bottle of champagne , standing in rows . They still reminded me of magazine-ad people ; I half-expected my father to regroup them more artfully . But he just introduced me around and those generic faces gave me generic smiles , expressed tasteful astonishment that Boileau had a daughter , and went back to their generic party discussions . " Pretty harmless group , " I said , as my father led me outside . " They do n't have the faintest idea , " my father said , handing me down the front steps . " Let me show you . " He went up to the nearest person , a blond , bearded man in conversation with a tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Henry , Monica , I 'd like you to meet my daughter . " Monica beamed while Henry hurriedly transferred a paper plate of potato salad to his other hand so he could shake hands with me . " Well , this is a surprise and a pleasure ! " he said heartily . " She 's come to put a stop to me , " my father said , giving me a sidelong glance . " Probably by driving a stake through my heart or something . " " Really , " said Monica . " And where did she go to school ? " " Wherever her mother chose to take her . Mostly bad public schools with no budgets and demoralized teachers , I imagine . " " Ah . My next-door neighbor 's kids all went there , " said Henry . " They seemed to enjoy it . Do you paint , also ? " he asked me . " Oh , my daughter has n't done much of anything for the last twentysome years , thanks to her mother . But now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do whatever she wants  --  enslave a few people , maybe win a 1 DIRTY WORK  | lottery or two under different names , of course- and possibly kill her mean old father this evening . " " Well , that 's what I understand from many people such as yourself , " Henry said congenially . " The children all tend to go off in other directions , and I guess that 's understandable , if you 'll pardon my saying so . " " No offense taken , " I said , and turned to my father . " They really do n't get it . " " None of them do , " my father said . " You could walk around here like the invisible woman , completely unnoticed , unless I called their attention to you . " I looked around suspiciously . " Have n't touched them , " he said . " If you want to know the truth , I 'm not so sure that most of them even have Names . They 're more like a herd of sheep , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since they were born . Since before they were born . They are their clothes , their cars , their jobs ; their things own them , not me . I could have them if I wanted , I suppose , but that can be more trouble than it 's worth . Right ? " Of course he had sensed what I 'd done at the gallery  --  all of his paintings were there , and they were as much of him as they were of my mother . He had n't thought I 'd know that , which was why he 'd changed his mind about letting me see his nearly-finished masterpiece . I wondered how he planned to finish it and show it now . He did n't seem concerned . We drifted through the crowd in the yard , meeting more of them . He continued to play his little conversation game , though to what purpose I did n't know . Maybe just because they were so willing and he was so able . Eventually , I noticed that the day had stopped darkening . The slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased and the party gabble had acquired a strangely muffled sound , as if it were coming from under a bell jar . People who had been wandering about the yard and going in and out of the house were now rooted to wherever they stood  --  without noticing , of course . " Timing , " my father said , cheerfully . " What you need in this business is a good sense of timing and for that you have to understand time itself . " " I thought you were a knower , not a timekeeper , " I said , taking a baconwrapped morsel off a plate held by a woman in black satin pajamas . " Knowers are multi-talented that way , " he said . " Don ' t eat that . Nothing ' s edible when it 's stuck between moments , it 'll be like chewing a lump of Styrofoam . " I put the hors d'oeuvre back on the plate . " What about them ? Are they still functioning ? " He nodded , looking at the quiet water . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | as they can be , which is enough for my purpose . " Ile turned his smile to me . " It 's finished , now , in case you did n't know . I 've been finishing it while I 've been walking around here with you . Now I know what I should see , what we should all see . Time to bring it out . " " I 've brought it out for you . " My mother was standing in the middle of the yard next to the easel , one hand resting gracefully along the top like a game-show hostess 's . Once the initial shock had passed , I knew I should n't have been surprised . Diverting him with me was the only way she could possibly have gotten close to him . " I 'm sure you meant to invite me , " she went on , smiling at the people standing around . " A great artist would never unveil a masterpiece without inviting the subject to be present . " He took a step toward her and she grabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Boileau , " she said . " You 've had all the fun up to now . Let me have the privilege of unveiling it . " The motion of her yanking the linen away lasted forever . The cloth flew up and out , its folds twisting and turning like a flower opening up before it sailed away . It was now a picture of the two of them . There was still only one subject but what my father had put into it of himself was now equally as obvious as my mother 's face and , consequently , her Name . You could n't see it without seeing both of them . Of course . My mother had n't been able to undo any of the last thirty years , so she had just done a little more . Someone began to applaud . It spread through the gathering ; they were all putting their plates and glasses down on the ground beside them and clapping their hands enthusiastically . Someone even whistled . My mother went to my father and pulled him over to the easel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then began to clap her own hands , slowly and deliberately , almost in his face . " Sometimes a-stalemate is the best victory you can hope for , " I heard her tell him over the ovation still going on around them . " Maybe that 's the only victory that really means anything for people like us . " She looked at me ; her smile was grim . " You remember that . You remember that you ca n't really Name Names without Naming yourself . " It was true , I saw , as she moved around behind the easel and continued applauding my father . You had to look really closely to see that it was not just a picture of the two of them but a family portrait of the three of us , but since most people did n't know about me , they 'd never quite see it in the right way . And my mother would go on making sure they did n't , as long as nobody ever spoke her Name . Especially me . I turned and ran up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car idling by  | the mailbox . " Need a lift ' ? " said the guy from the gallery . It was n't really a question . " Who 's minding the store ? " I asked him . He laughed . " You are . As if you did n't know . " They were out in force on the ferryboat this time , not bothering to hide themselves . I could n't get away from all the conversations taking place around me , even in the bathroom . It was n't chocolate cupcakes that they wanted . I considered it . My new friend  --  his name , I learned belatedly , was Gus , short for Augustus , and what had his parents been thinking of ? ? would n't be happy here , but he was n't going to be happy anywhere any more . That was n't his purpose in life . " Just think it over , " one woman was telling another on a nearby bench . " Of course , you ca n't take too long but that 's the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gus stay there while I went up to the upper deck . A group of kids , teen-agers , were comparing notes about some party they 'd all been to . " ... give anything for a system like that ... all that power ... " " ... more than I make in two months , maybe three ... " " ... everybody 'd always be hitting on you to come over and use it , though ... " " ... and the whole world wants to be your best friend . I du n no if I want best friends like that ... " " ... got to use it while you were there ... think it over ... " Big help . I went back down to the lower deck . Gus was gone . I thought one of them had gotten impatient and decided to force the issue , but then I found him standing outside near the stern . " Is that how it is ? " he said . " When we dock , you just walk off and I do n't ? That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a whole ferryboat and all the bad snacks you can stuff in your face ? " " Are you wearing a watch ? " I asked . " Yes . A Rolex . " " Give it to me . " I wrapped a ten-dollar bill around the wristband and left it on a bench . " My parents gave me that , " he said accusingly . " You can get another . I 'll buy you another . " " You 'll have to . I need things like that . It 's what I am , you know . " He smiled . " Yeah , I guess you do know . " I did . His Name stood for material things and status symbols , the acquisition of shiny stones and metals and pretty pictures . They owned him , the condition of my ownership , for as long as it was in force . He was going  | to be an expensive pet ; I 'd have to win a lottery or two . I could feel him settling into his new life . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had power , you ended up having to depend on it . Eventually , like anything else , it owned you . Eventually ? No , from the beginning ; we just do n't bother admitting it at first . We were close to the mainland now and would be docking in a few minutes . Gus linked arms with me and dragged me into the middle of the crowd gathering impatiently at the exit . " I do n't like to wait in line , either , " he said . " I like to go first . " He put his arms around my shoulders and gave me a hard squeeze . " You know , I 'm going to like this a lot better than I thought I would . " I smiled up at him . " Behave yourself . " " Or what  --  you 'll bring me back here and leave me ? " He laughed . " No , " I said . " I 'll tell you my Name . " It was a month before he dared to speak again . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Naming Names , " I knew that I 'd be seeing these people again , and when Richard Gilliam asked me if I 'd be interested in contributing to Grails , which he was editing with Ed Kramer and Martin H. Greenburg , I knew where . The Holy Grail is another atypical subject for me and one that I had to learn about . If you finish knowing more than you started out with , you 've definitely come out ahead . On the other hand , when you cut a deal with God , maybe the best you can hope for is coming out even . w  | My new acquisition and I took the slow way home from Seattle . I think it was slow . It might as well have been home . In fact , I had no idea how fast I could move with my new prize . Just because I had come by it carelessly was no reason to treat it carelessly , after all . It was breakable , as are most things you get from art galleries , the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as I 'd rented the car , I knew I 'd done right . It was large , similar to the sedans and town cars I 'd driven back and forth to the airport in my old job . I set my prize next to me on the luxurious bench seat , pointed the nose of the car more or less toward the southeast and pressed the accelerator until I reached a comfortable cruising speed . After that , a car will practically drive itself , if it and the driver are any good . My last job had been like any other time-filling bill-payer but I 'd liked it better than most ; while I was driving , I could think all I wanted . Now , with the miles rolling away under the wheels , I went through my mental trunks and cases and crates , reconsidering everything . Most people would have called it a mid-life crisis , but in terms of living actually accomplished , I was really much closer to the beginning than the middle , thirty or not . I suppose I could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but first , I 'd have had to figure out who to be madder at , my mother or my father . Then being mad itself would have taken energy and attention that I could put to better use elsewhere , especially with this new acquisition to look after . My new acquisition , yes ; I contemplated it with mixed feelings . Some e  | things are beautiful because that 's their nature and purpose they 're supposed to he beautiful and when you look at them you 're meant to he glad that there are beautiful things in the world . Then there are other things that are beautiful because of what they mean  --  you look at them to remind yourself that there 's still innocence or generosity or some other goodness in the world ; it 's a long list , take your pick . ( It might not be true , but that 's something altogether different . ) My new acquisition was , as I 've said , strictly ornamental , art for art 's sake , beauty for beauty 's sake . Any deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up but on the whole , I tend to think it 's generally best not to overburden anything breakable . Sometimes I joked with myself that I 'd have to be much more careful from now on about going into art galleries and similar places . Then I 'd wonder if I were really done paying for this ornament to my own vanity , and if that was really all it could be : a trophy . And a voice in my mind that sounded not quite like my mother and not quite like me would say , If you wanted medicine , you should have gone to a pharmacy . But was medicine what I was looking for ? Sometimes things do n't become apparent right away ; it might even be years before you understand why you made some choice and why it was right , or wrong , or of no significance whatsoever . Most people find that last so horrible a prospect that they go around imbuing anything and everything with meaning . Even incorrect meaning is better than admitting your life makes no real difference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very human tendency made me think twice about having any grand notions about my new ornament . In spite of all that I know and all I can do , I 'm very human , no more and no less , and my mistakes would all come out of those very no-more-and-no-less human motivations . Needing more time to think , I slowed the pace even more by taking a more circuitous route toward home ... " home " being defined as my most recent address . Might as well have been home , yes ; a place that , unlike Seattle , could provide some past and a little context for my new acquisition , who seemed completely amenable . But of course whatever I wanted to do was fine ; all things considered , he could now live completely in the present and for the moment , not for what had happened six months ago or what might happen next year . The self-imposed vow of temporary silence did n't hurt his tractability . I still marveled at how easily I had divined his Name in Seattle . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in my mind like two animals chasing each others ' tails : Anything cheap is worth what you pay for it and Cheap is dear in the long run . At least he did n't look cheap  --  quite the opposite . But then , think of an PAT CADIGAN i  | art gallery and who you 'd expect to find in charge : Michelangelo 's David with a good haircut and designer clothes , perhaps . I would n't have gone that far in describing my prize , but he was pretty enough to be anybody 's ornament . After all , that had been the role he 'd chosen for himself long before I had come along to Name him and claim him . It occurred to me belatedly as we rolled down Route 84 with a fine grey mist blowing over everything like rags in a wind that the whole thrust of his life had been to await my moment of impulsiveness . From here on , it was my show and I 'd learn much of what I needed to know by taking care of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of learning on a smaller scale . I was smiling about that when everything went wrong . There was a period of time I experienced as a series of jump-cut freezeframes , except it was n't just visual . I could hear strange , distorted voices calling to each other while cold mist drifted over my face and wet my lips , but I could see nothing . Then I could see : someone 's feet running toward me while the moisture on the pavement splashed up and out , but I could feel nothing . And then there was something hanging above me that , after a long time or no time at all , resolved itself into my new acquisition 's face , concerned and helpless : I could feel broken bones waiting for shock to wear off , and a hard pressure against the side of my head , but I could hear nothing . Vision went away again ; there was a sensation of rising up , or starting to , and then nothing at all . When awareness came back , I was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for departure , it was all fixable . I wondered if my mother and father would know , whether my damage could raise a blip within the stand-off that was their life together , or whether holding each other at bay kept them too engaged to know about anything else . Not that it would have mattered . You go to the healing place the same way you come into the world or go out of it , and you stay as long as you have to and hope that the healing time does n't get too out of joint with your outside living time . It seemed like a century before I could do even that  --  i.e. , hope . There was so much wreckage . Eventually , I began to feel more gathered , more focused . The light in the healing place became less scattered as I progressed toward a more coherent state of existence ; random sensation resolved itself into sequences of real things . I became reacquainted with the feelings that indicated the presence of my ornament , his physical proximity as well as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , some of them standing out more sharply from the texture of the background than others . They exerted DIRTY WORK  | a subtle pull , as all living things will . Life calls to life , and power to power , as my mother had told me . Warned me . At first , I thought it was just a particularly strong life calling to my own , and then I thought it might he my mother , suddenly made aware and coming to see if she could help . But as my senses recovered their sharpness , I realized that the power was n't there with me in the healing place , or even in the immediate vicinity . It was somewhere back in the world that I had temporarily stepped out of . Some impressive force , I thought , to have an effect on me in the healing place without actually being there with me . If it was that powerful , it had to leave a trail . I found it easily enough , but before I could pinpoint the source , I woke up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those cheap frame-and-cushion chairs next to the bed , a well-worn flannel blanket thrown over him . His head was resting on his left shoulder at an angle that was comfortable only when you were unconscious . He was going to wake up stiff , I thought ; the least I could do was rouse him so he could shift position . I started to call out to him when the door to the room swung open . At first , I thought it was a nurse 's flashlight shining directly into my eyes , blinding me . But even as it moved from the doorway to the foot of my bed , it did n't get any less blinding . And then there was the silence  --  not just the quiet of late night in a hospital but a complete absence of any sound , no rustle of clothing , no soft pad-and-squeak of rubber soles on antiseptic floor , not even the distant hum of fluorescents burning all night . I got out of bed . My acquisition went on sleeping without so much as a twitch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the light . This was not a flashlight 's canned beam ; it was more like something alive . Shielding my eyes as well as I could , I padded after it barefoot in one of those too ventilated hospital gowns . Whoever was carrying it did n't have a steady hand  --  the light moved with a kind of bobbing motion , like something floating on a wave in a calm ocean . Suddenly , I could see again ; the light had moved behind the curtain drawn around the other bed in the room . Now , there was something I had n't thought of  --  that there would be someone else in the room  --  although it made sense . Strangers brought in off the highway did n't usually get private hospital rooms with round-the-clock nursing attention , especially if they were n't carrying anything to prove they were insured . I was probably fortunate not to find myself stacked like cordwood in some crowded basement charity ward . In any case , my first impulse was not to violate my roommate 's privacy PAT CADIGAN 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtain became all but diaphanous . I had no trouble seeing the old woman sitting up in the bed or the dish she was reaching for . Maybe it was more of a platter , since it looked much larger than a dinner plate and the edge curved up a little more sharply . It was easy to see that , too , because there was nobody holding it  --  it was just floating there over the side of the woman 's bed and she was reaching for it with the casualness of someone who did this every night . I held my breath , hoping I could tiptoe back to bed without her hearing me . Talk about secret people and their secrets , I thought , feeling slightly giddy . When my mother had explained about secret people and strange worlds , had she been thinking about something like this ? Or was this something else I was privy to as a knower ? The old woman removed something round and white , about the size of an old-fashioned silver dollar and held it carefully between the thumbs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete , but I could see her lips moving . Ritual . Praying ? She put the thing in her mouth and it clicked for me then . The communion rite . I had never participated in any form of it , but I got the gist . Except this particular version was not really an act of faith ; this woman knew what she was getting out of it . And what she was n't getting . I wanted to know , too , but apparently this was n't one of those things I could just know , and I could n't exactly barge in on her and ask her what she was up to . They were around me and past me before I even knew they were in the room , two nurses and a doctor moving quickly but unhurriedly . Not that I could have hidden or anything , but to my surprise , they ignored me as if I were n't even there . One of the nurses pulled the curtain partially aside while the doctor stepped around the floating dish/platter to carry something to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the bed and unrolled thick strips of some kind of cloth , laying them out next to the woman on top of the covers . The curtain in front of me had not been moved , so I was still watching everything through it and wondering how they could all see what they were doing . The way they moved had the feeling of routine  --  maybe they 'd done this so often , they did n't actually need to see any more to do it ? The nurse who had pulled the curtain moved to the foot of the bed , blocking my view ; at the same time , the light began to damp down from blinding to merely bright . What the hell , I thought ; if I were going to be this nosy , I might as well take it the whole way . I stepped around the curtain just in time to see the doctor unroll the towel she had placed on the tray table and remove the lance . Still no one paid attention to me , not even the old woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as profound as the silence  | still in force . I was mildly shocked to see that she had a tracheotomy tube coming out of her neck , like someone in a coma , a detail that had n't been visible through the curtain . The nurse on her left was turning back the sleeves of her hospital gown to expose her forearms . I figured I knew what was coming next , but what I really wanted to know was why . And why no one cared that I was standing there watching . The doctor held up the lance . It was actually more like a broken-off spear and nothing at all like a surgical instrument . The doctor 's elegant hands seemed to emphasize its brutal quality , even though she was treating it as if it were something fragile . Or sacred . The nurse on the other side of the bed bowed his head with unmistakable reverence , averting his eyes as he lifted the old woman 's forearm for the doctor . The tip of the lance or spear pressed against the flesh just under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way through and out the other side . I had expected the blood to spurt . Instead , it flowed out gently into the dish/platter , which had obligingly come down into position to catch it . The doctor had averted her eyes now , too , along with the nurse at the foot of the bed , while the old woman stared into space , not watching but not deliberately looking away , either . Her expression suggested a state of transport or rapture . Only I was watching now , and if they were n't going to try to stop me or force me out of the room , I was going to continue . The woman 's blood kept flowing into the dish , enough that it should have spilled over onto the sheets , except that it did n't . An unmeasured time later , as if in response to some hidden cue , the doctor pulled the lance out . The blood stopped immediately . The old woman seemed to rouse from a waking dream and offered the arm to the nurse , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fact that there were no marks , no scars , not even a scratch to show where the lance had pierced her . They went through the whole thing again with the old woman 's other arm , lasting a little longer , I thought ; or perhaps not . It was hard to tell . In that persistent silence , something funny seemed to have happened to time anyway . Not to mention space , or at least the part defined by the dish . There was still no overflow , not so much as a drop spilling over the side , and yet I could see the surface of the blood collected in it , reflecting the old woman 's face like a red mirror . This time the doctor pulled the lance out and left it on the dish , which then floated upward as if to deliberately move itself out of the way . No one looked at it . The nurse on the woman 's left removed the blood pressure cuff from the wall and wrapped it around her upper arm while the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all very ordinary except for the dish hovering in mid-air with the lance lying in it .. And the silence , which was really beginning to bother me . Was this the only way I could witness this ritual , to see it but not hear anything ? And what kind of ritual was it  --  a healing ritual , or a blood offering to an especially obscure medical demigod , or something else I could n't imagine at all ? The dish began to glow more brightly again ; in a minute , the light would be blinding . The doctor lifted her hands to it and it floated down into them . She picked up the lance and held it close to her face . A bead of blood was shining on the point . The doctor touched her thumb to it and then used the same thumb to trace a triangle on the old woman 's forehead . The woman closed her eyes and collapsed against the raised bed , unconscious , as the doctor turned away to wrap the lance in the towel on the tray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nurse bent over to kiss the top of her head . Nice , I thought , taking a good look at him for the first time . This certainly gave a new dimension to personal care . Then I noticed the doctor was looking at him as well , in an expectant way . The nurse shrugged and turned to the nurse at the foot of the bed , who was making some notes on a patient chart . Not being able to hear them was frustrating , as was having them ignore me so thoroughly . I had to remember the ignoring trick , I thought ; under the right circumstances , it could be quite effective ... The dish began moving away from the bed , leaving the room exactly the same way it had come in . The light it gave off was blinding but I managed to see a little more this time . I tried to touch it as it passed but it eluded my fingers and sailed out into the hall . A moment later , as I tried to readjust my vision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door shut behind him . His back was pretty nice , too . My ornament shifted in his chair but did n't wake . Little man , you 've had a busy day ? And more than one of those , by the look of him . His sleeping face had no real repose in it , as if all his troubles had followed him into unconsciousness so he could wrestle with them in his dreams . Which was exactly how things were with him , no doubt . But what else could the poor boy do ? Just wait and hope for the best , of course , but it could n't be easy for him . I still owned him , even unconscious . " It 'll be okay now , " I said to him . Or tried to . I sensed my voice , but I could n't actually hear it . Oh , Christ , I thought , irritated ; would n't you know that the accident would have deafened me . Well , it was n't as if I could n't reverse it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . I started to get back into bed and then saw it was occupied . There was a moment of confusion  --  wishful disorientation , I 'd guess  --  in which I thought I 'd gotten all turned around and I was back on the old woman 's side of the room . But it was n't the old woman in that bed . It was me.  | Well , that explained the silence , I thought , staring at myself . I did n't look good . Of course , the tracheotomy tube did n't help appearances , even if it was letting me breathe more easily . My body tended to shudder and sigh on the exhalations , as if I were suffering for every breath . It was n't peaceful , like the old woman . No wonder the ornament looked so upset , even in sleep . I was n't able to tell him there was no suffering , no discomfort . Not even any sound , just nothing . Nothing ? Was that really true , I thought suddenly , or was there nothing only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . And , come to that , why was n't I ? If I was n't in the healing place any more , I had no reason to be anywhere else but within the corporeal . Maybe I 'd slipped out inadvertently when that strange dish had floated in  --  power called to power , and all that . It made sense . So all I 'd have to do would be to figure out how to slip back in again . Maybe retracing my steps would do it . I tried , moving as if I were still corporeal and it was all just a matter of getting back into bed again after all . It did n't work . I could sense the body around me like a strong electrical or magnetic field , but I was n't in it . A matter of concentration , I decided hopefully , and I was concentrating hard and heavy when the nurse came in and exposed the feeding tube in my stomach . It was a different nurse , and she was just making sure I was clean , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube , I went crazy . It was n't any worse than seeing a tube coming out of my neck , though of course it was n't any easier , either . I think it was just that the two of them together were too much . I ran back and forth screaming and yelling  --  or I would have been screaming and yelling if I could have made a sound  --  while the nurse bent over me and my ornament shifted again in the chair , still looking troubled . After a bit  --  quite a bit , I think  --  I pulled myself together , ashamed at being so squeamish over my own body and found that the ornament had woken up and was talking with the nurse . No  --  he was listening while the nurse talked to him . The ornament did have a name : Gus , short for Augustus . Gus the ornament . Right . If I could remember , that had to mean I was n't really gone . Naturally , I could n't hear a thing the nurse was saying to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just an exercise in frustration . But at least I could see by her face that she was being kind , while Gus was being polite . Not yet the totally helpless lump he would become if I did n't find out how to slip back into my life soon . She beckoned to him . He got up and leaned over me , taking my hand and stroking it . Trying to pull me back . I wanted to run up and down screaming and yelling again . Power calls to power , Gus , I thought sourly . Power pulls PAT CADIGAN  | power . Get me some of that stuff you slept through and then try meAnd suddenly , I felt him touching me . Or almost felt him . It was like feeling the faint vibration of a radio running on the last drop of juice in a used-up battery , just before it dies altogether . I tried to seize the feel of him and hang onto it , build a bridge out of a thread , but there just was n't enough . Power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him bent over my inert form and found myself standing next to the old woman 's bed . She was slumped against the raised portion of the mattress , eyes closed ; her bandaged arms made her look like a failed suicide . There was no trace of the triangle the doctor had drawn on her forehead with her own blood . I began to wonder if I 'd dreamed or hallucinated the whole thing as part of the situation I was in . Then she opened her eyes and looked at me with that same expression of benign serenity . Shocked , I waved both hands in front of her face to see if she was really looking at me . She did n't draw back but her expression faded slightly , as if my actions had unsettled her . She did n't see me , I realized , but she sensed me ... sensed something , at least . I tried touching her and that unsettled us both . It was as if I were oil and she were water , with a layer of plastic wrap between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little while , I fumbled around while she sat looking bewildered . Then she reached for the drawer on the night stand . There was a pen , but the only paper was a box of tissues . The felt-tip pen would n't write on the box , and made big blotches on the tissues . She gave up and wrote on the sheet in big , unsteady letters : DR . GOWAN YOU It was meant to help . I just was n't sure how . I moved back to my own bed . Gus was still standing beside me , holding my hand and stroking it from the palm out to each finger . And I tried , very hard , but I could n't feel a thing . The pinpoint swelled gradually to a brilliant , deep red bead . For a moment , it hung distended from the point of the lance ; then it fell heavily into the tube the doctor was holding . No one held the lance . It floated above the table in the lab , a sight that would have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . Hell of a lot of floating equipment in this hospital , I thought , watching another drop of blood form on the tip of the lance . Well , all right , only two things , a dish and a lance , but that was probably two more than any other hospital in the country . The dish was nowhere to be seen , or sensed ; the power was concentrated in the lance now . Or rather , the power was concentrated in the blood that came drop by drop out of the point . Gowan and the two nurse accomplices flanking her  | watched intently . The woman on her left had a rack of empty tubes they apparently hoped to fill ; in front of the man was a rack empty except for one tube , capped , labeled , and half-full . It was a slow process but nobody was in a hurry . The nurses had the look of people who were equally prepared to wait hours or days . Gowan 's face showed the same feelings mixed with a kind of urging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . It 's the kind of expression you see on the faces of people who believe that their prayers can be answered if they say them right . Except Gowan was n't praying ; like the old woman in my room , she knew . It was n't faith , but hope  --  hope that the power , whatever it was , would choose to work for her . As the lance continued to bleed , I could sense the slowness of the process extending outward ; as long as the lance was active , time in the hospital passed more slowly , and not at the same rate in every location  --  it was slowest here and in the immediate vicinity , and dissipated farther away . Somehow it would all even out later , though probably no one would notice . Time always seemed warped in hospitals . It slowed even more with each drop that welled up from that point , I realized . As each drop fell , I could see it shake within itself the way things will do when seen in extreme slow motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathed was all but imperceptible , their eyes like unseeing glass . I thought of my body lying in that room elsewhere in the hospital , Gus running his fingertips along my palm , the old woman sitting up in her bed , and outside in the hall , a different nurse plodding to the desk at the nurses ' station , caught in a shift that seemed endless . Only I was outside the effect . Correction : only I and Gowan . Her eyes gave her away ; she blinked slowly , but not slowly enough . It was n't humanly possible to move that slowly , and when I realized , I wondered why she was bothering , what she hoped it would do . I moved in close to her , studying her nondescript , middle-aged face . She looked like anybody , everybody , somebody . Not a secret person , but someone who had become privy to a realm of secret people and had to deal with it , because there was no one else to do it . Her Name should have become known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . That was disturbing . I had n't really been looking to divine it , and I certainly did n't want to say it , but the fact that it was obscured from me meant that quite a lot was out of kilter , at least where I was concerned , and it would n't be put right until I got back into my body and woke up . For that to happen , I realized , I needed some of that blood . And as soon as I realized that , I also realized that Gowan could see me . Not see , exactly , but perceive , I amended . Gowan could perceive that I PAT CADICAN  | was there . Only I was n't supposed to know . But why not ? I wondered , as another drop of blood swelled so slowly that it was literally painful to watch , even with nothing that could feel any literal pain . The drop took hours to detach from the point , days to splash down in the tube in the doctor 's hand . Gowan did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had produced as much as it could for now : three tubes , counting the one she was still holding . Not a lot of return considering how much blood they 'd taken from the old woman sharing my room , perhaps half a pint , total  --  but , I was sure , very potent . And now , who would get it ? Who would benefit ? I could tell this was a familiar dilemma for Gowan as she finally capped the tube and put it in the mostly empty rack with the other two . She pulled a clean white towel out of a drawer under the table and raised it to the lance , cradling it for a few moments before wrapping it up . I felt the change in the power ; suddenly it was n't floating any more , and she was carrying it to a cabinet across the room . I had a glimpse of the dish as she put the lance on the shelf next to it . The two nurses had n't moved ; they were still caught in the slow-down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed a handful of disposable syringes and then stuck the three tubes of blood in the breast pocket of her jacket . At least they did n't float , too , I thought as I followed her out . I 'd known that she was going to visit the children 's ward . Half the contents of one tube went into an IV connected to a too-skinny three-yearold , asleep or comatose . After a long period of pacing through the ward , the rest went to a husky ten-year-old with a head injury . Caught in the temporal slowdown , no one there noticed ; from their perspective , Gowan probably had n't been there long enough to register visually . Time was moving a little faster in the intensive care unit , but then I imagined that was probably true normally . Time was something nobody had much of in intensive care . After considerable thought , Gowan passed up one cardiac case and dosed another in the next room . That took an entire tube , leaving one . My room was on the next floor up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs . I know you know I 'm here , I thought at her as she pushed along , pretending she felt nothing . I know what you can do ; please help me . Pretending was a serious effort now . Her forehead wrinkled unhappily as her gaze came to rest on me , or whatever she perceived of me . It 'll work . Just help me get out of here and no one will ever know about any of this . She stopped at the door leading to the stairs and leaned against the wall  | with a weariness I could practically feel as a tremor in the ether . The elegant hands covered her face for a moment and then smoothed back her graying brown hair as she looked up at the exit sign over the door . " Nobody knows , " she whispered to the sign . " Nobody knows . Even my nurses forget afterwards , until I need them again . It 's a deal with God . Make your own deal . We all have to . " She shoved through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of going after her to work on her some more . It was the last thing I thought about for a while . I came back to awareness in my hospital room . Not a bit like waking up ; more like a switch flipped from off to on . I was looking up at Gus from a vantage point somewhere near the floor . He was asleep in that chair again , the blanket rumpled and probably smelly as well  --  he looked like he needed a bath . He also looked like he was n't going to get one until I woke up . And if I never woke up ? How big a tragedy would that be , I wondered . Subtracting one secret person would leave a remainder of : one helpless possession who would probably spend the rest of his life sleeping on sidewalk grates . Anything else ? Two parents , but they were so busy with each other I doubted they 'd become aware of my absence for a long time . So , what else , then ? Could I honestly say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't in it ? This universe , at least ? The universe does n't suffer from a lack of anyone ; I did n't have to prove it needed me , I just had to want to be in it badly enough to stick . Which meant making sure someone else wanted that as much as I did . Or even , if possible , more . Years from now , I 'll tell someone the story of how Lassie saved me from drowning , I thought , concentrating . Gus woke with a start and looked over at the bed where my body was still huffing and sighing . I did call your name , but not from there . The uneasy expression on his face deepened as he sat up straighter and looked around . Wait , I thought at him , it gets weirder . If I 'd told him to wait for Armageddon , he would have started doing crossword puzzles . This was n't supposed to take quite as long . After an hour of nothing but waiting , I was the impatient one ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not knowing what . Power calls to power : come in , power . Nothing . I thought of the old woman in the next bed and then , like before , found myself beside her . She was unconscious , lying back against the raised PAT CADI  --  AN U  | mattress as if she had been tossed there and forgotten . The covers were jumbled around her hands , but I thought I could see bruises on her wrists in the semi-dark . Perhaps they were just shadows . Wait , I told Gus again  --  needlessly , but it made me feel better  --  and went in search of Dr. Gowan . She was alone in her little laboratory domain , passed out on a roll-away cot . This was the goddamnedest hospital , I thought ; what was n't levitating was unconscious . Or comatose , like me . I knew what she was trying to do ? apparently , she had much less understanding of the power than I 'd realized . Seriously disapprove , doctor . This wo n't damp the power , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed you , not in a way that called for a miracle but just some plain old medicine to practice , what then ? The sense of my thoughts reached her where she had taken herself . She could n't bring herself back , of course and that just about summed up humans for me : once they get anywhere , they 're through . Goes double for secret people , said a voice in my mind suddenly . Test it out sometime . Not right now , thanks all the same . I hovered over the doctor on the narrow cot , concentrating until her trail became visible to me and I could follow . I think it comes of the human condition  --  the modern human condition , anyway  --  that when humans are actually able to go elsewhere , they usually have to be incapacitated by some kind of drug so potent as to be toxic to them . And rather than finding their way to one of their superficial notions of paradise , they somehow instinctively head for exile in the dead ends of nowhere . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of as nowhere . She had n't bothered to visualize her idea ; it reminded me of being under a restaurant-style covered-dish . Or maybe hospital-style was more like it , considering the circumstances . She knew me right away , but it took a little while to get past her pretending she was too poisoned/intoxicated to perceive or understand . That was embarrassing for her as I 'd known it would be but I could n't allow her to indulge in her feelings about being caught in a blatant lie . Time to sober up , straighten out , and come home , Dr. Gowan . I can guarantee your miracle will work for me . I want to go home and live my life . I need to find home and figure out what my life is , I ca n't do that with a tube in my throat and another in my stomach . Nowhere became Dr. Gowan as a good setting will show off a gem . Because it was n't just nowhere , I realized , but Entropy itself , and Dr.
