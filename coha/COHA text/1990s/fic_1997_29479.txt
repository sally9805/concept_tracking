Chapter One Death is my beat . I make my living from it . I forge my professional reputation on it . I treat it with the passion and precision of an undertaker-somber and sympathetic about it when I 'm with the bereaved , a skilled craftsman with it when I 'm alone . I 've always thought the secret of dealing with death was to keep it at arm 's length . That 's the rule . Do n't let it breathe in your face . But my rule did n't protect me . When the two detectives came for me and told me about Sean , a cold numbness quickly enveloped me . It was like I was on the other side of the aquarium window . I moved as if underwater-back and forth , back and forth-and looked out at the rest of the world through the glass . From the backseat of their car I could see my eyes in the rearview mirror , flashing each time we passed beneath a streetlight . I recognized the thousand-yard stare I had seen in the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew only one of the two detectives . Harold Wexler . I had met him a few months earlier when I stopped into the Pints Of for a drink with Sean . They worked CAPs together on the Denver PD . I remember Sean called him Wex . Cops always use nicknames for each other . Wexler 's is Wex , Sean 's , Mac . It 's some kind of tribal bonding thing . Some of the names are n't complimentary but the cops do n't complain . I know one down in Colorado Springs named Scoto whom most other cops call Scroto . Some even go all the way and call him Scrotum , but my guess is that you have to be a close friend to get away with that . Wexler was built like a small bull , powerful but squat . A voice slowly cured over the years by cigarette smoke and whiskey . A hatchet face that always seemed red the times I saw him . I remember he drank Jim Beam over ice . I 'm always interested in what cops drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking it straight like that , I always think that maybe they 've seen too many things too many times that most people never see even once . Sean was drinking Lite beer that night , but he was young . Even though he was the supe of the CAPs unit , he was at least ten years younger than Wexler . Maybe in ten years he would have been taking his medicine cold and straight like Wexler . But now I 'll never know . I spent most of the drive out from Denver thinking about that night at the Pints Of . Not that anything important had happened . It was just drinks with my brother at the cop bar . And it was the last good time between us , before Theresa Lofton came up . That memory put me back in the aquarium . But during the moments that reality was able to punch through the glass and into my heart , I was seized by a feeling of failure and grief . It was the first real tearing of the soul I had experienced in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was too young then to properly grieve for Sarah or even to understand the pain of a life unfulfilled . I grieved now because I had not even known Sean was so close to the edge . He was Lite beer while all the other cops I knew were whiskey on the rocks . Of course , I also recognized how self-pitying this kind of grief was . The truth was that for a long time we had n't listened much to each other . We had taken different paths . And each time I acknowledged this truth the cycle of my grief would begin again . * * * My brother once told me the theory of the limit . He said every homicide cop had a limit but the limit was unknown until it was reached . He was talking about dead bodies . Sean believed that there were just so many that a cop could look at . It was a different number for every person . Some hit it early . Some put in twenty in homicide and never got close . But there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it . You transferred to records , you turned in your badge , you did something . Because you just could n't look at another one . And if you did , if you exceeded your limit , well , then you were in trouble . You might end up sucking down a bullet . That 's what Sean said . * * * I realized that the other one , Ray St. Louis , had said something to me . He turned around in his seat to look back at me . He was much larger than Wexler . Even in the dim light of the car I could make out the rough texture of his pockmarked face . I did n't know him but I 'd heard him referred to by other cops and I knew they called him Big Dog . I had thought that he and Wexler made the perfect Mutt and Jeff team when I first saw them waiting for me in the lobby at the Rocky . It was like they had stepped out of a late-night movie . Long , dark overcoats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white . " You hear me , Jack . We 'll break it to her . That 's our job , but we 'd just like you to be there to sort of help us out , maybe stay with her if it gets rough . You know , if she needs to be with somebody . Okay ? " " Okay . " " Good , Jack . " We were going to Sean 's house . Not the apartment he split with four other cops in Denver so in accordance with city regs he was a Denver resident . His house in Boulder where his wife , Riley , would answer our knock . I knew nobody was going to be breaking anything to her . She 'd know what the news was the moment she opened the door and saw the three of us standing there without Sean . Any cop 's wife would know . They spend their lives dreading and preparing for that day . Every time there 's a knock on the door they expect it to be death 's messengers standing there when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know , she 's going to know , " I told them . " Probably , " Wexler said . " They always do . " I realized they were counting on Riley knowing the score as soon as she opened the door . It would make their job easier . I dropped my chin to my chest and brought my fingers up beneath my glasses to pinch the bridge of my nose . I realized I had become a character in one of my own stories-exhibiting the details of grief and loss I worked so hard to get so I could make a thirty-inch newspaper story seem meaningful . Now I was one of the details in this story . A sense of shame descended on me as I thought of all the calls I had made to a widow or parent of a dead child . Or brother of a suicide . Yes , I had even made those . I do n't think there was any kind of death that I had n't written about , that had n't brought me around as the intruder into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words for a reporter . Always the first question . If not so direct , then carefully camouflaged in words meant to impart sympathy and understanding-feelings I did n't actually have . I carried a reminder of this callousness . A thin white scar running along my left cheek just above the line of my beard . It was from the diamond engagement ring of a woman whose fianc had been killed in an avalanche near Breckenridge . I asked her the old standby and she responded with a backhand across my face . At the time I was new to the job and thought I had been wronged . Now I wear the scar like a badge . " You better pull over , " I said . " I 'm going to be sick . " Wexler jerked the car into the freeway 's breakdown lane . We skidded a little on the black ice but then he got control . Before the car had completely stopped I tried desperately to open the door but the handle would n't work . It was a detective car , I realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back were suspects and prisoners . The back doors had security locks controlled from the front . " The door , " I managed to strangle out . The car finally jerked to a stop as Wexler disengaged the security lock . I opened the door , leaned out and vomited into the dirty slush . Three great heaves from the gut . For a half a minute I did n't move , waiting for more , but that was it . I was empty . I thought about the backseat of the car . For prisoners and suspects . And I guessed that I was both now . Suspect as a brother . A prisoner of my own pride . The sentence , of course , would now be life . Those thoughts quickly slipped away with the relief the physical exorcism brought . I gingerly stepped out of the car and walked to the edge of the asphalt where the light from the passing cars reflected in moving rainbows on the petroleum-exhaust glaze on the February snow . It looked as if we had stopped alongside a grazing meadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been paying attention to how far along to Boulder we were . I took off my gloves and glasses and put them in the pockets of my coat . Then I reached down and dug beneath the spoiled surface to where the snow was white and pure . I took up two handfuls of the cold , clean powder and pressed it to my face , rubbing my skin until it stung . " You okay ? " St. Louis asked . He had come up behind me with his stupid question . It was up there with How do you feel ? I ignored it . " Let 's go , " I said . We got back in and Wexler wordlessly pulled the car back onto the freeway . I saw a sign for the Broomfield exit and knew we were about halfway there . Growing up in Boulder , I had made the thirty-mile run between there and Denver a thousand times but the stretch seemed like alien territory to me now . For the first time I thought of my parents and how they would deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . They never discussed it . They moved on . They 'd done it with Sarah . Now they 'd do it with Sean . " Why 'd he do it ? " I asked after a few minutes . Wexler and St. Louis said nothing . " I 'm his brother . We 're twins , for Christ 's sake . " " You 're also a reporter , " St. Louis said . " We picked you up because we want Riley to be with family if she needs it . You 're the only- " " My brother fucking killed himself ! " I said it too loud . It had a quality of hysteria to it that I knew never worked with cops . You start yelling and they have a way of shutting down , going cold . I continued in a subdued voice . " I think I am entitled to know what happened and why . I 'm not writing a fucking story . Jesus , you guys are ... " I shook my head and did n't finish . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazed out the window and could see the lights of Boulder coming up . So many more than when I was a kid . " We do n't know why , " Wexler finally said after a half minute . " Okay ? All I can say is that it happens . Sometimes cops get tired of all the shit that comes down the pipe . Mac might 've gotten tired , that 's all . Who knows ? But they 're working on it . And when they know , I 'll know . And I 'll tell you . That 's a promise . " " Who 's working on it ? " " The park services turned it over to our department . SIU is handling it . " " What do you mean Special Investigations ? They do n't handle cop suicides . " " Normally , they do n't . We do . CAPs . But this time it 's just that they 're not going to let us investigate our own . Conflict of interest , you know . " CAPs , I thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide . I wondered who would be listed in the reports as the person against whom this crime had been committed . Riley ? Me ? My parents ? My brother ? " It was because of Theresa Lofton , was n't it ? " I asked , though it was n't really a question . I did n't feel I needed their confirmation or denial . I was just saying out loud what I believed to be the obvious . " We do n't know , Jack , " St. Louis said . " Let 's leave it at that for now . " * * * The death of Theresa Lofton was the kind of murder that gave people pause . Not just in Denver , but everywhere . It made anybody who heard or read about it stop for at least a moment to consider the violent images it conjured in the mind , the twist it caused in the gut . Most homicides are little murders . That 's what we call them in the newspaper business . Their effect on others is limited , their grasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraphs on the inside pages . Buried in the paper the way the victims are buried in the ground . But when an attractive college student is found in two pieces in a theretofore peaceful place like Washington Park , there usually is n't enough space in the paper for all the inches of copy it will generate . Theresa Lofton 's was no little murder . It was a magnet that pulled at reporters from across the country . Theresa Lofton was the girl in two pieces . That was the catchy thing about this one . And so they descended on Denver from places like New York and Chicago and Los Angeles , television , tabloid and newspaper reporters alike . For a week , they stayed at hotels with good room service , roamed the city and the University of Denver campus , asked meaningless questions and got meaningless answers . Some staked out the day care center where Lofton had worked part-time or went up to Butte , where she had come from . Wherever they went they learned the same thing , that Theresa Lofton fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girl . The Theresa Lofton murder was inevitably compared to the Black Dahlia case of fifty years ago in Los Angeles . In that case , a not so All-American Girl was found severed at the midriff in an empty lot . A tabloid television show dubbed Theresa Lofton the White Dahlia , playing on the fact that she had been found on a snow-covered field near Denver 's Lake Grassmere . And so the story fed on itself . It burned as hot as a trashcan fire for almost two weeks . But nobody was arrested and there were other crimes , other fires for the national media to warm itself by . Updates on the Lofton case dropped back into the inside pages of the Colorado papers . They became briefs for the digest pages . And Theresa Lofton finally took her spot among the little murders . She was buried . All the while , the police in general , and my brother in particular , remained virtually mute , refusing even to confirm the detail that the victim had been found in two parts . That report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rocky named Iggy Gomez . He had been in the park looking for wild art-the feature photos that fill the pages on a slow news day-when he happened upon the crime scene ahead of any other reporters or photographers . The cops had made the callouts to the coroner 's and crime scene offices by landline since they knew the Rocky and the Post monitored their radio frequencies . Gomez took shots of two stretchers being used to remove two body bags . He called the city desk and said the cops were working a two-bagger and from the looks of the size of the bags the victims were probably children . Later , a cop shop reporter for the Rocky named Van Jackson got a source in the coroner 's office to confirm the grim fact that a victim had come into the morgue in two parts . The next morning 's story in the Rocky served as the siren call to the media across the country . My brother and his CAPs team worked as if they felt no obligation to talk to the public at all . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scant few lines in a press release , announcing that the investigation was continuing and that there had been no arrests . Continues ...
