<p> ARTS , ENTERTAINMENT , AND CULTURE <p> Deregulation Prompts Merger Mania in Media <p> AS merger mania swept through the entertainment industry this year , Mickey Mouse became a corporate fat cat , Ted Turner traded in his much-vaunted independence , and CBS suddenly found itself the golden hope of a limping industrial giant . <p> Technological advancements and talk of deregulation spurred the realignments . <p> Disney started off the frenzy in August by announcing its intention to buy CapCities/ABC . Several days later , Westinghouse confirmed Wall Street reports and announced it planned to buy CBS . <p> That prompted speculation that CNN 's Ted Turner was bent on spoiling the Westinghouse deal with a higher bid for CBS . But Turner announced he was selling out to Time Warner . <p> Consumer advocates worry that centralization of control could lead to a loss of diversity , choice , and high-quality news programming . <p> The regulations that forbade networks from owning much of the material they broadcast were lifted , and Congress once again began revamping the nation 's 60-year-old telecommunications law . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Hitting Hollywood <p> CONGRESS focused once again on the violent images Hollywood 's dream machine routinely produces . Outraged lawmakers attacked everything from " trash talk " television to violent kids ' programming to misogynistic " gangsta rap . " <p> Talk TV took center stage after a guest on the " Jenny Jones " talk show shot and killed a homosexual acquaintance after he revealed a " secret crush " on him . <p> Congress voted to require television manufacturers to install a computer v-chip for parents to screen out violent programs from their children . Broadcasters worry it will lead to censorship . <p> Supporters contend " gangsta rap , " with its angry , drug-riddled lyrics , is art , a warning cry from the ghetto that is ignored at society 's peril . Critics call it trash that tells kids that killing , rape , and drugs are okay . <p> C. Delores Tucker , stalwart of the civil rights movement , and former US Department of Education Secretary William Bennett helped force Time Warner to divest its interest in one of the country 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandra Marks <p> SOCIAL AND CULTURAL CHANGES <p> Taking ' Family Responsibility ' <p> Instead of abstract talk about " family values , " the new political theme song for 1995 was " family responsibility . " <p> Requiring families to take care of their own , rather than relying on the government , is the underpinning of welfare reform . <p> In 1995 , domestic violence received heightened attention during and after the O.J. Simpson murder trial . Merely deploring spouse battering and child abuse graduated from rhetoric to activism in the form of tough new legislation in states like Minnesota . <p> New laws also crack down on so-called " deadbeat dads " ( and moms ) , with states such as Maine taking away the driver 's licenses and professional licenses of those who refuse to pay child support . <p> - Marilyn Gardner <p> A mixed report on crime <p> ANYONE who thinks the stock market provided the year 's most astounding statistics has n't looked at crime and punishment . <p> Murders ? Down 12 percent in the first half of 1995 for the largest drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any year since 1976 . And the pace is accelerating . It took 12 years after the death penalty was legalized again to reach the first 100 executions , but just 2.5 years to reach the latest 100 . <p> Incarceration ? The 12 months through last June saw the biggest increase in state and federal inmates in United States history . The US incarceration rate leads the world . <p> Tough-on-crime politicians might feel good about 1995 . Others are troubled . The application of capital punishment continues to be shockingly imprecise . Three death-row inmates were acquitted this year when evidence of their innocence was heard at retrial . That boosts to 57 the number of men since 1973 who wrongly faced the death penalty but were proved innocent in time . <p> Nonetheless , legislation is pending in Congress to curb appeals by death row inmates . Another inmate , whom a judge this year concluded is probably innocent based on compelling new evidence , would not have been granted a hearing under the proposed law . <p> Then there 's the rising number of black males in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are either incarcerated , on probation , or on parole . The figure soared from 23 percent just six years earlier . Unlike the stock market , these statistics provide nothing to cheer about . <p> - Scott Pendleton <p> Religion on the rise <p> The ongoing return of the baby boomer population to church is a significant trend in American religion . " Mega-churches " - suburban congregations with as many as 10,000 members - are increasing as well as churches of " small groups " offering spiritual fellowship and support . <p> This " respiritualization of the suburbs " is also seen in the " Promise Keepers " phenomenon - huge rallies of Christian-oriented men pledging devotion to the idea of marriage and family . In addition , the conservative Christian Coalition has organized strongly inside the Republican Party in 31 states . <p> The profile of Muslims in America reached a new level with Louis Farrakhan 's " Million Man March . " Hate crimes against Muslims increased , and several mosques were firebombed . At 4 million to 6 million in number , there are more Muslims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marquand <p> Debate continues on education reform <p> Education issues at the national level were a virtual no-show in the political battles between Congress and the White House . The long-standing education-reform debate centers on school choice , giving parents a greater say in where and how their children are educated . <p> Expectedly , the new Congress wants to leave school choice issues to the states . At the state and local level , 19 states had or passed charter-school laws , while in more than a dozen others , charter-school legislation was pending . Proponents of charter schools see them as a way to improve all public schools by providing a competitive choice . Opponents see charter schools as a thinly disguised voucher plan . <p> The much heralded development of private companies running troubled inner-city public schools for profit ( privatization ) got a sharp setback when both the Hartford and Baltimore public school systems canceled their private contracts . <p> - Jim Bencivenga <p> SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY <p> 1995 : the Year of the Internet <p> In 1995 , Americans went on-line in droves to connect with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " allowed users to easily navigate the World Wide Web , the graphic part of the Internet <p> It was especially hip for anyone in search of an audience . Artists , writers , publishers , politicians , and even teenagers put material on-line . At year end , 169 of the Fortune 500 companies had a Web " home page . " A year earlier almost none did . <p> No one knows exactly the size of the Web audience . Estimates range from under 10 million to more than 30 million people , most in the US . Businesses wondered how money could be made on-line . In 1995 , hardly anyone made money on the Web . <p> The Web also sent shock waves through the computer industry . Analysts suddenly perceived that Web browser software might compete with dominant Microsoft . IBM and other companies saw the possibility of marketing stripped-down computers aimed at browsing the Web . <p> While most analysts were bullish on the Web , Frank Gens , a vice president at IDC predicted that 20 percent of Fortune 500 companies would abandon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointing financial results . <p> - Laurent Belsie <p> Planet ho ! <p> In October , researchers from the University of Geneva announced striking evidence of a planet orbiting a star in the constellation Pegasus , 57 light years from Earth . A pair of astronomers in California confirmed the finding . <p> After analyzing changes in the star 's spectrum caused by the planet , the astronomers concluded the planet has a mass of between half and twice that of Jupiter . Its orbit 's radius is about one-sixth that of Mercury 's , and it speeds around its star in 4.2 days . <p> If the discovery survives other explanations , it not only would represent the first evidence for planets around sun-like stars , it also would raise doubts about how well astronomers understand planet formation . In light of our solar system 's experience , such huge planets should form much farther away from their suns . <p> New state of matter <p> In June , researchers from the University of Colorado and the National Institute of Standards and Technology confirmed a prediction of Albert Einstein and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billionths of a degree above absolute zero and created the Bose-Einstein Condensate , a new form of matter . <p> In the world of quantum physics , you can measure an atom 's velocity and its location , but not both with the same precision . Pin one down and the other can only be described in terms of probabilities . At a temperature close to absolute zero , when atoms ' movement has come to a near standstill , their velocity is known with a high degree of certainty . So their locations become indistinct , Einstein theorized , and the atoms could overlap and act as one superatom . <p> - Peter N. Spotts <p> SPORTS <p> Baseball Finishes Season on a High Note <p> Baseball came close to alienating its fans because of a strike , but finished on a high note provided by Oriole shortstop Cal Ripken 's new record and a postseason marked by new teams and good games . <p> Public disillusionment was high when Major Leaguers finally returned to work in late April . Hundreds of replacement players were let go and a labor-management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' 95 season , but the issues are still unresolved . <p> Disgusted by baseball 's disregard for its paying customers , fans stayed away in droves .

His actions threaten the basic " one for all , and all for one " principle of the league . <p> The college football year began with Nebraska winning its first national championship under coach Tom Osborne , and will end with the Cornhuskers playing for the title again - this time at a Jan. 2 Fiesta Bowl date with Florida . <p> - Ross Atkin <p> ETCETERAS <p> New management at the Times Mirror Company , closed the doors on New York Newsday in July and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to the Unabomber 's threat to continue a mail-bombing campaign that has killed three and maimed 27 since 1978 , The Washington Post , with the help of The New York Times , printed the terrorist 's manifesto on Sept. 19 .
