Jamil Roubayee , a 32-year-old doctor , glances around the emergency room and tugs nervously at the stethoscope in the pocket of his white coat . On one side of the ward lie four elderly men who were rushed to Baghdad 's biggest hospital , the 12-story , powder blue Saddam Hussein Medical Center , after suffering heart attacks . On the other side are two ailing women as well as a little boy afflicted with sickle-cell anemia . Because of the international blockade against Iraq , Roubayee says , the hospital lacks antibiotics and other medicines necessary to treat the patients . At least one of the men will soon die , he predicts , and the boy may lapse into a coma . <P> As conditions deteriorate by the day , Roubayee , the hospital 's chief resident , can hardly bear to contemplate what will happen next . Once the U.N . deadline for Iraq 's withdrawal from Kuwait expires this week , he fears that American and allied planes will bomb Baghdad and that his hospital will be overwhelmed with the wounded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who once served as a medic in an Iraqi army tank unit . " Doctors are very anxious . You have patients dying in front of you , and there is nothing you can do about it . We hope there will be no war . " <P> Yet the mood in this city of nearly 4 million is that there will be war , and as each day passes , the gloom deepens . As foreign diplomats evacuate their embassies and prepare to fly out of the country , Iraqis wait at service stations in lines 30 , 40 , 50 cars long to buy enough gas to make sure they can drive out of the city in case of attack . The government closed the museums and moved its Babylonian and Abbasid treasures to bomb shelters . Many Iraqis were putting tape over their windows to prevent shattering in case of bombing . Others are laying in a month 's supply of food , getting ready to sit out what their leader has promised will be the " mother of all battles . " <P> Spirits grow darker with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn safety precautions at 342 hastily organized civil-defense training centers . Some 10,000 doctors , nurses and other medical personnel began undergoing mandatory civil-defense instruction . Officials told the owners of buildings in Baghdad to convert their basements into well-equipped bomb shelters . Iraqi TV showed lengthy footage of soldiers at the front chanting patriotic slogans and saying how ready they were to defend Iraq if attacked by the U.S. The Baghdad newspaper al-Jumhuriyah published advice on how to identify a chemical-bomb attack : there will be a muffled explosion with a lot of smoke , leaves will fall from trees , and the ground will quickly become littered with dead insects .
