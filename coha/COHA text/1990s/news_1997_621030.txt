<p> Five years after pledging to save the planet from ecological ruin at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro , world leaders are about to try again . <p> As many as 70 presidents and prime ministers are expected in New York next week for Earth Summit+5 , a special session of the U.N . General Assembly called to assess progress since the Rio summit and nudge nations along the elusive path to " sustainable development . " <p> The impressive flock of dignitaries , President Clinton among them , may have a tough time convincing anyone that they or their nations have come very far . <p> With some pivotal promises made at Rio unfulfilled and key indicators of global environmental health worsening , diplomats and environmentalists say the challenges are now greater , yet expectations are , if anything , lower . <p> " We 've come some distance , but not as far as we should have . In some areas we 've come only a very short distance , if at all , " conceded Eileen Claussen , assistant secretary of state for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't slipped off the ( international ) agenda , " said Claussen , part of the U.S. team negotiating Earth Summit+5 agreements . " But Rio was very ambitious . I honestly think it 's a whole lot harder than people thought even then . " <p> In broad terms , the goals remain the same : weaning wealthy nations from habits of production and consumption that are straining the Earth 's ecological capacities , while encouraging poorer nations to pursue a gentler environmental course as they strive to catch up . <p> FAMILIAR AGENDA <p> Although there are a few new issues since Rio , like preserving scarce supplies of fresh water , it is for the most part a familiar agenda  --  heading off global warming , curbing deforestation , easing the deep poverty that drives environmental destruction in many regions . <p> And through it all , once again , runs an issue that has grown only more rancorous  --  what kind of help the developing countries of the Southern Hemisphere , in global terms , can expect from the industrialized countries of the Northern Hemisphere . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of aid flowing to the South has declined . Developing countries are demanding renewed commitments , for both money and technology , and they hint broadly that without such commitments their environmental resolve will be sorely tested . <p> " We 're going backwards from Rio , " said General Assembly President Razali Ismail of Malaysia . " The diplomats are getting back to the old trench politics of North and South . I 'm hoping the political leaders who come can elevate the process to a higher plane . " <p> Whether they do may well hinge on another summit 2,000 miles away . Clinton and the other leaders of the Group of 8 industrial powers , convening this weekend in Denver , may try to narrow their differences over forests and climate change before heading to New York . <p> There have been successes since Rio . Treaties have been negotiated to slow desertification of arid areas and overfishing of the oceans . Even the stubborn issue of overpopulation appears to have turned a corner  --  the rate of growth is slowing . <p> EMISSIONS ARE RISING <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the loss of species is accelerating and the portion of the globe covered by forest continues to shrink . <p> Even more than at Rio , the outcome of Earth Summit+5 will be largely a matter of words . At Rio , leaders signed binding treaties on global warming and biodiversity . Here , the only products will be a short but sweeping political declaration and a lengthier agreement full of prescriptions that , it is hoped , will lead to concrete actions later on . <p> Since Rio , there have been important changes in the global arena . Trade liberalization was well under way at the time of Rio but now has come to dominate the international agenda even more . Globalization is the new mantra , and that does not necessarily bode well for environmental protection . <p> PROBLEMS ESCALATING <p> " You do n't have to be a Nobel laureate to see that if the global economy continues to grow the way it is , there 's no way we can avoid problems in terms of climate change , acidification , polluted rivers , deforestation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , director of policy at the United Nations Development Program . <p> The freer movement of goods and capital is also recasting the North-South debate . <p> Although direct aid is down , private investment in developing economies has soared since Rio , and Northern countries are suggesting that it be viewed as a substitute for public aid . <p> The target set at Rio was for industrialized countries to raise the level of giving to 0.7 percent of their gross national products . Since then , the average has dropped from 0.33 to 0.27 percent . The United States , which has always disavowed the 0.7 target , now ranks fourth in total development aid and last in percentage of GNP . <p> Developing countries , Claussen said , " have to be more practical . There 's never going to be the 0.7 . It 's not only us . The other countries are n't going to do it , either . " <p> To the South , such talk is a betrayal of the political bargain struck at Rio . Although developing countries clearly welcome the private investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few nations , and there is no guarantee that the development it supports is " sustainable . " <p> THE GLOBAL VILLAGE <p> " The benefits have not been even . Those countries without the technology and infrastructure have been marginalized even more , " said Ambassador Daudi Mwakawago of Tanzania , which chairs the Group of 77 , representing 128 developing countries . <p> " There is talk about the global village . Then we need to be each other 's keeper . Those who have resources have to take care of those who are less endowed , " Mwakawago said . " These were firm commitments made at Rio . If they 're saying it 's not realistic , what are they offering ? " <p> Back at Rio , many environmentalists took heart that world leaders seemed to be paying attention , if only long enough to pay lip service to their concerns . <p> Disenchanted five years later by the pace of international policymaking , some now take solace instead in smaller steps at the grassroots level , where they see stronger signs that the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't need any more agendas . What we need are very short to-do lists , where we get countries to make specific commitments and to deliver on them , " said Jacob Scherr of the Natural Resources Defense Council . <p> " Otherwise , " Scherr said , " we 're just going to continue the implementation gap  --  the chasm between promises made and what 's being delivered . " <p> EARTH SUMMIT+5 ISSUES <p> . <p> Key issues before the U.N . General Assembly when it meets next week to assess progress five years after the Earth Summit in Rio : <p> . <p> * Global Warming  --  Most industrialized countries will not meet emissions reductions pledged at Rio . A new treaty to be negotiated by December will set targets for years beyond 2000 . Environmentalists and Western European countries are pressing the United States for specific commitments now . <p> . <p> * Forests  --  Several countries , including major timber exporters , want to begin negotiating a forest treaty . Environmentalists and the United States are opposed , saying that a treaty would be weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> . <p> * Finance  --  Aid from the industrialized North to the developing South is declining , despite increases pledged at Rio . Developing countries say they need strong financial commitments if they are to achieve sustainable development . <p> . <p> * Freshwater  --  There is agreement on the need for an international strategy to protect and ease conflicts over scarce freshwater supplies . <p> TRENDS SINCE RIO <p> . <p> Despite some areas of progress , key indicators of global environmental health have worsened since the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro . <p> . <p> * Population  --  The number of new people added to the planet each year is thought to have peaked in 1995 at 81 million . World population is projected to stabilize in 2050 at about 10 billion . <p> * Climate  --  Emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases continue to rise , threatening to raise global temperatures 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100 . <p> * Forests  --  Despite some reduction in overall logging , 33.8 million acres of forest , roughly the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> * Species  --  Loss of species and habitat continues at an unprecedented rate , with an estimated 50,000 plant and animal species disappearing each year . <p> * Oceans  --  About 60 percent of the world 's fish stocks are depleted or overfished . A new treaty negotiated but not yet ratified would set quotas on international fish stocks . <p> * Fresh water  --  A fifth of the world 's population lacks access to safe water . The number of countries facing " moderate " to " severe " water stress is likely to double by 2025 . <p> * Consumption  --  Twenty percent of the world 's population consumes 80 percent of the resources . While fossil fuel use has stabilized in industrialized countries , it is rising in developing countries . <p> * Poverty  --  Gaps between rich and poor continue to grow , both within and between countries . Over 1.1 billion people  --  1 in 5  --  live on less than a dollar a day . <p> . <p> Source : United Nations
