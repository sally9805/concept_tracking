The post train races full speed from the HappyTrach-Tararach station to the Run-for-YourLife station . The locomotive whistles , hisses , puffs , snorts ; the cars shake , and their unoiled wheels howl like wolves and screech like owls ! Darkness is over the skies , over the earth , and in the cars . " Something-will-happen , something-will-happen , " the wagons hammer , rattling with age . " Ohohohoho ! " the locomotive joins in . Pickpockets and cold drafts sweep through the wagons . Terrible ! I stick my head out the window and look aimlessly into the endless expanse . All the lights are green , but somewhere down the line I 'm sure all hell will break loose . The signal disk and the station lights are not yet visible . Darkness , anguish , thoughts of death , memories of childhood , oh God ! <p> " I have sinned ! " I whisper , " I have sinned ! " I feel a hand slip into my back pocket . The pocket is empty , but still it 's horrifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . He is wearing a straw hat and a dark gray shirt . <p> " Can I help you ? " I ask him , patting my hands over my pockets . <p> " No , I 'm just looking out the window ! " he answers , pulling back his hand and leaning against my back . <p> There is a powerful , earsplitting whistle . The train slows and slows , and finally it stops . I get out of the car and walk over to the station buffet for a drink to bolster my courage . The buffet is bustling with passengers and train workers . <p> " A vodka , sweet and easy ! " the thickset chief conductor says , turning to a fat gentleman . The fat gentleman wants to say something but ca n't : his year-old sandwich is stuck in his throat . <p> " Poli-i-i-ce ! Poli-i-i-ce ! " someone outside on the platform is shouting , as in primordial times , before the Deluge , hungry mastodons , ichthyosaurs , and plesiosaurs would have bellowed . I go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his hat is standing outside one of the first-class cars pointing to his feet . Someone swiped the poor man 's shoes and socks while he was sleeping . <p> " What am I going to do ? " he shouts . " I have to go all the way to Revel ! Can you believe this ? " A policeman , standing in front of him , informs him , " It 's against the rules to shout here . " I climb back into my car , No. 224 . It 's exactly as it was : dark , the sound of snoring , tobacco and soot in the air-the smell of Mother Russia . A red-haired inspector traveling to Kiev from Ryazan is snoring next to me . . . a few feet away from him a pretty girl is dozing . . . a peasant in a straw hat snorts , puffs , changes position , and does n't know where to put his long legs . . . in the corner someone is munching , and loudly smacking his lips . Under the benches people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrinkly little old women come hobbling in with bundles on their backs . . . <p> " Here ! Let 's sit here ! " one of them says . " Ooh , it 's dark ! Temptations from Below ! Oops , I stepped on someone ! . . . but where is Pakhom ? " <p> " Pakhom ? Oh , good gracious ! Where has he got to now ! Oh , good gracious ! " <p> The little old woman bustles about , opens the window , and looks up and down the platform . <p> " Pa-a-a-khom ! " she brays . " Where are you ? Pakhom ! We 're over here ! " <p> " I have a pro-o-o-blem ! " a voice calls from outside . " They wo n't let me on ! " <p> " They wo n't let you on ? Cowshit ! No one can stop you , you have a real ticket ! " " They 've stopped selling tickets ! The ticket office is closed ! " <p> Someone leads a horse up the platform . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " the policeman shouts . " Get off immediately ! Nothing but trouble ! " <p> " Petrovna ! " Pakhom moans . <p> Petrovna drops her bundle , takes hold of a large tin teapot and quickly runs out of the car . The second bell rings . A little conductor with a black mustache comes in . <p> " You 're going to have to get a ticket , " he whispers to the old man sitting opposite me . " The controller just got on ! " <p> " Really ! Oh . . . That 's bad ! . . . What , the Prince himself ? " <p> " The Prince ? Ha , you could beat him with a stick , he 'd never come to do an inspection himself . " <p> " So , who is it ? The one with the beard ? " " Yes , him . " <p> " Well , if it 's him , that 's fine . He 's a good man ! " " It 's up to you . " " Are there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I say , good for them ! Fast workers ! " <p> My heart constricts . I 'm a ride-hopper , too . I always hop rides . On the railroads the ridehoppers are those passengers who prefer to " inconvenience " conductors with money rather than pay the cashier at the station . Being a ride-hopper is great , dear reader . The unwritten rule is that ride-hoppers get a 75 percent discount . Furthermore , they do n't have to line up at ticket windows or take their ticket out of their pocket every few minutes , and the conductor is much more courteous to them . . . in a nutshell , it 's the best way to travel ! <p> " What 's the point of paying whatever , whenever ? " the old man mumbles . " Never ! I always pay the conductor directly ! The conductor needs money more than the railroad does ! " The third bell rings . <p> " Oh dear , oh dear ! " the little old woman whines . " Where on earth is Petrovna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! We 've lost her ! We 've lost her , poor dear ! And her things are still here . . . what am I going to do with her things , with her bag ! Heavens above , we 've lost her . " ' <p> The little old woman thinks for a moment . " If she ca n't get on , she 'll need it ! " she says and throws Petrovna 's bag out the window . <p> The train sets off for Khaldeyevo , which according to my Frum tourist guide is no more than a common grave . The controller and the chief conductor enter , carrying candles . " Ti-i-i-ckets , " the chief conductor shouts . The controller turns to me and the old man : " Your tickets ! " <p> We shrink back , stoop over , rummage through our pockets , and then stare at the chief conductor , who winks at us . <p> " Get their tickets ! " the controller says to the conductor and marches on . We are saved . " Tickets ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nudges a sleeping young man . The young man wakes up and pulls the yellow ticket out of his hat . <p> " Where 're you going ? " the controller asks , twirling the ticket in his fingers . " This is n't where we 're going ! " <p> " You blockhead , this is n't where we 're going ! " the chief conductor chimes in . " You got on the wrong train , you idiot ! You 're supposed to be heading for Zhivoderevo , and we 're heading for Khaldeyevo ! Here 's your ticket back ! You should keep your eyes open ! " <p> The young man blinks , looks dully at the smiling crowd , and starts rubbing his eyes . " Do n't cry ! " people tell him . " You 'd better ask them to help you ! A big lout like you , probably even married with children , howling like that ! " <p> " Ti-i-i-ckets ! " the chief conductor shouts at a farmer with a top hat . " What ? " <p> " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket ? You need it ? " " Your ticket ! " <p> " I see . . . No , definitely , why not if you need it ! " The farmer with the top hat reaches into his vest , quickly pulls out a greasy piece of paper , and hands it over to the controller . <p> " What are you giving me here ? This is your passport ! I want to see your ticket ! " " This is all I have ! " the farmer answers , visibly shaken . <p> " How can you travel when you do n't have a ticket ? " <p> " But I 've paid . " <p> " What do you mean you paid ? Whom did you pay ? " <p> " The c-con-condunctor . " " Which conductor ? " <p> " How the devil am I supposed to know which c-con-condunctor ? Some condunctor , it 's as simple as that . . . You do n't need a ticket , he said , you can travel without one . . . so I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll discuss this further at the station . Madam , your ticket ! " The door creaks , opens , and to everyone 's surprise Petrovna enters . <p> " Oh Lord , what a hard time I had finding my compartment . . how 's one supposed to tell them apart , they all look the same . . . And they did n't let Pakhom get on , the snakes . . . Where 's my bag ? " <p> " Oh ! . . . Temptations from Below ! . . . I threw it out the window for you . I thought we 'd left you behind ! " <p> " You threw it where ? " <p> " Out the window . How was I to know ? " " Oh , thank you very much ! Who told you to do that , you old hag ! May the Lord forgive me ! What am I going to do ? Why did n't you throw your own bag out , you bitch ! It 's your ugly mug you should have thrown out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " <p> " You 'll have to send a telegram from the next station ! " the laughing crowd suggests . Petrovna starts wailing loudly and spouting profanities . Her friend , also crying , is clutching her bag . The conductor comes in . <p> " Whose things are these ? " he shouts , holding up Petrovna 's bag . <p> " Pret-t-t-y ! " the old man sitting opposite whispers to me , nodding his head at the pretty girl . " Mmm . . . pret-t-y . . . pity I do n't have any chloroform on me ! One whiff and she 'd be out ! Then I could kiss her for all I 'm worth ! " <p> The man in the straw hat stirs uncomfortably and in a loud voice curses his long legs . " Scientists , " he mumbles . " Scientists . . . you ca n't fight the nature of things . . . scientists ! Ha ! How come they have n't come up with something so we can screw our legs on and off at will ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . . . Speak to the public prosecutor ! " the inspector sitting next to me shouts . <p> In the far corner two high-school boys , a noncommissioned officer , and a blue-eyed young man are huddled together playing a game of cards by the light of their cigarettes . <p> A tall lady is sitting haughtily to my right . She reeks of powder and patchouli . " Oh , how absolutely divine it is to be en route , " some goose is whispering into her ear , her voice sugary. . . nauseatingly sugary . . Frenchifying her g 's , n 's , and r 's . " One 's rapprochement is never as quick and as charming as it is when one is en route . Oh , how I do love being en route ! " A kiss . . . another . . . what the hell is going on ? The pretty girl wakes up , looks around , and unconsciously rests her head against the man sitting next to her , the devotee of Justice . . . but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halt . " The train will be stopping for two minutes ! " a hoarse bass voice mutters outside the railroad car . Two minutes pass , two more . . . Five minutes pass , ten , twenty , and the train is still standing . What the hell 's going on ! I get off the train and make my way to the locomotive . <p> " Ivan Matevitch ! Get a move on ! Damn ! " the chief conductor shouts from the locomotive . <p> The engine driver crawls out from under the locomotive , red , wet , a piece of soot sticking to his nose . . . <p> " Damn you ! Damn you ! " he shouts up at the chief conductor . " Get off my back ! Are you blind ? Ca n't you see what 's going on ? God ! Ahh . . . I wish you 'd all go to hell ! This is supposed to be a locomotive ? This is no locomotive , it 's a pile of junk ! I 'm not traveling any further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " <p> " You can do whatever you like ! How about getting another locomotive-I refuse to travel on this one ! Do n't you understand ? " <p> The driver 's helpers run around the brokendown engine , banging , shouting . . . the station chief in a red cap tells Jewish jokes to his assistant . . . it starts to rain . . . I head back to my railroad car . . . the stranger in the straw hat and the dark gray shirt rushes by . . . he 's carrying a suitcase . God . . . it 's my suitcase ! <p>
