More than anything else , skiing is balancing . To acquire optimal balance , it is essential to eliminate excessive or unnecessary movements . Some experts call this " economy of motion . " The skiers who demonstrate true economy of motion are the world 's top racers . On icy race courses , at high speeds , they keep the upper body relatively still ( but not rigid ) , while the lower body moves dynamically . Keeping the upper body still has a stabilizing effect that aids balance ; maintaining a dynamic lower body controls the skis for optimum edge hold and turning power and allows the skier to absorb terrain irregularities . A person walking a tightrope holding a long pole gains stability from the pole 's length and weight . The skier 's " pole " is his arms . That 's why maintaining good arm position  --  arms forward and out to the side  --  is so important , as the accompanying photos demonstrate . The arms also function as the skier 's first balance-recovery mechanism . How can you distinguish a racer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ? For one thing , the most efficient racer is likely to be the fastest through the course . But curiously enough , as Ingemar Stenmark once noted , such a skier may look quite slow  --  because he or she is so smooth , with no wild gestures . Fluid rhythm is the mark of the fast racer . To the observer , the racer makes it look easy . If you were to block out the view of the lower body and just look at the upper body , you might wonder if the skier is doing anything at all , so little activity is apparent . Meanwhile , the lower body is moving from side to side like a pendulum , and the skis are carving the ice with precision . At a men 's World Cup slalom race at Breckenridge , Colorado , last December , Alberto Tomba collided with a slalom pole and had his goggles knocked askew , blocking his vision . This happened about halfway down the course , on a very steep and icy pitch . Rather than give up and ski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same speed , negotiating two gates while he reached up with both hands and repositioned his goggles . Astonishingly , he came within a few hundredths of winning the race . Tomba skis with the most stable upper body of any competitor in the world today . Because of this , his balance is so good that having his goggles knocked down over his eyes was a problem that he could handle with no loss of momentum . At the other extreme is the skier who has little economy of motion . This skier has a dynamic upper body and a static lower body , characterized by waving arms , a torso that rotates in the direction that the skis are turning , and stiff , unbending legs . This is a skier that spends most of his ski time out of control and fighting for balance . Every inappropriate and exaggerated arm movement creates an imbalance , which has to be corrected with an opposite and equally inappropriate arm movement . Rotating the upper body in the direction that the skis are turning often results in too much weight on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Skiers who do n't use economy of motion may also bend forward at the waist with every turn . Because 50 percent of a person 's mass is above the navel , the act of bending forward will change the pressure on the skis enough to affect their ability to carve . The result ? More balance problems . Whether a racer or a casual recreational skier , your goal should be to ski with as much economy of motion as possible . Not only will this improve your overall balance , it will reduce muscular fatigue , enhance rhythm and grace in your skiing , and improve your confidence . Ski technicians describe economy of motion as having the fewest muscular contractions possible . The more muscles contract , the more tension there is in the body  --  and the quicker the skier will tire . The more relaxed the skier , the easier it will be to ski rhythmically . Rhythmical skiing gives you more muscular power . In fact , skiing with good economy of motion is easier today  --  and available to more skiers  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sport . That 's because the equipment is so much better . Today 's skis are softer in flex and lighter in weight ; that makes them easier to turn and control . Fifteen years ago skis were much stiffer , and exaggerated movements were sometimes required to get them to turn . Piero Gros , who won the slalom at the 1976 Olympics , used to unweight his skis with such an exaggerated extension of his body  --  and raising of his arms  --  that it looked as if he might take flight . That 's not needed with today 's skis . Skiers like Tomba and Marc Girardelli use minimal extension in short turns and much less extension than in Gros 's day in long turns  --  and they hardly lift their arms at all to start a turn . Today , racers and recreational skiers alike have the benefit of the improved equipment , and true economy of motion is within the reach of everyone .
