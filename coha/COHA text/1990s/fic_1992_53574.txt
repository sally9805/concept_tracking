Poa compressa , Canadian bluegrass , grows well in both damp and dry climates , blooms the entire season , wo n't brown even with a late frost , and is a real royal blue ; in the right sunlight it looks painted . The first crop on my brother Nelson 's grave has come in thickly , almost plush , and kneeling on it , sliding the outside edge of the grass shears ' blade flush with the polished granite headstone , I hear the swift double knock of a woodpecker in a tree and remember Nelson in his youth as sharply as if he stood before me now : a tank top , shorts , dusty shoes . His skin is tanned and cut from falls , from fights , from accidents . His shoulders are muscular , his slicked hair glistens in the sun . Mother stands above him , shaking a lemon over his bent brown head as if to baptize him , scolding him for his latest mischief , and when she drops the lemon , Nelson picks it up , runs his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face to smell . Then he hands the lemon back . Mother straightens , tums away , smiling , rubbing the lemon as she walks . The incident has already vanished from her mind . Nelson pulls a book from under his shirt and sits against a tree to read , the book 's red leather binding propped on his knees . The book is a tale of pirates and their deaths , which he has stolen from the library . Hours later , near dusk , the mosquitoes swarming , swallows rising through the heavy blue air , Father finds Nelson still sitting against the tree with the book . He takes the book from Nelson 's hands , marks the page , lays it aside on the grass , and slaps Nelson across the face , twice . The slaps echo off the garage , like twinned distant shots . Nelson has been dismissed from yet another school , gambling again , on golf . He is twelve years old . <p> I sit back on my heels and take a small leather notebook from my pocket to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things I hope to tell Sandra , my great niece . The brown notebook is old but unused , and I hear its spine crack as I smooth open its pages . A few days ago , Sandra called and asked how I was feeling , if I were still following baseball , how my garden was coming . I 'd taken her to a few games as a child , collected autographs for her , but that was years ago , and I knew that the real subject of her call was yet to surface . I believe she is interested in asking some questions about her relatives , especially my brother , her grandfather , and his wife . At least , this is what I am hoping . <p> Nelson is not buried next to my parents . He has a plot he paid for years ago , between his wife 's and a tilting box elder . The neat green rectangle their graves make leaves no room for other graves , not even for those of their daughters . For years , I thought I would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withstood those slaps , his imperious refusal to acknowledge them even when the red print of my father 's hand lingered on his face for hours because of his fair skin . After Father hit him that time , Nelson picked up the book and began reading again , or pretended to . The light was fading so fast I doubted he could see the page . The swallows , still tumbling and turning like a school of fish , I perceived as a sense of movement in the dark sky , a darting shadow . <p> Father never hit me , or any of the rest of us . Nelson seemed marked off , as if he and Father had agreed early on that the hitting was in some secret way necessary , though the hitting never seemed to change anything : Nelson was suspended or dismissed from four other schools before finally graduating from St. Martin 's in the Field and going on to Yale . Father died years before I thought of asking him why he had hit Nelson , and Nelson , even at twelve , seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us all , himself included , from some private remove . Had I asked him , I believe he would have ignored me . That aloofness first attracted and then repelled me ; I wanted to be like Nelson , I wanted nothing to do with him . Now , passing my hand over the thick blue grass above his grave , letting the blades tickle my palm , feeling them bend beneath the weight of my slight touch , I am simply happy he was my brother . <p> Finished with Nelson 's grave , I move on to his wife 's . The grass is thicker here , powdery soft . Its roots grow many feet in a season , binding the soil , keeping wind and rain from blowing everything away . Like most grass it has a peculiar , earthy smell , which to me is the smell of death , I 've encountered it on so many graves . Their stones are the same clay-colored granite , though Delia 's requires more work to keep clean . A few steps closer to the cemetery road it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rubbing dirt from the letters , I see her name written across my reflection on the polished stone . <p> I met Nelson 's wife a year before he did , at the Chatter Box Club 's Christmas ball . Delia is a pretty name , but for some reason Nelson always called her Pete , even putting that name on her stone . I was standing by the punch bowl when she entered , and saw the smooth whiteness of her neck and shoulders when a chaperone took her stole , her soft curving profile as she turned away . Her neck reminded me of a swan 's and I had never seen lips so red . I walked by her seat three times , the second and third times waving to an imaginary friend at the far end of the floor to give myself a reason to pass , but I had n't the nerve to talk to her or even to come close enough to smell her perfume . She sat on the edge of the chair , looking out over that sea of dancers expectantly , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found her beauty unapproachable . She and Nelson were a good match . The notebook I am using was hers , her initials stamped in gold leaf in the upper right-hand corner . I found it in one of Nelson 's drawers . <p> I was an usher at their wedding . For most of it , I stood on the edges of the crowd and stared . They seemed to me like people you might read about , otherworldly . Their guest list numbered close to six hundred , the social editor at the Democrat and Chronicle devoted a full page to their reception . ! think that 's why I asked first Gwen and then Abigail to marry me that next year ; I wanted in some way , in many ways , to be like them . <p> Done for the day , I stand and take a few steps back to inspect my work , the straps of my gardener 's kneepads pinching the skin behind my knees . My back is sore and my fingers ache but Nelson and Delia 's graves look splendid . Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like islands in this sea of ragged stones , as the two did in life . <p> Tomorrow , I will work on Abigail 's grave , and Mother 's and Father 's , and then , if the weather holds , earlier generations later in the week . Abigail , who was once my fiancee , and whose grave is the only one I tend that is not a member of our family . <p> Driving back through the cemetery , slowly , so as not to raise dust from the rutted dirt track , the trees ' shadows moving up over the hood , I remember Nelson and Delia 's first child , stillborn , and never buried . I think that was the only moment of their lives I would n't have lived . <p> Home again , I place the spade , trowel , gardener 's fork , and grass shears on the rubber mat by the door and lean their pitted wooden handles against the wainscoting . Above them I see a framed picture of Nelson and remember the heat of the day when the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not my mind . I feel drained and heavy , submerged in a bath of too-hot water . <p> The yellowed picture , with decorative , scalloped edges , is not a very good one  --  you can just make out Nelson 's face , and mine in profile , looking at him , both of us nearly overwhelmed by the jungle growth surrounding us . But I 've hung the picture by the door on purpose . I see it whenever I leave or enter the house and it reminds me of Nelson 's better qualities . I will have to show it to Sandra . <p> I was a sergeant in the Chemical Warfare Service of the Army in World War II . Nelson joined the Navy and was named skipper of his own ship , a mine sweeper , though before the war he had never served . In fact , his only experience with boats was on transatlantic crossings . He rose to the rank of Lt. Commander . I was stationed in Hollandia , Dutch New Guinea , for ten months , and I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sukarnapura , Indonesia , now . Mostly I dug ditches , which other people later came along and filled . Once , in the middle of a hot day , a day like a blowtorch  --  and it is the sapping weight of this heat I remember  --  I was digging ditches with Fletcher , who was from MIT and weighed 118 pounds , and Stevens , from some California school . He stood six and a half feet tall and his Adam 's apple looked like a partially swallowed brick . Working , we 'd stripped to our shorts and T-shirts , the same color green as the swarming , buzzing flies and the watery mud sucking at our ankles , and I 'd just lowered my head onto my crossed wrists for a rest when I heard someone whistle at us , as if we were pretty women . <p> I looked up and saw Nelson on the berm , all in white , his brass buttons shining in the sun , behind him the razor grass waving like wheat in the hot wind . Stevens and Fletcher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tags tinkling , but I could n't move . " Nelson 's dead , " I thought , and this was his ghost . My body pulsed like a single giant nerve . I felt the hailstone-sized welts the fly bites left on my shoulders and the warm mud eating at my rotten feet and my swollen hands squeezing the wooden pickaxe handle so hard I thought they 'd burst . Somehow he 'd come to tell me and I did n't blink when sweat stung my eyes , afraid he 'd disappear . <p> " Good thing they 've got you three here , " Nelson said , smiling . " If they put you anywhere else you might lose the war all by yourselves . " He returned the salute and told us to knock off work for a while , having arranged it with our CO . <p> He had wangled leave to come and see me . He 'd had a chance to go home and see Delia and his daughters  --  I found this out later , from one of his friends and superiors  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I believe he thought I was in much greater danger than I ever found myself ( though Stevens was killed by a sniper 's bullet as he wandered along a beach ) and wanted to talk with me again in case something happened . <p> I have always relished that memory  --  it overlaid some earlier , painful ones  --  and I take the picture from the wall and study it , searching Nelson 's face for clues to what motivated him , then and always . His inscription  --  To Francis , Nitz ( the name his friends always called him )  --  is faded to a rust color but still legible , and I trace the letters with one dirty fingernail before rehanging the picture and climbing the narrow stairs for a bath . On the upper landing the sun through the window is still hot and I pause in it , warming myself like a cat , one of the true pleasures of age . <p> Before bathing I lay out my clothes , and opening the squeaky sock drawer I smell the faint scent of cedar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he died . On the back , scratched in rickety handwriting seventy-five years ago , is my own name . I doubt Nelson ever saw it . Mother always kept bags of cedar chips in our drawers , lavender in hers , and it was that lavender scent which first attracted me to Gwen . She was a brief interlude in my life , but she marks a change for me , the time when Nelson first began to show an almost casual cruelty towards me . This story may pain Sandra , but I believe she should know it , and so , like my other memories , I record it . <p> I had asked Gwen to marry me . Though far wealthier , she was a pale imitation of Delia , skin neither as smooth nor as soft , her neck a bit too short , retiring where Delia was anything but . We had dated for several months . Dances , picnics in brown October fields , skating on our summer house 's frozen lake , a chaperoned trip to New York . In a horse-drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chaperone , she had given me reason to hope . Outside , I remember , it was bitter cold ; the horses leaned into the drilling wind , mufflers and a turned-up collar hid the cabbie 's face . A string of gaslights circled the park like a necklace and every few seconds gusts of snow blew across them , spreading their light in the air like a stain . Gwen 's fur-framed face shone in the gaslight , lending her small , uneven features a transitory beauty , and the lavender scent of her perfume filled the cab ; when I bent to kiss her I thought I had sealed our future . <p> A month later , standing outside our house on a cold sunny day in early spring , I asked Nelson if he knew why she had turned me down . The lake ice was pewter-colored in the sun , charcoal in the shade . Ribbons of fine snow lay across it , like blown sand . <p> " Do n't you know ? " he said , lighting a cigarette and narrowing his eyes against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head . A blast of wind made us lean closer . I could see that his hair had frozen in tufts . <p> He looked down the long , narrow expanse of the lake toward the tree-covered hills on the far end , the afternoon sky above them a pale watery blue . " It 's because of the way you are . " <p> He glanced at me briefly , as if awaiting my response , but I did n't have one . I did n't know what he meant . He looked away again over the lake and inhaled deeply on the cigarette , the end of it brightening , blew smoke slowly out his nose . <p> " You live your life an inch at a time , " he said , flicking the cigarette away . We both watched the wind pick it up , send its glowing red end skittering over the bumpy pewter-colored ice . When the glow died out , he said , " She 's not like that , and she said it would drive her crazy . " He turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frankly , it would me , too . " <p> Even as a child I had always suspected Nelson disapproved the care I took with things , but he had never been so obvious . Father traveled : Rome , Prague , Paris , Madrid , then later Bangkok and Peking . From every city he brought me coins . Nelson was n't interested . Once , he accompanied me on the downtown trolley to Sibley 's and waited patiently while I chose among several display cases , settling finally on a mahogany frame with etched glass and gold corner seals . When I thanked Nelson he dismissed the notion , saying he 'd done it only because Father had said he would give him an extra two dollars for the trip , and planned to buy cigars and a new shirt with the money , which he did . But he carried the case home for me , and a year later , when he ran into my room to tell me one of the cooks had started a fire in the kitchen that threatened the house , he grabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The fire never spread , but in gratitude I spent the next morning cleaning all the coins with a silver polish that smelled like ink , memorizing their locations and descriptions so I could impress Nelson with my knowledge . He accepted the collection , ran off with it tucked carelessly under his arm , and traded it for two peppermint ice cream sodas , neither of which was for me . Still , these things were hard to read ; for every seemingly cruel or thoughtless act there was another equally generous one . After Gwen , Nelson 's actions became more sharply defined . <p> Less than a year after Gwen , I was engaged . Abigail was a sweet girl . My friends all envied me , though Nelson did n't seem to approve . He told me he and Pete would n't make it back from their Brazilian trip for the wedding , but that both of them knew it would be a fine affair . Two months before the wedding , there was an accident . I was driving . Abigail was only twenty-four when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend her grave . <p> Sitting by my open window and watching the blue sky turn violet , I hear children shouting in the street and the burring sound of mowers as a few late-working fathers cut their lawns . The phone has not rung tonight , as I hoped it would , which has left me feeling the slight , dry scratch of disappointment . Looking at my desk ! see Delia 's open brown notebook , and the disappointment turns into the sudden bum of shame . I often felt that way around Nelson , times he denied me . But then I tell myself to , have faith , to wait , that Sandra will call , that I have not misjudged her . <p> I have taken a hot bath and completed my regimen of stretching and rubbing eucalyptus liniment into my shoulders , arms , and legs . Never especially limber  --  and therefore , never much of an athlete  --  if I fail to do this nights after working on the graves I sleep fitfully and awake the next day stiff and barely able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtains and cools my damp chest , bringing with it the smell of the cut grass , and when the breeze is still , the eucalyptus liniment clears my sinuses . A sort of cosmic breathing in and out , the smells of age and death . <p> At the end of his life , I kept much the same regimen for Nelson . He could not bend enough to reach his feet and care for them . Each night ! rubbed a Dixie cup of ice over his heels to relieve his swelling , and in the mornings , after he bathed , I worked the eucalyptus liniment into his heels and ankles to loosen them . His feet were dry , rough , very light  --  almost as light as the feet of a child  --  but the oranged , horned skin gave them away . In places , it bubbled away from the muscle like the skin of a grilled chicken . I worked fifteen minutes on each foot . I would wake him with a phone call and by the time I arrived he 'd have finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine and find him dressed for bed . We rarely spoke but I believe he appreciated my care . I moved his bed closer to the window , as he said he liked to watch the night sky . <p> It is an unusually warm night , in the seventies though it is now ten o'clock , but you still know it 's spring . Even with the windows open , the night air is quiet . A month from now , it will be filled with the songs of crickets . I remember watching Nelson shimmy down the drainpipe from these same third-floor windows summer nights , on his way to meet girls or friends or just to find adventure . I would hang out the window , the sill cutting into my stomach , and he would call to me standing a white blur in the dark , dusting his hands on his trousers , urging me to come along . The scent of manure from Mother 's garden and the chirping of cicadas filled the night air , and though I wanted to , I could never bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenth , Nelson 's thirteenth  --  I finally joined in on some of Nelson 's mischief . It started as a way to save money : on weekends , we would walk the seven miles from our house to the farm instead of taking the morning trolley , saying we had caught a later one . Soon the walks came to be about more than money , they were about pleasure , a mutual pleasure in the physical world . The wheat and corn fields lining the road crackled in the summer heat or rustled in the wind with a sound like rain , and the sun reflecting off the pavement baked our cheekbones . Dust covered the ground , so thick sometimes it was choking , rising to turn our black shoes white , and we walked through it quietly for long hours , only our footsteps on the macadam making noise . We would both look up at the sudden shadow of a passing cloud or the silent flight of distant birds , and when we heard cars coming from a long way off we stood on the roadside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be from the pitch of their engines . Nelson suggested we wager on our guesses . Most times he won my carfare . Towards the end of that summer , I had started to call him Nitz . <p> All this we both liked without ever having to say so . I liked being with Nelson , equals for once , just the two of us on the road , searching for snakes and frogs and dropped treasures from cars . Occasionally , when we tired or saw storms moving towards us over the hills , we hitched a ride , but more often we walked through the rain , enjoying the steam rising from the pavement when the first drops hit and our clinging clothes and the streams beneath the bridges swelling and foaming in the sudden downpours . <p> Our walks came to an abrupt end in August when Father found out what we were up to . I 'm still not quite sure how . One humid morning Father pulled me into his office by my ear . Heavy curtains shut out the light and in the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell Father did n't release his grip , so that for a few seconds I seemed to be swinging in space by my ear . I gasped at the pain . <p> Father let go and stood looking down at me where I 'd fallen on the rug . " Your brother made you do this . " <p> " No , " I said , rubbing my ear . I knew what he was talking about but for a moment I could n't say anything , rocking on my knees to quiet the pain . Father never liked us to show we felt things . " It was n't like that at all . It was his idea , but I wanted to . I 'll repay all the money . We did n't do it for that . " I stood , cupping my ear . It was circled by a ring of pain , like fire , and the ring was pulsing . " I wanted to . " <p> " How much money ? " he said , looking at me . <p> " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the farm every week . It 's really not that much . I can repay you in a month . " <p> He did n't answer . He moved to his desk and pushed a glass ink bottle in and out of the desk lamp 's circle of light , slowly , the blue liquid sloshing up the bottle sides and leaving pale blue stains as it receded . This was his way when he was lost in thought , occupying his hands and ignoring whoever else was in the room . <p> Later , I sat on the curb , marking it with a hunk of chalk . Nelson came out , his face red and glowing . The skin looked as if it had been exposed to the sun for too long and then had four strips peeled off . Those were the marks from Father 's hand . I had heard some of the slaps over the lawn . <p> " Nitz , " I said , reaching for his arm . He pulled away and I chased after him . <p> " Nitz ! What happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground and Nelson was astride my back , pushing my face in the dirt . <p> " You know what happened , you bastard . You told him . " He kicked my legs with his heels . <p> Arching my neck to get my mouth out of the dirt , I said , " I did n't . I swear . " <p> " Did you tell him about the money ? " <p> " Yes , but he knew . " <p> He slammed my head down again . " Father said you told him everything . " Nelson punched me once and got off . The red on his face had intensified . Though I ran beside him , the chalk still gripped in my hand , he refused to listen to anything I said . He had learned that trait well from Father . <p> Lying in bed , my ear still sore , I realized there was the slightest chance that Nelson was right , that Father had pulled me in to his office to talk about something else  --  swimming in the lake with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had begun to do the week before  --  and that I 'd blurted out news of our walks prematurely . I did n't think anyone had seen us but I would never know , of course , because if I asked Father I might get us in trouble for something else and he would ignore the question , anyway . As for Nelson , he would always be sure of my betrayal . <p> Those roads we walked are gone now . Widened , abandoned , developed : I could n't walk them if I chose to , they exist only in my memory . Once , after Nelson died , I started to drive out to find them . On the way , after passing the first familiar building  --  a partially collapsed but still recognizable barn  --  I realized that too much had changed and if I drove the roads I would be driving them through my memories , changing them forever , and losing them as I had lost Nelson . I turned back without regrets . <p> For the rest of that tenth summer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father had us driven out to the farm . He made us repay a summer 's worth of trolley fares and it wiped out my savings . Nelson had none , but getting money was easy for him ; he played three rounds of golf with older men and won twice what he needed . <p> And sure that I 'd turned on him , Nelson removed himself from me every chance he got . Soon enough he was off on other schemes with older friends , stealing grapes from Wylie 's vineyard , swimming in the nearby abandoned quarries and canals , watching the servant girls take tub baths in their quarters , but I still wish those walks had never ended . Losing them was bitter then , and seems so even now . <p> On some of those nights ! went to Nelson , one of his feet cupped in my palm , I was tempted to tell him , " Nelson , you were wrong about me , I never betrayed us . Father already knew . " But I did n't . Nelson should never have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my brother , and because he was my brother I did not tell him he had been wrong . It would have served only to bring regret into his life at a time when he could do little to assuage it . For so long , he had been the protagonist in my life and I his shadow , and now it was my turn to shoulder some of the burden . So I held my tongue and worked on his painful feet until it was almost dark , and he was asleep or resting . <p> The sweet scent of vanilla grass , Hierochloe odorata , fills the air . The cemetery is quiet this morning  --  some birds , a squirrel chattering at my presence , the distant rumble of a jet . The early yellow sunlight slants onto the gravestones through the trees , shifting over them with the wind . I sit in the car a few moments , the door open , my shoes on the brick roadbed , and let the smell of the vanilla grass fill my lungs . <p> Sandra will like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfume . <p> Nine months of the year ! keep a small portable mower in my trunk ; Novembers I bring it into my basement , wash the housing , drain the fluids , and disassemble the engine parts , soaking them in oil to loosen the grime and dirt before drying and reassembling them . I discard the spark plug and oil filter and wrap the motor in a sheet to keep it dust-free , then reverse the process in the middle of each March . One year I catalogued forty-three different types of grasses in the grit , including a seed of the inaptly named meadow oat grass , Arrhenatherum elatius , which flourishes along the edges of deserts in the Southwest . I thought perhaps it had come this far north caught in the feathers of a migrating goose . Like all meadow oat seeds it had a twisted awn protruding from its back , which untwists and drives the seed beneath the soil when it rains . I moistened my palm and watched the seed try to bury itself in my skin . <p> Though the mower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each year . I have perhaps two or three more summers where I can use it , and now , before assembling the handle , I look over Abigail 's grave . Last week , what had been a cold spring gave way to ninety degree heat in mid-May , and the magnolia blossoms have come and gone . They are so thick on the ground I have the momentarily disconcerting impression that it has snowed on Abigail 's grave , and hers alone , or that her grave has been covered in lime . Cholera victims used to be marked off that way . At nighttime in this cemetery , I have read , ranks of their graves fairly glowed . <p> I walk to her grave and scoop up a handful of the silky magnolia petals , rub them between my fingers . Graves have their own lives . A bright birth attended with great fanfare , a long stretch of slowly decreasing attention , spans of forgetfulness , finally abandonment . Abigail 's grave , like her life , moved through these phases more quickly than most . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their favorite . They were not from here , and they bought a creekside plot  --  not an especially advantageous site  --  in a small dell in the cemetery . It is n't easily reached , and was n't then . I think they wanted to forget that she had died , not to forget her , but the practical results were the same . They stopped visiting before too long , and , as Abigail died before she was an aunt to nieces and nephews , none of them looked after her grave as they grew older . <p> It is not a particularly prepossessing place even now . Her parents planted the magnolia too near it , and it has never grown to any great height , so its low branches give too much shade and the covering vanilla grass is thin , even patchy . Still , I like it here . This grass blooms far earlier than other grasses and almost no one ever sees it flower , which is somehow fitting . The grass has other qualities , as well , though I admit I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swampy places and in wet meadows , and is the sweetest smelling of all grasses . In the South , Creoles make fans from it and Western Indians burned it ceremoniously . Nearer to home the local Indians used to weave the whole plant into screens , then dampen the screens and place them in a breeze to perfume the air . Even now , in northern European farming villages , villagers scatter vanilla grass before the churches on Saints days and holy festivals to make the pathways leading to saints ' shrines fragrant . There , they call it holy grass . <p> I have a busy morning , clearing vines from Abigail 's stone and applying a fertilizer mix to the yellowed grass , phosphates to thicken it , nitrogen to make it green . A year after Abigail died , I was sitting at the end of our dock at night . The noise and smoke of Nelson and Delia 's house party had made me claustrophobic , so I 'd wandered outside to get some fresh air . After a few minutes , when I 'd begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear behind it the quiet voice of the summer night  --  waves and crickets and rubbing branches on the shore  --  I heard footsteps thumping down the long dock towards me . Drunken , I guessed , from the way they hurried and stopped , wobbled , then went on , and soon enough Nelson called out to me , and when I turned he was waving a bottle and grinning . <p> " Morose , " he shouted . <p> I did n't answer , and he waited until he was right beside me and said , " Why are you always so morose these days ? " <p> I looked back over the water . A car was making its slow way down West Lake Road , and I watched its lights funneling through the darkness . Nelson fell into one of the Adirondack chairs beside me . <p> " Is it that damn Abigail thing ? " He leaned closer to me , his white teeth flashing , and I could smell the gin on his breath . " Do n't be stupid . " He held out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swigged from the bottle , emptying it , and threw it on the water , in front of where I sat . " You 're better off the way you are , you know . I mean , she was all right , if what you wanted was a life without much pleasure and a lot of boredom . " <p> He was still punishing me for something that had n't ever happened , all those years earlier , but because I still had that little sliver of doubt about my own complicity in what he saw as my betrayal , I sat there and took it . I watched the bottle bob away , ghostly white on the dark water , and wished he would leave . Nelson tapped his foot on the dock , keeping time with an up-tempo song the band had begun to play , and let his head loll back against the chair . I could feel his tapping reverberate up my spine . " Lots of stars , " he said , looking up at the sky , and it was true , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust cloud . " Thousands of them . Might make you believe in God . " <p> He leaned towards me again . " You do believe , do n't you ? I mean , I know I 've had my doubts . In fact , I never believed in God until you had that accident . " He sat back . " It was the best thing that ever happened to you . She was a ... " I dumped him into the lake , chair and all , before he could finish , one of the few times in my life I 've acted precipitously , and I have never regretted it . It was years before that comment ceased to burn , and even now , when I 'm at the club and hear someone drunk in the summer or the smell of spilled gin at the bar tickles my nose , I find it has n't completely healed . <p> Before gathering my tools , I look at the leather notebook , open in my palm , two creamy yellowed pages untouched as yet by ink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perhaps better left unknown . <p> For lunch I sit against a tree with a cheese sandwich and a thermos of iced coffee , . Mother 's favorite meal . High white cumulus drift across the blue sky , and reeds rattle over the stream in a warm breeze , shaking their fiat seeds on the water . They will float downstream and embed themselves in banks . My fingers take a few minutes to uncurl , habituated as they are to the hafts of tools , and I spread open the Kodak newsletter to read while I wait , anchoring the corners with shears and the sweating thermos . <p> The company is turning a profit once again , always a good sign . I worked there as an engineer for thirty years . I discovered ways to make faster film film that developed images with little light . Nelson was a banker , an investor , what they call in the papers now an entrepreneur . He made a lot of money . He was also an Olympic swimmer ; twice , he set world records . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing made him madder but it meant he was noticed , somebody , a face , a name people remembered . I never once received a letter from a stranger and few enough from friends . Even at Kodak my work went unheralded . <p> I first realized we were headed for different futures at Yale . Both Skull and Bones , I was probably the least likely member they ever had and he one of the likeliest . I know why they let me in . A year after Nelson graduated he came back for a dance . Standing in a smoky back hallway , fumbling with my cuffs before entering the crowded room , I overheard Nelson talking with a few of the upperclassmen , who told him they 'd inducted me only because of him . He laughed , adjusting his tie , and said he was n't surprised ; he 'd never thought me Skull and Bones material . I wondered even then if I was n't meant to overhear them , and about what I should do . If the situation had been reversed I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen from my face that I 'd heard . He was still adjusting his tie in the mirror , jutting his chin out to be sure the collar rested just so , and he said to his reflection words which were obviously intended for me . " Have n't you learned to lie yet ? " It seemed a point of honor with him that he had . <p> I was n't quite sure what he meant , but I took it to be comforting and let him lead me by the shoulder into the dance , and , though often burning with shame , stuck out three years in that club , an inch at a time . <p> Done with lunch I fold up the wax paper for reuse , bag it , then push up off the tree . I see myself for a moment walking towards the rest of our family stones as if I were a stranger crossing the dirt roads and meadows : crickets buzzing , the sun beating down , a white shirt almost glowing in the light , dust rising to cover my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can almost see their footsteps worn into the green grass . Early on , Nelson found the care ! took with graves morbid , a long attending on death . Nearer the end , studying stones , he seemed to think differently . He walked the cemetery 's rutted roads with me , evidently recalling his own childhood memories , asked questions about our more distant relatives , stopped often at the empty plot beside Delia 's . He was ready , I think . <p> I liked those walks , and that he came to rely on me . I helped plan his estate , the sale of his house and the distribution of those possessions he worried his daughters would fight over , made the arrangements for his funeral . He seemed to want me near him in the end , and no one else . Sandra came to see him twice , but he would n't let her in . Those last months , ! was the only one allowed to see him without his dentures . <p> The stones are brilliant white in the afternoon sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell reminds me of summer mornings outside our kitchen , the maids on their knees scouring the floor with the sudsy water , ranks of purple impatiens spilling over the walk . Nelson would take his bicycle from the garage and leave without saying goodbye . I keep up all the family graves  --  cousins , aunts , uncles , parents , nephews . Most of our family 's graves had fallen into disrepair when I started  --  it had been years since many had been cared for , decades for some . Toppled stones , chipped names and dates , stones grassed over completely . I started after Abigail 's death , researching where many of the people were buried , digging through aunts ' and uncles ' attics for family letters . I asked Nelson if he had any . He had n't . <p> There are Millards and Wentworths and Fafleys . I know about Gwyneth , who wanted to marry at thirteen , bowed to her parents ' objections , and married at fourteen . Twelve children later , aged twenty-six , she was dead . ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was illegible . Her parents built the largest mausoleum in the city . Nearby are other relatives ' graves . One , Porter Farley , left town for sixty years , living as a tramp , and was returned only after death . He appeared one evening at an inn near Woldoboro , Maine , gave a gold pocket watch as security against his lodging expenses , then declined supper and went upstairs to bed . The next morning , when food was brought to him , he refused it , saying that as he had no money he could not expect to eat . Six days later he died , probably from starvation . The innkeepers sold the watch and shipped him home . His sister , Mindwell , is buried nearby . She had a brief span of glory , three weeks as skipper of her husband 's ship . Two days out of Rio he died of yellow fever , as did the first mate , and she pickled his body in an unused beef barrel and took command of the ship , having learned navigation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one remove from her , displaced by her second husband . <p> This knowledge is not morbidity . If it were n't for me , no one would keep up the graves . And each of them , in some way , calls up memories . Now , when my knees are sore from kneeling , or the sun climbs high enough to make the day too hot , I sometimes pause in my rounds and try to remember not only my own but what I imagine to have been Nelson 's memories , as well . <p> It is a beautiful cool June Sunday and I am sitting in church . The men smell of talc and cologne , the women of lavender and roses . Sunlight streams through the stained-glass windows and looking up I feel like I am inside a jeweled box . When the breeze blows through the open church doors , it rattles the thin pages of my hymnal . <p> Singing the hymns , the minister 's high voice sends me into reverie . Aside from the war I traveled only twice , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both trips in the middle of winter so as to escape our dreadful weather . In Italy , in a small walled town in the Perugian hills , I stumbled across a museum dedicated to grasses . At first I thought I was imagining things . Except for the Latin terminology I could n't read the exhibits  --  I spoke no Italian  --  and the white-haired old woman in a black dress who took my money was either deaf or pretendin8 to be , but I photographed each display case and the plaques saying what they held , then had the photographs enlarged and translated when I returned home . <p> The day was warm and sunny when I entered the museum . I came out to a violet dusk , the stone buildings blue , water glimmering in the gutters after a shower , iron gratings rumbling as they closed . There was a fresh chill wind . I could n't believe my good fortune . I still have the pictures : a smoky vial of vernal grass perfume , clear glass made from melted wheat straw , topaz-yellow glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheaths lap successively left and right , just as the leaves are borne alternately on opposite sides of the stem . Technically , this is called two-ranked growth . One of the plaques discoursed on grass 's ubiquity and anonymity ; many things we do n't think of as grasses are  --  corn , wheat , oats , reeds , hay , moss-like grasses in cold countries , bamboo and sugarcane in hot . I do n't know who had built the museum , or why , but really it did n't matter . Some kindred spirit , I supposed , interested in what much of the world found uninteresting . It is odd connections such as that on which I am counting . <p> I have n't spent any of the money Father and Mother left me . I thought of setting up a fund to insure the upkeep of our graves , investing the principal and using the interest to pay a man to weed and trim the various graves a few times each year , but ! am gambling on Sandra to take up where I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I 've come to see it . Family is a loop you ca n't escape , and though at first I resisted that idea  --  almost resented it  --  I 've come to find comfort in it : the constancy even of things that make you raw . After Nelson . ' s funeral Sandra began asking questions . About him , about us , about our lives as children . She has Delia 's long-necked beauty . I remember the first stirrings of my own interest after a funeral in this same church years ago . The minister had just snuffed the altar candles and their smoke curled slowly towards the vaulted ceiling where the echoes of the minister 's voice and the mourners ' song and the organ 's bass notes still lingered like a presence , and I realized , seeing that transformation from flame to rising smoke , that the service imitated the soul 's birth and passage and ascension . It was as if a single string had suddenly vibrated with sound deep inside my chest . I always feel that same note now at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds where everything echoes  --  sights and sounds and memories  --  before people begin moving and talking , set loose again into the material world . <p> I had asked questions then , too . A few days ago , Sandra called again , asking if she could accompany me to see the graves , so this morning I am not surprised to see her here , her tanned face demurely hidden beneath a straw hat , her white teeth showing when she sings . In my jacket , I feel the notebook 's comforting solidity against my breast . This is not Sandra 's church , nor do I know if she is especially religious or even religious at all . I am gambling that her interest is genuine . Not gambling , really ; I have thought about it for a long time . Yes , I tell myself here in the church , listening to the Psalms  --  songs of captivity and return  --  Nelson was my brother and Sandra is my great-niece and Nelson was her grandfather , but those are just words and do little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Griner , a recipient of the Mary Roberts Rinehart Award , has published stories in quarterlies and in The Graywolf Annual Four . <p>
