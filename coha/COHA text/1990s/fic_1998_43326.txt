Tread lightly At any moment , the earth might open up . Photograph <p> IMAGINE YOU ARE driving around southern Georgia with your family . It is early morning , and it is summer . Dew clings to the undersides of forest leaves , rejuvenating the air you breathe . As you drive , you ca n't help but fall prey to dewy hope . Let 's say you have a wife and three children who have turned out to be just as lovely as anyone could expect . You 've always felt lucky to be surrounded by a family like this . Let 's say you 're driving , and with a purpose . A destination , a patch of brown on the map , guides your hand , the steering wheel , your foot , the gas pedal . At Lumpkin , you make a right , then a left , then another right . You 're at the edge of a small town , ready to travel seven miles down a narrow highway to your destination , but you pause at the weathered metal sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by rain , by tourists " fingers . You scan the sign because the children are hungry . By now , the morning dew has evaporated . It 's July , and the insects sound like electricity . " Providence Canyon . . . 1,100 acres with sixteen different canyons up to two hundred feet deep . . . Originally the backyard of a nineteenth-century farmer , Providence Canyon was the result of poor agricultural techniques . . . soft soils . . . Erosion left ditches three to five feet deep . . . continued to grow over the years . . . Heavy rains have removed as many as six feet of canyon floor in one night . . . swallowed hundreds of acres of farmland , including a schoolhouse and a home occupied by a Georgia family for two generations . Today , visitors can take a three-mile scenic trail which . . . " Your mouth goes dry at the word family . The kids bounce in the backseat , calling for hot dogs , so you drive down the heat-rippled highway . At the park , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms windmilling , toward the playground . You walk over to inspect the swing sets and the teeter-totter , which seem dangerously close to the canyon 's edge . " Teetering , " you whisper . A pulsing vein branches across your forehead , and you raise your fingers to rub it away . A wooden fence skirts the rim of Providence Canyon , the ground dropping off just inches beyond its posts . In places , the erosion has eaten so far inland that some sections of the fence dangle out in space , two hundred feet above the canyon floor . You call to your children . Now , INSTEAD OF A hot , worried father , let 's imagine you are someone else . You have worked as a shortorder cook for the past fifteen years . You 're missing the tip of a pinkie finger , and your eyebrows have been singed off . Let 's say you are contentedly cooking hot dogs on one of the park 's rusted barbecue grills at high noon on this oven-hot day . You 're whistling because you 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here many times before . This place always makes you feel like whistling . You turn the hot dogs just like you would back at the diner where you work , except here you leave them on the grill a little longer than usual . The taste of black char makes you think of neighborhoods , childhood , and a whole mess of other old-fashioned virtues that end with hood . The smoke from your grill drifts down over the lip of the canyon like the fog that runs along the floor when you open the diner 's walk-in freezer . You leave the food to blacken , and you follow the smoke to the edge of the canyon . The Georgia sun is setting . It 's the color of a blood-stained egg yolk . When it strikes the bright soil of Providence Canyon , the light intensifies . You 've never been to Arizona 's Grand Canyon-never been beyond Alabama , in fact ( folks like to call you Bubba , and you let them ) - but looking at the illuminated clay , you know how all those tourists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the visitor center several times , listened to the naturalist , pondered the sepia photographs of a farmer standing next to the puzzling ditch that formed overnight in his field . First came the trickles of erosion , then the great slabs of earth falling away when groundwater started looking for an exit . You 've never been to the Arctic Ocean , but you 've heard about glaciers calvingskyscrapers of blue ice crashing into the water . As the earth vanished , a strange thing happened in Providence Canyon : Dozens of formations composed of forty-three different erosion-resistant soils were left standing in the middle of the canyon , like i5o-foot cathedral spires of pink , orange , and white . Pine trees , spindly but green , still flourish at the crests of certain outcroppings . Seasonal rainstorms still squall into Georgia from the ocean and erode the edges of the canyon , cutting new gullies and raking noticeable tracks along the soft slopes . The canyon grows by as much as six feet each year . You know these things as fact , because the naturalist at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious man-in fact , you swear a blue streak when grease splatters the backs of your hands at the diner-but looking at the white ridges of calcified soil in the red late-afternoon sun , you notice they are as transparent as angels " wings . FORGET THE COOK . Let 's say you teach English at a local community college . Though you still take pleasure in circling misplaced modifiers on your students " papers , lately you 've felt an ache at the base of your skull . You moved to Georgia less than two years ago from your hometown in the Rocky Mountains . Money was the issue . Now , as a teacher , there 's something just not right with your life . Maybe it 's the garbage can neatly centered under the pencil sharpener , the windowless fluorescence , the way the desks are arranged . Maybe it 's the four walls themselves . So , on the spur of the moment , you 've come to Providence Canyon . Back at the community college , you wear a necktie every day . Your wife says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Providence Canyon , she can find no reason to complain , because you 're wearing jeans and a T-shirt with a hole in the left shoulder . The silk-screened mountains and letters across your chest-GET HIGH ON THE TETONS-are half faded . A trail leads to the bottom of the canyon . You and your wife follow it . As the two of you descend , the wind carries the fresh scent of pine , the rustle of dried leaves , and birdsong . The trees are widely spaced but broadbranched , so there is continuous overhead cover . You love the sounds of the names given to the vegetation : magnolia , mimosa , hydrangea , sparkleberry . The shade cools your skin . The leaves along the trail crackle like ice . There are red flowers , ranging from salmon to deep scarlet , on all sides , and you remember the naturalist in the visitor center telling you to keep your eyes peeled for the rare plumleaf azalea , which grows along the streams after rainstorms . There are armadillos and miniature frogs here . The frogs jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly , you bring your cupped hands around a perched frog . . . but at the moment before capture , it shoots between your palms . Your wife squeals , and you feel yourself laugh for the first time in days . You descend deeper into the shade . On the canyon walls , you take note of the prehistoric time zones : first Tertiary , then Cretaceous . You breathe deeply . At the top of the trail , you 've left the four walls , the chalk-dust handprints on your pants , the monotonous buzz of fluorescence . You know you 'll have to reshoulder this wornsome baggage on your way out . You pause along the trail and think about the canyon 's formation one hundred years ago , and suddenly it hits you . The park is a monument to subtraction . You are only an English teacher , but you know enough about mathematics to know that subtraction is a principle of life . A good principle or a bad principle , depending on how you look at it . The natural processes at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in your own life , you must start to extract the detritus from your soul , remove the gritty soil of clock-punching life . This fills you with a hope you have n't felt in years . You are like a fat man on a diet who swears he can just feel those pounds melting away . LET 'S SHIFT GEARS and make you a soldier . Not a hard , combat-bitter one but a young one whose first assignment is at a small army headquarters in Atlanta . You have a desk job and spend most of your time saluting officers rather than squeezing triggers . When you step outside your office door , you can hear the city 's bullet-shaped transit trains roaring past . So imagine you 're this young , soft soldier standing at the end of the trail at the bottom of the canyon . You 've just emerged from the shade into the bright rays of sunset . The trail disappears at your feet into the loose sand of a gully . The naturalist , the one who told you about the azalea blossoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canyon in a loop . You had looked forward to following a defined trail , one that would lead you somewhere and faithfully return you to the beginning . You see nothing at your feet but eroding sand . You cross the dry gully , hoping to pick up the trail in the thick tangle of pine trees and laurel bushes on the other side . The ground slopes up sharply here , the trees thinning at the top of the rise and disappearing at the base of the sculpted soil outcropping . You push your way through brambles , fallen pines , kudzu vines . Photograph <p> There is no trail . Or , if there is , you ca n't find it . Like everything else , the canyon has eaten it . You lean against a pine to catch your breath , and your hand comes away sticky with sap . You make a fist and pound the bark , trying to remember what you were taught in your land-navigation course last summer . Basic training was twenty weeks long , and it cost the taxpayers 15,000 just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A sharp crack echoes through the woods . You crouch instinctively , your mind racing to snipers in Third World jungles . But when you peer around the tree , you see it 's only an armadillo hopping through the leaves , popping branches . You jump up and give chase , leaping kudzu snares and dodging deadfall piles . You 're gaining on the armadillo when suddenly , like the trail , he vanishes . Does everything in this place disappear ? Your breath tears at your throat . You scan the side of the hill . He could n't have just . . . Then you see what appears to be a clay-colored snake sticking out of a hole . The armadillo has buried himself headfirst in an abandoned den and , thinking he 's completely hidden , is holding very still . Slowly , you reach out your hand to grab the ropelike tail . You 've almost touched the hard , dry scales when you remember this animal has claws that can strip the flesh from your forearm in a matter of seconds . You withdraw your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot . The armadillo shifts , scrunching deeper into the hole . You laugh , but the laugh goes nowhere , evaporates in the hungry canyon . You remember the allegories that the English teacher at the community college tried to teach you . If he were here , he 'd compare this geography to a mouth-the pink lining of the cheeks , the sharp points of the teeth . You are standing in the very throat of Providence . Suddenly , danger seems to be everywhere . Kudzu coils around your ankles . When you look around , you realize you 're much higher up on the hill than you 'd thought . Just ahead is a cone-shaped talus slope glittering with chips of mica and , above that , a gleaming red-purple-orange-white cathedral of soil rising skyward from the canyon floor . Now YOU ARE the twenty-sevenyear-old son of a Baptist minister . You were raised in an atmosphere of good and evil-sharp lines , like layers of sediment , marked their differences . You stand at the base of the multicolored cliff . The soil , deeply furrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the crest is a thin pine tree with seven branches . You count each branch . The roots look like white knuckles as they grip the knob of the ridge . The tree , undercut by erosion , leans out over the canyon floor 15o feet below . Its hold is so fragile that the next squall blowing in from the Atlantic might just send it splintering to the gully below . Even the rays of the sunset could topple it . The earth once covered this space like a sea , and the canyon has been stripped of all but the most durable soils , the ones most resistant to wind and water : the ore , the mica , the clay . The sand , the silt , the topsoil webbed with hair-thin roots-these are the disposable details of the canyon . Your father , the great orator-preacher , would like this place if he ever saw it . He could draw three or four sermon illustrations from it . The word providence . You 've heard your father say it from the pulpit many times . Providence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . in 1840 who surveyed , plowed , planted , and harvested his land two hundred feet above where you now stand . Maybe he was down on his luck , had a couple bad years of cotton . So , in a gamble for more productive acreage , he razed the trees on his land . Every last tree . In the spring , the rain had nowhere to go but into the soil , which , coincidentally , was smack-dab over a weak spot on the earth 's crust . A flaw in the bedrock . A geologic fluke . You picture the look on his face when he saw the plowed furrows on his land turn to ditches and those ditches to trenches five feet deep in just a matter of years . Then you think about the earth caving in on itself , swallowing the schoolhouse and the two-generation home . You slide down the talus slope , sprint across the gully , and find the path back to the canyon 's rim . The soil crumbles under your feet at the trailhead , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last two feet of the trail . You take your wife by the hand and call your children off the playground equipment . Once everything is packed in the carkids , ice chest , hot-dog buns-you leave the park . You drive just a little faster on the trip home , pursued by the sound of the canyon widening . And all these voices inside you-the father , the cook , the teacher , the soldier , the sonagree it is a beautiful , dangerous sound . The sound of a crumbling life . You can hear the whisper of each falling grain .
