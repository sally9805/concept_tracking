The sun , once again , shined brightly on the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) as it celebrated its 87th Annual Convention illustrating that , indeed , it 's a new day . Evidence : The nation 's oldest civil rights organization , long beloved by Black 1960s icons and powerbrokers , showed signs of growing ever more popular with younger Blacks , a major convention objective . A reported 4,000 delegates were among the 10,000 conventioneers gathered in Charlotte , NC , for the six-day confab . There was also the exciting reception for the organization 's new leadership , President Kweisi Mfume and Board of Directors Chairwoman Myrlie EversWilliams . And most noticeably , Mfume and EversWilliams kept saying , again and again , " it 's a new day begun .

Benjamin Chavis , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regain its former luster . " Go tell it on the mountain that the old ways and the old days are over , " Mfume said in his opening remarks . " We are going to fight discrimination , not each other ... we will challenge evil and darkness wherever we find it . " Racism , sexism , bigotry , and most recently , the rash of Black church burnings in the South , must not be tolerated , Mfume told the crowd .

As such , it was most appropriate that the organization chose as its theme " it 's a new day begun , " which is a variation of a verse in the Black national anthem , Lift Every Voice and Sing . President Clinton also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " during his much-cheered speech at the convention . " What a difference a year makes , " said the president . " Last year you announced your new leadership , a new sense of partnership , a new spirit of commitment to go into the 21st century .... I want to thank you for making your voice heard again , for economic justice , for the empowerment of all voters , for educational excellence for our children . And I want to thank you especially for your effort to bring young people back into this organization and into the citizenship in America . " While Clinton chose to accept the organization 's invitation to address conventioneers , his Republican rival , Bob Dole , was a no-show , initially citing a scheduling conflict which put him in Richmond , VA , and attending baseball 's All-Star game in Philadelphia .

" After being chided for not attending the convention , Dole said , " They do n't tell me about every invitation . We got a conflict ; we ca n't do everything . That 's no big deal . " He added : " The important thing is that I have a flawless civil rights record and the head of the NAAC sic is a very liberal Democrat , and I think he was trying to set me up . " After hearing about Dole 's remarks concerning his political leanings , Mfume responded : " I do not believe it is important whether Bob Dole thinks I 'm his friend or not , but rather what we can do to help our country .... Several Republicans have expressed frustration at the Dole campaign for not arranging his schedule to allow him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not try to impugn their character also . " But there was more to the convention than who was present and who was not present . The organization moved forward on some important matters . They included : Photograph V Mfume talks with Rep. Mel Watt ( l ) , D-NC , and North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt before the start of the first plenary session . // * The NAACP 's debt , which nearly topped more than $3 million two years ago , has been reduced to less than $1 million , said Mfume. * Keeping with his commitment to attract younger Blacks , Mfume hired a new national youth director . A new chief financial officer was also hired . The organization 's long-term goal is to build a $50 million endowment to give the NAACP financial independence . * The organization unveiled its web site found at ( http:Jl/www.naacp.org ) , which offers information about the organization and an opportunity for Internet users to join the NAACP electronically . * The organization is also in the midst of what it says is its most extensive voter registration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to register 1 million new voters . The organization also passed a host of resolutions , including one that vowed to raise its presence in defense of affirmative action and to press for greater emphasis on education and rehabilitation in the juvenile justice system . Also workshops were held on everything from Black church burnings in the South to extremist group activities across the country . Progress was made during the sixday convention . That was evident . As Evers-Williams pointed out in her address to conventioneers at the Charlotte Convention Center , America " does not know which direction it is headed in . We as firefighters must guide it in the right direction . " <p>
