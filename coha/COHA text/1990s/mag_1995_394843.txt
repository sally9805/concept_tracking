To some the Sun sits in the sky like a yellow beach ball , just a barrier to lunar , planetary and deep-sky observing . But instead of considering it a hindrance , why not make it an observing target ? With the proper equipment and techniques , the nearest star comes alive with thousands of minute features gleanable with eye or camera . Better yet , daytime observing does n't require dark adaptation or red flashlights , nor do neighborhood streetlights pose a problem . That alone makes solar observing and photography more convenient ; it 's something to do during a lunch hour . In what follows , we will look at ways to observe the Sun and photograph it and then discuss what features to look for . But first , a word of warning : Never directly observe the Sun without proper eye protection ! Materials that look like they filter sunlight  --  sunglasses , smoked glass , or window tinting material  --  do n't block harmful infrared radiation . Worse yet are filters that thread into eyepieces , the kind included with many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filters and blind a hapless observer instantly . What is the safest way to look at the Sun ? Commercially available solar filters that slide over the front of the telescope objective are safe and effective . Another observing technique , image projection , is cheaper than filters . READY ... AIM ... PROJECT Before starting any solar observing session , cap the scope 's finder so intensified sunlight wo n't burn wayward eyes or shirts that happen to get near its focus . In lieu of a finder , aim the telescope by making its shadow on the ground appear as small as possible ; then slip in a low-power eyepiece . Image projection does n't require looking at the Sun directly . Instead , an eyepiece projects the image onto a screen . something as simple as a sheet of white paper . ( Unless you 've got steady hands , use a frame to hold the screen . ) " Stopping down " ( covering ) a portion of the telescope aperture tones down image intensity . Sunglasses also reduce eyestrain caused by looking at a bright image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Kellner , because solar heat can damage an expensive eyepiece 's coatings or the cement that holds its components together . If you use binoculars , check with the manufacturer to be sure internal components wo n't outgas or melt in the intense heat collected by the objective lens . With the projection technique , more magnification generates a dimmer image . So you need to shield the screen from direct sunlight to spot fainter details . To get a closer look at a detail , switch to an eyepiece with a shorter focal length or move the screen farther from the eyepiece . A FILTERED VIEW If juggling eyepieces , a telescope , and a projection screen does n't seem like fun , observe the Sun directly through a solar filter mounted on the front of your telescope . Solar filters keep high intensity sunlight out of the telescope , which reduces the chance of damaging components and minimizes air turbulence inside the tube caused by heating . There are three types of commercial filters available : dyed glass , metal-coated plastic , and metal-coated glass . Dyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ask for welder 's glass shade No. 14 , an extremely dark , green filter that few sources of light , save the Sun , can penetrate . Shade No. 14 is a rather specialized glass for a welding shop to stock  --  do n't be surprised if they have to special-order it . These filters come in standard sizes of 2 x 4-1/4 inches , perfectly sized to cover a pair of eyes ( cover your eyes first and then look for the Sun ! ) , and 4-1/2 x 5-1/4 inches , a reasonable size for the front end of a small telescope ( be sure it covers the entire front aperture and is mounted securely so a flash of sunlight does n't blind you ) . While dyed glass is well suited for casual observing , it is not optical-quality glass and may not produce sharp enough images for high-resolution photography or high-power observing . The second type of filter has a layer of aluminum applied to a mylar base . Commercial mylar filters actually have two layers of metal-coated base so that any pinholes in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer . Some do-it-yourselfers purchase aluminized mylar separately and cut it to fit a needle-point ring ( available in many sizes from handicraft shops ) . Though images in these filters are a cold blue , they are very good because the base does n't distort incoming light . A third type of filter , the most expensive mentioned thus far , is metal-coated glass . These filters have nickel and chromium or other metals coated onto a piece of glass . Images in these filters are typically yellow or orange , colors some people find more pleasing than the blue or green images produced by mylar and dyed glass filters . Check with the manufacturer to be sure the coated surface of the filter is on the side facing the telescope rather than the side facing the sky . The former protects the delicate surface coating a little better . PHOTOGRAPHING THE SUN Filtered telescopes work best for doing photography . By simply shooting prime focus through the telescope , it 's very easy to capture a full-disk view of the Sun . Working with an f/10 or f/11 telescope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film 's speed ( 1/ASA ) . For example , exposures with 100 speed film and a typical f/10 Schmidt-Cassegrain would bracket around an optimal shutter speed of 1/125 second . Schmidt-Cassegrain users need to remember one factor before firing the shutter . SCTs have a curved focal plane , which means an image focused in the center of the field of view is slightly out of focus at the edges . Faced with this reality , critical focus should center on the feature of interest . Less sharp features can be cropped out in the final print . For more advanced photographers , some manufacturers make filters designed specifically for high resolution picture-taking . These filters transmit more light than a standard visual filter and allow for shorter exposures that " freeze " moments of steady atmospheric seeing . These filters are dangerous to look through since they transmit 10 times more light than standard filters . Focus and center a particular solar feature with a standard filter before switching to a high transmission filter . Besides conventional still cameras , video and CCD cameras also work well for solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , capturing events such as solar rotation , the slow evolution of sunspots , the explosion of a flare , and the rapid eruption of a prominence . The only challenge to shooting video is attaching the camera to the telescope and selecting the right eyepiece to project the image into the camera 's lens . While CCD cameras are lighter and plug directly into the eyepiece holder , a potential pitfall is their sensitivity . You may need more filtering to prevent overexposure with even their shortest shutter times . For both video and CCDs , a rock-steady mount is necessary to maintain pointing accuracy . TOWARD A STEADY SUN The steadier the atmosphere , the more you 'll see and photograph ; the right observing site reduces the chances for poor seeing . An ideal site overlooks a large area that has constant temperature , a lake or grassy field for example . Sites near parking lots and rooftops are likely to have poor image stability because of the heat they generate . Time of day is also an important factor ; views are sharper in the early morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same temperature as the surrounding air . Contrast is just as important as sharpness . An image with good contrast is vastly improved if the telescope 's optics are cleaned before solar observing . Dust and dirt on the optics conspire to reduce the contrast of the image . Clean optics are especially important when looking for subtle features like solar prominences . Contrast also suffers when there are thin clouds in front of the Sun , so keep an eye on the sky . And do n't forget to check the solar filter ; pinholes in the coating of a solar filter let in flashes of bright sunlight , which reduce contrast . Cover these holes with black paint . Stray light can also be a problem . To block it , slip a rubber eyecup on the eyepiece or drape a black hood over your head . Try building a small sunshade to keep direct sunlight from falling on your face while looking through the eyepiece . An even bigger sunshade would keep both you and the telescope in shadow . As with all observing , comfort helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during winter , you can get quite hot while observing the Sun . With this in mind , wear light-colored , lightweight clothing . HERE COMES THE SUN When all the elements line up  --  clean optics , a good filter , an excellent site , clear skies , and comfort  --  you 'll be astounded at what the Sun 's photosphere ( its visible surface ) looks like . Your first view may be surprising : the Sun 's edge , called the limb , roils and boils . This is the churning of Earth 's atmosphere , not a display of solar activity . Ignore the wavy disk edge and look instead just inside the limb . Compare this area with the center of the Sun 's disk . Notice the limb is darker , an effect called limb darkening . This occurs because light from the center of the disk does n't travel through as much of the Sun 's atmosphere to reach us as light that comes from the limb . In addition to limb darkening , you may notice some medium or large sunspots . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the rest of the photosphere ) . They range in size from a few thousand to tens of thousands of kilometers across . Sunspots contain intense magnetic fields that reach several thousand gauss ( Earth 's field is about 0.5 gauss ) and change in size and shape daily as turbulent gases swirl around and within them . Try to guess which sunspots will last the two weeks it takes them to cross the Sun 's face . Use sunspots to measure the Sun 's rotation and figure out how it varies with solar latitude . While individual sunspots sometimes appear , they usually form in groups . The darkest part of a spot is the umbra ; several sunspots together may be surrounded by a lighter penumbra . Other features surrounding sunspots are faculae , tiny patches that appear brighter than other portions of the photosphere . Faculae are always present but are seen best around sunspots near the limb . The region where sunspots form moves as well . Over the course of an 11-year sunspot cycle , they not only vary in number , size , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At sunspot minimum ( the Sun 's coming out of one now ) , they form close to 30deg latitude . Over the course of a few years , they originate closer to the equator . In steady seeing you 'll see pores scattered on the photosphere , small darkenings only a few seconds of arc or less across ( 1 " is about 1,000 km at the Sun 's distance ) . Pores usually disappear in a few hours ' time but sometimes grow into large sunspots . Granules are another delicate feature with limited lifetimes . Under good seeing , they appear as a low contrast rice-grain pattern across the disk . Granules are the sites of hot , rising material in the Sun 's topmost layer . ( Similar convective cells appear in a pot of very hot oatmeal . ) But when it comes to looking for detail , a hydrogen-alpha filter opens up a whole new star for study ( see " The Sun in a Different Light , " opposite ) . In H alpha light , sunspot numbrae may look simpler , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the umbra . Other features seen in white light look different in H alpha light . Faculae , the small , bright patches seen around sunspots in white light in H alpha , are referred to as plage . Plages are active regions that linger long after the sunspots they are associated with disappear . In these active regions , strong magnetic fields sometimes twist and distort to the breaking point , generating an explosive brightening called a solar flare . Solar flares in H alpha linger between a few minutes and a few hours . Looking at the Sun 's limb under high magnification in H alpha shows what are called spicules , hairlike threads that stick up for minutes at a time . Arcing high above the spicules are clouds of gas supported by magnetic fields in the chromosphere called prominences ( calling them flares is incorrect ) . Prominences have a variety of forms and shapes , such as simple clouds , flames , hedgerows , and loops . When seen against the disk , prominences appear as dark streaks called filaments . Filaments and prominences come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months at a time with few changes and then in the course of a few minutes suddenly rise upward and dissipate . Flares are associated with these changes . Some prominences simply take off into space , dissipating as they join the solar wind . Sometimes the foot of the prominence remains attached to the chromosphere while the other end blows away . A prominence that starts moving upward only to fall back to the Sun is called a surge . In H alpha or white light , the Sun offers plenty of opportunity for both observing and photography . Since its face changes from day to day , no two observing sessions are ever the same . Best of all , with solar observing there are no late night hours to compete against the requirements of family and job . Whether you make a quick , eye-protected glance to check sunspot numbers or spend hours making detailed studies of faculae or prominences , the reward of solar observing is a better understanding of our star .
