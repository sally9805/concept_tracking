<p> In response to the Sun-Times Sept. 13 editorial , " Riley Agenda Looks Promising , " I would like to discuss some key features of the administration 's " Improving America 's Schools Act " that eliminate unintended disincentives to educational success in current Chapter 1 law . <p> Chapter 1 funds are intended to help increase the achievement level of educationally deprived children to a point where they should no longer require Chapter 1 services . Yet , the allocation of Chapter 1 funds to a district 's highest-poverty schools is currently based on the number and needs of educationally deprived children in such schools . Those Chapter 1 schools that realize success with their Chapter 1 participants can ironically lose a portion of their funds the next year . The administration 's Title 1 proposed legislation would fix the problem by requiring that allocation of Title 1 funds be based on the level of poverty in a school , as opposed to educational deprivation . <p> The administration 's bill not only removes disincentives , but adds incentive for success . Under the plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also to reward districts and schools that are successful in helping their students meet high state standards . Schools that are successful for three consecutive years in making what the state regards as adequate progress toward meeting high standards will be designated " Distinguished Schools . " <p> The major goal of the administration 's legislation is to help schools provide a quality education that will enable all children , including those who are currently the farthest behind , to meet the same high performance standards that all children will be expected to meet . By using our resources in ways that make sense and expecting the best from all our nation 's children , we can expect our nation to excel . <p> Richard W. Riley , secretary , <p> U.S. Department of Education <p> Invisible Problem <p> Michelle Stevens deserves commendation for her column ( " IllitIs a Road to Joblessness , " Sept. 27 ) highlighting adult illiteracy . For many Chicagoans , illiteracy is an invisible problem . Yet , as she points out , 650,000 of our fellow citizens are unable to read . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor speak English . <p> Fortunately , groups such as Literacy Chicago , working in cooperation with community organizations and institutions , provide classes , tutoring , and other educational services for adults . The City Colleges of Chicago also has a key role , providing free classes in literacy and English-as-a-Second Language . More than 31,000 adults are already enrolled this semester , with students continuing to register . <p> During the two months since I became chancellor , I have looked carefully at our adult education program . Frankly , there is reason to believe that at some locations  --  especially at smaller sites  --  we fall short of ensuring the services these students require : classes at graded skill levels , counseling and support services . In this period of declining funding , this problem , along with others , must be addressed by redirecting existing resources . The strategy we are following is to refer students from small sites , where instruction at varying skill levels often must be taught in the same class , to sites large enough to provide grades , classes and student services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education at these sites . While this appears to some as cutting back of the program , our intent and hope is to provide considerably better services to a comparable number of students . <p> As Stevens indicates , the prospects are bleak for students who can not read and write . In fact , there 's increasingly strong evidence that at least two years of education beyond high school will be required for most employment in the years ahead . This point confirms students ' need for a solid foundation of literacy  --  and for providing students with educational momentum through and beyond literacy training so that they can progress into the world of greatly increased opportunities that higher education provides . <p> Ronald J. Temple , chancellor , <p> City Colleges of Chicago <p> Sick Humor <p> As a mother of two children ages 3 and 8 months , I was appalled at Richard Roeper 's column titled " Barney Burnouts Get Their Licks In  --  Lyrically " ( Sept. 28 ) . It 's pretty apparent , first of all , that Roeper is not a parent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to draw audiences over the age of about 8 . Secondly , if he were a parent of small children , he would know how invaluable it is to have your toddler-aged children sit quietly in front of the television for 30 minutes or so to allow you to pick up the house or even be able to take your morning shower ! <p> I think it 's great that impressionable children can watch a program that teaches them how to clean up their toys , respect their parents , share their belongings , and eat healthy foods as well as not to be afraid of the dark , thunderstorms or going to the doctor . " Barney " is a very positive role model for toddler-aged children , and , as parents , we find that little children will listen to these role models much more readily than they will us ! <p> The part of Roeper 's column that I found hideous was the lyrics to the " I Love You " song . If he feels these lyrics are to be compared with telling other little kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly lost his perspective . These lyrics are indicative of how violent children are becoming and at such a young age ! <p> When I was a child I never even thought of such violence ! I do n't know how Roeper can find this " sick humor " amusing , much less print these lyrics . Was n't he the one to print , in the past , columns on senseless , random violence and gun control ? If our children are thinking about killing TV characters such as " Barney " at these ages , what will they be thinking five years from now ? <p> Gloria Bokenkamp , Oak Lawn <p> No Savings <p> In the Nation Briefings column ( Oct. 1 ) , a paragraph stated cuts were made by President Clinton in his staff by laying off 109 people and by attrition and retirement . That sounds good . But then the article said 87 of these people were given other jobs in the government . <p> So where is the savings ? <p> The burden of proof lies with President Clinton to show why Rep. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut " basically a lie . " Who is fooling whom ? <p> Jay Contorer , Deerfield <p> Odd Dream <p> Recently , I had a strange dream . My neighbor and I were standing at the edge of a pool of water . I saw fish in the water . I looked closer and realized they were big puppies , not fish at all . One big puppy was on the back of another . I asked my neighbor what was going on ? She said their owner was sick and could no longer take care of them . <p> I remembered there was a law about cruelty to animals . My neighbor was looking on in sadness . We knew that all the big puppies would die eventually , if we did nothing . <p> I wondered what this dream meant . Then I reflected on what is happening to children in our area , and was able to see what it meant . <p> The pool of water was our schools . The puppies were our children . The owner of the puppies was the Legislature , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The puppy that was on the back of another was the pupil that could afford a better education . The law is the state Constitution , which requires the state to be responsible for the education of children . <p> I and my neighbor were the parents of the puppies . The owner 's sickness was a really bad one . The reality is that the state will do more for the dogs than for children . Who are the dogs ? <p> Patricia Farkas , Cicero <p> Call It Camel <p> If Clinton 's plan for the government to enter into a consortium to produce a politically correct automobile becomes reality , I 'd suggest the model it parents us with be named the Camel . Remember , an extremely savvy satirist appropriately identified a camel as a horse produced by a committee . <p> G. P. Lucchetti , Oak Park @x WHEN MY OLDEST SON WAS A Boy Scout in England 20 years ago , I once watched his troop play a game in which the boys formed a circle around a troop leader holding a soccer ball . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random , saying as he did so either " head " or " catch . " If he said " head , " the boy was supposed to catch it ; if he said " catch , " the boy was supposed to head it . Anyone who slipped up and caught the ball when instructed to catch it or head the ball when instructed to head it was out and had to leave the circle . Eventually , only one scout was left standing . That boy , as I have often had occasion to think since , must have been one of nature 's ironists . He and the others had certainly had an education in the central principle of all ironic- and , for that matter , non-ironicdiscourse , namely that meaning depends on context . A boy who 'd said that he would just love to play such a game could have meant either that he 'd love to play it or that he 'd absolutely hate it , and all but the most literal-minded would have been able to tell which it was on hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read that context , to pick up the cues indicating irony or its absence , depends on a certain degree of social skill and experience in complex social interactions . Irony , that is , belongs to the world of face-to-face communication , even when we encounter it in a book or a movie . If we are able to recognize the irony in fictional contexts it is because we have previously experienced it , or something like it , in real ones . Maybe that 's why , as we have begun to spend more and more of our time interacting with each other remotely and electronically , rather than face-to-face , it seems that our irony-reading skills have tended to atrophy , or else to go haywire . This is producing , on the one hand , a leaden literalism or , on the other , the sort of paranoia which supposes that everything must mean something other than what it says . The latter is the world of the postmodern critic , that master figure of the popular culture , in which everything is assumed to be ironic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - as they are now called- of cartoon and movie franchises , such as this spring 's oStar Trek and X-Men . The fans of both have always been ironists , and so they are naturally open to new " readings " of these classics . In fact they delight in them . If you were never the victim of the nave illusion that Captain James T. Kirk was a real person in the first place , you are unlikely to mind that he has become yet another simulacrum of a person . But-call me crazy- I keep looking for signs of the culture 's reaction against ironical excess . Ten years ago , a young man named Jedediah Purdy , then still in his twenties and home-schooled by hippies in West Virginia , wrote a book titled For Common Things that was an attack on the ironic culture as he saw it then- before there was any Daily Show or Colbert Report and nothing worse than David Letterman or Seinfeld to give irony a bad name . Ironically , the anti-irony screed enjoyed a certain vogue . The New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated this backwoodsman and recent Harvard graduate as a reincarnation of H. D. Thoreau , or perhaps a sort of humorless version of Abraham Lincoln , destined for greatness by his call for a return to what he imagined were the rustic simplicities of our forefathers . Of all the silly things to be against , irony must be among the silliest . It is like being against algebra . Irony is simply a rationalization of the way the world- in this case the rhetorical world- works , and has always worked . But people could sympathize with the sort of social insecurity that must have lain behind Mr. Purdy 's attachment to puritanical plainspeaking , and , with the help of the New York Times , the book made enough of a splash that that gentleman , now a law professor at Duke University , has lately written another , even sillier book . It is called A Tolerable Anarchy and is a tract on behalf of liberal utopianism . I see it as a sort of sequel , which must have grown out of the earlier book 's implied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its confusing imperfections . Two decades before his denunciation of irony and a few years before my son was inducted into the scouts , Terry Jones of Monty Python fame , a champion ironist who was also a part-time medievalist , wrote a book called Chaucer 's Knight : The Portrait of a Medieval Mercenary , which purported to show that the man described in the Prologue to The Canterbury Tales as a parfit gentil knight was in fact a brutal and cold-blooded killer with nothing chivalric about him . In fact , Mr. Jones was pretty sure that there was nothing chivalric about medieval chivalry itself . The arguments over his detailed evidence for this shocking proposition have gone on for nearly three decades without anyone 's thinking to ask what would have been the point of Chaucer 's encoding the truth about his knight so successfully that it took some six centuries for a TV comedian to decode it . But then , in the lit-crit biz as it is practiced today , such questions simply do n't arise . Irony is pretty much self-justifying and , without it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground . In a recent issue of The Chronicle of Higher Education , an English professor at the University of Virginia admitted as much in the course of a quixotic call for a moratorium on " readings " - that is , the critical application of one of the many proprietary keys ( " Marx 's , Freud 's , Foucault 's , Derrida 's , or whoever 's , " as he put it ) designed to unlock the infinite number of ironic meanings of a text which could not have been intended by its author . I wonder if this poor sap can realize how much the very wellentrenched cultural phenomenon known as postmodernism , which extends well beyond academia and into popular entertainment , depends on the existing gentleman 's agreement among critics to honor any ironic scrip as legal tender ? Literary scholarship first became a sort of Oklahoma land rush in which a horde of fledgling intellectuals , bent on obtaining tenure against fierce competition , sought to stake out their little ironic territory wherein they alone might be supposed to know what this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least could be made to mean . Now that every blogger on the Internet can take part too , I do n't think we 're going to be giving up the " readings " game , even temporarily , anytime soon . Besides , the " texts " that are subject to ironic reinterpretation now include the documents on which our government is founded . Every judge is now an ironist , seeking new meanings in old documents by which some progressive fad- the latest is gay " marriage " - can be shown to be not only justified but mandatory . President Obama has lately told us that a pack of legal ironists headed by his attorney general are also to be turned loose on the so-called torture memos written by officials of his predecessor 's administration so as to find in them some way for their authors to be prosecuted as criminals . Already , the George W. Bush administration has been the subject of more ironic reinterpretation than any in our history , including that of Terry Jones in Terry Jones 's War on the War on Terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States when you 've got the finely tuned paranoia of Terry Jones's- or Frank Rich 's or Maureen Dowd 's or Eric Holder 's or whoever's- " reading " of him to go by ? Still , you 've got to think that even the po-mo critic must sometimes get weary of such a souldeadening exercise , set up on the premise that nobody but he knows what anybody or anything is really about . That maybe why , in Romeo Castellucci 's recent staging of Dante 's Inferno in London , hell was represented between a pair of outsized quotation marks as the seat of irony , where a Satanic Andy Warhol went about with a Polaroid camera , snapping photos of the damned . It is , as Dominic Cavendish noted in the Daily Telegraph , " a vision of unremediable human loneliness . " Likewise , a staging of Beowulf In New York had the legendary hero , in the shape of the nerdy-looking author , Jason Craig , confronting three academic critics in the place of the monsters of the poem . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I detect in it a further ironic subtext of desire to leave the circle of the ironically clued-up , at least for a moment , in order to breathe a purer air .
