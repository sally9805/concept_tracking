What do you get when you merge a cellphone and a personal organizer ? One pretty smart phone . Photograph QUALCOMM PDQ PRICE $500 to $1,000 SIZE 6.2 by 2.6 by 1.4 inches WEIGHT 10 ounces SCREEN SIZE 1.9 by 2.4 inches // ON A RAINY DAY in New York City , I can be 10 to 15 minutes late to an appointment without feeling too much guilt about not calling ahead . But sitting in a cab that 's crawling along Park Avenue more slowly than I can walk , I finally had to concede I would n't make it to my destination within even my generous lateness guidelines . It was time to make the familiar " I 'm running late " phone call , and check to see if the delay would have a domino effect on my schedule . Ordinarily , that involves yanking two devices from my bag : my cellular phone ( to make the call ) and my personal organizer ( to check my schedule and perhaps get the phone number I need ) . This time , however , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart phone , which combines a wireless phone with an electronic organizer A la 3Com 's Palm or Franklin 's Rex . It 's the next best thing to having a human assistant at your side . Smart phones are n't new , at least in concept . BellSouth merged cellular phone and handheld computer functions in its Simon , an innovative but bulky device that never caught on . Nokia 's 9000 , a phone that opened clamshell-style to reveal a keyboard and screen inside , was a considerably sleeker attempt to combine communication and organization , but it was not received particularly well either  --  at least in the United States-in part because it used the European GSM wireless standard . ( The phone got a warmer reception in Europe and even spawned a second generation , the Nokia 9110 , last year . ) But even without a hit product , the idea makes too much sense simply to pass quietly into the conceptual mist . Now , two of the biggest names in cellular phones , Motorola and Qualcomm , are each taking a stab at wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qualcomm 's pdQ has an organizer built into the phone . Motorola 's StarTac Mobile Organizer piggybacks atop a StarTac phone . At first glance , the pdQ looks a bit like a mobile phone on steroids . And at 10 ounces , it 's about twice as heavy as some of the smaller wireless phones these days . But there 's a lot going on inside . The keypad flips down to reveal a spacious ( for a phone anyway ) LCD screen , with icons that will be familiar to anyone who 's used one of 3Com 's Palm devices . Indeed , that 's what the pdQ is : a **28;2035;TOOLONG phone and a Palm III organizer in a package that , while large by cellphone standards , is quite a bit smaller and lighter than the two products combined . As a CDMA digital phone , the Photograph MOTOROLA STARTAC MOBILE ORGANIZER PRICE $250 SIZE 4.1 by 0.9 inches WEIGHT 2.3 ounces ( under 6 ounces with phone ) SCREEN SIZE 1.3 by 2.2 inches // As a CDMA digital phone , thepdQ has all the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short  --  message service . All phone-related services are accessible via the dial pad . So you can make and receive calls , access your voice mail , and so on without ever digging into the organizer that literally lies beneath the surface . Flipping open the keypad activates the touchscreen and turns on all of the phone 's Palm III capabilities . It can track your expenses , calendar information , addresses , and even phone numbers . The pdQ can also serve as a memo pad ( complete with handwriting recognition ) and a calculator . And , as with other Palm devices , it can synchronize all of this information with your desktop , whether it is a PC or Macintosh . While the screen dimensions are the same as the Palm III 's ( 160 by 240 pixels ) , the working area on the pdQ is smaller , in part because it displays phone-status information ( signal strength , battery level , and roaming status ) at the top . But in virtually every other way , the hardware matches up , including 2MB of memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing or writing . Conveniently , all of the Palm III functions can be accessed with the phone service turned off . ( There 's a phone icon on the side of the display that controls phone power in addition to a power button on the dial pad . ) So you can peruse your contacts or appointments and save battery life when you 're not expecting any calls , and even use the organizer functions on an airplane , where powering on the phone is forbidden . Yet there is some logical integration between its dual personalities . You , can dial a phone number from the address book , for example , and use the phone 's communicating ability to send and receive e-mail ( via your existing Internet account ) . You can even do some limited World Wide Web surfing with sites that support small-screen browsers . The pdQ wo n't fit in your pocket , however , which is where the StarTac Mobile Organizer fits in . This 2.3-ounce device for any StarTac phone clips onto the spot otherwise reserved for an extended-life battery . Clipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 6 ounces . The pairing does double the size of the StarTac alone , but even so it 's still a pretty small package . Rather than opt for the popular Palm organizer , which requires a lot of screen space , Motorola chose to base the Mobile Organizer on the Rex , an organizer that 's only slightly bigger than a credit card yet can synchronize addresses , phone numbers , appointments , to-do lists , and memos with your desktop PC . This is a marriage that was clearly designed for use on the road . When clipped to the StarTac , the Mobile Organizer lets you dial numbers from the address book . But you can also download phone numbers from the organizer into the phone for times when you want to leave the organizer portion behind . And the organizer can stand alone , since it draws power from its own two lithium ion watch batteries . This is especially handy when you 're on the phone and would like to check your schedule . Instead of switching between talking and looking , as you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unclip the Mobile Organizer and operate it with your free hand . You can even customize the device for right- or left-hand use . Some of the ounces that the Mobile Organizer eschews translate into limitations . You can enter information and edit entries on the Mobile Organizer , as you can on the pdQ . But the method for doing so-selecting one letter at a time with arrow buttons-is far too tedious and time-consuming for anything but quick appointment or phone number edits . E-mail , Web browsing , and expense tracking are lacking altogether , and you ca n't add new functions with third-party programs , as you can with the pdQ 's Palm . So in one corner you have the lightweight , the Mobile Or anizer and in the other the heavyweight , the pdQ . But they wo n't be alone in battling for your briefcase . NeoPoint 's 1000 is due later this year , and Ericsson 's 8380 should be available early next year . This round , the cellular phone may have finally met its match .
