I do n't have any misgivings , " Ted Fennig of Greendale , Wisconsin , said last week . Fennig 's son , Technical Sergeant Patrick P. Fennig , 34 , an F-15 crew chief , was killed in the explosion at the Khobar Towers compound . " None of us , " Fennig said , " have a problem with the mission . " The families of other service members who died echoed that sentiment , and U.S. officials insisted that the act of terror would not deter the U.S. from fulfilling its mission in Saudi Arabia and around the Persian Gulf . In the aftermath of last week 's deaths , however , it is appropriate to ask what exactly that mission is and whether the U.S. is carrying it out in the most sensible manner . <P> The specific role of the Air Force in Dhahran is to enforce the no-fly zone imposed on southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War . But more generally , America 's mission in the Persian Gulf is to protect the flow of oil . The gulf states produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is vital to the global economy . As the U.S. sees it , the biggest threats to that stability are Iraq and Iran , two powerful countries with ambitions to someday dominate the region . The U.S. policy of keeping both Iraq and Iran in check is known as dual containment . <P> To pursue that policy in the aftermath of the Gulf War , the U.S. has dramatically increased its presence in the region  --  indeed , the gulf is the only major theater in the world where the American military is expanding . Before the war there were rarely more than 1,000 American troops in Saudi Arabia at any one time and even fewer in any neighboring country . Today there are about 20,000 U.S. troops in the area . About half are afloat in the gulf , while Air Force , Army and Marine personnel operate out of four bases in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia ( there may be as many as four air bases in Saudi Arabia alone , but the U.S. refuses to give the exact number ) . A naval station in Bahrain , headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships , including a carrier deck full of warplanes . Kuwait and Qatar have each agreed to store enough armor , artillery and supplies for an entire brigade of U.S. soldiers ; a similar accord with the United Arab Emirates is in the works . And finally , the U.S. is constructing a " noose " of five air bases around the region that could help stifle any provocations on the part of Iran and Iraq . <P> The dual-containment policy has critics  --  some European countries wonder why the U.S. does not engage Iran and Iraq as it does Syria , whose regime is equally brutal  --  but few would dispute the strategic value of protecting oil . The question , though , is whether the U.S. has become so aggressive in its buildup that it risks undermining the gulf countries even as it protects them . The U.S. tries to maintain a low profile , but as the Dhahran bombing and the one in Riyadh that preceded it both tragically indicate , the presence of U.S. soldiers incites radical Islamists . Many Arabs who are not extremists are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an infidel force occupying Islam 's holy land . U.S. troops further provoke internal agitation because they are seen as props for authoritarian and corrupt regimes .
