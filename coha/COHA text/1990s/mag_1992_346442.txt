" As the ancients used to say , the war is not over as long as the last slain soldier remains unburied . " With these words Russian President Boris Yeltsin made an effort last week to help mend the scars of the cold war . In a letter to the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs , Yeltsin confirmed that in the 1950s the Soviet Union shot down nine U.S. aircraft  --  incidents never made public by the Pentagon  --  and held 12 surviving Americans in prison or psychiatric clinics . He also reported that the Soviets held 716 American servicemen for varying periods during World War II and interrogated 59 American pows from the Korean War . He offered no significant information on the fate of missing servicemen from the Vietnam War era . <P> Senator John Kerry congratulated Yeltsin for " admitting the sins of the past .

Yeltsin promised more details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
