<p> FOR THE STRONGEST SENSE OF Rembrandt as a living , thinking artist , nothing quite beats his etchings . And when it comes to seeing Rembrandt etchings in the United States , nothing at all beats the Pierpont Morgan Library , which has the largest collection in North America . For the first time in nearly 25 years , the Morgan has put a good chunk of its holdings on view through Jan. 5 in " A Fine Line : Rembrandt as Etcher . " <p> This is a wonderful show : illuminating , pleasurable , often quite moving . It shows an artist of genius coming to grips with a relatively new medium  --  etching being less than a century old when Rembrandt took it up  --  and expanding its possibilities as his expressive needs grew . <p> Rembrandt made his first etchings around 1626 , when he was barely 20 . His brilliant draftsman skills suited the medium superbly , and until the late 1650 's he devoted as much time to printmaking as to drawing and painting  --  the first great painter to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unprecedented play of light against dark or , in some astoundingly velvety cases , dark against dark . He also gained a new subtlety of surface and psychological portrayal by working directly on the copper plate with dry point ( a fine needle ) and burin ( a pointed cutting tool ) , refining the etched image , which is made by drawing into a resinous ground that coats the copper plate so that the exposed areas can be etched by acid . Some of his later prints were made with dry point and burin alone . <p> This exhibition 's 83 prints touch on all Rembrandt 's major themes and subjects  --  the penetrating portraits and self-portraits , the alternately homey and magisterial scenes from the Bible , the unidealized renderings of nudes ( female and male ) and the increasingly unfettered treatments of the Dutch landscape , as well as genre scenes and his single etched still life , a magnificently isolated little seashell . The result is a succinct encapsulation of Rembrandt 's development , in which the initial pull of the Baroque was transformed by sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close scrutiny of the actual world and , above all , an increasing emphasis on the materials and processes of art making . <p> Rembrandt was arguably the first artist to make this process a central part of his art 's content ; this is one reason his work always feels so familiarly modern . His paintings never let us forget , sometimes to the point of murkiness , that they are paint applied to canvas . They exude a sense of touch and emotional striving . <p> His etchings reveal this process just as much and often with greater clarity . First of all , they can have a crystalline , almost transparent quality . We do n't just look at Rembrandt etchings ; we often have the sensation of looking through them , of seeing how they have been built , mark by mark , from the inside out . In addition , since the etching plate can be printed and then reworked , prints can exist in different " states " that trace an artist 's decisions and revisions , providing a series of interim reports . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Etchings at the Morgan labeled " only state , " include extremes like the nocturnal " Presentation in the Temple in the Dark Manner " and the evanescent " Christ Appearing Before the Apostles , " in which the Saviour 's radiance seems almost to fracture the image . But he also reworked plates extensively or returned to them when his concept of an image had changed . <p> Cara Dufour Denison , curator of drawings and prints at the Morgan and the exhibition 's organizer , has emphasized this tendency by representing nearly 20 prints with two to four different states each . Other prints are represented by two impressions of the same state , revealing how subtle changes in the inking of the plate or a different kind of paper can alter the visual outcome and reflecting Rembrandt 's interest in experimentation . <p> THE SHOW INCLUDES , FOR example , two impressions of the only state of Rembrandt 's famous print " Christ Preaching : La Petite Tombe " on contrasting papers . On the soft , creamy Japanese sheet the image is gently blurred ; shadows seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This could almost be an ink drawing . On lighter , less absorbent European paper , the same image has an altogether different sense of tone and form : the lines are crisp , the image shot through with sparkling light , and Christ has lost some of his supernatural aura . <p> Also here are two contrasting states ( Nos. 1 and 7 of 8 ) of the monumental 1655 print " Christ Presented to the People , " which was rendered entirely with dry point . Between them , they show that Rembrandt rethought both the image 's internal scale and its emotional mood . Gone from the second image are a row of figures standing before the sunlit platform on which Christ appears , and the platform itself has been punctured by two black grottolike openings that suggest a dark , pantheistic underworld . Gone also is nearly an inch from the the top of the image , a change that thrusts the whole architectural setting forward , increasing its massiveness . <p> The Morgan show is full of similarly telling progressions of images , some grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versions of various prints . All point to increasing maturity , a clearer grasp of the human condition and an ever more declarative use of the print medium . <p> It begins with small self-portraits made in the first flush of technical mastery . They show the artist grimacing and frowning , as if mugging for the camera . Their young-man-in-a-hurry exuberance is balanced by ineffably tender images of the artist 's ancient mother , from the same period . <p> These are succeeded by two larger , more assured self-portraits that depict the artist as successful young Turk . Especially in the dandyish " Rembrandt With Turned-Up Hat and Embroidered Mantle " of 1631 , the artist unleashes a virtuosic display of textures , carefully differentiating the fur , lace and brocade of his lavish garments from the luminous fluff of his hair . <p> Nearby , " Self-Portrait Drawing at a Window , " from 1648 , seen in two states , strikes an entirely different note . Rembrandt is older and wiser , having lost his beloved young wife , Saskia , and acquired mounting debts . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigorous grid of crosshatching defines the shadowy precincts of a dark interior flanked by a bright window . Next to it , merging with the shadows yet illuminated by the light , sits the artist , who is wearing work clothes and looking up from his task with resolute determination . The image provides a glimpse of the will and concentration that generated everything else on the Morgan 's walls . <p> A similar progression operates among the portraits . The eye is initially caught by the four handsome states of " Clement de Jonghe , Printseller , " an image from 1651 that Rembrandt fine tunes without bringing the sitter any closer to us . In contrast , a rich psychological availability characterizes several beautifully wrought portraits from the late 1650 's : the surgeon Arnold Tholinx , who fixes us with an interested , appraising air ; Old Haaringh , a city official , whose wrinkled face communicates a beleaguered fragility , and " Jan Lutma , Goldsmith , " a grandfatherly figure whose downturned gaze is quietly imperious . <p> The give-and-take between process and image is played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the homey little " Abraham Talking to Isaac , " the figures are fully defined while the landscape is an open sketch , wonderfully transparent . In " The Three Trees , " Rembrandt 's most ambitious landscape print , there 's more tension . The towering , rather tightly rendered trees are strikingly at odds with the loose linear evocations of cloud and wind that give the sky a life and a scale of its own . In other landscapes , Rembrandt used a similar economy of means to intimate entire vistas , as in " Jan Six 's Bridge " and " The Goldweigher 's Field . " <p> Sometimes process and image seem almost in conflict . The exhibition 's indisputable highlight is " The Three Crosses , " the monumental image of Golgotha that Rembrandt produced in 1655 and returned to again as late as 1661 . The Morgan owns the first , second and fourth of four states , which trace a sense of deepening human tragedy and an increasingly passionate manipulation of the plate . In the first and second versions , a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good thief and the huddled masses of Mary and the other faithful to the right of the Cross . <p> In the fourth , Rembrandt 's entire conception has changed . The composition has been clarified and strengthened . The attending crowd has been thinned , so that the crucified figures are now echoed by three prominent witnesses : a man on horseback depicted in profile wearing a bulbous , unctuously official hat ( taken from a medallion by Pisanello , it also evokes " Alice in Wonderland " ) ; a soldier with a raised sword and the grieving St. John , whose arms are now extended up and out , as if crucified himself . <p> But opposing this new clarity of composition are long , repeating diagonals that Rembrandt also added . These rain down from above , like some graphic form of heavenly wrath , adding to grief a sense of impending doom . These lines are especially heavy on the right , where the good thief is now all but obliterated . They form a dark curtain that is about to be drawn across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process that brought it into being .
