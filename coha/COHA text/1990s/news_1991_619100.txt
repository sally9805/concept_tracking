<p> President Bush thinks the recession ended last summer , but Bay Area executives strongly disagree . A near-unanimous 96 percent of those responding to a new Chronicle poll said the Bay Area remains stuck in a recession . <p> Most of the local executives said the Bay Area 's economic recovery would not begin until the third quarter of next year at the earliest . <p> " We are definitely in a recession and I 'd say we 're maybe nine months or a year away from the upturn based on what I see from our business and that of our clients , " said Lynn Odland , Northern California managing partner for the accounting firm of Deloitte &; Touche . " Even then it will go pretty slowly and take a year or more to get back to a full , strong economy . " <p> Asked to specify precisely when the Bay Area 's economic recovery would begin , 23 percent cited the first or second quarter of 1992 , 46 percent said the third or fourth quarter of 1992 and a very pessimistic 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It does not appear there is going to be a short duration to this . Based on our own bookings , I do n't see a pullout from recession in the next six months , " said Kent Mitchell , general manager of the Hotel Sofitel in Redwood City and president-elect of the Redwood City- San Mateo County Chamber of Commerce . <p> Only 9 percent of the 577 executives polled rated current Bay Area business conditions as above average , down sharply from 45 percent in last year 's poll , 71 percent in 1989 and 79 percent in the bullish year of 1988 . <p> Not a single executive said current business conditions were excellent this year , while 32 percent rated conditions as poor  --  up sharply from just 5 percent last year . <p> " We have hit a new low in perceptions of the economy , " said Mark Baldassare , whose Irvine ( Orange County ) firm does the poll for The Chronicle . <p> Yet the fifth annual Chronicle Business Outlook Poll offered some reasons to be optimistic about next year . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectations about the future of the Bay Area economy increased in this year 's survey . Thirty-eight percent of executives throughout the Bay Area said they thought the local economy would expand in 1992 , compared to 30 percent last year . <p> Executives in the North and East Bay tended to be even more optimistic , as 44 percent said the local economy would expand next year . San Francisco executives were not nearly as upbeat , however , with only 32 percent of the respondents from the city predicting expansion . <p> Another glimmer of hope appeared when the executives were asked to comment about their own companies rather than the region as a whole . For the first time in five years there was an increase in the number of executives who said they expected their own company 's financial position to be better a year from now . <p> Additionally , fewer executives expect their profits to decline next year , fewer executives are planning to reduce their workforce and fewer are planning to cut salaries . <p> Of course , Bay Area executives do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the economy . For instance , in last year 's poll 46 percent of the respondents said the Bay Area was not in a recession . Government statistics later indicated that the economic downturn began nearly six months before the executives were polled . <p> " I think they just were not willing to admit to recession last year . They thought things would improve and that California might avoid the recession that was hitting the rest of the country , " pollster Baldassare said . " But this year they are realists about the conditions they face . And most executives are looking beyond the cloudy skies to improving conditions six or seven months from now . " <p> Certainly , 1991 has been a difficult year for most Bay Area businesses . Only 29 percent of the executives said their own company 's overall financial position was better today than a year ago . This was the fifth consecutive decline in the number of executives saying things were better than the year before . <p> Fifty percent said things were the same as a year ago , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was up from 16 percent last year and just 7 percent in 1988 . <p> " Compared to a year ago , our position is definitely down . If we can break even , that will be a victory , " said Michael Spencer , president of Stat Nursing Services in Novato . " But I think things will improve in 1992 and we 're planning to expand . " <p> That cautiously upbeat outlook for 1992 abounds among the executives polled , as 46 percent said they thought their company 's financial position would be better a year from today . That marks the first increase in five years . <p> Only 3 percent thought their company would be in worse shape a year from now , down from 5 percent last year . About half the executives thought things would be about the same next year . <p> Asked about their plans for the coming year , the respondents said profits and employee salaries would increase about 5 percent on average , while capital spending would climb about 2 percent . All three median projections for 1992 are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's poll . <p> Only 16 percent of the executives said profits would fall , down from a 22 percent response last year . On the other end of the scale , 29 percent said profits would be up 11 percent or more in 1992  --  the largest number in four years predicting such a big profit jump . <p> While 31 percent of the companies said they may reduce the number of their employees next year , that represents a decrease from 35 percent a year ago . On the other hand , 25 percent of the companies plan to increase staffing by 6 percent or more , up from 20 percent in last year 's poll . When it comes to salaries , 90 percent of respondents said they would increase this year , about the same number as a year ago . <p> Almost a third , or 31 percent , of the companies plan to expand their Bay Area operations in coming years . That was down only slightly from the 35 percent response last year . <p> The most likely companies to expand were those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 500 employees and companies in the service or retail industries . The companies least likely to expand were those in San Francisco , those with fewer than 200 employees and those in the financial services , insurance or real-estate industries . <p> CHART : <p> THE BAY AREA OUTLOOK .
