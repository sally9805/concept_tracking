TRIAL BY LEAKS <P> " So far , we have gossip , innuendo and leaks . Enough already ! We are fortunate to have a President who is sensitive and compassionate . " BRETT LEVIN PINTO Quogue , N.Y . <P> I hold the office of President in the highest regard , but not the man SPECIAL REPORT , Feb. 16 . President Clinton and his cohort need to come clean and stop blaming everyone else for their troubles . I commend independent counsel Kenneth Starr for his perseverance in the face of denial . Starr did n't bring the thunder down from the heavens onto the Clintons ; they did it themselves . I am ashamed that Clinton is still in office . TARYN SANFORD Sheffield , Ala . <P> Just imagine how the history of the past 35 years might have been changed if , during the Cuban missile crisis , President John F. Kennedy had had to face not only Nikita Khrushchev but also a special prosecutor digging into his sex life . I am concerned that today the U.S. is focused on Clinton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City <P> Do Americans want the media to have a camera and microphone placed between the sheets of all elected officials in order to monitor every single moment of their lives ? This attitude debases democracy and shames America . MARK GREENTON Cleveland , Ohio <P> Starr is seeking to build a case involving perjury , subornation of perjury and obstruction of justice . He is not seeking to indict the President for adultery or sexual misconduct . Yet the media and the public seem unable to understand this . What is so complicated ? HENRY S. KRAMER Wharton , N.J. <P> Special Prosecutor Starr is portrayed as a witch hunter by the media . But his investigation has led to indictments and convictions . More will come despite consistent stonewalling . The independent-counsel law is badly written , but it was passed by a Democratic Congress and extended by a Democratic Congress . It is now being used for " witch-hunts " against Democrats . How tragic . DAVID M. HERRING Rockport , Texas <P> Back in the 1920s , Cecil B. Demille made movies featuring wild pagan bacchanals with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , he explained , because he was only telling stories from the Bible . For titillating his audience while piously claiming a higher motive , ole Cecil B. had nothing on Starr . LARRY RAINER Burlington , Vt . <P> The lurid drama of the White House sex scandal is an American tragedy . The Justices of the Supreme Court raised the curtain when , with questionable judicial wisdom , they decreed in the Paula Jones case that a President can be sued while he is in office . HENRY LEE Memphis , Tenn . <P> AND THE PRESS GOES WILD <P> While I respect the media 's right to pursue a news story , I must say that watching the frenzy when Clinton 's secretary was called before the grand jury deeply saddened me SPECIAL REPORT , Feb. 16 . Have we forgotten so quickly what happened to Princess Diana ? Is n't the mainstream press guilty of doing what it is so critical of ? JOSEPH MCGRATH Stratford , Conn . <P> You are publishing simply too much on Clinton 's troubles . As if the President 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important problems in the world ! If I were interested in tawdry scandals , I 'd read the tabloids . RENATE FREYMANN Hochstadt , Germany
