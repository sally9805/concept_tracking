<p> Yoichi Otsuki seemed to be enjoying a life of power and prestige , until he fastened a noose to a curtain rod in his apartment and looped it around his neck . <p> A longtime official at the Finance Ministry , Mr. Otsuki , 54 , was ensconced in an influential job in the ministry 's castle-like bastion near the Imperial Palace . Behind these walls , in the " House of the Great Coffers , " as it is known in Japan , Mr. Otsuki worked in the nation 's nerve center , the most powerful organization in Japan . <p> The ministry 's tentacles touch so many facets of political and economic life that its officials wield power without parallel in the West . It has traditionally been more influential than the Prime Minister or any political party , and because it steers the world 's second-biggest economy , the Finance Ministry 's smallest maneuvers can move financial markets around the globe . <p> So it has been an extraordinary comedown since late January , when prosecutors first breached the Finance Ministry 's seemingly impregnable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials , including two of Mr. Otsuki 's subordinates , for accepting bribes from the financial institutions they oversee . When prosecutors moved in on Mr. Otsuki , however , he could not stand the humiliation . Just before he was to be interrogated by police at 1:30 P.M. on Jan. 27 , Mr. Otsuki went home and hanged himself . <p> The scandal in which he found himself enmeshed is still unfolding , with critics pointing fingers at prominent officials day after day . Just last Wednesday , prosecutors entered the central bank , traditionally a dominion of the ministry , to seize a high-level official . Private bankers have been detained as well , top executives have resigned at major financial institutions and one Parliament member , another finance ministry official and numerous businessmen have committed suicide to escape disgrace . <p> The scandal is shattering Japan 's old faith in public servants and suggesting to a growing number of Japanese cynics that their bureaucracy may be rotten to the core . With economic troubles dogging all of Asia , the Finance Ministry is the single institution most able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly resembles a fortress under siege , attacked both at home and abroad for errant behavior and policy mismanagement . <p> Critics worry that the ministry may have lost its way at a moment when leaders in the United States and other industrial nations are demanding that it take more steps to help prevent an Asian tailspin . Economists say that by trying to tighten the country 's belt even during hard times , the ministry risks throwing Japan into recession . <p> Japan 's politicians , accustomed to staying on the sidelines in formulation of economic policy , are now stepping in to take the lead , further threatening the ministry and preventing its experts from fully concentrating on the task of nursing the sick economy . Particularly on the eve of a broad restructuring of the financial industry , the ministry appears distracted by its scandals and by turf battles with politicians  --  battles that it may be beginning to lose . <p> " There will be a very drastic shift of power from the bureaucrats to the politicians , " said Koichi Kato , secretary general of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bureaucrats who were thought to be the best and the brightest in this society , handling all policies , were proved to be not as effective and competent as we had thought . Now it is time for us politicians to make our own policy . " <p> " This is a very dangerous time for us , " Mr. Kato said . <p> A real devolution of power , if it occurs , will have major policy implications for Japan and the world . Just last week , for instance , executives in the governing party indicated they would devise a spending package of more than $80 billion to stimulate the economy . <p> For now , the Finance Ministry has fended off a formal attempt by Sakigake , a small party in the governing coalition , to break it up into a handful of agencies . Until recently , the ministry was seen as the bedrock of Japanese prosperity , so few balked at the extent of its power  --  roughly equivalent to a combination of the United States Treasury Department , the Internal Revenue Service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exchange Commission and parts of the Federal Reserve . <p> Amid recent calls by politicians to curb its powers , however , the ministry has agreed to spin off a financial surveillance agency in June . Both the Finance Minister and the Vice Finance Minister were forced out of their positions earlier this year as casualties of the widening assault on the ministry . <p> But while the ministry 's power appears on the wane for now , its strength and expertise , which make it arguably the most important repository of power outside of Washington , continue to dwarf that of Japan 's elected officials . Politicians have called for more spending , but attempts to alter the ministry 's steadfast policy of fiscal austerity have bounced off the ministry 's stone walls . <p> Still , the attack on the ministry has been debilitating . Japan 's weekly magazines are accusing it of everything from dishonesty to ineptitude . And the public is learning that Finance Ministry officials do not always spend their time laboring in neckties over statistical charts but also have been known to cavort  --  sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  at the raunchiest of sex clubs . <p> " They are losing control , " Toru Nakakita , an economics professor at Toyo University , said of the ministry 's bureaucrats . " They are demoralized . They are a group of very proud people , but they made an awful lot of fallacies . They 've blundered so many times . " <p> The crisis in the ministry is particularly inopportune because it is supposed to be busy overseeing a " Big Bang " deregulation of the financial markets that aims to make Tokyo a financial center as dynamic and free as New York or London . <p> Critics point out that the ministry has a checkered record on managing free markets . Economists and politicians blame the ministry for inflating Japan 's " bubble " economy during the 1980 's , bursting it in the early 1990 's and then allowing the economy to stagnate for the last seven years . <p> At stake for Finance Ministry bureaucrats  --  predominantly graduates of the country 's top university who are for the most part brilliant , dedicated , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of the Japanese universe . It is unclear what would replace the ministry and how it might usher in changes that would diminish its own powers , enabling the economy to function more freely and openly . <p> " We 're at a crossroads , and the catchword today is transparency , " said Kiichi Miyazawa , a former bureaucrat who has served as both Prime Minister and Finance Minister . " This transparency really means sometimes a very , very brutal confrontation , which is not really a part of our culture . But it matters in economics , in legal matters as well . Transparency is the must . That should mean that the discretionary power of the bureaucrats should be reduced . " <p> For years , the ministry had a say in virtually every move a financial institution made , from opening a new branch or closing a subsidiary to introducing a new product to inspecting the giveaways offered in marketing campaigns . One bank told a Japanese newspaper that it felt it had to consult the ministry on the size of dividends a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt obliged to confer on the kind of calendars they could offer to customers and the kind of uniforms their female clerical workers could wear . <p> Ministry officials dispute that , saying that banks setting up new branches would face almost no obstacles as long as they submitted the proper documents with their application . As for picayune issues like uniforms and calendars , one official snorted , though he refused to be named , as did other ministry officials interviewed for this article . <p> " That 's quite unthinkable , " he said , adding , " Those stories are quite exaggerated , in my personal opinion . " <p> Ministry officials say they have been on the defensive for some time . " We have been losing power for the last several years , " said Sei Nakai , deputy director of the ministry 's prestigious banking bureau . " That is why we are being attacked . " <p> " From the outside , it sometimes seems that the Ministry of Finance decides everything , but it 's wrong . " he added . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministry is accused not just of economic ineptitude but , perhaps more important in the public mind , of corruption and misbehavior . While lavish entertainment of government officials by corporate executives has long been commonplace in Japan , the public has been particularly angered by the revelation that banks entertained Finance Ministry officials at " no-pan shabu-shabu " clubs . <p> Shabu-shabu is a kind of cooked meat , but the specialty of the restaurant is the waitresses , who wear short skirts and no underwear : In Japanese , " no-pan " refers to " no panties . " So " no-pan shabu-shabu " has become a national joke . The idea of these officials discussing bank regulation in such a setting is so absurd that it is becoming difficult for the ministry to be taken seriously . <p> Traditionally , ministry bureaucrats had been viewed almost universally as honest and extraordinarily hard-working  --  choosing a life of Government service over far more lucrative options in the private sector . <p> " Somehow it became a fashion of the day to criticize the bureaucrats , " said Kaoru Yosano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This is a very safe way for politicians . " <p> Often it is the ministry that ends up taking the blame because no one else wants to take responsibility , Mr. Yosano and others say . For instance , when Japanese bankers met with their counterparts from other countries to discuss South Korea 's debt crisis , the banks apparently did not want to make a decision without consulting the Finance Ministry , according to Mr. Nakai of the ministry . <p> Ministry officials read this as a sign that the banks did not want to take the blame if the loans went sour , so they turned to the ministry for guidance and security . <p> Many say the ministry can not ignore the blunder it made a year ago when it declared that the economy was recovering and insisted on increasing a national sales tax last April . The tax increase sent the Japanese economy tumbling over a cliff , plunging at an annual rate of 11 percent in the second quarter of 1997 . <p> Ministry officials now admit they underestimated the impact of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply rising fiscal deficit and national debt that is rising faster than that of other advanced countries . So despite American pressure , the officials are determined to proceed with what they call fiscal reconstruction , meaning austerity , to put Japan 's budget in order . <p> The ministry 's budget bureau regards this goal as sacred , according to a high-level ministry official who is not in the budget bureau . <p> With only a touch of levity , he said , " It 's a kind of religious sect.
