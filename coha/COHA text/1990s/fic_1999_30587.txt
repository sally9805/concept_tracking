Chapter OneSpringwater , Montana Territory , Fall of 1882 The distant hills were skirted in every shade of crimson , yellow , and brown , the sky a blue so deep that it caused something to twist softly in the depths of Olivia Wilcott Darling 's spinsterly heart , the air crisp with the promise of an early frost , perhaps even of snow . Olivia , busy throughout that October morning burning dry branches pruned a month earlier from the trees , shrubs , and lilac bushes growing in her yard , stopped to touch the back of one hand to her brow . The acrid , autumny scent of woodsmoke roused within her an odd but familiar feeling of sorrowful festivity . Though she mourned the summer , vibrant early on with peonies and lilacs and sleepy bees , and then later with roses , the fall was still her favorite time of year . She loved its vivid colors and strange , chilly promise and , at moments like this one , with the fragrant fire crackling cheerfully nearby , with her fine , spotless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand , she felt expectant , as if something were about to happen . Something out of the ordinary , something wonderful . A friendly female voice interrupted her revery . " Olivia ? Are n't you planning to join us at Rachel 's for the quilting bee ? " She managed a smile for Savannah Parrish , who lived with her husband and several children across the road , then approached the neatly painted fence . She 'd hired young Toby McCaffrey to whitewash the pickets in the spring , and he 'd done a fine job . Savannah , a lovely woman with hair the color of copper and eyes that shone with happiness , was married to the town 's only physician . She 'd told Olivia herself , right off , that she 'd once been a saloon owner and singer , news that had amazed Olivia at the time , since those were not things most women would have admitted to a close friend , let alone a mere acquaintance . Now , clad in a gray cloak and a practical , lightweight woolen dress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olivia , her basket of sewing supplies over one arm , and waited expectantly for a reply . Olivia shook her head , looked away for a moment , looked back . The women of Springwater could n't be accused of shunning her  --  she was invited to every tea party , every church social , every quilting bee . Once or twice , she had actually attended , but she had felt so painfully out of place in the swirling midst of all that joyous chatter that it seemed easier just to stay away . " We 'll be finishing up Cornucopia 's quilt today , " Savannah prompted , smiling . " Who would have thought that trail boss would just ride into town one day , buy a pouch of tobacco from her over at the general store , and ask her to marry him , just like that ? " Olivia 's effort at a responding smile simply would n't stick to her mouth . At thirty-two , she had long since given up on marriage and a family of her own  --  she 'd been passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had so often reminded her  --  but that did n't mean she did n't still pine sometimes . While she liked Cornucopia just fine  --  indeed , she liked them all , Mrs. McCaffrey , Mrs. Wainwright , Mrs. Hargreaves , Mrs. Kildare , Mrs. Calloway and , of course , Savannah and all the others  --  secretly , she 'd been bruised by the tidings of the store mistress 's good fortune . It only served to reinforce what Aunt Eloise had always said : she , Olivia , was too tall , too plain , too thin , too smart , and far too contentious to attract a good man . She might just as well accept the fact and move on . The trouble was , it was n't always such an easy thing to do . " I 've  --  I 've got to tend this fire , " Olivia said , finding her tongue at last . " I 'm all sooty and my clothes smell of smoke  --  doubtless my hair does , as well . By the time I finished making myself presentable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bow . " Savannah shook her head , but her expression remained kindly . " Nonsense , " she said . " Everyone will be disappointed if you 're not there . " Olivia glanced back at the fire , already settling down to embers , then met Savannah 's gaze straight on . " I 'm sorry . I 'm just  --  too busy . " Savannah looked at her in silence for a long moment , then nodded and gave a small sigh . " Maybe next time , " she said . " Maybe , " Olivia replied . She would have another excuse at the ready when another social occasion arose , and Savannah plainly knew that . She hesitated briefly , nodded once more , and hastened away toward the home of Rachel and Trey Hargreaves . Olivia watched until the other woman had disappeared around the corner of the Springwater stagecoach station , and felt even lonelier than usual . Springwater . He reined in the strawberry roan and leaned forward to rest an arm on the saddle horn , surveying the valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of an ocean of grass , bustling with enterprise despite the first purple shadows of twilight creeping across the landscape . A long sigh escaped him . He ought to rein that roan around and ride off for parts unknown . Put the whole matter behind him , once and for all . On the other hand , he 'd be thirty-seven years old , come the spring , and he 'd been living under an assumed name for so long that he had to think twice sometimes to recall who he really was . Damn , but he was tired of running . Tired of telling lies , tired of waking up in the middle of the night , drenched in sweat , with his guts wrung into a ropy knot and his heart thundering fit to crash right through his rib cage . He 'd go right on calling himself Jack McLaughlin for the time being , he reckoned ; no sense in shocking folks right off . They 'd be getting on in years now , the people he 'd come to see , and one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd keep a careful distance , take things slow . Once he 'd reasoned out what was what , he 'd either tip his hand or get back on that roan and take to the road again . He did n't much cotton to the latter prospect , yearning the way he did for a roof over his head , regular woman-cooked meals , and real beds with clean sheets on them , but if he 'd learned one thing in his life , it was that only fools expected an easy path . He waited another few moments , watching smoke curl , blue-gray , from the chimneys of that little town , then pressed his heels lightly against the roan 's sides and loosened his hold on the reins . As though anxious for gentle company himself , the gelding obeyed instantly . * * * It was nearly dark when he showed up at her front door , that hulking , shaggy stranger , hat in hand , blue eyes meeting her questioning gaze straight on . " They told me over at the Brimstone that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back straightened slightly . Most travelers slept at the Springwater Station , where they could indulge in June-bug McCaffrey 's legendary cooking , if they were the sort to seek indoor sleeping quarters . Therefore , the request caught her slightly off guard . " Yes , " she answered , but primly . She could n't afford to be too cool , though ; after all , she 'd spent Aunt Eloise 's entire bequest buying this house , she was down to her last few dollars , and she needed paying guests . In truth , she had n't had any guests at all , paying or otherwise , as of yet . Still , she made no effort to open the screened door between them . His mouth tilted upward at one side , in a semblance of a quizzical grin , and Olivia was thunderstruck by his resemblance to  --  to someone . She could n't for the life of her think whom it was he looked like , but she relaxed a little all the same , if for no other reason than that sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ma'am , " he said , and started to turn away . He was tall and powerfully built , especially through the shoulders , and his clothes , dungarees , a colorless woolen shirt , battered buckskin chaps , and a long gunslinger 's coat , had all seen better days , as had his boots . " Wait , " Olivia said , and bit her lip . He stopped , turned back . " I charge two dollars a week , without meals , " she told him , well aware that she was falling over her own tongue and there was n't a thing she could do about it . " Four if you want breakfast and supper . I do laundry , too , but I charge by the piece for that . " She paused , cleared her throat . " You 'll have to pay in advance . The two dollars , I mean . " He might have chuckled ; the sound was so low , she could n't be sure . " Fair enough , " he said . He 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held it loosely in the fingers of his right hand . " Name 's Jack McLaughlin , if that 's important . " Praying she would not be murdered in her bed  --  or worse  --  Olivia unlatched the hook and opened the screened door . " It is . Come inside , Mr. McLaughlin , " she said . " I 'll show you your room , and put on some supper , if you 're hungry . " " Do you have one ? " he asked , standing there in the foyer , taller than the long-case clock ticking against the wall . Olivia hesitated , hoping her voice was n't trembling , the way the pit of her stomach was . She had the most peculiar sensation of dizzy exhilaration , as though she 'd just stepped over a precipice in the dark , trusting that she would survive the fall . " A room ? " she asked . He smiled . " A name , " he prompted . She raised her chin . " Miss Olivia Wilcott Darling , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address me . " She had never wanted to barber a man in her life , would n't even have thought of such an intimate thing , but just looking at Mr. McLaughlin brought up a fierce desire to take her sewing shears to all that light brown hair , that dreadful beard that hid so much of his face . " ' Miss Darling ' it is , then , " he responded , with ease , still holding his hat . Olivia took up her skirts , just high enough to keep from getting her feet tangled in the hems , and started up the broad center stairway . She did not dare look back at Mr. McLaughlin , for fear he 'd have sprouted horns and a pointed tail while her back was turned . What , she wondered , had possessed her to buy this house , sight unseen , from an advertisement in a newspaper , using up practically every penny she had , and travel to this remote and rustic community , where she had known not a single soul ? It had been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole of her dull and sheltered life , lighting out for the wild west barely a week after Aunt Eloise had been buried in the family plot back in Simonsonburg , Ohio . What had made her think she was suited to the demands of running a rooming house ? Why , given her reputation for being unsociable , she might lie dead in this house for a considerable length of time before anyone missed her ... " I may not look it , ma'am , " Mr. McLaughlin said , from a pace behind her as they mounted the stairs , " but I 'm a gentleman . Never laid a hand on a woman  --  not against her wishes , anyway  --  in my life . " He 'd read her mind . Olivia did not dare allow him to see her face , which was surely flaming with color , so hot did it feel . " I am not afraid of you or any other man , " she said , falling back , in her desperation , on bravado . " Besides , I keep a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to use it . " An eloquent and perhaps slightly amused silence followed , and Olivia had ample time to regret mentioning her bed , let alone the little pistol she had purchased upon her arrival and never once fired . Gratefully , she reached the door of the best of her three guest chambers , turned the knob , and stepped aside . Mr. McLaughlin passed her , lingering there in the hallway , and stepped over the threshold . The room was dark , and Olivia was forced to go in and light the lamp on the table just to her left , revealing the plain iron bedstead and its coverlet , one of the many she had crocheted during Aunt Eloise 's declining years . There was a bureau , too , and a small washstand , but little else . " This 'll do just fine , " Mr. McLaughlin announced . He shed his coat , and Olivia , frankly disturbed by the simple but innate masculinity of the gesture , felt her breath quicken and her face color up again . His presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very walls , and she would have sworn he was using up more than his fair portion of the air . She remained near the door , one hand on the knob . " I 'll bring up some water , so you can wash before supper . " He was standing with his hands on his hips , and Olivia noticed for the first time that he was armed . He carried the pistol  --  a .44 , she suspected  --  in a shoulder holster , just under his left armpit and within easy reach of his right hand . " There are a few rules , " she said , raising her chin a notch . Mr. McLaughlin thrust a hand through his hair . " I reckoned there would be , " he replied , with a smile in his voice . He removed the pistol  --  he noted she 'd been staring at it  --  and laid it aside on the bureau top , though he did n't bother to unbuckle the holster . " No smoking , I 'll wager . No drinking , either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort in particular . Anything else ? " Although he had spoken in a polite , even friendly fashion , Mr. McLaughlin 's words made Olivia feel like a fussy old maid , and she was irritated , though she could not have said whether with herself or with him . " No swearing , " she added . " No spitting , and no animals of any kind . " He very nearly laughed out loud ; she could see that he wanted to , and she turned and fled like a coward , scurrying along the back corridor and down the narrow rear stairway leading to the kitchen . There , she immediately set herself to the tasks of heating the promised wash water and planning supper , but staying busy did n't help the way it usually did . Her thoughts trailed behind , lingering upstairs , with Mr. McLaughlin . She heard his boot heels echo on the hard wood floor as he crossed the room , probably to the window , and marveled at the effect he had on her . Like most men traveling alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a past ; no doubt he was dangerous , too , though in an entirely different way than an outlaw or a drunk or any other sort of rascal would have been . He had n't done anything wrong , had treated her cordially and with quiet respect from the very first , and yet  --  and yet , she was troubled . He 'd had an instant and profound effect on her , one she did n't begin to comprehend , and her virtue , always firm around her like a corset pulled to the point of bursting its laces , suddenly seemed slightly , well , loose . " Preposterous , " she murmured , and banged down the lid on the hot water reservoir , at one side of the stove . " Beg your pardon , ma'am ? " She nearly started out of her skin ; had the man removed his boots and sneaked down the stairs in his stockinged feet ? She whirled , the blue spatterware ladle in one hand . He grinned in a way that could only have been described as boyish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . " Sorry if I scared you , " he said . " I figured on sparing you a trip up the stairs with that hot water , that 's all . " She stared at him mutely for a few moments , wondering why just looking at him , just hearing the timbre of his voice , should quicken her heartbeat the way it did , and cause her breath to come with ever-so-slightly more effort . " You 'll  --  you 'll be wanting supper ? " He nodded . " Please , " he said . Then , after reaching into a pocket of his dungarees  --  he 'd removed the buckskin chaps  --  he drew out a gleaming twenty-dollar gold piece and laid it on the table . " I 'll be here a month or two , I reckon . " It was all Olivia could do not to bolt over to the table and snatch up that substantial coin before he changed his mind , decided he 'd stay at the Springwater Station after all , and took back his rent money . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he took it and the ladle and began drawing steaming water out of the reservoir . He smelled of horse and man and fresh October air , and of something else that was quite indefinable , and Olivia was profoundly aware of the heat and power of his body , even though they were n't touching . " Do you have a trade , Mr. McLaughlin ? " she asked , because if she had n't said something , she would have bolted like a shy bride confronted with a naked husband . His eyes twinkled when he looked at her , his large , callused hands still busy with the bucket and ladle . " Well , ma'am , I 've done a lot of different sorts of work in my time . Helped build a railroad or two . Did some blacksmithing once or twice  --  I 'm a fair hand with a hammer and saw , too . And like just about every other man west of the wide Missouri , I 've herded my share of cattle . " He paused . " You ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she did not quite know how to breathe . Not for the first time , she wished she were closer to Savannah Parrish and Rachel Hargreaves and the others . It would have been a comfort to have someone , a married woman with a working knowledge of such phenomena , to ask about the strange impact this man had upon her nerves and senses . " Have I herded cattle ? " she stalled . He laughed , replaced the chrome lid on the reservoir , steam from the bucket of hot water a mist floating between them . " I guess I was asking how you came to be way out here in Springwater , all by yourself , running a rooming house . " " How do you know I 'm alone ? " Olivia demanded . " That 's pretty obvious , given the fact that you 're scared to death of me , but willing to have me under your roof and at your table , all the same . Besides , you introduced yourself as ' Miss ' Darling , remember ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that was the odd thing . Wanted him to understand that she 'd had fine dreams once , and high hopes , just like every other woman , explain how she 'd been orphaned at fifteen and subsequently spent her best years looking after a crotchety aunt . But it simply would n't do , spilling out such personal details . " Your question is a bit too familiar , Mr. McLaughlin , " she said . He grinned , shrugged those massive shoulders , and turned away to head up the stairway again . Why did he seem so very familiar when he was unquestionably a stranger ? " Supper will be served in an hour , " she called after him . " I 'll be here , " he replied . Jack stood in front of the wavy mirror over Miss Olivia Wilcott Darling 's spare-room bureau , assessing himself . He looked like one of those old codgers who lived off in the tucks and folds of nowhere , and all of the sudden his beard itched fit to set him to scratching like a hound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , he thought , with a long sigh . No sense getting reckless . He was n't ready to be recognized , not just yet , anyhow . So he washed at the basin , with the hot water Miss Olivia had provided , and put on his spare shirt . After supper , he would have to go out again and find shelter for the roan , as he 'd left the poor critter tethered in front of the Brimstone Saloon , but for now he meant to enjoy the rare and singular pleasure of taking a meal with a handsome woman . Miss Olivia was tall , lithe as the willows that had once grown alongside the creek back home . Her hair was a rich reddish brown color , like fine rosewood polished with beeswax , and her eyes put him in mind of the kind of sherry genteel folks drank , when they had cause to celebrate . He leaned forward , his hands braced against the edges of the bureau , and once again gazed at himself in the mirror . " You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She 's a lady , Miss Olivia is , and a Yankee at that . Not interested in the likes of you , Jack McLaughlin . " He frowned . The name felt threadbare all of the sudden , grayed by time and worn through , like an old pair of long johns , and he wished he could discard it , square his shoulders , hold up his head , and set the truth right out there in plain sight . Yet he did n't dare , he knew that . His backbone curved , and his shoulders sagged . He was a coward , pure and simple , a yellow-belly . He 'd been trying to escape that one , horrible , irretrievable , cast-in-stone day for better than half his life , and he was likely to continue , futile as it was . He should n't have come to Springwater in the first place . The thing to do , he decided , was eat supper with Miss Olivia , leave her with the gold piece for her trouble , and get out . Ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never so much as think about coming back . He raised his head and this time saw contempt in his eyes . Contempt for himself . " You 're not going anywhere , " he said fiercely , and then he turned his back on his own image . Olivia went outside , lantern in hand , cornered one of the hens in the chicken house , wrung its neck , and prepared it for the soup kettle with dispatch , a talent she had developed only after her arrival in Springwater . The first few times , she 'd nearly retched , but now she could swing an ax , clean a carcass , and pluck feathers as ably as any farmwife in the territory . By the time Mr. McLaughlin appeared , looking brushed and scrubbed and wearing , she could n't help noticing , a fairly fresh shirt , that bird was boiling on the stove , steaming up the window over the sink and filling the house with a delicious aroma . " I 've made dumplings , " she said , feeling only slightly less rattled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot of coffee . If it would n't keep you awake , that is . " " I 'd enjoy drinking somebody 's coffee besides my own , " he said . He did n't take a seat at the table , although it was set . Somewhere along the line , Jack McLaughlin , drifter , had learned at least a modicum of good manners . It was a heartening thing to know . " Thank you very much . " Olivia inclined her head to indicate the table . " Go ahead and sit down , Mr. McLaughlin . I do n't mind serving your food . This is n't a social occasion , after all . " He hesitated briefly , then drew back one of the chairs and sat . " You get many boarders ? " he asked , sounding as shy and awkward as she felt . She shook her head . Might as well be honest , since she had a choice in the matter . She had Mr. McLaughlin 's twenty-dollar gold piece , and she was n't about to give it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , lifting the lid off the chicken and dumplings and blinking away a rush of steam . " Most people stay down at the Springwater Station . " He arched an eyebrow , watching as she pumped water into the blue enamel coffeepot at the sink . " Oh ? Why 's that ? " She set the pot on the stove , took a glass jar down from the shelf , and scooped coffee beans , ground by Cornucopia at the general store just the day before , into the small metal basket . " Mrs. McCaffrey  --  June-bug  --  is a fine cook . Folks just seem to take to her , and to her husband , too . " He was quiet for so long that Olivia finally broke down and glanced his way . " Mr. McLaughlin ? " He smiled , but it seemed like an effort . With a sinking heart , Olivia began to suspect that her precious boarder already regretted staying in her establishment instead of at the station . " Must be hard to make a living , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took Olivia a moment to sort out what he meant : he was n't referring to the McCaffreys and their thriving business , but to her own pitiful efforts at supporting herself . Aunt Eloise had been right , she thought , with an inward sigh . She had n't the stalwart nature for running a frontier rooming house ; she should have stayed in Ohio , crocheting and teaching Sunday school , given a few piano lessons perhaps , and lived in dignified poverty , off the interest on her modest inheritance . " Yes , " she admitted , softly . A little reflectively . " Yes , it 's hard . I guess that makes me a bona-fide member of the human race . " He chuckled . " You 're not much given to self-pity are you , Miss Darling ? " Using two crumpled dish towels for pot holders , Olivia hoisted the kettle of simmering chicken off the stove and carried it across the room . " What good would that do ? " she countered , setting the meal down on the table with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the coffeepot a little shake . " Feeling sorry for myself , I mean ? " " Not much , I guess , " he allowed , resting his hands on the table , fingers interlaced . " Still , sometimes that 's the only way a body can get any sympathy . " She realized he was teasing and might have smiled , except that the coffee started to boil and she had to hurry back to the stove and take the pot off the heat . " Sympathy , " she said , upon her return to the table , " weakens the character . " He watched as she pulled back her own chair and sat down across from him . He had not touched the food , although she could see that he was ravenously hungry . In fact , in the spill of shadowy lamplight , he looked downright gaunt , as though he 'd been wandering the face of the earth for a long time , with nowhere to settle in . " Maybe , " he allowed , after some thought . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does n't it ? " She did n't know how to answer , and so reached for Mr. McLaughlin 's dish and the ladle , simultaneously . Though she would normally have offered a brief blessing before eating , she was so distracted that she forgot entirely . Instead , she served up her boarder 's supper and set the food before him . " It seems to me that there 's no profit in pretending the world is anything other than cold , " she said , realizing only after the words were out of her mouth how embittered they must have made her sound . Well , perhaps she was a little bitter . As a child , she 'd envisioned herself as a smiling and balanced adult , with a loving husband and several lively offspring . Instead , she 'd wound up nursing Aunt Eloise through a series of illnesses , some real and just as many others imagined , and after a few years , she 'd begun to abandon her dreams , one by one . Now , they were all gone . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual sounds from the Brimstone Saloon , down at the corner . Olivia held that particular establishment in very low esteem . Mr. McLaughlin ate with gratifying appreciation . " You sit right there , " he said , when Olivia would have gone to the stove for the coffee . " Finish your supper . You take sugar or cream ? " Olivia was , for a moment , too startled to respond . No one , but for June-bug McCaffrey , during her brief stay at the station , when she 'd first arrived in Springwater the winter before , had served her anything in as long as she could recall . If she 'd had her wits about her , she would have told him that she did n't take coffee at night . Instead , she replied , " With sugar , thank you . It 's there on the shelf next to the stove . " He brought the sugar bowl to the table , along with two fragrant cups brimming with fresh , stoutly brewed coffee . She would n't get a wink of sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a treat , having someone in the house , even if he was only a drifter , badly in need of barbering . " What brings you to Springwater , Mr. McLaughlin ? " she asked . Just like that , his face lost all expression . It was as though he 'd pulled a set of wooden shutters closed with a decisive snap . She waited . " I do n't reckon on staying long , " he said , when he saw that she was n't going to back off from the question . It had been a reasonable thing to ask , after all , given that he would be spending the night  --  perhaps many nights  --  under her roof . " I 've got some business to attend to , when the time 's right . Then I 'll be moving on . " She sat a little nearer the edge of her chair , concerned . He sounded so mysterious , almost secretive , as though his " business " in Springwater might be less than honorable . " It takes an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Folks do n't come here by accident , or just for something to do . " He took a sip of his coffee , eyeing her over the rim of his mug . Perhaps , she thought , she 'd been foolhardy , renting a room to someone she did n't know . On the other hand , if she was n't going to cater to strangers , she might as well move into the nearest poorhouse and be done with it . " I 'm looking for a place to winter over , " he said , at long last . " When I heard about Springwater , back in Choteau , I figured it would do as well as anywhere else . The Jupiter and Zeus silver mine is here , is n't it ? I reckon I might find work there . " Olivia rose from her chair and began to clear the table . " I imagine there 's work in Choteau , too , " she observed , without looking at him . Why , she wondered yet again , was she trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd come to Springwater herself ? Was it because he 'd stirred her emotions and senses , without apparent effort ? She heard his chair scrape lightly against the floorboards as he stood . " I 'll just see to my horse , " he said quietly , and then he was gone . Olivia held her breath , figuratively at least , until much later when , reading in her room , she heard him enter the house and climb the stairs . He paused outside her door . " Good night , Miss Olivia , " he said . Olivia 's heart was thumping ; had she lost her mind ? For all she knew , the man could be a rounder and a rascal . An outlaw . Even a murderer , bent on vengeance . " Good night , " she replied , all the same .
