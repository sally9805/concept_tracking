THE MORNING AFTER X LEARNED that my wife had taken a lover , my left leg began to ache . The pain excruciated . It resided in the lower half of the leg , from the knee down , where it felt as though two doctors with opposing , radical theories of treatment had taken hold of the muscle with tongs and were pulling with fierce conviction , each in her own direction . I had done nothing to injure the leg . Therefore I assumed that this pain was the vehicle by which my organism , body and soul in conflicted consort , had chosen to convey its response to betrayal . <p> The discovery was distressingly casual . One night Lorelei woke from a velvet sleep , sat up in bed , hugged her arms to her chest , and intoned with dreamy understatement , " Oh , Edward , my need . " <p> I am cursed with light sleep . The momentary rocking of a chair , down from which Lorelei 's piebald cat Roll jumped , had been enough to wake me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recall Lorelei 's having mentioned an Edward from her private past . She lay down immediately and began to snore faintly , as though the urgency that had punctured her sleep now reclaimed her , directing her back to the securely fenced territory of forgetfulness . <p> The next day , returning from work , I looked for and found the signs of outing I had certainly not expected to find on display in my wife . Lorelei is a welterweight with pale skin , long black hair she likes to braid , and a litheness of body few forty-plus women enjoy . She sells cosmetics . Not exactly door to door , but she carries a heavy sample case and spends a great deal of time in her Lexus , mediating frequently between customers and headquarters on her cellular telephone . When she is not selling upscale unguents , Lorelei is to be found working out at the gym . I had mistaken the radiant flush with which she returned home before dinner for a simple workout glow ; the palpable sense of satisfaction she dripped for the righteous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I should note that this happened in the city of X , to which we moved several years ago , in 19xx , when I was offered the position of chief scientist for a medium-sized software development company . I prefer not to name the company , which you would likely recognize . Nor will I pinpoint our city . I have come to appreciate the convention of referring to a location by a single letter , as nineteenth-century novelists did . Such delicate obliquity encourages us to presume the reality of a place , of course , but it does something more . The coded anonymity presupposes a realm of privacy : You ca n't , thank God , go there . I for one found the notion of living in such a protected space enormously tempting . <p> In the days following my discovery , I began to lose my grasp of the vernacular . Blame it on the stress , and on the pain in my leg . Were you to stop me on the street and ask for directions , I would of course address you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , I spoke naturally about the up-and-down career of our Triple A baseball team . I spoke just as nimbly with Blank , who founded our company and recruited me from a competitor . <p> Blank is fond of trapping me in the parking lot when I 'm ready to leave work . His prowling presence reminds me of the supreme value the man places on dedication to his brainchild . He would deny any more than sociable intention in his cruising , and his denial would be sincere . The overseer instinct is deeply submerged in him . It wears a dark cloak and strides an observation deck the existence of which he is not aware . <p> He may not talk about work in his parking-lot encounters , but Blank can not quite resist the temptation to proselytize . Not long after my suspicion about Lorelei was confirmed , he engaged me in a discussion of his plan to buy up a small country  --  Paraguay , perhaps , or Guyana  --  and run it at a distance as a benevolent despot , enforcing ecologically responsible management of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charity , he admitted , but there might also be some money in it . He wanted me , as his chief scientist and the cerebral engine of so much company growth , to have dibs on the early investment . He was careful not to use the term " ground floor . " <p> Blank is thirty-one . His astounding success has meant that he never learned to scale back either his screwier ideas or his acquisitive impulse . He chafes at barriers , regarding them as a personal affront to his prerogatives , which are unbounded . He wears an unintentionally dour face , lamentably scarred from a childhood disease . In conversation he tends to fling his thoughts at his interlocutor and then quickly avert his glance , as if reluctant to witness the damage he has inflicted . <p> For better or worse , comeuppance is an antique word . It only makes sense in an antique moral world , no longer humanly inhabited , in which actions and their consequences ineluctably touch one another . More than likely , Blank will never get his . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he wanted to know . " I notice you 're walking kind of funny . " <p> " My leg is fine , " I lied . " I 'll get back to you about Guyana . " <p> " It could be an African country , as far as that goes . What do you know about Mali besides Timbuktu ? " <p> As I watched him slink away , lynxlike , toward his Grand Cherokee , the instructive words with which Lorelei had given her secret away returned : " Oh , Edward , my need . " In another age she might have said eternal soul , or heart , or spirit . The reduction of my wife 's deepest imperative to nothing more than bare need saddened me , and I wondered what it was , precisely , that had been taken out of the world . <p> I drove home following the soft-edged bends of the river Y , an unpretentious tributary of the more celebrated Z , the inspiration of so many chapters in the big book of our national folklore . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a roadside park with a view of the burbling river . The air was dry and brisk , with the feel of a fine powder . A nominal V of laggard Canadian geese was also following the river south . Take me with you , I said to them . I never speak to migrating geese . I resolved not to capitulate to despair . <p> I decided to approach my problem as though it were a software project in the larval stage , predevelopment , when instinct and inspiration clasp hands and walk through the dark at a pace only they can determine . I had already considered and discarded the possibility of confronting Lorelei . I shrank from the prospect of toasting my flesh and hers at an emotional bonfire . My work had biased me to believe that the purpose of problems was to justify solutions . I let the geese disappear without a second plea . <p> At dinner that evening Lorelei 's chipper chirping almost undid me . All her adjectives were superlatives . The cutlets I prepared were the most delicious she had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mordant glance our son , Rex , flung at her convinced me that he , too , suspected . <p> " You really should see Dr. Blanton tomorrow morning about that leg , " Lorelei said , pointing fingers I still found swooningly attractive at my guilty limb . <p> When Rex , who is fifteen , asked me to drive him to the mall , I panicked . What was the proper tack to take ? Should I lie ? Should I ask him to summon from within the forgiveness I could not dredge up myself ? Should we tie one on together , then grab a tire iron and go looking for the cad who had turned sweet Lorelei 's head ? But it was not his mother who was on Rex 's mind . <p> " I do n't really need anything at the mall , Dad . " <p> " Good . Do n't be taken in by the blandishments of advertisers . " <p> " My friends ' parents never use the word blandishments when they talk to them . " <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive for a while ? " <p> " We can . " <p> In fact , we did . <p> " Did you ever want to be someone else ? " he asked me at mile five . <p> " I guess we all get tired of being who we are once in a while . It 's a normal thing to feel . " <p> Except that what my son was feeling went considerably beyond normal . He had fixed  --  fixated , really  --  on an acquaintance at school , an African-American boy whose mother was spending a couple of seasons as guest conductor of our highly rated symphony orchestra . His father flew in periodically from Nepal , where he led a team of medical researchers in pursuit of a defense against a vicious parasite that dragged its human host to a slow , painful death . By chance , their son was also named Rex . <p> My Rex ( Rex 1 ) had decided he wanted to be their son ( Rex 2 ) . Rex 2 had , did , was , everything . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges and assignments for the gifted and talented , he starred as a running back in football , served as captain of the crew team , and played error-free first base on the varsity . He sang a substantial tenor , sight-reading the most difficult trills . With diplomatic verve , he managed to point out the calculus teacher 's occasional blackboard errors without offending her or causing resentment in his classmates . <p> " So what does n't this kid do , Rex ? " <p> " When I see him in the hall between classes , I pretend I 'm him . " <p> " What 's wrong with being you ? " <p> " What 's right with being me ? I hate myself . " <p> I knew I was not going to talk him out of his self-loathing , however transitory . So much for all those self-esteem manuals Lorelei absorbed when the boy was in his tender years . It was probably the wrong thing to do , but when he asked , I drove Rex to the neighborhood in which Rex 2 lived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big houses with high resale value and little turnover . We parked in front , and Rex sat staring at the curtained windows , certain that the main thing they were hiding was the secret of success . <p> " Now what ? " <p> " I want to start my life over , Dad . I want to be him . " <p> " I do n't know if I can help you on that one . I 'm not black , I 'm not a doctor , and I damn sure ca n't carry a tune , let alone conduct the Philharmonic . " <p> " It 's not fair . " <p> I wanted to tell him that few things were . I wanted to tell him a parable that would make him feel better . I wanted to stuff my fist down the throat of the large-souled parasite expert in Nepal . It was n't fair . Without waiting for Rex 's permission , I started the car and drove away from the neighborhood of his would-be alter ego . I bought him an ice cream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked when I handed him the cone . <p> " I must have bumped into something . Listen , Rex . I 've seen people like this friend of yours before . " <p> " He 's not my friend . We never even talk . " <p> " Sometimes too much of a good thing spoils a person . You 're a smart kid . You work hard . You 're funny . On top of that , you 're wonderfully generous . By the time you 're twenty-five you 'll leave this other Rex in the dust . " <p> He shook his head . My platitudes fell like BBs plinking against a grizzly bear 's haunch . We ate our ice cream . <p> That night I pretended to be asleep when Lorelei got out of bed , sat in the cat 's chair , and smoked a cigarette . We had quit together a few years earlier , when Rex bombarded us with the propaganda with which the school had bombarded him . She ground out the butt in a soap dish , opened a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my side of the bed and inspected my bad leg , which throbbed in response . <p> Impulsively I told her , " I 'm losing my grasp of the vernacular . " <p> She thought I was talking in my sleep . <p> For some reason , that odd quasi-encounter at midnight was the goad I 'd been lacking to come up with a strategy . I was deeply hurt , less by the deception than by my irrelevance to my wife 's need for adventure and change . Since my organism had decided for me that the leg would be the locus of the hurt , however , the rest of me was freed to react positively . I reacted . If it was n't a full-blown strategy at least it was something to do . <p> I will presume that you would just as soon be spared the details of our intimacy , that you have been sated with the prurience-by-extension that American media life has popularized . But I will say that I thought our love life was not half bad . I made a consistent effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plague me when I lay down in bed next to Lorelei . Nevertheless ... <p> I understood that I was no longer interesting to my wife , and that , like it or not , a gossamer web stretched between interest and desire . So be it , so it was . I needed to become more interesting . But to interest Lorelei , I needed to be more interesting to myself . <p> So I quit my job . That day . When I told him I was leaving , Blank assumed I had been recruited by another company , as he had recruited me . <p> " Bullshit , " he said . He was seldom thwarted . <p> He was staring at a sketch of a blowzy woman bathing . Blank had bought the drawing , which was attributed to one of the lesser-known Pre-Raphaelites , on a recent trip to England . He fretted that he had paid too much , and worry spoiled his enjoyment of the sketch . " OK , do n't tell me who scammed me . I 'll find out soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Are we speaking legally ? " <p> " Get out of here , traitor . Your presence is causing me intense internal distress , and that 's not good . " <p> Before I went home I stopped at the roadside park , thought slow thoughts for a few minutes , then left a voice-mail message on Lorelei 's cellular phone . I knew my plan was only going to work if I meant what I said . " I 'm going to Nepal , " went part of my message . " Or Timbuktu . I 'm not sure yet . I 'm going to become black . Rex needs this from me . " <p> I watched two black squirrels with pointy ears quarrel over a nut , though the ground was strewn with them . When my own cell phone rang I knew it was Lorelei . I did n't answer . The ringing disconcerted the squirrels , which retreated into the woods . Thereafter I watched a green mallard wing its solitary way southward down the broad , invisible flyway . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a seventh-floor view of ramshackle roofs and wet stone streets , the steep length of which men and animals were forever trudging . I had never spent time in a place in which people trudged . Watching them produced a quiet bewilderment in me . I grudgingly conceded Rex 2 's father a little more respect than I had in the city of X. The doctor must be miles beyond the altitude sickness that attacked newcomers . I was not . My head ached , my mouth was cottony dry , my attention span was as short as a two-year-old 's . The smell of yak butter did n't help . No matter where I went in the city , my nostrils filled with an oily , smoky odor I could not identify but chose to believe was yak butter . <p> Waiting for the sickness to subside , I sent pithy e-mail messages to Rex at home . Lorelei , he informed me , did not believe I was actually in Nepal . She assumed , for reasons of her own , that I was holed up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , pouting and reviewing my options . Rex knew better . He made me promise that I would not look up Rex 2 's father and embarrass both of us . I promised . Now that I was there , I had little desire to confront the man . I wanted to walk around Katmandu looking for parables , but my leg was hurting fiercely . <p> Resting on an iron bench in a grimly brown , battered space that passed for a city park , I thought about Pam , the mechanic who kept my 1963 Triumph Spitfire running . She was an ashy blonde , chunky in coveralls , who smoked Camels and read The Economist on her coffee breaks . She devoted serious effort to debunking the conspiracy theories about what was going wrong in the world that her fellow mechanics favored . We went to a Dunkin ' Donuts for coffee , where she asked probing questions about why artificial intelligence had not developed as predicted in the popular press . <p> Pam was divorced , the mother of twin daughters in the fourth grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was conscious of but not afraid of the income gap that divided us . When she took me home for lunch one day , she served grilled tuna-fish sandwiches and homemade macaroni-and-cheese . Neither of us wanted the bottle of Chilean white wine I had impulsively brought along . <p> It was Pam who stopped us . Me , I was dazed by the unique erotic thrill of watching her plain white bra and then her medium round breasts emerge from beneath her coveralls . All my hunger was in my hands . We lay on the couch in a bliss of expectation . <p> Too quickly she sat up , shaking her head . " What I want and what I need ca n't be the same thing , Brian . It scares me when they come together . " <p> So I found another mechanic . If it had been up to me , we would have navigated our way across the shoals of a brief affair , then stepped on shore and walked away , separately embittered , from one another . On the iron bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fidelity to Lorelei was the consequence of the self-regarding scruple of a mechanic who specialized in British sports cars . By the terms of the logic of actions and consequences to which I still clung , I was not in much of a position to be outraged by my wife 's deception . <p> Before leaving the city of X for Nepal , I tracked Lorelei one afternoon from the gym to a Wild West-motif saloon . At the swinging doors she was greeted by a young man with stiff short hair , a prominent earring , and absurdly overdeveloped arm muscles . His welcoming kiss was a travesty of passion . I was parked a hundred yards away , where the pain in my leg completely immobilized me . <p> The very bleakness of the would-be park exercised a bizarre pull on me . Its drab face spoke to me , for me , about me . For several days I dragged my bad leg over terrible sidewalks to sit for hour-long stretches on the same iron bench . I was incapable of connected thought . I contented myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the streets around me . I was peripherally aware of the waif but took her for an aspect of the scenery , a 3-D detail embossed on the flat city surface . She did not approach me until the morning of my fourth visit to the park . <p> " What 's wrong with your leg , mister ? " <p> " Nothing . Please do n't call me mister . " <p> " What you 're looking for is n't here , " she said , clapping her hands as if to acknowledge the speed of her insight , which was arrowlike . <p> " I know that , " I told her . <p> She was a miniature , even smaller and more compact than Lorelei . Her clothes were dirty , but her hands and her diamond-shaped face looked clean . The long wool coat into which she was buttoned was at least two sizes too big . ( How she acquired the coat would be a story I had little interest in hearing . ) The life had gone out of her red hair , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture of unhealth . <p> " I can take you there , " she offered . I assumed that too much time in straitened circumstances contributed to the aggrieved suspicion darkening her voice . <p> " How old are you ? " <p> " I need money . There are people in this mountain city that will fuck you fast for dollars , boys and girls , men and women , but I 'm not one of them . " <p> " Where is it that you think I want to go ? " <p> Her grin drew a thin , tight line between deference and collusion . " The center of the universe . " <p> The center of the universe was a room with walls the color of mustard on the fifth floor of a Katmandu flophouse . Six-foot strips of multicolored aluminum foil tacked to the door celebrated the entrance . The strips glittered as they tossed in the interior breeze , drawing light from a source I could not identify . <p> " You never asked me my name , " the waif complained , barring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I assumed you were traveling under an alias . " <p> She liked that ; enough to confide her real name , which was not the one appended to her at birth . Storm . <p> " Storm ? " <p> " I 'm twenty-one . I 've known my name for more than four years . Most people die without learning theirs . That 's what living on the road does for you . Self-knowledge . " <p> If there had ever been any , the beds had been removed from the center of the universe . The floor was covered patchily with defunct mattresses and high-mileage sleeping bags , on several of which inert bodies lay muffled . In the approximate center of the room stood a totem pole of wood on which half a dozen stern animal faces were carved , and painted , and evidently worshiped . A shower of pocket change from many countries had fallen on the floor around the pole , tokens of propitiation that did n't spend in Nepal . Rhymed prayers and incantations interspersed with magic-marker drawings of psychic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman on her knees continued to beat the tambourine that had mesmerized her . The smell of yak butter was overpowering , everywhere . So was the smell of dope . <p> " You have to look past the obvious shit , " Storm warned me . <p> " To see what 's really here .... " <p> " Disillusion is the last illusion . " <p> She lay on her back on a mattress near the totem pole . I eased my leg down and lay next to her on another mattress . <p> " I 'm going to give you some money , " I told her . <p> " What do you want for it ? " <p> " Advice to the loveshorn . " <p> " You 're a married guy , are n't you ? " <p> " My wife has a lover . He has very large biceps . " <p> " Do you want her back ? " <p> I thanked her . I gave her $250 . If she had taken it , I would have bought her a ticket back home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a reason whose depth I could not fathom with a kite string , I had to go to Nepal so that a dirty road waif could ask me the only question that mattered , the one I had n't been able to ask myself . <p> I must have been exhausted . I fell asleep on the mattress alongside the totem pole that marked the geographic center of the universe . When I woke , the room was full of celebrants . There was chanting . There were the oddly compatible odors of yak butter and hashish . There was panpipe music , and Indian drums , and an all too willing suspension of disbelief . Storm was no longer in the room . <p> I went back to the city of X but not home . I rented an apartment in the section of the city in which the immigrants rented theirs . The faces on the street were Vietnamese and Salvadoran and Filipino . Rex came to visit two or three times a week . Sometimes he brought Rex 2 along . We talked about Nepal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-optation of dissent in late-capitalist society . I was relieved and grateful to see the desire to be someone else tapering off noticeably in my son as he developed an easy friendship with Rex 2 . Together , the two talked like unexceptional teens , slang and unimaginative insults and repeated formulations of hormonal discontent . They conspired against me in my generational blindness . Their conspiracy was a beautiful thing to behold . <p> Once , Rex mentioned that my wife 's lover had begun to spend time at the house . He had not yet found a career , but traveled regularly to major cities around the country to participate in poetry slams . Lorelei had promised Rex that the situation would eventually clarify itself . She wondered if he hated her . <p> " Do you hate her , Rex ? " <p> " I tried to hate Edward for a while . I tried to hate Mom , and you , and myself . " <p> " That did n't work ? " <p> " Not too well . I 'm sorry , Dad . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the garage where Pam worked , but all she was willing to talk about was carburetors . The other mechanics , all men , glowered at me . I have never been able to put up with much glowering . <p> Winter happened . Left alone , I began spending more and more time in a place where there was no need for the vernacular . To get there you had to go by coach over a pike road . The coachman was obsequious if you carried yourself with the air of a person of quality . Nuance thrived there , and the gradations by which people measured one another were infinitely subtle . Most of the houses were large , with servants ' quarters attached . The dogs guarding the gates were all black mastiffs , and most men smoked cigars . In the evening , after dinner , adult property owners took their constitutionals around placid blocks . The gossip in which they engaged was vicious and brilliant . All forms of entertainment available were socially sanctioned and often as not quite boring . Whenever I posted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city of X. All the sentences I spoke to myself were long and properly punctuated . Perhaps I would have been content there . But the pain in my left leg spoiled any chance I had of settling in . <p> When I ran into Lorelei at a grocery store neither of us had frequented when we were living together , she asked me about Nepal , and about my leg . <p> " I met a young woman in Katmandu , " I told her . <p> " If this is a smutty limerick I do n't want to hear it . " She looked slightly bedraggled , a little haggard . She appeared to be afraid of me . Seeing her fear produced no pleasure in me . <p> " She had floor space at the center of the universe . " <p> " For crying out loud , Brian . Do you want to torture me ? This is how you 've always dealt with stressful situations , is n't it ? " <p> " She asked whether I wanted my wife back . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her some money . I was grateful that she asked the question . " <p> " What 's your opinion of poetry slams ? " <p> " Is this an invitation to visit ? " <p> " I 'm less than perfect , I know that . As a woman . There 's a motorcycle in the garage . I want to get rid of it . " <p> So I followed her home and wheeled an ugly old purple Honda 750 out into the street . I resented the grease stain the machine had left on the garage 's concrete floor . I put my resentment in perspective . We stood inside the living room , drinking excellent Kenyan coffee and watching , as if we knew that sooner rather than later Edward would come strolling up the sidewalk . He stood for a moment inspecting the Honda for damage . When he was satisfied there was none , he drove it away . <p> " Do you think that well-fed Americans talk too much ? " Lorelei wanted to know . <p> " The ones who see themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a victim , Brian ? " <p> I told her I did n't . <p> " Good , " she said . " Do you want more coffee ? " <p> " I 'll have half a cup . " <p> " Blank called the other day . Did I tell you ? I told him you were still in Katmandu . He thinks you stole his idea about buying a country . He 's paranoid , is n't he ? He wants you back . " <p> " He wants my brain , and my brain 's software-development prowess . " <p> " What about your leg ? " <p> " The pain is gradually going away . It 's OK . " <p> " That 's another thing people do too much of , complain . Have you noticed that ? I really admire the way you are n't talking about how much your leg hurts . " <p> " What about Christmas ? " <p> " There 's nothing that Rex really wants . He 's past the gim me phase , thank goodness . What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " A cruise . " <p> " So what did you tell her ? " <p> " Tell who ? " <p> " The woman in Katmandu who asked if you wanted your wife back . " <p> I hesitated . In a certain field that I could visualize if I closed my eyes , long and complicated responses grew like instant weeds until they blocked the horizon . I chopped the weeds . <p> " Yes , " I said . " I told her yes . " <p> Lorelei was crying , or on the salty verge of tears . I thought about crying myself . <p> " The cruise , " she said again , her usually crisp saleswoman 's voice an atypical blur . " Where do you think we should go ? " <p> " Anywhere , " I told her . " I 'd like to go anywhere , except the city of X. " <p> <p> By Mark Jacobs <p>
