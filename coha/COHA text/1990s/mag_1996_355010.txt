You 're going with Gorbachev , " the Moscow airport ticket clerk says scornfully . " If I had a gun I 'd kill him myself . " In Russia these days , such remarks are common . The last President of the former Soviet Union is reviled by many of those he once ruled . Free-market liberals disdain his vacillating support for economic reform ; Communists and nationalists detest him for his role in ending the empire . No matter . Gorbachev is waging a quixotic race for Russia 's presidency and this day is heading 700 miles south of the Kremlin to plead his case in Volgograd . <P> About 1,500 citizens pack the Palace of Culture and Art to hear the man so many love to hate . " I have no text , " Gorbachev says . " Ask your questions . " Instantly , a Russian air force general is shouting : " You bastard ! You traitor ! You destroyed the motherland . How dare you face the people ? " <P> And thus begins two hours during which Gorbachev yells , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free people , " he says . " I accept my share of responsibility for the mess we 're in , but remember that when I got power I set out to reform this country . You now have the freedom to choose , but you must learn how . You must debate civilly . If you want stability , which you think you have lost , you must first learn respect for law , especially since some still want to shut you up . " <P> A chorus of heckling rises and subsides . Gorbachev presses on . " Yeltsin 's reforms have benefited no more than 10% of the population , " he says . " That must stop . " A few dozen in the audience now rise , clapping . " On the other hand , " he adds quickly , spreading his arms to still the applause , " we must not forget how many ordinary citizens the Communists oppressed . Do you think they will not do the same if you vote for them now ? " <P> " About Yeltsin , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the railroad tracks if prices went up . " <P> " Well maybe he did , " Gorbachev says , " but under him the trains do n't run regularly . " When the laughter stops , Gorbachev becomes grave . " I made a mistake trusting Yeltsin , " he says , " but you elected him the first time , so you made a mistake too . Think hard before you make the same mistake again , and remember that no matter who wins , the result must be respected . What we need most at this time is a straight , free , democratic election . " <P> Gradually the hostility turns to neutrality and then to respect  --  but not support . Too much is at stake , explain several people as they exit . " We ca n't waste our votes and help the Communists , " says one . " We 'll have to go with Yeltsin . " <P> The Russians have a saying : " One beaten man is worth two unbeaten ones . " Experience , Gorbachev says , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So think of Mikhail Gorbachev as a beaten man fighting back . His chances are slim , and he knows it , but he has something to say and is determined to say it . " I set the course that has given people the right to make this choice , " he says . " Who more than I has a right to run ? " Asked if the prospect of history 's kind verdict is comforting , the man who says , " I have seen it all , " responds skeptically : " History is a capricious creature . It depends on who writes it . " <P>  --  By Michael Kramer and Yuri Zarakhovich
