1 RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE The Battle of Los Angeles ( Epic ) . Because Tom Morello  --  who can make his guitar sound like a harmonica , a pair of turntables or a street uprising  --  is the most thrilling guitarist in rock today . Because rapper-singer Zack de la Rocha mixes poetry and polemics into song lyrics that would do Chuck D or Bob Dylan proud . Because in a year in which a riot of rockers copped beats from hip-hop , no other band made the rap-rock union resonate with such ferocity and intelligence . <P> 2 THE ROOTS Things Fall Apart ( MCA ) . This Philadelphia-based band named its CD after a novel by Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe : very cool . And while other rap acts rely on canned beats , the Roots play instruments ( guitars , drums , etc. ) , giving their work unique vibrancy and depth . Let the cartoon gangstas cater to suburban stereotypes  --  the Roots are keeping it real . <P> 3 BRAD MEHLDAU Elegiac Cycle ( Warner Bros . ) . A 29-year-old pianist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace and jazz improvisation , he has created a masterly album about loss ; virtually every track has the liquid warmth of a freshly shed tear . Moments of genius in music are rare as diamonds . This CD sparkles like a display case at Tiffany . <P> 4 NINE INCH NAILS The Fragile ( Nothing/Interscope ) . Into the orgy of urgently escapist pop that ruled music this year , Trent Reznor dropped this monument to loneliness and psychic angst . A powerful and creepily beautiful rock-'n ' - roll album , The Fragile brought hope to alienated youth everywhere . <P> 5 SANTANA Supernatural ( Arista ) . Let 's face it : most ' 60s rockers have headed out to pasture . But with a little help from his friends ( Lauryn Hill , Everlast ) , 52-year-old Carlos Santana stayed alive by renewing the formula that once took him to the top : blues , Hendrix-style guitar work and chugging Afro-Latin rhythms . Rock history , written by lightning fingers . <P> 6 FIONA APPLE When the Pawn ... ( Clean Slate/Epic ) . Like shards from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reflective surfaces and sharp edges . Apple 's songs , richly produced and intimately performed , explore the opposite of romance : betrayal , breakup , failure to commit . Apple has matured into more than a pop prodigy , more than a girl , interrupted . She is now , as an artist , a woman in full . <P> 7 KIM RICHEY Glimmer ( Mercury ) . " From the ashes some glimmer of the truth appears , " sings this veteran Nashville thrush . But her wise , smoky voice does n't languish in the ashes of self-pity or revenge . There 's buoyancy and gravity , musical variety and sneaky lyric craft in this endlessly listenable set . Glimmer glows . <P> 8 LES NUBIANS Princesses Nubiennes ( Omtown ) . Helene and Celia Faussart , singing sisters from Bordeaux , France , boast a global sound : they take African rhythms and American soul and top them off with a cool , seductive delivery that 's distinctively French . A magical musical package tour . <P> 9 CONSTANT LAMBERT Tiresias/Pomona ( Hyperion ) . Constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its 1951 premiere , then went unplayed for 40 years . This recording ( performed by the English Northern Philharmonia , conducted by David Lloyd Jones and happily coupled with the ballet Pomona ) gives a second chance to a masterpiece .
