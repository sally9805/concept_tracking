What made the mortar shell that burst in Sarajevo 's central market that Saturday morning different from the innumerable other rounds that have slammed into the Bosnian capital over the previous 22 months ? " Strategically it meant nothing , " says a senior U.S. diplomat . But the grisly footage broadcast round the globe showing 68 people blown to bits while peacefully shopping made for peculiarly revolting television . The timing of the attack , seemingly planned to kill the greatest possible number of innocent civilians , dramatized the brutality of the war all over again to a world populace that had grown benumbed to reports of concentration camps , ethnic cleansing , mass rape and daily casualties . <P> The market images prompted a Western outcry that this time the Serbs had gone too far , that U.S. credibility was at stake , and that the NATO alliance was in jeopardy . Something had to be done . The answer last week was an ultimatum to the Serbs to stop shelling Sarajevo or face allied bombs . But have n't we heard all that before ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western threats to intervene to stop the slaughter . Only a month ago , a disgusted State Department official had summed up President Clinton 's strategy : " The object of U.S. policy is to keep Bosnia out of the headlines . Every day it 's not in the news is another day of success . " The 120-mm shell that hit the market made that policy a thundering failure and raised embarrassing questions : If even this could not move Clinton and the leaders of Western Europe to act , would anything do so ? If not , how could anyone believe anything they said ever again ? <P> The 16-nation NATO alliance responded with yet another warning , only this one was not so vague . It took the form of a flat ultimatum to the Serbs : Stop shelling Sarajevo . Pull back all big guns , heavy mortars and tanks 12.4 miles $ from the Bosnian capital or put them under U.N . control . And do it in 10 days , by 1 a.m . Feb. 21 , Sarajevo time . After that , NATO warplanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusion zone , or any artillery pieces still firing into Sarajevo from beyond it . <P> Strong language , and carrying something of the conviction born of despair . A long series of earlier warnings  --  most recently a NATO resolution last August authorizing air strikes to prevent the " strangulation " of Sarajevo  --  had sputtered to nothing . For that very reason , argued a NATO official , if the Serbs defy the new ultimatum " we have to attack . If we did n't , NATO 's credibility would suffer a fatal blow . " <P> But will air strikes or Serb compliance with the ultimatum actually do much to end the war and stop the killing ? The Pentagon is dubious that NATO planes can do much damage . In the face of past threats , the Serbs have proved adept at backing down just enough to keep things quiet for a while , then stepping up the fighting again . There is also a fear that the ultimatum and air strikes are a mere facade behind which the U.S. will help pressure Bosnia 's beleaguered Muslims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Serb aggression . One U.S. diplomat cynically believes some air strikes will in fact be conducted " because that will help us press the Bosnians to sign on to the dismemberment of their country . "
