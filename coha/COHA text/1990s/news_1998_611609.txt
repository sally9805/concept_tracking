<p> Lucio A. Noto , the outspoken chairman of Mobil Corp. , warned President Clinton a few months ago that the United States " will lose strategically and economically " if the U.S. embargo on trade with Iran limits the ability of American firms to explore for oil in the Persian Gulf and Caspian Sea while foreign competitors have free rein . <p> As a global company , Mobil chafes at restrictions imposed for strategic or political reasons that block its efforts to find oil and natural gas . But rather than dismiss the arguments of Mobil and other U.S. international companies as special pleading , the Clinton administration has decided they have a point . <p> According to senior officials , the proliferating use of economic sanctions as a foreign policy tool is creating regulatory chaos , confusion about objectives , strains in relations with allies and sometimes counterproductive responses  --  often without achieving the purpose for which the sanctions were designed . <p> In addition , some administration officials fear that opposition by other nations to U.S. efforts to impose its policies on them through trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trade Organization . <p> Enforcing and defending sanctions consumes vast amounts of time and effort from U.S. officials . Last week , Pope John Paul II called for an end to the long-standing U.S. embargo on trade with Cuba . In New York , American diplomats were shoring up support for stringent economic sanctions on Iraq . At the State Department , officials were preparing for a visit by British Prime Minister Tony Blair , who is expected to ask on behalf of the European Union that Washington refrain from imposing sanctions on a French oil company doing business with Iran . <p> The United States maintains a trade embargo , export or import restrictions or other forms of economic sanctions on at least 73 countries , according to trade groups . The purposes of the measures range from curbing the spread of nuclear weapons to discouraging the practice of female genital mutilation . No government agency maintains a comprehensive list . <p> Some sanctions involve billions of dollars in lost business for U.S. companies , such as the ban on doing business with Iran . Others are virtually cost-free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Nigeria Airways because of Nigeria 's alleged failure to curb international drug traffic . <p> In an effort to bring order out of this chaos , the State Department recently created a " sanctions team " to run an administration-wide examination of the purpose , scope , cost and effectiveness of the existing sanctions and try to develop standards for using sanctions in the future . <p> " The challenge , " said Stuart E. Eizenstat , undersecretary of state for economic affairs , " is to find a way to improve the way we make sanctions decisions , to ensure that sanctions are part of a coherent strategy , to accurately measure the costs and effects of sanctions measures , to seek multilateral support where possible and to improve coordination between the administration and Congress . " <p> Eizenstat , who chaired the sanctions team 's first meeting last week , said the purpose of the exercise is " not to decrease the use of sanctions but to increase their effectiveness . " <p> The use of trade and investment restrictions to advance political or strategic interests has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provoking outrage from the affected business groups . <p> President Jimmy Carter , for example , banned the sale of U.S. grain to the Soviet Union after the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , a move that farm groups said had no impact on Moscow but cost U.S. farmers billions in sales and stimulated the growth of competing growers in Australia and Brazil . President Ronald Reagan prohibited U.S. suppliers from participating in the development of a natural gas pipeline from the Soviet Union to Western Europe , irritating NATO allies and sending potential U.S. construction contracts to suppliers in South Korea . <p> In recent years , however , the number and scope of sanctions has proliferated , according to several analysts , often mandated by a Congress concerned not just about such traditional issues as weapons proliferation but also about the environment , human rights or religious freedom . <p> " My membership in the past five years has seen an explosion in the legislative and executive branches of using economic sanctions unilaterally to moderate some other country 's behavior . It has become the weapon of choice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Chamber of Commerce , one of the most influential national business organizations . " We 're at the point of saying , ' Enough , already . ' " <p> Workman 's group , the National Association of Manufacturers and an anti-sanctions coalition of trade and farm organizations known as USA*Engage are supporting legislation sponsored by Sen. Richard G. Lugar ( R-Ind. ) and Reps . Lee H. Hamilton ( D-Ind. ) and Philip M. Crane ( R-Ill. ) that would try to do on Capitol Hill what Eizenstat is trying to do in the executive branch . <p> The bill would require that sanctions mandated by Congress be focused as narrowly as possible , be tied to a specific foreign policy objective and protect contracts already signed . It would authorize the president to issue waivers and sanctions would expire after two years unless reauthorized . The president would be required to report periodically to Congress on a sanction 's economic cost to the United States and on the likelihood that it would achieve its objectives . <p> " Sanctions should not be abandoned as a tool of foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last fall . But he expressed " disquiet " over their proliferation , noting that between 1993 and 1996 " there were some 63 instances involving 35 countries " in which the United States imposed some kind of economic sanction . <p> In an assessment widely shared by academic analysts and trade specialists , Lugar said unilateral sanctions " rarely succeed in altering the behavior " of the targeted country and " may inflict more harm on the U.S. than on the target country . " In addition , he said , unilateral sanctions " frequently create the illusion of action by substituting for more decisive action or serving as a palliative for those who demand some action , any action , be taken by the United States against another country . " <p> Lugar emphasized unilateral sanctions because there is general agreement that multilateral sanctions , such as those imposed by the U.N . Security Council on Iraq after the 1991 Persian Gulf War , are more likely to be effective and have less potential for damaging U.S. interests . <p> " Unilateral sanctions never work , " said former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impoverish people , but if you have a country that 's governed by a tyrant like Saddam Hussein or Fidel Castro , the tyrant does n't care about the people . Multilateral sanctions may take a long time , as they did in apartheid South Africa , but you have a better chance . " <p> Eizenstat said the administration fully agrees that multilateral sanctions are preferable , but it may still be difficult to achieve agreement between the administration and Congress on when or why sanctions should be imposed . The reason is that Congress  --  especially when controlled by a different party than the White House  --  often has different international objectives from those of the president . <p> For example , Congress is prepared to cut aid to Russia because of restrictions on religious freedom there and because of Russian assistance to Iran 's development of ballistic missiles . The administration , while supporting religious freedom and opposing the missile technology traffic , is opposed to sanctions on Russia because of a wider policy of developing long-term cooperation with Moscow . <p> On the other hand , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did last year on Burma and Sudan , whether Congress acts or not . <p> Mobil 's Noto , in his letter to Clinton , addressed a different problem : the conflict between competing objectives inherent in the ban on doing business with Iran . <p> Clinton is a committed free trader . But he also banned all U.S. trade with Iran and signed the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act , which requires him to impose sanctions on foreign firms that invest $ 20 million or more in Iran 's petroleum industry . Those actions have cut U.S. oil companies out of several deals in the fast-developing Caspian Sea oil fields , for which the logical pipeline export routes run through Iran . <p> The law appears to require the president to impose sanctions on the French oil firm Total and the giant Russian natural gas company Gazprom , which last year joined forces to develop Iran 's huge South Pars gas field . For foreign policy reasons , the president is reluctant to sanction Total and Gazprom . But if he waives sanctions , as Noto pointed out , he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening the door to their foreign competitors . <p> " If these issues are resolved such that U.S. industry can not compete on an equal basis for business opportunities in the Middle East , as well as in the Caspian Sea region , " Noto wrote , " not only will U.S. foreign policy be damaged but U.S. jobs and investment will be lost . " <p> That was in October . The administration is still considering what to do in the Total-Gazprom case . But meanwhile , Eizenstat said , the " sanctions team " has begun an effort to spell out the basis on which such decisions will be made in the future .
