<p> 1 . THE LOST WORLD , by Michael Crichton , Knopf , $ 25.95 <p> This is mostly a shameless reprise of " Jurassic Park . " Both T. Rex and the velociraptors are back , as bad as ever , chasing everyone and consuming all expendable characters . There is jungle , rain , lightning , and actual cliff hanging . And as usual the author lectures during pauses in the action . He speculates on extinction . Dinosaurs died because they constantly developed , chancing dysfunction . The pace is relentless , and you never know just what will happen . ( Monitor Review 9/20/95 ) By Ronald Preston <p> 2 . The Horse Whisperer , by Nicholas Evans , Delacorte Press , $ 23.95 <p> The storyline is formulaic , cliche laden , and noticeably influenced by " The Bridges of Madison County . " It depicts a strong tight- lipped Montana rancher able to see into the " soul " of horses , and a British cum New York successful magazine editor who experiences a midlife crisis when her daughter-on-horseback collides with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rancher . Parental guilt about putting career first emotionally tugs throughout this soap-opera . By Jim Bencivenga <p> 3 . MORNING , NOON , AND NIGHT , by Sidney Sheldon , Morrow , $ 24 <p> Sheldon 's latest McNovel follows the lives of a billionaire who drowns at sea and his three inheritance-hungry offspring . Controversy and mystery appear when an illegitimate daughter shows up in Boston to meet her long-lost siblings and claim her share of the empire . The book reads like a TV movie , hardly a surprise considering that Sheldon is also a screenwriter . His page-turner is full of plot twists and red herrings , but most of the author 's devices are borrowed or just plain predictable . By Kim Campbell <p> 4 . COME TO GRIEF , by Dick Francis , Putnam , $ 23.95 <p> Someone has been lopping a hoof off expensive young horses on English country estates , and sleuth Sid Halley traces the crime to an old friend and fellow ex-jockey , who is also a beloved television sports personality . Francis 's steeple chase of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetrator , tabloid journalists , greed-driven tycoons , and a tangle of emo tions . A virtual absence of blood , gore , and sex , it runs on psychological tension alone . By Keith Henderson <p> 5 . COMING HOME , by Rosamunde Pilcher , St. Martin 's Press , $ 25.95 <p> A lovely , old-fashioned read set in Cornwall in the 1930s and ' 40s . Pilcher 's smooth prose carries the reader effortlessly into the story of Judith Dunbar , an independent survivor who is left at school when her family moves to Singapore . She is soon swept up by the Carey-Lewises , a family whose prewar lives are as light and delicious as fizzy lemonade . Pilcher deftly recreates World War II England , chronicling the changes war brings to Judith and her adopted family with heartfelt insight . By Yvonne Zipp <p> 6 . ' L ' Is For Lawless , by Sue Grafton , Holt , $ 24 <p> The lastest Kinsey Millhone mystery , twelfth in Grafton 's alphabet series , serves up a veritable stew of outrageous characters . The mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's spry older brother to a maroon-haired Hungarian who runs a greasy spoon . Their impending nuptials and a nearsighted , gun-toting grandmother upstage the youngsters , who do nothing more original than look for stolen buried treasure . The ending is rather abrupt and unsatisfying . By Yvonne Zipp <p> 7 . BEACH MUSIC , by Pat Conroy , Doubleday/Talese , $ 27.50 <p> Seemingly every memory , character , place , and event from not only Conroy 's life , but also the lives of most of the people he 's ever met are in this book . There is Conroy 's own family , including abusive father , dying mother , and supportive siblings ; the lush locations from Rome to South Carolina 's coast ; and defining moments in time , from high school to the Holocaust to Vietnam . " Beach Music " is told in elegant prose : lyrical , overblown , romantic . ( Monitor Review 6/29/95 ) By Michele Ross <p> 8 . THE CELESTINE PROPHECY , by James Redfield , Warner , $ 17.95 <p> Well-intended but poorly written , the plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-help book . The hero is on a quest for a recently discovered Peruvian manuscript that details the progress of spirituality at the end of the 20th century . At different stages of the journey , he and his fellow searchers discover spiritual " insights , " nine in total . Rather than profound , the book is awash in cliches such as the need to " become conscious of the coincidences in our lives . " By Yvonne Zipp <p> 9 . Silent Night , by Mary Higgins Clark , Simon &; Schuster $ 15 <p> While an important part of the plot is a father recovering from cancer surgery , this little holiday heartwarmer is really about family and faith . When seven-year-old Brian chases down Fifth Avenue after the thief who unwittingly takes a St. Christopher medal meant for his father along with his mother 's wallet , he becomes a hostage in a prison break . A suspenseful turn of events makes it a page-turner , and its real appeal is how faith and love strengthen Brian and his family . By Terri Theiss <p> 10 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Schuster , $ 26 <p> The author of " Lonesome Dove " digs deep into the heart of Texas to deliver his readers the formative years of the heroes of his earlier book , which was made into the TV series . Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call join the Texas Rangers - the good cowboys - for an adventurous ride to Santa Fe , N.M . Along the way , they must fight off Indians and Mexican bandits . Many of the tales are unbelievable and reflect a romanticized and extremely violent view of how the West was won . Stupid ending . By Faye Bowers <p> 11 . A PLACE CALLED FREEDOM , by Ken Follett , Crown , $ 25 <p> Mack McAsh is a brawny and brilliant Scottish coal miner who smashes into the injustices of 18th century Britain and is almost smashed by them . He takes on greedy Highland mine owners and grimy London underworld bosses before emerging a free man on the far side of the Cumberland Gap in America 's wilderness . The story is a breeze to read , heavily seasoned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Characters are appealing , albeit a predictable plot . By Keith Henderson <p> 12 . FROM POTTER 'S FIELD , by Patricia Cornwell , Scribner , $ 24 <p> For first-time readers of Cornwell , this is not the best introduction to Richmond , Va . ' s Kay Scarpetta , mistress of murder , autopsies , and the morgue . But Cornwell fans will love it . Much of the book takes place in the New York City subways , and the plot can be as difficult for readers to navigate as those subways are for out-of-towners . Two weaknesses are lack of credibility for the decidedly evil antagonist and Scarpetta 's indecisiveness in her long-lasting affair with a married man . By Jim Bencivenga <p> 13 . POLITICALLY Correct Holiday Stories , by James Finn Garner , Macmillan $ 9.95 <p> If you think Santa is the king of capitalism , and believe Rudolph to be a crafty labor leader of the oppressed , then these PC holiday stories are for you . Garner revises five seasonal favorites by correcting plot , language , and character motivation for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may provide a short laugh or two . And they may see irony in a man who lives in a wood-heated home criticizing cutting down trees to decorate for Christmas . By Janet C. Moller <p> 14 . Memnoch the devil , by Anne Rice , Knopf , $ 25 <p> Well-written but with morbid overtones , Anne Rice 's fifth book in her series of vampire chronicles questions the very essence of Judeo-Christian religion . Garishly painting the novel with her pallette of blood , Rice challenges perceptions of God and the devil , heaven and hell . The novel is definitely not for the pious ( or squeamish ) , as it attempts to undermine traditional concepts of immortality . By Jim Bencivenga <p> 15 . STAR WARS : DARKSABER , by Kevin J. Anderson , Bantam , $ 22.95 <p> It seems that the Empire just wo n't die . In this latest installment of the epic saga , Luke , Leia , and now-husband Han , must help the New Republic defeat the evil Hutts before they reconstruct the Death Star . The novel stays true to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created in the ' 70s , but if you have n't read a few of the previous stories , you will probably be confused . A nice light read , but definitely wait to check it out from your local library . By Marianne Le Pelley
