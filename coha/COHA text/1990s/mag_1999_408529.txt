Popular Mechanics DESIGN &; ENGINEERING AWA R D 2000 // Honoring the best of the best . That 's the tradition of the POPULAR MECHANics Design &; Engineering Awards . Over the years , the Awards have become one of the most prestigious forms of recognition for achievement in engineering , design and innovation . And they 're our way of saluting the brightest people and smartest organizations who originated the best thinking of the year in the fields that we cover editorially  --  automobiles , home improvement , technology , outdoors and science . The most frequently asked question regarding the Awards is : How do you choose the winners ? Longtime readers know . There are literally no restrictions on nominating a candidate for an Award . Anyone can nominate anything for an Award . There are no categories and no set number of Awards . Entries are judged , and the winners chosen , by our editors-experts in their respective fields .

Past winners have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spin on the way you polish your car to the docking system used to link up the space shuttle Atlantis and the orbiting Russian Mir space station . This year 's winners run the gamut from a new spark plug to the world 's quickest production motorcycle , from a new class of drugs that work like none before to an adjustable wrench . All are significant and interesting in their cutting-edge creativity . Our POPULAR MECHANICS Design &; Engineering Award winners certainly rank among the greatest innovators of the year , and their winning entries simply are the best of 2000 .

While government emissions regulations have forced a move Photograph // to cleaner-running four-strokes , outboard manufacturers have tried to salvage their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carburetors for reduced emissions . But some manufacturers have run into other problems with their systems . Yamaha 's high-pressure direct injection ( HPDI ) system is clean burning and smooth running . In fact , it 's the centerpiece of an all-new two-stroke V6 engine in 150- and 200-hp versions that is fuel efficient , durable and reliable , Your favorite lake is now a no-smoking zone .

SOLO 470 LEAF BLOWER Solo Leaf blowers are a mixed blessing .

Designed as a backpack unit , this commercial piece of equipment takes the strain out of long work sessions by putting weight where it 's most comfortable-on your back . The air tube controls are also a big step up , with a cruise control button on the throttle and a swivel handle that takes the pressure off your wrist . But the big story with this unit is the noise reduction . It 's about half as noisy as its predecessor in the Solo line and already meets the new ANSI standard for low-noise blowers-the first unit to do so . It weighs only 20 pounds , runs for 2 hours on a tank of gas and moves 705 cu . ft. of air per minute . It 's a real feat to be considered a blowhard without making a lot of noise . STANLEY 85-610 MAXGRIP LOCKING ADJUSTABLE WRENCH Photograph Photograph // Stanley Tools Anyone who 's unthreaded a nut knows the value of an adjustable wrench . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an emergency repair of the family car . It 's a whole set of wrenches in one tool that fits in your pocket . Inches ? Millimeters ? Who cares ? One size fits all . The standard model , though , has one major drawback . If its jaws are n't adjusted right , even the most careful mechanic will take the corners off a hexnut if too much force is applied . Stanley 's solution is to leave the basic adjustable wrench design alone and simply add a locking feature that 's commonplace in locking pliers . It Photograph // can be adjusted to fit the sides of a hexhead nut or bolt in the traditional way , then the jaws are locked in place to provide a firm , nonslip grip . This tool is capable of exerting up to 300 pounds of force , making it useful for a wide range of materials and fittings . The result is a tool that makes you immediately wonder why no one ever thought of it before STERLING ADA-COMPLIANT TRANSFER SHOWER STALL Sterling Plumbing Sterling 's design for a basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense can take you . This 39-in. unit is great for new construction but in our view excels as a retrofit unit . It comes in four tongue-and-groove pieces made of durable solid Vikrell , a composite material that is compression molded . This shower can easily replace either a standard stall shower or a standard tub shower , with room to spare . The best part of the design is a substantial folding bench , with a stainless steel support structure , that locks in the down or up position . The stall also features wraparound stainless steel grab bars , a molded-in shelf along the back wall at the same height as the seat , and a low @/-in. - high threshold base for easy entry and exit . When the shower is outfitted with Photograph // a hose-mounted shower head , you can wash sitting down or standing up , an option everyone will love , regardless of physical condition . JOINT LAND ATTACK CRUISE MISSILE ELEVATED NETTED SENSOR ( JLENS ) U.S. Army Space And Missile Defense Command Raytheon JLENS will protect American forces from the greatest battlefield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first glance , it 's a modern variation of the spotting balloons used to direct Civil War artillery fire . But so much more sophisticated . The JLENS system puts long-range and attack radars on a pair of blimp-shaped helium- and airfilled structures that are connected to a mobile command post . When the 360 ' surveillance radar identifies a target that would otherwise be obscured by terrain , the attack radar directs a Patriot missile to engage the threat . Photograph // A simple but elegant solution to a problem that will plague battlefield commanders in decades to come . PASSIVE PERMANENT MAGNET BEARINGS Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory What may someday be regarded as one of the most significant mechanical devices of the 20th century , the passive permanent bearing could well make oil and ball bearings obsolete . The proof-of-concept model used to demonstrate the technology works with a mechanical bearing to reduce friction until the rotor has reached Photograph // a transition point . This occurs between a few hundred and a few thousand rpm . Then the repulsion force of the magnets causes the rotor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy costs by beating that old demon-friction . Ale predict that magnet bearings will be used in thousands of different applications in years to come . VITRAVENE Isis Pharmaceuticals Vitravene is the first of a new class of pharmaceuticals called 11 antisense " drugs that could change the practice of medicine as profoundly as did the introduction of antibiotics . These drugs work unlike any medicine ever created . Instead of attacking the bacteria or viruses that cause diseases , they literally throw a wrench into the portion of a cell 's genetic machinery that produces disease-related proteins . Antisense drugs are likely to be a new weapon in the war against cancer since it 's very likely they will be able to stop the cancer before it ever gestates in the body .
