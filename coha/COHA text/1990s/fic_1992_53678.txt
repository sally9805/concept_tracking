It was just me and my brother Paul at the coops when Hondo come home with his new truck , ready to kill . He 'd been down at Rose 's , drinking hard , and as he lurched across the lawn I stepped out in front of him like a fool . You see , me and Paul , we 're looking out for old Hondo . <p> " Where you goin ' ? " I says , and Hondo fakes to the right , but Paul 's there , and then to the left , but I 'm way ahead of him . Which was crazy , because then Hondo had nowhere to go but right through me , which he did , putting his knee in my stomach first . And Hondo is big  --  six six or something , and built like a bull 's backside . <p> " I 'm gon na kill that son of a bitch sold me that truck , " he says , " and that no-good wife of mine . " <p> I was bent over , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hondo goes through his door , two down from mine , and I seen there eighty acres and a whole life with it disappearing , like Hondo 's shoulders into the dark . <p> " We got ta do something , " I says to Paul . <p> " What ? " Paul says . <p> Paul 's one of those skinny guys , got no meat on his bones  --  a lightweight , and he 's been sick , too . Me , I 'm right in the middle . Paul looks at me and I look right back . Hondo 's rummaging around in his room for his rifle , busting everything up in the process , real noisy . Dark in there , since he knocked out all the lights . <p> " You just stand here , " I says to Paul , and he does , out front of Hondo 's door , his eyes all screwed up and worried . <p> There 's a maple tree , whirligigs in the grass , and Paul starts picking through for ones that 'll fly , easing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ruse , and I can see he 's figuring to bolt . <p> " Do n't move , " I says to Paul . <p> And all the while , Hondo 's banging off his walls , and we 're hoping maybe , like most times , that 'll be it . But no , here comes Hondo right out his door with his rifle , and me , all of a sudden I 'm on my hands and knees up beside the coops , thick grass and them bittersweet smelling dandelions everywhere . I do n't even know what I 'm looking for , when I 've got my hands on it , a two-by-four with a sheet of plastic stapled on top to cover the mower we pawned a few months back . <p> " Out of the way , Paul , " Hondo says . He 's swaying like a badly built bridge in a windstorm , and what does Paul do but start laughing . <p> Hondo 's got a real temper , and right there , his face goes all red . Three strikes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a divorce , and Paul laughing are just enough to put Hondo over the edge , and he raises his rifle a little , and it makes it all the easier for me to do what I had in mind to do  --  hit a home run , Hondo 's head being the ball . It made a sound like thwoking a big watermelon at the A &P,; and Hondo went right over into all them dandelions , face first . Paul stood staring , his mouth open like a trapdoor . <p> " Shut it , Paul , " I says , and he did , and we turned old Hondo over and made sure he was comfortable . <p> Dusk was coming on , the sky the color of a peach . It would have been nice sitting alongside old Hondo , but we were in trouble now , and had to act quick . We 'd been waiting , hoping things would straighten out themselves . Now , Old Mrs. Kern , from up the hill , would be over , and what were we going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that sunset and all , I got sidetracked . Me and Paul and Hondo , I was thinking . <p> We 'd all come to the coops together after Calmenson Paper laid us off . Cheapest rent around : rooms , sort of , in a cleaned-up chicken coop downwind from the old house . An outbuilding , that 's what it was , on a farm , the town built up around on all sides but the west . There , eighty acres of prime dirt stretched just about as far as the eye could see , and every last one Old Lady Kern 's People had been lusting after that land for some time . Old Lady Kern , they said , she 's got ta go sooner or later . <p> I looked west . Now I lusted , too . Rolling hills , all in clover , a river running through it , a couple high spots , brown-tipped , like nipples . I had a desire to run a plow up those old hills . Plant a few acres of corn . On the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maples , and down by the river , birch . It was like a vision , that cabin , smoke curling out the chimney , and those trees , leaves fluttering in the breeze and sounding like running water . <p> I ached for it , is what I 'm saying . <p> " Ruben , " Paul says . " What 're we gon na do ? " <p> I reeled myself back in . We had to act fast . <p> " Gim me a second , " I said . <p> The sky had gone a shade darker . We 'd have to get Hondo in soon for his big performance . The thought of it made me sick . Only , we did have one thing going for us : Mrs. Kern did n't come down nights until Hondo 's lights went on . And that gave me cause to chuckle . <p> Old Hondo 'd found Jesus a few months back , and lost his wife in the process . " I am the way and the light , " he 'd bellowed that week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gut hanging out , preaching off that elm stump . " You heathens , " he said  --  and he being Chippewa like Paul and me , all raised Mediwiwin , his saying it came as something of a shock- " repent and lay down in the life of the Lord . " <p> I reached under Hondo 's head and felt for the bump . He had a good-sized one ; I had n't wanted to hit him and not knock him out . <p> " Help me pull him into his room , " I said . <p> As I 'd suspected , Paul , sick as he was , was no help at all . You have no idea how heavy a body is until you try to move one  --  you see it all the time in murder mysteries and whatnot , and they just whisk the thing away . But no , Hondo , since he 'd been going to all those church meetings , basement potlucks , and devotional pizzas , had put on some weight . <p> " Jesus , " Paul said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hondo halfway to his door . <p> " You can say that again , " I said . , <p> I had Hondo under the arms , and thought I might herniate myself , trying to lift him like that , so I got down on the other end with Paul , and we pulled on those fancy boots of his , Red Wings , and he slid right across the grass there so nice we forgot to slow down and his head made that melon sound again when we pulled him over the stoop and into his room . <p> " Oops , " Paul said . <p> I checked to see Hondo was still breathing . Got down on my hands and knees . Breath you would n't believe . <p> " Okay , " I says . <p> Paul just stands there , his hands hanging at his sides like they do . He 's a little lacking in the mental department , see . Mercury , from up at Calmenson Paper , done it , only nobody listens . Methyl mercury . He was mixing paper in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming right up in his face . Mercury ? How ? they said . But who listens to a half-blood Chippewa ? It 's drink that done it , they said . <p> " Put your hands in your pockets , " I says . <p> But now Paul 's got the shakes coming on . I might have to knock him down and get his tongue out of his throat . All that exercise 's set him off and there go his eyes , rolling back , and goddamn if Mrs. Kern is n't lookin ' out her kitchen window , just waiting . <p> It 's dark in Hondo 's room , and I ca n't see . I got ta get something to pull Paul 's tongue out . <p> " Jesus ! " I say to myself , and Hondo grunts . <p> But here come Paul 's eyes , focusing on me , and he 's going to be all right . <p> " Siddown , " I say , taking Paul 's shoulder . <p> So we sit , the three of us in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back up against the stove , Paul in one ladder-back chair and me in another , waiting for Paul 's breathing to even out . It 's just too much , I think ; and then I pinch my thigh  --  real hard . Two big sins , if you ask me : self-pitying , and not giving the other guy a fair shake . So I stop the one and do the other . Still , it 's complicated and makes no sense . <p> There at Calmenson Paper , Paul starts shaking and having fits and his eyes roll back in his head . I go in to talk to the big cheese , Earl Carter , bring Paul with me , and Hondo for support . Hondo 's got his Bible tucked under his arm , is in that **25;89;TOOLONG phase ( one I went through years back myself ) . <p> " Your job there 's poisoning my brother , " I says . " Lookit him . He 's ruined already . " <p> Paul was in between fits . <p> Earl bridged his arms out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it buzzed . The office smelled of coffee I was thirsty . Earl shook his head . <p> " Ruben , " he says , " I 'm sick and tired of you Indians coming to work drunk and cryin ' sick . You hear me ? " <p> I said I did . I also said this was n't drinking . <p> " It 's like something I saw in a magazine , " I says . " Happened to a whole lot of Japanese people , got poisoned with mercury . " <p> Earl 's look got uglier . Right away I seen that went over real good with him , what I 'd just said . Earl had been in the Big War , in the Pacific . <p> I was stumped . <p> And then , right then , as if we 'd timed it or something , Paul 's eyes roll back in his head and he goes all spastic , flops down on Earl 's desk , coffee mug and papers flying . He 's going there like a windmill in a hurricane until Hondo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go after his tongue . In a minute it 's all over . <p> But Earl , he 's pissed . <p> " Get that . . . garbage out of my office , " he says . " All of you  --  " <p> And that 's when I gave him my armed services best , a fistful of U.S. of A. right in the mouth . Fired , all three of us . Right there , complete with police escort and a night in jail for me . Later , I called about severance pay . Earl said we 'd have to sue to collect . So we were out on our asses and broke , Paul sick , and Hondo with that new truck of his , sitting all shiny out front , the sun glaring off the hood so bad mornings we could hardly bear to drive it . <p> In the unemployment office , Paul 's okay , but as soon as we 're looking for work , sure enough , he gets to breathing hard for nervousness , and there he goes , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell . And like in that old handbasket , away we go , right down the ladder , one rung at a time , and end up living in these outbuildings , dirt floor and all  --  I mean , we 'd really hit bottom . And as a last slap in the face , the cowboy who sold Hondo the truck did n't mention the sawdust he put in the crankcase so the rods would n't rattle and now they do . That engine sounds like a bunch of spray cans with those beads in the bottom all shaking . A real case of terminal rod-knock . Seventeen hundred bucks worth of truck up in smoke , and half of it mine . <p> That 's what I was thinking , sitting there in the dark . That , and I was saying a little prayer . Do n't mistake me . I 'm no believer in visions and voices , and I 'm no saint . But something in me wo n't let go of that , and right there , I got to mumbling to myself , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looked at my chair , sitting empty . And out of nowhere , I think , That 's it ! <p> I went down to my room at the end of the coops , got two bulbs , come back , and put them in Hondo 's sockets , but did n't turn them on . It was pitch black , the sun gone down , and the crickets chirring . <p> " Paul , " I says , " help me get ol " Hondo here up into this chair . " <p> We were short on time and I rushed things . I hoped Paul did n't have another seizure . His face was still a little blue . We got Hondo into the chair , and I held him by the shoulder . <p> " You hold him now , Paul , " I said , and went out to Hondo 's truck for the tow rope . <p> I wrapped that bristly rope around Hondo three or four times . Set the other chair across from him . Put out the checkers and board . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he had to get sick , right on the table and everything . Then it was into the shower for Lysol , scrubbing the board and the table clean . I was desperate . Everything we were working towards , hoping for , would be done and gone if Old Mrs. Kern so much as caught a whiff of Hondo 's breath . So I just tilted Hondo 's head back and gargled him a bit with that Lysol . It must have burned something awful , because ol ' Hondo sat right up , his eyes wide . He flapped his arms at his sides and started shouting . <p> " Jee-sus Kee-riste ! " he shouts . <p> And just as quick he slumps over again . <p> I pulled back one of Hondo 's curtains . Old Mrs. Kern was still waiting there , though by the door now . The moon was coming out , and the room was flooded with silver light . The place smelled like a hospital . <p> " Paul , " I said , " go back to your room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , " I says . <p> But Paul wo n't budge . He gets scared when he has seizures , and I ca n't blame him . He gets this bright look on his face , slips into Hondo 's bed , pulls the covers up under his chin , smiles that ruined smile of his , and I think , What the hell . <p> I set a stool behind Hondo , made sure I could fit between him and the wall , and reached for the light switch . <p> She took her time getting down to the coops , I can tell you that much . Hondo settled into his chair , and then he reached back and ran his fingers up and down my scalp and mumbled Annabelle , oh Annabelle and Patty , and Susan , none of which was the name of his wife . I pinched him , and he just grinned and started all over again . Until I used the corkscrew in my jackknife . Finally , there was the rattle of Mrs. Kern at the door , and I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nin " imitating Hondo 's drawl . ' <p> The bulbs I 'd gotten from my unit were forties , and between the room being dim and Mrs. Kern 's already bad eyes , cataracts like marbles under bottle-bottom lenses , she had to feel her way to sit . She squeezed between chair and table , round as an apple , smiled , dumplings under her chin . I noticed she 'd forgotten to shave her mustache . <p> " Oh-kay ? " she says , adjusting her hearing aid . There 's a big dial on the front , like on a radio , and she turns it this way and that , then messes with her necklace . " You vant you should start ? " <p> I grunted affirmation , and reached out from behind Hondo and moved my first checker . Tonight Hondo was red . <p> " Zo , " she says , countering my move , " I tell you a-bout hahs-bahnd in old country . " <p> I do n't know what kind of checker player Hondo was , but Mrs. Kern was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse , as I 've already shown , I 've got a mean temper , and am a poor loser . I hate to lose so much I usually do n't play at all . Pride , I suppose . They were unable to beat it out of me at that reservation school . I 'm a big sinner in that category . <p> So there I am . I turn my head a second to check on Paul , and what does Old Lady Kern do but snap on a king , just a Hash out of the corner of my eye . And when I 'm looking at her again , she sits , back straight , all quiet and honest . And she is , I suppose , but for checkers . <p> " Vell , Homer , " she says . <p> Homer ? We had n't called Hondo that since we were kids and playing baseball and he 'd knocked one ball after another into the creek past the outfield . <p> " Yah ? " I says , pulling on Hondo 's braids so his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Checkers . I was giving her a run for her money , but I got the feeling , from the sour look on her face , that I 'd better just go ahead and let her wipe the board with me . Only , somehow , I could n't . <p> " I zee playing you vell too-night , " Mrs. Kern said . <p> I raised Hondo 's right hand , a gesture of humility . I was thinking proud thoughts . <p> And then she kinged me . <p> Cheater . <p> I wanted that game over . Then the next , and the one after that . She told me about her daughter , Liza , and her son , Cojneck , and her three husbands . Coal miners , each dead of black lung before thirty , her son and daughter killed in the war . <p> " It vas good tiny I marry young , " she said . " I caught them up to . Quick , " she said , holding up her index finger . " And den , Valter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a palm to her cheek , and those big old blinded-up eyes of hers got all the more rheumy-looking . I thought she might cry . Out of the blue , Hondo stirred He reached for my hair . <p> " Patty , " he said . " Oh , Patty . " <p> I got my hands around his throat , tried to cut him back a bit . <p> " Vhat ? " Mrs. Kern said . " Vhat ? " <p> " Pretty , " I said . " fret-tee . " <p> Mrs. Kern fingered her necklace . About two pounds of fake pearls . " Bee-u-tee-ful , " she says , proudly . " All real lan-atic pearl . From Valter . " <p> Her eyes behind those bottle-bottom lenses got all glassy again . I just let her sit . <p> I was in pain , waiting . My guts rumbled , not having eaten well lately , and the stool was hard and cold , a metal one Hondo 'd taken from Calmenson Paper the day we 'd been fired . Looking around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calmenson Modern : metal bookshelves , file cases with a fancy cover , the table , curtains with ocean liners sailing proudly across . <p> Paul turned in Hondo 's bed . I reached into my pocket and rubbed my cedar-bark charm . I wondered , as I sometimes did , if maybe the two things , this prayerin ' , and the charms I made , did n't work against each other and maybe I should go with just one or the other . And all the while , Old Mrs. Kern is way inside herself across the table , tears in her eyes . I could cry , too , I think , angry-like , and right there I get this impulse to slap Old Mrs. Kern alongside the head , but where it really comes from is jealousy . <p> You see , I ca n't cry . And what good would it do if I did ? I was thinking , sitting there mad enough to spit tacks , Would it help me with Paul ? Put bread on the table ? Get me a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us Indians our land back ? And somehow it always comes to that last thing , so while Old Mrs. Kern is indulging herself , I think about it : <p> Land . <p> It 's like air to us Chippewa . Only , we lost ours . All parceled out on paper , in a language with lots of wheretofores and whatnot , such that most whites do n't even understand it . A bunch of them bought farms on Chippewa reserves not knowing any better , or not caring . Threw up barns and outbuildings like so many mushrooms Walter Kern was one of them : stole his farm with a bottle of whiske'y and a few blankets . <p> I 'd heard about it from my mother : Chingus ! she spat  --  weasel . Living there , I 'd given it some thought . <p> So when Hondo told me Old Mrs. Kern was talking putting him on permanent  --  and that 's the word she used , permanent  --  I was all ears . Tell me more , I said , and he did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her will , " he said , and while he talked on , I had that dream : <p> The cabin with the smoke curling out , Paul on a brick-red tractor , puttering along . We could handle that . Corn . Eighty acres , blowin ' in the breeze , and in June lightning bugs , blinking all over it . <p> " She catches me drinkin ' , though , " Hondo said , " and she wo n't consider it . Says I got to prove myself . ' I got Jesus , ' I told her . " <p> God help us all , I thought . <p> The table shook , and I startled . <p> " Your move , " Old Mrs. Kern says . <p> I 'd forgotten about the board . There were more kings now than we had playing pieces ; which is to say , she 'd brought a few of her own . They were n't even the same black , exactly . More of a deep charcoal , but she 'd gotten them underneath . <p> So what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Kern sitting across the table . She would n't want a dummy running her farm , or a hothead , or somebody who 'd fight with her , I knew that . And the funny thing was , Hondo , if he 'd been losing bad as I was , he 'd 've thrown the board , sent the pieces over hell and back . Or , he 'd 've punched somebody . <p> " Gim me a second , " I says in a gruff voice . <p> I just could n't figure it . I 'd looked through the window one night , both of them there at the table looking gloomy . Hondo reaches across the checkers and puts his hand on Old Mrs. Kern 's forearm , and she busted down and cried . <p> " Valter , " she says , and Hondo 'd replied , " We all got to lose things sometimes . " <p> Now I looked at her across the table , straight on . She blinked behind those glasses , her eyes more like porpoises ' eyes I seen at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shining blind like aluminum foil . She had on this old gingham dress , washed to rags . She looked pretty tired . I thought about my mother , Papagine , and how big she 'd got there at the end . Bad diet , lots of salt pork and white flour . Something shook in me and I swallowed , something not quite bitter , but to my taste pretty awful . I choked it down . <p> " All right , " I says . " You win . " <p> And right there , Old Mrs. Kern 's head hit the table . Fallen dead asleep . Broke the dial on her hearing aid , and when she roused , me pulling from behind , she set up a-shouting at first , until she felt for that box on her chest and seen it was broken . <p> " Broke , " I said . " Broke ! " <p> I shut off the lights , stood holding her in the dark , then thought just to put her in Hondo 's bed . After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . So I half drag , half guide her over into the corner and set her down . I pull back the blanket , and get a fistful of blood hammering in my head . But Old Mrs. Kern 's already swinging her legs in and there 's no turning back . <p> " Mrs. Kern , " I says , and getting nothing in return , I think she 's out . <p> Both of them . <p> I went back to the table , and in the dark , swept the board and checkers into the box . It 's real quiet there , and all of a sudden I realize Paul 's quit snoring . <p> " Oh . . . oh my , " Old Mrs. Kern says . " Oh . . . my . . . goodness ! " <p> I slipped out the door and sat on that elm stump , the sky clear and inviting and dark ; it just went on and on . Paul had always been a shy one , and had n't ever had any luck with girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the door and went up the hill to her house . I could n't tell whether it was a spring in her step , or anger that propelled her . She did n't stop by Hondo 's the night after , or the night after that , but when she did , she came with a short , pock-faced man wearing a dark suit and hat . John Law , I thought , watching them cross the yard and go into Hondo 's unit . <p> I worried . I could just taste that cellblock . <p> I 'd told Paul the day after he 'd been with a girl he 'd had his eye on , Evelynn Jackson . It did n't matter that neither of us had seen Evelynn in over a year . Paul was that addled . <p> I paced . <p> I 'd take responsibility myself , I thought , if it came to that ; but could Hondo take care of Paul ? I doubted it . Time crawled by . Paul was scared , too , just watching me , and had one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top of him so he would n't hurt himself . His tongue got way back down his throat and I had to use the handle of my spatula to get him breathing . We got all messed up there . , <p> " Okay , buddy ? " I said when he 'd calmed down <p> He nodded and slid up against my bed . Somebody knocked on the door , and for a second , I could n't force myself up to open it . I says a little prayer and stood . <p> " Ruben , " Hondo says , " open the goddamned door . I got somethin ' to show ye . " <p> I threw back the bolt . Hondo stepped in beaming from ear to ear . <p> " It 's a goddamned miracle , " he says , shaking a sheaf of papers . <p> I dropped down to that dirt floor . <p> " Ruben , " Hondo says , shaking me . " Ruben ! " <p> But I ca n't see to stand , digging and filling my mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson <p>
