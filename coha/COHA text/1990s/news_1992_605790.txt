<p> Last year began with newly elected D.C. Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly questioning the way things had been done at City Hall and promising dramatic changes . <p> It ended with a disillusioned mayor facing questions about her agenda and style and about whether much , if anything , had improved . <p> Now the woman who once saw herself as a one-term reformer is positioning herself for a possible run for another term and is trying to embrace more closely a government and a city that still really do n't know her . <p> Her biggest mistake so far , Kelly said , was viewing the entire political system in the city as evil and trying desperately to distance herself from the powers that be . Another mistake , she said , was believing she could retool the bureaucracy overnight . <p> " I 'm just as committed to cleaning house , dramatic reform of the government and . . . maybe what I have learned to do is roll with the flow of those obstacles better . I was so set upon effecting change and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best of you , you can get co-opted by it . . . . Now I 'm absolutely comfortable that I wo n't be . " <p> Her great confidence , however , is not shared by community activists , business leaders and career politicians who have expressed dissatisfaction with this fiery , fist-pounding executive . Some say she is aloof , inaccessible , insensitive and lacking concrete ideas for creating jobs , improving services and ending the bloodshed in city streets . <p> The mayor is aware of the discontent . As she puts it , some of the people who helped sweep a political outsider into office have gone from believing she could walk on water to wondering whether she can swim . <p> " We ca n't make any excuses for Kelly , " said Terry Lynch , executive director of the Downtown Cluster of Congregations and a supporter of the new mayor . " She ran for mayor . She became mayor . But she was n't ready . Winning took her and her campaign by surprise . " <p> Political observers offer a simple explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripple : They call it a " reality check . " <p> " She went from running against the government to running the government itself , and that 's a big switch , " said American University Law School professor Jamin Raskin , who specializes in studying local governments . " The problem for Kelly is that she was never there during the fat years . She 's presiding over austerity during the lean years , and that 's a tough position for her to be in . " <p> Kelly was dissatisfied herself with the first year . She was naive , she said , to think she could reform the government overnight . For her , 1991 was an education in how volatile , unpredictable and unyielding politics can be . " I mean , it was just overwhelming to have to walk in the first day and literally deal with budgets , literally announce what it is you 're going to do , " Kelly said . " I mean , that 's overwhelming . <p> " You 're brand-new to the bureaucracy . You 're dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you have no relationship with , and the government is literally sinking . Some of it due to recession . Some of it due to neglect  --  clear , visible , blatant neglect . " <p> Her first year in office was marked by a disturbance in Mount Pleasant , disarray in her Cabinet , an unfulfilled pledge to get rid of all of former mayor Marion Barry 's political appointees , a layoff plan that has yet to deliver as promised , a record number of homicides in the District , and bickering with the D.C. Council . <p> Yet , Kelly attributes the criticism to understandable impatience and predictable sour grapes . <p> " I think a lot of the old guard that everybody 's accustomed to going to for opinions may feel a little disoriented because they had nothing to do with the person who won , " she said . " And I think , to a certain extent , there 's going to be a level of discomfort for a while . " <p> But Kelly caused some of that discomfort , political observers said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals with . <p> For example , when a community in Ward 3 invited the mayor to a meeting to voice objections and offer alternatives to her plan to put a 50-bed shelter for the homeless there , Kelly told residents that her mind was made up and she would n't budge . <p> The cheers that once greeted her turned into boos . But she insisted that the affluent Northwest community " step up to the plate " and help the " have-nots . " <p> And then there was the city contracting dispute with the council . Council Chairman John A. Wilson , upon learning through the media last summer that Kelly had awarded more than $ 50 million in contracts without council approval , sought a court order to halt the practice . That failed , and Wilson later dropped the lawsuit in the hope of reaching a compromise with Kelly . <p> But the mayor rejected council offers to share contracting authority and successfully sued to get the right to award contracts without council oversight . The council has appealed . <p> Council member William P. Lightfoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a relationship based on " constructive tension . . . . It 's not personal acrimony , it 's disputes over policies and the movement of the government . " <p> The mayor takes a harder line : " You ca n't sit up and argue and plead with people to think differently . You 've just got to make it happen . " <p> But little has happened to change District residents ' lives , some political observers say . <p> " If you look at it long term , she had a good year " in getting the city 's finances in order and improving relations with Congress , said Pedro Alfonso , a member of the D.C. Chamber of Commerce and the Washington Board of Trade . " But now it 's time to look at some of the more pressing problems , such as crime . " <p> The mayor did score some victories last year , but there was little time for celebration . She won financial concessions from Congress early in her term to keep the city afloat and , in what she and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its annual federal payment to the city . <p> " I can think of some of the people who pick at me now are the same ones who laughed when we said we 're going to go to Congress and get $ 100 million , " she said . <p> She has begun this year , however , grappling with a $ 223 million budget deficit . She is struggling to identify services , programs and up to 3,500 union jobs that might be cut to close the gap for this fiscal year , which ends Sept. 30 . Some labor leaders have accused her of reneging on a promise not to fire rank-and-file workers . <p> But the mayor said she has her " back up against the wall " and has no choice but to cut into a labor force that eats up more than half the District 's $ 3.5 billion budget . <p> She said her budget , to be presented Feb. 7 , will reflect her priorities : maintaining programs and services for senior citizens and devoting more resources to youth . And she is restoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer jobs . <p> Her $ 20 million comprehensive plan announced in November to tackle youth violence raised hopes for Kelly at a time when a recent poll showed her popularity was lower among black residents than among whites . She hopes that half the money will come from federal grants , and the rest from the city coffers . <p> " Right now , being the mayor of a big city is an impossible job because the problems are intractable and the money 's not there , " said Louis Seidman , of Georgetown University Law School . " There 's not enough money in the public sector and everybody 's moving to the suburbs . " <p> However , Kelly is still clinging to her grand vision for the city : She wants to close the gap between the poor and the wealthy , by creating more business opportunities for blacks and Hispanics and by luring more minority entrepreneurs . <p> For example , her negotiation with Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke to build a new stadium includes a fight to ensure that 35 percent of the contracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jobs go to District residents . A deal is expected soon . <p> One cornerstone of her economic development plan is to turn the city into a mini-Hollywood by attracting the sports and entertainment industry . Critics said the local economy , hemorrhaging jobs and businesses , needs more immediate treatment . <p> Inside the government , Kelly has struggled to get her Cabinet in place . She finally installed the last member , the director of the Department of Housing and Community Development , last week . But she has had turnover in the crucial posts of city administrator and chief of staff . <p> The ever-changing cast , and even the mayor 's decision to change her last name from Dixon to Kelly when she got married last month , suggest that " she has not yet found the voice and the mindset of her administration , " Raskin said . " It contributed to a sense of flux and instability . " <p> The mayor said she has now learned that she needs to reach out more to people and to be more accessible and flexible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 State of the City speech to try to get closer to constituents  --  and to raise $ 250,000 . <p> Now , with a better understanding of the basic work needed before changes can begin , she said : " I think having made the investment thus far , and given what I think can be done . . . I 'm more inclined that I would want to seek reelection . " <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> CHECK WITH NEWS ART FOR GRAPHIC <p> <p> <p> <p>
