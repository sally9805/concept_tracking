<p> ' MADE IN <p> THE U.S.A. ' <p> Editor  --  This Christmas , I became more acutely aware than ever before of just how many goods are manufactured in foreign countries  --  the scarf I received was made in China ; a Ladybug hand-puppet was from Korea ; a set of dumbbells " made in Taiwan , " and , of course , the majority of holiday ornaments and decorations come from those countries . My " real " Christmas tree was one of very few things " Made in the U.S.A. " <p> My after-Christmas shopping further opened my eyes : at one of the three most elegant stores at Stanford Shopping Center , every sweater , jumpsuit , dress , jacket , nightgown or PJ 's that I looked at had labels denoting that all were made in Asian countries . And , of course , most of our shoes are now made in Brazil or other foreign countries . <p> If all these things ( plus electronics and of course , automobiles and/or auto parts ) continue being manufactured by workers outside the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast U.S. population who will be retiring in future years ? I just read that our population increased 2.7 million in 1990 . Will our grandchildren even have Social Security ? ? <p> I want to see more " made in the U.S.A. " labels , or I 'm going to start knitting my own sweaters , and I 'll get along fine with my 30-year-old American-made toaster . <p> BETH PFORR <p> Los Altos <p> . <p> THE BIG THREE 'S PLIGHT <p> Editor  --  In the late ' 70s , the Big Three auto executives persuaded the Carter administration to implement protectionist trade policies on Japanese auto exports to the United States . Specifically , import quotas on the unit volume of passenger cars were imposed . In response , Japan made two fundamental strategic changes in its approach to the U.S. market : First , they introduced higher- priced , quality luxury and sports models , allowing growth of dollar sales while forced to limit unit volume . Second , they aggressively pursued the U.S. truck market , since the quotas applied only to cars . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The long-term results of trade restrictions were inevitable . A decade later , we are now surrounded by Toyota trucks , Honda Accords and quality , expensive models such at those from Lexus , Infinity and Acura which now invade all segments of the auto industry , including Detroit 's historical oligopolies in luxury , sports and truck models , all because Detroit complained Japan was shipping too many $ 7,000 Honda Civics in the ' 70s ! Mr. Iacocca and his fellow buffoons virtually invited Japan into their own backyard . <p> But Big Three 's cries of foul play against Japan are virtually identical today to those of the late ' 70s . Their current demand for more protectionism is as unwise and misguided as it was then . Their management should simply look to the mirror for the cause of their failures . They surround themselves with puppet boards of directors , " golden parachutes " and an abundance of excuses to disguise their incompetence . The solution to their ills : new , competent and customer-oriented management , a focus on real quality , and state-of-the-art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOLT <p> Portola Valley ( San Mateo County ) <p> . <p> LEADERS WE DESERVE <p> Editor  --  The absurd sight of George Bush being dragged out from underneath his dining table in Tokyo reminds me of what a ridiculous president he is . Here is a president who is generally ignorant . He scares us with the idea of President Quayle . He refuses to acknowledge AIDS as a public health crisis , but instead talks about behavior . He waged a pointless war to prove he is n't a wimp and has allowed the U.S. economy to sink to a point that will take years to resolve . Although I live in America I am not a citizen , therefore I can not vote . I just have to remain shocked at the politicians such as Bush and Governor Wilson . But to those who can vote there is a saying  --  you get what you deserve . <p> JOHN R. WARDMAN <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> BLAMING THE POOR <p> Editor  --  Governor Wilson 's attack on welfare will not balance the state budget but it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reductions will save only a fraction of the amount needed to eliminate California 's deficit , but they will have a devastating impact on the poorest children in the state . Wilson 's statements that he wants to help children through spending on education and preventative health programs is nothing short of cynical : a marginal increase in spending on health and education will do little to help a child made homeless by the drastic reductions in welfare benefits . <p> Wilson 's skillful campaign of misinformation is intended to blame the poor for hard times . Contrary to the governor 's stereotyping , the vast majority of welfare recipients have only 1 or 2 children . The increase in the monthly welfare grant for additional children is so small that it provides no incentive to have larger families . Wilson 's claim that welfare recipients are drawn to California by higher benefits is also fabricated . California 's non-partisan legislative analyst has concluded that there is no factual support for this " welfare magnet " theory . <p> The choice is not , as Wilson puts it , between education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic human services . <p> Wilson 's attack on services for children , the elderly and disabled is nothing more than an attempt to divert attention from the more complicated problems of a neglected economy while preserving the privileges of his wealthier supporters . <p> VERONIKA KOT <p> Oakland <p> . <p> TIMBER PROPAGANDA <p> Editor  --  The letter from John Ponce of Alta California Alliance ( Chronicle , January 6 ) was titled " North Coast Viewpoint , " but " Timber Industry Propaganda " would have been more appropriate . Mr. Ponce 's views are certainly not held by the majority of residents here . <p> The first platitude parroted by Mr. Ponce is that the devastation and catastrophes which have occurred to the land are " acts of God . " In fact , there is abundant scientific evidence that man 's mismanagement of the land is directly responsible for the devastation we now witness . <p> After the 1964 flood , Redwood Creek , near Orick , was buried in sediment . The U.S.G.S. determined that the amount of erosion was seven times greater than had occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coincidentally , during the 20 years preceding the flood , 70 percent of the watershed had been logged . Thousands of miles of stream habitat have been destroyed by an industry which , according to Mr. Ponce , " understands and loves the land and its creatures . " <p> Many of our formerly productive salmon and steelhead streams are simply buried in soil that washed off clear-cut hills . Once the soil is lost , the usefulness of the land for growing more timber is diminished . The loss to ecosystems and to our economy can not be calculated , but it is enormous . And yet , timber companies continue to take even more trees from these already ravaged watersheds . <p> I can agree with Mr. Ponce on one point : our community has definitely been destabilized . Both our major industries , salmon fishing and timber harvest , are on the verge of collapse . For this , we can thank the timber industry 's arrogance and refusal to acknowledge scientific findings . California 's Department of Forestry has warned that over-cutting , not regulations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Jerry Partain , former CDF director and staunch supporter of the industry , admitted that environmentalists , loggers and foresters who have been sounding the warning bell are correct in saying that dwindling timber supply caused by the high rate of cutting would force drastic cuts in company operations within a few years . <p> It is indeed a tragedy that the spotted owl , marbled murrelet , and many runs of salmon and steelhead have been driven to the brink of extinction . It 's also a tragedy that so many hard working people will soon be getting the shaft from an industry that blatantly implements " cut and run " policies , and clearly cares nothing for the well being of North Coast residents or ecosystems . The timber industry has manipulated these people , who are commendably loyal but largely ignorant , into believing that environmentalists are the source of all their problems . Having diverted attention from themselves , the industry continues to maximize short-term profits . While they profit , the rest of California has suffered great losses of public trust resources such as clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humboldt County ) <p> . <p> NOT SO INDIGENOUS <p> Editor  --  Indigenous Peoples Day in Berkeley ? Does n't that learned city know that there are no peoples indigenous to the Americas , humans having originated in Africa and migrated here over a land bridge from Asia ? For that matter , murder , plunder and disease were quite well established before the Europeans arrived . <p> MARGE SHERPY <p> El Cerrito
