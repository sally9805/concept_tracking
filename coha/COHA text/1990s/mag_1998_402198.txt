Men . They inspire US , tickle us , turn us on-and sometimes cut us to the quick . We take the good with the bad but remember the scars far longer than we do the kisses . Praise ? Many of us spritz it on our men lightly like special occasion cologne , more often allowing our admiration to glow silently in our hearts . But if we unsealed our lips , how could we not testify that our men have always moved us in myriad ways ? From Malcolm X to Martin Luther King , Jr. , to Thurgood Marshall . From Bill Cosby to Richard Pryor to Denzel Washington . Then there are our fathers , brothers , lovers and friends , whose names never make the news and those in between-our new generation of leaders and artists . So we take the time and space here to speak up abotil some of those brothers who by word or deed , have stirred us of late . They make us strive , think , laugh , sweat and sometimes even cringe . U.S. SURGEON GENERAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the 1930 's Thomas Parran , then the nation 's top doc , was nearly pink-slipped for mentioning the word syphilis , and in 1994 Dr. Joycelyn Elders faced the firing squad for daring to discuss masturbation . Enter cool-tempered David Satcher , MD. , the first nominee to clear the political hurdle in more than three years . Of course , he speaks out against smoking and drug use , but astutely adds violence to the list of preventable health problems . A former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Satcher , 57 ( below ) , has always embraced causes near and dear to us : He 's an expert on sickle cell anemia , once headed historically Black Meharry Medical College and is credited with inspiring President Clinton to apologize for the notorious 40-year Tuskegee syphilis experiment . Today he 's bent on eliminating racial disparities when it comes to disease . So let 's all toast his good health ! JOHN W. BOYD , JR . ' S MULE is still kicking , but his 200 acres are in jeopardy A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is president of the National Black Farmers Association . It 's more of a calling than a job , as he fights to ensure that his members ' tractors roll into the year 2000 and well beyond . For decades , however , government loans to rescue farmers in trouble have mostly ended up in the hands of Whites , while Blacks often faced foreclosure . " Congress puts laws in to protect the rockfish and the bald eagle , " Boyd scoffs , " and they ca n't do anything to protect our heritage ? " Hundreds of Black farmers are currently suing the government , which has admitted discriminating against them . Meanwhile , they 're losing land at an estimated 9,000 acres a week . And while in 192014 percent of all farmers were Black , that number had dwindled to 1 percent by 1997 . A determined Boyd has traveled the nation to demand fairness for our farmers and to protect our roots , which reach 400 years deep into this country 's soil . THE BLESSINGS OF THE FATHER were visited upon the son : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day long . But while Jesse Jackson , Sr. , has mostly worked outside the system , demanding that it throw open its doors to us , Jesse Jackson , Jr. , has stepped through to represent Illinois 's Second District in the U.S. House of Representatives . Jackson ( left ) , a 33-year-old Democrat who has the ear of Republicans as well , leads a constituency that includes Blacks and Whites and Chicago 's " hood as well as its " burbs . He stays on the case , not missing a congressional vote in more than two years . " My grandparents , who struggled for the right to vote , and many of my ancestors , who never had the right to vote-I am the substance of the things they hoped for , " he explains . Elected Sexiest Politician by People magazine last year , the savvy legislator inherited his father 's charisma too . " The upside for this guy is the moon , " one political observer said of Jackson . " I mean , it 's unlimited . " PICK AN EDGY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relevance of the NAACP or even the spin on gangsta rap , and it 's a good bet that Michael Eric Dyson has been thinking about it His incisive analysis fills his books , including Reflecting Black : African-American Cultural Criticism ( University of Minnesota Press , $19.95 ) , Race Rules ( Vintage Books , $12 ) and Between God and Gangsta Rap ( Oxford University Press , $14.95 ) . A Baptist minister and professor at New York 's Columbia University , Dyson , 40 , seems as comfortable probing the souls of Black folks as he is with examining his own . " I am no stranger to young , angry Black males , " he once observed . " I was one , and depending on who 's consulted , I 'm still considered in the running . " AS THE HOST OF BET TONIGHT , Tavis Smiley trains his discerning eye on issues of interest to Black America . Tonight he may be interviewing President Clinton , tomorrow a troupe of rappers . Smiley , 34 , who lends his commentary to the popular Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also an advocate for our people : He challenged a major radio and TV advertising representative over a racist memo , got Christie 's auction house to cancel its sale of slave documents and regularly takes on tough topics in books such as Hard Left : Straight Talk About the Wrongs of the Right ( Anchor/Doubleday , $17.95 ) . Sometimes all the talk and travel leave Smiley , who is working on his fourth book , longing for slumber . But he says he rests easy at night when he knows he has " entertained , enlightened , encouraged and empowered " someone during the course of his day . THE BRILLIANCE OF HENRY LOUIS GATES , JR. , is not solely what he thinks but also his power to transform ideas into action . The chairman of Harvard University 's Afro-American Studies Department has attracted world-class scholars , legions of students and millions of dollars to what was once an ailing program . A prolific author himself ( Colored People Knopf , $25 , Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Black Man Vintage Books , $12 ) , Gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue long-lost African and AfricanAmerican texts . Closer to home , he 's breathing life into the dream of WE.B . Du Bois , Harvard 's first Black Ph.D . scholar , by completing an encyclopedia that chronicles the history and culture of Africa and people of African descent . Perhaps Gates 's most celebrated feat has been attracting other great minds , such as Cornel West and , more recently , Lani Guinier , to Harvard . Some complain that all that cogitating up at Harvard ai n't gon na benefit the average brother or sister on the street . Gates is not having it . " My whole life , " he says , " is a commitment to the Black community . " NO DOUBT TITO WOOTEN can play some football . What else could persuade the New York Giants to renew his contract last February , despite the fact that two months earlier the star defensive back faced charges that he choked , beat and bloodied his 22-year-old girlfriend , Akina Wilson ? When Wilson and Wooten , now 26 , went before the judge , Wooten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drop the charges . That 's when the judge instructed them to be " careful not to cause any similar conduct , " then urged Wooten to " have a good game . " A month later Wilson killed herself . The alleged Wilson attack was n't Wooten 's first offense . He was arrested twice before on charges of assaulting women . Word is teammates nicknamed him Thug Life . Some giant . THE REVEREND HENRY LYONS is virtually preaching to the choir these days . Attendance in his St. Petersburg , Florida , church has reportedly fallen off so much that he forbade Time magazine to take a picture of his sparsely filled Bethel Metropolitan Baptist Church earlier this year . Lyons heads the powerful National Baptist Convention USA , even though he has been indicted on several charges , including embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars from the organization . His name became front-page news more than a year ago when his wife , Deborah , set fire to a $700,000 mansion that Lyons had purchased with his " friend " and convention consultant Bernice Edwards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condo in Lake Tahoe , Nevada , with convention funds . And he has been cited as pocketing most of a contribution to help rebuild burned Black southern churches . Still , a majority of convention members voted to keep him as president . So it will be in a trial next year that the man some call the Black pope faces judgment day . LUTHER LUKE " CAMPBELL is still bringing women to their knees , whether it 's to pour bubbly from one sister 's cleavage to her crotch , catching it in a champagne glass or , as he boasts on his albums , to poke about like an eager yard dog . Our singers have always dabbled in sexy material , from blues singer Bessie Smith to Marvin Gaye . But they explored it with imagination , often in the context of love and equality . Campbell 's bump and grind seems to work best when women are put in compromised positions . Of course , it 's his right to talk trash , as a federal appeals court ruled six years ago . ( Remember Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , As Nasty As They Wan na Be , was declared legally obscene ? ) In recent years , the father of four has expanded his scuz into films and pay-per-view , further polluting an environment where Black love is struggling to survive . IF YOU THINK YOU SEE JAMIE Foxx at the unemployment office , get your eyes checked . Whether it 's his star turn on TV 's The Jamie Foxx Show , roles in half a dozen movies or writing producing and singing on his own album , Peep This , Foxx ( right ) keeps a job . It has been almost ten years since In Living Color debuted . But people still remember his portrayal of Wanda the masseuse , who , falling far short of a jet bathing-suit beauty , is rejected by every man she puts her hands on . And like Wanda , people still say " ret-ta-go " and " rock your world . " Then there was Foxx as Bunz , in Booty Call , who did impersonations of wellknown figures while nabbing nookie . Foxx can play the sensitive type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and The Truth About Cats and Dogs . The comedian once said of his prefame days that folks back home in Terrell , Texas , tried to sell him on a good job at the Kodak plant . Good thing he snapped . CHRIS TUCKER 'S MANIC ENERGY , high voice and buck-wild antics tend to zap you somewhere between your shock zone and your funny bone . A few years ago he was one of a million stand-up comics . But Hollywood acquired a taste for his ribald flair , especially after his role in the movie Friday . In it , he starred opposite Ice Cube as a trifling reefer dealer , smoking up the product , dodging bullets and trying to do the hump dance with neighborhood girls . In the futuristic flick The Fifth Element , he stalked the world as radio host Ruby Rhod , a sexy gender bender who made women jiggy in the knees . More recently , Tucker ( below ) , 25 , upped his game , starring , cowriting and serving as executive producer of the action comedy Money Talks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cowrote the script for Double-O-Soul and is set to produce it and mug with Mariah Carey . DAVE CHAPPELLE IS A SELF-PROCLAIMED racism connoisseur . Nothing like southern-style bigotry , the comedian says , as if he has just had a taste of gumbo . " It 's mwah ! Stewed to perfection ! " In the days following the verdict that set Los Angeles ablaze , he got his kicks marching into an elevator full of White folks as the door closed and mumbling , " Yo , that Rodney King s- got me mad as a ME " In truth , however , it 's not Chappelle 's temper but his cool sense of control that allows this costar of The Nutty Professor , Con Air and Robin Hood : Men in Tights to comment on racial inequality with truths that linger after the laughter 's gone . He 's seizing more power in his career with projects like Half Baked , which he cowrote and in which he stars as a man who breaks the law to bail a friend out of jail , and Rufus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better of his master . That 's kind of like Chappelle 's comedy : one foot on the ground , the other up White America 's behind . THESE DAYS TAY DIGGS carries quite a load on his sculpted blackberry shoulders . Soon he 'll be front and center in two major pictures : The Wood , about three young Black men coming of age , and Go , a gritty comedy . But we 'll always admire him for the way he matched wits with screen goddess Angela Bassett in How Stella Got Her Groove Back-his first starring role . His incandescent smile , teach-metonight innocence and tender sincerity gave not only Stella but also every woman in the movie a spark to the heart . It 's no surprise that Taye ( rhymes with say ) bills himself as a student of the body in motion . " I love dancing and I feel a bond with movement , " the 27-year-old says . So Mr. Deejay , how " bout a slow jam ? FEW OF OUR COVERS have stirred as much heat as the one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our February issue this year . Back by popular demand , we bring you Take 2 of the brother with the dreamy dreadlocks , wise smile and body beautiful that had readers everywhere wanting to know more about him . Gentles , who turns 28 this month and is a Wall Street **56;687;TOOLONG , says it goes like this : A couple of years ago a fashion designer saw him in a photo and asked him to model in a show . He got more exposure and caught the attention of ESSENCE . First comes a cover photo shoot , and then Ryan 's face is on magazine stands throughout New York City , where he lives . " It was weird to see my picture everywhere I walked , " he recalls . Gentles recently was featured in a Nancy Wilson video . So what 's next ? " Whatever happens , happens . I just want to be happy , " Gentles says . YOU 'RE DEEP IN A VELVET SEAT at a sold-out performance of Ragtime , the Broadway musical about life in the early 1900 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but somehow you only have eyes for Brian Stokes Mitchell . ( Earlier sightings : Broadway 's Kiss of the Spider Woman and Jelly 's Last Jam , and a seven-year role on TV 's Trapper John , M.D. ) Perhaps you 're riveted to his matinee-idol looks and gentle baritone . Or maybe it 's his power as he steps into the role of Coalhouse Walker , Jr-Ragtime 's proud piano player and shameless ladies ' man . Mitchell imbues Coalhouse with a dashing , noble force that makes tears spill throughout the theater . To see him standing tall is to feel a stab of mourning for all the Black men who have died under the crushing cleats of racism . Mitchell 's voice is a caress as he sings , " Go out/tell our story/let it echo , far and wide/make them hear you/make them hear you . " Oh , yes , Brian Stokes Mitchell , we hear you .
