By the third occasion  --  she could n't exactly call them " dates "  --  Mira thought she had him figured out . Before that she had not been able to determine whether he was a crazy person acting sane or a sane person acting crazy . She had met him through the personals . His ad had described him as " energetic " and " ambitious , " and had said he liked public radio , long moonlight walks , and quiet times at home . They had moved smoothly enough through the early rituals of acquaintance , though there was an awkward moment after she told him where she worked , when he flushed and confessed bleakly that he had dated someone else who worked there . It was a big company , she remarked , and then changed the subject . Finally his quality of manic inertia had proved too much for her . The reason she had seen him a third time had been only to figure him out . Now that she felt she had done so , to the extent possible or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he briskly dropped her off at her door and asked in his odd way , " Want to do it again ? " she answered cheerfully that he should call her the next week . <p> Angela had been having trouble sleeping in the week since the phone calls began . At first she thought if she removed the phone from beside her bed , her sleep would be restored . But she resisted the idea of moving the phone because she did not want to have to think she was undertaking any action in her life whatever as a result of the phone calls . So she lay in bed resenting the caller , with his ridiculous , breathy , high-pitched voice , for demanding with his own illicit attentions any of her attention at all , and she stared at the bedside phone as if it were some small , vicious creature curled up in a sleep that mocked her own wakefulness , whose dormant violence could spring back to life at any second . Finally she removed the phone to the extra bedroom , and then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worrying over her own fear and weakness , and remembering the words of the caller . When she had picked up the phone the first time , she had heard a man 's voice screech a stream of nonsense syllables that sounded something like , " You dare for nothing in the least this fine fine sweetness . " Taken aback , she had stupidly asked who was calling , as if the speaker of such words could be called to account by the common powers of telephone etiquette . Then he shouted clearer obscenities , and she remembered what you were supposed to do in such situations , but as she hurried to hang up the phone , she heard the caller say , " I 'm watching your every fucking move , bitch ! " <p> People at work were starting to notice a quality of distraction in her . She explained it by saying she had not been able to sleep . Often this explanation prompted the intricate elaboration of home remedies for insomnia . She knew that people liked to believe they could cure other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told them about the calls , these same people would offer up a variety of ready-made , makeshift defenses against the sundry threats of violation that were abroad in the world . That would only make it worse , so she decided to keep it to herself so long as he did not call again , and she wondered how much longer she would have to endure her own fear , and listened to her pulse reverberating in her ear as her ear pressed against her pillow . Sometimes the sound of her own pulse comforted her in its familiar regularity , but other times it alarmed her , like the insistent beats of a clock ticking away irreversible time , or as if it were the rhythmic noise of water leaking slowly , drop by drop , from a minute chink at the bottom of a vast but finite reservoir that would one day run dry . <p> Behind his milky blue eyes gathered a cluster of thoughts and ideas that troubled Mira by accumulation . " People should n't believe most of the stuff they believe , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not like there 's stuff they should believe that they do n't believe . " She had only nodded . How else could one respond to such a remark ? The remark had been uttered in the context of what she had thought was a pleasingly circumspect conversation deploring forms of extremist behavior . They had begun by talking about the spate of recent bombings of government buildings , and this led to talk of the rise of private militias in the country , and that in turn led to discussion of the excessive religious fervor or political affiliation that caused such problems in the first place . She had thought they were in basic accord  --  for how could there be two sides , who would defend the terrorists ?  --  when he made his remark . She had nodded , and quickly turned the conversation to the subject of movie stars who became Scientologists . <p> But what did the remark mean ? It had at once the scary force of an injunction and the open destiny , the laissez-faire attitude , of a shrug . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could at least be direct about it . Maybe it was a matter of tone . She was aware of men 's fondness for giving orders , and she knew that when men tried to be sensitive , the effort resided not in resisting the temptation to give orders but in issuing the orders in patient , gentle-sounding voices . His remark had the blunt tone of an order but the complicated structure of a paradox . She felt deeply frustrated that she was smart enough to recognize the kind of knot he had tied but somehow not agile enough to unravel it . It would not be fair , though , to write him off as crazy on the basis of this utterance alone , however readily its sophistry could be used , in the worst of all possible worlds , to justify the violence of mad bombers . It was what she thought his ideas would finally add up to , one by one , that disturbed her . She glanced down the narrow road of this possible future and saw a wall at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth meeting , she told him she was busy . <p> Angela was slicing a red pepper when she cut her finger . The pain was immediate ; it shot to her core . She dropped the knife on the floor . The pain was so sharp it did not seem to be located in the small , deep cut . It seemed to be elsewhere , attached to something larger . She had not been paying enough attention to what she had been doing . How foolish , how foolish . She looked at the cut . It gaped , and some blood began slowly welling into it , but the cut was very deep , and it would take time for the blood to come . She tried to remember where the bandages were . When the blood came it would be the color of the pepper . She gave the faucet a slow turn . Warm water streamed into the sink . She waited for the blood to come . <p> By the middle of the afternoon , the news had traveled throughout the building . Angela , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had broken down in the office and been sent home . There were differing versions in circulation of what terrible thing the package had contained , but what was clear was that it had been some sort of small , dead animal with a string tied , noose-like , around its throat . Mira , in marketing , did not exactly know Angela , but they had friends in common , and it had been because of Angela , indirectly , that Mira had recently decided to try dating through the personals columns . Angela had confided to Maureen Hackett that she was trying it , and Maureen had mentioned it to Mira , and that had been enough to fortify Mira 's curiosity . If a woman of Angela 's beauty could resort to the personals , then Mira , without inordinate shame , could do so , too . Mira had met Angela once at a retirement party a while ago , and on that occasion she had found it necessary to strive consciously to quell her own envy of Angela 's beauty , just as now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty came to , having angry , wounded men send you dead rodents wrapped up in gift boxes . So much of life had to do with resisting the constant tug of meanness . <p> That night , Angela swore to renounce her fear . All day friends and family had comforted her , and she had spoken to the police , and they had comforted her as well , with a comfort more hollow but still welcome . But she hated herself for needing their comfort , and she resolved that she would need it no longer . Her resolve was hardened still further by an interview with a murderer that she happened to see on television . Before , she would have changed the channel , but now she forced herself to watch in a state of disgusted fascination . The murderer was a truck driver with a jowly face and placid , quizzical eyes . He spoke of his killings boastfully but affectlessly . He prided himself on the tricks he played on the police , confessing and recanting , or confessing to crimes he had not committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud it was . The sight of the murderer , and the sound of his calm , even voice as he spoke of the horrors he had inflicted on women , excited a feeling of loathing in Angela . For a period of years he had gone from town to town , taking women from their homes , or snatching them from phone booths , or picking them up in bars . He was especially brutal with the ones he picked up in bars , he said , because they should have known better . The interviewer asked if he felt any remorse , and the murderer answered that sometimes he felt bad that some of the women were dead , but he could not let himself think about it much . The story of the world was that hatred engendered hatred , and Angela believed the reason she was still alone was because she did not want to be a part of this story , or any of the stories that went along with it , but maybe in the long run she would find that she was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , these murderers , for spurring her to be proud of her chosen reclusion , hard in her lonely strength . <p> Mira glimpsed Angela on the mall at lunchtime , walking with another woman , then settling to eat . The other woman looked like a paler , heavier version of Angela . She must have been Angela 's sister , and as Mira watched them she felt a pang of pity for the heavy , pale , plain woman sitting with Angela , pity for having the blessed Angela as her sister . Mira imagined the lifetime of unflattering comparisons such a circumstance would lead to . The afternoon sun was bright , and Angela , smiling and laughing , was wearing designer sunglasses , but her sister was squinting into the daylight , eyes unguarded , contemplatively chewing a bite of a croissant sandwich . It was immediately clear how her sister could make Angela laugh , and it was clear that this ability required no effort on her sister 's part . Her sister enjoyed remaining stoically straight-faced , Mira saw , while Angela laughed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister a stalk of celery , but the offer was refused , and the sister looked away , distance coming into her face , her full cheeks stretching as she turned her head . It was like a little ballet , a stylized pas de deux , thought Mira , an anatomy in mime of a whole history of offering and refusal , advance and withdrawal . She could see Angela 's need of the sister ; she could see how the sister accepted this need but still drew back , and she could see how Angela hardened , without disowning her need . Then she could see how the whole process started over and repeated itself . The sound of Angela 's laughter carried across the mall , so carefree that it bore no traces of recent upset  --  seemed a laugh always ready , imperturbable , but more expressive of sureness in oneself than of pleasure taken in others . This is my sister , Mira imagined Angela saying , she 's the funny one . <p> At dusk Angela stood at the kitchen sink , carefully and slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a boy in the street below wearing a white nightshirt and staring upward . Despite having vowed to renounce fear , she might well have felt a rush of fear all the same if she had not seen at once that he was looking not at her , but past her , up toward the roof of the building . Her third-floor window overlooked a shadowed alleyway , and it was unusual to see anyone passing there , and even more unusual to see , in the midst of the city and in the depth of a cold spring , a nightshirted boy who , with his sharp eyes and delicately flared nostrils and high cheekbones , looked as if he had escaped from an English country manor house . He stood stock still in an attitude of frozen concentration . In the briefest second that she glimpsed the boy 's face , she saw an intense expression of compliance in it , so that it was clear that the boy was exchanging a look with someone who was looking back at him from above . She thought she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a brisk , quick nod , barely perceptible , not of permission but of assent , as if he were receiving and accepting some dark command . Too much steam heat was hissing through the clanging radiators of Angela 's apartment , so she had cranked open the casement window to let in a little cold air as she did the dishes , and because the window had no screen , she could easily extend her head through it ; instinctively she did so , leaned forward out the window , and peered up at the roof to catch a glimpse of whom the boy was looking at , but a twilight glare , bleached and dappled with glimmering black dots , obstructed her view , and when she looked back down at the street , she saw that the figure was moving quickly away . As the figure strode from the effulgent shadow of the alley , rounding a corner into the pale light of the street , Angela saw that it was not a boy at all , but a man , and she saw that what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcoat . <p> Mira agreed to see Justin one last time , just to confirm her foreboding . On the way to the restaurant , he suddenly pointed gleefully at the car in the street ahead of them . The car sported a vanity license plate , elvisfan , and a bumper sticker that said , " God is Pro-Life , " but the bumper sticker and the license plate were not the source of his glee . The car contained two passengers , a man wearing a business suit and a turban in the driver 's seat , and a woman in an elaborate sari sitting behind him in the back seat . Mira and Justin could see only the backs of their heads , the man 's regal headpiece , the woman 's shrouded head . Justin laughed and repeated , " Check it out , check it out ! " He was clearly delighted by this spectacle of subordination . Abruptly , he grew more serious and said , " Last time I looked I thought it was already going on the twenty-first century . " <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed on their previous meetings , but he still shuttled between the dizzyingly bipolar characteristics of the emotionally backward , the bashfulness and the insouciance , the sullenness and the unpredictable , fickle exuberance . As before , he would indulge in occasional half-crazed monologues on arcane topics and then fall silent with an air of stagnating embarrassment . Mira smiled at him across the dinner table with waspish , pseudo-benevolent forbearance in order to encourage this embarrassment , which appeared to have the effect of warding off , or at least postponing , the monologues . Because she knew she would not see him again , she felt expansive and lighthearted as she gazed at his wide , chary face with his too-small eyeglasses , their arms straining to the sides across his temples in their effort to encompass the breadth of the face , to reach the big , far-off ears . <p> Unexpectedly , Justin embarked on a new monologue that occupied the rest of the meal , souring Mira 's mood . If you do n't have theories about things , Justin believed , then you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a point of honor to have a theory about everything , and one of these theories was that you should not talk about relationships right away in a relationship but if you do not talk about relationships early on in a relationship , it is a very bad sign for that relationship . He wanted her to know of his past , but she could not know of this unless she understood that he still loved the few women he had loved in his life . He hoped this would not disturb her . He still loved them , and he knew that he would always love them , and he was glad of this , for he believed , he sincerely believed , that if it is the case that love , real love , can die , then it must be the case that life has no meaning . His mother had often spoken , he told Mira , of a man , another man she might have married if she had not married his father . She had once loved this man , and she spoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a fond rise out of his father ; then , after Justin 's father died , his mother had met this man again , and she realized after all those years what she had really known all along , that she no longer loved the man . When she told Justin this , she had expected him to feel some kind of relief , as if the memory of his father were being properly honored , but instead he had felt furiously disappointed , disillusioned , enraged . If his mother could stop loving this other man , then how could he be sure she would never forget his father , or even that she would always love Justin himself ? If love had an end , how could one be sure of anything ? <p> " I 'm going to tell you something I think you already know , " said Justin . " No two people are ever in the same place at the same time . And what that means is , is that in any relationship , one person is always ahead of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at different times , and maybe one 's ahead in some ways and the other 's ahead in other ways , and it , like , switches around and stuff , but one is always ahead of the other , no matter what . I 'm not telling you anything you do n't know already . I know you know it . I know from stuff you 've said , because even though we 're just starting we have this simpatico thing going and we basically think alike , and in any human relationship , and I 'm talking human here , not just romantic-type stuff , but every time you 're with anyone else , it 's basically about giving and getting , giving and getting , and it 's basically this back-and-forth thing , either you 're giving and they 're getting or they 're giving and you 're getting , and for there to be something really mutual there , to be giving and getting at the same time , is just very very very rare , and when that happens you should never ever let it go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I mean really real , then it 's always going to be still there . I just want you to know this up-front so there are no surprises later ; I 'm just a really up-front kind of person . " <p> He began a detailed history of several past relationships , breaking off from time to time to ask if he was boring her . When she answered that she was not bored , she thought she was being truthful , since she was conscious only of growing increasingly scared , but she realized with a dulled sensation of slow discovery in the course of the monologue that fear and boredom were not incompatible states . She tuned out for only a moment to consider whether it would be easier to excuse herself and flee or to wait out the rest of the evening in careful silence . When she rejoined his discourse , he had somehow moved from the subject of his old girlfriends to that of popular misconceptions about leprosy . She interrupted gently to tell him she was not feeling well and wanted to leave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded his napkin and placed it on the table in front of him . On the way to the car , he said nothing , but he walked so fast that she had to break into a run every few steps to keep up with him . She had wondered earlier why he had parked on the same street where he had parked last time they had gone out , even though the restaurant they had gone to then had been several blocks in the opposite direction , but she had concluded that this reflected the staunch commitment to habitual behavior that marked a certain type of obsessive personality . Now , though , as he opened the door of the car for her , Mira noticed that he was looking with steely directness at a window , a particular window , in a row of apartments down the block . As Mira got into the car , she followed with her own eyes the direction of his gaze , and she saw what she thought was the silhouette of a figure moving quickly past the window . Then he slammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the same , a sharp , unexpected thought registering in Angela 's brain just at the decisive moment of sleep 's onset , as if its prevention were an urgent need . Usually the thoughts were trivial , their ability to wake her mysterious , and Angela sat up in bed wondering at her continued failure to achieve the condition of sleep , a state formerly accessible without effort , without the thought of achievement , or of failure , or , for that matter , of success . <p> This time the thought that jolted her  --  intrusive , violent , stealing into her mind like a mugger lurching into a dark alleyway , shocking her awake  --  was surprising not for its insignificance but for its magnitude . What if it was someone she knew-someone she had dated , or even someone who worked in her office ? Suddenly she recalled the face of the last man she 'd gone out with . His face had been sharp-jawed , the features severe , and his skin was pale , and cast in a delicate shade of pink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin looked like a blush , as if he had just been fondly teased and was mildly , pleasantly embarrassed , but the blush never went away , and it gave him an aura of vulnerability despite the hardness and sharpness of his features . Around the edges of his face , at the line of his straw-colored hair , was a thin border of skin of a different color , barely perceptible between the red and the straw , closer to the more ordinary tones of white skin , and this border made it appear as if he were wearing a mask , and the mask was a blush . <p> It had been nearly three months ago that they had gone out , and she had seen him only a few times , but she had slept with him the last time , and then they had never called each other again . They had not called each other even though , as they were parting after sex , they had each whispered that they would call the other the next day . The very fact of whispering had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed with no call , and then a week went by , and a month , and with time she knew more completely what she had already known then , even as she had whispered in the darkness to the man she had just slept with , that the intimacy was not real . <p> She tried to recall the man 's voice , so she could imagine his voice speaking those awful words , but she could bring to mind only the way his voice sounded when he whispered . Then she remembered that she had seen him , or someone who might have been him , in the food court of a mall a few weeks before . She had been with her sister , and he had been with an overweight woman who had a star-shaped bruise on the back of one of her hands and was ravenously eating a pizza . Angela said nothing about it to her sister , but she imagined a flicker of recognition and rebuke in the man 's eyes . If it had been him , he had changed in the short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyeglasses and a gaudy earring , and a thick clump of hair sprouted from his chin and pointed down at the ground . These features were new , but even from a distance and under the mall 's artificial light , she could see that the color of his skin was the same and the border at the hair that made it look like a mask was the same . Still , she had concluded that it was not him , but as she and her sister were leaving the food court to go on with their shopping , she had seen the man slowly begin to scratch his forehead with a deliberately extended middle finger as he seemed to gaze at her , a gesture of ambiguous contempt . She had hurried her sister away , and in spite of a moment 's alarm , she had not spoken of the incident . <p> Some of the alarm she felt then returned as she remembered the event . Perhaps the man had felt betrayed by her failure to call him after they had , if not achieved genuine intimacy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , done what was necessary to achieve it . But why then did she not feel , in turn , betrayed by his failure to call her ? If he had done so , she would have seen him again . She would probably even have slept with him again . She had not been attracted to him , but she had slept with him because of his gentleness , and because she did not want to hurt him by refusing him . She herself had lived with her own beauty for all of her thirty-one years , and creeps who had seemed nice at first always claimed it was her beauty that drove them to creepiness , so she knew how unexpectedly gentleness could depart . As she 'd gazed at his body , she experienced a distant , vague stirring of repulsion . The skin of his chest was very white , marked by many imperfections , and in the hollow of his chest were several ruddy creases , like the grainy wrinkles in sand that an ebbed tide leaves behind on a beach . She resisted the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muted disgust with his eager sweetness produced a rush of tenderness in her that subsided as she undressed . He looked and looked at her after she undressed , and she could see the emotion in his blush-red face , but she could not tell if he was moved by her beauty itself , or by her willingness to give herself to him . " I knew you were beautiful , " he said ; and because of the way he emphasized the word " knew , " she had thought he was going to finish the sentence by saying something like , " But I never dreamed you were this beautiful . " He did not complete the thought in this manner , though . Instead , he had whispered , " I am seeing you in a different way " ; and she had replied , also in a whisper , " I 'm still what I was . " <p> Justin left three messages on Mira 's answering machine over the next two days . The first was solicitous , wondering how she was . The second contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out , her sudden illness could not have been serious , since she was already back to work . The third was direct : " Look , I 'm not the kind of person who 's very good at playing games , okay , " said his voice , muffled by the bad sound quality of the overused tape . " So if you 're not going to call could you kind of let me know instead of just leaving me totally hanging ? " Mira was stunned : He wanted her to call to tell him she was not going to call . It was some completely new form of passive-aggression , yet to be catalogued by the experts . She was listening to his message again in continued disbelief when the phone rang . It was Justin . <p> " So were you just not going to call or what ? " he asked . <p> " I do n't know , " said Mira . " I do n't respond well to hostility , I know that much . " <p> " Are we just , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " answered Mira , " we are just , like , off . " <p> " Can I ask why ? " <p> " I do n't know if I can give you answers . I do n't know if I really want to get into it . " <p> " Oh , well , that 's just great . Is n't that just typical . I mean , you women : You 're always , like , ' Men just ca n't communicate and it 's just so terrible and blah blah blah blah blah , ' and so here I am trying to communicate and look who 's the one that does n't want to communicate . " <p> " I do n't really know , " said Mira , " if I would call this trying to communicate . " <p> " I 'm sorry . Okay ? I 'm sorry . " Mira heard him taking deep breaths . Then she heard him resume in the voice she recognized , his earnest , sad-sack voice , only now she saw that this voice , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetual that it goes underground , lurks there , learns to imitate reason , waits to break out . " I really am sorry , " he said . " Can I just ask you what it was that I did wrong ? I think it would really help me to know . I mean , for the future . " <p> The resort to cliche , Mira speculated , might prove to be the quickest way out . " It 's not you , " she said . " It 's me . " <p> " Because everything seemed to be going good , you know , and it really seemed to be building , and like developing , and I was getting to know you , and you were getting to know me , and you really seemed to like me . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " said Mira . <p> " So if I could just know what I did that was wrong . " <p> " It was n't anything you did . " Mira decided she would try one last gambit . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maniacs do not recognize their own thoughts when those thoughts return in altered form to beset them , some maniacs do . " Let 's just put it this way , " she said . " In any relationship one person is always ahead of the other ; so why do n't we just say you 're ahead of me , and leave it at that ? " <p> She knew the risk had not paid off and the silence that followed was an angry silence when he said in a withering voice , " I see . " Then he went on : " Well , I guess the shoe is really on the other foot now , is n't it ? All that talk , all that talk about men not being able to commit , but when it comes right down to it , we can see exactly what that 's all about , now , ca n't we , and you know what it 's all about ? Hypocrisy , that 's what . Hypocrisy , pure and simple . " <p> " Please , Justin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't commit . Why do n't we just say goodbye now ? I do n't want to have to hang up on you . " <p> " But you will have to , " said Justin . " Okay ? You 'll have to . Because I 'm not going to . So go ahead . Hang up . Hang up . Go ahead . Turn the last screw . " <p> Mira waited only a second before she hung up . <p> The hard rain that had fallen all day turned suddenly to snow at nightfall , big wet flakes wafting downward slowly . Driving to the store for milk and cranberry juice , Angela saw a handicapped man crossing a street . One of his legs listed wildly to the side as he walked , the sign of some neuromuscular affliction , and Angela , stopped at a light , regarded him in the moment before she drove on with a combination of pity and gratitude . Imagine living in such a condition , where the simplest task demanded the most daunting work , where every few steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She took the man 's laborious trek across the street as a reminder to appreciate her own comparative good fortune . On the way back from the store , she saw the same man standing a little farther on from where he had been , in the middle of the street , in Angela 's lane of traffic . Although it was dark , the snow lit the night , so she saw him in plenty of time to stop , but the road was slick , and as she braked she felt the car slide before it came to a stop . Her heart quickened . She shouted to the man , and as he turned in an antic pirouette to face her , she realized that he was not handicapped at all , but drunk . His tongue was sticking out , gathering snowflakes , and there was a look of scorn in his face , of intoxicated derision . He smiled at Angela malevolently . In his smile Angela saw the drunkard 's recognition , which she knew from having shared it when she herself was drunk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept from absurdity only by virtue of being a self , a self that , distilled , is somehow still one 's own . All these separate entities , a multitude of oblivious monads , each subscribing to the absurdity of all the others , and the essential rightness of itself : What kind of a world was that ? She shouted to the drunk man that he was standing in the middle of the street , and he said it was all right because there was nobody else there . " But I am , " Angela cried , " I 'm here . " <p> " Keep going , " said the man , " and get gone , and then you wo n't be . " <p> Mira avoided going into Maureen Hackett 's cubicle at work because its aura of smug domesticity felt oppressive to her . Maureen Hackett 's desk was cluttered with plastic stand-up frames containing photographs of her husband and her two children in a variety of dispositions , from the diurnal pleasure of ordinary life to the posed ritual of special occasions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more photographs were pinned to the industrial-tweed covering of the cubicle 's walls , kids blowing out birthday candles , family groupings in exotic vacation spots , forthright displays of the conspicuous consumption of happiness . The photographs gave Mira the willies . Though she did not doubt that the happiness they chronicled was real , the amplitude of its evidence made her think of it as a greedy happiness . The whole family was cursed with big-toothed smiles that showed their bright , pink gums . Their gaping leers of happiness in the photographs spoke to Mira of unquenchable voracity , insatiability , as if they wanted , the lot of them , to hoard happiness , to squirrel it away , even if it meant others might not get any ; as if they would not hesitate to lap up , hoggishly , as much as they could of this scant resource . Mira had to get Maureen Hackett 's approval of a memo before she sent it out , and as she signed off , Maureen murmured the lowdown on Angela . The package was not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had also been phone calls , and Angela felt she was being followed , watched . Once she thought she had been followed in the parking garage . <p> It was Justin , Mira knew immediately ; it was Justin who was stalking Angela . <p> Once she had articulated this to herself , the wonder was only that she had not done so sooner . It made cold , lean sense . It fell into place with sharp precision , like the clean-edged segments of a thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle . The varieties of a family 's happiness can be verified because there are photographs , millions upon millions , to commemorate every one of them ; the fact that no pictures document the grubby thoughts of lone , rapacious , anti-social men who spend their time in festering solitude hatching insidious plots does not refute the certitude with which those , too , can be known . They had answered the same ad , Mira and Angela ; he said he had dated someone else from her office . Angela had seen him once , twice , maybe three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he had felt this as a profound rebuke to him . Mira knew that Justin was the kind of man who would interpret Angela 's beauty as a form of arrogance , and he would see her rejection of him , because of her beauty , as a crime of the spirit , as evidence that she , like other beautiful people , felt herself exempt from the decencies of ordinary life . He had wanted to know what he had done , but there had been nothing that he had done , and once he understood this , then he knew that if it was not anything he had done then it was he , he himself , that was the problem . It was not his outward action , but his inner essence , and this could only be overwhelming to him because he had to know it meant he could never be acceptable , for one can perhaps change one 's action , but one can never alter one 's essence . <p> The hurt was as profound as his very self was now felt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let go of it , to put it aside as he would surely see himself as having been put aside . <p> No : She had hurt him , and now he would have to hurt her . It was a matter of giving and getting . <p> So he went on dates with other women , and he parked on her street each time , and glared up at her window , thinking to parade these other women before her , to show her there were women who did not find him profoundly , immovably unacceptable , to show her he had moved on but that she would never in turn be able to elude him . He called her with tidings of assault . He followed her , he sent her horrors through the mail . Maureen Hackett spoke of these things quietly . In no sense did she appear to be afraid for herself . Her tone was one of measured concern , tinged with gossip 's lurid curiosity . There was no telling , she said , where it would end . <p> At a movie with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped away into the lobby . She whispered to her sister that she would be right back . Absorbed in the film , her sister looked startled , and in the second it took her to comprehend that Angela had said something ordinary , not something startling , her hand darted out protectively for Angela 's hand ; after that second passed , she drew her hand away and nodded to acknowledge her understanding . The lobby was empty , the hulking computer games blinking in silent , colorful disbelief . Ushers pushed popcorn-devouring sweepers across the hard carpets . All of the many films at the multiplex were underway in their separate enclaves , and any stray patrons who wandered out into the lobby were suspect because their presence there signified discontent . It meant they were constitutionally unhappy , dissatisfied with the film , unable to accept direct pleasures or to defer random needs . These patrons clearly sensed that whatever lack their presence exposed lay within themselves , for they shuffled through the lobby with their heads bowed in shame . Angela refused to play that game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request loudly . Her sister had reached for her hand ; then , as she had drawn her hand away , she had done so with what seemed to Angela a quality of shamed recognition of something that was deep , full , but evanescent , too small to be spoken of . The older , Angela had been her sister 's guardian when they were children . She remembered pushing her sister in a swing , how her cries of joy could so easily be heard as screams of fear . The moment of shamed recognition , Angela saw , implied a feeling of rueful commiseration in her sister , kept from pity by force of will , that her sister thought she should resist . Now , between them , Angela 's safety might always be at issue . She wondered if she were more vulnerable to the assaults of unknown men or to the consolations of those who loved her . Her sister did not look away from the film when Angela returned to her seat . <p> Mira could not find Angela 's address in the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though she had never been to his apartment , she knew where Justin lived . His building was wedged into a busy corner , a corner in the city where five streets came together in a treacherous intersection . The building , with brick the color of an underripe peach 's flesh , was shaped like a narrow-tipped triangle in order to fit into the severe bight of the street corner . There was a drugstore on the first floor , and there were apartments on the second and third floors . In the vestibule Mira scanned a row of six mail slots , doors of tarnished copper with circular , barred clefts in each door showing what the little chambers held . None of the slots was locked , and Justin 's yawned open carelessly . Such indifference to security did not surprise Mira . She knew that intruders into the lives of others seldom consider their own susceptibility until the moment of their victimization , when their sense of indignity is boundless . As Mira shuffled through Justin 's mail , she imagined his outrage with amused satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flouting secrecy , adopting an artless , genial watchfulness as an antidote to caution . Anyone who happened upon her would never mistake her for a trespasser . <p> Mira did not know which window was Justin 's . She did not know which floor he lived on . From her car , parked on a near side street that afforded a wide view , she scanned the rows of windows . Some of the windows had latticework covering them , imitating a European style . Others had rusted air conditioners hanging from them like guts protruding from under the shirts of beer-bellied men . In one of the windows , only her face visible , stood a woman with a kerchief tied around her head . She was looking downward , pensively content , engaged in an unseen task , chopping vegetables or preparing meat . In another window that was covered by a translucent shade , a light blinked on and off at irregular , convulsive intervals . Mira looked at the letter she had kept out of Justin 's mailbox . It had a return address from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only an instrument ; she had no curiosity about the envelope 's contents . That was no more the point than it was the point that the task at hand was a test of her courage . She would leave ideas about bravery to the invaders , the pursuers , the warriors of infringement . They were the ones who thrived on such ideas . She was interested only in justice . <p> Just when she was starting to think her mission would be fruitless , Justin appeared on the stoop , blinking under the dim light of a street lamp . He was carrying a satchel , its leather scarred and bruised . He hoisted its long strap over his shoulder . He walked in Mira 's direction , passed very near her car , and got into his own car parked farther down the street . She followed him downtown to a street near the city market . He parked and got out of the car , and pulled on the door 's handle to make sure it was locked . After he had started away , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make doubly sure . What fortune was he taking such trouble to protect ? Mira watched him cross the street and disappear into a storefront with big glass panels painted black and with three white letters , A-I-M , painted across the door . She did not know what the letters stood for . Mira peered into the back seat of Justin 's car . A rumpled coat and scarf , a thick , dog-eared map that bore traces of the frustration of someone who had tried to refold it , a lone tennis shoe . She lifted one of the car 's windshield wipers . It felt brittle and fragile , like a skeleton 's arm . She placed the letter under the windshield wiper . At first he would think it was a parking ticket . When he had come so close to her car , she had felt something rise in her , a thrill , something she felt that she wanted at once to resist and to follow to its apex . If he had chanced to notice her , she would have looked back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , she tried to feel what she knew he would feel , the clandestine tremor of nearness . But she could not incite this feeling in herself , it was nothing she could share . <p> The first call came that night . No speech : just a long , crackling silence , meant to threaten . <p> Angela had stopped seeing a man she 'd loved many years ago after she discovered he kept copies of his letters to her . He wrote beautiful letters to her , and she loved them . Then one day he told her he had been unsure of the date of something so he had looked it up in the letters . " But how could you ? " she asked . " I have them . " " I keep copies , " he answered . " You keep copies of your letters to me ? " " Oh , I keep copies of all my letters . " Some weeks later she broke off with him . The letters reminded her of him . Like him , they were usually matter-of-fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her believe he had given her something , but he had not . He had kept it . <p> From the bar , Mira watched Justin and another woman at a table across the restaurant . The place was a big , open room , lit dimly , and Mira sat at the far end of the bar so she could face their table . She wanted to be seen , but Justin sat with his back to her . He had parked in the same place , on the same street , looked up , Mira was certain , at the same window . It was a cycle , and this was another round of the cycle . The woman who was with him had black hair and thick black eyebrows . She did not appear to be uncomfortable , but that was because she could not know . Sometimes Justin leaned toward her across the table , grimly attentive , but most of the time he leaned back and looked distractedly around the room . Their interaction had the air of an unsuccessful audition . The cycle would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to end it . She drank two scotches as they finished their dinner . As they were leaving , she walked right in front of them , and looked into Justin 's face , unblinking , but if he noticed her , he did not react . <p> When the phone rang that night , she listened to the silence for only a moment before she spoke . " Do you think I do n't know who this is ? " she said . " I know exactly what you 're doing . But it 's going to stop now . Do you understand me ? You 're going to leave me alone , and you 're going to leave her alone . Do you hear me ? Just leave her the fuck alone . " She had managed to speak calmly , but when she hung up she was overpowered by a rush of deferred feeling . She would change her phone number the next day . The decision to protect yourself , once taken , is easy enough to put into practice . <p> They met in the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a long time since they had been introduced . She said it was good to see her again . Angela was about to leave when Mira stopped her . She said she was sorry , but there was something else she had to talk to her about . There was a man , a certain man . Did she know him ? <p> Mira said his name . Angela 's face emptied for a minute , then it filled up again . She had been afraid that this stranger was going to offer her more heedless consolation , but now she understood . She bit her lip and looked away for a moment . The row of mirrors reflected them : two women , standing side by side . She nodded . <p> Mira thought she 'd heard something outside the door . She waited in the hallway . She saw that she had forgotten to draw the curtains . That meant she might also have forgotten to lock the door . Midnight blustered , cold , outside the cold , exposed windowpane . For long minutes the doorknob did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was alone . She was in a specific place , but she imagined abstract distance . In her mind she saw gray hills rolling in a vast mist . It was pain that gave rise to understanding . You do not feel the need to understand until after your fullest want has been denied . If that was true , then maybe something , too , would bloom from this fear . She stood fast in the hallway . Light came in the window . She might have felt revealed , but her solitude seemed secure . Her hand went to her mouth . <p> <p> By James Morrison <p>
