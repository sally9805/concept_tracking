MUNICIPAL WASTE MANAGERS SEE HOT PROSPECTS IN ROT <p> Coffee grounds , soiled disposable diapers , eggshells , cucumber skins , soggy paper towels , used cat litter , holiday wrapping paper , dessicated Christmas trees , chicken bones , empty cereal boxes , the fat trimmed from last night 's roast  --  the United States generates roughly 124 million tons of such largely organic garbage annually That averages out to 2.6 pounds per day for every man , woman , and child in the country . <p> The venerable tradition of landfilling these gooey smelly often rotting materials has come under increasing criticism : Not only do chemicals in buried wastes frequently migrate into air and groundwater , but land for solid-waste burial also commands a premium price one many communities can not easily afford . So solid-waste managers have been struggling to find new ways of coping with these organic discards . <p> Many who looked to Mother Nature for inspiration are now investigating municipal composting . Though most older , mixed-waste compost programs have provoked strong criticism from environmental groups , several pilot projects now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this rotting business . <p> These experimental " source-separated " programs require homeowners to segregate compostables from other household garbage before setting either out for trash haulers . It may not seem like a big deal , but this in-home trash segregation departs significantly from most existing municipal composting schemes and goes a long way toward ensuring a cleaner , " greener " product . <p> <p> Like the backyard compost heap , municipal composting relies on naturally present bacteria to break down food scraps , wood , and paper . nurture those microbes , compost managers regularly turn the wastes - ensuring thorough aeration and providing the bacteria access to all the wastes . Maintaining a relatively high humidity and temperature  --  50 to 60 degrees Celsius for at least three days  --  speeds breakdown of the wastes and kills resident pathogens . <p> Thanks to all those food scraps , the resulting crumbly , humus-like compost is high in nutrients and makes a rich soil amendment for farmers , gardeners , an plant nurseries . <p> Community composting in the United States evolved largely from programs designed to manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wood chips . By diverting such materials from burial , communities can cut their tipping fees per-ton payment to landfill operators-by as much as 20 percent . <p> As communities sought further methods for cutting their hefty solid-waste-management budget , several began diverting high-value noncompostables  --  typically glass , metal , and plastics  --  to recycling . But the recent recession has forced additional belt tightening and prompted more than a dozen communities to add food and paper composting to their waste-management programs . <p> Most of these programs collect compostables mixed with other household trash , observes Jan Beyea , chief scientist with the National Audubon Society in New York City Waste programs later cull the materials to be composted at a central facility Unfortunately Beyea notes , no proven means exists for reliably removing all hazardous materials from clean compostables once they have been mixed . Consequently , worrisome levels of toxic contaminants frequently lace resulting composts . <p> Donald J. Lisk of Cornell University 's Toxic Chemicals Laboratory in Ithaca , N.Y. , scouted for such contaminants in composts from 26 different programs . To conduct his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The starting composts included seven derived from yard wastes only three from sewage sludge , four from municipal solid wastes ( MSW ) , two from a mixture of MSW and yard wastes , one from a sludge-MSW mix , and two from a mix of all three sources . <p> In the April 1992 ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND Toxicology , Lisk reports that in contrast to composted sludge and yard wastes , MSW-derived composts invariably contained polychlorinated biphenyls . MSW-based composts also contained levels of toxic heavy metals that matched or exceeded those from sewage sludge . In fact , MSW derived composts tended to lead the pack in levels of lead and sodium . <p> But when people sort compostable wastes at their source  --  the home or business  --  prior to trash pickup , the metal content of the resulting compost drops dramatically , notes Jackie Prince , a staff scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington , D.C. In the July 1992 RESOURCE RECYCLING , she compares North American and European data on composts made from source  --  separated municipal wastes and those derived from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Prince reports , levels of lead and other toxic metals tend to run 60 to 80 percent lower in composts from source-separated wastes . <p> Lisk 's data also indicate that asbestos is " a widespread contaminant in all kinds of municipal composts , " ranging from trace amounts to 1 percent of the volume in ash . The source of this carcinogen ? Most likely brake linings and construction materials , he says . <p> Currently , notes Ellen Z. Harrison of Cornell 's Waste Management Institute , " we have no national standards for compost quality , and there are standards in only a handful of states . " Concludes Lisk , " Without evaluating the composition of these composts and without adequate regulations forcing such analyses , we 're facing a widespread and potentially serious problem . " <p> <p> Beyea and other environmentalists agree and have argued strongly against policies that encourage the production of municipal composts from mixed wastes . Indeed , Beyea observes , Audubon and representatives of the Cincinnati-based Procter and Gamble ( P &G); Co. " were going head-to-head with each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a division of the 3-year-old National Recycling Coalition , headquartered in Washington , D.C. It was a real battle , he recalls , and the public opposition it threatened to spawn risked derailing composting as a viable municipal-waste strategy . <p> So RAC made Beyea and Bruce Jones of P &G; cochairs of its subcommittee on composting and encouraged them to thrash out their differences . Instead , they decided to join forces and forge a technology both could live with . Those efforts culminated in a 30-day experiment last spring involving roughly 300 households in Fairfield and Greenwich , Conn . <p> Both towns had been separating household wastes for recycling . Now volunteers were asked to segregate " wet " compostable materials ( food scraps , soiled paper products , and so on ) for a separate trash pickup . In addition , three McDonald 's restaurants agreed to sort their compostable " behind-the-counter " wastes . On average , 40 percent of the participants ' wastes were recycled , another 30 percent composted . This 70 percent diversion from landfills is " particularly impressive , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yard wastes , " which represent nearly 20 percent of solid waste in many communities . " <p> Trash haulers loaded bags of compostables , collected weekly , into a chipper along with yard wastes , which served as a bulking agent , and ground the mix into pieces small enough to fit through a 4-inch mesh screen . They then fed the shredded wastes into the end of a 220 foot-long indoor concrete trench . Ducts in the floor of the trench sucked air through the windrow of wastes at rates regulated by temperature sensors in the trench walls . <p> Four times a week , a paddle-wheel-like agitator straddling the windrow turned the wastes . During each agitation cycle . the wastes were shoved farther down the trench . By the end of a month , the compost had reached the end of the trench , where it was screened for plastics and other noncompostable debris . With up to eight weeks ' further storage in tarp-covered outdoor windrows , the compost cured into a finished product . <p> According to an interim report on the project released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly metals generally fall well below the NOAEL ( no observable adverse effects level ) set by the Environmental Protection Agency for land application of sewage sludge . <p> Results of initial field tests by the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven , to be published soon , also suggest that the compost may prove a boon to crops . Compared to conventionally fertilized fields , those amended with an additional 50 tons per acre of this compost yielded 38 percent more tomatoes . This reflects " a 25 percent increase in the number of tomatoes per plant and an 11 percent increase in the average weight of each tomatoes notes soil chemist Charles R. Frink . <p> If applications of compost are repeated this spring , as expected , " we 'd anticipate seeing an even greater effect in the next few years , " he says , since the value of such soil amendments tends to be cumulative . Overall , he says , the higher yields can be attributed to the compost 's liming effect ( its pH is slightly higher than that of normal soil ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the improved soil structure produced by adding this easily crumbled organic matter . <p> We 've also been looking at this compost as an affordable replacement for sphagnum peat moss in potting soil , " Frink says , " and it does quite well . ' His state has a large potting-soil and nursery industry , he notes , and the price of peat moss is escalating . <p> <p> New York City is also studying source-separated composting at Nits Fresh Kills landfill site on Staten Island . Unlike the Audubon-P &G; program , New York 's residential compost project does not accept disposable diapers , pet wastes , cardboard ( which is recycled ) , or coated papers . This experiment is also lower tech : Wastes decompose in uncovered , outdoor windrows . Even its compost recipe is different . While the Connecticut compost derives from a mixture of three parts household waste to one part filler , New York 's comprises two parts leaves and two parts chipped Christmas trees to one part municipal waste . <p> But the ongoing New York program is 15 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ households . Moreover , notes Thomas Outerbridge , the project 's coordinator , it 's just the first of many composting programs New York City is developing . Earlier this month , his office initiated a six-month venture collecting food wastes for composting from eight Staten Island institutions , including a hospital , psychiatric institute , and prison . Also planned : an indoor composting system to manage the organic wastes associated with feeding 17,000 inmates on Rikers Island , and a large , full-scale plant elsewhere to compost wastes collected from institutional and commercial facilities . <p> Guelph , Ontario , has an even older source separated pilot study of municipal-waste composting . Begun iii August 1989 , it now services 825 households . And next month , the city expects approval from the Canadian government for the construction of a permanent facility to compost and recycle wastes for all 90,000 Guelph residents . Like the Audubon-P &G; experiment , the Guelph program collects a wide range of household organic materials , including diapers and pet wastes . Unlike the New York and Connecticut programs , however , recyclable wastes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results from our pilot study have shown that 67 percent of residential waste is either compostable or recyclable . " However , when residents were left to decide how to apportion their wastes - among bags destined for composting , recycling , or the landfill - many erred in favor of the landfill . <p> " We found about 40 percent of the garbage destined for landfills could have been composted or recycled , " Bozic says . Now Guelph uses mechanical means at a central facility to sort outrecyclable wastes from debris intended for burial . What 's more , she adds , the two phase , wet-dry ( compostable-everything else ) collection scheme is more economical because a single truck can pick up both . <p> Indeed , collection logistics  --  what type of truck to use , how many runs must be made through a neighborhood each week , how many categories of waste should be source-separated  --  remain major unresolved issues for most municipalities experimenting with composting . <p> <p> In the past , composting has " always been a kid brother to conventional recycling , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council . " Only now is it starting to get its own recognition . " And the result , he says , " is that it 's really starting to take off . " <p> Monk says there 's " a rule of thumb that when tipping fees hit $50 a ton , you start thinking about composting . " And by that yardstick , he argues , much of the Northeast and most large US. urban communities qualify . <p> But " source-separated composting is still in its infancy , " Monk maintains . Even in Holland , Denmark , and Germany , where community composting is far more established , he says , " you probably ca n't point to more than half-a-dozen communities each with source-separated programs . " <p> Source separation appears to have a growing following , however , partly because of the new pilot programs and data they are generating . Next month , the Recycling Advisory Council will sponsor a symposium to highlight such data . <p> But composting and other , more traditional forms of recycling may not always prove the best option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Local Self-Reliance , a Washington , D.C.  --  based research center focusing on waste issues . " Our goal is to derive the highest possible value from discarded materials , " she says . For instance , " it is possible to manufacture things like ethanol , a cleaner burning fuel than gasoline from wood and yard wastes . And that would be better than compost . " <p> BioEnergy International , L.C. , of Gainesville , Fla. , holds the patent on a process for fermenting organic wastes into ethanol . To date , the company has marketed its technology mostly to companies that generate large quantities of paper and agricultural wastes . However , notes Philip Horton , the company 's vice president of engineering , the process should prove economical for yard wastes and certain portions of municipal solid waste . In fact , his company is currently investigating pilot-scale studies to ferment wastes from potato  --  and other food-processing industries . <p> " Composting is not a magic bullet , " Cornell 's Harrison cautions . " Done wrong , it is an expensive way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But " done right , " she says , " it holds promise for a significant part of our municipal solid waste .
