" If you had just a few minutes in which to say something to a younger generation of church leaders , what would you say ? " That question was recently posed to some senior church leaders who had held major positions in denominational or ecumenical organizations . The following are excerpts from some of their remarks , which were delivered to an audience at Hartford Seminary in Hartford , Connecticut . The event , part of the seminary 's Leadership Education Program , supported by the Lilly Endowment , was convened by seminary dean William McKinney and former United Church of Christ president Avery D. Post . JAMES MASE AULT , retired bishop of the United Methodist Church and former president and secretary of the UMC Council of Bishops : Give attention to your own spirituality and Christian formation day by day . I would urge you to read and reflect on the scriptures , so that your prayers are compassionate , wise and responsible . For from this center issues your identity as a Christian person . It is the source of your strength and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender-inclusive society , affirm the eternal value of every human being . And in the face of ever person you meet , see the Christ . Therefore , listen , listen , listen , especially to those who might not share your point of view , and listen to that person who sees his or her role on every issue as that of standing over against you . Struggle to be faithful to the whole gospel , holding in creative tension personal salvation and social transformation . Hans Kung reminds us that " that person who preaches one half of the gospel is no less a heretic than that person who preaches the other half of the gospel . " In ecumenical relations , represent your own tradition with knowledge and integrity . And seek to know the distinctive emphases of other traditions , including other religions . Laugh and cry with others . But most of all be able to laugh at yourself . Finally , in the words of the apostle Paul , " do not think of yourself more highly than you ought to think , but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of faith God has given to you . " ROBERT C. CAMPBELL , for 15 years general secretary of the American Baptist Churches in the USA : The one thing I would say is : Lead and manage from within  --  within , not over , your colleagues . Leadership means , of course , being in a representative role because you have come out of the church , out of the community . But do n't be so identified with the community that you can not lead it . Do n't represent a pressure group or an individual viewpoint , but seek the mind of Christ through biblical and theological understandings . Therefore , keep thinking and studying . Listen to all the people , but manage from within  --  not as the authoritarian boss , not by controlling or dominating , and certainly not by abdicating leadership , but by relating to other people , and by choosing the right people and supporting them . If correction is needed and a tough thing needs to be said , you 're still the one to do it . But all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because he is the one for whom ultimately you work . JAMES CLINTON HOGGARD , retired bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church : First , be wise as a serpent , be harmless as a dove . Give people the benefit of the doubt regarding their sincerity , but keep your wits about you ; they might not be as truthful as they seem . Second , be courageous , be your own person . If you know that you are called of God for the service that you perform , work within the system , but within that system make new decisions and cut new paths . Do not be afraid to venture into new areas and challenge the system sometimes , because much of it is human , and you 're working to make it divine . Third , be faithful to your understanding of the heavenly vision ; if you are not obedient to it , you may become disillusioned . But if you remember your call , you will be able to overcome the disappointments and the mistrust , and you will also see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need the strength that comes only from God , the strength to be able to say , I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me . JAMES K. MATHEWS , for 32 years a bishop of the United Methodist Church : Cling relentlessly to the quality of openness . This is the most important spiritual attitude . I regard it also as a most important mode of administration . I mean openness to God , openness to criticism and self-criticism , openness to others , and openness to the future . I think this quality is what St. Paul had in mind when he talked about forgetting the things that are behind and straining to reach what lies ahead . This is important because not all the facts are in , they 're never in . The book has not been closed . If we think it has , we become rigid . How frequently through the years I 've been disappointed with people because I 've found their minds utterly closed . Jesus emphasized openness . Remember that great passage in the seventh chapter of Mark where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ephphatha , ... Be opened . " I 'm just naive enough to suppose that when the Aramaic  --  the language Jesus spoke  --  is preserved , we 're on to something pretty authentic and basic . But there is also the parable of the soils differing in their degree of openness . It was the same Jesus who said , " Those who have ears to hear , let those persons hear . " He went on to say , " Take heed to what you hear and also take heed how you hear . " So I suggest that we not be quick to say , " This does n't fit , This is not part of my job . " The job description of a Christian is not written in advance . It may be recorded afterward , after a person has responded to the deed demanded . God acts through those who are open . DAVID PREUS , former president of the American Lutheran Church : My one word to you is ( as a Lutheran I have to use a text ) , Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many things , but especially , Live in the gospel . Remind yourself that you belong to Christ . And that 's why you are where you are . There 's no other way for a leader to gain the trust of the people whom he seeks to lead . And there 's no leading unless there are people who trust the leader . I remember that when I was a first-year pastor out in South Dakota I heard a Southern Baptist theological professor saying things I could n't imagine a Southern Baptist getting away with . Afterward I asked him , " How could you say those things back in Louisville or out on the hustings ? " And he said , " I always make sure to take five minutes to establish my credentials as one of God 's fools for Christ 's sake . And when I have done that , then I can say anything . " You have to credential yourself . And for me that little phrase describes how to credential yourself : Be fools for Christ 's sake . KARA NEWELL , former administrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold on to the discipline of centeredness . My mother is a potter , and I 've spent many happy hours watching her prepare the wet clay , plop a soggy lump of it on the wheel , start the wheel , and slowly draw the clay up into whatever form she has chosen . But I 've also watched her start the process over and over when she 's been unable to center the clay properly . Whatever comes from uncentered clay will not be usable . That 's true for us . Unless we become clay in the potter 's hands and allow ourselves to be centered , we will not be useful in the ways that we are called to minister . Some elements of the discipline of centering include being quiet and empty before the Lord regularly . Listening for a word from the Lord during that time . Praying regularly . Renewing one 's call in prayer . And focusing on ministry by learning from others , from those colleagues and partners in ministry who are mentors and examples . AVERY D. POST , for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since over the years I 've been occupied for the most part with Christian social action , with mission priorities and with ecumenism , I find it rather surprising that on this occasion I want to emphasize that it is absolutely necessary to find time and space to prepare . Prepare intellectually to achieve a global and sophisticated breadth . Prepare theologically to achieve a rearticulation of the faith in our time . Prepare physically to maintain wellness . Prepare relationally to achieve shared power and inclusivity . Prepare politically to touch all necessary bases and get the homework done . Prepare spiritually . And prepare to take risks , because risk-taking is an essential component of all authentic leadership . CLAIRE RANDALL , former general secretary of the National Council of Churches : Be ready to think new thoughts , do new things . Do n't just look back and try to do the same thing . Recognize that it is a new kind of world . The word " ecumenical " is now not just a churchly word ; it means everything in the world . You 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new connections we make with all our new kinds of communications , remember that the core of human nature is the same . Someone earlier quoted Paul , " Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought to think . " I can not stand in a room where women are mixed in as much as they are here without recalling that when I started out , if I had been in a group like this , I 'd probably have been the only woman  --  as I was for much of my career . So I want to say to you women what I would say to myself : Do think as highly of yourself as you ought to think . DORIS ANN YOUNGER , former general director of Church Women United : To be a church leader in this critical time you must be fully aware of the context in which you serve . I regret that I did not learn enough about the historical context of the organizations with which I worked . Take time to learn about the great inheritance , to learn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the current shift in the churches ' role in society  --  the diminishment of people and funds is very serious . The other context in which we serve is the sociological and political context . It 's so important to read your second-class mail . In church offices we get many pieces of literature from all kinds of groups , groups that keep us informed about issues that we do n't read about in the papers : the globalization of the church , the growth of our sister churches around the world while we are diminishing , the urgent problems of racism , sexism , ageism , homophobia , the problems relating to the gap between the rich and the poor . You are called not simply to carry on the tradition , but to be on the lookout for signs as to the shape the churches and the ecumenical agencies will take as we move into the 21st century . We have to continue to meet the needs of people for spiritual nourishment and community and to be a center for worship . And we must continue to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be risky work , full of stumbling blocks and frustrations . You have to learn to live with that , for you 're called not to bring in the kingdom , but to remain faithful . <p>
