AKIRA KUROSAWA 'S DREAMS Directed and Written by Akira Kurosawa <P> Death has always haunted Akira Kurosawa . How we face it and evade it , how we sometimes embrace it , and how we are sometimes granted temporary reprieves from it  --  these are matters he has taken up in almost all his movies , no matter what their other preoccupations . <P> That death therefore haunts his Dreams , his 28th film , is not surprising . In the first of these eight short narratives  --  all , according to the great director , drawn from incidents and images of his sleep  --  a child , obviously the young Kurosawa , is introduced to the idea of mortality . On a day both sunny and rainy , his mother warns him not to leave the house . In such weather foxes hold their weddings , and they take a terrible vengeance on those who spy on their secret ceremonies . Of course , the boy must see this woodland spectacle ( wonderfully realized by masked dancers ) and is himself seen . His mother then tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beg the creatures ' forgiveness . The episode closes with the child in search of the rainbow , under which the animals are said to live . <P> In the final episode , a lovely pastoral set in a village of water mills , a 103-year-old man explains the secret of longevity to the figure ( Akira Terao ) who is Kurosawa 's surrogate in six of these tales . In essence , he tells him to live in harmony with nature , avoiding the tempting conveniences of technology . But the night is so dark without electricity , the young man complains . " It 's supposed to be dark , " says the old fellow , who is last seen benignly dancing in a funeral procession . <P> Between first acknowledgment of mortality and this final acceptance of it , we see death attempting to lure a mountaineer lost in a blizzard ; we share the guilt of an army officer  --  the only member of his unit to survive the war -  --  as he confronts the ghosts of his fallen comrades ; we literally enter Van Gogh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin Scorsese ) indifferent to death , obsessed with capturing nature 's true spirit . In one of Kurosawa 's most magically told tales , a child is forced to confront his hidden feelings about his family 's carelessness in cutting down a peach orchard . It prefigures two later dreams ( rather conventionally apocalyptic , alas ) , about an atomic accident and about postnuclear life , in which the human family heedlessly destroys its entire world . <P> Kurosawa 's delicate but insistent linkage of individual fate with the world 's fate permits Dreams to avoid solipsism and grants it a certain cautionary urgency . What really compels one 's attention , however , is not what he is saying but how he is saying it . At 80 , Kurosawa , like many an older artist before him , is impatient with artifice ; he has long since proved himself a master of complex narrative . Now he wants to tell what he knows as simply as possible . There are no wild juxtapositions of the creatures of his sleeping world with the images of his waking world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same sensibility . The rhythms of his editing and his staging are serene  --  hypnotically so . His is not to shock us into surrendering to his visions but to seduce our consent to them . And this he does in one of the most lucid dreamworks ever placed on film .
