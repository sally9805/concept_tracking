What are those men doing , Chuck ? <p> Checking the level of contamination in the water . They 're going to run chemical analyses on the samples . Rumors are going around that there 's been an outbreak of some unusual disease . Some people say that it 's being caused by waste released from oceangoing ships . It 's all my employees can talk about this week . I called the Ministry of Health this morning , to get the straight dope on it and try to allay fears . You know how Fujimori 's ministers and their staff are masters of indirection and euphemism . Saniferal malfestations of seafoam . I always feel like they 're speaking Old Norse . They 're not sure at this point what to call it . <p> Any speculation ? <p> Cholera , maybe . But they do n't want the word to spread just yet . <p> Just the disease . Is n't cholera usually confined to livestock ? <p> It 's been pretty rare in these parts for a long time , I gather . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marine products , and posted signs on some of the beaches that prohibit swimming . I ca n't imagine who would want to swim this time of year anyway . It was low tide , and debris littered the beach , branches of kelp with . floaters like arthritic joints , fish heads , clam husks , the carcasses of crabs . Workers wearing oxygen masks wandered about the sand searing pieces of plankton and garbage with pointed sticks , depositing them in small plastic bags and tagging each . <p> Except you . Chuck 's the original polar bear , General . Every day at sunrise , he 's out in the pool , splashing around in the shallow end to wake himself up . The maid thinks he 's demented . Back when we lived in Boston , he used to try to coax me down to the harbor to recreate in early March , with promises of oysters on the half shell afterward . Why did you bring us to this ghastly beach for lunch ? This is supposed to be a special occasion , with Vic 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freezing to death . <p> This is the best restaurant on the whole Costa Verde . You 'd pay forty bucks a head in D.C. for a meal like you can get here . I ca n't help it if the entire coastline is a disaster area . <p> The maitre d ' stood by , discreetly rubbing the sandy sole of his oxford against the plank floor to get their attention . I hope everything is satisfactorily private for the Ambassador and his party I 'm at your disposal whenever you wish to inquire about any item on the menu . <p> I think we 're about ready , Romualdo . The diphthong on his father 's lips was perfect as a kiss , mua , as he switched into Spanish and pronounced Romualdo 's name . Have you made up some ceviche fresh this afternoon ? <p> Always fresh , sir . The prawns will be virtually gasping on your plate . <p> How about it , Vic ? You ever tried ceviche ? It 's raw shellfish marinated in lemon . A local delicacy . From the shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to roll in . The undertow sucked the waves back out almost before the whitecaps could break . Gusts blew through the cabana 's bamboo slats . Vic shivered in a summer suit , stylish and impossibly wrinkled , linen mottled with bright points of thread . <p> I do n't think we ought to be offering shellfish to our son , Chuck , or eating it ourselves , if the Ministry of Health has advised people to exercise caution . Those are bottom feeders . <p> The worst thing that can happen to this country right now is for a scare to start up about the seafood . None of these so-called health risks has even been confirmed yet , and I would certainly have been called in for the recitation of the whole Icelandic saga if there were anything definite to know . <p> Death is circumspect here in this city of ports , General Villanueva remarked , exhaling a puff and scanning the horizon with a squint . <p> I hope it stays circumspect . The economy depends heavily on the fishing industry , and even with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk eating out Several of the best seafood restaurants have already gone out of business as a result , and the whole thing could snowball . A country as poor as this one does n't need any more economic shocks , right after their first dose of Fujishock . I want you to know , Romualdo , that come what may , you can continue to count on seeing us here . I 'll throw any business your way that I can . <p> We appreciate your patronage , Ambassador . We always look forward to your proximate appearance . Finding a water stain on Vic 's knife , Romualdo burnished the utensil , making diversionary eye contact all the while . <p> Plus , there are all kinds of other things on the menu . Beef hearts on a skewer . Nobody at this table has to eat seafood if he does n't feel comfortable . I 'm not forcing anyone . <p> All right , then , I 'll try some of the seafood , but only for the sake of solidarity . I 'm not even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

The resulting entree is indescribably tender and exquisite . <p> O.K. , I 'll bite . How about you , Vic ? <p> I 'll have the beef tongue , please . Medium rare . <p> Would n't you prefer it a little more cooked , honey ? <p> That 's how I eat it . <p> O.K. , your funeral . General Villanueva ? <p> Whatever the senora is having . <p> Give me the ceviche , and bring us a couple of bottles of Chilean Chardonnay to start . <p> Are you all right , son ? You 're shaking , and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take me a few days to get acclimated . <p> Let 's move indoors , Chuck . It does n't even smell that fresh out here . You 'd think with the coastal wind we 'd at least get that . <p> I 'll buy a sweater tomorrow <p> The salt air out here will be salutary for him . But the beach is a disgrace , there 's no question about it . You see that kelp lying there rotting ? That 's what you smell . I was talking the other day to a young marine scientist down here working with the Ministry of Fisheries on a Fulbright . He 's doing a study , says that all that kelp , instead of uselessly decaying , could be harvested and put to use . Apparently it 's a natural source of iodine if you turn it to ashes . He 's proposing a massive water purification system using iodine extracted from kelp as its main active ingredient . It 's ecological , uses native resources , and if there is contamination in the ocean , it might squelch this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first I was skeptical , it sounded about as realistic as one of Vic 's off-the-cuff scientific hypotheses , but after hearing him out , I told him to send me a copy of the report , and that if it looked feasible , we 'd do whatever we could to promote it . As far as I 'm concerned , that 's the kind of thing we 're here for  --  to foster innovative thinking about these crises . Taking something that 's a social menace and turning it into a solution to the problem . Does n't it sound feasible to you , Vic ? You 've studied chemistry . Iodine has all kinds of medical applications , right ? You see , General , our son has spent tens of thousands of dollars dabbling in different courses in medical school , and devising amateur experiments in his ample spare time . Not to get a degree , of course , but so he can answer questions like this authoritatively . <p> Sweetheart , please do n't start . Vic has flown all this way to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a cheap shot . He took a long drink off his pisco sour . I just want him to know that I have my progressive side . I 'm not a reactionary puppet of the imperialist state , or whatever else men in my position are being called these days . <p> I did n't hear him call you anything of the kind , darling . <p> Well , he 's implied it clearly enough , with his sullen , adolescent refusal of the minor perquisites of power . It 's as though he 's ashamed of us . And plenty of other people are saying worse about me outright . The other day the head of the Internal Police showed me the latest issue of that student rag the Shining Path publishes at San Marcos University , which they 've also infiltrated . It refers to me as " the genocidal Featherston . " I 'd like to see them try to do my job . They ca n't even spell my name right . <p> They 're only kids . <p> Kids do n't blow up electrical towers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Somebody raked the wall of the compound with bullets again last week . <p> In broad daylight . And the Peruvian government subcontracts out to hire our security people , so I have absolutely no say in who is protecting your mother and me . It does n't make a person feel very secure Then the Shining Path , at least they claimed responsibility , blew up the storefront of the Kentucky Fried Chicken right up Avenida Arequipa , not twenty blocks from the compound . Give me a break . As if killing three innocent wage earners is really going to advance the proletarian cause . They probably did it because they suspect that Colonel Sanders is the name of a covert U.S. military advisor . <p> His beard alone would disqualify him from our domestic ranks , said the General . The military code tolerates mustaches , but frowns on beards <p> The ambassador downed another pisco sour as soon as the waiter set it in front of him , and the unmelted ice cubes left in the glass shone perfect as crystals of quartz . With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He seemed to have given up the losing battle of competing with General Villanueva 's erect posture . But we 're really glad to see you , son . You look fit . Been doing some running ? You could probably beat the general at tennis . I hardly ever can because I 'm too dissolute ; I bet I 've put on ten pounds since we arrived . Can you believe the physique on a guy his age ? He never touches anything but Earl Grey tea . At least have some wine with us this time , Villanueva . <p> It would be an honor , said the General . All in moderation . Let me take you to Club Regattas sometime , or the Circulo Militar . I notice from watching you pick up your glass that you are a leftist , like your father . I will have to take advantage of that defect by serving consistently to your backhand . A small stab at mirth on my part , as I hope you realize . My opinion is that all political differences should be worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camaraderie . <p> The military here is the most apolitical bunch of people I ever met . When it comes to the war on coca or anything else , they just execute the orders they 're given . They realized after the failure of Morales Bermudez , and the upsurge of Shining Path , that the hot seat of power was n't a very good place to be . General Villanueva , for instance , declined an official post in the ministry . He prefers to act as an unofficial advisor on the counterinsurgency . But what he 'd really rather do is read Conan Doyle and skunk me on the tennis courts . Is n't that right , Villanueva ? <p> I concur in your assessment of me . Without epaulets , one accomplishes more . But you are too modest about your own prowess on the clay . <p> So , how 's law school coming along ? <p> I finish this coming spring , and take the bar in September . That 's the plan , at least . <p> Fantastic . I was afraid to bring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Ambassador Featherson shifted forward in his iron garden chair . What specialty are you favoring ? Do you plan to clerk ? <p> Probably not . I kind of missed that opportunity . I 'd like to try straight off to do something with international law . With glasnost in the ascendant , there 's talk that there might be opportunities abroad for attorneys who speak fluent Russian . I want to get in the thick of someplace where history is being made , as soon as possible . <p> With all due respect , Young Vic , said the general , the Soviet Union continues to be socialist . Can one teach an old bear new cricks ? Ursa semper sinister est . And yet , Mrs. Thatcher did say she could do business with him . We could use some Thatcherismo ourselves . Too bad about the Falklands , though . Maggie 's great faux pas down here . They really ought to be called the Malvinas . <p> Not clerk ? What are you talking about ? You ca n't expect to get anywhere in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protocol nowadays , unless you simply plan to hash around . <p> I did n't say I wanted to work in Washington . That 's always been your idea . I may fly to the Soviet Union next month to have a look around and see what 's there . Somebody I know is negotiating with high-level officials in Moscow , about helping them finance the building of a new airport . He said he might get them to pay my airfare and lodging if I go along for a few weeks to translate technical documents and conversations , and advise him on some of the legal aspects of the joint project I 've always wanted to see Russia , I speak the language without ever having set foot in its borders , and it 's an incredible time to be over there . Legislators and legal scholars are actually redrafting the Soviet constitution right now , and I thought I might be able to get in on that , even in just an unofficial way . All kinds of arcane language has to be overhauled The link between insanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subclauses is like reading Dostoyevsky . <p> And how do you plan to be back in time for your exams , if you 're going to be overseeing Soviet affairs of state ? <p> I do n't have to be back . I took a leave of absence this semester I needed a break from law school . I 've been having  --  well , a little trouble keeping my concentration . My mind keeps wandering to other things . <p> So that 's how you managed to find leisure to travel here . I told your mother that mid-October seemed like an odd time for you to be coming You 're not cracking up , are you ? <p> Please do n't psychoanalyze me Why do you have to reduce everything to a mental aberration ? <p> I was against your visit , but she assured me that law schools have some kind of peculiar Gnostic calendar of their own . Not having had the advantage of attending one myself , I 'm not in a position to know And on top of it all , you fail to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't even extend our own son the courtesy of a limousine and driver on his first visit here . It 's embarrassing to us . Your mother was mortified when you showed up at the security gate in a taxi She 'd been waiting by the phone all morning . <p> Just lay off me , will you ? I did n't ask you to foot the bill for this trip or any other . Or my law school . So if I want to go to Russia , or to hell in a handbasket for that matter , I do n't know how that 's any concern of yours . <p> Where do you hatch these pathetically grandiose notions that you 're going to sweep in somewhere you 've never been and alter the course of history , the fate of humankind ? I hate to tell you , but that 's not how it works . Except for the uncombed shock of hair , you 're not Rasputin . Whatever megalomaniac fantasy you may have constructed in your mind , Gorbachev is not going to appoint you on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . World leaders do n't operate that way . O.K. , Reagan used psychics , but he 's in his dotage now , thank God . That 's probably how he chose my assignments back in the early eighties , come to think of it . I ca n't figure out any other explanation . But on the whole , civilization gets built and unbuilt stick by stick . When you get to be an elder statesman , then you can dispense wisdom . In the meantime , when are you going to get down to work like all the rest of us ? I 'd like to see you change one person 's life , just one , or even execute a specific order to satisfaction , then come back and talk to me about history . <p> The platters arrived , garnished with lettuce , tomato , and shreds of onion , and they ate without speaking , except for Vic 's mother reminding him not to eat the lettuce , as the men in oxygen masks drifted further down the beach , brandishing their spears . Uncorked wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses in spite of the maitre d 's repeated attempts to beat him to the bottle . The general dabbed at his mouth with delicacy and returned the napkin to his lap . All this talk of lawyers by the seaside reminds me of a joke I heard not too long ago from a good friend of mine , a former colonel whom I recently visited in San Francisco . We lost contact , because he was living under an assumed name there after he was spuriously charged , on minor legal technicalities , with various crimes against humanity for his participation in the Argentine junta . But they found him out , alas , and are now trying to extradite him to stand trial , poor fellow . In the face of all this harassment , he somehow retains his sense of humor . Ahead , death lurks patiently in the barrels of the guns . And yet he remains stoical . He said there were three professionals out fishing in a boat  --  a doctor , a priest , and a lawyer . A squall blew up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond repair . They decided amongst themselves that one of them would have to try to swim to shore for help , but the waters were known to be infested with sharks , and none of them was anxious to volunteer . I should n't be the one to go , said the doctor . If we all fall sick , as we eventually shall , then the two of you will require my medical services . All the more reason why I should n't go , said the priest . If we do indeed sicken , we may end up on the point of death , and the two of you will need me to perform your last rites . They sat in silence for a while , no one budging , until at last the lawyer stood up , smiled at his companions and said , Do n't worry , I 'll go . He stepped off the side of the boat , and before his feet were able to touch even a single drop of water , two sharks leapt out of the ocean , one under each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a miracle cried the priest . No , said the doctor , shaking his head . Professional courtesy . <p> Funny , Villanueva . I had n't heard that one . <p> I have an idea . Maybe it would be good for Vic to use these couple of months off to get some practical , hands-on experience . He could stay here with us and help represent the Thomases in their adoption case . The final papers would have to be signed by a degreed attorney , but there 's no reason why he ca n't help them through the legal hurdles . He knows far more than any paralegal , even if you take into account that this is a different context , and he speaks good Spanish . The Thomases have been down here five months , and their case has gotten nowhere , even with my intervention . They need somebody who has the time to stick with them day by day . This would n't be anything stressful . Just something to keep your mind occupied while you rest and recuperate . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's latest crusading passions <p> Bill and Hannah . He 's a carpenter in the States , and she 's an interior design person . They rehab Victorians in the Midwest and live in them until they sell . A childless couple who are dying to have a baby . I know they 'll be impeccable parents , if they can just get their hands on a child . They tried for months , then resorted to fertility drugs and finally conceived , but the baby was born with all kinds of complications , and then liver failure , and they could n't find a donor in time , so the baby died . After that , she could n't seem to conceive again , and they 've been on an adoption waiting list in the States forever . It 's one of the real classic horror stories . <p> What are they doing down here <p> The Peruvian government has set up incentives for citizens who want to give up their children for adoption . The birth rate is at panic levels . Birth control is n't a real option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that goes , and the shantytowns are exploding in every direction . You surely noticed them on your way in from the airport . Tawantinsuyo , Villa Hermosa . Gigantic  --  whole colonies unto themselves . I 've been out to visit a couple of them and , as a mother , it makes my heart sick . There might be one running faucet for every three hundred people , and the infant mortality rate is unbelievable . The babies are all dying of diarrhea . I hate to think what 's going to happen in those places if we really are on the verge of a cholera epidemic . It 's fine to tell people to wash their hands and make sure the baby stays hydrated , but it 's a little tough to do when hardly anybody has potable water . It makes me tremble to try to imagine what it would have been like to raise you in an environment like that . <p> So basically they 're selling children to the first world to alleviate the problem ? <p> I know what you 're thinking , son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensatory fee by the adopting couple . But the applicants are all screened very carefully , as they would be anywhere . We 're not talking child slave trade . The only people making real money off this are the lawyers . That 's what troubles me . A whole corps of shysters has sprung up , including , in my opinion , this one representing the Thomases . They string the adoption process out forever , and milk the hopeful couples , most of whom do n't even speak the language , of every cent they possibly can while leading them by the nose through a maze of regulations The foreign hopefuls camp out in hotels here for weeks or even months , waiting to get approved . Occasionally the babies are delivered over to them by desperate mothers before the paperwork is through , and these would-be adoptive parents have to call room service for thermoses of hot water , which get put on their growing hotel tab , so they can sterilize bottles . They bathe their new infants in a hotel sink , without even knowing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them return to the U.S. without anything to show for the ordeal except the gouge marks in their life savings . It 's an imperfect system , inhumane really , to everybody concerned , but you could help soften the blows , at least in this case . I 'm especially concerned about Hannah and Bill , because they 're just working people , really nice , who have been to hell and back trying to get a baby of their own . You would think they would n't have to go through any more suffering . He said that the day before yesterday they were sitting in the Cine Orrantia watching a kung-fu movie , dubbed in Spanish , at two in the afternoon , killing time , and he suddenly thought about where he was , and what he was doing , and thought he was going to go insane . What do you think , Chuck ? <p> I think Vic should be back in law school , finishing his degree . But since he 's already taken a leave of absence , I 'd rather see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traipsing off half-cocked to the Soviet Union . He 's already here , so I guess we can give it a try . <p> How about it , Vic ? <p> Vic chewed the succulent piece of steak in his mouth . The chef had cooked the tongue to perfection  --  tender and not too done , just shy of bloody . He was feeling anemic after the long flight , and could use the iron . I do n't know . I 'm pretty strung out right now . Maybe we can discuss it further tomorrow . I 've got a horrible case of jet lag , and I feel one of my insomnia binges coming on . I 'd like to nip it in the bud . Tonight , I 'm going to be really decadent , and sleep for twelve hours . Do n't anybody wake me in the morning , O.K. ? <p> II <p> Let me pour you some more tea . Demetrio , please fix us another pot , would you ? Young Vic has a little stomach problem . His mother spoke Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be described as fair to middling . She had never possessed an ear , a natural musical gift , like his father 's , but her grammar was absolutely correct down to the last suffix , her subjunctives and imperfects always cultivated to perfection She lifted the tea cozy from the ceramic pot , poured Vic another cup of chamomile , and handed the empty pot to Demetrio . This stuff grows in the garden . I stick whole stalks and flowers in . You can buy all kinds of medicinal herbal teas in the marketplace . I 've never even heard of some of them I have a few packets wrapped up in newspaper in the kitchen cabinet , but I do n't know exactly what they 're for . The cook does n't either , or if she does she 's not letting on . <p> On the whole , Sandy tended to go native , to throw herself as entirely as possible into learning the customs , history , cuisine , furniture , architecture , language , of each place she inhabited for short stretches of two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ambassador 's wife at its stated official value , attending Women 's Days , elementary-school parades with patriotic fanfare , off-key and fortissimo , the openings of gallery shows devoted to local up-and-coming artists , especially those with a flair for indigenous themes . She hosted the requisite number of official dinners for state dignitaries , and attended her share of opera premieres . Sandy much preferred , though , what she called , with the slangy aplomb of Evita , " the real thing or at least a good cheap imitation . " Moving , for her , did not entail transporting a cargo hold of steamer trunks filled with Wedgwood and table linens at taxpayer expense , or having a pongo haul a meat freezer up a mountainside on his back . On the whole , she 'd given away the acquisitions of each phase before leaving the country in question , keeping back only a few sentimental favorites for herself : an Ibo mask carved in the uncanny likeness of a high school beau she had always referred to as El Greco , or a chador given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who underneath the black robes they donned in public , wore brilliant Christian Dior dresses seen only by their husbands and other women in the group , The bulk of Sandy 's shipped items consisted of an ever-growing collection of books . But to each of the countries they 'd lived in while Vic was growing up and after , she 'd brought along a few constant and unchanging necessities , such as the tea cozy and the ceramic pot Vic recognized from childhood , to keep her civilized , as she always said in a voice that could be either ironic or sincere , depending on how you chose to take it . <p> Now he was drinking from that teapot in unfamiliar surroundings once again . The two-story villa and timbered ceilings and a sloping clay roof ( a luxury of strictly aesthetic value in a city where it never rained , she explained to him ) The walls and patio around the swimming pool were inlaid with genuine Spanish tile , aquamarine , hand painted with what looked to be scenes from an illustrator she guessed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guaman Poma de Ayala . He watched her move about the spacious rooms with obvious pleasure , as she apologized for the obscenely long trestle table , made of heavy oak and surrounded by high-backed throne chairs . She complained of the villa 's having been furnished in Late Conquistador , assuring him that she and his father always ate in the kitchen or out on the patio unless they were entertaining local or foreign brass . <p> Beyond the swimming pool lay her secret garden , its walking paths lined with peonies , roses , carnations , other flowers he did n't recognize , lemon grass , crooked shade trees , all heavily irrigated . A hose ran uninterrupted . The two of them had spent a twilit half-hour kneeling in the damp grass , searching without success for the phantom house mascot while humidity evanesced close to the ground , the outermost reach of the moist breath exhaled by the earth 's molten core . The tortoise in question had been presented to her and the Ambassador as a ceremonial gift by the head of a jungle tribe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire cage in the hold of a Faucett Jet to be set free in Sandy 's hothouse locus amoenus . It disappeared at once into the dank vegetation , and had n't shown its leather face since . Demetrio , the butler , was the same way . He made himself present when called for to perform a specific service , such as bringing tea , but otherwise vanished into one of the many bone-chilling rooms . <p> The villa had an actual study , in the old-fashioned sense of the word , one with deep chairs , a working fireplace piled with fast-burning and aromatic eucalyptus , the only readily available wood , and plenty of shelf space crammed with books . Vic had already decided on it as his preferred room , and had spent the early morning hours stoking the fire with branches , watching the leaves on them flare , shrivel , and fall into the deepening bed of ashes . None of the shelves housed sets of tomes with oppressive leather bindings and uncut pages , of the kind one found in the bad Southern romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waugh 's Decline and Fall was there , Tennyson , Plato , Euripides , but most of the shelf space was dominated by hard-used paperbacks in languages both classical and declasse . Here was something called Gregorio Condori Mamani , the oral autobiography of a campesino who had devoted his life to carrying bundles on his back , with a rope , in an Andean marketplace . That much Vic could glean by skimming the Spanish . <p> The Quechua text on the facing page remained runic and impenetrable . Last night , he 'd given up on his tax-law textbook , and studied the Indian language by the vacillating lamplight in the guest room . ( I hope it 's not another electrical tower blown by the guerrillas , his mother had said , poking her head in the door , but here 's a flashlight just in case . ) Before long , his eyes watery , he began to experience odd , vaguely nauseating twinges of remorse in the pit of his stomach about having come home at all to this most recent of homes .

They were traitors both to their native class and their adopted class . I came here from my birthplace when I realized that I had no mother and no father . I was a complete orphan , poor , given over into the hands of my godmother . She sheared my hair , and one day , when I had come of a certain age , she said to me : Now that you 've hoarded some strength , and your bones are starting to harden , you must go find work .

His hair was dark , thick and coarse , and his cheekbones salient , almost Asiatic , the same racial characteristics Vic had observed in many of the people at the airport and in the street . But Demetrio also had reddish highlights to his hair , and freckles . His eyes were green , too , or more of a hazel , really . Demetrio set down the tea service , straightened , and fastened his greenish gaze on the mistress 's son So , you 're Young Vic . We 've all been hearing a great deal about you , and waiting breathlessly for your arrival . <p> Well , here I am .

My father died in prison a few years back . <p> I 'm sorry to hear that . What from ? <p> Unknown causes . Possibly an outbreak of socialism . But before that , he was a local actor who studied abroad for a year at the Old Vic . The English wanted to have some third-world ethnic types around  --  perhaps because Shakespeare 's plays are full of blokes named Gonzago . So they gave out a few fellowships , and he happened to get one . I 'm the fruit of that fellowship .

Demetrio vanished again like the Cheshire cat , only his faint overbite and green eyes left glinting in the doorway . <p> Drink the tea before it gets cold . Sandy laid the back of her hand against Vic 's brow . Have your bowel movements started to return to normal ? My stomach 's still a little loose , and I 'm limp as a rag , but at least I 'm not speaking melancholy Danish into the toilet bowl any more . And doing other equally disgusting things . I do n't think there 's much left inside me . Did I keep Dad awake all night with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that journalist from El Comercio , and take a nap this afternoon . The man never prints what he says anyway . He makes up his own quotes and arranges them in interview format , so I 'm not sure what he needs Chuck for . <p> I guess you did n't sleep much either , coming in to give me water and hold my head . I 'm really sorry . <p> Sorry ? Sorry for what ? <p> You know . It 's all so gross . Dealing with my bodily fluids I kept hoping I would die and have a closed-casket service , so I would n't have to look you in the eye again . I really wish I 'd checked into a hotel . At least nobody would have known me . I could have listed my profession as land surveyor in the register . <p> What sort of nonsense are you talking ? I 'm your mother . When something like that hits you , you can get dehydrated in a critical way , before you even know what 's happening . I should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm only glad we had enough bottled water on hand . I happened to send Chela out to stock up yesterday , on account of your arrival . Otherwise you would have been drinking a case of Inka Cola instead . Speaking of sleep , you could n't have got more than half an hour yourself . Why do n't you go lie down ? <p> No , I 'm not sleepy anymore . The wave passed . Besides , I 'd rather hang out here in the study with you . This is the one room I really like . Whatever it was that hit me , I do n't feel much like moving around . <p> At first I was certain your symptoms had to do with this cholera thing . You ca n't imagine what a scare you gave me . I had Chuck wake up the staff doctor over at the Embassy . He did n't seem terribly worried about it . Then I remembered that you 'd ordered beef tongue . You should have eaten the fish ; all the rest of us seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe it was trichinosis  --  do you get that from beef ? <p> Pork . <p> Well , everybody seems to be catching livestock diseases these days You probably just came down with a quick case of Montezuma 's Revenge . That 's what you get for being the son of the genocidal Featherston , sic . Your father and I have already gone through all the local bugs . Or mostly me , I should say . You know how Chuck never succumbs to anything . <p> I do feel a lot better . <p> Good enough to go shopping for a sweater this afternoon ? There 's a tourist shop I want to take you to . Quality goods , not this cheap stuff crowding the stores on La Colmena . Beatriz , the woman who runs it , has become the unofficial godmother to a lot of the adoptive couples who end up hanging around here while they 're waiting for their babies . It gives them somewhere to drink coffee and commiserate . <p> You know , Mom , I was considering your proposition last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's something I should get involved in . I need to withdraw for a week or two . Anyway , the legal system here is completely unfamiliar to me . It 's based on the Napoleonic code , is n't it ? <p> It ca n't be any more difficult than helping rewrite the Soviet constitution . And I know it would give your father a lot of pleasure , even if he did n't say so directly . <p> Why ca n't he say it directly , if that 's what he thinks ? Why do you always end up serving as his intermediary and interpreter , to soften his sarcastic remarks ? You have your own life to live , without the extra pressure of tending to his . I thought he was the one who is supposed to be the ambassador , spreading goodwill throughout the world and functioning as the go-between . <p> He has a very full schedule , and he sees to it admirably . <p> I do n't know how conscientious a job he can be doing here , in the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's put on weight , and he 's drinking far too much . Did you see him put the booze away at lunch ? He looks at least five years older than he did the last time I saw him . <p> Please do n't make him into the drunken consul in Under the Volcano , son . You 've been known to exaggerate for effect . Pretty soon you 'll have him hanging upside down by his ankles in a Mexican Ferris wheel with his keys and change falling out of his trouser pockets . While little children gather up the scattered coppers on the ground . <p> It 's your allusion , not mine . And it does n't seem that far off the mark . <p> Vic , do n't insult my intelligence or your father 's . He 's been under incredible pressure since we arrived here . Do you know what it 's like to try to sleep at night , when bombs are going off in the vicinity every couple of weeks ? Fujimori 's very secretive and has appointed a dummy cabinet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't always even know if you 're dealing with the right person . He likes to have several " teams , " as he calls them , for everything . He probably uses a stunt double for his public appearances . Besides , all of the diplomatic assignments your father has been given , even before this one , were to hard places at dangerous times  --  Kuwait , Nigeria , Nicaragua . For better or worse , he strictly an organization man , a bureaucrat , and not an ideologue . He did n't come through the old-boy network , and for that reason the Republicans do n't really like him . He does n't submit his country assignment preferences on the basis of the number of available golf courses per square mile . He came up through the ranks , taking the foreign-service exam , without any of the advantages But he 's a senior diplomat , so they give him assignments that look good on paper , but that none of the cronies really want anyway . <p> And I 've had all the advantages . He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be satisfied until I cop a government post myself . Only not too big of one , because he could n't stand to be one-upped . <p> Vic , listen to yourself . You 're talking about your father . <p> O.K. That was my cheap shot . I take it back . I still do n't like the way you get dragged around the world , though . I know you 're sick of it . You 've told me so before in your letters . You should be a university professor somewhere , teaching English literature and explaining to students what a bailiwick and a barouche landau are . I would have killed to find a teacher as smart as you . Instead , you 're having lunch on a garbage-strewn beach with General Villanueva . <p> You 're just mad because he told a lawyer joke . <p> Told to him in turn by the Butcher of Buenos Aires . I 'm sorry , but that guy gives me the creeps . I ca n't believe Dad plays tennis with him . It does n't make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Villanueva myself , I 'll confess , but it 's not for me to judge . I try to be polite . They 're both involved in overseeing the military aid that 's getting funneled into the war on drugs and the counterinsurgency . The administration is putting lots of pressure on all the ambassadors down here in Latin America to take a hard line on drug production That 's why we flew to Iquitos last month . I went bird-watching and your father visited captured cocaine factories . There 's some huge aid package pending in Congress , and the money 's all mixed up together . I do n't really know the ins and outs of it myself . My domain is slightly different . <p> How do you stand that ? You 're in it , but you 're not of it . I try to keep my fellow students at law school from even knowing that I 'm the son of the Peruvian ambassador , because they expect me to have a privileged and cogent take on what 's going on down here politically . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have the slightest idea , or not any more of one than they do . That I only speak to my father once or twice a year , and even then it 's usually to argue about money that I owe somebody or other . But for you , it 's worse . You attend one social and cultural function after another , and entertain the people who make the policies . You get facts and snippets , rumors , form your hypotheses , but without knowing the whole picture . And then you 're supposed to help relocate all the displaced orphans . I know that my questions are probably naive as hell , but why does n't Congress appropriate some of that money to put running water in those shantytowns you were telling me about ? Have you asked Dad to request that they do that ? <p> I ca n't tell your father what to do , Vic , any more than you can . You know how reticent he can be . Our philosophies are not precisely the same either , as I 'm sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent here to implement foreign policy , not to make it . He has a certain narrow latitude , on a day-to-day basis , but he prefers to exercise it with caution . That probably seems like a conservative approach to you , but it starts to sound pretty appealing after you listen to some of the junket cowboys who come down here , have a few whiskies with us by the pool , and start wondering aloud why we do n't just nuke the hell out of these slums and take care of the problem that way . They always meant it as a joke , of course , when I inquire whether the Congressman 's remarks are to be construed as on or off the record . They 'd have us using Agent Orange in the Peruvian jungle if they thought they could get away with it . <p> Well , I certainly ca n't judge the situation any better than you can . I really just came down here to spend a little time with you , and recharge my batteries . I used the student loan for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to revoke the loan and stick a hefty penalty on me when I get back . I 'm glad that the university does n't have a brig , because I 'd spend all my time in it . <p> You 're hopeless , Vic . I wish you would find somebody to keep you on the straight and narrow . I do n't suppose there 's any chance of your getting back together with Felicia . She was so bright and serious . An intellectual like you . You should n't hold it against her that she came from Brahmins . I know you could n't stand to be tainted with blue blood , on top of being an ambassador 's son . But if it will make you feel any better , a Brahmin is also a breed of cattle , you know . Even cows have pedigrees . It has a hump between the shoulders , and a pendulous dewlap . You could tell people she 's a rodeo cowgirl , or a veterinarian . Or that she works in a freak show . <p> I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectations about things . Anyway , that was long ago . <p> I suppose you 're still seeing that Andrea girl . <p> Your tone of voice tells me that you may yet be withholding a drop or two of approval . <p> I liked her quite well the time I met her in Boston . I found her positively  --  charming . <p> That 's the most noncommital , nondescript , diplomatic adjective you could have selected . <p> I know Andrea is smart , in her own way , but if you want me to be blunt , she struck me as a bit too much of the California golden girl . She 's even tawny . I simply think that you need someone more ambitious and less frivolous . She 's doubtless a delicious find for most any healthy young male , including yourself , but I ca n't imagine that it 's going to last . <p> That 's my affair . O.K. ? End of discussion . In any event , I do n't think I 'm in much of a position to be judging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The problem is that it shoots out of your pores in every direction , wreaking carnage , like Saint Sebastian 's arrows in reverse . Do you understand how close you keep coming to messing up your life for good ? <p> I agree . That 's why I do n't think I 'd be a very good choice for shepherding this couple through their troubles . It 's the blind leading the blind . <p> Vic , please help me out on this . I need someone I can put my trust in , and I 've seldom asked anything of you . The things I do may seem useless or strange , from your vantage point , and it 's true that I do on occasion complain about them . Every task I perform here is based on half-truths , partial knowledge spoken in whispers at the bottom of a well . But an ambassador 's wife is what I am , son . That 's my life . I wield mandarin courtesies that I 've spent my existence honing to razor sharpness I ca n't sit here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All I can manage is to exercise my peculiar , rarefied little domain of social clubs and the wives of prominent citizens in the best way I know how And right now , what I want more than anything is for the Thomases to take possession of that baby waiting for them in Tawantinsuyo . That 's something I can actually make happen . It 's a task that 's manageable enough to see through to the end . I even have dreams about it . When they told me their story , I felt as sad as if I had been the one to watch my child die . As if I 'd lost you for all time , and could never live through the experience of holding you in my arms when you 're weak and sick and limp , and in spite of the fact that you 're twenty-eight years old , still be able to hear you cry out in the middle of the night Mama , Mama help me I think I 'm dying . You gave me a real scare . I thought I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered that I 'm not quite ready to do that . <p> In this manner , she spoke to him . And he said : All right , Mama . <p> III <p> They chose to have the driver leave them at the corner of Camana and La Colmena , but within two minutes had reason to regret their decision . The moneychangers thronged about Sandy and Vic , brandishing solar calculators the size of credit cards , holding them heavenward so the digital display would receive the maximum exposure to the winter sun 's rays , as they babbled hypothetical equations of intis to dollars , in thousands , tens of thousands , some running off like auctioneers on ether into the millions , or turning the calculators askew so that they flashed an endlessly repeating decimal , 6666666 or 8888888 . As she and he pushed their way up the block , still more people milled about with placards lettered by hand . At first Vic feared a protest had formed on short notice . He did n't know whether or not his mother 's face recognition and perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , whether she was serving as a second-string lightning rod for wrath about a recent visit by the IMF , or the coca policy , or the changes taking place in Czechoslovakia . But the signs all pertained to currency exchange , pure and simple . I ACCEPT TORN TAPED STAPLED BURNT RIPPED DOLLARS . BUY OR SELL ALL THE SAME TO ME . <p> She took him by the arm with surprising strength , and using her elbow as a rudder , hustled him through the gauntlet with her head down , as if they were attending a rowdy political rally and she wanted to keep him from being assassinated . He felt instinctively that if someone had in fact begun sniping , she would have thrown her body across his without hesitation to receive the bullets herself . She was not the type to be left a grieving mother or widow . At length they came out on a wide plaza , where carts were set up everywhere to sell slabs of cake iced with brilliant pink dots of hard sugar . A man was performing a frenetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of a sheet , his back to it as he sang its praises , hunkering down and leaping outward to shout the scissors ' virtues to a group of bystanders , black , Hispanic , Indian , mulatto , mestizo . Many of the bystanders were dressed in purple , one or two wearing cowls . Two or three spectators would move off , and two or three more would take their places . The piles of painted wooden Jesuses arrayed on blankets had crowns of thorns so sharp they looked like coils of barbed wire wrapped tightly about the bleeding heads . <p> The Lord of Miracles , said his mother . A Negro religious festival . In the past few years , since they really invaded the capital , the Indians have been trying to compete by putting forth their own saint . Some housemaid who migrated to Lima and got murdered , and whom they 've made into the most recent martyr , one of their own . But a lot of the Quechuas attend this celebration too . It seems like the religious festivals are getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same space . Under a crumbling portico , they entered an elevator , shut the collapsible iron gate and ascended with creaks and bangs . <p> The artisan shop did indeed carry quality goods : no rugs with llamas fluffy as French poodles , or hammered tin plates , thin as aluminum foil , with squat , priapic gods in their center ( they 're called Tumis , said his mother ) , like he ones lining the windows of the shops they had passed It was mostly textiles : sweaters , ponchos and dresses , handmade or machine-made , all with tight weaves regardless , the designs plausibly traditional but dyed in vivid continuums of colors : mauve , tangerine , ice blue , magenta , very few rustic browns and whites . The weave too , looked Scandinavian , nearly identical to that of the Icelandic sweaters his mother had always bought him as a boy on her trips to Europe . Now he was being ushered into a second room , introduced to an anthropologist , then a couple from Wichita , gregarious and nervous , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand in a Masonic death grip , the fingerwork complicated and ambiguous , perhaps he was just clumsy , all signet rings and signifying eyebrows . No , they were n't the Thomases but they 'd met them , all the childless gringos become one in-group over time ; their problems were so similar that they 'd developed their own little forms of understanding . And here was Beatriz , the owner of the shop , in her turtleneck using a long-handled hook to unhang a slinky black dress , calf length , with a sort of indigenous Keatsian frieze at the bottom , ancient marathoners ( they 're called Chasquis , said his mother ) running a relay along the hem . <p> Beatriz gestured them toward the coffee , senora Featherson knew where it was , and what a handsome son , ay , que guapito , un rubio todavia , as she gave explicit instructions to her assistant about just where to lay hold of the dress so as not to wrinkle it . Kisses were exchanged all around , if they could be called that , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Wichita couple , the only other male besides Vic in attendance , seemed to be permitted to make actual contact with his lips on the women 's cheeks , and Vic followed his lead without occasioning any looks of reproval . Had Bill and Hannah been in yet ? Sandy wanted to know . <p> No , they usually dropped by about this time , regular as clockwork , the woman from Wichita explained ; living here had n't made them abandon their punctuality for hora peruana ; if anything it had reinforced it But they 'd taken to staying in their hotel a little more lately She herself had regressed for a while last week , and gone on a binge at the Estadio Nacional , buying from a street vendor fried donuts dripping with chancaca honey , It had been a flagrant but unconscious suicidal gesture on her part ; she 'd had a premonition of death when she 'd suddenly noticed the flower stands all about her overflowing with lilies , but she 'd survived her indiscretion and was there to be supportive of the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely would . <p> Another couple had entered the shop , and were absently turning over a stack of patterned cloth tapestries as if they were leafing through a foreign newspaper , Cyrillic perhaps , whose signs and symbols they failed to grasp . Oh , here they are , said Sandy . Bill and Hannah , I 'd like you to meet my son Vic . Each in turn offered a hand shyly , and endured being kissed on the cheek by everyone in the room . Bill did n't return the kisses . They had obviously not grown accustomed to that habit , the casually invasive closeness of alien bodies , and seemed to find it a painful ritual . The two exchanged only a few words with Vic , and then buffered themselves in the relative comfort of their familiarity with the Wichita couple . <p> Did they know or suspect that this meeting with Vic was an assignation ? His mother had n't been very clear on that point . Maybe it embarrassed them to have their story trotted out unbidden to every newcomer , to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily gossip and speculation . He could n't help observing that the woman 's hips looked slight , boyish , and the husband , though not tall , bordered on being musclebound ; he had the physique of a hod carrier . Had the baby been extra large , and the delivery painful ? A woman 's pelvic bone , so he 'd learned in med school , unlocked during labor , allowing a more comfortable passage , but it all somehow remained for him in the realm of conjecture . He 'd seen his niece in the newborn nursery after Priscilla gave birth , the head distressingly elongated in the crib . The nurse had told him , redundantly , that the skulls remained soft and flexible to help them squeeze through the narrow canal , that was why it had that deformed look to it at first , but the skull would return to a more normal shape in time . He 'd taken a wait-and-see attitude . <p> Sandy had collared Hannah and Bill , and was guiding them toward the wooden balcony outside , motioning for Vic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Lord of Miracles , borne aloft , had rounded the corner from a side street and was making his way , by fits and starts , around the perimeter of the plaza . A full story in height , the icon had been swathed in purple finery , and the attached baubles and gaudy mirrors  --  or gold and priceless jewels , it was hard to tell just what they were  --  refracted light . Streaks of blood adorned every portion of his body . He looked as though he 'd been bullwhipped , and with teeth bared beneath the beard , and the crown of thorns as gargantuan as the nest of a prehistoric bird , he was a feast of agony . The faithful supported him on a pallet with long , stout beams on either side so that he could be carried through the streets Under each corner of the body , a crowd of men strained at the section of beam laid across their shoulders , knees buckling under the immense weight . They would lurch forward a couple of steps , and then regroup to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in ecstasy or in pain , and others were shouting instructions and encouragement from the sidelines as they thronged alongside the palletbearers . Loudspeakers strung on lampposts echoed with details of the resurrection . From the grills serving skewered beef hearts , smoke issued in thick puffs . Bottles of beer circulated , each man taking a long pull until he frothed at the mouth . In a fluctuating cordon , the helmeted police edgily contained the crowd from spilling over into the one thoroughfare not choked with devotees . The ornate colonial carving of the balcony Vic watched from blended with other irregular gashes and splinterings in the wood that looked suspiciously like the work of termites . Or maybe the balcony had been shattered by a bullet many years before , and never repaired . Some president or other had probably stood in the same spot once with a sash across his chest , awaiting the inauguration . Weeping women on the other wooden balconies around the plaza flung fistfuls of confetti at the Lord of Miracles as he passed beneath them . <p> At last , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can talk in private . You do n't need to worry about anything . Vic is going to help you get your baby . <p> IV <p> The catacombs yawned beneath the corridor in which they walked . Pits of impossible depth , seen from above , had piles of bones lying at the bottom . Depending on how far down the pits ran , the bones might reach halfway up , making a layer of skeletons twenty or thirty feet deep , The skulls had turned so black and dry that it was difficult to connect them to anything human . And there were so many of them . Vic could n't imagine where they 'd all come from . The brochure was sketchy on that point . It had much more to say about the Sevillian tilework , the Jose de Rivera paintings , the gold monstrance set with jewels , and the paneled ceilings in the cloisters that he and the Thomases had just descended from . A baroque church with Arabic influences , finished 1674 , under reconstruction . Parts of it closed off . Catacombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some moment in history ? An attempt at racial extirpation during the religious conversions ? Or had they just kept tossing the skeletons in one and two at a time , year after year , over centuries ? <p> We 've been meaning to see these since we got here . Neither of us has traveled that much , just Yellowstone , the Smokies , that sort of thing . <p> Yeah , who would have ever thought we 'd end up in South America ? I saw a documentary on the Incas once , on the educational channel when I was flipping around . But that 's about it . I wish we at least spoke the language . The natives seem friendly enough , but you ca n't really tell , I think , unless you can talk to them in their own lingo . I walk around on the street feeling fatheaded . <p> The Thomases had insisted on having Vic walk through the catacombs ahead of them . When he 'd invited them to spend the day taking in some of the sights , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to give them a chance to speak their minds at leisure . But they seemed determined to seize the opportunity to show the infinite confidence they had placed in his abilities . The meager brochure provided for the churches was in Spanish , and he had translated from it at their request , answering their countless questions as best he could . He explained to them repeatedly that he 'd never been to Lima before either , and had no knowledge whatsoever about any of the places they were seeing . But they knew otherwise . The more he pleaded ignorance , the more convinced they became that he was displaying false modesty , and the harder they pressed for particulars . <p> The Thomases had inquired all about the architecture of the cathedral , and had shown even more interest in the sections that were closed off and under renovation . Through Vic 's intercession , and a small donation by him to the building fund , the sacristan had consented to let them wander beneath the scaffolding beyond the rope , noticing details and admiring the apparent solidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't get masonry like this anymore , said Bill . They had some good workers back then . I wish I could find somebody half this conscientious for the jobs I subcontract out . I work like a coolie myself , but I can hardly get the masons to stick around late even when I pay them overtime . <p> Now , in the midst of their descent into the subterranean catacombs , they were beginning to tire . It was late afternoon , the hour of low blood sugar and self-doubt . After spending their final fit of enthusiasm on the architecture above , they had begun to sink back into the lethargy of the previous day . Below ground , the air was stale and close , heavy with a mineral scent . They rested on the earth steps of a dark corridor lit with a string of dim bulbs . The husband sat on the step below his wife , and she , above , devoted herself to tearing out the errant tag in the collar of his shirt . Vic had played it low-key , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . It was their baby , in every sense of the word , and he had no wish to make it his . His father would soon see that Vic could , indeed , execute a specific order to satisfaction , if left to do it in his own way and in his own time . The Thomases had to understand first that he was not their rescuer . He would execute rather than interpret , fulfill his simple , ordained , minor part in this drama as quickly as possible , and get the hell out of Lima before his mother could assign him any further tasks . This was not what he had come for . <p> But as the matter at hand remained unspoken of throughout the course of the day , he could sense their silent expectations rising . He needed to make clear to them the limits on what he could be expected to accomplish . The conversation with their attorney , Mr. Covarrubia , had n't been very illuminating . The man showed Vic document after document , each one bearing far too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in smudgy type with lots of raised letters , the headings at the top of each page featuring cryptic sayings in caps : " YEAR OF AUSTERITY , " " YEAR OF RECLAIMING THE SOUTHERN LITTORAL , " " YEAR OF THE FREEZE-DRIED POTATO " Mr. Covarrubia obviously resented Vic 's injection into the proceedings , especially after he found out Vic did n't actually have a degree . And the decrepit , windowless office , with its deeply scarred desk , plus the people who kept coming over to borrow his pen  --  apparently the only one in the place that worked  --  did n't inspire Vic 's confidence in Mr. Covarrubia either . Nor did he appreciate the attorney 's habit of constantly and testily referring to Vic as joven , instead of by his name . <p> Yet Covarrubia did n't seem to be withholding any information , as far as Vic could tell . It looked as though he had gone through all the appropriate steps so far . Though not inspired , the attorney was competent . The only incriminating thing was that each step had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the most efficient judges kept getting assassinated by the Shining Path . And the mother of the baby , one Anastasia Wamani , keeps changing her story . He handed Vic the file . After leafing through it , Vic tried to give the file back , but the attorney held up his hand . Oh , no . It 's yours now . <p> The Thomases still had n't brought up the matter of adoption in the course of the outing by the time Vic led them into the San Francisco Church . When the sacristan had casually mentioned that for another small donation , this time to the charity fund , the catacombs too could be opened , Vic had n't hesitated . He gave the man an unambiguously large tip , and let him know they preferred to have a self-guided tour . <p> Now the three of them were alone in the catacombs , physically underground , with only the petrified and thoroughly dead bones of departed souls for company . <p> Are you unhappy with the way the adoption process has gone so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjective , one at a time . How can we tell ? In every meeting we 've had , the attorney has had to translate for us . We tell him what to tell them , and can only assume he 's reporting to them accurately what we say . <p> Accuracy is vital , said Vic . We 've got to strip this business down to its bare-bones lineaments , if we 're going to get anywhere . Throw off the superfluous detail , and get to the heart of the matter . <p> Yes , but the woman at the agency talks for two minutes , waving her arms and pointing at us , to me she looks angry , ready to jump across her desk , and Mr. Covarrubia paraphrases her in a couple of dry sentences . He tells us she says that everything is going as smoothly as a person can expect . We sign papers when we 're not exactly sure what their contents are . We have to trust him . Whether you 're suspicious-minded or not , in the end the whole thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're so grateful you came onto the scene . Our future happiness is in your hands . <p> And the questions , said Bill . They want to know everything about us . <p> I know they have to be thorough and all . But it 's like the Inquisition . How much did we make for each of the past ten years , what exactly happened to our first baby , how did it die . You do n't know what it 's like to have to tell that story over and over . Ca n't they let him rest in peace ? His life for eight months was nothing but pure torture and suffering , and then it ended . I honestly thought adopting would be a lot easier than this . You would n't think these people could afford to insist on so much bureaucracy . They got so many babies down here starving to death . Why are they so picky ? We just want to give a good home to one of them Fatten it up . Spoil the hell out of it . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to do it over again , I swear I 'm not so sure I 'd go through with all of this . <p> Hannah looked around herself uneasily . Do n't say that , Bill . And do n't take the Lord 's name in vain in a place like this . <p> O.K. , honey . You 're feeling superstitious , that 's all right . Ai n't nothing but a shitload of bones . <p> I do n't care . I do n't want anything to jinx us . We 've come this far . <p> This city makes a person edgy . We 're both a little edgy . Do n't it make you edgy too , Vic ? I used to dance on graves in the boneyard when I was a kid , just to smart off , but I sure as hell do n't feel like dancing now . <p> Promise me that once we have this baby , we 're not going to move into any more dilapidated houses . I 'm tired of restoring rotting Victorians , fixing them up to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then selling them to somebody else , so they can enjoy it . <p> That 's our livelihood . <p> We can get normal jobs . You can work for a contractor at a regular wage . You 're too proud . <p> I do n't want to be somebody 's brick-lackey my whole life . See them scars on my fingers ? I been working like a damn coolie since I was fifteen years old . And when I kick off , they 're going to throw me in a pauper 's grave like this one , unless I got some money socked away for my burial You want to be able to pay for a house outright , do n't you ? Instead of a thirty-year mortgage , where all the money goes to pay off interest so bankers can take vacations in Hawaii ? We 've been building up . Each one we finish and sell , we 've ended up with a little more equity . <p> What difference does it make ? We 're going to squander the whole nest egg down here before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to start the process all over . <p> I ca n't say anything for sure right now . Let 's wait and see what Vic can do for us before we decide . <p> I 'm not going back up aboveground until you swear a solemn oath . <p> O.K. , O.K. I promise by my mother 's shade . Let 's not do our family laundry in front of Vic here . <p> I know we 're not the most exciting people in the world . We probably watch too much television . But we 're going to love this baby . Love it to death . <p> Hey , look who jinxing us now . See there , we both need to lighten up . Sandy 's son has come all the way down from the U.S.A. to help us , and the situation is looking up . He 's got everything under control . <p> We 've done our penance these last couple of years , and now it 's time for good things to start happening . We got the top man . With heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be a cinch . A matter of a few weeks at most now . Would you tell her , Vic ? <p> I spent some time talking with your attorney , and up to this point I believe that his work has mostly been in order . What remains is to tie up the loose ends . It was n't as much of a morass as I 'd been led to believe , once I sat down and looked at the specific documentation . <p> That 's good to hear . We 've kind of been anxious to get a second opinion . I wo n't lie to you , we 've been starting to lose hope a little . Sweating bullets every night , I do n't mind saying . This stuff is all out of our depth , and we never know what to expect next . You hear lots of rumors . Somebody we met at the souvenir shop knew somebody who got frustrated with all the red tape , and tried to adopt in Colombia through a private service . Said the people took them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were cages in the plaza lined up with kids inside , reaching their hands through the bars , saying , Take me , take me , mister . A real horror show . They freaked , and did n't pick anybody . Got the hell out of there , more like . The agency here wo n't let us meet with the mother of the baby , even though we 've asked to several times , so it makes us think something ai n't quite kosher about the whole business . <p> I do n't think it works that way here Above all , you should n't listen to rumors . The only thing second- and third-hand gossip does is create an atmosphere of uncertainty . In your case , there 's reason for cautious hope . Very cautious . <p> Cautious , right . You mean it 's going to happen one way or another , just maybe down the road aways . <p> It could be next week or six months from now , if at all . But I 'll do everything in my limited power . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go and talk to the mother , if you 'd like me to , in a calm and reasonable way , and make sure that she has n't changed her mind about this , so that if and when the paperwork is all through , you can take possession of the baby right away . <p> Changed her mind ? What do you mean ? <p> Whoa there , Jittering Jenny . You 're shaking like a leaf , baby . Vic did n't say the woman changed her mind . He just said he 's going to double-check to make sure all the bases are covered . Ai n't that right ? <p> Right . That 's the general idea . I do n't have to do it , though , if it makes either of you uneasy . <p> No , you go . We 'd appreciate it a lot . Hannah , we both got to calm down . We been seeing too many slasher movies . It does something to a person 's nervous system . I did n't even know they showed them down here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a way of killing time . Last week we saw Friday the 13th , only here they call it Tuesday the 13th  --  martes . I sure could n't figure that one out . They must have a different type of folklore ; same superstition , only different name . We 're the last people on earth who need to be watching that stuff right now , but you know how that goes . Human beings go straight for something that 's going to scare the bejeezus out of them . Go figure . Hey , remember this from when you were a kid ? I bet this made you sleep with the light on . Bill turned and placed his hands on Hannah 's ankles , started moving them slowly up toward the calves . I 'm on the first step . I 'm on the second step . I 'm on the third step . Woooh , woooh , who took my liver ? Giiiiiiive me back my liiiiiiiiiver . <p> Hannah burst into tears . Her body heaved , sob after sob as she tried to push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then came up on his knees and put his arms around her I 'm sorry , baby . I 'm awful sorry . I did n't even make the connection . It just came out . With all this pressure , I 'm not thinking straight . God , I feel like a jerk . He turned to Vic . Our baby . He died from ... <p> Vic held up his hand . I know , he said . You do n't have to say the word again . <p> I hope you can help us out I do n't know how much more of this place we can stand . <p> Mr. Covarrubia drove Vic far into Tawantinsuyo , along unpaved roads scored with ruts and tire tracks , rough as lava flow . Most of the vehicles grinding through the cement-and-adobe canyons were buses with dirt-caked windows and axles precariously low to the ground , or cargo trucks with beds of wooden slats . The many pedestrians walking along the streets , carrying empty burlap sacks and tin pails sloshing with water , seemed reluctant to make way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its exposed guts and vertical tailpipe . There were long , meandering lines at the public faucets , extending out into the road . Laying on his horn for long intervals , the attorney would inch past one pack of pedestrians only to find himself in the thick of another . <p> As the Volkswagen rattled by , Indians stared into the passenger window , neither hostile nor pleased , simply registering the mildly unusual fact of a gringo 's presence . <p> The Quechua women carried babies on their backs , cheap cotton shawls wrapped around the bodies with the bare feet and legs left exposed . There must have been some trick the mothers used when enfolding the infants in the cloth , because they looked prone to sliding out , and yet hung suspended in air , defying gravity . A boy in rubber sandals swung a boom box like a censer , sending out wreaths of music , tinny , pentatonic , arabesque . Chicha , said the attorney . This is where you get off . He left him in front of a quadrangular concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining corrugated metal door nailed saloon-style in the plank doorframe . <p> When are you coming back ? <p> Three or four hours . The Volkswagen lurched away , gears grinding . Vic could hear him cursing down the block , trying without success to get into second as the rpm 's went sky-high . He knocked on the corrugated door . It was hard to tell whether anyone inside heard him , but at last a woman with a rope-heavy braid came to the door , wearing a synthetic skirt and a white stovepipe hat with a black band . There were dark wet stains on her blouse around the nipples . She reached behind the door , brought out a shawl and threw it across the front of her blouse , as if she wanted to make sure that his gaze did n't dry out her milk supply . <p> Pin kanki , she said , drawing back from the threshold a half step . <p> My name 's Vic Featherson . You 're Anastasia Wamani ? <p> Maybe . Who wants to know ? <p> I 'm here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to adopt . <p> Have you come to take Sara ? Is this her hour , and are you the messenger ? <p> No . This is n't her hour And I 'm not the Grim Reaper . But I 'd like to talk to you about her . Ask a few simple questions . <p> For an instant she seemed to calculate whether she could shut the door and hook it before this stranger forced his way in . Then she moved aside and motioned for him to enter . He had to duck . Holding out a mesh bag dripping mango juice , he said Here , I brought you these . I bought them at a market stall we passed on the way . They only had really ripe ones . I hope you have a plate or something . <p> Why are you giving me a bag of overripe mangoes ? I do n't know . A housewarming gift , or ... I just thought you might want some . <p> There were three wooden chairs , a table , and a kerosene stove The ignited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flickered as if in a high wind . Magazine pages plastered across the walls had photos of Madonna , John Travolta , various other celebrities , their photogenic faces blackened with soot from the stove , something about Dianetics , an exploding volcano , along with pictures of saints he did n't recognize , maybe the forgotten ones from the Apocrypha . Jesus was there too , his visible heart flaming in the center of his chest . A mattress on the floor rustled with the sound of dry corn husks when she walked across it in bare feet . A baby lay on the mattress trying to turn over onto its back . Its struggle was silent , the intensity of it betrayed only by the slightly rocking body and a strand of saliva as constant and solid-seeming as an icicle or a stalactite . Anastasia lifted the baby from the mattress , considered Vic for another moment , then threw off the shawl . She raised her blouse and let the infant continue its feeding . <p> What a pretty child , he said , standing stoop-shouldered to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice round head . Is that your baby ? <p> She looked at him sharply . Whose else did you think it might be ? <p> No , I did n't mean I thought you were a wet nurse . I just meant ... Anyway , she 's beautiful No offense intended . I love those dark eyes . <p> The woman seemed skeptical and suspicious of his compliment , but finally she nodded , smiling down at the little girl to confirm what she already knew . After Vic had taken a seat , she said Quieres coca ? and he assumed she was asking him if he wanted to drink a Coca-Cola . He said yes , his mouth was pretty dry all of a sudden , and she put on a tea kettle , holding the baby to her breast while she made the necessary preparations with her free hand . When she turned up the burner , a raft of guinea pigs came swarming and squealing from underneath the stove . Their minute bodies bobbed and quivered as they fanned out across the floor to search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited for the water to boil . A long time passed . The only sound was the occasional loud suckle when the seal of the baby 's mouth broke . The woman whispered to it short and sharp , clucked and readjusted her breast . Her aureole was so large that even with its unlocked jaw , the baby could n't cover it all . Anastasia took a few small leaves from a plastic bag , dropped them in a tin mug , and poured the water . Steam rolled off the surface as she handed the cup to him . It did n't have a handle , and he had to hold it at the rim to keep from burning his fingers A clump of wet leaves floated on the top , steeping . One of them separated and drifted to the bottom . <p> Thanks . You 're not going to have any ? <p> No . You 're not paying me a social call . Drink . <p> He drank , and the taste was bitter . What is this ? <p> Coca tea . Do n't worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its natural form . It depends on how susceptible you are , I guess . <p> I 'm a lightweight . They sell these in the marketplace , do n't they ? I noticed them among the medicinal herbs when I stopped to buy the mangoes . <p> We mostly use it for religious purposes . But it dulls hunger , too . <p> I guess that 's an important property around here . <p> We all drink the tea . It 's also good for altitude sickness A lot of your kind , gringos , faint as soon as they come to the mountains . The leaf revives them . <p> But we 're at sea level <p> At the moment , yes That 's why the water took so long to heat . The next pot wo n't take as long . The higher you go , the more all things seek to turn to vapor and gases . You 'll see what I mean . Where 's the other man ? <p> You mean Mr. Covarrubia ? <p> The one with the loud car and all the papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it was him . That 's why I did n't come out at first . I do n't know his name He wanted to give me money . <p> And you did n't want to take it . <p> Not yet I need to be sure of some things . I found out that they 're going to take Sara away to a very cold place called Chicago . They say the wind blows all the time there . I wanted her to be in a warmer climate , where she wo n't catch so many colds . <p> But you should have known that from the beginning . The location is no secret . Did n't Mr. Covarrubia tell you about it right at the outset ? <p> He did n't . He seems to reveal everything by degrees . <p> Well , there are n't any mysteries here . This matter should be as straightforward as a geography lesson . Completely aboveboard . I 'm anxious to get it all resolved as quickly as possible . <p> Yet he only tells me what he believes I need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to place my trust in any of you outsiders . You lie too much and your skin smells peculiar . Lloqllo , we call it in Quechua . Like a chicken 's egg gone bad with the embryo still in it . <p> That 's funny . My skin is starting to feel kind of lloqllo right now . Maybe it 's from all the stagnant , polluted air in this city . I 've never been in such a smoggy place . This has Los Angeles beat by a mile . I feel like I 've got about ten thousand feet of air pressure piled on top of my head . I wish I could break through it all . <p> Maybe you will . <p> You 're right , though , in saying you have no real reason to trust me , since I 'm here from the United States representing the interests of the Thomases . That 's a reasonable hesitation on your part . Still , in my judgment , they 'll provide your baby with all that she needs , if you decide to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste better . Would you mind if I had another cup ? I got a little dehydrated from a bout of turista . <p> Of course . <p> All I can say is that I 'll disclose whatever information you want , to try to help you relieve any lingering doubts and suspicions . I 'll take you to meet them if you wish , so you can make up your own mind . They 're hoping to be introduced to you , and told me they requested a meeting , so you can see what kind of couple they are , but that you said no . Or did n't Mr. Covarrubia tell you about that either ? <p> Yes , he told me I do n't want to see them . <p> Vic started to leap to his feet , like a television lawyer raising an irrefutable objection , but remembered the low ceiling in time , and confined himself to setting down his coca tea . Why not ? You ca n't just give your baby up sight unseen . That 's crazy . I know that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if it were me ... Now he really did have the sensation of hyperventilating . Could subterranean magma be heating and cooling , shifting the earth 's crust under them at that very moment ? Maybe the altitude was changing , by slow degrees , inches or feet , and a mountain range was forming beneath their feet , almost imperceptibly , even as they spoke . He looked to the cement slab of floor for confirmation . It looked new , yet there were a few cracks . Had a tremor passed through the house just then ? Lima did lie directly on a major fault line , the San Andreas , where two tectonic plates came together . California really could have been a part of Peru before the continental drift The guinea pigs still swarmed , whiskers aquiver . They could n't seem to settle down . Had the noise of the burner alone brought them scurrying out from underneath the stove when she 'd set the teapot on ? Rats had poured forth from the foundations of buildings after the San Francisco earthquake . The coca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . He could feel his heart palpitating in his temple . <p> I did n't say I was giving Sara to them . I only said I did n't want to meet them . You must have misunderstood me . <p> Excuse my outburst . My head 's swimming . My opinion is irrelevant , of course . I simply meant to ask what your hesitation is about establishing contact with my clients . <p> Do they speak Spanish ? Do they speak Quechua ? <p> I 'm afraid not . <p> Have they been driven out of their homes ? Have the graves of their ancestors been disturbed , bringing forth restless souls ? Have they watched the undead spew flames out of their mouths ? <p> Flames ? Uh , I 'm not sure . I hope not . <p> Her fiery gaze swept through the atoms of Vic 's body . He felt the molecules drifting apart , trying to send him into the gaseous state . He clenched his teeth until the molecules cohered again , and a shiver passed through him . There had definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't talk to each other . All I risk by meeting with them is for them to afflict Sara with the mal de ojo by looking at her with feasting eyes , desiring her too much . Only when I know that the ground has been prepared properly , can I even think of yielding her up . I 've kept Sara alive and healthy this long , against great odds , and I do n't want anything to happen to her . I have to protect her from ill winds and ill will . So I proceed with caution . I do n't know if you 're telling me things straight . But since you 're absentmindedly eating the soggy leaves out of your tea , and since you made me a gift of rotten mangoes , I think maybe you do n't have much experience at this business . You 've come with goodwill . <p> Vic wiped his forehead with the sleeve of his sweater . Let 's get back to the matter at hand . What information do you want from me to help you make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First , you are required to learn some things yourself . You have been brought here for a purpose . It may even be that you are the messenger . <p> Take my word , I 'm not the messenger Unless you mean that I 'm the intermediary between you and the Thomases . <p> I 'll be the judge of that . Your task right now is to clear your mind and begin to penetrate , to the limited extent your state of being will allow , into the occult corners of our existence , so you 'll know why I 'm asking what I ask , and why I must have a straight answer , even if it 's not what I hope to hear . The mountain is crumbling , but we can still gather its rubble . My other children , the ones who lived through childbirth , are old enough and their bones are hard enough now that they can stay with me in these conditions , pilfer the garbage dumps , collect bottles , scraps of metal , whatever they have to , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like people always say . The government soldiers and the Shining Path guerrillas started making war against us a decade ago in our own village In all the villages . It started in the place called Aya K'uchu , the Corner of Death , and has spread everywhere . All of us are being killed off , and I 'm beginning to think that the bloodshed wo n't stop until the last one of us is dead . <p> That 's why I came here to the lowlands , and why so many others ended up here in Tawantinsuyo . To escape that . Both sides tried to force my husband into military recruitment , and when he would n't go , they disappeared him one night . I do n't even know which side was responsible . In these times , it 's hard to reach the source where one can lay blame with certainty . I was one of the lucky widows , because some of the village men , digging wells to replenish the poisoned water supply , found his body in a mass grave , the flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify the body and give it a proper burial . I was pregnant then , in my first months , nauseous , but I sat up with the body three days and three nights , enduring the stench . After that , we fled to Lima . <p> Some of the men here in the shantytown worked to help build this concrete room for us . I mend their clothes . Before they poured the foundation , I buried a llama fetus under it , one I had brought along with me , wrapped in burlap , hoping that our luck would change . But it 's brought us no better luck here than it did there . Sara barely lived through my difficult labor . <p> Vic closed his eyes as the outlines of his body converged with hers . Then the pressure in his abdomen grew until he was sure it : would burst . But if he released the child before the designated moment , she might rip through , rupturing him . He broke out in a sweat , and the ligaments below his hip sockets stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hard he was afraid he would crush the baby 's soft skull before she emerged into the world . Cats stalked one another along the tin roof , scratching their claws against the zinc , screeching and meowing , making sparks fly in the dark and drift past the window like falling stars . <p> The unsmiling midwife who was helping deliver Sara had a purple goiter , swelling her neck like a frog 's . He wanted to dispense some reasonable , calm medical advice to her , tell her the salt must not be iodized here , it was such a simple preventive step , but he could n't speak . He should have gathered some of the kelp off the beach to bring to her . He fixated on the goiter , as a focal point to keep his concentration , to dull the pain . The rest of the midwife 's features remained a blanched blur , illuminated by a lantern next to her face She took hold of the umbilical cord wrapped around Sara 's neck and slipped it over the skull . Anastasia was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asking God to forgive her for whatever she 'd done . Have you commited incest ? Have you slept with another man ? The midwife kept shaking her , asking who the father was , telling her she had to confess it . Anastasia moaned that the father was dead . Dead and buried . <p> Vic reached out and touched the goiter . Sara came through the slippery birth canal like a fish surging forth from the sea onto the land . Vic was kneeling below the squatting Anastasia now , next to the midwife , helping with the delivery . He racked his brain to try to recall odds and ends from his brief stint as an observer on the obstetrics ward . The baby must have taken fluid from the womb into her lungs , because she was wheezing so hard it sounded like she might not live more than a few minutes . The midwife insisted that the baby must be baptized without wasting a moment . But Anastasia was too weak to sit up . The midwife wrapped Sara in a blanket , and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the newborn in her arms , toward an infinitesimal church door , cats screeching and dogs barking from rooftops all along the way . <p> When she had almost reached the church door , Sara 's body became still , and cold as frost in the midwife 's arms . But as the midwife was bringing the infant corpse back toward Anastasia 's bed , to lay it across her swollen stomach , it began to squirm again . This happened three times . The midwife suggested that they tie a stone to the baby , and throw her into the Rimac River , but Anastasia shook her head . She was delirious , she 'd lost so much blood , babbling in an idiom as glottal as mucous , but she struggled to a standing position , knowing she would n't see her baby ever again once it crossed the threshold of the room in the midwife 's arms . On the fourth trip , she went with the midwife , and they were able to make it into the chapel with Sara still breathing . They had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulders and chest . <p> Vic opened his eyes again , and sank back in his chair , trembling . She lived , said Anastasia . Sara hoarded strength in her frail body , now here she is in my arms . The other children have made it through the first years , and are more seasoned . The world has been turned upside down , the fields of the Andean villages have been burned to ash , the animals slaughtered , their carcasses left to rot in the pens , or thrown into streams , the houses crushed into clumps of earth , and that is why I feel in my bones , as you must come to feel in your bones , that the time is near at hand . I want to keep my children alive until then , so that all of us can be together after . If Sara dies , I 'm afraid that something else will become of her in the afterlife . <p> The world of the future is going to be different . Not like this , with pigs rooting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wash Sara 's soiled clothes , and the price of canned milk doubling every month I believe that when this time is over , Mr. Covarrubia and all the rich people will climb with their riches from the lowlands to the peak of the highest mountain . They 'll remain up there with their livestock . But at the end of his time , their alpacas , cows , llamas , sheep , will turn to stone . The horse will turn to a bush . Right now the poor suffer , begging the rich to sell them an animal or two . But those who have plenty of animals now will have none afterward . We wo n't have to exchange our children for money with them , as we do now . They 'll bury their silver deep within the mountain , trying to put it back in the mine shafts it came from , believing they can still save it , and themselves , for later . But what life will the future hold for them ? None . Because everything will burn , even metal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They put them in underground niches . They 're in the mountains and hills , somewhere there among our charred houses . But soon , everything will be in flames , and the earth will burn clean . <p> I have to make sure that Sara remains alive until that time . And that 's the only reason I 'm willing to give her up to that couple . Do you understand now ? Life became very hard , especially after the government started the counterattack in Aya K'uchu . If I had tied a stone to Sara and thrown her in the water to drown , I would n't have been the first to do so . A lot of women already have , by stealth , at night , because they know if they do n't the baby will die some other way . But by killing their offspring , the mothers risk having them spend all eternity wandering the earth as condemned souls . <p> A certain man is causing all this despair . None of us has seen him in many years , not directly or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vain for a photograph , or some mention of his name , to prove at least that he still exists . His name is General Villanueva . He is just like Guzman , who started the Shining Path . How can such a man change the face of the entire country ? And yet he does . Guzman is powerful , so many obey him , and yet not a single soul has laid eyes on him for years . From time to time rumors spread that Guzman is in prison , or dead , or that he 's left the country . Then someone reports that he has surfaced in such and such a place , like Lazarus raised from the dead . The boulder rolled away to reveal his palpitating body . No one can confirm it or absolutely deny it . This General Villanueva is the same way . His men seem to follow the line traced by his invisible hand , carrying out his instructions to the last bitter letter . Some of the campesino leaders went to the U.S. Embassy to protest , to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead in the middle . The gringos are supplying money to arm the soldiers who destroy our coca fields , so we hear , because the Shining Path raises a lot of its money by charging a tax to the growers of coca , and the traffickers of the processed leaf . It 's bad enough to lose our coca , our lifeline , but they are n't satisfied just destroying that . Everything must be decimated . Our houses , our animals , us . Now they 're distributing pamphlets that say not to use the water in the Rimac River , because it may make us sick . No one will say exactly why . But what choice do we have , with as few spigots as there are to go around ? Why do they want to carry out this genocide ? <p> I do n't know . You 're asking the wrong person . <p> This is what we try to make known . But the protestors have never gotten past the spiked iron gates . And now , with all the bombs being planted in banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building from the opposite side of the street without being apprehended as a subversive . If we so much as raise a peep , they lump us together with the terrorists . And that 's why I want Sara to go to where the gringos are , as long as I can be sure that she 'll be safe there . <p> That 's what I 'm trying to tell you . The one concrete thing I can actually offer right now is to give you those assurances about Sara 's safety Some highly placed people in this country are personally interested in her well-being , and will do everything they can to make sure no kind of harm will come to her He hesitated , took a deep breath . The air had turned thin and chilly . The kerosene flame whipped about , almost sideways . Still , he could breathe all right , better than at any time since he 'd arrived . Maybe the coca tea had helped after all . But she had n't drunk any , and she seemed to be breathing just fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ? Her lungs were probably larger than his . He wondered whether a person could actually develop greater lung capacity , or whether it was simply a matter of natural selection and genetics . There is one other thing . I can also take some of these grievances to the Embassy . I happen to have a few connections there myself . <p> You ? What connections do you have ? Is the world so small that all of you gringos know one another ? <p> You 're in luck . I 'm the son of the American ambassador . And I 've also made the acquaintance of General Villanueva . <p> Anastasia eyed Vic as suspiciously as she had when she 'd first opened the door . Then what are you doing sitting here in this hovel with Sara and me ? <p> I made the wrong vacation plans <p> Do n't crack jokes in the crack of doom . It 's profane . <p> I 'm not . I really meant that . <p> If you have access to General Villanueva , then your presence here can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her intent and steadfast gaze . At the least , he wanted to get the conversation back on a logical footing , within his own domain of competence . Believe me , he 's no great friend of mine . But if you want me to leave , I 'll leave . Gladly . Keep in mind , though , that the fact that I 'm telling you these things might mean I 'm being as straight with you as you are with me . That is a remote possibility , is n't it ? At least you know for sure now that General Villanueva is in circulation . Now , I think you had something else you wanted to ask me about as well . It would be good for everybody if we could get this business resolved . <p> It 's possible that divine intervention has come into my life once again . That all is being revealed in its own time , and you 're the messenger , as I first believed . <p> I 'm not the messenger Stop saying that . <p> Strange things are coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the question I 've saved until now . <p> Go ahead . <p> Everything depends on your answer . One or two of the women in Tawantinsuyo gave up children for adoption , and of course they 've never seen them again . Everyone around here has watched carefully to see what would occur . The children disappear , and no one knows just what happens to them after they 're taken away . Much the same way as when their husbands disappeared in the villages . The mothers received letters from these supposed families , in striped envelopes , red and blue , but like me , they ca n't even read Spanish , much less English . As always , someone has to translate . Who knows where those letters have come from , or what they actually say ? We have no hard proof . When we raise such questions , the social workers treat us as if we 're ignorant and superstitious savages , and the babies are lucky to have escaped our clutches . Now the mothers have nearly gone mad , repenting of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what became of their children . One of them has stopped by to visit me several times , because she knows I 'm thinking of giving up Sara . She sits in that chair rubbing her empty hands up and down the lap of her skirt , eyeing my daughter . I see that this woman can barely keep herself from wrestling Sara from my arms and running away with her , to replace her own lost child . She begs me over and over not to give my daughter away , says that it 's better for her to be strangled in her swaddling cloth , if it comes to that , than to let these gringos get their hands on her . I always keep Sara well wrapped up when this woman comes around , and keep her face turned toward me , so that such a sorrowful mother wo n't have the chance to stare directly into her eyes for too long . I know that the woman is half-crazed with grief , the way that any mother would be . And yet , I listen to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 've never heard of it before . <p> It 's a being that lives off devouring the entrails of humans . The women around here are starting to say that the reason the gringos come around so much is because there are nak'aqs in your country who remove the organs from some people , living as well as dead , and put them inside others . My comadre said that no one fears them , as we do here , but that instead a cult has grown up around them . They are treated like gods , venerated , worshipped , fresh sacrifices offered up to them , no matter how much the victims suffer , and even the government pays them thousands or millions of dollars . They 're always in search of new flesh . <p> Surgeons . You 're talking about surgeons . You have them here too , in the hospitals . <p> I do n't go to the hospitals , and my neighbors do n't either . Too many people die there . So it true , then . I told my neighbor she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , Vic had gotten far enough along in his studies to have been present once in the emergency room when a team of surgeons removed the still-fresh organs of a motorcycle-accident victim , plucking them intact from the deceased . They called it " harvesting . " In anatomy class , he 'd watched autopsies performed . He still remembered with great precision the sound of the instrument sawing into the breastbone with its fine , jagged teeth , and the way the cadaver 's ribcage folded back neatly once a hinge was created , laying open to view the glossy guts , the heart , lungs , pancreas . Up until that time , the only organs he 'd ever seen were the ones displayed in shrink-wrap at the meat counters of grocery stores . The autopsies had been handled with a similar sanitized offhandedness , the organs passed around among the novices so that they would become familiar objects , banishing from the first-year med students ' impressionable minds all the gross , eerie , nonempirical lore they 'd been piling up since childhood . But that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stories about a friend of a friend at another med school , the young woman who 'd had to miss her aunt 's funeral in order to study for midterms , but the aunt turned up the following week on the medical-school autopsy table . It turned out she had donated her cadaver to science , and the niece suffered a collapse when she had to watch her relative being quartered and offered up for the inspection of her classmates . The recounting of the story was always followed by nervous laughter . <p> It 's true . You can check a box on your driver 's license if you want the surgeons to take the organs out of your body . That 's how they find out about diseases , and help prolong life for other people . But those organ removals concern the dead , not the living . If the donors are alive , they only donate organs that they have extras of . Like a kidney , for instance . It 's all voluntary . <p> Answer me this . The woman at the agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple- <p> The Thomases . <p> Yes , the Thomases , lost a child not many months after it was born . But no one will say what it died from . When I ask , they tell me that they do n't want to violate the confidentiality of these people . Now , you say that you 're willing to tell me everything I wish to know . So , what did the baby die from ? <p> I see what you 're driving at . But you 're thinking about this all in the wrong context . They have no ill intentions toward you or Sara . <p> You promised to hide nothing from me . What did their baby die from ? <p> It 's going to sound very weird if I just blurt it out . I do n't want you to get any odd ideas . <p> What did their baby die from ? <p> Why do n't you at least meet them ? <p> What did their baby die from ? <p> Vic sighed . Liver failure ; They could n't find anybody suitable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them looked down at Sara . She was asleep , her mouth still sucking feebly and unconsciously at the exposed breast . Anastasia detached her , hid the breast back inside her blouse , and hugged the sleeping baby to her . Liver failure , she repeated . <p> Their baby is dead , Anastasia . It died over a year ago . Before yours was ever born . <p> Dead infants can be brought back to life . They can be raised from the dead . Mine was . I feel for these Thomases , I know what it means to lose your child after it 's born , to begin mourning it right when your body and soul have prepared to nourish it . And I wish that they could bring theirs back . But they 're not going to use my Sara to do it . She 's been given four lives in the first hour of life , by the grace of God , and I do n't think she 'll be given a fifth . <p> You 've got this whole thing completely wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , the hell with it , it 's your decision . <p> Yes , it 's my decision . And I 'll never give Sara up to the nak'aqs . <p> Remember you 've already signed a consent document I do n't know how vigorously they 'll pursue this case , and I 'm not even very clear on how the laws work in this country , All I know is that the Thomases have spent a lot of time and money trying to get this child , and they may not give up so easily . If I can give you some advice- <p> What advice would you give ? <p> You do n't have the money to retain a lawyer of your own . You 're poor , obviously . So if you know anybody in other parts of Lima , or even in another part of this vast shantytown , who can put you up , I 'd advise you to take your baby and kids and get out of here for a while . If you can lay low until the Thomases return to the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forgotten about , when there 's no more money to be had from it . Mr. Covarrubia 's losing interest , and the couple may give up before long too , just because the paperwork is so complicated and slow-moving . But if you 're going to leave , do it soon . Tonight if possible . I 'm going to have to report back , and I do n't know what the consequences of that will be . <p> I do n't know if I can afford to leave this house . It would be a hardship . But I 'll think it over , she said . And thank you . Thank you for being a Judas to your own clients . <p> Thank you for putting it so flatteringly . <p> Would you like another cup of hot tea ? <p> No , he said , and blew on his icy hands . I 've had too much already My mouth and hands feel numb . <p> All right , then . But I want to give you a gift , in qonakuy for what you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blanket tied in a knot , and took out a woven bag . It was patterned with embroidery , six contiguous yellow triangles arranged in a circle Inside were several handfuls of coca , and a lump of black rock . <p> Vic took a few leaves into his palm , and studied their delicate veins , as if he might discern something about their properties thereby . Are they magic ? <p> She laughed , showing her teeth fully for the first time since he 'd laid eyes on her . Her teeth were bad , with a blackish cast , a few of them missing . Magic ? Not really . If I had magical powers , do you think I would have suffered all the things I 've been telling you about ? Do you think I would be living here ? <p> His finger bones had chilled . He calculated the room temperature at roughly negative 130 degrees Fahrenheit . They 'd passed from the stratosphere into the mesosphere , and there was nowhere else to go now but out into the cosmos or back down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the deer and the antelope played , past the reptilian Life-forms , past the buried treasures of the ancestors , past the animals turned to stone , down into the innermost circle of hell , where the Judases burned in their ring of fire , and never expired . <p> VI <p> What in hell 's bells are you saying ? Did you go out there with your bleeding heart and talk this woman out of giving up her child ? Is that what you 're telling us ? In less than seventy-two hours , you 've managed to completely undo four months ' worth of complicated legal maneuvering . God help the Soviets if you ever get hold of them . You might turn out to be the top-secret weapon the U.S. has been looking for all along . Bigger than Star Wars . More expensive . More mystical . More unreliable . <p> I did n't talk her out of anything . I 'm not really sure what happened . I asked a few questions and she answered them . Then she asked some questions , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , livers . <p> Did you cover chicken livers while you were at it ? And cirrhosis of the liver ? That 's an important one . Do you realize the implications of your screwup ? If it gets around among the prospects that there 's some sort of nefarious scheme afoot in the U.S. to harvest the organs of Peruvian children , and put them into our own , then the entire program , which has taken an immense effort to put into motion , could go right down the tubes . <p> The rumor has already gotten around among them . Do n't blame me . I did n't start it . I 'm just reporting it to you as I heard it . <p> The idea is so absurd , it makes me want to laugh . But I 'm not laughing , did you notice that ? Because I know from bitter experience that this is a rumor-mongering city . And a superstitious people . They already think we 're the devil . Even the educated ones have their suspicions . Then you add to that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in this underworld , and you might as well forget trying to establish any kind of credibility . I 'm all for respecting indigenous beliefs , local customs , being sensitive to the native population , and so on . God knows your mother has given me plenty of lectures on that . But when they start substituting our doctors for their knock-knocks , or whatever the hell you said they 're called , that 's where I draw the line . We 're not evil spirits . I 'm already known as the genocidal Featherston , my house is raked with gunfire on a regular basis , and I do n't want to add any more fuel to the already raging flames . <p> Maybe there 's a reason why they call you the genocidal Featherston . <p> What are you suggesting ? That you agree with their description of me ? Were you given a glimpse of special enlightenment on your trip to the mountain , so that now you feel entitled to call me names too ? If I was n't a diplomat , I 'd knock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother to take his part , to intervene as she had on the first day of his visit , before the accusations between them could escalate any further . But she remained silent , looking at him with sad disappointment . Her mute reproach stung him more than the rage of his father . What doubtless caused her the most pain was that she would now have to explain everything to the Thomases herself , about how her son had failed once again , how he had meant to take their side but had somehow or other taken someone else 's instead , how he had a way of doing things like that . The slight , if the couple was denied possession of Sara , would become a personal one , administered to them not by a faceless bureaucracy of foreign officials and lawyers whose peculiar customs they could n't understand , but directly by Mrs. Featherson , the ambassador 's wife , one of their own kind . She had promised them everything , and delivered worse than nothing . Their opinion of her would circulate among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , making it difficult for her to feel comfortable dropping in among her coterie anymore . What made the situation even worse was that Vic knew his parents would never cut him off completely . No matter what he said or did , no matter how thoroughly he burned his bridges now , there would always remain a single charred plank intact for him to walk across . And at some unspecified point in the future , he knew he would make the slow , painstaking journey back across that plank . <p> O.K. , if you want to put it that way , yes . I think you 're allowing yourself to remain blind to certain less appealing aspects of the war on coca . How exactly is the money going to be put to use ? All I 'm saying is that it 's fine to go visit a cocaine factory , but what else have you seen in the countryside besides the sanitized tours that are arranged for your consumption ? Do you know what else the coca leaves are used for ? Have you been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked to the victims , so that they can tell you their side of the story ? Have you yourself personally read over any of the depositions of those whose husbands or relatives were taken into police custody during the counterinsurgency , and never came back ? This woman says there are thousands of them . General Villanueva might have blood on his hands , and he is n't necessarily giving you the straight story in the locker room . <p> I see you 've become an overnight authority on these matters . <p> I 'm not an authority . All my information is secondhand . Like yours . I picked it up in the course of the little piece of business I was told to accomplish . I did n't ask to go out there . I was too busy working out my pathetically grandiose notions of history , as you so charitably put them . But now that I 've visited Tawantinsuyo , and had a quick look at the lay of the land , I 'm simply asking you , as Anastasia Wamani wanted me to , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't that your job ? <p> Where do you get off telling me what my job is ? If this is your best effort , then you might as well leave . You blew it . I hope you know that you 've hurt your mother as deeply as you possibly could . <p> That 's something that she and I will have to work out between us . But I might as well tell you that I plan to stay on here for a couple of more weeks to make sure that Anastasia Wamani 's wishes are respected . She 's entitled to due process . As Mom herself said , I do n't think the Thomases ' overworked attorney can be depended on at this point to look after details as scrupulously as he might , on either side of the matter . She does n't want to give up her baby , and they 're not going to jerk her around on some stupid legal technicality . In a case like this , there has to be clear mutual consent . That has yet to be established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much , and I suspect that she may have signed that consent document without a clear understanding of its contents . It may not be legally binding if any duress was involved , or any vital information withheld . So , I 'm going to do what I can . <p> You 'll do nothing of the kind . A lot more is at stake here than one person 's wishes . I 'm not going to let you destroy an entire social program on a whim . That 's been one of our few clear-cut successes here . An issue that everyone can feel good about . Plenty of people are still waiting for babies . My ability as diplomat here could be called into question if it falls through . I had a tough confirmation hearing in the Senate , I barely squeaked through , and I do n't want them to send a Congressional delegation down who will ask me to do a lot of difficult explaining about human rights just when the aid-appropriations package is pending . We 're dealing with a radical Mafia here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're one of the best organized guerrilla movements in the history of this continent , and they could very well destroy the country if we do n't extirpate both them and the drug traffickers . This adoption foolishness is the kind of minor thing that could turn into a scandal , and with the whole political situation here as jittery as it is right now , I could end up being removed from this assignment . An entire government in these parts can collapse on the basis of a rumor , so it will take even less than that to get me jerked out of here . The least that could happen is for all that money to be denied . Nobody in Congress or the Administration really understands what 's going on down here . They simply issue the decrees , and we have to fulfill them . Ever since that Robert White business up in El Salvador , they suspect all us diplomats of being flaming liberals , unless we 're part of the inner circle . <p> So you 're willing to let one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your career . <p> Who says this woman 's a victim ? You 've given no clear evidence that she is . And please do n't forget that you 're not yet an attorney Even if you can find somebody to represent her , do you think your case , based on tales of bogeymen , would hold up in a court of law ? <p> That 's what I intend to find out . That 's what the legal system 's for , is n't it ? <p> Not this time . Save it for the moot court . This is the real world . <p> I really do n't see that you can stop me . What are you going to do , deport me ? <p> Yes . That 's precisely what I plan to do , if it comes to that . I 'm going to have your visa revoked . <p> You ca n't kick me out of Peru . I 'm a private citizen . <p> Believe me , if there 's one thing I still can do , it 's get somebody removed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have had the foresight to let us make arrangements on your behalf . Those are trickier to undo , once we 've given our own seal of approval . It would have bought you a week or two , anyway . But you were too proud for that . You did n't want to be associated with Ambassador Featherson , the imperialist and paterfamilias , so have it your way . Be an orphan . All it takes is a personal request from me to have a simple tourist visa canceled , as long as that person is from my country . It had been years since Vic last traveled with his name included on his mother 's diplomatic passport , bathed in an aura of parenthetical importance , charisma twice removed . The only perk he could remember was getting to transport his pet rabbit , a pink-eyed animal suspiciously verging on distemper , from place to place with no questions asked . <p> In this case , that orphaned countryman still happens to have the same last name as you . That 's going to look pretty funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to bet some of the journalists in Lima would find the whole case of great human interest . Page one material . Political parricide . Oedipus in Peru , staggering blind among the ruins of Machu Picchu . Luckily for me , I speak the lingo . I hung around a lot of foreign countries in my youth . <p> Son . His mother spoke only that one word , but it was sufficient . Contained in the single syllable of it was a conversation they 'd been holding with one another since his birth , since she first cradled him in her arms and he began to make the rudimentary noises of all languages , gradually narrowing them down until he articulated only the ones that came from her mouth , and from his father 's mouth . She had made a career of soothing and nurturing , and she knew exactly where her power lay and when and how to exercise it . No recriminations would come from her quarter except those implied in the tone of voice in which she spoke his name . He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could summon it up in his imagination without the benefit of a visual aid . I 'm finished , he said . I 'll pack tonight and see if I can get a flight out sometime tomorrow . My ticket 's open-ended . I ca n't seem to get much studying done here anyway . And I do n't want to come down with another case of Montezuma 's Revenge . I have n't quite recovered from the first one yet . He choked back tears until he reached the door , betraying them only by what sounded like a couple of hiccups . Doing the blind staggers up the staircase , he felt less like Oedipus , and more like W. C. Fields or some other red-nosed parody of drunkenness . How do you like children , Mr. Fields ? Boiled , my dear . Boiled . <p> That night , by the soft light of a brass lamp , his mother helped him pack , folding the sleeves of his dress shirts in a complicated way , back on themselves like a straitjacket , so that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new luggage , she said . The zipper on this one is losing some of its teeth . I 'll send you a check at Christmas , but I do n't want you using it for anything else , like parking tickets . You 're going to need accessories commensurate with you status as a professional . She 'd insisted on ironing his linen suit herself , placing one of her monogrammed handkerchiefs between the searing hot iron and the material , because she did n't want him looking rumpled on the plane , and she said the maid always ended up leaving scorch marks on his father 's clothes . In one corner of the suitcase , his mother laid the alpaca sweater she 'd picked for him , one she 'd had Beatriz set back for her some time ago  --  she had simply wanted to be sure Vic approved of it himself before she bought it . But she knew the winter colors were going to set off his complexion just right . His mother had an unfailing eye for singling out the piece de resistance . Beatriz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most exquisite . All of the customers at the shop had been charmed by Vic ; they were going to be disappointed to hear he 'd left so soon , especially that Beatriz . She was such a little flirt , and Sandy was going to have to scold her for gobbling up her son with her eyes the way she had when they 'd stopped in . Not that she blamed Beatriz . She was proud to have such a beautiful child , she liked showing him off , dressing him up , getting these repressed Catholic women all hot and bothered . Was he getting a headache ? It had been a long day . She could massage his neck , there was nothing to be tense about , everything was going to work out fine and he did n't have to worry about anything . They did n't have to talk about anything . Life was upside down here in the southern hemisphere , and he could n't expect to make the complete adjustment in a couple of days . it had taken her a lot longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and probably never would . He was always too hard on himself . Way was he recoiling from her touch ? She did n't plan to force herself on him . They were n't like the families down here , where kissing and hugging and touching were obligations . It was a voluntary thing . But could n't a mother pamper her son if she wanted to , especially when she probably was n't going to see him for a long while to come ? The limousine would be waiting for them in the morning ; she had already talked to the chauffeur . They would have a nice quiet breakfast together , like in the old days , just the two of them alone out by the pool . There was no sense waking up his father , since it was his only morning to sleep in . After he got settled back in San Francisco , Vic could call them collect and talk to Chuck , say his belated goodbyes . For breakfast she 'd left instructions for papaya with lime , and fresh squeezed orange juice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chimbote . Probably the only English muffins in all of Peru , a leftover relic from the days when the Grace Company was building all the railroads from Lima up into the Andes . The railroads were engineering marvels , wonders of the modern world . Whatever your opinion of the British Empire , they certainly knew how to lay a mean track in their heyday . It boggled her mind in the pictures she 'd seen how they managed to get the tracks and bridges through some of those high mountain passes , across the chasms yawning over tortuous rivers . Next time he came for a visit , maybe they 'd ride up to Huancayo together on the milk train . She 'd had it up to here with all the official visits , the motorcades and sirens . They could go incognito , eat tamales and boiled corn with goat cheese , passed through the window by the campesina women selling food at all the stops , fishing change out of their inverted shirts as they ran beside the train . They 'd keep a travel diary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to do in the nineteenth century . Everybody said the views were breathtaking . You felt like you were going to plummet to your death right off the side , and just as you started to scream , the train took you straight into the heart of a mountain that had been blasted away . Water ran down the sides of the rock face , you could hear the rivulets above the noise of the wheels if you listened hard enough . You were happy to be in the dark , if only for an instant , before the next abyss hove into view . She would ride out to the airport with him in the morning ; there was no sense fighting traffic in one of those fume-filled taxis with the door held on by baling wire . And it would give them an extra hour in each other 's company . They 'd barely had time to start a decent chat yet . One of the problems with civilization is that people were losing the art of conversation . There was so much to say and so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
