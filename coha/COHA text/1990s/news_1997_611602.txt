<p> Alexei Anisimov said he knew he owed taxes , knew he was under investigation for tax evasion and yet , according to court reports , expected simply a verbal scolding when he faced a judge earlier this month . <p> The surprise came when the judge sentenced him to six months in jail . As police slapped handcuffs on him , the unbelieving businessman repeated over and over : " I 'll give back everything I owe . Come on , I have done nothing wrong ! " <p> According to Russian newspapers , Anisimov is the first Moscow businessman to be jailed for tax evasion in Russia 's new capitalist era . The shock for him , and for Russian observers , grew out of a feeling that he is a very small fish in a big sea of offenders . <p> " Many more cases like this are likely to be tried , " wrote the respected business newspaper Kommersant , " because . . . it is much easier to convict and jail a dozen Anisimovs than to convict and jail evaders whose back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is trying hard to convince itself , along with foreign financiers and investors , that it is serious about collecting taxes . It is a long-running and so far unfulfilled pledge . <p> The government of President Boris Yeltsin has announced periodic crackdowns . Each time , with much fanfare , a company or individual is investigated , amounts are set , and some taxes get paid . Then the urgency passes and the tax evasion business goes on as usual . <p> " I have to admit that spasmodic efforts in the past failed , " said former economics minister Yevgeny Yasin . <p> Just how long such elastic enforcement can be tolerated has become a hot issue . Top economic officials say that tax collection is the next frontier in Russia 's ongoing reform process . Some estimates put the sum of uncollected taxes at $ 100 billion . <p> The failure to collect taxes severely strains the resources of a government that repeatedly borrows money to make ends meet . A recent jump in interest rates on borrowing means that government expenses for next year already exceed expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less than envisioned on social welfare , infrastructure and wages for teachers , doctors , soldiers , bureaucrats and workers in state-run industries . <p> " It must be made clear that if we are not able to collect taxes , we will have to scale down our educational system , our public health system and make many other sacrifices , " Yasin said . " We must become a civilized state in which people pay taxes . " <p> Such tough talk has been heard before . Last spring , when delivering his state-of-the-nation speech , Yeltsin promised a crackdown . " Enough , " he declared . <p> Since then , tax collection has gone no better than the year before  --  about 50 percent of the amount due in cash , according to officials in the president 's office . That figure rises to about 60 percent if barter payments , negotiated with the government , are included . <p> For example , fuel companies supply gasoline instead of rubles ; airlines give out tickets instead of cash . But the government needs cash ; it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooting around for funds to pay an estimated $ 1 billion in back wages by Jan. 1 . <p> Despite this record , Russia and the International Monetary Fund are engaged in a kind of duet that keeps loans  --  underwritten by governments that , for the most part , collect taxes efficiently  --  flowing to Russia , which does not . <p> Last spring , the IMF released part of a $ 10 billion , three-year loan to Russia even though the country had collected only 48 percent of taxes due in the first three months of the year . The release was based on a Russian promise to do better ; when no improvement was seen , the IMF delayed the next $ 700 million installment in the fall . <p> This month , Russia again pledged to step up collections . And again an IMF delegation , which visited Moscow last week , decided to recommend delivery of the $ 700 million . The obstacles to better collection are many , Russian experts say : <p> A cozy relationship between big business and government that frequently results in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a confusing network of debts between private companies and public utilities that creates a circle of nonpayment ; and finally , terrific inventiveness on the part of businesses and individuals in exploiting tax loopholes . <p> The evasion of Anisimov , the Moscow businessman , was unusual only because he seemed naive about it . Anisimov rented metal containers to itinerant merchants at a Moscow market , paying rent to the market and protection money to local racketeers , but no taxes to the government . Police rented a container from him in a sting operation ; when he failed to pay taxes for 1996 , they charged him with evasion . <p> An accountant for a small shoe wholesaler  --  who declined to be identified other than as T.  --  sympathizes with Anisimov 's plight , if not his tactics . She said her company would have to pay 75 percent of profits in taxes , including contributions to a public housing fund and pension fund . Beyond those payments are bribes paid to a krysha , literally , " roof "  --  the armed thugs who take money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is T. 's main way of cheating the tax man . One set of books holds records of real expenses and sales ; the other is fake , for the inspectors ' eyes . The ruse is risky , in part because it demands cooperation from suppliers and buyers ; they , too , must lie so that everyone 's books more or less match up . <p> " It 's not a problem so far , " T. said . " Buyers are also avoiding taxes , so they are happy to understate their sales to us , and we are happy to understate our purchases . And our customers are willing to let us underreport our sales to them , so that they can also claim lower retail sales . " <p> Russian press reports tell of the explosion in the number of dummy companies across Russia ; once , tax inspectors found more than 4,000 of them with the same fake Moscow address . During one 18-month period , more than 600 corporations were registered under the name of a dead man  --  and the owners did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do everything in cash , with no receipts . <p> Salaried employees of large companies have found ingenious ways of earning tax-free wages . This is done fully in cooperation with , and frequently at the instigation of , their employers  --  who , by helping out , avoid paying payroll taxes and health and social benefits . <p> For instance , an employee of a concern owned by a large bank is paid a small salary by the bank but also has received a million-dollar loan that is kept in an account at the same bank ; the employee draws money from the loan in monthly installments as a salary supplement . Under current Russian law , it is all tax-free . <p> " I suspect that the loan is nothing more than on paper , " the employee said . " In any case , I do n't ask any questions . " <p> Another scheme , outlined in Kommersant , is similar to the loan gambit , except that instead of giving loans , companies take out " insurance policies " on behalf of their employees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the employee , the insurance company earns a small percentage of the policy 's value , and the employer avoids social security and other payroll taxes . <p> A new tax code , pending in parliament , is supposed to curb such practices . The code would reduce tax rates and simplify procedures in the hope that the amount collected would increase and more than offset tax reductions . <p> " When we talk about increasing collection of taxes in Russia , this means increasing taxation where there is under-collection , " said Alexander Pochinok , head of Russia 's State Tax Service . <p> However , the State Duma , the lower house of Russia 's legislature , has yet to pass the measure . Unless it is approved by the end of this year  --  very unlikely , many say  --  it can not take effect for another year at least . <p> In the meantime , the government is looking for other ways of estimating tax liability  --  for instance , by looking at comparatively extravagant purchases by low-income people . <p> Pochinok and his tax collectors also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country 's biggest companies  --  a complex issue , as some of these firms are owed money by government enterprises , including the military and energy companies . Utilities almost always are strapped for cash , since many Russians pay no electric or water bills . <p> It 's a chicken-and-egg situation . Companies that are owed government money say they will not pay taxes until the government pays its debts to them . Nonetheless , Pochinok insists , many companies feign poverty . " We know who can pay , " he said .
