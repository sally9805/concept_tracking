Section : News you can use Games and software teach you how to be a corporate innovator <p> Once creativity was inspired by mountaintops , seedy cafes and , if all else failed , deadline-induced panic . How passe . Think what Shakespeare , Edison and Picasso might have accomplished with a Pocket Innovator , a Creative Whack Pack or computer software like IdeaFisher to spur them on . <p> Creativity has become another hot button in the executive suite , corporate America 's reaction to global competition and runaway technology . Nearly 1 company in 3 now offers " creativity training " to its employes ; it was more like 1 out of 25 just five years ago , according to Training , a magazine for human-resource executives . Organizations from General Motors and IBM to Coca-Cola and the U.S. Department of Defense are sending employes to workshops and seminars where they learn , among other things , which " quadrant " of their brain is dominant - the logical upper left , the organized lower left , the visionary upper right or the emotional lower right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristics , creativity becomes more predictable and comfortable , ' says Ned Herrmann , whose Lake Lure , N.C. , consulting firm offers " whole brain " workshops to trainers and executives . For those anxious to exercise their own creative lobes , dozens of books , tapes , games , software - even " brain workout " salons ( box , page 96 ) - promise to turn an uptight number-cruncher into a one-person idea factory . <p> The challenge is to think up ideas that are both innovative and pragmatic . This brand of corporate creativity requires being open to new ideas while avoiding being branded an overzealous boat-rocker . " Every time we do a strategic analysis we tend to come up with the same answers , ' says Donald Young , director of human resources for Levi Strauss International 's Asia-Pacific division . " You have to ask yourself : If you 're continually coming up with the same solutions , could it be that those are the only answers , or is it that you are only looking at the market from one perspective ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rather than being the province of artists and inventors , creativity is a learnable skill that can be enhanced through practice and training - and a gaggle of new tools . To nudge themselves out of the status quo , Young and several other managers in the division recently attended a creativity seminar conducted by William Miller , author of The Creative Edge ( 1989 , Addison-Wesley , $12.95 ) , who believes that people are simply innovative in different ways . Creativity gets blocked in organizations , contends Miller , because of a mind-set that overemphasizes one style - such as steady , incremental change over free-wheeling experimentation . <p> For professionals who do n't have the luxury of attending workshops and ca n't justify an afternoon walking in the woods , even oddball creativity tools and techniques can be surprisingly effective . " They give you permission to look at the world a little differently , ' says Sidney Parnes , professor emeritus at the Center for Studies in Creativity at Buffalo State College , which offers a master 's degree in creative studies . It is easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate salvation . And it goes without saying that no device will turn you into a creative genius . Benefiting from creativity tools , however , calls for displaying the same openness to the device itself as to the possible range of solutions to your creative quandary . The following approaches should at least be more productive than staring into space . More entertaining , too . GAMES : <p> Playing with creativity games comes close to sanctioned goofing off . " The best ideas emerge when people loosen up and act a little crazy , ' says Arthur Van Gundy , a creativity consultant and professor of communication at the University of Oklahoma in Norman . Circles of Creativity ( $14.95 ) , from New Product Development , ( 201 ) 295-8258 , is a brainstorming tool that helps ideas , objects or images fit together in interesting , non-obvious ways . Arrows on the cardboard device rotate , pointing to dozens of phrases arranged in six concentric circles . The " try to " arrow , for instance , can be turned to suggestions like " moisten it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " yielding responses from other arrows like " failure , ' " gears ' and " cold . " When Bill Torregrossa , a director of research and development for Hershey Foods in Hershey , Pa. , was putting together a business analysis this summer , he gave Circles a whirl and landed on " bag it . " After mulling that for a moment , says Torregrossa , " I pictured myself putting whole pieces of the company into a bag . ' That gave rise to the notion of breaking the company 's Canadian hard-candy market , which had been simply defined as either " sugar ' or " sugar free , " into smaller categories such as breath mints , mini-mints and individually wrapped candies . Recalls Torregrossa : " By looking more closely at specific areas , we were able to pinpoint growth potential in mint candies that we had never noticed . ' Hershey now keeps a Circles in every conference room for moments when executives feel " blocked . " The Creative Whack Pack ( $12.95 ) , from consultant Roger von Oech , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a deck of 64 cards with bold labels like " Be Whacky , " " Do Something to It " and " Break the Rules " - aimed at shoving people off the well-worn and predictable corporate path . " Reverse Your Viewpoint " rang a bell with Don Massaro , chairman of Metaphor Computer Systems in Mountain View , Calif. , as he flipped through the Whack Pack during a meeting with his managers about quality problems . What would they do , he asked , if they were competitors who had infiltrated executive ranks to hamstring the company ? It turned out that the managers were guilty of some of the very sins they listed . For instance , by letting the product engineers dot every i on a new design proposal before getting feedback from manufacturing or marketing specialists , they had complicated the route from idea to marketplace and wasted time and money . The Pocket Innovator ( $39.95 ) , from Creative Learning International , ( 800 ) 955-4332 - complete with New Age relaxation tape - promises to help users pinpoint a goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to superiors . For most people , however , this deck of narrow , bookmark-size cards , which fans out like brightly colored paint swatches , amounts to a brainstorming aid . On each swatch , words like " visualize , ' " synthesize " and " assemble " act as problem-solving triggers . " If I feel stuck , I just flip through it and look for words that might lead to a solution , ' says Janet Rogers , a senior engineer at a Du Pont plant in Memphis . She recently used the tool , for instance , to correct a chronically plugged pipeline . The word " simplify " led Rogers to consider a more direct path so the pipeline would n't plug up . And " add " suggested using two pipelines rather than one , so there would be a backup . SOFTWARE : <p> Games often work best when people meet as a group . That 's not necessary with creativity software . It 's also nice to know that your electronic brainstorming partner wo n't laugh at your most idiotic suggestions . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> IdeaFisher ( $495 ) , from Fisher Idea Systems , ( 800 ) 289-4332 , is a kindof brainstorming thesaurus , with two databases that work together . The " QBank , " a collection of more than 3,000 questions , nudges you to define the job at hand . You might be quizzed , for instance , about the engineering of a proposed product , its timeliness and the history of similar products . The " IdeaBank " contains more than 700,000 cross-referenced words and phrases organized into 28 major categories and 387 " topical categories . " For example , typing " blue " triggers a spurt of associations that offer fodder for everything from advertising slogans to new product names : Midnight blue , blue whale , Little Boy Blue , wild blue yonder , White House Blue Room , Blue Angels , Ol ' Blue Eyes and Blue Suede Shoes . <p> U.S. News put the program to work , posing as a marketer trying to name a new laundry detergent and wanting to convey the message that the product is efficient and environmentally sound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean " and " detergent , " and the IdeaBank gave back suggestions that included Breathe , Back to Nature and Purify . Barkley Wyckoff , president of the National Advisory Service , Inc. , a financial-planning company in Bethlehem , Pa. , used IdeaFisher to concoct an advertising metaphor for safe money . The result : Think of your money as wearing a seat belt . The program does chew up 6 to 7 megabytes of valuable IBM or Macintosh computer memory , so a sizable hard disk is advised . Idea Generator Plus ( $195 , no Macintosh version ) , from Experience In Software , ( 800 ) 678-7008 , makes you examine your problem from unexpected angles by having you respond to such questions as : What similar situations have you been in ? What is the opposite of what you want to achieve ? Can you think of metaphors that apply ? What does the pessimist in you think ? Who are the people affected by your decision and what solutions might they offer ? Bryan Mattimore , president of Mattimore Communications , a creativity consulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devising an adult board game in which the players pretend to be inventors . By figuring out what advice his mother-in-law would give - he imagined she would urge him to " keep it simple " - Mattimore created a game good enough that it is now under development at the Games Gang , the New York toy company that sells Pictionary and Balderdash . MindLink , $299 ( Macintosh only ; IBM version due early next year ) , from MindLink , Inc. , ( 802 ) 457-2025 , gets at your creative quandary in a seemingly roundabout way , sending you on improvisational tangents called " idea triggers . " You might be instructed to pick up the nearest magazine at hand and extract two ideas from each of five articles . Or you may have to jot down 10 objects in view around the room . Perhaps you 'll have to work your observations into a short story . Other triggers urge you to conjure up images by pairing words such as " time ' and " confetti , " or " fun ' and " cowlike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out how these thoughts might be brought together to help you deal with your creative dilemma . If the software does n't do it , MindLink comes with a small bag of creativity-provoking trinkets such as a marble , a plastic dinosaur and a tiny toy truck . A pared-down $79 student version of the program is due out next month . <p> Not every harried professional has the time or patience to run through a software program or dawdle away the day playing with creativity toys . There is also the danger of coming to rely on a computer or a game as an idea crutch . Consultant Mattimore advises against over-using the tools in brainstorming sessions , lest the focus shift from generating good ideas to the gadgets themselves . Even if a device speeds up the creative juices , bright thoughts still have to emerge from a human brain . Aha ! <p> Brainstorming : When a group gets together to free-associate , you have to be willing to blurt out whatever comes to mind . The nuttiest idea could spark a solution . <p> A fresh perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How would your Aunt Rhoda solve the problem ? What does the pessimist in you think ? The dreamer ? <p> Force-fitting : Weird pairings of objects and ideas can yield the most surprising solutions . a radio plus a clock , after all , gave birth to the clock radio . <p> The breakthrough : The exhilerating instant when brainstorming , role-playing and force-fitting suddenly mesh is the " aha ! " moment , in creativity parlance . <p> Drawing : No caption , CARY HENRIE FOR USN &WR; <p> Drawing : Brainstorming , ILLUSTRATION BY CARY HENRIE FOR USN &WR; <p> Drawing : A fresh perspective , ILLUSTRATION BY CARY HENRIE FOR USN &WR; <p> Drawing : Force-fitting , ILLUSTRATION BY CARY HENRIE FOR USN &WR; <p> Drawing : The breakthrough , ILLUSTRATION BY CARY HENRIE FOR USN &WR; <p> By Amy Saltzman and Edward C. Baig <p> Brain salons DROP IN AND MEDITATE <p> Now that you 've spent a decade firming up every imaginable body part , get ready for the brain workout . In salons from New York to Seattle , button-down trend-setters are hooking themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulses through headphones . Supposedly , this slows brain waves and brings the user into a meditative state conducive to creative thinking . <p> About 30 to 40 centers with names like the New York Mind Fitness Center , Quest for Excellence in Dallas and the Altered States MindGym in Los Angeles charge an average of $20 to $25 for a half-hour tuneup . At Visconti 2000 in Cambridge , Mass. , which owner Maryellen Visconti touts as a " resource center for brain fitness , ' patrons fill out a questionnaire to determine their " thinking style " and don earphones and goggles . For the next half-hour , their senses are massaged by swirls of colored lights and soporific beeps and buzzes . Portable models for home use cost $250 to $895 . The MindsEye Courier ( $395 ) , sold by Synetic Systems in Seattle , is the size of a clock radio and contains 16 preprogramed sound and light sessions . <p> Something to it . Psychologists familiar with these products generally support the claim that creative breakthroughs are more likely during the slowed-down brain-wave states that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordinator of behavioral medicine at St. Luke Medical Center in Bellevue , Wash. , has used machines like the MindsEye Courier on patients for nearly a decade to help summon up suppressed images or events . He believes they are equally effective for generating creative ideas . " In the theta brain-wave state , people let down their usual defenses and there is a greater flow of ideas , ' says Budzynski . <p> The machines may indeed be , as one promotional brochure puts it , " a daydream in a briefcase . " But many of these same effects could be achieved by watching a sunset , meditating or even taking a nap . And none of those activities costs a nickel . <p> By Amy Saltzman <p>
