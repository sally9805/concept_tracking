Never trust a god who does n't dance .  --  Nietzsche IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS I would be thirteen years old , I had just reached my adult height of six feet , one and a quarter inch , and I had n't ever clone anything like this before . Miss Jackson was out of our classroom , leaving behind one of those boxy old school phonographs ; somebody put a record on that thing , and a bunch of us kids started dancing . The windows were open to a spring day pretty enough to inspire a roomful of seventh-grade nondancers to get up and dance . I do n't remember what the music was  --  maybe Rosemary Clooney singing " This Old House "  --  it seems to me the tune had to be pre-rock-'n ' - roll , because even though the year was 1955 , this was n't a true rock-'W-roll experience . This was in Ivanhoe , Virginia , population around nine hundred , and seventy miles from any place that even claimed to be a city . Cultural forces did n't reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation . As far as I know , not one of us in that room knew the first step of any kind of dance . We did n't dance with each other , and we did n't dance like each other . We just moved our bodies according to how the music provoked us . Given the logistical confusion of my body , it amazes me that I had the nerve to try it and furthermore that I did n't break something or hurt somebody as a result of my efforts . I fell into a leg-swinging , arm-flapping calisthenic kind of movement that brought with it a spiritual ecstasy worthy of an Aztec priest celebrating a spectacular maize harvest . <p> 1955 holds another memory of consequence for me , one of both glory and ignominy : early in the fall of my eighth-grade year I was invited to Kay Barnett 's birthday party in the basement of the Washington Restaurant in Wytheville , Virginia . When I walked down the steps into that room , Elvis Presley was singing " Heartbreak Hotel . " In that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , and my basic world-view was formed . Until then , I had been the kind of kid who enjoyed watching Lawrence Welk with his parents . Until then , my ultimate musical experience had been listening to Frankie Layne sing " Rose , Rose , I Love You " on the car radio on the way to Hester 's Drive-in . Nothing in my thirteen years of life had prepared me for hearing " Heartbreak Hotel . " <p> Elvis is the glorious part of that experience . The ignominious part is that when Susan Puckett whispered to Sarah Parsons , who passed it on to Mary Sawyers , who came up to me and told me directly that Becky Hampton would like to dance with me , I did n't have the gumption to ask her . I do n't really blame myself for this failure . All the lights were on down in that boxcar of a room , the only ones dancing were T. W. Alley and Judy Grubb and Pete Sadler and Judy Allison , the coolest ones of the Wytheville kids . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my neck when I realized the impossibility of walking across that floor and asking Becky to dance was my introduction to the humiliation of not dancing when you ought to be . <p> Two elements from Kay Barnett 's thirteenth birthday party remained with me and became fused with each other in my adolescent psyche : ( 1 ) a specific girl sent a specific invitation to me , and ( 2 ) such a human being as Elvis Presley existed . Girls plus Elvis equals an exciting invitation was the crude equation that began thumping at the base of my cortex . <p> In no time at all , Becky Hampton was my official girlfriend , and I was cruising the hallways of George Wythe High School in black pegged pants slung low on the hips , white-buck shoes with pink socks , a halfbuttoned-up pink shirt with the collar turned up , and hair on the sides of my head heavily butch-waxed to aim back toward what I hoped would soon become a ducktail . <p> If I had stopped to take inventory that fall of 1955 , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had going against me  --  the acne ; the lack of hygienic sophistication ( I 'd just started taking baths more regularly than once a week , I was trying to remember to use deodorant every morning , and I had n't really learned how to shave properly ) ; the limited wardrobe ( so far , I had only the one cool outfit ) ; the lousy manners ( my mother , my chauffeur for my first date , had to tell me to get out of the car and walk Becky up to her front porch ) ; the sexual ignorance ( my education consisted of all the nasty talk I 'd heard from my pals through seven and a half years of school , plus the book my parents had left on my bedside table , What Every Boy Should Know , of which I had read only selected parts ) ; the lack of a driver 's license or a car ; and the overwhelmingly inescapable fact that I could n't dance . <p> Well , actually , with Becky 's kind insistence and patient instruction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindness , to the inspiring pedagogy of her slender forearm rising to my shoulder , and to the instructive skills of her hand at the base of my neck . It 's not surprising that she quickly stopped trying to teach me to jitterbug . My brothers and my parents did n't dance . I was rural and self-conscious ; my motor skills were lousy . In my brief efforts to duplicate Becky 's footwork , I think I must have appeared to her as something like an epileptic stork . <p> Jitterbugging is still the coolest form of fast dancing with which I am familiar , and not learning to do it is still high on the list of things I hold against my youthful self . I denied myself my rightful cultural heritage as somebody who grew up in the age of Elvis , Chuck Berry , Bill Haley , and Little Richard . Girls other than Becky Hampton tried to teach me . Melva Stevens and Susan Crockett were both young women of formidable powers in 1956 , ' 57 , and ' 58 . Either one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in the street , and I 'd have tried to figure out how to do it without getting myself killed . But neither Melva nor Susan could successfully command my feet to land in the right place on the right beat . I just had to accept it that for my entire high-school career , I was forever consigned to sit out the fast ones . <p> At our school dances , making the record selections off in a secret little room , must have been some teacher or parent with a concern for teenage pregnancy . In spite of the fact that only about a third as many dancers took the floor for the fast ones , the ratio was about four fast to one slow . Body contact had to be the reason . Kids nowadays would n't stand for it . More people dance to the slow ones ( Oh , my love , my darling , I 've hungered/or your touch ) ; therefore , play more slow ones ( They asked me how I knew . . . my true love was true ) would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , nobody ever raised it . Like farmers taking the weather , we accepted the tunes that came down to us from the rafters of the gym . <p> Lots of girls danced with each other through the fast ones , but most of us boys sat in the bleachers or stood hands-in-our-pockets up against the wall or went out to the hallway for a smoke , all the while huddling up with each other , keeping at least one eye on the girls , now and then remarking Sue Himmelman 's ass or Janet Hale 's tittles or making claims to have seen Linda Umberger naked one time . ( " You did n't , you lying bastard ! " " I did , I did , I swear I did ! " ) Dignity among us bystanding males was hard to come by , and we forgave each other for even the lowest-minded strategies . Either you were a dancer , like T. W. and Pete and Billy Kincer ( even though Billy was overweight ) , or you were a spectator . Among us spectating high-school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squalor , and sexual validity was a constant struggle . But if you could get out there and dance with Annie 3 . Crockett or Joyce Eversole to " Rave On " or " Hail , Hail Rock-'n ' - Roll , " your power was immense . <p> College was another story . When we departed our old hometowns , we were granted new lives . In Charlottesville , Virginia , the hand of destiny shoved me in the direction of a fraternity house . The hands of my fraternity brothers shoved me out onto the floor when my first date in the house expressed a desire to dance . Like a boy flung into a river for his first swimming lesson , I found that ! could do it ! Or I could do something  --  nobody ever quite defined exactly what it was I did out there on the floor in the general vicinity of my Mary Washington and Sweet Briar and Mary Baldwin dates . What other people did was the U. T. , the Twist , or the Bird . I sort of stomped around and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my body had begun working out the kinks of its engineering , but what moves it made on the dance floor did n't matter . Fraternity house dancing was just how you passed the time while you consumed ( or pretended to consume ) large quantities of alcohol and/or plotted how to get your hands into your date 's underwear . <p> Those were the final years of dating in America  --  they were followed by the era of hanging out  --  and front 1960 to 1964 , i went through a lot of dates at the University of Virginia . There are two ways to account for that behavior , the first being that in one date almost any girl could plainly see that i was a vain , zit-faced hick with lousy coordination , little ability to handle my liquor , and an obtuse determination to unhook her bra . I prefer the second view , which was that a charming young Virginia gentleman such as myself was bound to keep meeting attractive young women . <p> From those years I mostly remember a blur of endings , Beverly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a fair number of others sweetly explaining to me why they did n't want to have any more dates with me . The grounds of U. Va . hold many romantic settings , in most of which some young woman shot me down . However , the experience ! choose to remember in detail from that part of my life is one of bold conquest . <p> The drummer of a band that came down from Washington to play at our fraternity house brought with him a young woman of startling appearance . She had elaborately done-up red hair ; she wore orange lipstick , a tight sweater , and a tight skirt . The college girls my fraternity brothers and I were dating wore their hair short and free ; they wore kilts and cardigan sweaters and blouses with Peter Pan collars and circle pins ; they wore knee-socks and Weejuns . Though this stranger sat in a chair discreetly placed behind the drums , every brother and every date in the house was acutely aware of her . My date for the weekend had n't shown up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , drink a lot of keg beer , and do my bystander routines from high school . Noting the redhaired young woman nodding her head and moving her shoulders in time to the music , I walked over and made gestures to her to signal my desire for her to come out from behind the band and dance . <p> Dancing with Sally Stratton was one of the significant developments of my undergraduate education . She liked to dance so much that at the moment I asked her , she 'd have accepted anyone 's invitation , and she was such a superior dancer that as we carried out our moves , she could n't help instructing me . She did n't say anything , and she did n't touch me . But her body conveyed to my body what my body ought to do to stay in sync with her body . This was new for me . New for me also was my body 's response : it actually accepted Sally 's body 's instruction . This was the first evidence in its twenty-one years of tenure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body that held a negative record of discus-throwing at George Wythe High School because it had n't been able to learn how to spin and release the discus in the right direction and so had sent it skimming over the heads of my physical education classmates standing behind me . This was a body so duck-looted that I 'd seen perfect strangers grin at the sight of me walking to class in the morning . But now this body was demonstrating something resembling physical intelligence . <p> Now that I have experienced it , I understand that our culture constantly celebrates the not uncommon phenomenon of accord between one human body and another : ballet duets tell us about it ; Ginger and Fred tell us about it ; even square-dance callers tell us about it in their laconic way . But if I had n't encountered Sally Stratton at that Teke House party in October 1963 , I could have passed through my lifetime without receiving the message : your moves are exactly right/for a few things in this world , James Dickey 's poem " Encounter In the Cage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's instruction , I would n't truly understand those lines . What does it mean when on exactly the same beat she puts her foot there , turns that way , and you put your foot here , turn this way , and at the end of your separate turns , you 're touching fingertips and moving together with the music in a completely new and perfectly mutually understood direction ? It means that our bodies remember how we once shared paradise . <p> Sally and I were n't a successful couple in any other way than on the dance floor . Though at the time I thought I was hot stuff , my guess now is that I was probably one of her least capable dance partners . Sally was a genius of party dancing . With a few hours of effort , she transformed me from a true oaf of the dance floor to a beginning-level student . But there were moves in that woman 's body that only a Baryshnikov of rock-'n ' - roll could have properly complemented . <p> Sally Stratton lived in her body more completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " That Look , " which is to say a powerful and unabashed sexual charisma . The very sight of her caused my fraternity brothers to cavort around , lidget , wink at me , blush at her , and make grade-school remarks to each other . But neither Sally nor I seemed to understand how ill-suited we were for each other . <p> In November 1963 , hitchhiking from Charlottesville up to D.C. to see Sally , I heard the news of President Kennedy 's shooting over a car radio . That night in her car , Sally and I drove around Washington in the rain , more or less aimlessly , for a long while . Then we took a motel room somewhere around Culpepper and drank a bottle of Scotch and watched TV and had minimally competent sex . If dancing with Sally was the closest I 'd been to Heaven , then being with her that night of Kennedy 's death was as weirdly hellish an experience as I 've ever had . Like most Americans in those hours , Sally and I were hurting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make ourselves feel better . The fact that we 'd achieved angelic accord on the dance floor made it all the more cruel that when we really needed comfort , all we could do was grind our bodies against each other , get distracted by the TV , get up , walk around the room , fix another drink , stare at the black-and-white screen . In the morning , in almost complete silence and in the continuing rain , Sally drove me back to my apartment in Charlottesville , let me out in the parking lot , and headed straight back to D.C. Waiting for me inside was a letter from the Dean of the College informing me that I had been put on probation for having cut too many classes . Sally and I never saw each other again . <p> Of the many sad variations of human experience , one of the saddest is that those people who influence us most significantly  --  e.g. , first friends , first loves , first great teachers  --  usually disappear from our lives without due ceremony . I let Sally Stratton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I had hardly been able to look her in the eye long enough to say , " See you later , " much less to embrace her , kiss her tenderly , and tell her that she had immeasurably deepened my sense of human possibility and that I could never adequately thank her for it . With me registering only about ten percent of what was important in it , my life was relentlessly proceeding . I was so absorbed in the project of flunking out of the University of Virginia that I could n't even realize how a remarkable woman had just escorted me through heaven and hell . <p> In the summer of 1964 , by enlisting in the United States Army , I officially began a three-year sequence of nondancing experiences , a period of drastic soul-diminishment . Only on fast-forward am I able to view this phase of my life : <p>  --  Home for a few days after basic training , I am out with Melissa Williams , a pretty girl whom I dated intermittently in high school and when I was home on vacation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Melissa and I have enjoyed physical affection . Always before , Melissa has sat right up beside me as I drove my parents ' car around town . Tonight , when I pick her up and she comes out onto her parents ' front porch , I see her seeing me , sunbaked , shorthaired , sexstarved , and oddly wrong-looking in my civilian clothes . Tonight Melissa 's only physical relationship is with the passenger-side car door . Tonight I begin to understand how the army has disassembled and reconstructed me so as to spook even the friendly girls with whom I used to slow dance in the George Wythe High School gym . <p>  --  In Germany , in airborne training at Wiesbaden Air Base , we devote hours to specific forms of pummeling our bodies : forward , backward , and sideways , we jump and fall into sawdust pits ; we strap ourselves into various harnesses that snap at our bodies when we jump from the thirty-four-foot tower ; climbing one parachute riser and then another , we hang in our harnesses that bind our crotches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , I know that if a woman caressed my body , I would suffer brain damage . Going through airborne training and getting my convict-style hair trimmed every three days , I suddenly understand that I love my pretty little barber . She speaks minimal English ; my German is n't even up to a preschool conversation . So with a German-English dictionary and a grammar book , I labor at composing a letter to her proposing a Saturday noontime rendezvous at the small bakery shop by the main train station . I mail the letter to her , then become too embarrassed to face her in person , and so have to change barbershops . Of course she does n't show up . Brooding over the next couple of days , I remember that my letter did n't say which Saturday she was to meet me . So for the next three Saturdays in a row , long after I have finished airborne training , I drive to Wiesbaden around noontime and sit by myself in the small bakery shop by the train station , having a lemon pastry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dump , near Bac Ha Hamlet , near Cu Chi , Vietnam , my buddy Gary Reynolds and I , in our sunglasses and tailored fatigues , drive our jeep up to a crowd of peasants surrounding two girls who look to be around eight and ten years old and who have been shot in the legs for entering the dump . Both children are conscious . They are being attended by a South Vietnamese Army Medic . <p>  --  In the Crystal Gardens Nightclub of Bangkok , the all-Thai band plays " Mustang Sally " three or four times a night for twenty minutes at a stretch . The only clearly audible lyrics are the title phrase . Each time " Mustang Sally " begins , forty or fifty of us GIs stand up to cheer and scream as if it were our national anthem , and more than a hundred Thai whores run out onto the dance floor , some with a GI in tow , most to dance with each other , a few to dance alone , and one or two simply to prance around the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerfully moved , I do not wish to dance . In this circumstance , the barrage of audiovisual experience that is " Mustang Sally " is of a spiritual nature ; I could no more dance to it than to " Amazing Grace " or " The Old Rugged Cross . " <p> Release from military service did not immediately put me back on the dance floor . I returned to Charlottesville and gained readmission to the University of Virginia , but I could n't shake that army look . I had dates , but they were uneasy occasions . I had n't shot anybody in Vietnam-had n't even shot at anybody  --  but young women treated me as if I might have machine-gunned infants . There was something in me , too , some cauterization of feeling that made it so that I was never on the same frequency with anybody I was with . Then I met Jannie Timm . <p> Jannie was from Richmond , mildly pretty and a little overweight , and doing time , God knows why , waiting tables in the Charlottesville HoJo 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours she liked to work . About ninety percent of the time , Jannie gave the appearance of being on automatic pilot . She smoked a little pot  --  she 'd had to do something to stand that job for very long  --  but she could n't have been all that stoned because her boss kept an eye on her and would n't let her smoke when she was on duty . <p> For about a month , before she quit HoJo 's , Jannie was more or less my girl . When I was around her , I felt neither connected nor disconnected . Sometimes she sat in a trance with her mind drifting , but then she 'd come awake and grin and touch one finger to my temple and ask me how I was doing . " Great , Jannie , " I 'd always say on such occasions . <p> " I 'm doing great . " For me in those days she was absolutely the best company for riding around town listening to the car radio , driving up to Skyline Drive to make out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bar , drinking beer and smoking and plugging quarters into the jukebox . A few years back , Jannie had gone up to Eastman on a scholarship to study the viola , but you could n't tell it from her musical taste , which ran heavily toward soul music . <p> On one rare occasion of her having a Saturday night off , Jannie got a sudden notion and insisted that we drive to Richmond . I did n't know the city , but she gave me clear directions . Around eleven that night we walked into an all-black nightclub called Doctor Yes 's , with Jannie getting helloed and hi-honeyed and hugged , and me getting hostile onceovers from every direction . This was a place she used to spend a lot of time in , she explained to me , and I did n't know whether or not she noticed the sweat broken out across my brow . The bartender-owner was her special pal . He cleared a couple of seats so that we could sit up at the bar . <p> Jannie chatted with the bartender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to being there enough so that I could breathe normally . Then I noticed that people had stopped looking at me . I was a ghost among the living . I could relax and take a look around . The place was packed ; the music was records being played over a serious sound system ; the tunes were n't what I usually heard , but they were what I wished I 'd been hearing . The dance floor was wall-to-wall dancers , and their movement was of a sort I 'd never seen before . Restrained but intricate precision was the dominant characteristic ; couples executed these polished moves , but effortlessly and with neutral facial expressions . During the slow numbers , the movements couples made were almost imperceptible . If the beginning of my dancing life was the savage , separate cavorting of some boys and girls in my seventh-grade classroom , this was the most civilized version of social dancing I had ever witnessed . <p> A song Jannie liked came on , a slow one called " The Sea of Love , " a version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't heard since . The bartender grinned at me and said that if Jannie wanted to dance , I 'd better oblige her . I knew he meant to be kidding Jannie about being willful , but I could n't help taking it as a threat that I 'd get my white ass kicked if I did n't get out there with her on the floor . <p> To dance that one dance with Jannie was to feel both imperiled and enraptured . Couples were dancing with each other as usual , and there was certainly nothing organized about it , but about halfway through <p> " The Sea of Love , " I had a sense of Jannie and me being among many people moving massively together . I knew I did n't really belong in that place ; I knew there were young men around me who would have liked an excuse to harm me . But Jannie and the music and the dance and all the subtly moving people conspired to make me feel impossibly connected to them and to everything outside myself . <p> When it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar , where for a while both of us seemed to drop into separate trances . Suddenly , as she was given to doing , Janhie sort of jerked her head around and took note of me , which gesture also pulled me out of my coma . When Jannie had said her farewells , we got out of there and drove back to Charlottesville . Not too long afterwards , Jannie quit her job , told me good-bye in a distracted kind of way , and moved back to Richmond . She and I parted amiably enough , but once again , I had n't properly understood someone 's gift to me , which in this case was reconnecting me with the world and its citizens . <p> One of the blessings of my recent years has been to teach in a graduate summer program , the Bread Loaf School of English , where there are dances almost every weekend . They take place in a barn whose floor one day will collapse and drop a hundred seventy-five of us dancing fools down into what used to be milking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep on receiving dancing illuminations on a regular basis . I heave and puff , I sweat , I run keg-beer through my system , and the next morning I feel as if I 'm an athlete of some unknown sport who stayed out too late celebrating a victory . Dancing , man , I won at dancing last night , I have to tell myself . <p> So what am I discovering with my dancing nowadays ? Hoofing it out on the barn floor one night with one of my best young writing students to The Talking Heads ' " Burning Down the House , " f discovered something essential about her generation and mine . I was striving to match at least some of my moves to some of hers when I suddenly realized that her aim was the opposite of mine : she flung her body most admirably this way and that , but pattern was n't what she sought ; chaos of movement was her guiding principle . If there had been any synchronizing of her body and mine , we would n't have been burning down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talent I admired , and so her decision to stop making sense on the dance floor was most disturbing to me . The values of Western civilization are deeply corrupt , I was willing to grant her that , but did that mean that we could never dance with each other again ? Had I been thrown back dance-wise to my seventh-grade classroom ? <p> It is that with that has been the guiding principle of my dancing curriculum . To dance with someone is to celebrate the fact that there are two of us , is to demonstrate how two of us can make a particular kind of beauty that ca n't be made by just one , is to assert that the connection between self and other is meaningful , is to defy spiritual isolation . In this mature phase of my dancing life , I think that certain people are suited to dance with each other and certain others are not . It does n't have anything to do with common background or liking or intellectual capacity or hobbies or anything else . It 's the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you do n't : either you can dance with somebody or you ca n't . There 's a woman I 've come to be friends with through our attending the Bread Loaf Writers ' Conference for the past eight or nine years . She likes the Writers ' Conference dances just as much as I do ; she stands on the edge of the dance floor and nods and sways to the music . Whenever I see her doing that , I ask her to dance , and she always says no . She hurts my feelings a little bit , but I respect her choice in this matter . What I hope she thinks is that if we danced and our moves were n't right for each other , we might ruin our friendship . But as a former sweaty-palmed bystander , I say it 's worth taking a chance . When your moves are right for someone else , it is wholly rewarding in and of itself : you do n't need to talk with , go to bed with , or for that matter , even dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to modern men and women , dancing with somebody can be a nonprofit activity that is utterly satisfying . <p> At the Bread Loaf School of English , in the summer of 1979 , I asked someone to dance whom I had seen around but whose name had n't stayed with me . She was a small , quiet , modestly dressed young woman . From our first steps , she and I knew we were perfectly suited for each other . The song was Marvin Gaye 's " Sexual Healing , " which always pleasantly embarrasses me . I blushed from the words of it , but I kept on blushing for the pleasure of our dance , blushing , grinning , and going on and on with it . It felt as if she and I gradually levitated above the crowd of dancers and became a vision they imagined of the Heavenly Dancers . When Marvin ( May he rest in peace ) started winding down , she and I gently descended to the floor .

Throughout the ceremony we faculty members sat on a stage , from which we could look down and see all the candidates for graduation . I knew most of them by name , but a few from previous years , having completed their final requirements off campus , had shown up just for this ceremony . A young woman in a cap and gown seemed very familiar to me , but I did n't place her until she walked , smiling , up to the platform to receive her diploma from the president .

I rarely resist my culture 's basic teaching point , which is that manipulating people through false offers of friendship , trustworthiness , and loyalty is not only OK , it 's admirable .

Robert Frost 's worrying the issue of Fire or Ice , which once seemed such a witty and courageous facing of the dark future , has become an almost comforting nursery rhyme : fire or ice would be easy ; the greater likelihood is that we human beings are going to poison ourselves and each other and all the living creatures of the planet , are going to choose the slowest and most ignominious of all possible deaths . <p> The unspeakable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I deserve for having done my part to make it what it is .
