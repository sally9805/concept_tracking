Stuck in Neutral The Packers stumbled out of the preseason still trying to get into gear // As the last of 52 preseason penalties was walked off against the Packers in a desolate Pro Player Stadium late last Friday night , Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren motioned referee Phil Luckett within earshot . Fed up with his team 's shoddy play this summer , Holmgren said with a snarl , " Can we just go home ? Can we please just get this over with ? " // Mercifully for the Packers the preseason is over . In the 21-7 loss to the Dolphins , Green Bay 's third defeat in five exhibitions , Holmgren did n't like the way his offense was playing . Eliminate a steamrollering of the hapless Saints , and the Brett Favre-led first unit was outscored by a combined 49-17 in preseason games against the Chiefs , Raiders , Broncos and Dolphins . " We ca n't live off the last two years , " says running back Raymont Harris , a free-agent acquisition who filled in for holdout Dorsey Levens . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Holmgren , in fact , was so concerned about the offense last week that he donned the headset linked to the quarterback and called the plays himself for the first time since early 1994 , his third season in Green Bay . Customarily , offensive coordinator Sherm Lewis sits in the coaches ' booth giving suggestions to Holmgren , who then picks the play and relays it to quarterbacks coach Andy Reid , who relays the call to the quarterback . By eliminating the middleman , Holmgren hoped to speed things up , but the offense was n't any smoother in Miami . The coach was n't crazy about the results of the experiment , either . " The problem is , I 'm concentrating on doing that , and I ca n't concentrate on the other things  --  game strategy , special teams , the clock , " he says . " I do n't know if I 'll continue it . " // Holmgren also felt compelled last week to summon Favre for a fireside chat  --  they 've had many such discussions during their six-plus years together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brett would be the first to tell you he does n't study in the preseason , " Holmgren says . " He 's a wealthy young man . He 's accomplished a lot . I guess I wanted to ask him if he 's still hungry . I got the answer I wanted . I know him well enough to know when he 's ready to go , and he is. " // The return of Levens , who rushed for 1,435 yards last season , and wideout Robert Brooks , who caught 60 passes in 1997 and is coming off back surgery , gives Green Bay 10 of the 11 offensive starters from last year 's NFC championship team . ( Marco Rivera replaces left guard Aaron Taylor , a free agent who signed with the Chargers. ) // Things are n't as settled on a defense that the Broncos ' Terrell Davis shredded for 157 yards in the Super Bowl last January . Fourth against the run and first against the pass in its 1996 championship season , Green Bay fell to 20th and eighth , respectively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur says , " because in ' 96 we had no injuries and last year we were patching it together every week , and we still finished fifth in the league in scoring defense . " // Nevertheless , in the off-season the Packers lost three valued starters  --  defensive end Gabe Wilkins , cornerback Doug Evans and free safety Eugene Robinson  --  to free agency . Their replacements : Vonnie Holliday , the club 's first-round draft pick who was impressive but not impactful in the preseason ; cornerback Craig Newsome , who missed almost all of last season after undergoing major knee surgery ; and second-year man Darren Sharper , who will move to cornerback in most nickel packages . The nickelback is 34-year-old Mike Prior , who was waived in the off-season and later re-signed. // " We 'll bite the bullet and pray no one gets hurt , " says Shurmur of the secondary . Yet after final roster cuts were made on Sunday , executive vice president and general manager Ron Wolf was bullish about his cornerbacks : starters New-some and third-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve . " We 'll function as well as any team in the league at that position , " Wolf said . // Still , with Levens , Brooks and defensive tackle Gilbert Brown ( strained groin ) rusty , Green Bay has a lot to do to get ready for this Sunday 's opener against the Lions . As Shurmur says , " In six weeks of camp you 're supposed to become what you 're going to be . But how would we know what that is right now ? With free agency , holdouts and injuries , we 'll have to spend the first few weeks of the season trying to find ourselves . " // Preseason Leftovers Wait-and-See Propositions // A lot of teams went into training camp with major questions , and we still do n't have the answers to some of them . // 1 . Can first-year coach Chan Gailey right the Cowboys ' sinking ship ? // Real doubt remains . The Cowboys , 0-10 in regular-season and exhibition games since Nov. 23 , foolishly finished the preseason cutting up ( pun intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaguars . Dallas continues to be plagued by off-field shenanigans similar to those that helped bring down the Barry Switzer regime , with the clumsy handling of the Michael Irvin-Everett McIver dormitory episode dominating camp . On the field the Cowboys have no pass rush , defensive tackle Leon Lett has a sore knee , and cornerback Deion Sanders keeps getting nicked . Dallas is down to its last wake-up call . // 2 . Can Panthers quarterback Kerry Collins revive his career ? // He looked surprisingly mobile while running new Carolina offensive coordinator Gil Haskell 's West Coast-style offense , completing 58% of his passes with two touchdowns and no interceptions . That 's a good sign from someone who sank to the bottom of the NFL quarterback ratings last year . " All I can tell you , " says Haskell , sounding like a proud papa , " is that the other day in practice he missed a throw on the goal line and everyone stared at him , shocked . " // 3 . Have the Chiefs tinkered enough to be a postseason threat ? // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade , but the Chiefs have n't won a playoff game in four years , and their preseason was horrendous . The starting backfield of Donnell Bennett and Kimble Anders combined to average 2.7 yards a carry . Pete Stoyanovich missed six of 11 field goal attempts . Defensive tackle Chester McGlockton , a free-agent acquisition , has taken two muscle-relaxant injections to treat an unspecified lower-back injury and may not be able to play in the opener against the Raiders , his former team . // 4 . Who 'll be better as a rookie , Peyton Manning or Ryan Leaf ? // Leaf had the better preseason , no doubt about it . Plus the left side of his line , where free-agent pickups John Jackson and Aaron Taylor protected his blind side , is significantly more effective than Manning 's . Still , one pro personnel director said something last week that bodes well for Manning when the real bullets start flying : " Every time he drops back , he reads his progression quickly . On the tape I 've seen , he has n't made mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This Beholder // Best Team I Saw : the Broncos , who displayed not an ounce of complacency . Worst Team I Saw : the Saints , who for the second consecutive year will have the sorriest offense in the league . Best Rookie I Saw : Steelers wideout-return man Hines Ward , who will be a hero in Pittsburgh by Thanksgiving . Best Emerging Star I Saw : Dolphins second-year defensive end Jason Taylor , who has the speed of a wide receiver . Teams on the Rise : 1 ) Ravens , 2 ) Raiders , 3 ) Vikings . Teams on the Decline : 1 ) Bengals , 2 ) Rams , 3 ) Bears . // Brian Griese Great Summer For Elway Heir // Broncos rookie quarterback Brian Griese played it smart in the preseason , quietly eating up as much as John Elway would feed him about coach Mike Shanahan 's complex offense . At practice Elway would sidle up to Griese after a play and tell him why he threw to the split end when the logical choice would have been the tight end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So Griese sits and learns for the next season or two , after which he will probably inherit the starting job . " It 's the best situation for me , " he says . " I 'm not getting my brains beat in when I 'm not ready , and I 'm learning from the best . " // Griese threw the winning touchdown pass in the Broncos ' first two preseason games  --  eight yards to running back Detron Smith against the Rams and 48 yards to wideout Justin Armour against the Saints . In four games Griese completed 27 of 50 passes for 372 yards and had just one interception . In the locker room he is earning respect . " Brian is going to be a great player in this system for a long time , " says Elway. // The End Zone For Your Copy , Call 1-800 ... // Rams cornerback Ryan McNeil , who ended his holdout on Monday , tried to sell his services around the NFL by publishing a 14-page brochure that includes eight pages of multicolored pie charts and bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Famer , in five years McNeil has become the league 's most complete cornerback , " the brochure reads . While McNeil led the NFL in interceptions in ' 97 , he has yet to be selected to the Pro Bowl .
