<p> THE main street of Safwan is beginning to show signs of life . <p> The dusty border village in southern Iraq was only weeks ago the scene of intense fighting , as Iraqi troops fled through on their way out of neighboring Kuwait . <p> Today , people dressed in ragged clothes walk among the few vehicles left . Others squat on the dirt sidewalk behind whatever they have to sell . <p> Crackers , soap , and other merchandise have found their way here as townspeople hesitantly come home from points further north . <p> But behind the apparent return to normalcy lies a unique story of this town and its people - a place which came under United States administration but which will revert to Iraqi civil authority as a United Nations observer mission replaces the United States Army here . <p> The changeover also reveals much about the nature of political control in the Iraq of Saddam Hussein and his Baathist regime , a system that has long relied on fear and expressed loyalty to keep itself in power . <p> Situated adjacent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prewar population of 17,000 , Safwan is the only major town to come under US control in the vast desert region from which the Army has now withdrawn . <p> As in a nearby refugee camp housing more than 11,000 Iraqis , US military units have distributed water to town residents . US soldiers have also provided medical care at a bomb-damaged clinic and security by patrolling the streets in armed military vehicles . <p> Although Iraqi civilian authorities have remained in town , the US has been the de facto government , and many town residents say they like it . <p> " The soldiers have been so good to us , " says a man sitting in the dirt in front of a wall pockmarked from a coalition cluster bomb and scrawled with " Down Saddam . " <p> " But now we do not know what to expect , as they are to go . " <p> He is one of the few people willing to talk with visiting journalists . Most quickly look away when a photographer points a camera . <p> Others in town are openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mayor . While speaking with reporters , he points to the rubble of several bombed houses . <p> " See what the Americans have done ? All people of Safwan are glad they are going . They are only here trying to help because they know they have killed civilians , " he says . But the tone of his remarks suggest this is what he is expected to say ; his comments lacked real conviction . Asked how the townspeople feel about Saddam , the stocky young man looks to the ground and replies : " We are all glad the great leader will again govern us . " <p> Two US Army physician 's assistants in the town medical clinic say government employees have no choice but to express such support , knowing that their lives depend on it . <p> Under the cease-fire agreement , Iraqi civilian authorities will govern their side of the nine-mile-wide demilitarized border zone , which includes Safwan . <p> " I think most of these people are desperately afraid of the Iraqi government 's return , and of course these government people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Officer Ben Beaoui , who was born and raised in Tunisia and speaks Arabic . <p> Mr. Beaoui and Joe Hatch , another Army physician 's assistant , have worked steadily in the clinic since March 19 , and only recently turned things back over to Iraqi administration . <p> They say they have come to know Safwan and its people well enough to sense the fear and mistrust that permeate the town . They think injuries , such as gunshot wounds , and even murders have resulted from political fights . <p> " Everyone in this town knows us , they were just cramming in here with every kind of problem you can imagine , " Beaoui says , sitting in the centrally located clinic building . " I think we know these people as well as anybody , and I know they 're afraid of what comes next . " <p> " But we ca n't stay and run things forever , " says Mr. Hatch . " We have to let their system begin to operate again . " <p> In their case , that means staying temporarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an Iraqi doctor . <p> Asked his opinion of the Americans ' role , Dr. Husain sounds much like the mayor 's son . " The people are very happy their own government and police will come back to them , after the criminals and murderers tried to take control , " he says quietly , referring to the rebels who sought to overthrow Saddam after the war ended . <p> Asked about Iraq 's takeover of Kuwait , he said , " As intelligent people , you know that the Arab nation is one , and in our hearts we know that Kuwait will always be part of Iraq . " <p> These comments bring scant comfort to townspeople and refugees alike , especially given that the 1,440-person UN mission can only report violations of the cease-fire . <p> And to gauge the true sentiments of the Safwanis , the two Army medics say one need only look at the clinic itself . <p> " Before at this hour , we could n't keep up with all the people crowding in here to see us , " Hatch says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's so much mistrust in this town , everyone is afraid of everyone else . " <p> Most civilians in town are not refugees but residents who left during the war and are slowly drifting back . But the town does have some squatters in abandoned buildings , people whose future is as uncertain as the thousands of refugees camped just down the highway . <p> One man staying with many others in a local school says he fears for the future , but blames President Bush for the situation . <p> " Bush lied to us , saying we should rebel and be rid of the tyrant and then abandoned us , " he says , as dozens of children dressed in tattered clothes look on . " Now he is abandoning us again by pulling out the only troops who can protect us . " <p> For weeks the refugees have held daily demonstrations against Saddam and the US withdrawal along the international highway , saying they have no confidence in the arriving UN forces . <p> Tensions have risen to the point that some people worry about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a preventive measure , the Kuwaiti Army has set up new highway checkpoints south of the demilitarized zone .
