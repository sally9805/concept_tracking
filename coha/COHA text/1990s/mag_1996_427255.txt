An abundance of ancestral galaxies revealed <p> Somewhere deep in space and far back in time , the vast reserves of hydrogen and helium gas in young galaxies collapsed into clouds . These gaseous cocoons soon became stellar nurseries , setting the galaxies aflame with the first blush of starlight . After a journey lasting several billion years , the faint light finally reached Earth . <p> For nearly 2 decades , astronomers have sought these primeval glimmers-baby pictures of the oldest galaxies in the universe . Despite occasional successes , their quest for a population of primitive galaxies proved a spectacular failure . <p> That 's why Charles C. Steidel , a young astronomer at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , is elated-and a bit humbled-about his team 's sudden embarrassment of riches . Using a novel technique to ferret out faraway galaxies , Steidel and his colleagues in a few months have discovered 23 galaxies so distant from Earth that the light they emit took 85 percent of the age of the universe to get here . <p> That means that if the cosmos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the starlight emitted by these galaxies traveled for 13 billion years to reach Earth . It therefore reveals how galaxies looked when they were mere toddlers . Indeed , the astronomers find that starlight from each of the newly discovered galaxies has a pronounced bluish color , indicating that the stars are young and that these galaxies are still in the first throes of starbirth . <p> " This is an amazing discovery . They have found a group of galaxies that people have been seeking for the past decade , " says Richard G. McMahon of the University of Cambridge in England . " It 's one of the most important findings in astronomy in the last 5 years . " <p> Moreover , Steidel and his colleagues argue that the galaxies they 've discovered represent the early ancestors of two stellar populations believed to be the oldest in the universe-the football-shaped elliptical galaxies and the central part of spiral galaxies like the Milky Way . <p> Multicolor images of 120 other intriguing galaxies have also been captured by Steidel and his collaborators , who include Mauro Giavalisco of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal Greenwich Observatory in Cambridge , Mark Dickinson of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , and Kurt L. Adelberger of Caltech . <p> Although the distances to these galaxies have yet to be measured , their portraits put them into the same category as the other young galaxies . <p> For most astronomers , the team 's findings fit the description , or nearly so , of one of the Holy Grails of astronomy : a collection of primeval galaxies . Although the galaxies discovered by Steidel 's team had already fully assembled , the heavenly snapshots caught them at an extremely early stage of development . <p> Nonetheless , Steidel all but refuses to classify his objects as primeval . Indeed , he scrupulously avoids using the " p " word in his team 's upcoming article in the ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS . <p> " Whether you want to call these ' primeval ' galaxies is up to you , " says Steidel , noting that different astronomers define " primeval " in different ways . <p> On another point , however , Steidel pulls no punches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their contention that the newly discovered galaxies are the forerunners of elliptical galaxies and the central part of spirals . <p> The number of galaxies they found , given the volume of space at which they looked , matches the density expected from today 's population of ellipticals and spirals . In addition , images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope , including the extraordinarily detailed Hubble Deep Field ( SN : 1/20/96 , p. 36 ) , reveal the shape of six of the distant galaxies . The images show that all six resemble compact balls-just the right shape to evolve into an elliptical galaxy or the central , spherical component of a spiral , Steidel explains . <p> " We think we 're seeing the formation of stars in the oldest parts of galaxies , " says Steidel . " The space density , star formation rates , morphologies and physical sizes , masses , and early epoch of the galaxy population that we have isolated ... all point to the conclusion that we are seeing directly , for the first time , the spheroidal component of present-day luminous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McMahon agrees . " This means that when we study these objects , we are learning about how typical galaxies , like our Milky Way , have formed , " he says . <p> The technique employed to find these galaxies , McMahon adds , is almost as intriguing as the team 's results . Astronomers hunting for primeval galaxies typically set their sights on a particular beacon-a wavelength of light known as Lymanalpha . It is thought to be the single strongest emission from newly forming stars ; hydrogen atoms radiate this ultraviolet light when an electron falls from the first excited state to the ground state . Researchers had assumed that this light would stick out like a sore thumb , broadcasting the fireworks of starbirth to telescopes several billion light-years distant . <p> But with the exception of a few isolated findings ( see sidebar ) , numerous searchers have come up empty-handed . In retrospect , says Steidel , looking for Lymanalpha provides at best a needle-in-the-hay-stack approach to detecting primeval galaxies . <p> He notes , for example , that even a small amount of dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's because hydrogen atoms in the galaxy easily scatter Lyman-alpha photons . As a result , these photons ca n't leave the galaxy as readily as other particles of light and are more likely to encounter even trace amounts of dust . <p> Steidel cites another limitation . I pick out Lyman-alpha emission from the general background of galactic light astronomers must use a filter that permits the passage of only a very narrow range of wavelengths . The expansion of the universe shifts all light , including Lyman-alpha , to redder wavelengths . The greater the galaxy 's distance from Earth , the larger the redshift . To look for galaxies that reside at particular distances , astronomers pick filters designed to detect specific redshifted Lymanalpha emissions . <p> This technique severely restricts the range of distances that observers can search at any one time , Steidel points out . <p> In 1992 , Steidel and Donald Hamilton of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg , Germany , described a novel method for picking out distant galaxies from the zoo of celestial bodies in a telescope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should show up at about the same level of brightness at red and green wavelengths but vanish in the ultraviolet . That 's because hydrogen gas absorbs ultraviolet light , and the most distant galaxies have the largest amount of hydrogen between them and Earth . <p> To spot these " ultraviolet dropouts , " the astronomers would have to compare images of galaxies taken in a variety of colors , ranging from the red to the near ultraviolet . Steidel and his collaborators gathered such multiwavelength portraits at three observatories : the William Herschel Telescope in the Canary Islands , Spain , the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in La Serena , Chile , and Palomar Observatory near Escondido , Calif . In each set of images , a significant number of the faintest , smallest galaxies-the objects most likely to be distant-did indeed disappear in the ultraviolet . <p> The team collected lots of candidates , but other researchers remained skeptical . " We found these objects and had no way of proving to anyone that they were at the distance where we said they were-other than these arguments about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dead end . " <p> To prove their case , Steidel and his collaborators needed to measure the actual distances to the dropout galaxies . <p> Last October , the astronomers got their chance . Atop an extinct volcano in Hawaii , they pointed the world 's largest optical telescope-the WM . Keck Telescope on Mauna Kea-at some of their candidates . The spectra revealed that 17 of these galaxies have red-shifts between 3 and 3.4 , indicating that the bodies reside about 13 billion light-years from Earth . <p> " There was a lot of relief and a lot of excitement , " Steidel recalls . " This was really the leg we needed to stand on to push this technique further along . " <p> In applying the multicolor search method , he adds , " we are trying to get a global picture . We 're not interested in finding an unusual object in order to say that we 've found the most distant galaxy known . Instead , we want to know what the typical galaxy population is like , how far galaxy formation has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're finding these galaxies in a systematic way , rather than by pure luck . " <p> Last month , Steidel and his colleagues headed back to Hawaii , just days after two of his collaborators , Dickinson and Giavalisco , helped unveil the Hubble Deep Field image at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in San Antonio . The team zeroed in on six galaxies , imaged in the Deep Field and another Hubble picture , that vanished in the ultraviolet . Using Keck to measure redshifts , the team found that all six galaxies are indeed distant , Steidel told SCIENCE NEWS . <p> Like the other 17 objects observed in October , these galaxies have a bluish tinge compared with older galaxies , indicating that they are still forming their first generation of stars . So far , says Steidel , use of this color criterion has proved a winning strategy : 90 percent of the galaxies that vanish in the ultraviolet reside at large distances . <p> Because his team has spied so many galaxies at this remote epoch , Steidel concludes that galaxy formation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of even earlier galaxy formation also comes from the existence of the powerful light beacons called quasars , with redshifts as great as 5 . The atypical galaxies that house quasars must have formed even before the more ordinary galaxies that Steidel 's team has found . <p> But when did the average , run-of-themill galaxy assemble ? That 's the question astronomers are now poised to answer , says Alan Dressier of the Carnegie Observatories . Armed with the new findings on primeval galaxies , " we 're ready to bust into the early universe and find out how galaxies formed , " he notes . <p> Steidel and his colleagues have already taken the first step . In a cursory examination of the Hubble Deep Field , he and Dickinson independently applied the same ultraviolet dropout technique . This time , however , they sought galaxies from even greater distances and more remote reaches of cosmic time . Such objects , which would reside farther than 13.5 billion light-years from Earth , would have a redshift greater than 4 . <p> The astronomers saw few galaxies that fill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the same kind of distant galaxies , were they to exist , at a redshift greater than 4 , " Steidel comments . " The fact is that we do n't . " <p> Dickinson cautions that the color criterion for finding distant galaxies is harder to apply at higher redshifts but admits that the preliminary findings suggest a startling possibility . If the galaxies are n't visible , perhaps they had n't yet come into being . <p> " I think that means it 's very likely that the galaxies we 've been seeing had formed somewhere between redshift 4 and redshift 3.5 , " Steidel says . <p> Astronomers may finally have peered far enough back in time to come face to face with a blank slate-the point at which most galaxies had yet to assemble . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Mug shot of a distant galaxy ( in circle ) taken with the Hubble Space Telescope . <p> By RON COWEN <p> TWO LUCKY FINDS <p> In comparing portraits of galaxies taken through different color filters , Charles C. Steidel of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his colleagues have found a way to systematically identify distant galaxies in their first blush of starbirth . But in other cases , luck played a larger role . Completely by accident , Howard K.C. Yee of the University of Toronto happened on a single galaxy that he classifies as primeval . So did Stanislav G. Djorgovski of Caltech . <p> A year ago , Yee , Erica Ellingson of the University of Colorado at Boulder , and their colleagues had their hands full analyzing thin dark lines-the absorption spectra-of some 2,500 galaxies obtained with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope on Hawaii 's Mauna Kea . The spectra were part of a survey to measure the velocity of galaxies that congregate in clusters . One galaxy had Yee and Ellingson puzzled . Its spectra did n't match that of any resident of a cluster . In addition , the object was unusually bright . <p> Yee showed the oddball spectra to a visitor , Jill Bechtold of the University of Arizona in Tucson . Familiar with the fingerprints of faraway objects , Bechtold quickly identified the spectra as those of a galaxy nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At a redshift of 2.7 , this galaxy lies about 12.5 billion light-years from Earth , so far away that the light it emits must traverse nearly the entire breadth of the universe to reach Earth . The radiation detected by a telescope today thus provides a snapshot of what the galaxy looked like when the universe was about 20 percent of its current age . <p> The luminous appearance of the galaxy-about 100 times brighter than any of the primeval galaxies found by Steidel and his colleagues-suggests that it is making stars at a furious rate , churning out the equivalent of 1,000 new suns every year . Infrared and visible-light spectra reveal that massive young stars , which die out rapidly , produce the bulk of the galaxy 's light . This indicates , says Yee , that the galaxy probably began its first burst of star formation no more than 30 million years earlier . <p> " This object appears to fit every definition of a protogalaxy , " he and his colleagues will report in the May ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL . <p> Yee notes that observations planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the galaxy is truly as luminous as it appears or whether some of the brightness stems from a cosmic mirage known as gravitational lensing . In lensing , the gravitational field of a massive foreground object bends and amplifies light from the galaxy , making it seem brighter than it really is . If this were the case , the galaxy would still reside at the same great distance from Earth but would n't be making as many new stars as it appears to be . <p> During the past 2 decades , astronomers have used the bright light of quasars , the powerhouses that lie at the centers of some galaxies , to explore the distant reaches of the universe . On their way to Earth , these brilliant beacons pass through a vast array of gas clouds and galaxies , each of which absorbs some of the quasar 's light . <p> A decade ago , researchers discovered that some of the absorption lines are much stronger than others . Each line indicates the presence of a group of objects , known as damped Lyman-alpha absorption systems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiral galaxies , and perhaps the elliptical galaxies , present in the cosmos today ( SN : 9/17/94 , p. 188 ) . <p> While looking for primeval galaxies last September with the WM . Keck Telescope on Mauna Kea , Djorgovksi and his colleagues stumbled upon an intriguing object : a distant galaxy , with a redshift of 3.15 , that qualifies as a damped Lyman-alpha system . The galaxy lies directly in the path of light emitted by the quasar 2233+131 . Their image of the galaxy , the astronomers report , ranks as the first clear-cut portrait of a damped Lyman-alpha object . <p> " There have been some preliminary reports that people have seen emission from damped Lyman-alpha objects , but these have not survived follow-up observations , " says Djorgovski . " Up until now , we have never had a direct detection of a galaxy responsible for damped Lyman-alpha absorption . " <p> Several properties of the galaxy , he adds , suggest that it is in the early stages of formation . The evidence strongly supports the notion that damped Lymanalpha systems represent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He and his collaborators , Michael A. Pahre of Caltech , Bechtold , and Richard Elston of the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in La Serena , Chile , reported their work last month at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in San Antonio . <p> Intriguingly , the object also happens to be one of the galaxies found by Steidel 's team that meet the color criterion for a primeval galaxy . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : At a redshift of 2.7 , an unusually bright galaxy ( arrow ) imaged with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope may be primeval . <p> By R.
