What would you pay or risk to see a movie ? In inflation-racked Germany after World War I , people paid for film tickets with lumps of coal . In Paris in 1896 , audiences gasped at one of the very first films , of a train chugging toward the camera . They feared it would crash through the screen , yet were thrilled by the spectacle . <P> A matter of life and death , cinema was an instant sensation . In Europe it attracted not only lifelong fans but also visionary artists . On a par with , or ahead of , directors in the U.S. , they created film art . Color , sound , musical scores , special effects , the chase , the epic , the sequel  --  all were pioneered by Europeans in the early 1900s , long before Americans made movies in a town called Hollywood . <P> Today Hollywood so dominates the film landscape that Americans may think they can ignore work from abroad , whether of the 1990s or the 1890s . Cinema Europe : The Other Hollywood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonpareil team of Kevin Brownlow and David Gill , could upend that notion . Faster than a speeding Twister , more sweeping than Braveheart and , in its insistence on Europe 's artistic superiority , as contentious as an Oliver Stone screed , Cinema Europe will pry open the viewer 's eyes and mind . It is airing five nights this week on cable 's Turner Classic Movies . <P> On Dec. 28 , 1895 , when Louis and August Lumiere showed a Paris audience a brief film of workers leaving a factory , cinema officially began . ( They exhibited the train film a few months later . ) France also nurtured film 's first artist , Georges Melies , a master conjurer who , in the 1900 One Man Band , plays six members of a band and the conductor  --  all in one shot . Melies made color films ; the Germans , in 1905 , made talking pictures . Italians developed the historical epic . The French persuaded Camille Saint-Saens to compose a score for a 1908 film and Sarah Bernhardt to bless the infant medium with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firsts ; the 1920s was a decade of bests , as Europe produced films and filmmakers that were the envy of American producers and art-house audiences . In Sweden , Mauritz Stiller and Victor Sjostrom made sweeping dramas of man in tune with or enslaved by nature . Denmark 's Carl Dreyer shot his heroically austere The Passion of Joan of Arc in France . The Germans boasted Ernst Lubitsch 's puckish historical sagas and Fritz Lang 's grand parables . Lang 's Siegfried had a fire-breathing dragon , a contraption 50 ft. long operated by eight men ; his gigantic , prophetic Metropolis nearly bankrupted its backers . <P> Cinema Europe 's hero is Abel Gance , who in the 1927 Napoleon harnessed an epic delirium unmatched before or since . " Here , " Gance said , " was a new alphabet for the cinema . " But with the entry of talking films that year , the language of silents became as obsolescent as Yiddish . Films got chatty , conservative ; they still are . Most modern directors do n't know Gance 's " alphabet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
