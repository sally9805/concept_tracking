WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED IN INDIA 15 years ago , I used to wonder how it could possibly have happened that a woman from Massachusetts ended up in New Delhi-that someone who hated hot weather could end up in a city where hot meant pizza oven and normal was 115 degrees Fahrenheit . I was miserable for so many years that I just got used to it and learned to function around it . " What you need is work , " my husband would occasionally point out . " Once you find something you can really fling yourself into , your problems will disappear . " " Work ? ! " I would snarl , deliberately misunderstanding him . " Work is the last thing I need . I 've never worked so hard in my life . " This was true . I was a stay-at-home mom , and 1 did most of the housework myself . In India , floors need to be swept and scrubbed ( on hands and knees ) every day , sometimes twice . Clothes are washed by hand ; dusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , no dishwasher , often no electricity . We had no car , no phone , and no convenience foods . I made our yogurt , baked our bread , and churned our butter . My hands were rough and raw , and my mind was numb . All I ever seemed to think about was grocery lists and bleaching diapers . Work was definitely not what I needed . Of course , that is n't what my husband meant . He was n't talking about work in the boring sense of keeping your hands occupied and getting necessary tasks accomplished . He was talking about it as a vocation , that sense of being called . This is what most Catholics grow up with , and it is both a gift and a burden . It is what makes it possible for us to see our work in a larger perspective , but it also makes most of us a bit difficult to please . The saints among us may be able , like Saint Therese of Lisieux , to find God even in the pots and pans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I scrubbed my floors as cheerfully as I could , but the thought did strike me from time to time that America to India was an awfully long way to come to sweep and swab . It is strange , then , that when meaningful work did finally present itself , I accepted it so gracelessly . It took me a long time to understand that God 's plan for me might be different from my own . What I always thought I would do was write . My plan was to change people 's lives through my amazing books . What I actually do is run a school for children with mental handicaps in India . It is work I never would have imagined myself involved in even five years ago . I have neither training nor aptitude in special education , and until recently , I did n't even have an interest . That changed , dramatically and forever , when my own daughter was diagnosed with cerebral palsy . Overnight , with her future ( and mine ) on the line , I discovered a burning interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted someone else to do the work . I spent more than I should have searching for that elusive person who would magically create a special-needs network in our small town because I was determined not to do it myself . Finally , when it was clearer than glass that if I did n't do it , it was n't going to get done , I started the school . The point of this story is that it has a happy ending . I was dragged into this project kicking and screaming , but I can now honestly say that I have never been happier . There is nothing I would rather be doing . I believe that I have discovered the purpose of my existence on earth and I ca n't imagine a more satisfying situation . // I enjoy the work I do . // This is , to me , the essence of the Christian perspective on work : to find a task one has been put here to do , and then to do it . Easier said than done ? Obviously . Our entire culture is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to look for a job with " Seek first the kingdom of heaven " as their guide will find they are swimming against the tide . Around here , we look at salary , vacations , health benefits , pension plans , hours , and perks before making up our minds to take a job or not . These are practical and realistic considerations , but they are not the most important ones . Nor do they really guarantee job satisfaction . It is one of those strange ironies of life that the more carefully we look out for our own interests , the less likely it is that our interests will be served . Everyone knows , or has heard of , the person who seems to have it all-great job , nice family , beautiful home , car , clothes , you name it-but is still unhappy . And we all know someone for whom the opposite is true : very little in the way of possessions but happy nonetheless . On the other hand , there are plenty of people who live very comfortable lives and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people drudging out an existence with hearts full of bitterness and resentment . The key factor is not what we have but what we do . How do we spend our days ? Work is so vital a part of our existence that it is the primary way we identify ourselves . " What do you do ? " we ask each new acquaintance . And although we " do " a hundred different things every day , no one is in doubt as to the meaning of the question . " What do you do ? " means " Tell me who you are . " For Catholics , work is as important a part of life as prayer-indeed , to the Benedictines , work is prayer . We can not take it lightly or frivolously or pretend that our need to pay the bills supersedes our duty to God . This is not to say that we have to give up our careers and go to work in a soup kitchen to be sure we are doing what God expects of us . He himself was a carpenter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well aware that we need to feed our children , pay the rent , meet the mortgage , buy books , and go out on the town . We can work in L.L. Bean or drive a school bus or practice medicine or teach piano or do any of the thousands of things that people " do " - the important thing is how we do them . One of the greatest joys in life is discovering people who shine in the most unexpected corners , people who seem to bring their whole souls to work and radiate it with their own goodness . I once took a bus from Providence , Rhode Island to New York , where I was to board a plane for India . My parents had come to drop me at the station and after saying goodbye , I sat in my seat , just a few rows from the back . As we were pulling out , the bus driver noticed them still standing on the platform , waving forlornly . " Come on up here and wave to them again , " he announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you through that dark glass . " I rushed forward to do it and had the pleasure of seeing their faces light up with surprise . " They looked like they needed one last glimpse , " he said quietly . It was just a small gesture , but it was evidence of the consciousness he brought to his job . I was not just a passenger with a ticket and x number of suitcases who had to be transferred from point A to point B. I was a real human being with parents who loved me and were going to miss me . It happens all the time . There is a woman in the 7-11 where I buy my newspaper who never fails to engage my children in conversation . She has a soft spot for my youngest , the one with cerebral palsy , and always remembers to give her plenty of time to answer her questions . The woman in the library where I go to write leaps up with delight whenever I bother her with a question , as if there is nothing she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Telephone operators can be unbelievably courteous , going out of their way to find information and make connections . There are , of course , people who know exactly what they want to do with their lives and set out to do it.They choose work that serves the community , makes them happy , and pays the bills . They are , perhaps , the blessed ones , and they enrich the rest of us by giving us the chance to see a little piece of heaven on earth . More ordinary souls , whose gifts do not allow them to choose the really interesting jobs , may have to settle for fewer automatic benefits and concentrate on creating their own . Self-interest should hardly be the motivating factor for bringing the Christian ethic to the workplace , but it is a fact that if we work joyfully , happy to go the extra mile , job satisfaction will soar . A glad spirit just seems to draw gladness to it ; I automatically start smiling as I walk into the 7-11 because I know that woman is waiting for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these things shall be added unto you " is not just an idle phrase . It is all the truth there is. // I have trouble balancing work and family commitments .
