<p> PEGGY GALLEN , a nurse-midwife at D.C. General for 19 years , delivered a baby in May . The mother was a 15-year-old giving birth to her second baby , her first child having been born two years earlier . While she was in labor , her boyfriend , the reputed father of the new infant , sat in the delivery room and sucked his thumb . The grandmother , a young woman herself , was too drunk to stay awake during the delivery . <p> " When new-borns are brought into a situation like that , " says Gallen , who finally left D.C. General last month in frustration , " how can you expect to turn it around ? " <p> A critical question for this community  --  but not a new one . Fifteen years ago , when Mayor-elect Marion Barry began his first term , he called the District 's infant mortality rate its " number one health problem . " Nine days after taking office in January 1979 , he called the infant death rate " at best a disgrace and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the capital of the most technologically developed country in the world . " <p> Nothing much has changed since  --  although Barry kept his word and took steps toward reforming the system . Today , surveying the social wreckage of the city , the mayor-elect in an interview last week called for draconian measures  --  including , in some cases , a mandatory five-year contraceptive implant ( Norplant ) for women on welfare . " If you do n't want the government in your business , then you do n't have to ask the government for any money , " Barry says . ( Excerpts from the interview with Barry appear on Page C4 . ) <p> As Barry looks ahead to his next term , he must consider these facts from the little-publicized 1990 Infant Mortality Review Progress Report : the District had " the highest infant mortality rate of any similar geopolitical entity , state , or territory among the United States . . . . Fifteen percent of families live in poverty . . . two thirds are headed by women . The high school drop-out rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and homicide numbers are among the highest of all cities . " <p> But if the news is still bleak , the good news is this : Barry understands as well as anyone that Washington must begin at the beginning by addressing the root causes of the problem  --  women having babies they either do n't intend , do n't want or wo n't take care of . <p> He understands that young girls must be educated not only about sexuality but about drugs , alcohol and cigarettes ; sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) ; and about abuse and violence . They and their boyfriends must be taught about  --  and have access to  --  contraceptives . And if they do get pregnant , they must get adequate prenatal care to ensure that their children are properly fed , immunized and nurtured . <p> You think you 've heard all this before , that the situation is hopeless , right ? In fact , a highly unlikely pair  --  working together  --  could bring about positive change : Marion Barry and Hillary Clinton , longtime activist for children 's rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be great to have that kind of a resource ! " <p> Washington should be a model city , the jewel in the crown . Instead it is a national embarrassment . The 1990 Infant Mortality Review Progress Report said this : " There has been and continues to be , disproportionately high black infant mortality and low birth-weight rates . Indeed the low birth-weight rate , at 16 percent , is almost double the national average . " <p> If this is the 1990 report , imagine what the 1995 report would look like ! Many simply turn away . But the problem is not a liberal-conservative , rich-poor or black-white problem . We are all in this together and , without fixing it , we will all pay the price in more crime , more disease , more children with low cognitive skills and more people being raised to be burdens on society rather than contributors . <p> But how to do it ? <p> In his first term as mayor , Marion Barry put the issue of maternal and child health at the top of his agenda . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave him freedom to deal with the problems as he saw fit . Together they formed a blue ribbon commission on infant mortality and , according to Peg Gallen , " The reason babies are being saved at all is because of that . " <p> " Barry politicized the issue , " says Sarah Brown , of the Institute of Medicine and the co-chairman of the Mayor 's Advisory Board on Maternal and Child Health . " He was willing to get out front on it . " <p> John Scanlon , director of Neonatology at Columbia Hospital for Women , agrees : " Barry recognized right away that this issue was not just medical , it was not just social , and he was always very interested in it . " <p> " This is his issue , " says Tuckson , now presi dent of Charles Drew University of Medicine and Science in South Central Los Angeles . " Marion always said , ' Do it ' without blinking an eye . This is his thing . " <p> Saying " do it " and actually getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different matter than in the early ' 80s . That is particularly the case with a new Republican Congress in an anti-welfare climate , although Barry , in his interview , sees the chance for " empowerment " in a Republican era . He believes that " the welfare system has enslaved the recipients . " <p> Barry says , " You 're torn between punishing the child or punishing the parent . . . . There are 23,000 families on AFDC Aid to Families With Dependent Children . . . . That would be part of our plan  --  that you would have to have a mandatory X-number of hours of parenting classes in order to receive your benefits . " <p> A major obstacle to solving any problem in the District is the stultifying bureaucracy that has broken the spirits of even the most dedicated workers . It did not help that the outgoing mayor , Sharon Pratt Kelly , showed a seemingly inexplicable lack of interest in the problem of maternal and child health . <p> John Scanlon , who has just overseen the spending of $ 365,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apoplectic with frustration . " The District , " he says , " is a large sinkhole . The Department of Human Resources is more self-replicative than DNA . There 's no competence for anything but survival skills . It needs a major overhaul . The Office of Maternal and Child Health is a byzantine structure to maintain the careers of people who have jobs . " <p> Renee Jenkins , the new chief of pediatrics at Howard University Hospital , is just as vehement . " There are too many advisory committees , " she says . " There is a communications and an information gap . " <p> Dealing with the District 's bureaucracy , says Peg Gallen , " is like swimming through pudding . " <p> If Marion Barry has been in this " pudding " before , Hillary Clinton has not . But the former co-chairman of the Children 's Defense Fund is no stranger to the problem . And as the second most visible resident of the city , she could make an enormous difference . " I 'm sure she could probably help attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barry says . <p> If the problem in the District is to be properly addressed , short of closing down the Department of Human Services , a good way to begin is to appoint a " czar " to oversee all maternal and child health problems . " There has to be somebody who has the power of the mayor to cut across all these bureaucracies and has the prestige enough where the private sector and nonprofit sector will respond , " Barry says . <p> Money is clearly a problem . Any major effort will be costly , and sorely-taxed residents will want to know where it comes from . But money is already available in the form of Title 10 grants , Healthy Start money , a $ 53 million grant from NIH to the Georgetown Medical School and more . But none of this money is consolidated . <p> " You have to set up an independent task force , " says John Scanlon . " It has to be pulled out of the District bureaucracy . It has to be responsible to the outside . A czar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can stay focused . " <p> For this czar , no issue is more important than contraception  --  a question that has long been regarded as too controversial for policy makers . " Family planning and contraception have always been a hot potato in this business , " Peg Gallen says , " and people do n't want to make that the principle objective . " <p> But as Sarah Brown points out vividly , " What 's more of a hot potato ? Dead babies or contraception ? I do n't understand what 's controversial about contraception . We have to take back the night on this issue . " <p> Barry , with his advocacy of mandatory Norplant in some cases , has certainly taken a controversial step in that direction . <p> Brenda Cooper , of Planned Parenthood , understands the nature of the controversy . <p> " I run into people who suggest that birth control is genocide , " Cooper says . " But real genocide is having babies when you ca n't take care of them and do n't want them and let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're middle class with ambition and aspirations , that it is wrong to control your fertility . But give a poor woman the same options and suddenly it 's genocide . Why not encourage people with the least resources not to have children ? Constant childbearing gives you no freedom to dream , to plan . " <p> Without strong leadership in this area , you can forget the whole thing  --  or so most people who work in this field believe . <p> " You have got to implement family planning first , " says John Scanlon , definitively . <p> " People who are interested in children 's issues , " says Sarah Brown , " have a long list of things they want to do . . . . Head Start , improved schools , school lunches , anti-violence programs , special ed , health care , pediatric care , immunization . . . but they have been silent on the issue of contraception . We want to make contraception a children 's issue . " <p> Brown points out that these babies are not all " unwanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many are unwanted , she says , and that 's why these children are at special risk  --  their mothers engage in risky behavior and get prenatal care later if at all . <p> " We 're willing as a society to intervene once they are born , " says Brown , " but these women themselves are telling you that they do not want to have these babies . " <p> Brown can not understand why those opposed to abortion are so against family planning . <p> " The abortion issue has spoiled the soup for contraception " she says . " The family planning people have been isolated from the mainstream of child welfare issues and isolated from children 's groups . " <p> The controversy , Brown believes , " gets to the issue of sex . This country is squeamish about sex . But if you talk about contraception you have to talk about sex . The anti-family-planning people will say that to talk about sex only increases sexual activity , but statistics show that good information and services can delay the age of first intercourse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine at Childrens Hospital , acknowledges the controversy . But he stresses the importance of promoting contraception . Condoms , he says , are particularly effective because they also protect against sexually transmitted diseases . <p> " There 's been a dramatic increase of kids with HIV , " D'Angelo says . " In 1987 it was .04 percent and by 1993 it was 3.1 percent . We would like to see a wide availability of condoms . We would like to delay adolescent sexual activity but we need to protect against STDs . That 's why we stress the use of both contraceptives and condoms . " <p> D'Angelo 's clinic has had fairly good success with Norplant because the staff is supportive and skilled at removing the implant from women 's arms . A new , safe IUD , everyone agrees , is not satisfactory because so many of these young girls have 20 or more partners and pelvic inflammatory disease . And pills are not practical because people forget to take them . <p> The current contraceptive of choice is the synthetic hormone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D'Angelo says , " a lot of kids want to get pregnant , for status , for somebody who is theirs , because it is the accepted norm . We have to be supportive of young mothers , but the message needs to be that there is a better way to approach adulthood . " <p> Renee Jenkins at Howard favors Depo Provera and says that despite the regular shots , " the kids I 'm seeing are surprisingly interested in it . It 's not so permanent , " she says . " They have control over it . " She finds herself frustrated by bureaucratic stupidities : " At Ballou High School " she says , " you ca n't get condoms from the school clinic but you can from the school nurse . Now , does that make sense ? " <p> Says Barry , " I have a problem with condoms without the prerequisite educational and counseling functions that go with it . " <p> One of the problems , according to Peg Gallen , is that " young women are menstruating at 10 and 12 now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ovulate until age 15 . Now they 're expected to go 10 years before the first ovulation and sexual relationships or marriage "  --  which she says is n't realistic . <p> Like so many others , Gallen too has been frustrated by the bureaucracy . She cites the 30-day waiting period between signing for a tubal ligation and getting it . " People who need it and want it , " she says , " are down on their knees begging for it , particularly at delivery of an unintended pregnancy . Many of them are addicts , many HIV positive , many suffering from abuse , most with no prenatal care . At delivery they are saying please give it to me , and we make them wait . The next time we see them is at their next delivery . " <p> She adds , " I remember growing up during World War II . Well , this problem is more lethal to our culture than the Nazis ever were . " <p> " The dominant theme of this whole situation , " says Reed Tuckson , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We know what works , the blueprint is there "  --  one-stop shopping , comprehensive and easily accessible services in a single place . " But how do we catch matters early enough so that infant mortality as an issue begins with the sixth-grader who tells her mother what dress she wants to be buried in . " <p> Tuckson thinks Barry is one of the few people who can actually do something . <p> " He has the charisma and the capacity to make it happen . You should hold the mayor accountable and hold each other as a city accountable . At his first meeting of the entire cabinet he should say this is the number one way I 'm going to evaluate you  --  on your success to coordinate to save these babies ' lives . He has to make it so that if you want status in this community , you wo n't get it unless you do something that is related to mentoring children . All these people are just wringing their hands and saying it 's hopeless . Well , it is n't hopeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . " <p> Barry says , " You 've got to be realistic but you 've got to also believe that it can happen if you put the right kind of energy in it and the right kind of people together . You 've just got to . " <p> The Mount Airy Baptist Church is situated right in the middle of one of the most depressed projects in Washington , Sursum Corda , where the annual income is between $ 7,000 and $ 9,000 a year . There , Planned Parenthood 's Brenda Cooper has started a sex education project for girls aged 7 to 12 . Another for the early teens is about to be started and a third , at Dunbar High school down the block , is for young mothers . <p> Overseeing these projects is Philip Johnson , the pastor , who is trying to reach out and make contact . He meets with ministers in the area , and walks the streets of Sursum Corda , talking to teenagers who wo n't come to church . <p> " The only time these girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , sounding much like Marion Barry . " We 're trying to give them a lot of attention now . Our society rewards negative behavior and ignores good behavior . If they get pregnant they are showered with attention and presents and blessings by both boys and society . Then they start getting checks . That 's a trend that has to be changed . They should be rewarded and celebrated for going to school , for not getting pregnant . " <p> The class of " Young Treasures " meets once a week and is conducted by Lenora Sweeny . On this day , there are approximately 10 little girls , some in uniform from a nearby Catholic school , others in jeans . They are polite , interested , excited and embarrassed by the idea of having a guest , reading a new , rather graphic and frank sex book and discussing it in front of a guest . But soon their reserve breaks down ; they are laughing and giggling and telling stories on each other , jumping out of their seats with glee , desperately waving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend of theirs , a l3-year-old , has recently become pregnant . All agree it is a bad thing . They feel sorry for her , they would never do that themselves , they regard her as a " freak . " But then they tell how the boys hang around the playground and get them to play Seven Eleven ( " seven kisses and 11 humps " ) and they begin finger-pointing , who had played and who had not . <p> " They 're so full of light now , ' says Brenda Cooper sadly . " And yet you know that before long that light will get diminished .
