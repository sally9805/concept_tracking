THESE ARE THE FACTS . I know nobody believes in facts anymore . But I believe in them . I still think of them as stones  --  that solid , that capable of causing hurt or heaven . So here they are : Not long ago in the city of La Ceiba on the Caribbean coast of Honduras , an American by the name of August Mueller was arrested attempting to rob a bank . At the time of the holdup Mueller was in possession of a loaded .22 caliber pistol . He died in custody at some undetermined point on the triangular route between the bank and the police station and the prison to which he was remanded by the judge on duty . His body showed no signs of mistreatment . During the incident at the bank , despite his poor Spanish , Mueller made it clear that he was not interested in money . What he wanted , what he was incapable of resisting , what he resorted in vain frustration to violence for , was something else . August Mueller wanted Amethyst . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was why I felt such tremendous sympathy for the dead man , enough to travel to his home in Utica , New York , and then to Honduras , and finally Nicaragua . What I got for my troubles was more facts . I like the word incontrovertible , but I am sensitive to the need not to overuse it . There 's such a thing as a Zeitgeist , is n't there , there 's such a thing as getting on the nerves of irascible skeptics . And from what I 'm able to judge , the balance of power currently tips their way . I 'm a realist . <p> Anyway , here are more facts , unmodified : At his death August Mueller measured five feet nine inches and weighed 312 pounds . He entered Honduras from Guatemala , having driven a bottle-green 1979 VW van down through Mexico . The van 's back window lacked glass ; it was covered in plastic that had shredded in the wind . Inside the police found eleven cases of cat food . There was , however , no sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oddities that caught the attention of the AP stringer in Tegucigalpa , who filed the story about the obese gringo bank robber who did n't want money , dying , as it were , with the word amethyst on his lips . The story focused on the bizarre details  --  Mueller 's obesity , the cat food , the fact that he held up a bank but not for money , the small mystery of his death . You can imagine the piece the stringer produced , and why U.S. editors chose to run it in their newspapers . Reading it generated a mixture of pathos and wonder . I too was fascinated with August Mueller 's death , but for a different reason . <p> A few years ago in Mozambique , when it came on , I refused to admit to myself that the evil attacking my body was malaria . I was working with maimed war veterans in a Portuguese-sponsored program that provided prosthetic devices for all those who lost limbs and other body parts for political reasons , regardless of their own take on the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job ; it reassured me that I had done the right thing getting out of the public relations business . I was weary of images , and of the uses to which clever people put images , and of tracking how targeted sets and subsets of people responded to the manipulation of images . It 's a whoresome trade , finally , from which I was lucky to escape with my life . I was happy working both with the Mozambicans and with prostheses . I was not a candidate for malaria . I had been giving my prophylactic tablets away to a woman whose need , it seemed to me , was greater than mine . <p> When I became delirious , the Portuguese doctor who headed the project sent me to a small clinic on the coast run by an internationalist order of nuns whose slogan , rehearsed in many languages , had something to do with practical mercy . To a person they were extraordinary women . It gives me pleasure to recall them . They had no use for dogma , no doubt of the God whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scruples about taking pleasure in good sistership and good conversation and good wine . They flapped and chattered , flying through my delirium like birds of the most momentous annunciation . The old Landcruiser in which I had ridden from the village where I was stricken had no shock absorbers . Every jolt over every hole in the terrible roads we traveled had sent me a little deeper into the heart of hurting . Eventually my pain and my imagination merged . They became the same place , which was the only place , my very own terrible place and self . <p> In my denial I had foolishly allowed myself to dehydrate , which aggravated an already serious condition . The nuns were always bringing me pleasant things to drink : fruit juices , cold soda pop , herbal teas . In fact , it was the furious boiling whistle of the teakettle on the gas ring one night that drew me out of a funk in which I was discussing with a spotted gray rat with shaggy fur whether I wanted the pain to go away badly enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie shaking me awake to pour tea down my dry gullet . Jan Marie was a Kansan with perfectly round breasts and muscular forearms covered with fine blond hair who grieved continuously , I think I remember , for the loss of the RSE Bible ; all that good language homogenized over time to exhortatory pabulum . But it was n't she . <p> " Get out of bed and come for a walk , " I heard . " The nuns have been babying you more than you have any right to . " <p> I got out of bed . I know adjectives are presently out of favor , but I find no alternative to using them to describe her . Diaphanous , if the word can be applied to a body , though I also mean numinous . The darkness of the night was tinctured by moonlight from over the ocean . She seemed to collect and hold the light the way a pitcher holds liquid , containing but not spoiling it . She wore a tawny robe of a coarse fabric that trailed on the sand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing , was held back by a half-turban of the same fabric , in the manner women have of wrapping towels around their heads after a shower . Her face was a thin oval in constant motion to reflect the mood of the moment , which she rode like a wave . Her teeth were unusually small , or her lips were a bit too big for the face . Her beauty was singular , not traditional . She was her own design . <p> " Shall we walk ? " It was not really a question . <p> " I have malaria . " <p> " You also have legs . " <p> I walked next to her on my sick legs , which tottered less than I expected . The moon had passed its high point . It faltered toward the horizon , pearling as it went the tops of the waves that broke on the cool white sand of the beach . Over our heads , the stars of the southern hemisphere asserted their patterns against the black , which had a purple cast and the texture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she told me . " You 're a real piece of work . " <p> " I did n't treat it soon enough . " My hands trembled , but I felt no embarrassment  --  which seemed unusual . <p> " I 'm not talking about the malaria . " <p> I knew she was n't but was not about to admit that . My position was weak , and I felt defensive . <p> " One is either a quester or he is n't , " she pointed out . " Going back and forth in all that anxiety unstrings a person . You , for instance : you are completely unstrung . Why should I want to spend time in your company ? " <p> " I want a guide , " I told her , changing tactics and opting for candor . " I get sidetracked too easily . " <p> The shrill peal of laughter I had to endure made me regret my honesty , but I knew that too much game-playing might make her run away . And I wanted her to stay . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay : to be there on the Mozambican beach with her watching the moon-pearled waves and smelling the sea and feeling the desire rise inside me like a new taste that was the same old taste . <p> " It 's not a road rally , " she told me . <p> " It 's a condition , " I ventured . " It 's the way a person wants . " <p> " Metaphysics bores me , " she warned , skipping ahead suddenly so that I had to run to keep up . Being bedridden had sapped my strength , and fifty yards winded me . <p> " I 'll be simple and direct , " I said when I caught her . <p> " One more obvious ploy . " She shook her head . <p> " Better a ploy than metaphysical categories , " I countered , and the shaking-off gesture she made with her shoulders and arms and back meant she was going to listen . <p> " I used to know you , " I said . " But I forgot you . Now all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to remember the rest of the things I forgot , and I want to be your lover . A person forgets . He ca n't help it . " <p> " My most favored lover , no doubt , " she sniffed . <p> " I admit that . " <p> " You 're a slow learner , are n't you ? I mean you 're not naturally gifted in that way . " <p> " Does that disqualify me ? " <p> She shook her head vehemently . " What disqualifies you is asking too many questions , and asking the wrong questions , and not understanding the answers when I give them to you . You 've been that way from the beginning . " <p> " Will you take me as your lover ? " <p> The naked , simple question seemed to take her by surprise . Not that she was disarmed by it , but I was pretty certain I had managed to touch her . I was ready to call that a victory , however minor . But at the same moment several large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough moon left to silver their bodies during their brief leap into the purple-black air , and something in the arc of their fall made me realize that even if she stayed with me all night and we watched the sun come up together with sand between our toes , I would do nothing but compound error upon error . And she would take pleasure in staying several steps ahead of me , and my longing would intensify beyond bearing , and I would lose what I did n't even have . <p> I believe that what happened then was physical . I mean that the kiss and taste of clean saliva , the caress in exploratory outline of her body 's secret shape , the blinding flush of blood , the cornmeal smell of her skin , were actual . Not symbolic or illustrative , not figurative or divisible or reducible to abstraction . <p> " I remember now , " I said . <p> " Good . " <p> " Your name is Amethyst . " <p> I knew better than to ask when she would be back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the clinic decided the disease had passed its peak . He too was a war victim . His left leg below the knee had been obliterated when he stepped on a land mine on a visit to his home village . He 'd been carrying a sackful of small consumer goods for family and friends . Neither the sack nor the items in it were found after the explosion , though he claimed never to have lost consciousness , even when the pain was at its most excruciating . His prosthesis was one of the first produced by the project on which I was employed . The doctor 's photograph had appeared in newspapers around the world  --  the device prominently , almost aggressively on display  --  after a Belgian photographer snapped him without warning . Copies of the picture hung , edges curling , everywhere I turned , both at the clinic and at our headquarters in the capital . Seeing them made me irritable . My feelings about images had not changed . I was tired of them . They grated on me , irritated my eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly to mend . There were lapses and relapses , of course . I tried hard not to associate my regression with the return of Amethyst . I could not say with any certainty then  --  much less now-that her visitations coincided with a downswing in my recovery . I wanted to know , and I did n't want to . I believe you will understand the ambivalence . <p> After Mozambique I returned to the United States , though not to public relations . Such a noisy place I found it . All the electronic chatter knocked me off kilter . I drifted , with a kind of limp . The wife from whom I had separated had found a permanent replacement in my absence , which relieved me of one complexity . Living alone  --  I consoled myself  --  I was unencumbered . Amethyst had told me a person was either a quester or he was n't . I worked in stretches , stopped working in stretches . I moved around the country on the pretense of looking for regional authenticity . Really I was on the lookout for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images would fade ; going back to my previous line of work would be the simplest solution to the problem of drift . But on another level I rejoiced at my intractability . This too I believe you will understand . <p> I was just smart enough to know I could not simply call Amethyst . I could n't conjure her . Nor could I hang suspended like a windsurfing idiot waiting for a visitation when I least expected it . In my idleness I gamed . I spent hours doing Internet searches combining the word amethyst with other words I thought might yield a clue , a connection , a direction . At first the searching intrigued me . I learned interesting facts about things I had not known existed . With time , however , I was overwhelmed by how much flotsam and jetsam was out there bobbing on the sea of human knowledge . It was trash ; it was dross ; it was worthless . It was not the way to find precious stones . <p> One day , not conscious of what I was doing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and typed the following : You 're not a scholar , you 're a lover . The relief that seeing that declarative sentence on the otherwise blank screen brought me was incalculable . A doubt was cleared up without my having to worry it through . Not long after that  --  very likely my losing track of time was deliberate , if unconscious  --  I read the AP story about the strange death of August Mueller in Honduras . <p> Doing a little sleuthing by telephone , I located his family in Utica . When I called , his older sister  --  August 's closest surviving kin  --  agreed to talk to me . I had the impression that she 'd been waiting for the call . I understood why when she opened the door into her upstairs duplex and invited me in for coffee . Nancy Mueller was a large woman , uneasy with her bulk as though continually finding herself with more body than space in which to put it . She had done her hair in anticipation of the visit , and there were pussy willows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue Buffalo Bills sweatshirt with the number 32 highlighted in red letters . <p> " We 've got to be Bills fans in this part of the country , " she apologized , shrugging her broad shoulders . " They 're the closest NFL team we 've got . " <p> She asked my permission to smoke in her house . She said she smoked to eat less , then ate more as a response to worrying about lung cancer . Lighting the match , her hands shook . " He was n't crazy , " she told me . " My brother August . " <p> " I did n't think he was . " <p> It was obvious that I was telling the truth . I did my best to put her at ease . Reflexively she topped off my mug of coffee . Over two hours of stop-and-go conversation , I learned that August Mueller had never owned a cat , that he 'd spent time in Nicaragua during the Sandinista revolution , that his weight ballooned out of control while he was in Managua . And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he contracted malaria , after which he was a changed man . When he returned to Utica he no longer fit in . People made jokes . He was oblivious to the clownish impression he made on them , but August perceived the meanness directed at him and was hurt . Without warning he quit his job in a box factory , bought the VW van , and told his sister he was going to Central America . <p> " That 's all he said ? " <p> " He made some kind of joke I did n't get . By that time I 'd quit trying to follow him when he went off on his wacko tangents . He said malaria was the healthiest disease on earth , and he was one of the lucky ones that got it . He said he would n't trade it for any disease they offered him , not for money . " <p> When I thanked her and got up to leave , she asked when I thought the media would get there . <p> " What media ? " <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been described as sheepish . Ever since the newspaper piece , it turned out , Nancy Mueller had been expecting the media to show up on her front lawn with boom microphones and light batteries . There was enough in her brother 's story , in her opinion , to draw the scandal sheets , the talk-show hosts , vested photographers in ill-mannered swarms . <p> " When you called , " she confessed , " I thought you were the first one . " <p> What I did not push her to admit was that she wanted the news people to come . I acted charitably only because the connection was so apparent between what she thought should happen and the images that had corrupted her imagination . The easy assumption was that she 'd been watching too much television . She was a victim , but it was not my job to point that out . It seemed to me that what she wanted was to attain image status herself . <p> " I 'm not a journalist , " I told her . I held back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So I went to Honduras . I found La Ceiba lost in a dream of its pre-flood self . Being there , walking its streets , created the impression that anything that mattered to people had already happened , on the farthest edge of living memory , and what counted now was sorting it out . And that would take time . An alert person heard this preoccupation in the soft fall of heavy leaves from tropical plants onto the damp , spongy earth . The city fed on reminiscence and reflection . When people talked about the banana companies , there was more wistfulness than resentment in their wave-washed voices . <p> I interviewed everyone I could find who had seen August Mueller dead or alive , or who claimed to have seen him . I told them I was a researcher without specifying what sort of research I conducted , and no one challenged me . I am sure that three-quarters of what I heard was made up by people who wanted , for reasons obscure to me , to please the visitor whose low-grade Spanish sounded strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I learned little . The police chief , a black man with hollow cheeks and large , tired eyes , offered to take the bus with me to the American Embassy in Tegucigalpa , where he was convinced we would find the lie detector that would absolve him of all responsibility for Mueller 's death . Not necessary , I assured him . I was not a private detective . <p> I have no way of knowing whether the one interesting thing I heard in La Ceiba was true . I was sitting on the balcony of my hotel room , looking down into the pleasantly green interior patio where a squad of weak-legged kittens cuffed at each other 's faces and a brown-legged woman in a yellow dress smoked a cigarette while she swept the day 's litter of paper and orange peels . An extremely thin man in a freshly pressed powder-blue suit came into the patio , shaded his eyes with both hands , and looked up to my window . I noticed that the toes of his blue shoes were absurdly pointed , and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew about people like him . He was a small-time influence peddler , venal and imaginative in a way that lowered the faculty ; he knew from their faces the prices of the people he dealt with . Somewhere close by he would have left the shabby briefcase he took to formal meetings with people of authority , in front of whom his obsequious manner knew no bounds . When he fixed on my face , he leered . <p> " The fat man , " he called . " The one you are researching . " His voice insinuated that he and I had something in common . We did not . I stood up to go inside . <p> " Invite me up , " he suggested . <p> I shook my hand slowly several times . <p> He shrugged . " Suit yourself . I just wanted you to know : the fat man , the one that robbed the bank , he died of a broken heart . " <p> It was possible that the police chief sent him with the message , still worried that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can produce no evidence to document this except the certainty I felt as I watched him turn and leave the hotel patio , humming offensively . The sweeping woman hung on her broom and watched him go . He was acting , as he always acted , as an intermediary . For a commission . In this case it would be a ludicrously minor sum . Or perhaps he was paying off a favor he thought he owed someone . His motivation matters less than the conviction I had that in one way or another he was speaking the truth . <p> I took the thin man 's visit as a sign that it was time to leave Honduras . A person could become distracted in La Ceiba . Months , even years , could pass contemplating the next move . I booked a flight to Managua , where picking up August Mueller 's track was much more difficult . <p> I knew from his sister that August had believed passionately in the virtue and the moral rightness of the revolution . In 1979 , when Somoza fled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contribution . Many idealistic U.S. citizens felt the same . He did not get on an airplane and act on his commitment until the end of 1980 , however . Good with languages , he was assigned a job as a translator of Party documents and lived among the working poor in a barrio whose residents had , to a person , joined the Sandinista neighborhood organization designed to oversee and solidify the revolution 's local progress . It was there that his weight began to be a problem . It was there , Nancy thought , that he got the malaria . Finding that barrio , after all these years , was going to be nearly impossible . <p> That was one reason I decided to stay in the Hotel Intercontinental . If I was going to spend my days tromping through the comfortless sections of the city , I wanted a little ease to return to . I also liked imagining who might have stayed in my room during the war years : Bianca Jagger might well have spent a night sharing a joint with Daniel Ortega . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressionable Swedish fellow-traveler , allowing her to confess the guilt she felt for her country 's indifference , the world 's complicity , before inscribing himself decisively in her private history book . <p> For three days I walked street by street through neighborhoods that looked like the sort of places to which fellow-travelers might have been assigned back in the days of the revolution . Again I told people I was a researcher , and again no one challenged me . Everywhere I walked , I showed the picture Nancy Mueller had given me of her brother , taken at the time of his Nicaraguan sojourn . I asked people if they remembered any neighborhood whose residents had distinguished themselves by their too percent commitment to the Sandinistas ' block organization . I admit it was a stupid question . <p> I tracked down lots of leads , but none led anywhere . There had been so many fellow-travelers , and they had stayed so little time . Even with the photo before them , people found it hard to bring back a single overweight gringo with a placid smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading books about the revolution  --  passionate analyses , mostly , of why it went wrong . <p> Already by the second night I was aware of the Indian-featured man staring at me from the opposite side of the bar . I was mentally tired . I shut him out . Though there was nothing specific to dislike in him , as there had been with the thin man in the blue suit , he troubled me . I frowned when I looked up and found him trying to catch my eye . <p> The third night he came to my table and sat down without an invitation . <p> " There are plenty of free tables in here , " I snapped . " I 'd like a little privacy , if you do n't mind . " <p> After three days of intensive effort , I was no closer to finding August Mueller 's Managua family than I was when I arrived . It was late spring by my body clock . The city 's muggy heat was insufferable . After five minutes ' tromping , my clothes hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Indian , who had sat down , waved one strong hand easily in my direction as if to reassure me that he was willing to overlook my rudeness . <p> Porfirio Quispe was a hard man to dislike . His habitual expression of tempered optimism made me think of the way Native Americans north and south might have looked five hundred years ago watching Europeans row ashore for the first time . He was a huge man , easily six foot six . The sharp , sculpted lines of his face contributed to the impression of severity with which he tended to overwhelm a person . In a bar fight you would not want to look up and see Porfirio on the other side . I watched his huge umber hands slide the rubber band from a plastic portfolio he 'd placed on the round table between us . He drew out a sheaf of papers , on which figured a quantity of sealing wax and ribbons and inky stamps . <p> " I am the president of an important preservation society , " he informed me . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him , proud despite myself of rattling out a reasonable sentence intended to put him off . <p> It was as though I had n't said a word . " It may interest you to know that you address Porfirio Quispe , President of the American Society for the Preservation and Propagation of Indigenous Tongues . " He pointed to the letterhead on the sheet of vellum on top of the stack . The society 's logo was a black condor aloft with a flowering green branch in its talons . <p> I gave up fighting him . My book on the revolution-that-fizzled was boring me . I felt as though there were pockets of air in my head swelling and preventing me from completing my thoughts . I was dull and discouraged and directionless . So I listened with disguised relief to Porfirio 's pitch . He was an Aymara from the Bolivian Altiplano . As a child he had suffered from dreams that resisted interpretation . By the time he reached early manhood , however , he learned to interpret them sufficiently to understand he 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safeguarding of indigenous tongues . So he bit the American road , traveled to every country . He collected dictionaries , developed networks , gave sermons . Developing his political skills , he nurtured the establishment of chapters of the society in every American nation . What he needed to complete his life 's work was funding for a dictionary . The idea was to use emerging computer technology to create what would be , in effect , a seamless web of interactive translation from language to language . <p> " Take the word earth , " he explained . As though it were a gift of great price , he gave me , formally , the term in Aymara , in Quechua , then in Guarani . " When you ask the computer for the word earth , you will be able to start with the language of the Ache , if you like , and move across the landscape of the language in whatever direction you please . You can wind in and out , up and down , back and forth through time zones and topographical delineations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patterns , find the connections , draw your own conclusions . It will be three-dimensional . It will work like a map , if you can picture a map that moves backward and forward in time . But it 's all there : the mountains , the high plains , the big brown rivers . The whole American hemisphere . It 's all there in the words , in the connections between the words . " <p> I listened for a long time . I had no intention of writing him a check , but I doubt that was his intention in fixing on me . I felt no need to speculate on Porfirio 's motivation . The main thing was he distracted me in a moment when I needed distraction . I slept a little easier that night , and I woke refreshed with a sense that I might that day have luck , might come upon a trace of August Mueller . <p> I did n't . I spent the next three days walking the streets of Managua 's many poor neighborhoods , talking to residents and showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something odd was happening in the world around me . It was changing in a way I had no experience of . The sunlight began to thicken , almost to coagulate . I could see it in the air , feel it around me , like a progressive slowing-down , as though time itself had downshifted . And as the light clotted it became a kind of ambergris , trapping the visible in its viscous prison : a woman with bandaged knees in a blue dress hauling a bucket of water up from a neighborhood well ; a girl cooking tortillas in a Chevy hubcap ; a three-legged yellow dog with strings of white slobber falling from its mouth ; a boy with black eyes in a terrorized face , slapping a stick against the slats of a fence as though to gain the attention of someone who was not available . <p> At the same time the air congealed , it also began to smell different . My nostrils absorbed a powerful compound odor of sulfur and burning oil , of fish and dandelions , all sorts of things I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them seemed familiar , almost intimate , the way that memory is intimate and singular , not replicable . <p> All of that  --  the thick light and the thickly smelling air  --  had its effect on me . I felt my body begin to slow down on its own . I lost my sense of purpose , the certainty of mission . My mind made an intriguing burring noise . Lassitude , I told myself , was not so much a condition of sin as a precondition of rest . I did not think then , nor do I think now , that what happened to me meant I was breaking down . <p> " You 're not looking well , " Porfirio told me in the bar one evening . <p> " Did you have any luck ? " I asked . When he seemed puzzled I told him I wondered whether he 'd collected any money for his dictionary that day . <p> He shook his head , but not in answer to my question . " You better stay out of the sun for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What has happened to you ? " <p> " In my case it was after I came down with malaria . I got the kind that is n't supposed to recur , but ... " He shook his head . <p> " When did you have malaria ? " I asked him . <p> I thought the question must have offended him , from the brushing-off gesture he made first with his hands , then his shoulders , and then with his whole massive body . I do n't have clear recall of what happened then , what he might have said or I might have said . My recollection always fixes on the same spot : a grassy field in Managua where the debris of a building that had fallen in the 1972 earthquake lay spread through the high , weedy grass like genuine archaeological ruins , as though we had stumbled across the stone proof of an ancient civilization . In reality it was only the testament to sadness and insufficiency . They had been unable to rebuild their city , so they lived their revolution and counterrevolution in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for almost all his adult life . <p> In the rare white light of a splendid moon , three-quarters full , Porfirio placed a bottle between us on the hunk of rock on which he 'd suggested we sit . Curious in a passive way , I asked what it was . On a smaller , less imposing person his grin would have been mischievous . On Porfirio it was comradely and conspiratorial , and it made me feel easy . <p> " This is the real thing , " he told me . " This is a full bottle of autochthonous beverage . " <p> " What is it for ? " I admit the question was disingenuous . <p> " It 's for drinking , " he told me , happy enough to play along . His big shoulders went up and down when he laughed . His laugh was the cleanest , most liberating human noise I remember hearing in my life . <p> So we drank it . It burned , going down , like triple-distilled whiskey . The burn did not disguise the taste , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can come is to say that Porfirio Quispe 's autochthonous beverage tasted like electricity , if you could drink electricity and survive and your tongue remembered . <p> Many things went away then . Porfirio was among them . For a while I felt uneasy , being alone , as though the man I 'd come to consider a friend had set me up for something dangerous , then disappeared before there were any consequences to be paid . I was hollow inside , an empty drum . After my second drink I felt the time lurch forward , as if to make up the pace it had dropped a few days earlier when the light clotted across Managua and I felt the bleak impossibility of locating the place where August Mueller had stayed during his revolutionary period . <p> With my third drink I realized it was not Porfirio 's job to keep me company . I was a fool . That helped a little , though the certainty of being vulnerable only intensified . At that point I became more interested in what was happening . It was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body remembering before your mind did that you had a destination , and that your destination was not to be avoided . Neither passive nor quite active , I moved through stages of giddiness , and then a kind of intense bodily rocking , and finally into a tremulous calm . When I looked up , I saw the mountains on the moon . They were brown , and they reminded me of the imperious need for loneliness in a person 's life . And then across the grass , which was blue and resilient in the moonlight , here came Amethyst . <p> " Wipe that smug expression off your face , " she ordered . I wiped it off with my hand , pleased with , my own smartass gesture . <p> " Where is Porfirio ? " I asked her . <p> " You of all people do n't need to bother yourself about Porfirio Quispe , " she said . I had n't known I was opening myself up to a rebuke that stung . Porfirio , her tone suggested , would make out fine without my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher order of being . <p> " I ca n't live without you , Amethyst . " <p> " Of course you ca n't . " <p> " What I mean to say is that I need to figure out how to stay in touch with you . More frequently . When I do n't see you I go crazy . Right now I 'm fine . I 'm the best I 've been since the last time I saw you back in Mozambique . But if you go away again ... " <p> " Shall we walk ? " <p> Walking across the shattered ruins of Managua was very different from walking the white beaches of Mozambique , but  --  in Amethyst 's company  --  no less pleasant . Her arm in mine , I started with the frantic sensation of having to prolong the walk forever . If it meant drinking another bottle of autochthonous beverage , I would slug it down without thinking . If cunning was required , I would be cunning . I would be entertaining , or pathetic , or whatever it took . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed differently this time . Her off-white dress was shorter , and she wore shoes . She might have come from an office somewhere , out of a meeting of bureaucrats . There was no reason it should , but the change threw me off . <p> " This obsession of yours with images , " she told me . " I find it childish . You 're posing . You think you can recover some sort of primal innocence . Well , you ca n't . " <p> Listening , I realized I 'd wanted her to admire my stand . I wanted her to find in my rejection of the tyranny of images enough that was heroic and individual that she would see me as a man worth spending time with . Probably it was looking good in Amethyst 's eyes that drove me to my extreme position in the first place . " That 's what killed August Mueller , is n't it , " I asked her on a hunch . " I mean , he let all the images get to him . " Why had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me so much anxiety , so much time . <p> " August was a sweet and gentle lover , but he could n't live in the world . And that 's where he had to live , is n't it ? " <p> " What about the cat food ? " <p> The question made her angry . As usual , I had overplayed my hand . Having gained her confidence , I presumed a bond between us that she would n't acknowledge even if it existed . I was not sure it did . Anyway , Amethyst was not a woman on whom a person presumed . The swift stride with which she left me behind was not a game . She was ready to abandon me , likely for good . I could not avoid thinking of her other lovers , and jealousy sent a sour current through my body , which was pneumatic with expectation and desire . <p> " Wait ! " I called . <p> I was lucky . She stopped , turned slowly and spoke . Her words lacerated . " It 's not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a mistake . You know I make mistakes . " <p> " So what do you want from me ? " Her impatience was as real and as necessary , it occurred to me as I stood watching the fury with which she balled and unballed her fists , as my blind desire to be around her . Overhead , the moon had stopped moving . In its bland white eye Amethyst was more beautiful than I had seen her before . Somewhere a long way off a car horn honked . All the rest of the city noises were pulled away from us on a treacherous undertow of sound . <p> " A present , " I told her . " that 's what I want from you . " <p> She nodded . " Sometimes you tire me out . " <p> " That 's my fault , " I acknowledged . " It 's a personality flaw . " <p> " A present ? " <p> I nodded . <p> " Fuck with your body , " she told me , " think with your heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved close enough to embrace and kiss her , to run my fingers through her crow's-wing hair and clown the tiny bones of her back following the elemental curve there , to clench her close and smell her skin and lick the shine of sweat , did I understand that I too was capable of giving gifts . And that her wanting one from me was natural and normal and also a source of wonder . <p> " Thank you , " she told me . <p> This time I did not try to stop her when she walked away over the blue grass that gave delicately as she stepped on it . My mouth opened , but there was no sound in my throat to expel , just empty air . <p> There was no need to stay in Managua after that . Besides , the city discouraged me : all those ruins , those piles of rubble , all the dusty neighborhoods of poor people on the most precarious edge . It looked permanent . It was time to go . <p> Checking out of the Intercontinental , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a restful night 's sleep . If there is such a thing as an optimistic body , he had one . We stood for a few moments under an awning in front of the hotel , through which the sun managed to penetrate . The light was inexorable . It outlined the determination and the humor in the Bolivian 's handsome face . <p> " You take care of yourself , " he scolded me in older-brother fashion . <p> " I will . " <p> " It can flare up anytime , you know . " <p> " I know . " <p> He put out his hand , and I shook it . <p> My taxi driver honked . His cab was blocking the accessway into the hotel . Behind him , the driver of a black car with polarized windows and official plates was unwilling to wait . There was somebody important in his backseat . <p> " Where do you go from here ? " I asked Porfirio . I knew I was going to miss him and hoped he would also miss me . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . " He shook his head . " The Tupi Guarani are committing suicide at a terrifying rate . In the south . Sign of the times , I guess . I 'm afraid they 'll take all their words with them when they go . Then my dictionary will be incomplete . It has to be complete . It has to be perfect . Listen , about the malaria ... " <p> But I was afraid , for some reason , to hear my friend 's final words on the subject of the disease that had ravaged us . We shook hands a second time , as though we had both forgotten the first , and he handed me into the taxi . I went to the airport . I went home to look for a satisfactory way to make my living . I guess I agree with August Mueller , whose ability to sustain his love was less than it had to be . About the malaria , that is . I was one of the lucky ones . I got it .
