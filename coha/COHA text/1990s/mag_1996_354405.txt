WASHINGTON WAS SHUT down by snow , Congress and the White House were locked in budget combat , and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor last week was talking about ... bananas . Kantor announced a cease-fire in a yearlong imbroglio with banana producers Colombia and Costa Rica . In the past , he said , the two countries had joined with the 12-nation European Union to create trade policies that have hurt American commercial interests . Never mind that few bananas are grown in the U.S. or that only a handful of American jobs was at stake . Forget too that major U.S. producers Del Monte and Dole Foods want no part of the immediate spat . After noting he was ruling out sanctions against the transgressors for now , Kantor announced the two Latin American countries had agreed to urge free-market policies on Europe to open up the global banana trade . <P> The story might have been just another ho-hum item in the trade newspapers , except for a striking fact . One company  --  and one man  --  stood to gain more than anyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Carl Lindner , 76 , a Cincinnati , Ohio , real estate , insurance and banana tycoon who likes to boast of his friendships with U.S. Presidents and sometimes blusters about what his political connections can do for him . For more than two years , Lindner has showered money on some of the biggest names in Congress , Democrats and Republicans alike . At the same time , Lindner , whose empire is worth an estimated $13 billion , has worked tirelessly to get Washington 's help in changing the fortunes of his well-known Chiquita Brands banana company , which lost $346 million between 1992 and 1994 and was barely in the black in 1995 . <P> Kantor aside , no one has championed Lindner 's cause more enthusiastically than Bob Dole . In recent months Dole has twice pressed for congressional action against Colombia and Costa Rica and tried unsuccessfully to attach a rider to the stalled budget bill that would place sanctions on those countries unless they pulled out of the European pact . TIME has learned that Dole has persuaded several congressional leaders to include language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the European Union in the report that accompanies any final budget agreement . Dole insists that standing up for Lindner is simply good policy . A spokesman for the majority leader 's office argues that his " efforts on behalf of free and fair trade have nothing to do with his campaign activities . " <P> Maybe not , but Lindner has long been a generous political bankroller . He and his companies lavished $1.3 million on G.O.P. committees from 1988 through 1994 , while putting $625,000 in Democratic coffers . Lindner 's holding company , American Financial Group , gave an additional $140,000 to the Republicans in the first half of 1995 , and handed $40,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee last October , just as Dole was pushing Chiquita 's interests in Congress . Lindner also contributed $100,000 to Dole 's now defunct Better America Foundation , which helped launch his presidential bid .
