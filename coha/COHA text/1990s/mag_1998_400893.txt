Wee asked Dr. Felicia Cosman at Helen Hayes Hospital in New York about osteoporosis , a condition that makes bones weak and susceptible to fracture . It can be triggered by lack of weightbearing exercise along with nutritional deficiencies , and it is known to affect women after menopause due to changes in hormone levels . Risk is especially high for women who are small-boned , sedentary , extremely thin , and who smoke , drink excessively , or have osteoporosis in the family . Dr. Cosman is investigating osteoporosis in women and men with MS in a Society-funded research project . " Anyone with MS may be at risk for osteoporosis , " Dr. Cosman said . " Both men and women often have mobility and fatigue problems that make doing weightbearing exercise unlikely or impossible . Those who are heat-sensitive stay out of the sun , which could mean a lack of Vitamin D , and steroid drugs , routinely prescribed to shorten attacks , impact on the vitamin-hormone-mineral balances that keep bones healthy " Osteoporosis in MS is a secondary problem . So are falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for now , broken bones are a problem no person with MS needs ! Prevent it , detect it , treat it " Adequate calcium is the key to prevention . Both men and women with MS should get 1200 mgs of calcium every day . There 's an easy way to estimate intake . Count each helping of a dairy food as 300 and add 200 for trace calcium from other sources , like green vegetables . So if you drink a glass of nonfat milk at every meal , you 're only 100 mgs short at the end of day , and a supplement will bring you home . Increasing foods rich in calcium is also a good way to improve diet generally . " For women after menopause , HRT ( hormone replacement therapy ) is an effective prevention . There is no reason to rule it out for women with MS , unless the woman has had phlebitis or blood clot problems . It might even turn out that estrogen helps control the underlying MS . The new " designer " estrogen eliminates some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on bone mass . " Osteoporosis has no symptoms , unless you count a fracture . Any person who has broken a bone in adulthood and every woman with MS at menopause should have a bone scan . This is a painless , noninvasive exam that will enable your physician to measure bone mass , prescribe treatment if needed , and see how that treatment progresses . " Today , treatment with HRT , for women , or a powerful new non-hormonal drug , alendronate ( Fosamax ) , for either sex will likely help prevent further deterioration of the skeleton and reduce the likelihood of future fractures .

I pulled my blanket completely over my head as soon as I realized the brightness was affecting my sleep . I did n't want to get up today . I just did n't . I was tired . Not physically tired ( although working a full-time job while putting together an elaborate wedding is draining ) , but tired on the inside . Tired of people expecting things from me , tired of people asking if I can do things for them , automatically assuming I 'll do it . T-i-r-e-d , tired ! I sneaked a quick peek at the clock . Twenty more minutes until the alarm was set to go off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to please . <p> I do n't usually consider myself a people pleaser . In fact , I would describe myself as strong and independent . But lately , I 've been taking on more and more . I do n't know , maybe all of this can be traced back to my upbringing-the people-pleasing part , that is . It 's what my mother prides herself on , although she likes to call it being a peacemaker ... a unifier ... a real leader . My mother , Ernestine , is the one everybody goes to when somebody needs something : time , help , money ( especially money ) , and everything in between . She 's the one who takes care of the family-immediate , extended , and those who merely call themselves family . She forever places herself last on the list , which normally means there 's nothing left when her turn finally rolls around . And at fifty-two that 's what 's slowly taking a toll on her . It 's not the high blood pressure and cholesterol her doctor has her taking pills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above her own is what 's dragging her down . <p> Well , I 've decided at age twenty-eight that my mother 's fate will not be mine , no matter how much people claim I 'm just like her . I want a lot out of life , and I do n't intend to put my goals on the back burner . I just need to figure out how to say no to things I do n't want to do and stick with it after I say it . <p> Those two letters- n and o - when knitted together form a definitive answer . But for some reason I 've not been able to make them work for me effectively . Sure , I may start with the n but it will invariably come out as , " Now ? " or " N ... oh , you really want me to ? " Or worse : " No problem . " <p> Two days ago my friend Nae-nae called and gave me a chance to test just how far I 'd come with this " saying no " business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that I absolutely ca n't change , " Nae-nae began , calling me by the nickname reserved and used only by a few family members and my closest of friends . " Can you take my mother to the grocery store for me tomorrow ? " <p> " No , " I said firmly , fighting off my normal knee-jerk reaction to add something else to it in the form of some type of acceptable excuse . <p> " No ? " she said as though I had no right to ever say that . " What do you mean , no ? " <p> " I have some things I need to do myself , " I said as I began to slip back into my usual role of not wanting anyone to be upset with me because I 'd dared not please them . <p> She laughed . " Oh ! Is that all ? Well , you can just take her after you finish what you have to do . It 's not like she has to be at the grocery store at a certain time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should n't be out too late at night . Come on , Peaches , you know I do n't have anyone else to help me out . I 've always been able to count on you . Please do n't start being like everybody else and let me down now . Pleeeaaase ? " she whined . <p> " Okay , fine . I 'll take her , " I said even quicker than I suspected I would . She thanked me and hurried off the phone . I had caved in yet again . <p> What I should have said was , " Well , if your mother does n't have to be there at a certain time then you can take her after you finish what you have to do . " That 's what I should have said . But no , that was n't what I said at all . I 'd merely given in once more . <p> It 's so funny how later on you can always think of stuff you should have said . So my new goal is to learn how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what . I just have a hard time telling someone I ca n't do something when honestly I know that physically I can . Just one more lovely trait I can attribute to my fine upbringing . <p> My mother never believed in telling lies , not even the little white ones folks basically say it 's okay to tell . You know like , " No , you do n't look fat in that . " Or " Cute outfit . " What about , " Oh , no ; I really do like your hair . I was only staring so hard at you because it 's so ... different . " <p> Not my mama . It was " Girl , now you know you 're too old to be trying to wear something like that . " Or " Somebody lied to you . Go back and try again . " Or what about , " That looks good , it just does n't look good on you . " Still , she will do anything for you . <p> I started planning special events as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this could someday become my real bread and butter if I continue to pursue it seriously . Everybody says I 'm great at putting things together . That 's what I was doing yesterday after work-taking care of some pressing business for an upcoming wedding . A wedding , incidentally , that 's huge and could really put my name on the go-to-for-event-planning map . <p> I pushed myself to do what I had to do after work , then managed to take Nae-nae 's mother to the store . It took her two whole hours to shop . Two hours I really did n't have to spare . She insisted on doing it herself . Seriously , she could have given me the list she 'd already written out anyway , and I would have been done in fifteen minutes . Tops . Instead , she ended up riding in the mobile cart the store provided . She 'd stand up , get an item , put it in the basket , sit down , then ride sometimes just to the next group of items , only to begin the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know , maybe I really am as hopeless a case as Cass said . Cass is my ex-boyfriend . His real name is Cassius , named after his father who was named after Cassius Clay the boxer before he changed his name to Muhammad Ali . If you ask me , I 'd say Cass thought his name was short for Casanova . But truthfully , he was the one who got me started on this self-evaluating journey I 've been on lately . Cass flat out said I was too easy and a real pushover . Well , he should know , since he treated me like a disposable pen , then pushed me over and threw me away when he felt my ink was all but used up . <p> And to think he had the nerve to break up with me and make out like everything was all my fault . He claimed I was too self-centered for him . Give me a break ! So I was supposed to believe that I was too easy , a pushover , while at the same time believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the best thing Cass ever did for me was to move his narcissist-self on . Now , you want to talk about somebody being stuck on himself , then that is Cass , the guy I dated last for a whole year , to a T. After Cass , I started listening to my pastor and decided to pray that God would send the right man into my life , own . <p> This was all too much to be thinking about this early in the morning , especially with very little time before the alarm was going to sound . But I still found a way to doze off again . I hit the snooze button three times before finally dragging myself out of the bed . Standing in front of the window , I took in the stillness of the day 's beginnings , then hurried to dress , made my way to work , and got to my desk with two minutes to spare . <p> Marcus Peeples was walking out of Dr. Brewer 's office when I arrived . He often comes into the OB/GYN 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy I 've ever seen ( especially with the glasses he wears ) , Marcus is around 5 ' 11 " and sort of lanky , particularly compared to me . <p> Some label my body type as thick , which means curvy in all the right places . My mother said we 're just big-boned people . " Absolutely nothing to be ashamed of , " Mama always said . It 's never bothered me . After all , Marilyn Monroe was a size fourteen , same as me . <p> Marcus seemed like an all right guy . He was usually trying to push ( what I assumed ) his pharmaceutical products on my boss , who must be too nice to tell him to buzz off . But lately , every time he has come in here with his fancy briefcase in hand , he has tried to strike up more and more conversation with me . <p> Two months ago , he asked if I was married or dating anyone . Having just broken up with Cass a few weeks earlier , my answer pretty much conveyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was n't interested in dating anyone anytime soon . He promptly dropped that line of questioning for a few weeks . Then it happened . Today , in fact . <p> When Marcus walked into Dr. Brewer 's office , he stepped over to my desk and without his customary hi or how are you said , " How about you and I go out on a date . " <p> I flashed him a quick fake , polite smile , and replied , " Thanks , but no thanks . " Who says I ca n't say no and mean it ? <p> He nodded as he smiled back at me . " Oh , I see . You must only be interested in the kind of guys who like to break your heart , then leave you to put the pieces back together , " Marcus said . <p> For someone who reminded me at best of a reformed nerd , at worst of someone almost anyone could take down in a fight , that statement took me totally by surprise . <p> " No . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pointing my finger at him on cue with the word you , not caring whether my words hurt his feelings . I was on a roll today : two no 's in a row . <p> Instead of scurrying away the way I expected he would do , he set his briefcase down on my desk . " And how do you know that ? " <p> My eyes immediately went to the briefcase , then back to him . " A woman knows these things , " I said , rolling my chair back away from him just a tad . He 'd gotten a little too close for my comfort . <p> " Just as I suspected . You 're one of those women who will never give a good man a chance . That way , you can have your beliefs validated about all the men who have hurt you and feel justified without those beliefs ever being challenged . " <p> What did he do that for ? I was just about to say something smart like " Is that right , Dr. Phil ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing how glasses can change a person 's looks entirely . Right before my eyes , in just that instant , Marcus Peeples was transformed from Clark Kent into Superman-I kid you not . I noticed for the first time his hair , cut low and sort of wavy , most likely with the help of a wave cap . I took note of how perfect his hairstyle fit his caramel-colored face . His goatee , which I had n't paid attention to , was perfect for his triangular jaw . But it was those long , thick , black eyelashes framing those gorgeous , twinkling brown eyes that now had me completely fixated and , quite frankly , at a loss for words . Dr. Phil who ? <p> I scooted my chair back a little bit more , smiled , then shook my head to emphasize that his assessment of me and my situation was totally wrong as I tried to right my ship . He 'd gotten me a little off course . <p> He placed his hand on his briefcase . " One date , " Marcus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose ? " He flashed me a big smile . Near-perfect white teeth , and I declare one of them appeared to have twinkled . <p> I maintained my coolness , breathing evenly as I began to speak . " One , huh ? " <p> He held up his index finger . " One . And you can choose the time and the place . If you find we have nothing in common or that you do n't like me , then no harm , no foul . So , what do you say ? " <p> I had to snap out of this , and quick . I had to take back control . " Okay , " I said slowly , not wanting to answer too quickly . " How about tonight ? " <p> " Tonight ? " He sounded as though that had caught him completely off guard . I sensed I was definitely interfering with some already laid plans . <p> Good ! Last-minute dates usually get the ones who are n't really serious every single time . " I 'm sorry . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of true concern and sincerity . " Do you already have something planned for tonight ? Because if you do ... " <p> " I did , but for you , I 'll change it . Tonight works for me . So where would you like to go ? " <p> I could n't help but grin . " How about Bible study , my church ? And we need to be there by seven o'clock . " I crossed my arms . Body language experts would likely say I was putting up a barrier between us . I 'd classify it as expressing my confidence as I had officially regained control . <p> He began to chuckle . " Oh , " he sang the word , " so , you 're one of those kind of women , huh ? " <p> " Those kind ? Is church a problem for you ? " I could tell despite his smile and chuckle that I 'd unnerved him slightly . Double good ! <p> He continued to grin . " No problem . I said you could choose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of my word . " He took out his business card and handed it to me . <p> " I 'm sure Dr. Brewer already has your card on file , " I said . <p> " He does , but this card is for you . " He took out his Black-Berry . " Now , if I could get your home address ? " He looked at me and saw what I imagine had to be a defensive expression on my face . " Miss Melissa Anderson , I need your home address so I can pick you up tonight . That 's what real men do . " A boyish grin broke across his face again . <p> I looked at his card before glancing back at him . He put his glasses on and he was instantly transformed back into the harmless Clark Kent . The information on his card was personable enough . He had his home address and both a home and a cell phone number listed . A home number given-not foolproof by any means but a positive sign-was generally a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a way to sneak around on his wife . I do n't play that other-woman stuff . Got burned once accidentally . I vowed never again if I could help it . <p> Still , I weighed whether or not I should give him my home address at this point . After all , there are plenty of crazies running around in this world . On the other hand , I did sort of know him , so he was n't a total stranger . He 'd been in here at least ten times that I know of-sometimes when patients were here , most times before office hours began . He seemed a decent enough guy . <p> I rattled off my home address as he keyed it into his BlackBerry . <p> All right now , Mr. Marcus Peeples . Let 's just see how much you like Bible study at Followers of Jesus Faith Worship Center as a first date . I already sensed , based on the way he had reacted when I mentioned the word " church " that this was going to be fun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Uz , whose name was Job ; and that man was perfect and upright , and one that feared God , and eschewed evil . - Job 1:1 <p> Any woman who will be truly honest knows at least one good man who 's gotten a bad rap about something . And this is coming from a woman who has met some real jerks in her day . <p> Like my friend Nae-nae , I started developing pretty early in life . My grandma said it was due to all those fast-food meals we ate all the time instead of home-cooked ones like she cooked for her children back in the day . <p> " When you grow chicken legs and wings the size of a turkey in that short amount of time , you know there 's something unnatural , " Grandma would say . " If you grow food on steroids and you feed it to your body , what other results do you expect to get ? Back in my day , we used to say , You are what you eat . ' Well , the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you young folk are n't careful and do n't stop eating so much junk . " <p> My mother never paid much attention to what her mother had to say , at least not on that subject . " Mama , fast food is called fast food for a reason , " she 'd say . <p> My brother Diddy-bo , who is two years older than me , and I would sit quietly and listen to Grandma and Mama as they argued about stuff like that . I believe that 's why Mama worked so hard to help get Grandma married off and out of her house . <p> Diddy-bo and I would find ourselves confused about the two of them , mostly our mother . When we were in church singing , " Give me that old-time religion , " Mama would always sing the part about it being good enough for her mother therefore it was good enough for her . Diddy-bo brought that to Mama 's attention after a church service once when Mama and Grandma were going at it big time about something they did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus when she sang about it being good enough for her mother , and not Church 's Chicken versus chitterlings or collard greens cooked with hog jowls or fatback . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
