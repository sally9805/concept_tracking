Jamey promised to lend me a copy of Nausea . He had borrowed the book from Mr. Loden , the only English teacher at our school who was n't a nun . Mr. Loden was a Quaker , and he liked to loan us books that were n't in the school library . He owned seven copies of Catcher in the Rye . At one time he owned eight , but he had loaned one to my sister Edna . Then my father found it and tore it into pieces . Luckily he never knew who it belonged to . None of us would say a word . You 'd have thought the book grew up on its own , like a fungus , in the comer of the living room . <p> I first saw the Nausea book when Jamey and I were at a school basketball game . We both hated basketball , but this was the city-wide final , and attendance was compulsory . They held it one afternoon in the school gym . Jamey sat on the topmost bleacher , ignoring the cheerleaders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt folded carefully to cover my knees . I had a good view of the book 's cover  --  a pale man with black hair , naked from the waist up , scratching himself , a look of disgust on his face . I wondered if the man was Jean-Paul Sartre . <p> The game went on and on , and we never cheered . One of the cheerleaders  --  a big blond girl , whose chest and thighs shook when she jumped  --  kept looking up at us , anger and horror mingled in her face . I had been thinking that Jamey and I were a good-looking pair  --  both of us lightly built , with pale skin and dark hair and big dark eyes . But from the way this cheerleader looked at us , you might have thought that we were gargoyles , or the Antichrist himself , sitting in the upper bleachers of Assumption High . <p> When the game ended , we ran down the bleachers and walked home . As we walked Jamey told me about Nausea . " It 's existentialism , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Jamey smiled . " Somebody once asked Sartre to define existentialism . Sartre pointed to an empty blackboard . ' That 's existentialism , ' he said . <p> " You ca n't define it , " Jamey went on . " It just is . " <p> I could think of nothing more to say . We crossed the street . Jamey 's younger brother Tim was standing around with five or six other boys , smoking cigarettes in front of Ryan 's grocery . They met there every day , to smoke and talk . <p> " Hey , Jamey , you seen Clancy ? " Tim shouted . <p> " No , " Jamey said . <p> " Was he in Latin today ? " <p> " Probably , " Jamey said . We kept walking . I thought about all the afternoons I had seen Jamey standing there with the other boys as I walked home from school . I had never thought , then , that he and I would become friends . <p> Friends was the word I used for it . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered if Jamey ever missed those long afternoons of smoking and fighting and talking  --  but then I thought of one afternoon when my friend Mary Beth and I had been standing inside the grocery , selling tickets for a church raffle and listening to the conversation of the boys outside . They were talking about knees . Girls ' knees . <p> John Clancy said that you could tell a Protestant girl from a Catholic girl by the shape of her knees . Protestant knees were round and sometimes " lopsided , " he said , while Catholic knees were " lovely and square . " " It 's all the kneeling in the church that makes them square , " he said . <p> Mary Beth and I had exchanged glances . <p> Pat Muldoon challenged Clancy 's theory . " What about scrubwomen ? " he said . " They spend half their life kneeling , but I 've never seen one with your lovely square knees . They 're all bumpy , sort of . " <p> Clancy said that scrubwomen kneel on a different part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrubbed , he said . Whereas Catholic girls knelt in an upright position , which distributed their weight evenly across their kneecaps . <p> Mary Beth and I laughed about it later , but at the time we were stealing looks at each other 's knees . <p> I decided now that Jamey must have outgrown that sort of conversation . <p> " How do you live , if you believe in existentialism ? " I asked him . <p> " You do n't believe in it , exactly , " Jamey said . " It 's more like all of a sudden you 're different . You see things differently , you act differently . " He pushed back his hair from his forehead . <p> " Like , Sartre is in a cafe and he sees a glass of beer , " he went on . " Perfectly normal glass of beer , nothing odd about it . Except that suddenly he sees it , like for the first time . He ca n't take it for granted , the way other people do . It 's out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what to make of that . " A man scared of a glass of beer ? " I said . It reminded me of something my mother said : " The French make everything into a problem . " Of course , she was thinking of the Delacroix family over on Water Street . <p> " Wait . " Jamey stopped walking . He pulled the book from his jacket pocket , and began to flip through its pages . When he found what he wanted , he read it aloud to me . <p> It was exactly as he had described it . A man scared sick by a glass of beer . But there was a bit at the end that made sense to me . " Read that part again , " I said . <p> He read : " ' I am alone in the midst of these happy reasonable voices . All these creatures spend their time explaining , realizing happily that they agree with each other . In Heaven 's name , why is it so important to think the same things all together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . <p> Jamey looked up from the book . His face was serious , his hair was in his eyes . I thought for a second that he might try to kiss me right there in the middle of Butler Avenue . <p> But I looked away and shifted the books in my arms . We walked on . <p> After a while , I asked , " What kind of teacher is Loden ? " <p> " He 's all right , " Jamey said . He looked over at me . " All the girls seem to think they 're in love with him . " <p> " Really ? " Of course I already knew that , thanks to my sister Edna . Mr. Loden had long brown hair  --  long enough to touch his shirt collar  --  and he wore gold-rimmed glasses and tweedy suits . I had passed him in the hallway many times , and after he went by , I could still smell his after-shave . Mr. Loden was the only person in the school who smelled like that . Edna said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a cut above the Jade East and Brut that some of the seniors wore . <p> Jamey was still looking at me . " I 'm not in love With him , " I said . <p> " I did n't think you were , " he said . <p> We reached my house and stood for a moment on the front porch . " Let me borrow that book when you 're through , " I said . <p> " Sure , " he said . He was watching me intently . I liked the way he looked , standing there in the shade of the porch , his hair falling into his eyes as usual , and I liked the way he was interested in me . He never took girls for granted , he seemed to think them mysterious . And he seemed to find me more mysterious than anyone . I assumed it was because he did n't have any sisters . <p> " See you later , " I said , and went through the front door . <p> " Hey , Kathleen ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to you later , " he said . <p> I smiled and shut the door . Cryptic , be cryptic , I told myself . Keep him guessing . Inside , I set my books on the stairs . The house smelled like corned beef . I held my breath as I walked toward the kitchen . <p> My mother was paring potatoes at the sink . She said I could do the carrots . Then she asked about school . The smell of corned beef was everywhere . I did n't want to talk much . I did n't want to open my mouth and let the smell of corned beef get inside . <p> " What about those tests ? " my mother asked . She took a peeler from the kitchen drawer and handed it to me . <p> " Tests ? " I said , thinking of the corned beef . " Tests ? " <p> " Those tests you were telling me about , " she said . " L.Q. tests . " <p> " I.Q. , " I said , picking up a carrot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sister says they 'll have the results next week . " <p> " And ? " <p> " And the guidance counselor will call each of us in , " I said . " But she wo n't tell us the number , the actual I.Q. Sister said she 'll tell us we did poorly , or average , or good , or very good , or excellent . She said two years ago they had someone who was very excellent . Someone like Einstein , I guess . " <p> My mother thought for a minute . " It might have been the eldest Clancy boy . " <p> " Roger Clancy ? " I was skeptical . I remembered him as a fat boy with pimples . Now he was studying to be a priest . <p> " He had a photographic memory , everyone said . " My mother did n't understand these things , but I was n't about to correct her . " These numbers , " she went on , " these I.Q. 's , what do they mean ? " <p> " Sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " They measure your ability to think in certain kinds of ways . " <p> " But they use them to award the scholarships ? " <p> " I 'm not sure , " I said . " Sister said that I.Q. is very important . But she did n't say exactly why . " <p> I finished paring the last carrot and went to put the peelings into the garbage can . Then I came back to the table to cut the carrots . My father liked them cut lengthwise , then in chunks . The home economics teacher at school said it was more nutritious to cut them only in chunks , leaving the cores intact . I had told my father this , and he said , " Baloney . " <p> " This way all the vitamins escape into the water , " I said to myself , as I cut the things lengthwise . <p> " What ? " my mother asked . <p> " Nothing . How was your day ? " <p> " Well . Bridget was a fussy one , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's home , and he 's into the scotch whiskey , " she said . <p> My mother kept on peeling potatoes , but her mouth twitched . <p> " And he 's tired tonight , " Edna said . " He 's painting that house at the corner of Leicester Avenue , that high red one , so he 's bound to be fired . " <p> " Well , stay out of his way , " my mother said . She looked worried , but she almost always looked worried . Her mouth turned down , and her eyes had a vague look to them . Edna said our mother had a rough childhood . Her parents were dead , and she never talked about them . <p> I put the pan of carrots on the stove . " What are your plans for tonight ? " my mother asked Edna . I left the kitchen . <p> The upstairs bathroom reeked of mineral spirits . He used the stuff to clean his hands . Slime clung to the bathroom sink , with flecks of red paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I whispered , cleaning most of it away with toilet paper . <p> Supper started badly . Bridget grabbed a potato from the dish , then shrieked and dropped it . My father shouted at her . <p> " The potato was hot , " my mother protested . <p> " That child will not throw good food on the floor , " my father said , ignoring my mother . " She will learn that I wo n't tolerate it . " <p> The rest of us ate rapidly . We waited for him to finish , but my father was n't very hungry that night . He left a large piece of meat on his plate . " Too much fat , " he said . <p> " Usually he likes the fat , " I heard Edna say as she and Michael went to scrape plates in the kitchen . <p> I went upstairs to do homework . I felt a little guilty , leaving my mother and Bridget alone with him . <p> It was turning dark , and the sky was streaked with red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I used as a desk . I did all of the math , then the science . When I began the English I turned on the radio . The top-forty station was playing requests . I stopped writing to listen between the songs , in case anyone dedicated a song to Kathleen . <p> Soon after nine , the telephone rang . The noise was faint , muffled by the rooms below me . But I heard it , and stopped writing . My brother , Michael , came to the foot of the stairs and shouted , " Kathleen ! " I jumped from the chair and ran down . <p> It was Jamey . He said he could n't talk long because he was going to help his father work on their car . <p> " Did you do your homework ? " I asked . <p> " No . " <p> " I 'm still doing mine , " I said . <p> " I 've been reading Nausea , " Jamey said . " Also I went to see Clancy . We 're going to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " An electric bass . A Gibson . I 'll take you to see it if you 'd like to . " <p> " I would like to , " I said . " I did n't know that you played guitar . " <p> " I do n't yet , " he said . <p> We seemed to have run out of things to say . <p> After a while , Jamey said , " How was your day ? " <p> I tried to think of something I had n't told him earlier . " We did n't have history , " I said . " We had a movie instead . " <p> " Any good ? " <p> " No . It was about modern industry . It had cartoon characters in a factory . Like , Donald Duck makes steel . Daisy Duck worked in the cafeteria , and gave him a hard time . Larry Baker got sent to the office for mocking it . " <p> " They make those movies for little rich kids who do n't have a foundry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably . Mr. Logan came into study hall later and told us that he thought it was a dumb movie , too . " <p> Jamey was silent . <p> I pretended to kiss the receiver , making no sound . " Tell me more about existentialism , " I said . <p> " Hold on , " he said . " I 'll get the book . " <p> I heard laughter coming from the television set in the living room . But no one was laughing in our house . Probably a rerun , I thought . <p> " Okay . " Jamey came back on the line . " Okay , listen : ' Nothing happens while you live . The scenery changes , people come in and go out , that 's all . There are no beginnings . Days are tacked on to days without rhyme or reason , an interminable , monotonous addition . ' " <p> I disagreed . But I kept quiet . I listened . <p> " ' There are moments  --  rarely  --  when you make a landmark , you realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messy business . The time of a flash . After that , the procession starts again . ' " <p> His voice was a monotone . I tuned it out , briefly , then began to listen again . " ' But everything changes when you tell about life ; it 's a change no one notices : the proof is that people talk about true stories . As if there could possibly be true stories ; things happen one way and we tell about them in the opposite sense . ' " <p> I was about to comment on this when a voice said , " Will you look at that . " My father had come up behind me . " I thought that you were upstairs , doing your homework . " He stood in the hallway , his hand on the wall . I could smell the whiskey . <p> I put my hand over the telephone 's mouthpiece . " Daddy , I was . I 've only been talking for a few minutes . " <p> " Give me that , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , you , " he said into the telephone . " Kathleen has better things to do than waste time listening to your nonsense . Do you hear me ? You children have schoolwork to do . " He hung up the receiver . <p> I stared at him . " You had no right to do that . " <p> " No right ? In my own home ? " He kept his eyes on the telephone . " It 's you that has no right , as long as you 're living under my roof . Now you remember that . " <p> He brushed past me , headed for the kitchen . Then he turned back . " Get yourself upstairs and finish your homework . Your mother keeps telling me you 're a smart girl . Do n't you be silly and throw that away . Talking to boys at night at your age . " He shook his head . He would become maudlin next , I thought . <p> I shook my head back at him . " I hate you , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hates me . " He grinned , and turned back toward the kitchen . " Go on now , " he said over his shoulder . " Upstairs with you . " <p> I did n't move . " Coward , " I said . <p> He stopped walking . <p> " You do n't face up to yourself , " ! said . " Instead you bully us . " <p> He whirled around and took three quick steps toward me , raising his hand . I ducked to the right , to spare my face . <p> But he did n't hit me . When I looked up , he was on his way to the kitchen again . He slammed shut the door behind him , and I heard his voice bellowing for my mother . <p> I ran up the stairs and into my room . I sat at my desk , vowing that I would n't cry . Crying , I knew , was what he wanted . I pulled a piece of paper from my notebook and drew a line on it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downturns . I labeled some of them : " Bridget born , " and " Began seventh grade , " and " Met Jamey . " Then I made the line turn upward and climb steeply , without fluctuating . I labeled the turning point : " Eighteenth birthday  --  left home . " <p> I left the paper on my desk , but I kept looking at it as I got ready for bed . <p> After I switched out the light , my mind turned over and over again . Eventually it settled to thinking about my father . For some reason I thought of the night three years before , when President John Kennedy died . We watched the television all evening , and later , when I was unable to sleep , ! went downstairs again . My parents were still sitting on the couch . The room was dark but for the television 's blue flicker . My father was lying in my mother 's arms and he was weeping . I never saw him cry before or since . He was saying , " ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At the time , the words had moved me . But now they made me feel nothing . The scene was unfamiliar , unlikely , as if I 'd dreamed it . I tried to sleep . But the image remained in my head like a photograph . <p> Long after midnight , I heard the foundry whistle signal the changing shifts . Later ! heard the train , gathering speed as it pulled away from the city . I lay in bed with my eyes open until the room began to grow light again . I heard my mother walk downstairs to make coffee and my father cough as he ran water in the bathroom . I listened without any anger to the noises they made . I could n't find it in me to hate them . <p> When it was time for me to get up , my body felt stiff and cold . I pushed my arms into the shirt that was part of the school uniform . As I buttoned it , I caught sight of the paper on my desk , with the map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly , to me now . I tore the paper into bits . Then , to amuse myself , I pulled up my bedroom storm window a few inches and pushed the pieces through the gap . They fell as lightly as dust or dandelion fluff . A moment later I saw my father walk over them , as he left the house to go to work again . <p> <p> By Susan Hubbard <p> Susan Hubbard is the author of Walking on Ice ( University of Missouri Press ) , a collection of stories that received the Associated Writing Programs ' Short Fiction Prize .
