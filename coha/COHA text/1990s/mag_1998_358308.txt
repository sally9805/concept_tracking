The Olympics , to invoke a perhaps too-available and all-encompassing analogy , are much like the Titanic , both the movie and the ship . In other words , it 's a grand , old-fashioned blockbuster that stirs you in some primal , half-forgotten place , however vigilant your defenses , throwing up simple human images of panic and delight and loss ; and a huge , showy , zillion-dollar model of the family of man that , for all its state-of-the-art grandeur and planning , can not outswerve a block of ice . It should n't work , but it does ; things should work , but they do n't . As the surprise U.S. silver medalist in the doubles luge , Chris Thorpe , said of his surprise bronze-medalist teammates , " They do n't have great lines , they do n't have great form . They just fly . " <P> If medals were awarded for staging an Olympics , Nagano would doubtless receive a silver , the color of its snowfall ; almost everything Japanese was delicate and accommodating except the weather , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same to schedules . In the end , however , true grit prevailed : the fastest man on skis , Hermann Maier ( " Other Name : Das Monster , " his official bio explains ) , confirmed his extraterrestrial status by getting up from a horrific crash and picking up two golds in four days ; his female counterpart , Katja Seizinger , returned to form by winning two golds in two days . Even little Denmark claimed its first Winter medal ever , in curling  --  quite a feat for a nation that does n't have a functioning curling rink . For Japan , the Games were a happy windfall , as the host nation rode on the cheers of its faithful fans to win more golds in 16 days than it had won in 70 years of Winter Games . Ski jumper Kazuyoshi Funaki assured himself of heartthrob status by flying away with three medals ; more movingly , Masahiko Harada , who had let glory slip away in his final jump in two consecutive Olympics , somehow pulled off the longest jumps in Olympic history in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran through the crowd , larger than in all the other arenas combined , and the grand swelling of emotion in a people not usually demonstrative touched even foreign hearts . <P> Americans were presumably less happy with the proceedings . The millionaire-filled hockey " Dream Team " won just one of its four games , and , pining perhaps for the days of being an amateur underdog , trashed parts of the Olympic Village before departing . A sparkly Tara Lipinski ( " Occupation : pupil " ) and an obviously disappointed Michelle Kwan ( " Hobby : corresponding with pen pals " ) claimed gold and silver , but Nicole Bobek , who 'd hoped to join them on the medal stand , ended up a disappointing 17th . It generally fell to women to lift America 's spirits : Nikki Stone , told she could never ski again after a back injury two years ago , claiming a gold in freestyle aerials ; or Chris Witty , daughter of Walter Witty ( just one letter from a daydream ) , winning a bronze and a silver in speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
