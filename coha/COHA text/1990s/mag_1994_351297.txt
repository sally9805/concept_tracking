" We are Boer people ! We are fighters ! " thundered Eugene Terreblanche , leader of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement ( A.W.B. ) , the bastion of white supremacists unwilling to accept South Africa 's changing destiny . " I think there will be more explosions and more actions if the government ignores the just claim of my people who demand some land . " The fiery rhetoric inspired some of the 300 khaki-clad men and pistol-packing women to rough up and then oust a black American reporter attending the otherwise desultory rally . The motive behind all the violence : a whites-only homeland . <P> The election-eve bombings are more likely to signal the last gasp of a weak , splintered racist Afrikaner minority than the start of the long-threatened great Boer revolt . Three of the 32 arrested are close to Terreblanche , including leaders of his personal bodyguard unit , the elite Iron Guard . The long , resolute march of democracy has caused deepening divisions within the white right . " The bombing campaign , " says Wim Booyse , a political consultant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heart of the right wing . " <P> The fortunes of apartheid-forever whites have been declining steadily since the all-white referendum on reform in 1992 , when moderates gave President F.W. de Klerk 's National Party a landslide victory over the diehards led by the Conservative Party . Since then the number of active right-wing organizations has declined from 186 to 20 . <P> Although the A.W.B. , the most militant of the groups , claims 65,000 members , analysts say there are no more than 15,000 , fewer than 5,000 of whom are violent activists . Most members are working-class or poor whites struggling as crop farmers and factory workers to make ends meet  --  the Afrikaners who feel most threatened by black equality in the workplace . <P> The election drove a wedge between Terreblanche and his political ally , Afrikaner Volksfront leader Ferdinand Hartzenberg , and the supporters of former South African Defense Force chief Constand Viljoen . All three men want an Afrikaner state , or volkstaat , but Terreblanche and Hartzenberg believe it can be achieved only by the gun . Viljoen thinks he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country . In March he formed the Freedom Front Party and registered to participate in the elections . If he wins support , as expected , from more than half the estimated 1 million conservative white voters , it will prove that a majority support peaceful rather than violent moves to win their political and cultural goals . <P> Viljoen was wooed away from the hard-liners with a promise from the African National Congress that a volkstaat council would be set up in the new government to explore the possibility of an Afrikaner homeland . The A.N.C . has largely defused the right-wing threat , placating many frightened whites by accepting a mandatory government of national unity for five years and guaranteeing jobs and pensions for more than 200,000 civil servants , policemen and soldiers .
