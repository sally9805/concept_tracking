Will the Serbian conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina end with a bang or a whimper  --  the crash of bombs or the fade-out of NATO 's threat to attack ? The answer depends on a dozen conflicting motives , but most of all on the Serbs . Once again the confident Bosnian Serbs are playing the U.N . and NATO like stringed instruments . The Bosnian Serb leader , Radovan Karadzic , and his military commander , Ratko Mladic , last week eased the strangulation of Sarajevo a notch , calculating how much would be just enough to make the U.S. and its allies hold fire . <P> The cross fire of threats , bluffs and assurances over the former Yugoslavia is confusing  --  often intentionally so  --  but the Serbs have obviously figured it out . They have concluded they are safe from air attack if they do not fire too many artillery shells into Sarajevo , if they allow a few small convoys of humanitarian aid to enter the city and if they pull back a bit from the mountaintops they recently captured to complete their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements last week when they moved behind agreed withdrawal lines Saturday and allowed U.N . peacekeepers to patrol the area . It worked . NATO strike planes did not take off . <P> Even so , the war talk went on . Secretary of State Warren Christopher , reversing his July judgment that the U.S. was doing all it could , declared flatly , " It is in our national interest to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo . " In Brussels , the NATO allies worked out a list of Serbian military targets and completed arrangements on which air units would go into action and how the chain of command would operate . The allied air forces were waiting only for the order to go . <P> On the heights of Mount Igman and Mount Bjelasnica overlooking the city , Serb militiamen appeared to take heed . Making a show of fulfilling Karadzic 's original promise to pull back , troops began to move off the mountainsides , accompanied by tanks , trucks and jeeps . As they left , they apparently set fire to several ski lodges . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grimy soldiers lined up for tourist buses that would carry them away from the peaks they had captured after 10 days of heavy fighting . Some displayed the souvenirs of victory : a Bosnian flag , a helmet with an inscription in Arabic script , street signs from occupied towns . " We follow orders , " said one soldier , " but men should not die for this if we are only going to give it back . " <P> Whether they were actually giving it back was far from certain . These troops were from Banja Luka in the north , and as they moved out they were being replaced by fresh , local soldiers . Were they afraid of NATO air attacks if they did not withdraw ? No , replied a self-confident Serb captain . " We know you can hurt us by air strikes , but you can only defeat us on the ground , " he said . " You will not send your boys here to die on my soil . " <P> NATO might not even send airplanes . When the alliance finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that at least one more meeting would be needed before any strikes . And those it might order would be " limited to the support of humanitarian relief . " The real test , said Christopher , was whether the Serbs would " let conditions improve within that city , so the city is not under the constant threat of being strangled . "
