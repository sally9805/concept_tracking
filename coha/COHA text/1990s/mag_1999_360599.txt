Before embarking on his acclaimed cycle of plays on black life in the 20th century ( Ma Rainey 's Black Bottom , The Piano Lesson ) , Wilson penned this early work about the denizens of a gypsy-cab company in Pittsburgh , Pa. , in the late 1970s . Now , given a " definitive " rewrite by the author , it has been revived in a superlative production at the Center Stage , in Baltimore , Md . With little obvious effort , Wilson rivets our attention on the daily struggles of a half-dozen ordinary but entirely individual characters while gradually homing in on the explosive conflict between two : the cab company 's owner and his estranged son , just released from prison after 20 years . Unusual for a Wilson play , Jitney loses some momentum in the second act ; but it 's still a major work by a major artist . <P>  --  By Richard Zoglin
