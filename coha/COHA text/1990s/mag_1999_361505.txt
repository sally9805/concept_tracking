The show of early works on paper by the German artist Sigmar Polke , which runs through June 16 at New York City 's Museum of Modern Art , is a bit of an anticlimax . Much has been expected of Polke . He is one of the two painters  --  the other being Anselm Kiefer  --  who rose to the top of the enormously promoted pack of " new " German artists in the 1980s and remained there when others dropped away or became , like Georg Baselitz , with his crude upside-down figures , formulaic bores . <P> The contrast between Kiefer and Polke could n't be sharper , of course . Kiefer ( whose drawings were recently shown at New York City 's Metropolitan Museum of Art ) is oratorical , Wagnerian ; he is a flat-out mythomane , dedicated to the Sublime , the Enormous and the Ultra-German ; a marvelous artist at his best and at his worst a Black Forest ham . Polke is thinner , weirder and more elusive . His work  --  whose basic nature developed during the period covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard-to-read image haze formed by the overlay of Pop art on Germany 's postwar consumer society and its emblems , refracted through a needling , ironic and sweetly anarchic temperament . <P> Polke depends not just heavily but entirely on the " appropriation " of visuals from all manner of sources , from comic books to ads , from news photos to William Blake . He skips and flitters like a frenetic troll through this forest of images without feeling the least impulse to make narrative sense . His work has the rambling , no-rules character of a dopehead 's monologue . Indeed , just as Filippo Marinetti , leader of the Italian Futurists 90 years ago , called himself " the caffeine of Europe , " so one of Polke 's doodles , of a glass tube with powder spilling from it , is titled Polke as a Drug , 1968 . <P> How high you get on him depends on your cultural expectations . Polke has influenced a slew of younger American painters , and been hailed as the man who set painting in the ' 80s free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  by reviving , once more , the spirit of Dada that breathed through such movements as the Fluxus group in the ' 60s . He 's the arch-trickster , mocking all art styles , sending up the dreaded Canon . ( The fact that no work of art by a famous artist these days can safely be considered really and truly outside the Canon seems not to have dawned on those inside the Museum of Modern Art . ) His strategy , according to MOMA , is to subvert " the elitist mythologies of artistic creation and production . " And so forth . Such claims are counters in a solemn Laputan game whose object is to ratify the countercultural status of a given artist and thereby justify his ( or her ) prompt entry into the cultural pantheon . <P> There are times when you feel that if you hear the words elitist or subvert just once more , you 'll barf . So when MOMA 's Margit Rowell , who in the past has curated some intelligent shows on Constructivist sculpture , Brancusi , Antonin Artaud 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has " regenerated the language and meaning of Western artistic experience , " and suggests that he is the Hieronymus Bosch of our day , you sigh . Polke has never shown a smidgen of the aesthetic intensity , the absorption in religious and moral experience or the staggering completeness of Bosch 's universe of images . This has to be the silliest comparison since Julian Schnabel last likened himself to Picasso .
