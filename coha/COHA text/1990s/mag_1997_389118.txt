At the age of 28 , he 's got a Grammy on his mantel , a sitcom in syndication , another boxoffice smash on the way and a Headnote leading lady by his side // WHEN I FIRST MET RUSSELL SIMMONS , he was like , What kind of nigga are you ? " Will Smith is remembering a day from his 16-year-old life . Back then Simmons was a flashier , less polished version of the Def Jam , Phat Farm , Nutty Professor hip-hop mogul-impresario he is today . Will Smith , fondly known around Philly as The Fresh Prince , was then at the apex of the first of his several incarnations-hip-hop superstar . His classic debut album , Rock the House , featured the smash " Girls Ai n't Nothing but Trouble , " and his " raised right " style of rap was rocking high-school gyms . Even as a rapper Smith had mass appeal . His second album , He 's the DJ , I 'm the Rapper , won him the first Best Rap Performance Grammy for his 1988 megahit " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cute , and brothas sensed real integrity . His DJ Jazzy Jeff got street props for inventing a trick cut called " the transformer , " while Will was at the other end of the stage reassuring parents that yes , some of us were raised right and had n't lost our senses . His TV show , The Fresh Prince of Bel Air , which appeared in 1990 , was a hip-hop first , an early experiment in the marketability of young Black folks . Smith did n't embarrass us . He was consistently witty , smart and , perhaps most important , hilarious without ever playing the fool . When his hit show crossed over into White households , it opened the door for recording artists-turned-sitcom stars Queen Latifah , LL Cool J and Brandy . Now at 28 , Will Smith is well into his third career , and as with music and the small screen , he 's poised to make movie history . The megasuccessful Bad Boys and billion-dollar blockbuster Independence Day have positioned him as a real power player in Hollywood . Will 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though his character was written as a minor supporting role . " Bill Pullman had to really pull all the weight , " Will says , then adds , " I was n't trying to kick down any walls . I just wanted to do work . " It 's a sentiment too many of our bankable Black stars are echoing . But with Smith it 's hard not to be charmed . When his mentor Quincy Jones produced last year 's Academy Awards ceremony and leader Jesse Jackson organized a forceful if opportunistic boycott of the show , Will was front and center at the awards , wearing a tux and a smile . " Hey , Jesse 's gon na have to give a brotha some warning next time he wants to throw a boycott . I had my tux ready , " he jokes . Photograph // With his next sure box-office gold , the science-fiction adventure comedy Men in Black , hitting the multiplexes , Smith is reading scripts for the same larger-than-life productions as Tom Cruise . He has also found time to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his film , TV and music production company . ( His roster of artists includes singer-actresses Tatyana Ali and Tichina Arnold . ) Off-camera , he 's a sensitive serial monogamist with a sugary disposition . He 's a brotha who screened Waiting to Exhale and saw no semblance of himself ( " I do n't know why that movie bothered men . I loved everything about it . " ) . It seems that Russell Simmons 's original question still applies : What type of nigga is Will Smith ? And how is he able to be-seemingly without effort-all things to all people , while still remaining doggedly true to himself ? What 's more-how to explain his remarkable golf swing ? " Did you see that ? " Will Smith shouts to his younger brother , Harry . " Two-forty yards in this wind ! " Will and Harry are on the green . Not just any green , mind you ; this is a country club , an expensive , sprawling , breathtakingly beautiful course , designed by golf legend Jack Nicklaus . Smith clearly has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only Black faces here today , This does n't seem to occur to Smith , who has the diplomatic carriage of someone who owns the place . " I played with Tiger Woods a couple of weeks ago , " he says . " He had me on my toes . " Will plants his spiked Nikes in the grass , and his Big Bertha driver sends the tiny ball sailing toward the mountains . " Golf is the ultimate sport , " he declares . " It 's the perfect blend of physical ability and mental prowess . " ( And you thought it was about those fun little carts and acres of manicured lawn . ) Harry 's new to the game , so Will is part competitive older brother , part encouraging coach . When a hailstorm kicks up , they make a dash for Smith 's hunter-green Benz . There , Will dials his " baby . " The cellular is on speaker ; a male voice answers . Seconds later , a sweet voice says , " Hi , baby . " Will grabs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way to the home he and Jada Pinkett share . Jada and Will 's sprawling love nest is nicknamed La Hacienda-the lawn is crowned with a sign that tells you so . Workers are busy on the ranch-style property ; one half of the house is being remodeled to Will and Jada 's specifications . The floors are a rich cobblestone , and the high open roof in the front hallway lends an airy , peaceful feeling . Jada comes to the door dressed in navy sweats and bright orange flip-flops . She goes up on tiptoe and wraps her arms around Will 's neck . Jada 's younger brother is visiting from Baltimore ; his eyes stay glued to the television screen , his hand locked on the Sega controls . Will , just home from destroying his own younger brother on the green , offers to beat Jada 's brother at basketball . Smith 's romantic life has always been pretty public . His first love dumped him for a well-known R &B; artist . We know this because he sat on the fabled Arsenio Hall couch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pretty new wife , Sheree , were one of Ebony 's " 10 Hottest Couples , " and the two of them were seen embracing at premieres . A couple of years later , after the birth of their son , Trey , they divorced . Their divorce settlement , which weighed heavily in Sheree 's favor , was detailed in the media . When asked if the settlement made him bitter , Smith does n't flinch . " Have you read The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran ? " he asks . " Well , he talks about money and things never belonging to anyone , that they just come and go and come again . That 's how I see it . It will come to me again . " Asked if he has paced himself , taken time to heal after each relationship , Will becomes thoughtful . " It might look like I rushed , but I do n't start relationships with people quickly . I take a long time to get to know someone . I 'm always honest ; we can hang out , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll take a two-to-threemonth period to figure out what went wrong and what I can do next time to avoid those same mistakes . I really believe that a man and a woman together , raising a family , is the purest form of happiness we can experience . " Smith 's parents divorced when he was 14 , after they had four children , but for Will the disruption was bearable . " My dad did n't live that far away . We 'd see him all the time . " But for Trey , who wo n't remember what it 's like to have Daddy there when he wakes , the divorce has been harder . " Trey has a mommy and he has a daddy and there are two separate houses and that 's just what his life is ... " Will searches for words to describe the fragile family situation . " It is n't the optimum situation , but that 's his reality . " Though Will had the best intentions when he made Sheree his wife , their failed marriage made him take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped to do in the future . " I guess I 'd never failed at anything , and I could n't accept the failure part , " he admits . " We were both really young . Neither of us really knew what we were getting into . It was so much to deal with . But the most destructive factor was the timing of Six Degrees of Separation . " Six Degrees was groundbreaking work for Will . He won the role of a gay hustler in the film version of the hit Broadway play and was cast opposite seasoned veterans Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channing . The part was a brave departure from his homeboy antics on The Fresh Prince , and it forced Hollywood to consider him an actor with range and depth . But , says Will , " I did n't know that when you work on a role that hard it gets inside of you , that it makes you crazy , puts you in a different place . When I was doing the character , I became him for a little while . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would shop-just be him . Sheree and I were newlyweds , and I was basically crazy . " Given the coupling that 's been going on in Hollywood since the first director yelled " Action ! " it was almost inevitable that Will would find himself in a relationship with a Hollywood actor who could match his star power . Will insists it 's the only way : " Actors hook up out of necessity . The beauty of my life with Jada is that what happened with my first marriage would n't make Jada panic . She understands that place . It takes a really special understanding . Jada being an actress , and just being so completely brilliant , she understands fame , she understands fans , having money , not having money , a successful creative endeavor versus an unsuccessful creative endeavor and how that affects you psychologically and emotionally . She understands what I do . " When he and Jada first met , the first thing Will appreciated was n't , those liquid hazel eyes but the vision and wits behind them . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was exciting and new for me to have questions I felt only she could answer . " Increasingly he began to rely on her calls ; she became a part of his healing process . " I found myself disappointed when I could n't talk to her , when it was late or she was working . " He soon realized he was in love again . This time he truly believes it will last forever . Probably the most frequent question Smith 's friends and family pose ( after " How 's your golf swing coming ? " ) is what the date , time and place of the wedding will be . It 's that obvious , once you 've seen them together , that they are indeed life partners . But Will 's careful about not rushing things this time . " You have to marry your best friend , " he reflects . " Jada Pinkett is my best friend . Not my best female friend . She 's my best friend , period . And that 's the only way a relationship can work . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movies with , not because you 're gon na have sex with her afterward , but because there 's not another person on the planet you 'd rather be with . " Will and Jada recently put their tolerance for each other to the test . For an entire week , 18 hours a day , they locked themselves in a Palm Springs hotel room and banged out a screenplay for a romantic comedy . " You really have to love somebody to do that , " Smith says . " We really enjoyed it . We figured we 're gon na be together anyway , so we might as well work on something . " Of course , while Will and Jada were pouring their hearts into their screenplay , their contemporaries-say , Brad and Gwyneth-were sitting back , reading what their agents sent them . The onus on Black entertainers to be all things-actor , producer , screenwriter-may not be fair , but in Hollywood it 's necessary . " It 's rare that I get a screenplay by a Black writer , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers and directors to tell our stories . We ca n't complain , we 've got to just do it . " That kind of thinking led Smith back into the recording studio , where it all started for him . " I loved Biggie , " Will says of the slain gangster rapper . " But my son does n't have any alternatives to hat kind of sound . " For Will , who sin " andedly created a space for " fun " rap , that kind of balance is imperative to the genre 's survival . " It 's easy to grab your dick and curse and just spew out misogynist rhetoric , " he explains . " Doing what we were doing-speaking proper English on a rap record , rhyming about being punched in the eye and taking it , not pulling out some giant gun-that 's the hard part . " Hence , a slightly different spin on Simmons 's question : Where would we be without a brotha like Will , able to articulate what it is to be young , Black , ambitious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank God we no longer have to worry about the answer to that question . Better to ask : Where will Will Smith succeed next ? Author Affiliation dream hampton , editor-in-chief of Rap Pages , is also working on her golf swing and screenplays. // <p>
