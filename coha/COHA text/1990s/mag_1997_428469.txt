Section : Technology Innovation Where does technological innovation come from ? Even today a lot of it comes from the sketchpads of eccentric inventors like David Jones <p> GENIUS , said Thomas Edison famously , is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration . The perspiration costs lots of money : Business and government in the U.S. spend $171 billion a year in research and development to pay scientists to inch ahead with slight improvements in recombinant DNA or a PC 's browser interface . <p> But where does the inspiration come from ? Inspiration like recombining DNA or enabling PCs to browse ? A lot of the inspiration is a by-product of all that expensive perspiration . But some of it comes from people who are nowhere near a laboratory bench . They are latter-day Leonardo da Vincis doodling on sketchpads about contraptions or chemical formulations that do n't exist now  --  but just might someday . <p> One of these sketchpad inventors is David E.H . Jones , a 59-year-old Britisher whose imagination ranges far from the organic chemistry in which he got his doctorate . His published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cases by decades , such important discoveries as the chemical laser , fullerenes and carbon nanotubes , and noise cancelation devices . <p> If you have never heard of Jones , it is because he goes to great lengths to stay out of view . He almost never grants press interviews and is reluctant to allow his photograph to be published . <p> But Jones is far from invisible in the professional world . In the solitude of his study nearthe University of Newcastle upon Tyne in northeast England , he writes the Daedalus column for the British journal Nature , whose 58,000 circulation belies its influence . It numbers many of the world 's leading scientists among its readers . <p> The column is a mixture of whimsy , science fiction and deadly serious analysis . Like the mythical Greek inventor the column is named after , Daedalus stretches the limits of science . A typical column begins with a reasonable premise and carries it a little further than seems possible . The point of the exercise is to get other scientists to think " What if ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : You could make yourself invisible by wearing a shirt made of fiber-optic threads , the ends pointing out in front and back . You could improve your figure by selectively heating overendowed body parts to make it easier for fat to dissolve in those places . You could sail ships from a high-level body of water to a lower one without locks by using powerful magnetic fields acting on iron-enriched water to create a canal with a sloping waterline . <p> Preposterous ? Maybe so . But that 's what they said about heavier-than-air flying machines . " About 20% of the things that I invent make some contact with reality , " says Jones in a brief phone conversation . We were n't able to press him further because he had second thoughts about exposing himself to a broader audience , and terminated the conversation . <p> Jones envisaged a chemically powered laser in the 1960s , just when George Pimentel and Jerry Kasper of the University of California at Berkeley were designing one . Daedalus was wrong about the chemical  --  the column recommended nitroglycerin  --  but was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use such a laser toshoot down ballistic missiles , Daedalus said . The chemical laser formed the crux of the strategic defense initiative that President Reagan proposed two decades later . <p> Another great prediction was antinoise ( which , Jones later learned , had been foreseen by the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke ) . You invert the wave pattern of a regularly repeating noise , broadcast the resulting waves with the right timing and let the peaks and troughs cancel , producing silence . Two years ago the technology was commercially marketed to hush up private jets  --  the very application Daedalus cited in 1966 . <p> His most dramatic prediction came in another 1966 column . This item noted that the chicken-wire-like sheets of carbon atoms in graphite were normally flat but might be induced to curve inward to form balls if certain defects were introduced into the lattice . The resulting hollow , cagelike molecules would have intriguing properties : You could entrap other atoms inside or exploit the roller-bearing properties of the molecules as a lubricant . <p> Thus were conceived fullerenes , the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synthesized in the late 1980s by the Americans Richard Smalley and Robert Curl and the Englishman Sir Harold Kroto , who won the 1996 Nobel Prize in chemistry for this work . ( The scientists were evidently not aware of Daedalus ' musings on carbon molecules . ) <p> No one has yet made money off fullerenes , but the field has already shown itself to be far more than a mere playground for chemists . A fullerene variant known as a carbon nanotube  --  in which the sheet rolls up into a sausage  --  may well prove the next big thing in microminiaturization . Carbon tubes are among the thinnest wires and  --  given the nature of the carbon bond  --  the strongest , too . They have many electronic talents : Build them with a bit of a twist and the conductivity changes . Touch a tube 's open end to metal and it will suck it in like milk through a straw . Some scientists even talk of one day supplanting silicon with carbon . <p> Jones is something of a recluse  --  unmarried , childless and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Newcastle University 's laboratories but is not directly employed there since he quit a professorship in 1979 . <p> In a world where talented people scramble for money and recognition , Jones is a throwback . He works on what interests him , not on what is most salable . Was Napoleon poisoned , as has been long suspected by historians ? Jones proposed that Napoleon 's house on the island of St. Helena could have had green wallpaper , and that the green dye might have contributed to the emperor 's death in 1821 . <p> Later it was confirmed that Napoleon 's wallpaper had indeed been green , and that in the right temperature and humidity conditions such wallpaper could poison the residents of a house . <p> On rare occasions Jones does experimental work . He once tried to design a series of unridable bicycles just to find out why normal bicycles are so stable . ( The fascinating results were published in the April 1970 issue of Physics Today . ) In 1982 Jones created a pseudo-perpetual-motion machine . The purpose of the machine  --  which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no obvious source of energy  --  was to stimulate museum visitors to think about the paradoxes of thermodynamics  --  and to be skeptical of inventors who claimed to have created cost-free energy . <p> But the core of Daedalus is what physicists call a gedanken ( thought ) experiment . A thought experiment is an evocative kind of brainteaser that poses or answers a riddle in science . Albert Einstein imagined how the world might look if you were to travel alongside a ray of light , and hatched his relativity theory . J. Robert Oppenheimer imagined a star so small and dense that its gravity would prevent light from escaping : a black hole . <p> Some recent thoughts from Jones : You could invent a pill that would release enough oxygen into the body to keep you going long enough to get out of a burning house . You could tether a geosynchronous satellite to earth with a superstrong cable , then hoist payloads into orbit by running an electric winch up the cable . <p> Could you ? Maybe someone should try . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> By Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
