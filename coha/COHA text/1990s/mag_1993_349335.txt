TITLE : LATER LIFE <P> AUTHOR : A.R . GURNEY <P> WHERE : OFF-BROADWAY <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : A wistful comedy suggests that the biggest emotional risk is trying to avoid emotional risks . <P> Is it better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all ? The question is not exactly new , but it has rarely been posed more deftly and disarmingly than in the 21st work of the wistful comedist A.R . Gurney , whose best previous plays ( Sweet Sue , Love Letters ) also centered on the disruptive consequences of love unpursued . Gurney is often pegged as an elegist for the waning Wasp . In Later Life he makes great efforts to usher in characters outside that stereotype . They are Irish , Jewish , Texan and techno-nerd ; one woman is a lesbian , one man gay , and these two fully transcend sketch comedy to offer poignant glimpses of self-destructive lives . Predictably , however , the central figure is a Wasp , and an uptight one at that . <P> Charles Kimbrough , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitcom Murphy Brown , makes this performance subtler and deeper and eschews the trademark grimaces of someone who has just smelled something foul . The action unfolds during a cocktail party where he meets , courts , wins and loses a woman ( the incandescent Maureen Anderman ) whom he knew three decades before . The youthful infatuation ended with her offering herself and his declining , not out of prudishness but from a lifelong premonition that something terrible was going to happen and from a courtly determination not to have anyone share his doom . <P> By the end of the party , he senses that " something terrible " actually did befall him : the paralyzing fear of risk that made his outwardly orderly life an emotional wasteland . It paralyzes him again , at the moment when his second- chance love is deciding whether to return to an abusive husband . Kimbrough , ever the gentleman , remains to comfort others : a female friend grieving over widowhood and a gay male stranger sobbing over a lost lover and a dead dog . They have known love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance  --  every life , even his own .
