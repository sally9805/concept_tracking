<p> ELMHURST , N.Y .  --  Anupam Parikh 's cramped newsstand , with newspapers and magazines in languages from Mandarin to Urdu , is a link back home for the thousands of new immigrants who settle in this 3-square-mile patch of New York City every year . <p> Parikh , who emigrated from India in 1987 , takes his diverse clientele seriously . He 's learning Spanish by listening to language tapes and greets a regular customer with a few words in her native Greek . The Haiti Observateur sits next to Hong Kong 's Ming Pao Daily News . <p> " I love India but , you know , there is possibility right now I can make more money here , " the soft-spoken 41-year-old entrepreneur says . Parikh has a classic immigrant 's agenda : economic opportunity for himself and a brighter future for his children . <p> He 's not alone , especially in this neighborhood . Over the past five years , nearly 13,000 legal immigrants have come to Elmhurst  --  ZIP code 11373  --  from a stunning 123 different countries . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code in the United States , according to a USA TODAY computer analysis of Immigration and Naturalization Service records from 1991 to 1995 , the most recent year available . <p> Nationwide , the United States is in an immigration boom . As the 20th century draws to a close , immigration levels are higher than they 've been since the century began . Nearly 1.2 million immigrants are arriving in the USA every year , about 900,000 legally and an estimated 275,000 illegally . At the century 's start , the immigration was largely European . Now immigrants are more likely to be from India and the Philippines , Mexico and the Dominican Republic . <p> That 's changing the face of the USA and fueling the continuing debate over immigration . The issue is explored on PBS at 10 tonight ( check local listings ) in Looking for America . The PBS State of the Union documentary , produced with the participation of USA TODAY , airs on the Columbus Day holiday that by tradition marks America 's discovery . <p> Elmhurst has been dealing with immigration since 1652 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For successive waves of immigrants , this neighborhood has been a toehold in a new land . <p> ' Where are the Americans ? ' <p> Peter Brimelow , an immigration policy critic and author of Alien Nation , stands at a busy intersection of Elmhurst and views the morning scene with obvious distaste . <p> " Where are the Americans ? " he demands . <p> The corner bodega has a faded sign in the window announcing the grocery 's willingness to accept checks from the federal nutrition program for needy pregnant women , infants and children . A steady stream of students heads to school . <p> " The kids that we see on the streets have been educated at the expense of the American taxpayer , " Brimelow says . The influx of immigrant children has overwhelmed schools and prompted native-born Americans to endure long commutes to work so their children can attend suburban schools instead . <p> " You ca n't show that it benefits the Americans on the whole to have this presence here , " he says . <p> But New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watches neighborhoods like Elmhurst and sees something entirely different . <p> The latest wave of immigrants has boosted the city 's population and revitalized its economy , he says . The New York Planning Department this year released a generally positive analysis of their effect . <p> " These are things people do n't realize about immigrants , " Giuliani says . " They work in higher percentages than native Americans . They start businesses in slightly higher percentages . So these are net contributors to our economy . " <p> A National Academy of Sciences study released this spring provides ammunition for both sides . <p> The report estimates that immigrants provide an annual net economic gain of $ 1 billion to $ 10 billion , a modest amount in an $ 8 trillion economy . Nationwide , the additional cost to a native-born household also is modest , $ 166 to $ 226 a year in higher state and local taxes . ( In California , with the most new arrivals , the cost spikes to $ 1,178 . ) <p> Immigrants have revitalized urban neighborhoods . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of low-skilled native-born Americans . <p> Recent headlines in New York 's papers spotlight the problems : Police officers are accused of brutalizing a Haitian immigrant . Deaf Mexican immigrants are enslaved in an immigrant-run peddling ring . A space heater in crowded immigrant housing sparks a deadly fire . <p> In Elmhurst , too , some of the housing has been illegally converted into tiny apartments for large immigrant families . The schools are crowded and the local hospital overwhelmed . <p> " Sometimes tensions come from other places and spill here  - -  the Pakistanis and the Indian-Americans will clash , or some South American border wars will erupt , " says John Sabini , the New York City Council member who represents this part of Queens . " Then there are tensions between the residents who have been here a long time and the new residents . " <p> But the new residents have been drawn to the neighborhood for the same reasons that Irish , Italian and Jewish immigrants settled here earlier in the century . The No. 7 subway offers easy access to service jobs in Manhattan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new arrival can find compatriots from his or her native land . <p> Shoppers can buy live eels at the Chinese market or Bangladeshi vegetables from a corner stand . A Mexican vendor hawks ice cream in Spanish from a pushcart on the sidewalk in front of a shop that sells the saris Indian women wear . <p> " Any place that has lots of people , particularly if they 're diverse , presents challenges , " Giuliani acknowledges . " Most of those challenges , however , result in tremendously good things happening for the city . " <p> But Brimelow says , " The idea that a larger number of people , a large number of factions , is going to make society easier to work is just incredibly naive . " <p> Despite their divergent views , both Brimelow and Giuliani have a first-hand perspective . Brimelow , born in Britain , is a naturalized U.S. citizen who came to this nation in the 1970s . All four of Giuliani 's grandparents came here from Italy at the turn of the century  --  one grandfather a barber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great hopes , great expectations , tremendous desire , the proverbial streets paved with gold , and probably found a difficult time , " Giuliani says . " But they were very happy . They were very happy to be in America . " <p> No future in India <p> Anupam Parikh echoes their story . <p> In the Indian state of Gujarat , the Parikh family owned mills that produced textiles . But India 's sputtering economy meant most of their 104 looms were shut down . One of his sisters had moved to the USA with her Indian-born husband . By becoming a naturalized citizen , she was able to get U.S. visas for her parents and siblings  --  an example of the family-linked migration that accounts for most current immigrants . <p> When Parikh arrived in New York , he first learned how to operate a small business by working in one . Then , using money borrowed interest-free from family members , he and his brother bought the International News shop . <p> With a business degree from Gujarat University , Parikh says running the business is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfying such diverse customers requires extra effort . He carefully monitors his stock of publications in languages he can not read . He tries to hire clerks of various nationalities . <p> For his wife , Apeksha Parikh , 35 , coping with life in America and raising two sons without her extended family can be lonely . <p> But the parents ' expectations for their boys , both U.S. citizens by birth , are high . Rushabh is likely to become a doctor , their father declares , and Shrujal an engineer . <p> These days , however , 4-year-old Shrujal is in nursery school and 5-year-old Rushabh in kindergarten . His school , P.S. 7 , is just 3 years old but already operates at nearly double its capacity . <p> In Rushabh 's class , all 25 of the students are immigrants or the children of immigrants . Their families come from a dozen nations and speak eight languages . <p> " When I first started teaching I said , ' How am I going to communicate with them ? ' " recalls Lisa Bernabeo , at 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned to plow ahead in English . <p> The school year starts with daily lessons in American citizenship . " Who can tell me what this is called ? " Bernabeo asks , holding up an American flag . The class hesitantly recites the Pledge of Allegiance . <p> When he heads off to school , Rushabh sports an all-American outfit of bluejeans and Bert-and-Ernie backpack . But when visitors arrive at his family 's apartment , both boys are wearing traditional Indian kurtas , long shirts over wide trousers and silk vests . <p> Anupam and Apeksha Parikh worry about their sons losing their Indian roots . <p> The family speaks its native language , Gujarati , at home . They are vegetarians and members of an ancient Indian religion known as Jain . A frame house a few blocks from their apartment building has been converted to a Jain Temple , the sweet smell of incense floating from its doors . <p> Now , after a decade in this country , the Parikhs are considering the next step in their classic immigrants ' journey . Anupam , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply for citizenship . With their family finances established , he and Apeksha are discussing whether it 's time to leave their Elmhurst apartment and move to the suburbs on Long Island . <p> " Because everyone says in New York to raise kids is very tough , " says Anupam . Apeksha adds , " The school is much better .
