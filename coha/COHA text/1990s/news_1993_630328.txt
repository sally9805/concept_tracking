<p> London has been the mecca for English-speaking theatergoers for four centuries , ever since a fellow named William Shakespeare took pen to paper and transformed the history of drama . <p> Today , the city remains a vital creative center , although there is a palpable nervousness on every level of the theater community . That includes the dwindling number of independent commercial producers in the West End ( the equivalent of Broadway ) ; the managers and artistic directors of the three major government-subsidized theater institutions ( the National Theatre , the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal Court Theatre ) , and the operators of the numerous Fringe theaters , which most closely resemble Chicago 's Off-Loop companies . <p> Weak spots are beginning to show in what has always appeared , at least to Americans , to be an indestructible theatrical fabric . A vast national debt , a lingering recession and government cutbacks to the arts are among the causes of concern . Terrorist activities in the central city have taken a toll at the box office . And add to that increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but large-scale escapist musicals and the unusual number of empty West End houses . <p> In fact , the problems facing London theater are beginning to sound remarkably similar to those faced by theaters in Chicago and New York . <p> " On the surface , there seems to be health and vitality , especially in the new crop of young directors who have been making their mark , " said Michael Billington , drama critic at the Guardian newspaper . " But the healthy glow may very well be illusory , like a suntan that could fade at any minute . " <p> Of course , it is still possible to spend a week in London and catch a slew of classics , from Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde to the recently rediscovered Terrence Rattigan . And it also is possible to catch up on new plays by Tom Stoppard ( " Arcadia " ) ; Alan Ayckbourn ( " Time of My Life ) ; David Hare ( " The Absence of War , " arriving at the National Theatre in September , to run in repertory with the earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Racing Demons " ) , and Peter Shaffer ( " The Gift of the Gorgon , " which is headed for Broadway ) . Even Harold Pinter is back in business , with his first new full-length play in many years , which is promised for next season . <p> How can such a high level of activity continue in the face of economic woes and changing audiences ? Here are some of the reasons why London theater continues to thrive . Tradition <p> The British are a theatergoing nation by nature and by habit . <p> " There is still a sizable , hard-core group of educated , enthusiastic and discerning theatergoers in this country who believe that theater is simply an essential part of life , " said Genista McIntosh , executive director of the National Theatre . <p> Producers and artistic directors , however , are concerned about the graying of their audience and the diminished interest of the young , who gravitate toward spectacle-like musicals . But for now , at least , the core audience is vital and engaged . Government subsidies <p> National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the arts since Margaret Thatcher 's regime , and the budget cuts during the current recession are taking a toll as well . But the British government 's support of the arts remains massive , and is absolutely essential to the survival of the National Theatre , the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal Court Theatre . <p> By U.S. standards , the extent of this government aid is nothing short of mind-boggling . At the National and RSC , about 40 percent of each company 's annual budget of about $ 40 million is government-subsidized . At the considerably smaller Royal Court , subsidies account for about 43 percent of the annual budget , or about $ 1.7 million . <p> The investment pays off in the long run because these theaters are able to mount superb productions with a frequency and consistency that otherwise would be impossible . And many of these companies ' productions move on to bolster the West End , before triggering the inevitable chain reaction with Broadway and American regional theater . <p> Even with subsidies , money problems are constant . One innovation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a national lottery in which a significant percentage of the receipts will be earmarked for the arts . Many arts organizations are unhappy about this development , believing that the government may use the lottery as an excuse to discontinue direct subsidies . Tourism <p> Large numbers of people from around the world travel to London specifically to attend the theater . And many others consider a stop at a West End production or major subsidized house an essential part of their trip . <p> Susan Wittington , director of development for the Society of West End Theatre , the advocacy and marketing organization for London 's commercial West End and major subsidized theaters , said annual theater attendance in recent seasons has ranged from 10.2 million to 11 million , with total ticket revenues reaching about $ 331 million in 1991 , the most recent calculation . These figures do not even include the scores of Fringe theaters scattered throughout the city . <p> ( Any comparison to Chicago is difficult because the League of Chicago Theatres has not compiled annual attendance or revenue records since 1989 . In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nearly one-third of London theatergoers are overseas tourists . They are wooed by SWET 's marketing schemes . Some of the group 's tactics are basic , including syndicated theater listings in the major dailies , a lively calendar of productions available in theater lobbies and a highly visible half-price ticket booth in Leicester Square , in the heart of the tourist district . <p> Other efforts are more sophisticated , including an annual Stagefair exposition , which this year will introduce more than 1,000 travel industry heavies to the delights of London theater by plying them with tickets , seminars and backstage tours . Playwright commissions <p> Nearly every theater in London has an ongoing program of commissions , which encourages playwrights to create works . " We have about 30 writers , including Caryl Churchill , Timberlake Wertenbaker and Derek Walcott , under commission , " said Graham Cowley , general manager of the Royal Court . " And it can take anywhere from six months to six years for their projects to reach fruition . " <p> At the Hampstead Theatre Company , one of the principal Fringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is receiving its British premiere , artistic director Jenny Topper puts her faith in the commissioning process . She has about six writers in her stable . <p> " Getting new work by our established writers is not all that difficult , " said the National Theatre 's Genista McIntosh . " But getting work by new , young writers - work that can be played for quite large audiences - is a very different matter . So we 've begun something we call a ' New Writing Initiative , ' which workshops and showcases young , multicultural talent . " Refreshments <p> London theatre has a genuine party spirit , which begins well before the curtain goes up and extends well past the intermission or " interval , " as the British call it . <p> At the National and the RSC , restaurants , sandwich bars and cafes are scattered throughout the lobbies . Many of the smaller Fringe theaters also have these facilities . <p> Before the show and at intervals , there is a mass exodus to the lobby bars . And nearly every non-drinking audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup or cone that can be taken back to one 's seat . All this eating and drinking tends to make theatergoing in London a much more enjoyable and less sanitized activity . Affordable tickets <p> Although London ticket prices are rising , especially for musicals ( the top price for the new Andrew Lloyd Webber show , " Sunset Boulevard , " is about $ 54 ) , West End tickets are still cheaper than Broadway , with some seats as low as $ 12 , and half-price tickets frequently available on the day of performance . <p> At the subsidized theaters , top prices are about $ 30 , with less expensive options available . And at the Fringe theaters , tickets are usually less than $ 20.
