Down the dusty road , and down the river , down below the Bull Cafe . The sun is up and Luster rises . A long hair divides the dog 's water dish into the yin-yang . Luster leans to her toothbrush . The roots of her hair throb in her scalp , her heavy hair . She is naked , and sweating already . Uncle Bud and Aunt Judy . Why did she think of them now ? They had matching tattoos of lips on the cheeks of their butts . Kiss , kiss . <p> Now Crawford comes in behind her ; he 's been watching her from the bed , trying to make sense of her skinny ass . This is a long way out in the country , a long goddamn way out . From the window you can see farther than you can imagine , away off into nothing and then some . Out there are the cows with their long , gaunt faces . <p> Already the horizon is dusty . Away off and hidden in the huge country , an automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn , gravel pecking its dusty chrome . Joe , the driver , believes in the power of the land to redeem him . He leans forward into the oncoming country as if to wish it true . <p> Luster makes a pass through the kitchen for a glass of water . It 's the middle of the morning , and Crawford should n't be here , he ought to be out shuffling dirt or throwing hay , doing farmer things . Crawford 's got no sense anymore . But here she goes  --  she stops herself ; no need yelling down that well . This is a rickety place , soon to be gone out of their hands . They have surrounded themselves with this land , she and Crawford . Now it lies like a bed gone hard , a thing to be endured . <p> The air coming through the kitchen window takes a little of the heat off with it . She drinks her water , feeling a push at her gut  --  some feeling trying to talk to her . The message seems to ride along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the message from the heat . <p> Crawford goes out the front , slowly . The day stands before him . More than a whole world , a universe . From this moment it spreads in both directions forever ; like the ocean . Bigger . Too big . He brings it down , brings his footsteps down the sandy beach he has imagined . Ahead of him a couple romps and laughs . She , in a green swimsuit cut in plunging angles as if to lift parts of her higher ; he with a beard . Crawford passes on , to the barn and beyond . He must catch the horses , shuffle dirt , toss hay . Farmer things . <p> Heat rises . Already he feels the day has beaten him . Ahead , the immense brown hills roll one into the other , dividing the wind in winter , rising now into the heat . From time to time sparrows flush from among the clods and beat off into the white morning . Luster watches Crawford from the kitchen window , staggering angrily among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slants against the tractor tire , propped like a hoe handle for a long time . Luster is provoked . Why does n't something kill the idiot ? She breathes hard and then looks back out to the catch-pen on the slope below the barn . She has no explanation for her feelings . <p> The cow comes over the hill fast . Crawford whacks her once with the stick , and then she hooks at him and snorts but misses . She shakes her old head and falls backward . But she 's right back up and coming at him again , which surprises him . He raises the bat to whack her . Again and again , until she falls , bloody snout first , into the dirt , groveling there with her ass still raised up , her long tail thrashing , like she might kick up and lunge at him and kill him this time . So he keeps the bat cocked over his head . Then her legs tangle in her big bag of an udder and she falls , her eyes roll to white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tonk Myrkle shows up ; he has walked up the road , and behind him is his daughter . Early mornings Myrkle 's daughter sings a clear song that comes down across the hills like air ; then when she comes to work she 's all quiet . Today is Friday . Crawford and Tonk will drag the cow away into the boneyard gully . Turkey vultures roost in the trees along the rim of the ravine , and occasionally one of them spreads its wings to air . When a breeze moves , the salty stink of the dead cattle comes up to the house . <p> Luster goes away from the window and begins her work , but when Myrkle 's daughter comes in , Luster goes to the bedroom and stretches out on top of the plowed sheets . The swish of the broom comes and goes  --  down the hall , out to the porch ; the door latch clicks back into its pocket ; blackbirds call their rusty songs across the pasture ; the fan buzzes Luster to sleep . <p> When has she slept like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into that long , falling night of silver-streaked music : she and Crawford fucking on the front porch , time and again and throwing the rubbers off into the flower bed ; and the earth slipping from beneath them , down into the dark pond where turtles have eaten all of the fish from the dangling hooks of the trotline , except for the fishes ' lips left drifting there like the rolled rims of the rubbers , kisses left behind in some years-ago abandoned barroom ? <p> Crawford comes in to lunch in a ripped shirt . " Who 's home ? " he yells like an idiot from the moon . He waits for Luster to dish up their food from the stove . She 's a good cook by habit , almost accidentally . She moves around the stove with the two plates held in one hand and a big spoon in the other . When she sets the plates on the table , Crawford starts in , but she goes back to the stove and dishes up plates for Tonk Myrkle and his daughter , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the porch where Tonk is waiting . <p> Luster calls the dog to the back , to the screened porch , and pours crumbled food in his dish . Now the feeding is done . She has done this one thing . <p> Crawford looks up when Luster sits to her plate . " It 's good , " he says , and then he 's back at it . <p> Luster watches him a minute and then she starts to eat , too . He 's the best friend she has . <p> " Mercy , " he says when he finishes . It 's like a request . <p> " So , tell me about your life , " Crawford says . <p> " I do n't really have much to say . " <p> He watches her , it must be forever . He says , " No need gnawing ourselves to the bone . " Then his smile comes back . They have begun to look like each other , he and Luster . What joy they have comes to their faces and lingers there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives together they have bludgeoned each other with this happiness . <p> He gets up to go , but Luster takes him from the kitchen to the bed and they lie still in the wind from the fan . The dog comes in and wants to be petted , his snout propped on the edge of the bed , his face gaunt like the cows ' faces . Tonk Myrkle and his daughter wait somewhere outside . The whole countryside lies as if waiting , and scalding blankets of heat rise everywhere off the land . <p> Tonight , for the first time , Luster goes out across the pasture to look in the neighbor 's window . She is drunk but she is n't crazy . Her feet make a trail of black prints on the silver-dewy grass and her legs rise into the light of the high moon and then fall again into the darkness of her own shadow . She walks naked ; this is her indulgence . <p> The kitchen light is on and she watches the woman making dinner . Thin radio music coming out through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of onions . The woman moves from the sink to the stove to the cupboards like a person who believes she is alone . Now and then she speaks , neither to herself nor to the cat who sits on the table  --  " Do n't forget the butter , " she says , " and the plate . " The cat watches in that predictable way that cats watch , twitching its tail , indifferent , detached . <p> Her name is Marla , she is a widow , and this is all Luster knows . Almost all . Sometimes late at night she calls on the phone . Neither Luster nor Crawford knows how the widow got their number , their names . How does anybody know anybody else in this country ? It 's old country , but people come and go . Luster has heard that the widow 's house was in her father 's family . She came here with her husband to retire , and then he died , and now the woman stays , alone and unknown , because the house is hers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk . One of them throws off the sheet and goes in to catch the phone . Usually it 's Luster . And she listens to endless monologues , about the rabbits the woman had as a child , the unusual color of the walls in a motel room where she stayed once with her husband . Trying to name those memories . <p> Now as Luster watches , Marla empties a pan onto the plate and sits down to eat with her back to the window ; Luster sees only the back of her head , gray hair tangled at the crown , a small , rigid head balanced like an egg above shoulders as knotty as gate posts . Luster is seduced by the quiet order of this life . This awful life . <p> When Marla offers spoonfuls from her plate , the cat refuses by closing its eyes . She gets up and goes to bring another glass of water to the table , and the cat suddenly stops twitching its tail , perks its ears even more stiffly upward , opens its eyes , and looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is done , Marla puts her dishes in the sink and turns off the kitchen overhead light . For a moment , the tip of a cigarette moves , as if alone . Luster feels that she might lose her balance , though her feet are on the ground . <p> Then the screen door opens  --  the cricket sound of the hinges and crying spring  --  and she steps onto the back porch . In her hand is an oily glass of water , the only hint of coolness in this moment of her watched life . And Luster drifts , she sees the moment play itself out slowly like a slow song , like a season , like a story she is trying to imagine : <p> In a few minutes the woman will go back into the house , back in to whatever is or is n't there . In the meantime , her feet will remain planted here on the years-ago painted planks of the porch . The back porch where everything should be quiet and cool , but where the leak water has dripped a hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scars where the men dragged the washing machine across into the kitchen are deep in the wood . And the chinaberry tree that gives no shade , not even a moon shadow  --  when it put on berries its leaves gave all their strength , and now they hang weakly among the wrinkled berries , things about to evaporate ; and beneath the tree is dust , the roots scratched bare by the dog , and now the dog lies among the feathery rootless imagining that he is cooling himself , but he pants , and he is as hot and dry as the galvanized chain that attaches him to the tree . The woman , Marla , is craving a dragging down ; even as she drags on her cigarette , she wants to be dragged into the dust , where she can imagine like the dog that she is cool and in love again , where there is no stopping for caution or for cleanliness , where there is no stopping to brush your teeth . <p> But she remains , foot-planted on the porch . And Luster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unafraid . In the moonlit yard is a corn cob , forever attacked and scratched by hens . <p> The oily glass of water , tossed at the heat-drunken dog beneath the chinaberry tree , is no substitute for tears . And the boards of the porch creak as Marla steps back through the already-slamming screen door and disappears into the bleak shelter of the house . <p> And somewhere inside , the life goes on ; in or out , on it goes . The crickets take up their fiddles and bows , and the night is deadly full of their racket . The moon comes out again through the low horizon clouds and then plunges again into the clouds , again and again racing down , poking its blue face again and again at the earth . Luster watches this dance , leaning against the house now , waiting for nothing  --  the old back and forth , front and back , head and tail , face and ass . But there are no equal opposites , there are only continuous surfaces and continuous dreams , each becoming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water is no more and no less kind than the flicked cigarette that lands in the dog 's fur . And the dog , who smolders beneath the chinaberry tree , and then flames briefly and gloriously into the night , is no more and no less bright than the sun and the moon and the woman waiting alone through the shabby night . <p> Luster comes back across the pasture in the night , slowly , like a small swimmer , back as if from sleep , into their moonlit bedroom . She watches Crawford sleep , his hair black , his skin pale in this soft light , bedclothes thrown off because of the late summer heat . She moves carefully into the bed . <p> " Are you breathing ? " she says . <p> " What 's wrong ? " he says . <p> " Nothing , " she tells him . She wonders . The bed sinks beneath her . <p> " Where 've you been ? " he says . <p> " Walking in the pasture with no clothes on . " " Really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking over at him . His eyes are dosed and Luster can see a smile . <p> " That 's lovely . " <p> She waits for a time in the dark . <p> " I 've been over to the widow 's , " she says . <p> His eyes are still closed . He waits , silent , the darkness lying between them . <p> " I watched her burn her dog , " Luster begins . <p> The bed moves ; he shifts to listen . " What ? " he says . She tells him the whole senseless story . And then he wants to hear it again . He always wants to hear her stories again . <p> " Do you think she 's crazy ? " Luster says . <p> " What was she wearing ? " <p> " Nothing . " <p> " You 're lying , " Crawford says finally . " She did n't burn the dog . " <p> " She was wearing a blanket , " Luster says . <p> Later he dreams about his childhood friend , a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother that swimming was a matter of sucking in huge gulps of water . " Like a fish , " he told them . " That 's all a fish does . " <p> In the dream , Fish rides across Crawford 's pasture on a burning horse . The other Fish , the real one , bottom-upped a Thunderbird and drowned in Runningwater Creek . <p> Here they lie , Crawford and Luster , sleeping , sucking life from the night around them . Their bodies rise and fall , gently , sheltered beneath the moon-reflecting roof , anchored to the earth . <p> Joe drives his Buick relentlessly through the country . The swaying needles of the dashboard gauges follow the curves of the road , confirming the motion of the landscape , warning of nothing . The day rushes toward him : hill and woodland , creek and curve and dirty weeds , the smell of heat  --  shadow patches flash and fade . Behind the speeding car all dissolves into a boiling fog of dust ; ahead , wide country begins to open . He is lured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lured by simple lust to see the next and the next and the next , his thoughts galloping ahead of the Buick , his dusty past yapping at the tires like a mongrel dog . And from time to time he leans his big face out the window to get the smells of the land . The air informs him . He knows he is close to the promised land . <p> From her kitchen window , Luster can see all the way over into the black woods across the river , far beyond the puny trail of dust that rises now and again from the road  --  so far over that the trees become not trees but a continuous rough and nappy mat covering some secret or abandoned part of the earth  --  and beyond the corner of the lowest field , where the river makes its hard bend to the north , she sees the bright water . Back on this side of the lowland , the hills come up in careful stages , rolling toward her easily in long folds , one into the other , like muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in motion beneath her , slipping ever so gently . A small , shiny lake is caught between two of these folds of the earth , and nearer the house several thickets of cedar stand on outcroppings of chalk from which the dark earth was allowed to wash carelessly away in the times of cheap land . <p> Behind her , she hears Myrkle 's daughter slopping the string mop in and out of the steel bucket and then swishing it across the brick floor of the kitchen . The noise is buoyant , tireless , like the sound of the ocean  --  collapsing , collapsing , and ever lifting its huge weight to collapse again . Luster wishes for the ocean , that child 's place . Used to be , when she was a girl , Bud and Judy took her down to Biloxi every summer . Late on those Friday nights they took off south in the Plymouth , through the heat and crickets  --  Macon , Shuqualak , Wahalak , Scooba , and Meridian , and down into the pine woods . It all seems one long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a broad back seat : exhaustion and exhaust fumes , Bud stopping somewhere south of Laurel and the hissing sound of his piss leaking onto the road bank , and when the Plymouth moved off again Luster watching the moonlight walk through the palmetto swamp , and ahead dawn and the car pulled down on the hard sand , hot sleep and flesh and ribbons of paint peeling from the flank of the Plymouth where hot exhaust leaked against the metal . Bud and Judy 's sweaty tattoo lips kissing on the front seat . <p> Now Luster is dribbling Three Roses whiskey into a coffee cup . She moves and the earth moves . Earlier this afternoon Crawford and Tonk drove the yearling cattle over into the ravine . She watched the stupidly awkward animals stretch their long necks and hurtle toward the lake , and then turn , at what seemed the moment before they would plunge into the water , and sweep out of sight beyond the thicket . <p> And now , away off , Luster sees the horses , running wildly , their riders bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills they come , disappearing into the shadowy cleavage where one hill lies against another , and then reappearing larger , nearer , until she can see the horses heaving against the earth and against the heat , running with their ears pinned , running with their hearts . And then nearer , the riders , Crawford and Tonk , lanky , one white and one black but both dark now against the white horizon , girthed to their animals and stretching forward , grinning like mischief and death , thrusting themselves into the last few yards of the race to the corner of the house . <p> Then they are past and out of sight . Luster backs away from the window , breathing out a long , held breath , the clap of the hoofs and the throaty grunts of the winded animals coming to her like afterthoughts , like recent memories . They 'll ruin the horses . What will be lost ? Everything . <p> Myrkle 's daughter bends double , wringing her dirty mop into the metal bucket . The girl has left a dry island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shines like fresh perspiration  --  the cool odor of brick . Luster leans and kisses the girl , and she speaks to her : " Odelia . " <p> In the past , evil seemed a sinister and invisible disease  --  the sound of a single coughing calf coming across the hills at night , the unplanted crop , the interest on their bank notes mounting darkly against them . Again Luster feels the seductive motion of the earth beneath her , and she reaches for the table . She is ashamed , and she finds no relief . Meanwhile Odelia moves forward , bluntly and smoothly like a fish . <p> Then Crawford comes in at the back door . Here he is . And behind him she sees Tonk Myrkle , a stick of a man , sucking a cigarette , his black face disappearing into his jaw socket with each drag . And then the smoke comes out , and there is his face again . And Odelia , standing like that over her mop . Something important is happening . Crawford knows this , too ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect of him ? What does she expect ? But the silence , the stillness must run its course . And they wait . <p> Tonk Myrkle and his daughter are here like witnesses , not to a crime , but to their lives . " Here they are , " the witnesses might testify at any moment . " Here they are ; their lives are happening . " And after they are gone , after the farm has been sold , the tales Tonk and Odelia will tell of their lives  --  tales told over long hours , told with beer breath , told to women and men who have already heard again and again  --  the stories becoming part of the landscape , evidence of passing , like the shell gully where the ocean used to be , but fading faster , like the automobile down there among the cedars , rusted and shot full of bullet holes , fading with days and weather . They will be a long time gone from this place ; they will be forgotten soon enough . <p> Luster is wearing only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lie down here naked on the cool bricks , and they could take their pleasure like punishment , she and Crawford , take their false penance here in front of the witnesses . The story would be over . She is astonished at their life together . <p> She goes to the bedroom and pulls her pants on . She tries to imagine the moments Tonk and Odelia will remember , the moments they will tell again and again . The men and women at the Bull Cafe will remember them carelessly . But Luster buttons her pants , as if this is the only thing happening . <p> Now she grabs a side of the bedclothes and pumps them once , so that they buoy with air and come back down to the bed slowly ; she smooths the thick spread toward the pillows with her forearms . <p> Myrkle 's daughter stands in the bedroom doorway , Luster 's dark shadow . " Mister Crawford say . <p> " What is it , Odelia ? " <p> " He say him and Daddy out to the truck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make much sense , does it  --  making up the bed ? " <p> " People got to do , " Odelia says , her typical wisdom . <p> Luster kisses her again . " We 'll be good tonight . " <p> And then they are in the pickup , Luster between Crawford and Odelia , and Tonk next to the door , the little dash-mounted fan blasting breathy air into her face , the bite of the Three Roses gone now , but resting somewhere . Tonk smells of salt and of sour oats . The hot outside air comes toward them like the road and divides before them  --  from the corner of her eye , Luster sees the fringes of the hot , stirred air fluffing the dust-powdered bushes along the sides of the road  --  but she looks ahead now , as if for some new road sign pointing toward occurrence , her confidence in the moment slipping . <p> The evening will begin and end with beer sucked from long bottles . Pleasure has become habit . <p> Some ways ahead , Joe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he passes , past thicket and gully and abandoned silo . Past thin Leota , walking fast . Past the Bull Cafe where three men turn quickly into the parking lot , throwing beer cans to the heat , throwing bits of dry gravel from beneath the rolling wheels of their car to ping against the tin wall of the cafe-shack . <p> And inside , the band is warming up for the long Saturday evening ; two men playing guitars , another with a horn , playing without style , as if this were a part of their punishment . Inside , long-faced men and women tell stories and lies . But Joe passes on , heading directly for the land he intends to buy , looking for the place where he will begin his glorious new life . The cloud of dust behind the Buick rises , like a message , hundreds of feet into the white sky . Beneath this fading cloud , Crawford and Luster and Tonk and Odelia make their evening journey to the Bull Cafe . <p> On the long rise before the abandoned church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tired mule . From the crest of the hill , scraps of music come to them ; they roll easily on down . <p> The saxophone player blows into his dented horn , his song like something learned in the metal walled classroom of a vocational school , a song to be dismantled like an automobile engine . Voices call to them from the dark edges of the room  --  the crack of pool balls , smells of dirt and cement and metal . Later Crawford holds beer bottles to his ears and invents the music : noise , landscape , motion , and human touch . Tonk and Odelia dance , incestuous and chicken-necked , like interpreters of the song . <p> Night has come wholly on when Joe walks in , the Buick left idling in the parking lot , headlights on high beam and thrown directly into the doorway behind him  --  a shadow just a step ahead of his own dust  --  all darkness with a silver skin . He stumbles in , he hesitates . To the bar then , and back with arms full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crawford are squandering their lives , he moves without steps . " Hello , lovers , " he says and sits and spreads the beers around , and some cash falls and lies heavily on the table like the damp heat . <p> Luster looks at Crawford and says , " It 's Jesus . " <p> Crawford says , " He 's the savior all right , returned at last . " <p> They both look across at Joe . His face says ha ha , but his mouth is saying something else . Money . An obscene offer . <p> " He wants the farm , " Crawford says , as if the music might have deafened Luster . <p> " I heard him , " she says . " What about the cattle ? " <p> And Crawford turns back to Joe . " What about the cattle ? " <p> " All of it , " Joe says , this time speaking directly to Luster . <p> " We do n't own it , " she says . " We owe it all to the bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't gone . She sees the farm again through these new eyes  --  raw with possibility , raw like it was when she and Crawford moved in here eight , nine years ago , anchored their lives to this piece of earth . <p> " I know , " Joe says , " I 've been to the courthouse . And the bank . " He nods to Crawford . <p> She looks at Crawford . His face is long and eroded , like every inch of Mississippi . <p> Next week is banging at the door , and the saxophone keeps up its battered tune . <p> " That 's not enough , " Crawford says . " You pay off the bank and we 're still busted . " Tonk and Odelia dance lazily around them like evidence of desire  --  the game of need and want . <p> Joe reaches into his jacket and pulls out a wad of money the size of a small cabbage . Crawford thinks of a nightmare he has almost every night but has never told anyone : thousands of hungry hogs line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of the trough and pours an endless stream of slop from a bucket . For a moment he is frightened . Here is the money , like evidence . <p> " We need a ride , " Luster says . Something has gone wrong here . She repeats the word " need " to herself , silently . She straightens up and looks pretty . She notices her skin against her clothes . The heat is her friend , something she can touch privately . Crawford is her friend , too . This man across the table has happened to them like a tattoo happens : in an hour their lives have changed . <p> Crawford follows Joe out the door and into the parking lot , and from where she sits Luster watches their stretched and drunken shadows play in and out of the headlight beam projected through the doorway and against the far wall of the Bull . Tonk and Odelia move their smaller shadows among these , gently like the shadows of small trees . <p> Joe pulls one suitcase from the trunk . He unfolds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here it is , " he says . <p> When they come back in , Crawford says , " Even the dipstick 's broken on that car . " He bends forward like a shy dog . <p> Luster says , " Let 's go , baby , " and she gathers up the cabbage wad of money . She has counted , something over eleven hundred dollars . She does n't look at Joe . Soon she wo n't look back at all ; she tells herself this story . A kiss for Odelia . In this moment she wishes it was cabbage leaves she was folding into her pocket . <p> Tonk inherits the pickup truck . One night on the slope of the hill before the Bull , a piston will drop down through its oil pan and the truck will stop , resolute and quiet . Tonk will clutch it and roll down into the borrow pit , and there it will rust to nothing . Tonk , too , will remain here , until he falls asleep and Odelia 's song can no longer raise him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night has swallowed itself . The Buick rumbles south toward the Gulf of Mexico with deceptive speed , like a large cow . Just a short ways across the country , the widow , Marla , comes to her window , her face as disorganized as the face of a young child awakened suddenly in the middle of the night . For the moment , her whole existence is framed in her window , her self distilled into a single beam of light spilling now out into the barnyard , where her chickens chuckle from their roost in the mimosa tree , the barren yard around them and the hot night spinning with insects . The smell of the seared dog is in the air . Spoons that she has suspended by threads hang in front of the window , and these turn slowly in the air , reflecting but not mirroring . She stares at the window , but not through it . No one watches her . <p> She wears a heavy winter blanket around her shoulders , Indian-style , the way a child might play dress-up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinned at the neck with a heavy , jeweled broach . She has her hands over her ears now , her mouth is open , her eyes wide and blank . If she sees anything , she sees only the window 's reflection of her kitchen and her startling self . When she turns away the blanket trails behind her across the kitchen floor . <p> At the far side of the kitchen she reaches up to open the gray circuit box mounted on the wall . She studies the breakers for several minutes , patting the side of her neck , and then she reaches up again and begins flicking switches until there is no light in the house . <p> She dials a number on the phone . <p> She waits in the dark . The silence and the darkness fuse . She has unpinned the blanket from around her neck and now she stands naked in the thick darkness , feeling for the finger holes in <p> the phone dial . Even the silver spoons hanging in the window are invisible in the darkness . <p> She dials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says in a high , child 's voice , " the most awful thing . The power is out . I do n't know what to do , sweetheart . All the lights are out . " <p> Luster watches the hills roll and fade past the open window of the Buick  --  like the humped shadows of large , gentle dogs ; like the warm ocean miles ahead , licking toward her as if to wake her , as if to lift her onto its fat , rolling belly . Crawford imagines the ocean , too , imagines unanchoring himself and floating out . He 's been to the barrier islands several miles out beyond the beaches  --  years ago , on a strange fishing trip  --  and he remembers the brilliant green water that moved into and out of the shell lagoons along the outer coast . He 's not afraid of the water in daylight . Maybe tomorrow they 'll spend some of the wad of cash to boat out to the islands . Crawford can see the time ahead of him , clearly and broadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peaceful monotony of the ocean floor . In time he will be better , he thinks . <p> Miles of the earth run under them . They have crossed the river , and Crawford is thinking about their table in the Bull . Their old friends have begun to lean toward the table where they were sitting drinking their beers a few minutes ago . The small empty space they left will close and heal . Crawford speaks quietly into the song of the Buick , something that sounds to Luster like " Hogs lapping at the trough of sorrow . " <p> No , maybe he said " Hogs laughing ... " Luster looks across at him ; his face points into the night  --  the smiling face of the man who kills the cows . More of the road runs under them . She watches him . First chance she gets she will put back a hundred , maybe two , for herself . <p> She wants the feel of the soft , steady earth , but the land passes away , and Luster feels herself adrift again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded but not yet drowning . Union and motion . The hot , wet wind blasts against them , but they hold to the night like shadows . What day is it ? she wonders . <p> <p> By RICHARD GILES <p>
