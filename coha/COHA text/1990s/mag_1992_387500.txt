Republican Mudbath IV . <p> In the space of a few months earlier this year , readers of this magazine learned of a " Paradigm Regained " ( Fred Barnes , April 13 ) and , alas , a " Paradigm 's Loss " ( Mickey Kaus , July 27 ) . The only installment missing from this Miltonian cadence is the return to paradise , when those of us rendered meek by the recent election reinherit the earth . We 're still hoping . <p> However , it 's worth recounting how the Bush Republicans fell into this state of intellectual nakedness . The administration was , in one sense , quintessentially conservative . Bush has a wistful strain of Burkean traditionalism that led him to reflexively resist the temptation to build on what Ronald Reagan had accomplished , and the Clinton Democrats succeeded in filling the void . Bush did n't exactly pepper his language with allusions to Reflections , but his presidency was dominated by a fear of anything rash or radical . <p> It need never have been that way . Many second- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't survive the post-cold war era . Lee Atwater reread THE PRINCE every year . We came from a very different tradition  --  not " conservative , " but right-wing . Atwater was an in-your-face politico who thought the purpose of politics was to win , not just avoid losing . His favorite phrase was " keep movin ' , " a vernacular take on Whitman . Like Reagan , another anti-conservative conservative , he was happy to begin the world over again-as he would put it , " anytime , anywhere , with anybody . " And he had seen the post-Reagan dilemma coming . <p> Atwater called me into his office in January 1985 . He had signed on with Bush , and there was no time to waste  --  the presidential election was just forty-six months away . " Bush does not have an operation that is capable of taking over the country , " he told me , outlining his plan for electing Bush in 1988 . Atwater thought Bush lacked a " post-Reagan vision , " and that Jack Kemp and Gary Hart , respectively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy reading about Kemp 's virtues , Atwater and I put together " Gary Hart 's Long March , " a memo describing the Colorado Democrat 's idea-driven campaign . <p> Four years later , Bush was president . We never did get too far with the " vision thing , " but we did leaven the negatives ( " read my lips , " Willie Horton ) with some positives ( " kinder , gentler , " " education president " ) . I was Bush 's " deputy assistant for policy planning , " a title another aide and I cooked up over lunch at a Roy Rogers on Connecticut Avenue . The president 's February 9 , 1989 , address to a joint session of Congress outlined his plan for " Building a Better America . " That sounded good , but I was struck by the incrementalism of the gerunds that littered the oration : " managing , " " ordering , " " maintaining . " A few days later I wrote an earnest memo to my new boss , domestic policy adviser Roger B. Porter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold ground , but to gain ground . The economic issue would be neutralized , I said , unless the thrice-thrashed Democrats were dumb enough to propose a tax increase . ( They were n't that dumb , as it turned out . ) " We have to seek new issues that provide us with new opportunities and expand our coalition , " I wrote . " Old GOP priorities of the ' 70s and ' 80s will have to give way to new GOP priorities : the poor , children 's issues , the environment . " <p> I was no " squish , " to use the derisive Reaganite idiom . I believed that all this new activism could and should be fit within our self-imposed framework of no tax or net spending increase . The Scylla of " kinder , gentler " and the Charybdis of " no new taxes " would force us to think anew : about restructuring , innovation , " reinventing " government . Private-sector organizations were being transformed by international competition . They were changing not because they wanted to , but because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start happening in the public sector . Influenced by Kemp 's " bleeding-heart conservatism , " I added : " Reform has a moral component . It implies that there are wrongs to be righted , not just inefficiencies to be corrected . " <p> I never got a response . Naively convinced I was doing Bush 's will , I gave a speech to the Reason Foundation in early 1990 in which I touted " The New Paradigm , " a strategy for post-bureaucratic government defined by five principles : the global market , empowerment , choice , decentralization , and a principled , bottom-line commitment to what works . It seemed to me that at the end of the ' 80s , a post-Reagan , post-Tip O'Neill consensus had developed around a reasonable set of social goals : education , housing , health care , environmental protection . Americans agreed that we were n't going to throw people into the snow , but we also agreed we were n't going to build socialism . If this consensus on goals could be articulated , then the debate could shift to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This new consensus would render the old debate obsolete . Republicans would stop calling for the rollback of the welfare state , freeing the Democrats from their obligation to guard against a bureaucratic domino effect that would topple the whole New Deal-Great Society edifice . If the Bush administration led the way , I figured , we could move from rhetoric to results . I argued that if this " new paradigm " were energetically adopted , we 'd beat the party of compassion at their own game . <p> I did n't get far in the West Wing , but I did get the ear of the speechwriters . My words found their way into a 1990 Bush speech : " When old centralized bureaucracies are crumbling , the time has come for yet another paradigm ... a model which rejects the view that progress is measured in money spent and bureaucracies built . " It was a throwaway talk to a bunch of conservatives that did n't even make the next day 's WASHINGTON POST , but now " our new paradigm " was a certified Bushism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Old Paradigm came after me . <p> Atwater could have helped Bush make the paradigm shift from the Reagan era . Most people remember him only as a swaggering , stop-at-nothing attack virtuoso . All true , but he also understood the sustaining link between politics and culture . He read Dos Passos 's USA and BRIGHT LIGHTS , BIG CITY with equal interest , marking and underlining the parts he liked , clutching a Bic pen in his fist like a child with a crayon . He was obsessed with generational change , and saw that his fellow baby boomers would think and vote differently in the ' 90s . <p> I remember having lunch with him a year or so after he became chairman of the Republican National Committee , listening to him lay out his plan for changing the cop platform . Atwater saw the need for a post-Reagan synthesis of low taxes and more effective government . Rejecting " bigger as better " as " the old politics , " Atwater 's solution was " quality " government that would help more and intrude less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the GOP 's " fortress "  --  strong foreign policy and opposition to tax increases . This would keep the right happy . As a Southerner , Atwater was hung up on Civil War imagery . " As long as we hold the high ground , " he said , " we can maneuver on this other stuff . " <p> Lee 's first brain seizure was on March 5 , 1990 . Three months later , in an effort to open deficit reduction negotiations with Congress , Bush broke his no-new-taxes pledge , and agreed in advance to " tax revenue increases . " Giving to Democrats up front what they wanted was perhaps not the smartest negotiating strategy , but every tragic tale needs its fatal mistake . OMB director Richard Darman 's 1990 budget deal has two squadrons of defenders : partisan Democrats and editorial board good-government types . The enthusiasm of the former is understandable : as Napoleon said , never interfere with the enemy when he is in the process of destroying himself . But the goo-goos should know better , because the budget deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only its authors could love a plan that raised taxes , raised pork-barrel spending , froze everything else in place , raised the deficit , and prolonged the recession . <p> The 629-page Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act attempted to establish a new bureaucratic order , subsuming all federal activities for the next five years . It paralyzed politics , frustrating the activist left as well as the activist right . Intended as the apotheosis of Kennedy School technocracy , OBRA was a decadent orchid , a fleur de mal . Even policies continued on page 26 that did n't involve spending money , such as school choice and deregulation , were tangled up in its snakelike tendrils . The deal was so cryptologically complicated that Darman needed the continuous cooperation of congressional Democrats to keep the fragile creation alive . So while the budget chief spun the media , OMB enforcers worked with the Democrats to break the fingers of any Republican who had the temerity to suggest anything new . Even after the recession began , the deficit increased , and the Soviet Union collapsed , the administration line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late 1990 that Congress could just go home , that Bush would n't need it for anything . How could we fault people for thinking we did n't have a domestic policy when the White House chief of staff said that we should n't have one ? <p> As governor of New Hampshire , Sununu was an activist . My first exposure to him was while riding along in the back of a motorcade during the ' 88 New Hampshire primary campaign . Like every Granite State Republican , Sununu was a firm adherent to the no-income-tax " Pledge , " but I was startled to hear him talk about schools , mental hospitals , and homeless shelters he had built and reformed in his six years in the Concord Statehouse . He had an engineer 's sensibility  --  he enjoyed talking about problem-solving . ( And yes , his I.Q. is as high as they say : he really could multiply a six-digit number by six-digit number in his head . ) Sununu was a genius in search of another genius . He came to Washington and met Mr. Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could someone who hated taxes and loved activism come to embrace a pact that institutionalized the opposite ? Sununu reminded me of Colonel Nicholson in THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI . Alec Guiness 's maniacally self-righteous British officer becomes so consumed by his need to trump his Japanese captors that he slave-drives his men into building them a better bridge than they could have built for themselves . George Mitchell and Tom Foley must have relished the spectacle of Sununu and Darman laboring to build something that pleased only Democrats . <p> Darman 's elitism , control freakery , and fetish for deal-making evoked echoes of Henry Kissinger , another smart player obsessed with secrecy . But the joke was on him : Darman orchestrated a multivariate , gothically nuanced surrender when the Republicans were winning ! Bob Teeter once told me , " Jim Baker was smart enough to know that he needed a Dick Darman . But Darman was n't smart enough to know that he needed a Baker . " Meaning : Baker was n't threatened by whipsmart subordinates ; Darman lacked the character and judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's only one way to make a name for yourself , and that way is the way of the budget deal . <p> The only domestic Bushman to gain stature in the aftermath of the budget was Jack Kemp , the idealist who was convinced that he was doing what was right even as Darman 's noose was being slipped around his neck . Kemp was named chairman of the Economic Empowerment Task Force the same week Iraq invaded Kuwait . That bad luck aside , Kemp was still unable to elbow his agenda into Bush speeches and legislation . Like Reagan , Kemp disdained briefing books . He believed in the power of the illustrative anecdote . His idea of prepping his little crew of do-gooder nerds for a meeting with the president was to urge us to think up compelling tales of empowerment that would rouse the president out of what Kemp called " Social Darmanism . " In the meeting , Bush leaned back in his chair and chewed absently on the stem of his eyeglasses . <p> The last thing Darman wanted was another domestic superstar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world from the bottom up instead of the top down . Darman methodically expunged the word " empowerment " from the Bush lexicon  --  with no evident protest from Bush . Soon the Empowerment Task Force was removed from the West Wing 's prestigious Roosevelt Room and drop-kicked up to Room 476 in the Old Executive Office Building , down the hall from the Secret Service lounge . <p> Darman did n't much care for me either . A week after his speech lampooning the notion of a " new paradigm , " Darman showed up at a meeting of the " working group " of the Empowerment Task Force  --  one link above intern fire-safety briefings in the great chain of bureaucratic being . Callow jaws dropped as his booming voice blasted through our twittering . " It 's ridiculous to think of a ' new paradigm , ' " he said , rattling off his accomplishments in the Nixon-Ford years . I was smart enough to keep my mouth shut during his half-hour tirade , figuring that if I said anything in response , the meeting would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be chastised by my superiors for rumbling . <p> The Empowerment Task Force died a quiet little death during the self-congratulatory jubilee of Bush 's Desert Storm popularity . When Bush was at 90 percent popularity , he strode masterfully into a Capitol full of servile lawmakers and threw down the gauntlet : he would settle for nothing less than ... a transportation bill and a crime bill . Sununu and Darman were proud of this feat of pragmatic understatement . Their view was that if they did n't give Congress anything to do , there would n't be anything to screw up . The irony of the last four years is that Republican " pragmatism "  --  an ethos of bet-hedging , blame-shifting , and self-exculpation-turned out to be profoundly unpragmatic . <p> Peggy Noonan was one of the first to see that the downward trend of Bush 's poll ratings from their Schwarzkopfian apex might continue , even accelerate . Comparing Bush to Churchill in an October 1991 memo to Teeter , she wrote : " The Republicans too may be undone by their triumph . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your Taxes Down and Cut the Size of Government  --  and the past four years we have done neither . Really , there is no reason for them to vote for us now . " <p> Not long after , James Carville , using Harris Wofford as a decoy , defeated Dick Thornburgh in the contest for Pennsylvania 's Senate seat . Still , no domestic agenda emerged . Its absence became dramatically apparent after the Los Angeles riots . The predicted right-wing backlash never materialized . People worried instead that under Republicans , the country was falling apart . Coincidence had me in Los Angeles when the city was on fire . Holed up in my hotel room , I watched hour after hour of live coverage on every channel . It hit me : after thirty years of Great Society programs and twenty-five years of law and order , America had nothing . I thought of FDR 's Depression-era activism . Later I looked up the quote : " It is common sense to take a method and try it ; if it fails , admit it frankly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Sitting in an airport lounge , I watched T.V. as Rodney King pleaded for calm . That tore it . I called Teeter and First Son George W. Bush from a nearby pay phone . " The president needs to get on T.V. , and he needs to get out here , " I said . We were all thinking alike , but as Teeter reminded me , the White House did not have a bias for action . Pushing my luck , I ventured my own remedy : " There 's only one government institution that anyone has any confidence in , and that 's the one that we 're about to shrink : the military . Instead of laying off all these drill sergeants and shutting down all these bases , why not bring back the Civilian Conservation Corps ? " George Jr . bought the argument immediately . The next morning he called his father , and then called me back . The president was unenthusiastic : " Is n't this the sort of thing that we 're fighting against ? " <p> Back in D.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reminded my colleagues that we 're spending $250 billion a year fighting poverty now and not getting any credit for it . Fred Steeper of BQ ' 92 " Strategic Information " ( polling ) was a slave to his numbers . In the parlance , he was " data-driven . " He said that out of a list of possible initiatives , from building an anti-immigration wall across the U.S.-Mexico border to national health insurance , the CCC idea polled No. 1 . Brandishing his cross-tabs , I barnstormed around the headquarters , interrupting phone calls and crashing meetings : " If we could just get Bush to some military base to visit a few hundred former Crips and Bloods , now wearing green T-shirts , doing something productive , that would be worth more politically than adding another zero to the dollar total of our urban aid package . " <p> Darman , who reached the pinnacle of his power during the brief Sam Skinner interregnum ( the nine months , after Sununu was fired , that Skinner kept Baker 's West Wing chair warm ) , dismissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fred Malek called Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to pitch the idea in my presence . Malek did n't get through . Later I heard back that the Pentagon did n't like it . Of course the generals did n't like it . They were too busy preparing for the Big One . Over the next few weeks , my COG ranting pretty much ended my effectiveness at the Bush campaign . People got tired of hearing me sputter : " We have to have a plan . This is my plan . If you hate my plan , fine . But what 's YOUR plan ? " <p> There was no plan  --  except to throw the kitchen sink at Clinton . The campaign , addled by the seductions of Beltway empire-building , actually attacked the Democrats for proposing to cut 100,000 bureaucrats from the federal payroll . Losing sight of the widening public-sector chasm between tax inputs and policy outcomes , we bashed Clinton for not spending enough on Arkansas 's children . We were so busy trafficking in trivia that we let Clinton 's eighteen-wheeler of proposed tax and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush broke New Paradigm hearts . But it was in his administration that some N.P. ideas got a tryout . I have never been so proud to be a Republican as I was when I represented his campaign to the National Association of Resident Management Corporations last September . I sat with public housing empowerer Kimi Gray , listening to narratives of struggle against the bureaucratic overseers of the Great Society . The upwardly mobile poor of NARMC are almost all Democrats , but they love Kemp : he would have easily defeated Clinton in a voice vote . The people opposing resident empowerment initiatives , the public housing bosses , are Democrats too . They hated Kemp for what he was trying to do . All of them voted for Bill Clinton , and all of them will want something in return for their Support . Clinton will be confronted with a long and agonizing battle between new ideas and an old coalition . He must now prove that " a different kind of Democrat " is more than just a way of saying , " I can win . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a threat to Clinton , because Darmanism robbed us of our credibility as compassionate and thoughtful stewards of the public trust . As Kemp says , " People do n't care that you know until they know that you care . " But what if we changed ? Having seen their old gods fail them in 1992 , salvation-minded GOPers are certain to seek political redemption in new ideas . Smart Republicans recognize that the end of the cold war means that it is time to come home to our Lincolnian roots as the party of activist domestic reform . We reason that the Real Majority cares about a centrist cluster of core goals : economic growth , as well as education , health care , and the overall quality of life . New Paradigm Republicans and New Paradigm Democrats agree on the same goals  --  thus the only thing left to argue about is technique . <p> In a changing world , it 's hard to argue against change . " Nothing lasts forever , " said Willy Brandt on his deathbed . " Every era demands its own answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be prepared for them . " Americans are an optimistic , practical-minded people . They will choose whichever party builds a better political mousetrap . For these reasons , we are not " swallow 'd up in endless misery .
