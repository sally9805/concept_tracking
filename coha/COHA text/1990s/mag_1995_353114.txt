" If you were n't depressed you 'd be an idiot , " one character tells another in Woody Allen 's one-acter , Central Park West . The words might equally sum up either of the other two short plays , An Interview and Hotline , that opened off-Broadway last week under the collective title Death Defying Acts . All three offer humor of bile and bite . <P> David Mamet 's cryptic , Kafkaesque An Interview takes place between the Attorney ( Paul Guilfoyle ) and the Attendant ( Gerry Becker ) . Theirs is an encounter between a terrier and a sphinx : lots of barking on one side , stony silence on the other . The Attorney has apparently been summoned to defend his life , and as his exasperation rises , Guilfoyle displays a wonderfully mobile range of faces : puzzlement , gloating self-assertion , crumpled resignation . If An Interview finally seems like a one-joke drama , it 's dexterous enough to dispense a little wallop of spooky uneasiness . <P> Elaine May 's Hotline is brief too , but with all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrays a despairing prostitute who phones a suicide-prevention center , where she reaches an overconfident staff member ( played , again deftly , by Becker ) . May places considerable demands on her actors . For one thing , she asks the drama to drag , literally : after swallowing handfuls of pills , Lavin crawls around her apartment , moaning wisecracks . For another , May has contrived a tale that , in a compressed space , moves from squalor to redemption . That the ending works as well as it does suggests that there 's a better play here , potentially , than the one we have . <P> When the curtain rises on Central Park West , we realize we 're back in Allenland  --  that ingenious , engaging and occasionally claustrophobic terrain . We know the props : shrink jokes , sexual put-downs , etc . Debra Monk is Phyllis , a psychotherapist who , having discovered that her husband Sam ( Guilfoyle ) is unfaithful , seeks solace from her friend Carol ( Lavin ) . Or so it seems . Turns out that Phyllis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Carol her husband has been sleeping with . Carol counters by announcing that she and Sam , desperately in love , will be moving to London . Or so it seems . <P> The play has all the clever twists we look for in a romantic farce . Yet in its bitterness and scorching profanity , it is miles from the lightheartedness of traditional farce . It 's an unsteady , if engrossing , marriage of the light and bubbly and the down and dirty . One result is that its implausibilities nag us as they would n't in pure farce , where nobody asks that things stay plausible so long as they remain entertaining . <P> In all three plays , what 's good is quite good , and what is n't is at least adroit and intelligent . And if you leave the theater with conflicted emotions , that 's only to be expected . Mixed feelings are , after all , what Death Defying Acts aspires to : troubled laughter .                 @ @ @ @
