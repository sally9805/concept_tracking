HEADQUARTERED IN A SPRAWLING , 1950s-era complex just outside Beijing , the Shougang steel company is a symbol of China 's economic prowess  --  and its problems . Earlier this year , when credit was easy and the economy was steaming ahead at a 17% annual clip , the state-owned conglomerate and its 270,000 employees could hardly keep pace with consumer demand . Profits soared . Then came the credit crunch orchestrated by economic czar Zhu Rongji , and Shougang felt the sting at once . Customers slashed their orders , and soon Shougang could not pay its bills . The company last month was forced to take out a $70 million loan from the government to keep operating . <P> The fate of Shougang and other state-owned behemoths was much on the mind of China 's rulers last week , as they launched a de facto turnaround in Vice Premier Zhu 's austerity measures , coupled with a bid to broaden and deepen medium-term economic reforms . A communique issued by the party 's central committee indicated that the government was loosening the restraints on credit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement also made a significant nod to the importance of the market as " a fundamental factor in the disposition of resources . " And it went on to endorse speedy reforms in taxation , banking and investment to provide a more sophisticated financial system for the nurturing of sustained growth . But those reforms will take time to bite . In the short term , it was far from clear how Beijing could control a renewed torrid growth rate without setting off a new round of inflation and speculation . <P> &; The 10-point central-committee blueprint outlined the basic themes of reform but was vague on key details . A new system of taxation will require the 30 provinces to pay more to the central government , which collects only about 13% of all taxes paid in a chaotic system rife with inequities . Credit will be somewhat restrained when commercial banks are freed of various obligations to support money-losing state enterprises , but that will be some time coming . Finally , privatization of state-owned companies was acknowledged as a distant prospect  --  though the communique made it clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainstay " of the economy . Says a Chinese economist : " They 're making the blueprint now , but we 're going to call 1994 the year of economic reforms . " <P> The stop-go cycle of austerity and relaxation results from a paradox . China 's reformist economy " suffers not from too much central control but too little , " notes Richard Margolis , an executive at the Smith New Court Far East investment firm in Hong Kong . Much of the country 's inflation last year , for example , resulted from Beijing 's malnourishment by the primitive taxation system . With more than 80% of all tax revenues left in provincial coffers , the central government simply printed more money to finance its major infrastructure undertakings . At the same time , provincial authorities launched an orgy of speculative development projects that took money away from such essential functions as paying peasants for their crops . As prices soared , unrest in the countryside quickened , until Zhu stepped in last summer .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
