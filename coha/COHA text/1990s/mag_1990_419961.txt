Section : Society <p> A startling rise in sex crimes and the notoriety of cases like the Central Park jogger give new urgency to the question : why do men rape ? <p> They say a lot of things lead up to rape , but I never thought about it . I do n't know what the hell I was looking for . The opportunity occurred and I just took advantage of it . <p> Convicted rapist Roger Smith , 26 , interviewed in Atlanta 's Metro Correctional Institution . <p> Why do they do it ? What impels men to commit , sometimes casually , sometimes with practiced cunning , one of the most primitively brutal of crimes  --  the pre-empting of another person 's body for the gratification of their own needs ? Data to help solve that frightening riddle is in short supply . Most of it comes from rapists who are caught and convicted , representing only a slice of the real total . Meanwhile , disturbing new statistics are emerging on the sheer incidence of sex crimes . The recent Senate Judiciary Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased four times as fast as the overall crime rate over the last decade . A woman is raped every six minutes , the committee said , but only half the rapes are ever reported . The new statistics , along with the notoriety surrounding events like the Central Park jogger trial currently unfolding in grisly detail in Manhattan , are giving new urgency to the quest to understand the phenomenon of sexual violence . <p> No single profile provides an answer to why men rape . Opportunity , emotional illness , lust  --  it happens for all of those reasons , yet often for none of them . There is Roger Smith , a married mechanic oppressed by mortgage payments on his trailer home , stopping to do a good deed for a woman whose car had broken down and tarrying , unexpectedly , to assault her . But there is also " Bill , " a serial rapist who methodically sought out his victims in their own apartments , attacking seven women at knifepoint before he was caught . Some are like " Vince , " a sexually troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teens , committed a rape murder in his early 20s , and then went to prison for molesting his own stepdaughter . Others are like " James , " a 42-year-old Miami business manager with four children , aware only of a vague " frustration " in his life , who liked to pick up females in pairs and rape one of them in front of the other . " Inside is a rage , " said James , who completed a sexual-offender program in June 1989 , after serving 10 years for rape . <p> Anger , deep and dark , is a common thread among rapists . Something has invariably gone wrong with their lives , often from almost the very beginning . A 1982 study of rapists in Oregon found that as many as 80 percent were abused children , and their own victimization results in a kind of emotional death . They grow up feeling martyred , self justifying  --  unwilling or unable to extend compassion to the people they in turn abuse . Many depersonalize their victims . " The offender views rape the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Vermont Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Sexual Abuse . Yet others are so shamed by their acts they grow suicidal . William Samek , a Miami-based clinical psychologist , remembers one extreme instance in which the rapist handed his gun to his woman victim , exclaiming : " I ca n't stand it anymore , please blow me away . " <p> Tough laws : The inability to make useful generalizations about rapists has fostered a somewhat schizoid attitude about how to treat them . " They 're not all mad dogs , " says Pithers . " Rape is a sick act committed by sane people . " That poses a conundrum to police and mental-health authorities , who sometimes split between favoring imprisonment without treatment and treatment without imprisonment . Typically , Washington state has one of the country 's more innovative programs for sex offenders  --  and also the toughest pack of laws to keep released offenders under police and public surveillance . <p> Inevitably , the quarrel evokes shades of the ancient nature versus nurture argument . Some treatment experts , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings about impotence , and is thus sometimes labeled " medical castration . " They feel rapists suffer from a biological defect , and ca n't be cured , only controlled . ( Some still advocate literal castration . ) Others argue that potency is not the problem , since many rapists are unable to penetrate their victims or achieve orgasm when they rape . " We believe that what 's wrong with a sex offender is what 's between his ears , not his legs , " says Richard Seely , director of Minnesota 's Intensive Treatment Program for Sexual Aggressiveness , who refuses to use the suppressant drug . " It 's his thinking that 's dysfunctional , not his sexuality , " he says . " Rapists are who they learn to be-it 's not a product of their hormones . " <p> Experts have hotly debated for years whether rape is an act of violence van act of sex . Current thinking seems to be that it is both , but there are still differences of emphasis . " We look at rape as the sexual expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexuality , " says psychologist Nicholas Groth , director of Forerisic Mental Health Associates , who has seen more than 3,000 sex offenders in 25 years of practice . Most of his patients , Groth points out , were not sexually deprived at the time they committed rape . <p> Three types : About 10 years ago , Groth established a typology of rapists that is still a standard , although some psychologists feel parts of it are outdated . Broadly speaking , rapists fall into three motivational types , said Groth : anger , power and sadism . In anger assaults , the rapist is getting even for " some wrong he feels has been done to him , by life , by his victim at the time . He 's in a frame of rage and attacks someone sexually . " The anger rape is usually unpremeditated and impulsive , but the impulse drives the rapist into excessive force : the victim is punched , choked , kicked into submission . Most such offenders derive little pleasure from the act , says Groth , but " they want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty , the worst thing you could do to someone . That reflects a lot of our values in society . " <p> Anger rapists can be the most ruthless . " Forrest , " 33 , went to see a friend once , and found he had moved . When the woman living in the house invited him in to use the phone , he grabbed her and her then 86-year-old mother-in-law , pushed them into the bedroom , tore their clothes offend penetrated the older woman with his finger . Then he panicked and fled . " Rape was always a big issue for me , " says Forrest , who was caught soon after the attack and has been in prison for five years . The father of three children , addicted to drugs and drink , he had been thrown out by his wife after beating her repeatedly . Often , he says , he had rape fantasies about his mother , who had beaten him " nonstop since the age of 8 . " Forrest has joined the sex-offender treatment program at Washington 's Twin Rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Power rape , Groth says , is a form of compensation , committed usually by men who feel unsure of their competence . Rape gives them a sense of mastery and control . Power rapists usually hunt for a victim , or seize an opportunity : finding a young girl in the house after a break-in , for example . " Tom , " 37 , an abuser of alcohol and drugs , was forced as a child to perform oral sex on his grandfather and had a history of window peeping , flashing , compulsive masturbation and making obscene phone calls by the time he committed his first rape , at 20 . He admits to about a dozen sexual assaults since then , although he was caught only twice . He recalls feeling nothing for his victims . " There were only thoughts of me . I 'd say , ' I have a knife , and I 'll cut your eye out ' . " Once he smashed a woman 's face into a car because she kicked him in the groin . But often " there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after serving his first prison term for rape , " Tom " kidnapped a woman at a parking ramp , and forced her to perform oral sex on him three times . Now serving nine years at a maximum security facility in Minnesota , he has gained enough insight from counselors to say , " A lot of what I did had to do with my own feelings of inadequacy . " But he is also perceptive enough to add : " I ca n't say I 'll never rape again . " <p> Groth defines his third type , sadistic rape , as eroticized aggression . The very act of forcible sex excites rapists in ways that consensual sex ca n't . " If the anger components of aggression are eroticized , " he explains , " then you see sadistic acts , such as deliberate sexual torture , using an instrument to rape the victim . " Something like that may have incited a group of Glen Ridge , N.J. , high-school football teammates in March 1989 , when they allegedly sexually assaulted a mentally impaired woman with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A sadistic impulse may be the only explanation for such a horror . But gang rapes have a dynamic of their own . Alone , the participants may be incapable of sexual assault ; together , they may bait each other into monstrous acts , as police contend the Glen Ridge footballers and the Central Park jogger 's attackers did . They tend to be more opportunistic than ordinary marauders . " A lot of times you may have one or more individuals in the group who have the same arousal patterns as a rapist , " says psychologist Gerald Kaplan , executive director of Alpha Human Services in Minneapolis , a community-based sex-offender program . " But the typical gang rape is not like having a whole pack of rapists . In fact , most rapists are isolated people who travel by themselves . It 's a very hidden part of their lives . " <p> Gang rapers are usually quite young , and vulnerable to peer pressure : they play follow the leader . The rape is a rite of passage , and the unwilling rapist may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moreover , often builds to extreme violence , as members are challenged to outdo each other . Some studies suggest that offenders slow down as they age . Older men simply do n't travel in packs . " You 're not going to find a group of 40-year-old rapists out there as a group , " says Kaplan . <p> One of the most consistent elements in rape of all kinds is the absence of empathy ; attackers are able to persuade themselves that the victim wanted or deserved to be raped . Dr. Gene Abel , a professor of psychiatry at Emory University who has studied hundreds of rapists over the past 20 years , believes that rapists suffer from a form of cognitive distortion that allows them to justify their actions in the face of stark evidence to the contrary . Abel recently saw a patient who claimed he had never raped a woman , despite an arrest record showing repeated rape charges . When he asked the I i patient how he would know a woman wanted to have sex with him , he replied that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up to her apartment . How would he know if she were n't willing , Abel asked . The patient responded , seeing nothing askew in his answer : " If she fought me the whole time we were having sex . " <p> Probably these distortions set in early , as a child protects himself from unbearable reality . Only 10 percent of rapists appear to have a history of psychiatric illness . But by the time they are ordered into treatment , their careers may be well advanced ; some list hundreds of victims as they pour out their stories . Few rapists ever seek treatment on their own , says Theoharis Seghorn , a clinical psychologist at New England Forensic Associates : " Rapists do n't reach out because they do n't trust . " <p> Keep out : Treatment may not be able to cure rapists , but the majority can be helped . Most programs aim to get patients to stop rationalizing and accept responsibility . The rapists may not be able to feel actual empathy , but counselors urge them to behave as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison . " For many of them , it has to be on the level of their own self-interest , " says Stephen Huot , an associate director at the Minnesota Correctional Facility in Oak Park Heights . <p> Oak Park teaches inmates to acknowledge blame by sharing written autobiographies in group therapy . After identifying their patterns of assault , they work on conscience-building by putting themselves in the victims ' shoes . Occasionally they even write letters to their victims . They also learn to change their fantasies and distorted thinking . At the Vermont center , newcomers invariably say they were drunk when they raped . Long-termers tell them : " We 'll respect you a lot more around here if you cut out that bullshit . " To help such people discover empathy is a complicated job , says director Pithers . " They need to experience their own feelings before they can identify with others . " The offenders start by writing down every emotion they can remember feeling . One 16-year-old , in after committing his fifth rape , could name only four : depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them films like " To Kill a Mockingbird " or " A Christmas Story , " a simple ' 40s tale about a boy who wants a rifle for Christmas , and has the offenders try to identify the emotions of all the characters , noting those that were n't acceptable in their own families . He has them read victims ' recollections or watch videotapes of their victims ' testimony , and jot down when they recognize how one of the victims might have felt . For most people who can feel for others almost as naturally as they breathe , it may be hard to imagine not feeling . But many young offenders are " numbed out , " says Lynn Reynolds , clinical director of the Institute Against Social Violence , in Briarcliff Manor , N.Y . " I had one boy who saw his father pull his mother down the steps by her hair and stab her , " says Reynolds . " That 's not an excuse , but it does explain his desensitization to violence . " Adds Eugene Porter , an Oakland , Calif. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who did n't have a childhood horror story . " <p> Some programs still employ behavior modification techniques , such as administering mild shocks while inmates view pornographic material , or " masturbatory reconditioning "  --  getting them to masturbate to " healthy " images . Some men never do develop the connection to others that allows them to care . With many , impulsiveness and sexual arousal are the main issues , and thus they need both punishment and treatment , says Porter . " Punishment drives home the point , it serves to correct the ' responsibility imbalance ' . " In recent years the burden of treatment has shifted from mental-health departments to corrections departments , an issue bitterly debated in some states . <p> The public , for its part , generally opposes money for treating rapists . Funding tends to increase only after widely publicized assaults . After a series of rape-murders in Minnesota a few years ago , the legislature increased both sentences and treatment dollars for rapists , notes Huot . Now , sexual offenders may wait a year to get into treatmeet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a year of chemical dependency treatment . <p> Meanwhile , mental-health and corrections officials across the country are seeing an ever more youthful population of sex offenders , some  --  both abused and abusing  --  as young as 8 . According to the National Center for Juvenile Justice , the arrest rate for 13- and 14-year-olds accused of rape doubled between 1976 and 1986 . Although experts agree that younger offenders respond better to treatment , they often fall between the cracks of the social-welfare system . " Every state is trying to figure out what to do with these kids , " says June Binney , of the Department of Mental Health in Massachusetts . <p> Macho stud : Teenagers are not the only group contributing to the rise in sex offenses . Part of the jump is due to a staggering increase in reported " date " or acquaintance rape . An estimated 75 percent of rapes occur between people who know each other . " Men may well mistake sexual liberation for license , " says Eleanor Holmes Norton , a lawyer and activist on women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the escalating violence in popular culture for fueling the growth in rape statistics across the board . After two decades of the newly " sensitive , " nurturing male , the macho stud seems to have come back in magnum force . In sexually explicit movies and books , as well as increasingly suggestive music videos and television shows , men flex pectorals and women acrobatically surrender to them . " Our insensitivity to the violence of rape is undoubtedly fostered by our massive diet of entertainment , " says Dr. Thomas Radecki , research director for the National Coalition on Television Violence , based in Champaign , Ill . <p> Radecki cites statistics showing one out of eight Hollywood movies depicts a rape theme ; and by age 18 , the average American will have seen 250,000 acts of violence and 40,000 attempted murders on television . Radecki 's position with a special-interest group may make such figures a little suspect , and in light of the recent wave of reaction against funding sexually explicit art , critics should be wary of encouraging censorship . But neither a Radecki nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something has run amok in the culture . <p> H. Rap Brown once raised middle-class hackles by declaring that violence " is as American as cherry pie . " Examinirg our national rape statistics , the Senate Judiciary Committee noted that when ranked against other nations , the United States leads the way , with a rape rate four times that of Germany , 13 times as much as England , 20 times as much as Japan . Sadly , sexual violence , too , may now be an emblem of the American way . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Sane People Sick at Act , No single profile fits all rapists . There is Roger Smith ( top ) , a married man oppressed by unpaid bills , or Vincent Lipscomb ( bottom ) , convicted of raping a University of Illinois coed .

Some studies have shown that men exposed to sadistic pornography become inured to the horror .
