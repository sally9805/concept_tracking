Until last spring , you probably did give the complex financial instruments known as derivatives much thought . And if you did , you likely assumed they affected only high risk hedge funds and other sophisticated types of investing . But when rising interest rates sparked wholesale carnage in the derivatives markets this spring , small investors learned otherwise . Derivatives turned up in bond mutual funds that had been marketed to individuals . Some of those funds fell as much as 15% more than similar ones that avoided these toxic substances . What 's more , derivatives popped up even in such seemingly safe investments as money funds and a cash account in a 401(k) retirement savings plan . Roughly a dozen money-market funds , including $3.6 billion Pacific Horizon Prime Fund and $102 million Zweig Cash Fund , were bushwhacked by derivatives-related losses . In May , oil giant Arco announced $22 million in losses in its $400 million Money Market Plus Fund , a cash-equivalent fund that is one of the four investment options in the company 's 401(k) plan . So far , investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; fund and plan managers have said they will dig into their own pockets for cash to cover the losses and keep the funds ' net asset value from falling below the $1-per-share standard . But bond fund holders have been bloodied . In June , under threat of two class-action lawsuits , Paine Webber announced it would funnel $33 million into its $1 billion Short-Term U.S. Government Income Fund and spend another $55 million to buy back the riskiest derivatives in its portfolio . Even with the payback , holders of Class A shares in the fund , which had been pitched as a safe alternative to CDs , were stuck with a total return of minus 6.32% from Jan. 1 through June 24 , 1994 , far below the 1.6% loss posted by the average short-term government bond fund . Derivatives are financial products whose value is based on , or " derived from , " yet another financial product or benchmark , such as long-term interest rates or a commodity price index . Examples include collateralize mortgage obligations , which are created by slicing up pools of government-backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value as interest rates decline ; and structured notes , customized bets designed to meet a fund 's particular investment objectives . These complex instruments can create two hazards for investors . First , some are highly leveraged , which means a 1% interest-rate hike could saddle you with a loss of 10% or more . Second , many are relatively illiquid . Because they do n't trade regularly like stock and bonds , they can be hard to price and nearly impossible to sell in times of trouble . " Derivatives are good in good markets and awful in bad markets , " says Standard &; Poor 's managing director , Sanford Bragg . " When problems arise , liquidity dries up . " In October , more than a quarter of the 1,728 long-term mutual funds surveyed by the Investment Company Institute , a trade group , reported that they held derivatives ; fixed-income and balanced funds were most likely to employ them . As for company-sponsored 401(k) retirement savings plans , " I 'd say a good half are using derivatives , " says J. Michael Scarborough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which manages money for 401(k) investors . Spooked by recent losses , some fund managers may be rethinking their investment policies . " I 've heard some fund companies say they are going to curtail the use of derivatives , " says Edward Jones , a partner with the accounting firm KPMG/Peat Marwick . " They say the markets are too volatile , and some are n't sure they fully understand them . " Does this retreat mean you can rest easy ? No way . While most of the damage from the recent upturn in interest rates is done , some funds may post additional losses when they try to unload the harder-to-sell derivatives still locked away in the basements of their portfolios  --  and find there are n't any buyers . Sharp new swings in interest rates , commodity prices or other indexes could also trigger a fresh set of disasters . Securities and Exchange Commission officials , for instance , say they would not be surprised to see a money-market fund allow its share to trade below a buck . Finding out if your fund or plan owns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain boilerplate language permitting the use of options and forwards , the two basic types of derivatives . But even a close reading of your fund 's annual report is n't likely to give you a clear picture of whether the fund actually holds such derivatives or how risky they are . Not all derivatives are potential time bombs , though . Some can be used to limit risk . A fund may purchase stock index futures  --  basically the right to buy or sell a basket of securities at a set price on a future date  --  because that 's easier and cheaper than owning each individual stock outright . Others buy currency futures with the sensible aim of reducing the odds that shifting exchange rates will torpedo the value of their foreign holdings . Moreover , even the riskier , more complex types of derivatives have their virtues  --  in admittedly aggressive funds , for example . The big problems arise when funds sold as low or moderate risk load up on derivatives to give their returns a high-octane boost  --  without warning investors of the possible downside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sort of speculation . SEC chairman Arthur Levitt has warned fund companies to be cautious with derivatives . Last June the SEC pressed money-market fund managers to move to dispose of the most dangerous derivatives among their holdings . The SEC is also trying to address the liquidity problem by urging the securities industry to set up a central clearinghouse where derivatives would trade . For the time being , however , it 's up to you to watch out for potential land mines . One red flag : Your money-market fund is yielding a quarter of a percentage point more than competitors or your bond fund is yielding one percentage point more than funds holding similar bonds  --  and low expenses do n't explain the difference . To better assess the potential risks in a fund or retirement plan , call your fund 's toll-free 800 number , the financial adviser that sold you the fund , or your company 's benefits department and ask the following questions : What percentage of my fund 's assets are exposed to structured notes , floaters , STRIPS and other exotic derivatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its assets in these derivatives , you should be skeptical , " says John Rekenthaler , editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds . " It 's hard to figure out why you should own it . " Even investors with a taste for risk would be wise to avoid a fund that has more than 10% of its assets in these derivatives . And money-market investors ought to avoid funds with any complex derivatives . What portion of the derivatives in my fund are priced by fund Management and not by outside pricing services ? Fund companies are supposed to value all the securities in their portfolios  --  including derivatives  --  on a daily basis ( although this does n't always happen , as Fidelity 's recent one-day computer failure showed ) . Normally , a fund manager should be able to get prices from at least two outside firms . But some derivatives trade so rarely that the fund must price them itself using a combination of guesswork and intricate computer models . These are often the very instruments hardest to sell in a down market . " If a fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem , " says Richard Davis , a managing director with J.P . Morgan Investments . What impact would a 1% increase or a 1% decrease in interest rates have on my fund ? Merely knowing what your fund returns today is n't enough . You need to find out whether the use of derivatives has made it especially sensitive to interest-rate fluctuations , how much money you could lose and whether your fund is more vulnerable to rising or falling rates . Why is my fund using derivatives , and can it achieve the same goals through simpler means ? If your fund ca n't achieve its objectives without derivatives , that could be a sign it 's taking big risks . Some funds  --  including many of the money-market funds that recently ran into trouble  --  have used derivatives to circumvent restrictions limiting the maturity of the securities they own . If yours is doing this you may want to find another investment or , at the least , ask management what can go wrong with its strategy . Even if your fund has a hard time answering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be sending an important message : that investors want clear information about how funds use derivatives  --  and you in particular wo n't take kindly to any nasty surprises . <p>
