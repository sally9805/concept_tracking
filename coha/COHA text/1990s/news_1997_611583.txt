<p> NBC sportscaster Marv Albert put an end to his lurid sexual assault trial but lost his job when he pleaded guilty yesterday to assault and battery for biting a 42-year-old Vienna woman , accepting a plea bargain in which prosecutors dropped a more serious charge of forcible sodomy . <p> Albert , who also resigned from his sportscasting job with the cable network that airs New York Knicks basketball games , faces up to 12 months in jail and a $ 2,500 fine when he is sentenced Oct. 24 . Under the forcible sodomy charge , a felony , he could have been sentenced to a maximum term of life in prison . <p> The early afternoon deal came after two days of graphic testimony about oral sex , biting and sexual threesomes , and more than three hours of closed negotiations under the watchful eye of the presiding judge . The deal also came after courtroom surprises from both sides that jurors said yesterday had cast serious doubt on the credibility of both Albert , 56 , and the victim . <p> At the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benjamin N.A. Kendrick . " Are you pleading guilty because you are in fact guilty of this crime ? " the judge asked . " Yes , " Albert said , after looking at his attorney . <p> The plea came less than 24 hours after the prosecution produced a second woman who said Albert had bitten her and tried to force her to perform oral sex . <p> " I felt I had to end this ordeal for myself and my wonderful family and my fiancee , " Albert said in a brief statement . <p> The victim 's attorney , George DePolo , said in a statement that his client " believes the disposition of this matter is an appropriate one and as a result she feels vindicated . " The Washington Post does not identify accusers in criminal sex assault cases . <p> Four jurors interviewed yesterday said the case still was very much up in the air . Three of them were undecided , and the fourth leaned toward acquittal . <p> " I do n't think that it should have come to trial at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who said he had n't made up his mind about the case . " We were told by the judge at the end that he was offered this plea bargain before , and he should have taken it before . " <p> Albert 's lead attorney , Roy Black , said he advised the deal because Kendrick had ruled he could not use much of the information his investigators unearthed about the victim , including a charge  --  eventually dismissed  --  that she had threatened an ex-boyfriend in Washington by telephone . " Approximately 85 to 90 percent of our defense has been excluded . It makes it hard to move ahead , " Black said . <p> For Commonwealth 's Attorney Richard E. Trodden , the bargain came after the defense had seriously damaged the victim 's credibility with an audiotape in which she appeared to be offering a witness money to corroborate her story . " Assault and battery is an unlawful touching done in an angry , rude or vengeful manner . We think it is appropriate that Mr. Albert pleaded guilty to that charge , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been NBA play-by-play announcer since 1977 , the plea after days of testimony about his fondness for women 's underwear , threesomes and oral sex was apparently just too much . <p> " This past May , when charges against Marv Albert became public , Mr. Albert asserted his innocence and assured NBC 's senior management that there was no basis whatsoever to the charges , " NBC said in a statement . " Today , given Mr. Albert 's plea of guilty to assault and battery , NBC terminates its relationship with Marv Albert . " <p> Many legal observers and groups that work with sexual assault victims said they viewed the plea bargain as a partial victory for the prosecution . Even with the testimony of the second woman , a conviction on either charge was by no means a sure thing , they said , and the plea also eliminates the very real possibility that Kendrick 's decisions on excluding evidence could have been reversed on appeal . <p> " It represents a victory for women because it demonstrates that even in a consensual relationship , violence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive director of the Women 's Center in Vienna . " It 's better than not guilty . " <p> Jurors and lawyers said the prosecution 's case clearly was damaged by a tape recording of a telephone conversation during which Albert 's accuser told cabdriver Walter Brodie they needed to get his information " tight " and apparently agreed to give him $ 50,000 and a new car . <p> " The whole ' Let 's get tight on this , ' for me , raised more questions , made her less credible to me , " said juror Kerri Nelson , 27 , a special education counselor , who was leaning toward acquittal . <p> For his part , Albert can say he was not convicted of a sex crime . He may not have to serve any jail time at all , and he no longer has to worry that prosecutors will further damage his image with more surprise witnesses . <p> The deal also releases him from Virginia 's tradition of having juries do the sentencing . Sentences often are longer after jury trials because juries  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time and judges are reluctant to tinker with a jury 's recommendation . <p> But it was the timing of the plea that had many lawyers scratching their heads yesterday . <p> Why did Albert 's attorneys ever allow this case to hit the headlines and reach the trial phase ? legal observers asked . If he was willing to plead guilty to assault , why did n't he do so well before the public knew anything about his alleged predilection for women 's underwear ? <p> Some local lawyers and legal scholars suggested that Albert went to court because his lead attorney , Roy Black , is an inveterate litigator who prefers to try cases aggressively rather than quietly settle them . <p> But Albert might not have had many options , according to local lawyers and legal scholars . He maintained all along that he was unaware of his legal troubles until after charges had been filed . Had he known he was on the verge of being indicted , Albert could have authorized his attorneys to approach his accuser and offer her a generous cash payment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13-year-old boy accused pop star Michael Jackson of molesting him in 1993 , the entertainer 's attorneys eventually were able to cut a deal . <p> Nor was it possible to cut a deal after forcible sodomy charges were filed , according to area lawyers . Under Virginia law , people accused of assault may make financial restitution with the approval of prosecutors rather than go to trial , but not under more serious charges . <p> " Prosecutors have veto power , but if they approve , a deal can be struck , " said former Arlington commonwealth 's attorney Henry Hudson . <p> So if Albert really did n't know he was about to be indicted , he did n't realize he needed to deal when the window of opportunity was open . After charges were filed , a deal was n't possible . <p> Prosecutors said yesterday that they had offered Albert the chance to plead guilty to assault before trial , before much of the most personally damaging testimony . Why did n't Albert 's attorneys leap at the chance ? <p> Black undoubtedly thought that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to court rather than dealing served his interests as well . After all , trying the case afforded Black the chance to play the cabdriver tape , the kind of Perry Mason moment that makes headlines and brings in more clients . <p> " I do n't think that Black misled Albert by going to court , but he 's a trial lawyer and his inclination is to fight , " said Bernard Grimm , a D.C. defense lawyer . <p> Black and his team also may have underestimated the prosecution 's case , lawyers said . Although Black cited Kendrick 's evidence decisions as the basis for the plea , most of those rulings were made before opening statements . <p> Black said in an interview on CNN television last night that the Albert team had no advance knowledge about Patricia Masden or about what sources said was at least one other witness who was prepared to testify about Albert 's sex life . <p> Trodden was not legally required to tell Albert 's team about Masden  --  who testified about two encounters with Albert  --  and apparently he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he had been for other prosecution witnesses  --  he did not have his usual manila folder of information on her , and some of his questions led to answers that made her sound more credible , not less . <p> Jurors said they were less impressed by Masden 's testimony than perhaps the defense thought they were . <p> " I was n't even sure that she was a credible witness , " Nelson said . " She called the prosecutors really late and maybe she was trying to get her 15 minutes
