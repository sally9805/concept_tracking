When Julianne Moore picks up a screenplay , she does n't read it so much as listen to it . " If I can hear it rhythmically or hear the voices in my mind , then I feel like I can do the script . If I ca n't hear it , I ca n't do it . " And , she adds , no re-reading is likely to alter this first , " instinctual " response . <P> This reliance on her ear is an oddity in a time when most actors , choosing a role , depend on that anatomically ( and emotionally ) imprecise region that lies somewhere between a hungry gut and a yawning ego . But it has kept Moore busy ( 21 features since 1992 ) and won her an Oscar nomination ( for Boogie Nights ) and the respectful regard of directors ranging from Steven Spielberg ( The Lost World ) to Robert Altman ( Short Cuts ) , if not yet the kind of stardom that can carry a picture . <P> That could be about to change . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she puts it , " I got to carry the main part of the story . " This is in writer-director Neil Jordan 's faithful , curiously compelling adaptation of Graham Greene 's novel The End of the Affair . <P> Moore plays Sarah Miles , the wife of an unutterably dull civil servant ( Stephen Rea ) who enters into a dalliance with an intense , emotionally greedy novelist named Maurice Bendrix ( a fiercely glowering Ralph Fiennes ) . Set in wartime London and the grayish postwar years , it is , to borrow Greene 's favorite word , a routinely " seedy " coupling . Until the afternoon when , taking a break from their lovemaking , Maurice steps out of the room and a buzz bomb strikes . She thinks he 's dead , drops to her knees and prays : if God will spare him , she will give him up . Whereupon Maurice returns to the bedroom , stunned but intact . <P> Sarah makes good on her promise . And Greene makes good on the theme that dominated his best work : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maurice , of course , is outraged by Sarah 's disappearance  --  and sets a private detective on her . He 's looking for an earthly explanation  --  a rival lover  --  not an unearthly one , for Sarah 's defection . For her part , Sarah remains unsure what has happened to her . Was her prayer answered ? Or was Maurice merely knocked out by the explosion ? <P> This is the point at which greatness enters Moore 's performance . Sarah will die  --  of tuberculosis  --  in this state of uncertainty , but with both her husband and her former lover attending her deathbed  --  touched , perhaps , by some dim , unspoken understanding of Sarah 's acceptance that grace has befallen her . The final irony is that it is the worldly Maurice who will be given the last piece of the puzzle , near-irrefutable evidence of her saintliness . <P> One suspects he 'll do his best to deny it . What ca n't be denied is the austerity and reality in which Jordan anchors his mystical topic or the way Moore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper-middle-class British life without a ripple , " catching perfectly the " unknowable " nature of her character . " I 've never seen anybody approach a part with less baggage , " he says .
