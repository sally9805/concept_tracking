Two guys with booklets itching for a fight . That 's what it 's come down to . Two candidates who have specific ideas for fixing an economy both describe as near collapse and who view each other 's prescriptions as deficient . " At some point , " says Paul Tsongas , " we 're going to have to go head to head on economics . " The sooner the better , says Bill Clinton . <P> Well , if it 's a debate they want , let it begin . <P> Note first that Clinton and Tsongas are new-breed Democrats . As they seek to craft a different relationship between government and the private economy , they challenge their party 's traditional orthodoxy . In some ways ( and especially when Tsongas touts his unabashed probusiness views ) , they sound like moderate Republicans , that nearly extinct species whose nostrums George Bush once championed . Tsongas enjoys a reputation as a hard-nosed economic truth teller , largely because he never tires of self-righteously describing himself in those terms . Clinton , on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syndrome " : If you 're good-looking , you ca n't be smart . In fact , though , if deep-think and specifics attract you , Clinton is the more forceful and articulate . <P> If you read their books , study their speeches and consider their extemporaneous remarks , Tsongas most often delivers topic sentences , while Clinton fills in the details . Tsongas ' writings are full of " we should consider this " and " we should think about that , " and the latest addendum to his 85-page booklet , A Call to Economic Arms , casually borrows some of Clinton 's stronger proposals  --  but only , it seems , for political cover , since Tsongas ' transparent me-tooism is only sporadically fleshed out . On some matters , however , like the wisdom of a middle-class tax cut ( which Tsongas opposes and Clinton supports ) and the idea of adjusting entitlement-program payments like Social Security to a person 's income ( which Tsongas is more willing to consider ) , Tsongas is clearly the more courageous . <P> , TAX CUTS . The sexiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut for the middle class . Clinton favors a revenue-neutral reduction in rates : the 15% tax rate would fall to 13.5% , the 28% rate to 26.5% . The net loss in Treasury receipts , about $30 billion , would be recaptured by raising the top income tax rate to 38% on earnings above $200,000 a year . On average , a middle-class family would gain about $350 a year , a " paltry " 97 cents a day , says Tsongas , who decries Clinton 's plan as a " pandering , poll-driven gimmick " that " wo n't create jobs or help our economy . " <P> For a brief time ( and then only in private ) , Clinton conceded Tsongas ' critique . He admitted that his plan was mostly symbolic . Political exigencies , he explained , required his signaling sympathy for the economically stressed . For public consumption , a rationale beyond sympathy is needed . So with a straight face and a fair amount of feigned indignation , Clinton regularly swipes at those who pooh-pooh his idea . " That $350 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but for many , it 's a month 's mortgage payment  --  and that 's nothing to sneeze at . " Suffice it to say that in New Hampshire , where the economy has moved from recession to depression , most Democratic voters seemed to side with Tsongas.
