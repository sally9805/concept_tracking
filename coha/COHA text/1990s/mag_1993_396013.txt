On April 22 , A. M. Rosenthal 's distinctive prose showed up in the Wall Street Journal : his reputation was on his mind . For more than ten years , Rosenthal  --  the former executive editor of the New York Times and now a columnist for the paper  --  has been dogged by charges that at the height of U.S. involvement in El Salvador he withdrew the paper 's correspondent there , Raymond Bonner , for political reasons . The episode had a profound effect on press coverage of Central America in the 1980s . Until Bonner 's recall , in August 1982 , correspondents reported extensively on the dismal human-rights situation in El Salvador . This greatly complicated the Reagan Administration 's efforts to prop up the Salvadoran military and " draw the line " against leftist forces in the region . Bonner 's sudden recall to New York , however , cast a deep chill over correspondents in Central America . It also raised a number of troubling questions that have yet to be answered : Did the Times bow to pressure from the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a threat ? What happens to a reporter when his or her interpretation of events contradicts that of the powers that be ? The Journal 's editorial page , with its strong rightward slant , would have seemed the last place in which to find Rosenthal accused of recalling Bonner . For years , in fact , the Right took gleeful credit for having persuaded the Times to pull the correspondent . In an editorial published on March 19 of this year , however , the Journal joined in the finger-pointing . " Eu tu ? " seems to be Rosenthal 's startled response . The El Mozote massacre was perhaps the single most controversial story of the entire Salvadoran saga . On January 27 , 1982 , Ray Bonner , in a front-page story for the Times , reported that " it is clear that a massacre of major proportions " took place in El Mozote , a village located in rebel-held territory . Bonner , who had been led to the site by guerrillas , cited estimates that between 733 and 926 unarmed men , women , and children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the area , including one survivor , Bonner concluded that Salvadoran soldiers had probably been responsible . A similar story , by Alma Guillermoprieto , appeared on the same day in the Washington Post . The articles caused a firestorm of protest against administration policy in El Salvador . Bonner came under withering attack from the State Department and from commentators on the Right , with the Journal leading the way . In a blistering editorial covering two full columns , the paper called Bonner " overly credulous " and dismissed his story as a " propaganda exercise . " The Journal suggested that Bonner and the Times would bear some of the blame if El Salvador went the way of Cuba . Seven months later , Bonner received a call from the Times foreign desk ordering him back to New York . He was replaced by a young reporter from the business section who had virtually no overseas experience . For more than a decade the truth about the massacre remained a matter of dispute . Then , in the fall of 1992 , with the Salvadoran conflict at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in El Mozote . They unearthed scores of skeletons , most of which belonged to children who clearly had been murdered . On October 22 , 1992 , the Times  --  now under the stewardship of Rosenthal 's successor , Max Frankel  --  reported in a front-page article that " nearly 11 years after American-trained soldiers were said to have torn through El Mozote and surrounding hamlets on a rampage in which at least 794 people were killed , the bones have emerged as stark evidence that the claims of peasant survivors and the reports of a couple of American journalists were true . " Further corroboration came in mid-March 1993 , when a United Nations-sponsored " Truth Commission , " concluding an investigation into human-rights abuses in El Salvador , stated that " it was fully proven " that a massacre took place at El Mozote , and that U.S.-trained infantry battalions were responsible . With Bonner vindicated , the Journal came under attack . CBS 's 60 Minutes , National Public Radio , and the Times itself , in an editorial , all chided the Journal for having smeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which it attempted to shift the blame to Rosenthal . The Times editor , it stated , had " pulled Mr. Bonner off the beat and back to New York , where he left the paper . If the Times thinks Mr. Bonner has been vindicated , it should stop carping at us and rehire him forthwith . " A decade earlier , when the Journal attacked Bonner , Rosenthal wrote not a singe word in his defense . Now , with his own reputation at stake , he weighs in with more than 1,200 . For years , Rosenthal has attempted to discredit this article , seeing it as the source of all his woes . Titled " About-face on El Salvador , " the piece  --  which I wrote  --  was based on interviews with more than a dozen correspondents , plus several Times editors ( including Rosenthal ) . The article described the government 's attacks on Bonner and the widespread impression among his colleagues that he was recalled because of them . Reviewing a year 's worth of articles appearing in the Times and other papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no less today  --  that the press 's coverage of death squads , land reform , and the Salvadoran military notably softened after Bonner 's departure . A red herring . No account of the incident has ever attributed any role to the CIA . In mentioning the agency , Rosenthal is apparently attempting to impute Oliver Stone-like tendencies to his critics . In spring 1982 , Rosenthal traveled to E1 Salvador , where he had lunch with the U.S. ambassador , Deane Hinton . According to a U.S. Embassy official I interviewed in 1983 , Hinton made clear to Rosenthal his displeasure over Bonner 's reporting . Certainly Hinton 's views were no secret . At a breakfast with reporters in Washington in June 1982 , for instance , he called Bonner an " advocate journalist "  --  i.e. , a guerrilla sympathizer . In addition , Thomas Enders , the assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs , had attacked the Mozote-massacre stories in testimony before Congress . Stating that the U.S. Embassy had sent two officials to the village to investigate the incident , Enders asserted that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces systematically massacred civilians in the operations zone . " Last March the State Department acknowledged that , based on newly available evidence , the reporting by Bonner and Guillermoprieto was accurate . As recent news reports have made clear , the two embassy officials sent to investigate the massacre never actually reached El Mozote ; rather , they had to rely on interviews with refugees from the area . Even then , one of the officials had concluded that large numbers of civilians had probably been killed . This information was conveyed to Deane Hinton . Rather than investigate further , though , the ambassador focused his fury on the messenger  --  i.e. , Bonner . It 's nice to learn that the notoriously thin-skinned Rosenthal was so open to people 's complaints , and that he paid them all equal attention . No doubt a letter from Joe Citizen would have received as much of his attention as a phone call from an ambassador or assistant secretary of state . Rosenthal 's notion of threats is interesting as well . Certainly few officials would be so crass as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the Reagan Administration had only to " complain " about a story to cast doubts about its author 's patriotism  --  and about a newspaper 's continued access to government officials for quotes , " background " interviews , and the like . What went through Rosenthal 's mind when he ordered Bonner out of El Salvador is , of course , anybody 's guess . Given Rosenthal 's well-known political views , he may not have needed much prodding from the government . He has freely admitted that when he was executive editor he believed the Times had gotten too liberal . Not long after Bonner 's recall from El Salvador , the paper ran several articles by conservative journalist Claire Sterling asserting that the Soviet bloc was behind the assassination attempt on the pope . And , in 1985 , Rosenthal hired Shirley Christian , a Miami Herald correspondent known for her vehemently anti-Sandinista views . To many , the shift from Bonner to Christian summed up the Times 's ideological journey under Rosenthal . Bonner did have an unusual resume for a reporter . A lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marine Corps , including a year in Vietnam . He had also worked as a litigator for Ralph Nader in Washington and as a lawyer in the district attorney 's office in San Francisco . Tiring of law , Bonner went to South America in 1979 and began " stringing " for news organizations . By December 1980 he had made his way to El Salvador , where he began a trial with the Times . With the violence there escalating , the paper soon made him a full-time correspondent . Bonner 's reporting was not without flaws . In January 1982 , for instance , he wrote an article maintaining that a group of U.S. Army advisers had sat in on two torture sessions conducted by Salvadoran soldiers . Based on the statements of a single self-proclaimed defector , the story turned out to be false . In fact , Bonner had already been back to New York for such training . He had returned in January 1981 , soon after being hired , and had spent most of the next ten months on the metro desk . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fall of 1981 , Bonner was thoroughly familiar with Times procedures . Hardly the whole story . On his return to New York , Bonner was assigned to the Times 's business desk . When the Anne Burford scandal erupted at the Environmental Protection Agency , he was sent to Washington , where he scored several scoops on the issue . He also broke stories about secret Pentagon spying operations in Central America and on Reagan Administration plans to build a military base in Honduras . The Washington bureau wanted to keep Bonner in the capital to cover U.S. policy in Central America . The deal was all but done when New York made clear its opposition . Discouraged , Bonner took some time off in the summer of 1983 to write a book about El Salvador . Rejoining the paper in the fall , he was reassigned to the business section but was told he would eventually end up on metro  --  clearly a demotion . With his days at the Times numbered , Bonner in July 1984 reluctantly left the paper . He went on to write a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position as a writer with The New Yorker , where he remained until late last year . In a way , the whole episode comes down to who duped whom . In its March 19 editorial , the Journal claimed that its editorial of eleven years earlier had " never denied that there was a massacre at El Mozote . " In fact , the paper had unquestioningly accepted Enders 's denials about the massacre . The whole point of its attack on Bonner was to discredit his El Mozote report and pave the way for U.S. aid to El Salvador . As the Truth Commission report now makes clear , it was the Wall Street Journal , and not Ray Bonner , that was duped . As for Rosenthal , he , too , seems to have been taken in . Michael Massing has written for The New York Review of Books and other publications . He was named a MacArthur Fellow in 1992 , and is at work on a book about the drug war . <p>            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
