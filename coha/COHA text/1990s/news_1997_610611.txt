<p> The Washington Opera has scrapped original plans for its new home in the Woodward &; Lothrop building and come up with a radical new opera house design that transforms most of the former department store into a semicircular colonnade reminiscent of the South Portico of the White House . <p> The monumental design , its backers say , would provide the nation 's capital with an opera house superior to the Metropolitan Opera in New York and comparable to La Scala in Milan . But its $ 200 million price tag  --  nearly double original estimates  --  has left even proponents fearful the entire project may now be out of the opera 's reach . <p> The design also proposes demolition of roughly two-thirds  --  albeit the less historic part  --  of a building registered as a historic landmark . That could entangle the company in a preservation battle that would further endanger the project . <p> There is little argument , however , with the ambition of the design . Though its stage would be slightly smaller and the number of seats  --  2,100  --  no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company has performed for the past 25 years , the new house would increase its stage storage area by at least a third and nearly double its rehearsal space . It would also provide scene-shifting technology sophisticated enough to stage four different operas on succeeding nights , thereby greatly expanding both the scope of productions that could be staged by the company and the number of performances possible for each one . <p> It would also inject money and energy into a long-listless downtown area that is slowly reawakening as an entertainment center with the relocated Shakespeare Theatre and the new MCI Arena . <p> The plans were drawn up by a team headed by architect James Ingo Freed of Pei , Cobb , Freed &; Partners , the New York firm responsible for I.M. Pei 's East Building of the National Gallery of Art and Freed 's U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum . The plans were presented to the opera 's board of trustees last month . A copy was obtained by The Washington Post . <p> The design departs sharply from the preliminary plan approved by the D.C. zoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opera house entirely within the existing facade of the Woodies building , except for the addition of an extra story housing a rooftop restaurant and other facilities . <p> In the new design the extra floor and the restaurant are gone and the main entrance has been moved from G Street to F Street . In addition , the stage has been shifted from the south to the north end of the building . But the most dramatic departure is the way the architects have broken out of the boxlike confines of the existing structure 's southern end to incorporate space above the sidewalks on 11th Street and F Street . That move , achieved by sacrificing the least distinguished part of the Woodies building , would make the sidewalks themselves arcades that skirt the building . <p> Though even the preliminary opera house plans include gutting Woodies ' interior , the exterior demolition envisioned by the new design would require a special exemption from the city 's historic preservation law . The design also would need special building code variances to project beyond the property line and over the sidewalks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's liaison with the architects , said he has had no formal meetings with District officials about the design . " But I 've shown the plans informally to some people in town who are usually pretty good indicators about what will pass and what wo n't , " he said . <p> Acoustical considerations helped drive the plan to scrap most of the existing structure , according to architect Charles Young of Pei , Cobb , Freed &; Partners . The building stands atop the Metro Center subway station and extensive tests showed that the stage and auditorium would need special structural treatment to isolate them from the vibrations of trains traveling directly underneath . <p> " You just could n't do that with an existing building , " Young said . Improvements to the lobby , auditorium and backstage areas also were important . " As we worked on the plans , it just became apparent that the needs of the opera were pushing out beyond the existing building . " <p> Inside , the new plans call for a four-tiered , horseshoe-shaped auditorium reminiscent of the great opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dome whose lighting could be coordinated with stage effects . The stage itself , though slightly smaller than that of the Kennedy Center Opera House , would be far more efficient due to a high-tech system of stage elevators designed to lift entire sets out of sight above the stage or raise them from storage below . <p> Christine Hunter , chairman of the opera 's executive board and a major financial patron of the company , calls the design " absolutely magnificent . . . everything we could hope for . " The $ 200 million price tag , she admits , has made the project a long shot , " but anything is possible . Who would ever have dreamed the Washington Opera would have Placido Domingo as its artistic director ? " <p> Hunter , Domingo and many other sources at the opera emphasize that the uncertainties of the Woodies project and efforts by the Kennedy Center to accommodate the opera there have forced the company to proceed on several fronts simultaneously in planning for its future . <p> When Betty Brown Casey , the wealthy Potomac businesswoman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy the Woodies building and donate it to the company for a new opera house , executives of the Kennedy Center appeared to shrug off the prospective departure of their largest tenant and some $ 1 million a year in rent . They even announced that renovation plans for their own opera house would have evicted the Washington Opera long before the Woodies project could have been finished , leaving the company homeless for at least one season and shopping for stage access in venues like DAR Constitution Hall . <p> Last spring , however , Kennedy Center officials changed tactics , inviting Washington Opera executives to become virtual partners in both the timing and the extent of renovations to the existing Opera House . <p> Subsequent meetings have reportedly gone an appreciable distance in meeting the Washington Opera 's needs , raising the possibility that the company could expand its present eight-opera season to nine or 10 by 2000 . <p> Kennedy Center officials have also postponed the center 's Opera House renovation , forestalling the possibility of an interim opera season in temporary quarters . <p> " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are very happy that we will continue to be in the Kennedy Center for the next four or five years . " <p> But major roadblocks remain . One is a major shortage of rehearsal space , which is only getting worse as the opera company 's productions get more ambitious . The present production of " I Pagliacci " had to be rehearsed at Howard University at times , because of stage scheduling problems at the Kennedy Center . Another is the Washington Opera 's interest in expanding both the length and the scope of its seasons at a time when most tickets are already sold out by the time the season begins . <p> Thus the opera still wants the Woodies project . " It is very exciting and , I believe , very possible , " Domingo said . " And it would do so much for downtown Washington . People forget what the neighborhood around Lincoln Center was like before it opened in New York . " <p> But Domingo and others recognize that they must either raise $ 200 million by the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodies building , or surrender that hope and try instead to shape the renovation of the Kennedy Center Opera House as much as possible to their own needs . <p> Theoretically the company could sell the Woodies building and look for another site . But Reutershan said an opera house of the quality the Washington Opera wants would be little cheaper anywhere else . Said the opera 's executive director , Patricia Mossel : " We 're really not even considering that alternative . " Any new opera house would take at least three years to build . Meanwhile , the Kennedy Center needs to know by next summer just for what and for whom its own updated opera house is to be designed . <p> That renovation would be largely paid for by the federal government . But the problem with it , says Washington Opera technical director Noel Uzemack , is that what would work best for the Kennedy Center management " is a ' box , ' and what we need is a ' machine . ' " Touring shows like " The Phantom of the Opera " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space , Uzemack said . The Washington Opera needs expensive , opera-specific stage systems built in  --  systems the Kennedy Center itself has little economic incentive to install . <p> Thus the opera company faces not only a huge fund-raising challenge but only four months in which to meet it . Yet the chief fund-raiser for the Woodies project , Washington attorney Max N. Berry , insists he 's optimistic . <p> Berry , who chaired the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corp. , which remade " America 's Main Street " and has a big-ticket international clientele , says those skeptical of the Woodies opera house have a short-range view of buildings  --  a view conditioned by the disposable convention centers and office buildings of the 1980s . <p> " An opera house is a national monument that 's going to be around a long , long time , " he says . " I tell people La Scala was built the year before George Washington became president . It 's been in business ever since and it has n't exactly been bad for downtown Milan . " <p> Berry started his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I already have $ 25 million committed . There 's another $ 25 million I 'm pretty sure to have by the end of the week . " There 's also " $ 10 million or $ 20 million in smaller gifts floating around that I could probably get , but we obviously have to first target really big donors capable of giving $ 25 million , $ 50 million or $ 100 million at a shot . " <p> He is searching for those donors in Western Europe and Asia , " where they understand the value of being identified with something as significant as a free-standing opera house . Will a country or a corporation or some elderly wealthy person think it 's worth $ 100 million to have their name stamped forever on the auditorium of the world 's best opera house ? In the capital of the Free World ? We 'll just have to see . " <p> Staff writer Benjamin Forgey contributed to this report .
