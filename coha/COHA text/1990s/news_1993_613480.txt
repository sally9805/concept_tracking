<p> The flood that has devastated the Midwest - and continues to threaten it - has inspired awe of the Mississippi River and left a toll of carnage : 48 people killed ; 40,000 homeless ; an estimated $ 12 billion in damage ; enough crops destroyed to raise food prices across the nation . <p> Yet destructive as it has been , and despite the title " greatest flood of the century , " which journalists have attached to it , the flood of 1993 pales , thankfully , next to the great Mississippi River flood of 1927 . <p> The flood of 1927 killed at least 313 people ( some estimates placed the death toll at more than 1,000 ) and left 1.5 million homeless - more than 1 percent of the country 's population at the time . Its economic impact , if damage is measured as a percentage of the country 's total economy , quintupled that of 1993 . <p> In 1927 , for a thousand miles , from Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico , the Mississippi flooded , stretching in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The flood 's repercussions shook the political world and affected flood control policy for years to come . <p> Now people have begun to question this policy again . Neither the issues nor the arguments are new , and comparing the two floods , and the policies in force to deal with them , can teach a lesson . <p> Like the recent flood , the 1927 flood began with heavy rains in the preceding year . In 1992 and 1993 , the excess rain fell chiefly on those states directly bordering on the upper Mississippi and the Missouri rivers . In 1926 and 1927 , excess precipitation fell over the entire drainage basin of the Mississippi . <p> This drainage basin , the Mississippi Valley , includes more than 40 percent of the continental United States . It is a valley which exceeds by 20 percent that of the Yangtze River , is twice that of the Nile , 15 times that of the Rhine . Much of 35 states and two Canadian provinces in the valley drain into numerous tributary rivers - including the Ohio , the Missouri , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Water that falls upon this area , and which is not held by the soil or evaporated into the air , drains like water poured into a funnel , through the lower Mississippi River , the spout of the funnel , into the Gulf of Mexico . <p> This enormity of water was , the Army Corps of Engineers decreed in 1879 , to be confined within narrow levees . The reason : the Corps adhered to an engineering theory which hypothesized that forcing the river into a narrow channel would increase the velocity of the current . <p> This faster current would allow the river to carry more water both by scouring out the bottom of the channel , deepening and increasing its capacity , and by moving the water to the Gulf faster . After this hypothesis worked brilliantly in solving one major problem on the river , the Corps applied what became known as the " levees only " policy to the entire length of the river . <p> The Corps not only successfully opposed construction of dams , reservoirs , or spillways , it also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water was to be forced between the levees . <p> Finally , in 1926 , federal , state , and local governments completed a great levee system capable of protecting against floods in the lower river 3 feet higher than any high water on record . Gen. Edgar Jadwin , chief of the Corps of Engineers , proudly proclaimed that the levees were " now in condition to prevent the destructive effects of floods . " <p> But there were two problems . First , squeezing the water into a narrower space also forced the water level higher . If water could not spread out it would spread up . Second , extremely heavy rains began in the second week of August 1926 - similar to but not as severe as this summer 's rains - extending from Kansas and Oklahoma as far east as Pennsylvania . <p> Floods in three states set records . The rain did not abate . Through the fall the Mississippi itself smashed old records on river gauges . Precipitation continued . Rivers both east and west of the Mississippi rose . <p> On Dec. 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commercial- Appeal blared , " Floods Caused by Record Rains Spread Death and Destruction in Four States ! " Flooding got worse . It was more than seven months before river news left the front page . <p> The rains did not abate . Rivers reached flood stage and stayed there . The Wabash River was at flood stage for 90 days , the Illinois was in flood for 186 days , and the Mississippi would remain in flood for 153 days . <p> Hundreds of thousands of acres lost <p> By early April 1927 , the rising waters had already made 15,000 homeless in four states . Yet until then few levees , and none on the Mississippi itself , had yielded . Most flooding came from backwater - the Mississippi was so high that water in tributaries draining into it piled up , flooding hundreds of thousands of acres . <p> Then the weather turned violent . In a three-week period , tornadoes killed more than 300 people . Intense thunderstorms poured down . In New Orleans on April 15 , rain - 14 inches of it - fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way up the river past Memphis , and west to Oklahoma . <p> With the land already saturated , the rain ran off into the rivers , generating tremendous force . A freight train of coal was parked on a bridge over the Arkansas River in Little Rock : The vibrations of the current ignited the coal . On the Mississippi , the always ravenous , roiling currents moved at enormous speed , in some places at 14 knots . <p> An immense weight of water was moving down the river , relentlessly pushing outward against levees , seeking to spread out , rising higher . By comparison , this year the upper Mississippi in Iowa has carried as much as 371,000 cubic feet of water each second - a record for that part of the river . In 1927 , however , the lower Mississippi carried as much as 3 million cubic feet of water every second . The levees could not hold . <p> More than 100 levee breaks recorded <p> On April 21 , 15 miles above Greenville , Miss. , the greatest single levee break ever on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ground shook and the sound carried for miles ; a witness compared the noise to " a thousand freight trains . " Water poured out over the Mississippi Delta at a rate of 468,000 cubic feet per second , more water than two Niagaras , more than the entire upper Mississippi has ever carried , including in 1993 . <p> This single break flooded 60 miles to the east and 90 miles to the south with up to 20 feet of water . Much of this water then flowed back into the Mississippi , overwhelmed the levee on the Louisiana side , and flooded as far as 70 miles to the west . <p> In total , the 1927 flood caused more than 100 levee breaks . The most consequential break occurred near New Orleans . The people there , terrified at the huge volume of water bearing down on them , insisted that a spillway be created to allow some of the river water to escape . With the approval of the federal government , state engineers dynamited the levee a few miles outside the city . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy . <p> What policy would replace it ? <p> As engineer J.F. Kemper wrote in 1927 : " In attempting to control floods in the past , the idea seems to have prevailed that the water had no rights . . . . Time and again it has exposed its assailants ' error , notwithstanding which fact that nearly 200 years were required to convince aggressive and arrogant man that the river will cooperate with him only so long as he respects the law . That law is the divine law of nature . " <p> Congress establishes new guidelines <p> Legislation in 1928 , with later modifications , went partway toward respecting the law of nature . Congress established three principles . <p> First , the Corps of Engineers would treat the river and its tributaries in a comprehensive fashion , which it had not heretofore done . <p> Second , the Corps would raise and strengthen the levee system . Clearly there was no substitute for levees , and levees would remain the chief means of flood protection . <p> The Corps was also directed to ease the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spillways , cutoffs , dams and reservoirs to help manage the flow of water and keep river heights lower . These reservoirs functioned well in 1993 , though they proved insufficient to the enormous task at hand . <p> Third , the 1928 legislation provided that local governments would make some financial contribution to flood control . This principle eroded over the years , but the Reagan administration reinstituted it . One reason the city of Davenport , Iowa , rejected flood control projects in the 1980s was that it balked at paying its share of the bill . <p> But there was a fourth principle which was struck from the 1928 bill - the id ea that man could not and should not prevent the river from reclaiming some land in great floods . <p> The original bill called for " fuse-plug levees " on the river . These levees would be high enough to protect against most floods , but not great ones . In great floods , the river would overwhelm the fuse-plug levees and transform the land they protected into both an emergency reservoir and a floodway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could use this land , but at their own risk . Pressure on remaining levees would be eased , saving other lands . But strong opposition from politicians who represented areas to be sacrificed , including the Senate Democratic leader , killed the idea . <p> Complete protection of land unacceptable <p> In the wake of the 1993 flood , the same questions about flood control arise again . There is still no substitute for levees ; the human and economic costs of allowing the river to roam free are unacceptable . <p> Yet , complete protection of the land is equally unacceptable . The expense of making the entire levee system strong enough to withstand heavy flooding might well cost more than the flood 's damage , and it would likely not work anyway - it would just repeat the mistake the Corps made prior to 1927 . <p> There are really only two viable alternatives . The first is strengthening the levees and creating some kind of fuse-plug levee system . This would have costs as well , requiring limitation on development and a compensation scheme generous enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too valuable to lie fallow . <p> The second alternative - do nothing , beyond tinkering with such programs as flood insurance and , again , strengthening the levees somewhat . This option is reasonable . While the 1993 flood is not the worst for the whole river , it is the worst ever on the upper Mississippi . If no similar rains fall for 200 years , then doing nothing would be the best policy . <p> Finally , this flood may be a warning for the lower Mississippi as well . Because the Ohio River and other tributaries were not in flood this year , the lower river has had no problems handling the water from above . The 1927 flood remains the greatest on record on the lower river , and the levee and outlet system there has been built to handle an even larger flood . But no one knows how large . <p> John M.
