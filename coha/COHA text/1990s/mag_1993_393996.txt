Diana Bader , O.P. , is vice-president for mission leadership , Sisters of Providence Health System , Seattle , Wash. , and formerly senior associate for clinical ethics of the Catholic Health Association . This interview took place during the annual convention of the Catholic Health Association in New Orleans , June 6-9 . The interviewer is James S. Torrens , associate editor of America . In my early days , Catholic health care consisted of a local hospital , with a fair sprinkling of sisters , with doctors who were lords of everybody except the administration , and the administrators  --  a Sister Philippa or a Sister Leonette  --  who were real forces to be reckoned with . Now , I notice , there are lay C.E.O . ' s and many connected services  --  a whole new picture , I gather . The hospital is still largely at the center of the health care delivery system , but sisters are not present in the same numbers ; in the typical Catholic hospital you may encounter one or two . You will find more of them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hands of sisters . You will see many laymen and laywomen in these roles . The direction of the Catholic health system today , our way of delivering health care , is diversifying greatly . The hospital now takes its place along with primary care clinics , or networks of smaller units , providing general medical care . Primary care includes even certain forms of surgery , what is called " ambulatory care . " You walk in one day and walk out the same day , with health needs satisfied . Home health care is a focus . What also is beginning is the formation of networks of health care . Today , in a typical midwest metropolitan area , you may find from three to ten major hospitals , all sponsored by different organizations or religious congregations that do n't necessarily work together ; in fact they may even be competitors . These various entities are going to have to form networks , if they want to continue to deliver quality health care . Our Sisters of Providence health system extends over a number of West Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develops as it should , it will facilitate not just delivery of services but also administration . Today a patient coming into a hospital or an outpatient clinic for some sort of surgery can have lab tests , x-rays , primary and specialist doctor visits , with new records each time but no enhancement of quality . In an integrated and coordinated system , that patient should have one point of entry and the records should follow the person , without duplication of services along the way . People are overwhelmed with the costs . The other piece that has to be integrated is payment . In the Sisters of Providence Health System we have not just the health care delivery  --  hospitals , clinics , skilled nursing care , home health and hospice  --  we also have coverage through a health plan . We enroll people , our subscribers , into a health plan . So we receive not only the patients but payment for those people , and we distribute that money to those who provide the care . We might have a contract with a large employer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his or her employees , and would pay us . We have staff who manage the money they receive . Is that what is being called a " Hippic " ? " Hippics " ( H.I.P.C. : health insurance purchasing cooperative ) is one of the features of the proposed reform . They would be like an intermediary between the employer and the actual provider of the care . Washington State has recently enacted a health care reform that sets up these health insurance purchasing cooperatives , which will be the intermediaries in managing that money . Take the example of a large employer , like Boeing . Boeing normally would not go and contract directly with Providence Hospital  --  although it could  --  but would do so through some intermediary . Different states are experimenting with variations of this model . So there is a big change underway in funding and payment  --  fee for service as against capitation , correct ? For people who have insurance , fee-for-service is pretty much what they know . When you go to a physician in private practice , the physician bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly . With managed care we are moving either to some combination , where fee for service still has a place , or to a model where the physician will be an employee of the hospital or of the health system . In capitation my doctor is paid a certain amount to provide my health care , and all of it must be provided for that amount . Rather than my doctor charging a fee every time I go for a visit , the doctor gets so much for taking care of me . Does he , or she , get anything if you do n't need care ? Let 's say that a company with 200 employees purchases health care from the Sisters of Providence . Our staff will have worked out that it costs , say , $1,200 to provide a level of health care for each of those 200 employees . That is what the employer will pay the Sisters of Providence . The Sisters of Providence have to look carefully at this particular subscriber population . If it has a high incidence of poverty , or drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken into consideration . Or it may be at risk statistically because of environmental hazards , as in areas near a nuclear facility . Let 's also say there are more older persons , with chronic illness ; they are at higher risk of illness . In setting rates , our staff would have to determine the health risk . If the group proves to need less heath care than we had predicted , or less costly care , that is to our advantage . If they have a much higher incidence of illness , or more expensive illness , then we have to absorb the cost . One of the imperatives of health care reform is that nobody be disqualified because of pre-existing conditions , as the insurance companies do now . The insurance companies want to insure young healthy people . Those who are susceptible to illness are not welcome . This is one of the most unjust features of our health care system in the United States ; it works against those who need care most . Reform looks rather to universal coverage , based on community rating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular individual . In the new Washington State health bill , nobody can be disqualified on the basis of individual health risk . You have referred to " managed care . " Please throw some light on this concept . Better , I can illustrate what " managed care " means . I am enrolled through the Sisters of Providence in a H.M.O. health maintenance organization , which receives an annual payment for my health care . My care is directed by a primary care physician whom I have selected . I can make regular visits or have consultation by phone . I can go to a medical specialist only through referral by my primary physician . For most people today , if you decide you need specialty care , for example for your ear , you just call the specialist doctor 's office and go . I can not do that in this H.M.O. arrangement , where the primary-care physician is the " gatekeeper " for all health care . The H.M.O. " manages " my care and is at risk for any costs over the amount received in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordinate care better , it should also reduce the cost . Right now a lot of what specialists provide may not need to come from them . In the case of the ear condition , a primary care physician may recognize that this is a mild infection that can be treated simply , or she may say this is complicated and specialist . Dr. Keller of Ochsner Clinic in New Orleans , speaking to us about the new emphasis on the primary-care physician , quoted Macchiavelli : " The innovator has for enemies all who have done well in the old system . " Does this changing picture set off alarm bells for doctors ? Of course . In the changes now underway , physicians ' practice will be truly affected . Capitation and managed care will put less emphasis on specialists and more on primary care physicians  --  internists , family care physicians , pediatricians . What specialists see is more work for the primary care physicians and less work for them . Right now we have a shortage of primary care physicians . Medical students , more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be three or four times more than that of primary care physicians . But what physicians see ahead is a general reallocation and redistribution of resources . Limits are going to be set on the amount of payment , or reimbursement . The Harvard Study concerning resource-based relative value , showed that , for example , surgeons and neurologists and pathologists and anesthesiologists are more highly paid than primary care physicians for a comparable amount of work time . A pediatrician can spend an hour or more in an appointment with a patient , while a surgeon who spends a comparable time may be paid three or four times as much . Health care advisers are calling for adjustment of the payment scale . Physicians have always been an independent group . They do not see themselves , in the ideal world , as being employed by hospitals or health systems . But they are going to have to relate to hospitals and to networks much more closely . We 're always going to need doctors , but , yes , they are very uneasy about what the future holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ True , and there are a lot of models for it . But in the past physicians choosing such practice have done so deliberately . For example we 've noticed a strong correlation between an increasing number of women going into medicine and the formation of group practices . Women often are not interested in working long hours , whether because of commitment to their families or other interests . A group practice provides the opportunity to rotate for coverage on weekends . H.M.O. 's have been around since at least the 1950 's . Some H.M.O. 's have a model of physician practice , where they actually are integrated into the organization . They work in groups and have more regular hours . But it is one thing to choose to go into such an arrangement , it is another to be pushed that way in a process of change . The change should alleviate the regulatory burden and paperwork for doctors , should n't it ? It should . One of the greatest areas of increasing cost is in administration of health care . The increasing paperwork drives up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada . With their universal one-payor system , administrative costs are by comparison very , very small . Religious health care leaders are still , abundantly , Catholic religious women , with some orders of brothers as well . Will this new form of health care stir the same kind of generosity , encourage religious vocations ? We need to be pretty clear about how we understand " vocations . " If we talk of attracting people to participate in what is a formal and official ministry of the church , namely healing and health care , you can see the numbers of laymen and laywomen who are profoundly mission-driven , very value-oriented , who care deeply not solely about the money or professional prestige but about how well people are treated , about the quality of care they receive . Clearly this is a ministry that has always attracted people . As sisters and religious brothers have become fewer , there has never been any problem in attracting lay people to take those positions and to take on that leadership . If you are thinking of vocation in a narrower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congregation , I do n't see any evidence that what happens in Catholic health care is going to determine people 's decisions to join a religious order or to make public profession of vows . If you think of religious life as providing a lifestyle for participating in health ministry , you do n't have to join a religious order to contribute to this ministry . " Religious life , " though not unrelated to this , is not to a sine qua non for engaging in health ministry . I think that the question of religious life , its place in the church and its future is much , much more complex . But up to now the sponsorship of the health ministry has come from religious orders . Sponsorship is a bigger question . It is something that all sponsoring groups are now working on , since they have fewer and fewer people to be involved in health care , to serve on boards , to participate in the sponsoring activities . As we see the diminishment of religious life in terms of numbers and the availability of religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the future ? Religious sponsorship is not incompatible with the demise of religious orders . It may then be in the hand of lay groups , though that is not going to happen immediately . But there are people who will be as dedicated as the ministry requires . Earlier in the C.H.A. convention , Prof. Uwe Rinehardt ( political economist , Princeton University ) referred to the ethical , religious input that Catholic health core should have into the national debate . What did he have in mind ? We profess to be coming from a base and origin and history that is explicitly value-centered , a continuation and in extension of the teachings of the Gospel . Other health care providers , whether community hospitals or whatever , while they certainly are dedicated to quality of service , do not , as we do , present themselves as disciples of Jesus who abide by His teaching and exemplify and live by what He proposed . Those ideals include love for people regardless of their circumstances , justice and fairness , compassion and mercy , striving to be excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear to me that when Professor Rinehardt read the proposal from the Catholic Health Association he found those values expressed . As a staff member at the C.H.A. , before joining the Providence system , you took part in the development of that proposal . Can you say a word about C.H.A. ? C.H.A. is a member organization , serving Catholic health care providers throughout the United States . Membership is voluntary . Catholic hospitals are the largest member group , but more and more long-term-care facilities and other entities are joining . The association provides a variety of services : theology , ethics , pastoral care and mission ; legal and sponsorship services ; government services ( based in Washington , D.C. ) engaged in advocacy for a just health care system . The latter group led in developing the health care proposal . Is C.H.A. unhappy with any features of the Clinton plan as it comes out ? That is very hard to comment on because , as Uwe Rinehardt also said , we are getting a strip-tease act , a little bit revealed here , a little there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as President Clinton laid out are very consistent with C.H.A. proposals  --  for instance universal access , the insistence that everybody in the country have access to health care . Containing the cost is another principle , keeping the costs of health care within a reasonable range . The C.H.A. proposal places the patient and the community at the center of the proposal ; it does not say first , " We have to control cost . " The first question for the C.H.A. is , " How do we provide the best quality care for all persons , with appropriate constraints on cost ? " The messages that come out of Washington , D.C. , certainly out of Congress , give the impression that the overriding concern is , " How do we cut costs ? " Certain provisions , I suppose , such as for funding of abortion , make the C.H.A. uneasy . Nobody around the country is going to support the funding of services that they believe are objectionable . But I do think that we should not be taking an unequivocal stand on something so complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the covered services , we can not participate , is premature , I believe , very short-sighted , because there are a number of values that are in conflict . One of the current intolerable evils in this country is that we have somewhere between 37 million and 40 million people with zero health care , and another 30 million with indequate health care . If that is not the overiding evil , I do n't know what is . To look at everything through the lens of abortion , as if that is the only issue , I find to be a distortion of what the Gospel is about and of the scale of human needs . I think we need much more dialogue on this subject . In the State of Washington abortion will be a covered service . But we as providers will not have to provide that because we have developed a conscience clause that exempts us . We can be creative in dealing with these complex questions . <p>                  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and nothing I 'd ever told him I wanted By Ann Hood <p> I am a woman who likes traditional presents : lingerie , kitchen appliances , and Chanel No. 5  --  my signature scent since I was 15 years old . I still remember wandering down the perfume aisle at Jordan Marsh sampling Chloe ( my mother 's perfume ) , then picking up the atomizer with the interlocking C 's . It was love at first spray . <p> Even I , a girl from a small mill town , knew who Coco Chanel was ; I 'd heard Marilyn Monroe 's line that all she wore to bed was her Chanel No. 5 . Except for a short misguided period when I switched to Chanel No. 19 ( silver bottle , citrusy , less cachet ) , I 've stuck with the scent , believing it has the power to transform me into someone sophisticated . <p> So when my husband , Lorne , walked into my birthday party a couple of years ago carrying a box from Nordstrom , I was pleased but not surprised  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my usual sleek , black Chanel refill , an elaborate bottle with a " C " logo  --  but this " C " stood for Cartier 's Le Baiser du Dragon . <p> " I know it 's not Channel Five , " said Lorne , using our pet name , " but I smelled this at the counter and loved it so much I had to buy it for you . " My husband has liked to nuzzle my neck , murmuring how good I smell , since the night we first shared a bowl of pasta at Carmella 's restaurant . Now , a dozen years later , he 's buying me a different perfume . <p> Passing up someone 's scent is like rejecting that person , is n't it ? When a baboon does n't like the way a female smells , he finds himself a different baboon that smells better . <p> " If you do n't like it , " my husband was saying , " you can take it back . " Of course I wanted to take it back ! Still , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baboon , did I ? <p> The very next night , on our way to a party , he took a big sniff near my neck and said , " Ooh , is that the new perfume I gave you ? " <p> " Nope , " I said , " it 's still Channel Five . " He seemed disappointed  --  but who was he to complain when he could n't even smell the difference ? <p> When I told my friend what Lorne had done , she was aghast . " Bring it back , " she said . " You have to . ' " <p> " Keep it . " another friend advised me . " Wear it . You have to . " <p> " What 's the big deal ? " a third friend asked me . " You do n't wear the clothes you wore when you were 15 years old , do you ? " <p> " Uh , " I said , " actually , I do . " <p> The next afternoon I found myself in Nordstrom , conducting a Cartier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . I sniffed my wrist . I smelled like a stranger . <p> That night , our 12-year-old son had a sleepover in the attic with a bunch of his buddies . Going up to check on them . I was ambushed by a cloud of Axe cologne . " They say it attracts girls , " one of them offered as I backed out the door , choking on the fumes . <p> I hated the smell , but I loved the power of their belief . Climbing into the shower . I remembered the long-ago summer when my friend Beth and I wore Love 's Fresh Lemon every day . believing it promised kisses and fields of daisies . Not long after . I switched my allegiance to a whole different kind of beast : Tigress roll-on , which made me feel powerful . Last of all came Chanel . From my very first whiff , it whispered to me of sophistication , travel to far-flung places , love . <p> Out of the shower . I dressed for a special evening : an art-gallery opening , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I picked up that ornate bottle with the other C What did I have to lose ? <p> I sprayed myself , sneezed several times , and slipped on my little black dress . All night I waited for Lorne to say something . He did n't , but everyone else did . and they loved it . <p> Back in the car , I said to Lorne . " Did you notice ? I 'm wearing that perfume you gave me . " <p> He leaned in and nuzzled my neck . " Mmm . You smell delicious , " he said . " But then , you always do . " <p> That 's when I knew : The Cartier was n't intended to make me over . It was just a gift  --  a whimsical , romantic message in a bottle from a guy who. after almost 14 years , still only has eyes ( and a nose ) for me . <p> Ann Hood 's most recent books are The Knitting Circle and Comfort : A Journey Through Grief . <p> L : Forgive or Forget ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By Jenny Allen Your spouse does something you can not believe .

Something you would n't do because you are such a nice person . <p> Everyone always says what a nice person you are . Your neighbor Mrs. Lipkis always says what a nice person you are . Mrs. Lipkis is a Holocaust survivor .

You 're just the person who is yelling " I ca n't believe you did that " all the time . And that , as I 've said , is your problem . Even if it 's his problem , it 's your problem . <p> Sometimes you just have to ignore the offensive or selfish or clueless thing . <p> Or you have to decide it 's funny . I 'm sorry to sound like Norman Cousins , but almost everything is , sooner or later , and it might as well be sooner . <p> Ca n't you ever be irked ? Ca n't you ever be angry ?

" " No , you shut up ! " <p> That 's everything I know about getting along in a marriage , and it 's hardly anything . I tried to fit some other rules in here that I 've always heard about , but I realized that I knew happily married people who 'd broken each of them . I know couples who " talk things out " whose conversations seem to produce one sullen misunderstanding after another , and couples who would sooner die than express their feelings with anything approaching sincerity who nonetheless understand each other perfectly . I know couples who have been utterly faithful to each other  --  the better , it seems , to dedicate themselves to making each other 's life a living hell , and cheating spouses who  --  well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule to a long marriage , as I see it : You have to try not to get mad that much .

But the kitchen  --  well , that 's another story By Ellen Sussman <p> It 's 6 P.M. , and the guests arrive at 7 . My husband and I are in the kitchen , prepping the five-course meal . He 's mid-stir. ; I 'm mid-chop . I reach for the salt , and his spoon goes flying . We bump hips while carrying pots to the counter . I look at his sauce and tell him I think it needs more butter . He does n't add butter . Sauce splashes on my shirt . He tells me to go change ; he 'll take care of everything . If I do , I know he 'll add sherry to my shrimp dish . <p> Our guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to sit around the fire . I put my hand on my husband 's thigh , and he covers my hand with his own . We just survived two hours of madness , and we 're back where we belong . Side by side . We even joke about , it with our friends  --  He 's stubborn and cranky in the kitchen ! She 's bossy and sloppy in the kitchen !  --  but they do n't care . We throw a mean party . <p> A few of the friends are his ( from law school ) and a few are mine ( writer friends and holdovers from my first marriage ) . Everything has fit together so easily in our new relationship ; we both have that remarkable sense of belonging together . He loves my daughters and , miracle of miracles , they love him . Man , our friends even like one another . It 's as easy as breathing . Except in the kitchen . I 've always been the cook in my house . He 's always been the cook in his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , I notice something alarming . Neal 's sauce is perfect . My shrimp dish needs sherry . <p> We 've been together now for almost 11 years . Something surprising happened on the way to a long-term relationship : I learned how to become a sous-chef . <p> I remember a comment my therapist made when I told her about Neal . She had seen me through a divorce and into the beginning of a new relationship . She said , " I wonder what it will be like for you to be with someone who , is as competent as you . " <p> I mulled over that one . My ex-husband was certainly competent , a lawyer who started a software company he took public . But he did n't cook , he did n't fix things around the house , and come to think of it , he did n't help raise the kids . He ran his company . I ran my career , our family life , and our home  --  especially the kitchen : We were king and queen of our separate fiefdoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of modern love . <p> When Neal and I met , he was living in a 100-year-old Victorian house that he had renovated ( a man who fixes things ! ) . He 'd been a tax lawyer ( a man who pays bills on time ! ) and had quit to design and build furniture ( passion ! ) . I had joint custody of my then 9- and 11-year-old girls . <p> " OK , " Neal said in a heartbeat . " I 'll move to the Bay area . " <p> This guy was going to move for me ? So what if we bumped up against each other in the kitchen ? <p> Neal told me early on that if he was going to live with my girls , then he was going to play a part in raising them . Instead of bristling ( was n't it easier to make all those decisions myself ? ) , I found it a relief to share responsibility . I learned what it meant to have a partner in parenting  --  a remarkable concept . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On anything important , I never suspected him of " adding sherry " when I was out of the room . <p> Jump ahead a few years . I ask him what else he needs . Parsley . Got it , I say . You want tomatoes in this ? I ask . No tomatoes , he tells me . Garlic , half an onion , some wild mushrooms . Got it , I say . I chop , he stirs . <p> I 'm the sous-chef . He 's the chef . After enough years of poking around in his sauces , I figured out that he 's the intuitive cook ; I 'm the recipe follower . He invents . Toasted baguette with smoked trout , crme frache , sage in brown butter : Voil . I love my kitchen job , and often times it 's more " work " than his  --  I do all the prep work . He tosses things in a pan and the audience cheers . <p> We figured out the kitchen dance . And we 're rocking . <p> Which gets me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ? When I think back to my old life-when I was Queen of All Things Domestic-I remember the intense loneliness of the throne . Sure , everything got done my way . But I had no one to ask : Is that really the right way ? <p> This marriage does n't look a lot like that marriage . The sous-chef thing might sound like a hierarchy , but it 's got more to do with figuring out how two people work best together . Side by side .
