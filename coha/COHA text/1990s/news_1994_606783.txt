<p> THE DEMOCRATIC Party has emerged from the debacle of Nov. 8 trapped by a set of financial , demographic and geographic constraints that , in the near term , increase the likelihood that the party will remain in the minority . In the long term , these forces raise a far more ominous question : whether the Democratic Party can survive as a legitimate competitor in a two-party system . <p> These pressures will severely restrict Democratic strategists seeking to push the party to the center or right . At the same time , such constraints will increase the leverage of those who want the Democratic Party to be a left alliance of minorities , feminists , gays and labor dominated by public sector employee groups . <p> More importantly , the power of money , demography and geography , as well as cultural conflict , will interfere with the ability of the Democratic Party to regain credibility with the group that once stood at its core : the working and middle class  --  the essential component of a majority party . <p> While maintaining an alliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alienated middle America , moving far from its New Deal roots as the ally of such groups as European immigrants , Catholic ethnics , and organized labor seeking entry to the economic and social mainstream . Today , the party is increasingly seen by swing voters as seeking to redistribute income from workers to non-workers . And it is increasingly regarded as a party tolerant of values and programs undermining the two-parent family , while providing unintended but devastating disincentives for codes of personal responsibility as well as the work ethic . <p> Cleveland City Councilman Mike Polensek , who represents the northeast corner of the city , is just the kind of Democrat whose loyalties are strained by these trends . " It 's that old welfare mentality of gim me , gim me , gim me and blame everybody else for their plight or their problem , where , you know , I ca n't blame anybody . Those ethnic halls you saw in his district , we built them , nobody built them for us . These churches , we built them . There comes a point where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . If the whole city was like this neighborhood , there would be no problems . " <p> In this context , the growing conversion of the South , where attitudes similar to Polensek 's are commonplace , to a Republican bastion represents a loss to the Democratic Party not just of political support and of moderate to conservative House and Senate members used to running in biracial constituencies . The loss of the South is a blow to the solar plexus of the Democratic Party as a national party . <p> Without the South , and facing overt hostility throughout the region , Democratic presidential candidates can only make weakened claims to be fully national figures . <p> While Democrats are losing credibility as a national party , the GOP is making modest gains in reducing one of its central vulnerabilities : its failure to be a biracial party . The small increases in numbers of Republican black elected officials , including congressman-elect J.C . Watts ( R-Okla. ) and Boston 's new district attorney , Ralph C. Martin II , serve to effectively attack the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , pressures pushing the Democratic Party toward the left are likely to be reinforced by changes in the pattern of campaign contributions . For Democrats , the major moderate to conservative sources of cash have been from corporate and trade association political action committees . These groups have remained bipartisan in their giving patterns largely because House Democratic leaders used the power of the majority as both a carrot and stick to persuade business PACs that their interests would be served by making Democratic contributions . <p> Now the power of the majority no longer stands as a club over the business-trade association community . As a result , contributions are likely to fall significantly . <p> " It 's going to be painful , " said Dan McClung , who specializes in high-cost Democratic voter mobilization . " When Democrats had the majority , they business had to at least share the wealth . " <p> Larry O'Brien , a Democratic lawyer-lobbyist , was only slightly less pessimistic : " It wo n't dry up and go away , " he said , but business PAC money " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some adjustment . " Former congressman Tony Coelho , who helped build corporate support for Democrats during the early 1980s , contended that direct mail could improve and help make up for lost business donations , but he acknowledged that business backing will likely decline . <p> The importance of these financial sources is reflected in the most recent Federal Election Commission reports : From the start of 1993 through June 30 , 1994 , a total of $ 30.4 million , or more than half the total amount of PAC money received by Democrats , came from corporate and trade association committees . These PACs gave far less to Republican candidates , $ 19.6 million , a balance that is likely to shift radically in 1996 . <p> The effect of this will be ideological , as the loss of business and trade association PAC support will make Democrats increasingly dependent on labor  --  especially public employee unions ; private and non-profit service providers ; environmentalists ; gays ; Hollywood activists ; feminist groups ; and key immigrant lobbyists . <p> The 1994 to 1996 shift in financial patterns is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift of the House Democratic caucus , which has already been occurring as growing numbers of moderate and conservative Southern Democrats retire or are defeated . <p> These trends , culminating in the defeat of 1994 , will intensify a bitter civil war among Democrats over the ideological direction the party should take to regain competitive strength . Ideological commitments aside , however , there is a growing body of evidence that the 1994 setbacks resulted from angry center-right Democratic voters . <p> Comparing 1992 to 1994 voting patterns , major losses for the Democrats occurred among white men , especially those with just high school degrees whose economic futures are highly uncertain . They also took place among white Protestants and among those who see their standard of living declining . <p> The loss of support from white men  --  only 37 percent voted for Democratic candidates in ' 94  --  violates a core concept at the heart of the Democratic Party as the party of working people . White men are those experiencing the largest wage declines , the brunt of defense cutbacks and the dramatic attenuation of corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on crime , welfare reform and personal responsibility was overshadowed not only by the ominous moral implications of the Paula Jones and Whitewater controversies but also by administration policy initiatives : gays in the military , stringent diversity rules in federal appointments and a health care program viewed by poll respondents as forcing higher costs on the broad middle class in order to cover the uninsured . In addition , Clinton 's failed attempt to win approval in 1993 of a $ 20 billion economic stimulus package , and the pervasive charges in 1994 that his crime bill was laden with pork and counterproductive social spending , cost him and his party election day support among crucial voting constituencies . <p> An analysis of the pattern of Democratic House and Senate defeats conducted by three Stanford professors strongly suggests that crucial defections from the Democratic Party came from moderate to conservative voters angered by administration initiatives they saw as culturally liberal and economically redistributive . Such defectors also turned on senators and representatives who portrayed themselves , in the view of such voters , as centrists while building voting records in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituencies at home . David Brady , Douglas Rivers and John Cogan of Stanford found that there were two types of constituencies in which there were statistically significant Democratic losses . <p> The first were districts largely in the South and Midwest where Clinton 's margin of victory in 1992 was higher than Michael Dukakis 's in 1988 . In these centrist districts , voters were apparently disappointed with Clinton 's failure to live up to his promise to be a " New Democrat , " Brady said . <p> The second were relatively conservative districts in states where the Democratic incumbent stressed conservative themes while having liberal voting records . Sen. Jim Sasser ( D-Tenn. ) , for example , promoted school prayer while having a liberal Americans for Democratic Action rating in 1992 of 95 percent . " Those guys were hurt , " Brady said . <p> The severity of Democratic losses , then , can be attributed to moderate swing voters who felt betrayed either by Clinton , their own senator , their representative or all three . <p> All this leaves the Democratic Party in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolving cultural , social and economic conflict within the middle class and working class , and its financial base eroding . <p> The party has been in decline since the mid-term elections of 1966 , and the run of luck that helped stave off crisis  --  Watergate , the 1982 recession , the incompetence and cultural dissonances of the Bush administration  --  may have run its course . If so , the Democratic Party , like the British Labour Party , will have to resolve internal polarizing conflicts over values , rights , race and taxes or face the prospect of internecine warfare , ignominious election day returns and further collapse . <p> Thomas Edsall is a political reporter for The Washington Post and author of " Chain Reaction : The Impact of Race , Rights and Taxes on American Politics .
