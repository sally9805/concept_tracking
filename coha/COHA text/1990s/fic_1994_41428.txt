SHAKESPEARE AND GENDER : TOWARD A THEORY OF POPULAR CULTURAL MEDIATION . That Shakespeare serves the interests of class domination is not , however , the whole story ... <p> Much work has been done by British cultural materialists to uncover how Shakespeare 's plays and poetry are used to reconstitute ideologies of nation and class in England . Few studies , however , explore how Shakespeare is represented in contemporary popular culture to challenge or sustain hegemonic constructions of gender and sexuality . For cultural materialists , the impulse to situate Shakespeare in contemporary historical contexts stems from a progressive view-point challenging the traditional hegemonic practices that reproduce structural inequalities in British late capitalism . By analyzing the institutional settings that reproduce Shakespeare - from A- and O-Level entrance exams to the tourist centers in Stratford - these critics dig at the roots of a culture industry that exercises historically unprecedented power in the way it subjects the production of media to administrative classification and thus to the bureaucratic delimiting of sociopolitical thought . The point of such analysis is not merely to transform the terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the larger ideological process of political legitimation . <p> Within professional literary studies in the United States , however , the impulse to apply materialism to Shakespeare is usually channeled into interpretations of Renaissance culture . Outside of the United Kingdom , analyses of Shakespeare 's uses in the ideological apparatus of education , popular culture , and mass media are most likely to be found not in literary studies but in the fields of history , sociology , and popular culture . The reasons for this are manifold , the foremost being that , even today , with interest in noncanonical texts and divergent interpretive perspectives well integrated into the discipline of English professional merit and academic accreditation are still grounded in close readings of narratives . The cultural materialist approach to Shakespeare 's role in the American cultural industry will not claim to escape this professional ideology . Rather , it will advance close readings that link narratives to a wide range of critical discourses , " to describe the whole system of significations by which a society or a section of it understands itself and its relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are distinctively different from those in the U.K. makes British cultural materialism difficult to transfer to the American context . Popular political discourses in America are powerfully shaped by the institutionally sustained myth of social Darwinism , the lack of a third party , the continual loss of solidifying strategies among unions , and the mainstreaming of political issues by a conservative media unregulated by antitrust laws . Moreover , in England Shakespeare is a national monument : he is an icon inscribed with British nationalism . As an instrument of cultural hegemony , the English Shakespeare industry maintains an immediate relationship to the state . When cultural materialist critics historicize this industrial network - the tourist trade , theater , broadcasting , publishing , and education - they are taking a politically animated position that can enter into popular discourses and align itself with other reformative projects . In the United States , the cultural practices involved in reproducing Shakespeare are more stratified , and their relationship to the consolidation of political power is highly complex . <p> One book that has opened up this critical terrain is Michael Bristol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bristol documents what he calls the " hegemonization of Shakespeare , " the practice of enshrining Shakespeare 's work as " the embodiment of our cultural heritage , of western values and above all of western achievement . " At times Bristol 's account tends to ignore important social contradictions , so that the history of Shakespeare 's role as cultural capital in the development of contemporary political economy is at once totalized and totalizing . Bristol ignores the internal contradictions within discourses of cultural legitimacy , contradictions that are articulated around the margins of the story of Shakespeare 's iconization . <p> Specifically , Bristol overlooks how the categories of highbrow and lowbrow in American culture , particularly after the mass-media entertainment industry emerged , are class bound and have consistently been articulated in gendered terms . High culture is perceived in popular media both as transcendent , universal , and timeless , and as a refined and effete bookish culture , by implication domestic and " effeminate . " This curious ideological connection sets up complex mediations : any reference to Shakespeare meant to reconstitute the division of high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hegemony at the expense of exposing male heterosexual identity to destabilization . Bristol intuits that " hegemonic institutions are themselves built on contradictions " and " are peopled by social agents who themselves may have agendas that differ substantially " from dominant practices ( 61 ) . But he does not pursue the implications of this insight . If people have agendas that differ from hegemonic practices , then why paint a grim picture of infrastructures that hold " radical potentiality " in check ? The unintended effect of this narrative is to define academic conservatism as a conspiracy among librarians , editors , and critics , rather than as a symptom of a humanist ideology that shaped the thought of reactionary and leftist thinkers throughout the first half of the century . The site of agency for " radical potentiality " is precisely in those moments where the rigid hierarchical categories of social order ( differences of class , gender , sexual orientation , and race ) that cultural hegemony seeks to legitimate are not automatically resolved or naturalized . What these unstable sites mean is that representations of Shakespeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hegemony . Bristol suggests that they do when he cautions cultural analysts against optimism : the interests of " a critically motivated research program ... can not be actualized by a novel re-staging of the counter-normative script , nor simply by saying forbidden things about Shakespeare " ( 61 ) . Charting how Shakespeare is represented in popular culture will not release some awesome radical force , the great leap forward , but it will show that there are spaces to signify difference , outside the purview of an all-containing cultural hegemony . <p> Let us start with a recent television commercial , which used an image of Shakespeare in ways that were , on the surface , not too surprising . This advertisement for beer shows two male roommates calling up two women and asking them over to drink . The guys ' place is a mess , so they quickly tidy up . The commercial gives us a montage of images : young men bonding by cleaning their apartment ; young women doing their hair , preparing for the evening . The men cleverly misrepresent their lifestyle : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poster of a scantily clad model , snuggling cold bottles of beer , is turned over . On the other side is a picture of Shakespeare . The women arrive and are impressed with the pad . <p> This commercial plays on a constructed image of Shakespeare as high art , but it also introduces an interesting and dynamic semiotic . Consider the poster as presenting two versions of masculinity , each a construct of consumer culture . On one side , the woman 's submissive and seductive pose is a sign of heterosexual desire . But the poster also serves as a sign of consumerism and its dominant form in popular art , a frank acceptance of mass-produced representations . No Monet or Cezanne adorns the walls of this apartment , only the photo-glitz of some dorm-room aesthetic . Through montage , this poster is juxtaposed to images of the women readying themselves at the mirror . These women , too , it suggests , will soon be objects of desire . The semiotic kinesis is nearly transparent : satiating sexual desire is like quenching a thirst . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swept under the rug , the commercial suggests , by highbrow pretense . When the poster is turned over , Shakespeare 's picture becomes an ambivalent sign . He comes to signify high culture and something else : male sexuality reconfigured by the aura of art , no longer an icon of unabashed heterosexual desire . When the poster girl is turned over , so is male sexuality . <p> The idea of high culture is dependent upon a set of cultural binaries : it is disinterested , refined , abstracted , a realm of intellection as opposed to bodily needs . The gendered terms attendant to these binaries are easily mapped out . An emotional world disinterested in the material workaday matters of production is feminine . As Terry Eagleton suggests passingly in Literary Theory , English literature had just such a " feminine aspect " to it , because it appeared " an untaxing sort of affair , concerned with the finer feelings rather than with the more virile topics of bona fide academic disciplines ' ... a convenient sort of non-subject to palm off on the ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the professions . " <p> The residue of an effeminate literary world , signified in our beer commercial as Shakespeare , is employed to further the ends of male desire by helping the guys score . But the complex signifying system that upholds such desire potentially disarms its own certainty : the girl in the bikini must be turned over , ultimately , as if to renounce the identity that she signifies . In appropriating high culture in this fashion , the commercial opens up a terrain that refigures the sign of Shakespeare as something outside , in uneasy alliance with , or in excess of heterosexuality . <p> This is the dynamic I would like to explore in the following pages . When used in American popular culture to legitimate a narrative or a product , the sign of Shakespeare often appears attending images of cross-dressing , feminization , or emasculation . I want to consider the history behind this ambiguous semiotic process . How might Shakespeare serve the function of reconstituting highbrow/lowbrow distinctions while at the same time introducing disruptive contexts that articulate a crisis of signification in dominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Culture <p> The most thorough account of Shakespeare 's role in the American culture industry is Lawrence Levine 's Highbrow/Lowbrow : The Emergence of Cultural Hierarchy in America . For those invested in cultural materialism and in critiquing the humanist impulse that aligns the Bard 's universal voice with the populist " will of the people , " Levine 's cultural history is an embarrassment , because it charts how Shakespeare 's drama was at one time at the center of American entertainment . <p> Levine begins his narrative : " Shakespeare was performed not merely alongside popular entertainment as an elite supplement to it ; Shakespeare was popular entertainment in nineteenth-century America . " Levine 's narrative describes the carnivalesque format that Shakespeare 's plays assumed on the popular stage . Whittled down and edited into fragmented set-pieces , the plays typically opened for speciality acts , farces , and burlesques . As You Like It was advertised in Philadelphia in 1839 to be followed by the gymnastic spectacle of the Antonio brothers - " a most magnificent display of position in the Science of Gymnastics ... to conclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a dancer , and a storyteller ( 21 ) . Actors sang popular songs before , after , and sometimes during the plays . These " divertisements " did not " dilute or denigrate Shakespeare , " Levine suggests ; " they may be understood more meaningfully as having integrated him into American culture . Shakespeare was presented as part of the same milieu inhabited by magicians , dancers , singers , acrobats , minstrels , and comics . He appeared on the same playbills and was advertised in the same spirit " ( 23 ) . <p> Shakespeare did not become high culture until the latter part of the century when theater shifted its organizing structure from that " characterized by local stock companies , permanently attached to a specific theater , " to " combination companies , which generally were organized in New York City ... a national booking system which ultimately functioned as a national theatrical monopoly " ( 78 ) . This centralization was a decisive shift in the formation of American mass culture . The businessmen who managed the new theater chains and huge booking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the conviction that an unbridgeable gulf separated the tastes and predilections of the various socioeconomic groups , and with the belief that Shakespeare was highbrow ' culture of little interest to the masses and therefore of slight potential profit to producers . ( 79 ) <p> Levine 's narrative is indispensable to analysis of the history that has determined the highbrow/lowbrow distinctions so familiar in modern culture . After this shift , Shakespeare 's plays were produced in full length , by " legitimate " acting companies , with careful attention to the universal-art-text as scholars conceived it . When the theater industry needed an argument for a " proper " Shakespeare , it could appropriate the romantic view that inscribed literary experience with the petit-bourgeois tastes and values of university and literary club settings . Only then did the concept of Shakespeare as " literature " became dominant . In this sense , the scholastic approach to Shakespeare was a social practice mediated by larger economic changes . When A. A. Lipscomb announced in 1882 that Shakespeare had " ascended to a new and higher sphere in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college and university , and even more the Shakespeare of private and select culture , " he was legitimizing a hierarchical concept of culture and supporting the institutional appropriation of the plays by a refined , elite sector of society . " Shakespeare , " Lipscomb concluded . " Will not be perfectly himself and perfectly at home anywhere else " ( Levine 73 ) . <p> Levine 's narrative also attests to the lack of valence between popular productions of Shakespeare and the humanist discourse invested in S.T. Coleridge 's romantic revision of Shakespeare as an organic genius . Levine 's story is about the cultural plundering of a popular art form , and it suggests that the romantic conceptions of art still pervasive in our own era did not become dominant until a centralized theater industry needed to justify its control over a new Shakespeare . How could literature be adored for its inherent , organic properties , experienced intellectually as well as emotionally , how could it be preserved , in carnivalesque treatments ? How could one admire the organic genius behind Hamlet 's soliloquy , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seals ? If Shakespeare 's works were to be that cherished mirror of Nature , they would have to be played in proper cathedrals of reverence on what Lipscomb calls a " private and select " stage . <p> Levine appears to romanticize Shakespeare 's impact on the lives of people before the shift from public to private theater companies . A more critical view would be that Shakespeare was mediated differently in the burlesque contexts of public entertainment in nineteenth-century America . His plays were not conjoined organically with a **26;262;TOOLONG " populace " ; rather they were treated outside of the discourse of high art as malleable texts with which to represent ideological positions typically shut out of " high-cultural " perceptions of literature . Local religious sentiments , racism , and regionalism often provided the framework . When we read that a New Orleans performance of Richard III was accompanied by " a new and original Patriotic Drama in 3 Acts ... ( founded on events which have occurred in the Mexican War ) &; called : Palo Alto ... triumph of American arms ! ... Grand Military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " an act of Hamlet , one from Black-Eyed Susan , and sung A Yankee Ship and a Yankee Crew ' and danced a hornpipe , and wound up with a nigger ' part , all in one night , " we are witnessing Shakespeare 's plays being made to fit within the ideological frameworks of a host of social groups and political camps . <p> Moreover , Levine 's historical narratives does not say simply that Shakespeare went from " lowbrow " to " highbrow . " On the contrary , it suggests that in late nineteenth-and early twentieth-century America , Shakespeare 's plays were instrumental in the construction of theses categories . Theoretically it would seem coherent to say that once Shakespeare was wrested from the hands of the " unscrupulous " and " uneducated " whose melodramatic appropriations of his plays bordered on an anarchic atmosphere of ritual farce , he would be made to voice a monological viewpoint , a single life vision . But the opposite is the case . Paradoxically , Shakespeare was inscribed as a private practice on the grounds of a humanist idealization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideology serves a specific misrecognition : Shakespeare 's " universal appeal " is trumpeted in a way that masks his privatization . For my purposes , what is important is how this timeless quality and universalism was ascribed to high culture with a definite gender binary . Edging Women Out : the Private , Effete Culture of Literature <p> Was Shakespeare the object of critical concern in universities during the shift from public to private theater ? According to Gerald Graff , English literature was not introduced into college curricula until the middle of the nineteenth century , and then only as an experiment . The classroom practice of interpretation was fashioned after classical rhetoric . To recite passages of English literature out loud , as if they were Latin or Greek , was to learn the immeasurably practical skill of public speaking and debating . Rhetoric eventually gave way to philology in the new professional era after the Civil War ( 36-43 ) . But the interpretive strategy we associate with the humanist-universalist perception of the experience of literature - a passive subjective reflex or an inner contemplation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American colleges until the 1890s . If one wanted to find Shakespeare appreciated in this way before the rise of what Graff calls " Generalism , " one would turn to the literary clubs , most of which were women 's organizations . <p> Graff claims that English literature was not taught in the late-nineteenth-century academy because , " since modern languages and literatures were considered mere social accomplishments , they were looked upon as feminine preoccupations " ( 37 ) . Women were allowed to study literature because it was considered not to threaten ideals of domesticity . Moreover , Graff implies that the emergence of the profession of literature as a science - the philological study of language as its own topic of discourse - developed out of this gendered context . " This reputation for effeminacy , " Graff explains , " would have to be effaced from the modern languages before they could become respectable in the university . One of the attractions of Germanic philology would be that as a hard science its manliness was not in question " ( 30 ) . Graff suggests that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory of sublimation to account for the sexual politics that subtend the development of the research model in the academy . But this narrative tends to naturalize the gender binary , depending on rather than questioning the historically constituted binary that literature is feminine and science is masculine . <p> Though most colleges had literary societies , by far the most popular kind of society was the women 's club . By the turn of the century , some five thousand local clubs had joined the General Federation of Women 's Clubs , " and it has been estimated that they constituted only five to ten percent of the clubs in existence . " Women 's societies are the most overlooked phenomenon in literary history . As institutions that promoted literary culture within the ranks of middle-class America , they served as semi-autonomous and highly regulated organizations for the enculturation of disempowered , domesticated women to worldly views and sentiments . They thus played a valuable role in the dissemination of cultural capital to a sector of society that had been inexorably shut out from the sphere of white-collar meritocracy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but most specialized in literature and art . Because schedules were built upon previous work of members , some of the lecture programs culminated in distinct curricula that rivaled college course offerings in their particularities . The Chicago Women 's Club , for instance , prepared in advance a year program on English drama . The first year took the group through the middle of Shakespeare 's career ; the second year to the close of the Elizabethan period ; and the third , after a brief review of Restoration and seventeenth-century drama , emphasized the various dramatic developments of the present era .... The design was to illustrate the growth of dramatic art by a series of selected plays a Shakespeare , studied in comparison with some other work or works of the period , and considered as a exponent of the growth of Shakespeare 's mind and art . ( Martin 103 ) <p> Many historians see the nineteenth-century literary club as an important stage in the development of the women 's movement , as well as the locus for the evolution of feminist sensibilities and women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's literary clubs . Many simply entitled themselves " Shakespeare club , " implying that any literary scholarly pursuit may as well begin with his work . Shakespeare was studied with a keen eye to the development of his craft , to biographical history , and to comparisons with other classical and modern writers . Within the urbane environment of the literary club , appreciation of Shakespeare as an embodiment of all that the Renaissance stood for went hand in hand with philanthropic public service , to which some clubs devoted themselves with equal seriousness . Mary Wood , a clubwoman and later a historian , explains the spirit of emancipation at the heart of those clubs and the role the Renaissance held in fostering this spirit : The club movement is a simple phase of the whole scheme of evolution , a natural result of the readjustment necessary to the great economic and moral awakening of the late Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries . The germ of its existence may be found as far back as the Renaissance , which placed the first emphasis upon the value of the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teleological narrative inscribes individuality as a natural state of existence toward which human evolution is unfolding . But she is using an ideology of liberal universality to stress an equality that is now , in the nineteenth century , only dimly felt . Like Matthew Arnold , Wood understands literary experience , particularly that of Renaissance literature , to be very much tied to what she calls " moral awakening . " We remember that , when searching for a proper set of texts to elevate us from our sullied class positions , Arnold turns to Renaissance Neo-Platonism . It is the transcendence of Renaissance literature that may save us from our own riotous assertions of identity by allowing us to envision how we all share an ideal self . We can then leave our petty material histories at the door and enter the sublime world of liberal culture . <p> Today we understand that this ideology means to mystify real social relations by making us identity with the bourgeois subject , whose liberty is purchased at the expense of others inextricably bound up in competitive social relations not of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social sphere , the Renaissance - the idea of a universal individualism - helped establish a cultural imaginary wherein women saw themselves in a larger history - as Wood claims , a larger history of emancipation - and to envision themselves as participants in this unfolding . <p> Given that clubs shaped the context in which a major portion of Americans could approach and understand Shakespeare as " art , " we are compelled to recognize that the discourse defined a " literature " during this time emerges in the highly contested arena of sexual politics . Theodora Penny Martin explains that women 's clubs were under fire for their " inferior " and " shallow " attempts at mimicking intellectual acumen . According to Martin , most criticism leveled at literary clubs stemmed from a fear that women were overstepping their bounds . Today we may recognize , in public satires of the overly aspiring , " affected " woman of the literary society , a not-too-subtle process of representing women scholars as " others , " an attempt on the part of the cultural establishment to disparage a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Such epithets also suggest the complexly gendered role that educational discourses played in the American class aspirations of the Gilded Age . When Dr. John Gregory advised his daughters , " If you have any learning , keep it a profound secret , especially from men , who generally look with a jealous and malignant eye on a woman of great parts and cultivated understanding , " he was revealing a woman 's dubious position in a class-bound society that touted cultivation as a sign of success . Yet patriarchal ideology easily appropriated the image of woman as bearer of high culture . The cult of domesticity rewrote the woman 's maternal role as " mother of civilization , " and when " white , middle-class , Protestant women " were urged " to fulfill their mission by becoming schoolteachers on the western frontier , men welcomed them with open arms , so to speak " ( Tuchman 13 ) . The call for women to fulfill their mission in such ancillary professions as schoolmarm is a poignant reminder of the deep gender divisions from which women 's literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so successful at their intellectual inquiries , they did overstep the bounds of their so-called natural gifts of piety and modesty ; the clubs came to signify the bourgeois ideals of achievement and accomplishment , and thus to occupy a masculine space in the cultural imaginary of popular discourses . The woman 's club was so popular that it became the object of derision in academic circles as well as in the popular press . Club members were routinely satirized as being " strong-minded " and " becoming mannish and losing the charms of womanhood ' " ( Martin 120 ) . Response to feminine pretension was part of a larger ideological operation , according to sociologist Gaye Tuchman , who argues that women were edged out of the publishing industry near the end of the nineteenth century . Edging Women Out documents the way women were excised from " production " and " consumption " of novels , which had been largely a female literary culture . By developing an aesthetic of the author - a consecrated ( male ) genius whose works could be marketed as guaranteed successes - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the random solicitation of amateur female novelists . Pound for pound , the new system was easier to manage and pay for than the intricately layered older process of publishing unknown novice writers , whose work 's success depended on an elaborate writer-agent-publisher relationship and a large population of subscribing women readers . <p> Shakespeare is inscribed as an aesthetic object , placed on the " legitimate " stage away from the reach of public farce , during a time of dynamic shifts in cultural production - between private and public theater , between women 's literary culture and the professional academy , and between anonymous serialized romance novels and the emerging publishing industry - changes that in turn determined the relationship literature grew to have with popular culture . Patriarchal ideology insists on shutting out women from its public sphere , thus constructing private domestic space as feminine space . Yet in order to disparage a collective form of aesthetic production , the literary club , patriarchy had potentially to undermine its own ideology of universal experience by exposing high culture as effete , originating in the uptown parlors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesperson for a transcendent Man when the practice of appreciating his works was attributed to the " mannish " wives and daughters of the petit bourgeoisie.As a sign for high culture , Shakespeare inherits this contradiction in the form of a confused and ambiguous textual/sexual play . In the cultural imaginary of the mass-produced texts of popular entertainment , Shakespeare is reproduced to stand for culture , but sometimes he does so in a way that attests to the contradictory history from which this term emerges : the discursive contest between the literary society and the university , between a shallow , effete art appreciation and a sincere professional one , and between the feminine private domesticated culture and the logocentric transcendent artpiece . When Shakespeare is reproduced as a high-cultural apparatus in postindustrial America , his icon must be negotiated . Because cultivation via literature was an act associated with pretension and feminine self-empowerment , popular entertainment has had to code his work in such a way as to distance itself from marks of femininity . The history of this cultural contest is indelibly inscribed in reproductions of and references @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my surprise when I got your call . Alvie : I had a feeling I got you at a bad moment . You know , I heard high-pitched squealing . Max : Twins . Sixteen-year olds . Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities of that ? Alvie : You 're an actor , Max . You should be doing Shakespeare in the park . Max : Oh , I did Shakespeare in the park . I got mugged . I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotards . <p> The history of this semiological process can be traced to the beginning of twentieth-century popular culture , in the reviews of Shakespeare 's introduction to mass entertainment , Max Reinhardt 's and William Dieterle 's A Midsummer Night 's Dream ( 1935 ) . Released in huge theaters rather than movie houses , this movie was appropriately singled out by Time magazine as belonging to a confused physical and semiological space : it " will be exhibited throughout the U.S. in theaters usually used for legitimate productions rather than in cinemansions , impressively brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies " ( Levine 53 ) . The New Yorker went further to imply that Shakespeare would be best left to these societies : " Culture groups will be happy as bees . " The New Republic provides the best evidence of the gendered conflict that accompanies this uncharted space of Shakespeare outside of the feminine space of the literary club and on the screen of mass production : " At its many screenings there will be no lack of Ah 's and Oh 's , culture clubs will have discussions , newspaper critics will put on their Sunday adjectives ; but ... there is going to be a powerful minority of American husbands who will get one load of the elves and pixies and feel betrayed " ( Levine 53 ) . Combined with disquiet over Shakespeare 's presence in mass culture is a statement about the sexual affinity of Dieterle 's artistically ethereal production . Shakespeare , as a universal-art-text , is served to a popular audience , but its high-cultural origins bear a trace of femininity . The writer reacts to the director 's vision with a common-sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been describing , wherein the terms of bourgeois universalism must disavow a private , feminine other . At the heart of humanist-idealist discourse is an anxious semiotic activity that insists on reproducing a difference between universal literature and the private/feminine , a nervous repudiation within the popular imaginary of the historical inscription of a feminized culture . <p> Thus far , my analysis of Shakespeare as a complex symbol for the history of women 's literary clubs depends upon the critical discourse of structuralism , which defines language not as a way for conscious agents to refer mimetically to objects in the world , but as a mediating system , a set of representations that determine the speaker 's range of relationships to the social world . This definition of language as a system that prefigures the speaker assumes that " in language , as in any semiological system , whatever distinguishes one sign from the others constitutes it . Difference makes character as it makes value and the sign unit . " The illusory inherent or " essential " value of objects in the perceived world is a function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manly " and " effeminate " are signs that have meaning and value because of a host of other signs that , by association , give them meaning in a larger social economy of communicable codes . And because language is a practice , not a static system , these codes must constantly reproduce themselves . The differences must be established and reestablished by real speakers in historically situated social positions in a hierarchy of power relations . I agree with Judith Butler when she identifies gender as a practice , an effect of an act that must be learned and internalized by a social " actor . " However , I do not think the metaphor or theater - gender as " act " - adequately deals with theoretical problems of power in language . The degree to which the actor has the agency to recreate for herself the effect of gender is greater than the power she has to recreate the system established by larger institutions ( conservative straight media , fundamentalist religious discourses , psychological and medical discourses ) that intend o represent " gender trouble " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the illusory essential category of gender is extremely limited : one person 's act can quite easily be turned into the establishment 's sideshow ( as the seemingly limitless fascination with the " scandal " of gender trouble is represented in shows like " Geraldo " , for example ) . <p> My narrative above suggests that the sign for high culture , Shakespeare , is constituted on an associative chain that presupposes an entire series of different signs : affluence , authority , cultivation , effete , effeminate , mannish women . But these are not fixed units . They are signifying terms in an ongoing and highly contradictory form of discursive production . Shakespeare can be invoked in an act of cultural licensing to stamp with approval any particular claim to truth . In " You base football player ! ' : Shakespeare in Contemporary Popular Culture , " Derek Longhurst describes this sign as " a dominant figuration ... articulated around Shakespeare 's texts as embodiments of literary genius constituted in a coalescence of the flowing ' of the English language and the ( consequent ? ) universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in popular texts can paradoxically provide a site for cultural contest , where such an image is exposed to ridicule , parody , and satire . Such gestures depend upon the semiological chain in order to put forth visions that are " **47;318;TOOLONG ... progressively subversive because they appeal to genuine ' popular pleasures of a complacent bourgeois culture " ( 68 ) . The codes that fix Shakespeare along the chain of high-cultural signs are present " in the wings " of references to his plays , and actually set up the possibility of subverting these signs through a process coined " the popular grotesque , ' constituted through the displacement of the cultural identity and texts ' of Shakespeare into disruptive and even anarchic performance contexts " ( 68 ) . <p> Longhurst 's analysis emphasizes the class-striated texture of the sign " Shakespeare . " My own narrative accounts for the social category of gender as an important element of textual production of highbrow culture .

This semiotic association resides in what Raymond Williams calls residual ideology : significations and values that have been formed in the past but can not be articulated in the dominant culture . The contradictions attendant to Shakespeare as both a universal art text and an effeminate , effete literary object come to form a highly collusive , unstable moment of representation through which one can read how contemporary ideologies of art and gender are hierarchically mapped . <p> What can sometimes attend the sign of Shakespeare is an act of exorcism , usually a series of representations that mocks the connection between highbrow culture and femininity . Film criticism might call such anarchic moments extra-diegetic instances , where the narrative falters , skips a beat , and disturbs its own flow to work upon the associative chain that underpins the high-cultural image of Shakespeare . These moments usually translate into instances of homophobic farce , and fixate on and reproduce stereotypical associations between theatrical and homosexual culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous parody of the cultural origins of artistic sensibilities . A macho Fonzie in tights acts the role of Hamlet ; Gilligan sings " To be or not to be , this is the question that I ask of me " while other male castaways dance in drag . In the camp " Batman " television series , we witness in each episode the aristocrat turned detective , Bruce Wayne , and his faithful ward Dick Gracin , a.k.a. " the boy wonder , " reach for a hidden toggle switch in the bust of the Bard to open the doors to their bat cave . The bust serves as a miracle stone that transforms our armchair detectives , complete with smoking jackets , into caped crusaders , leotards and all . Take the rather arbitrary example of the sequel Highlander 2 : The Quickening ( 1991 ) , a sci-fi thriller starring Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery . In one scene , the immortal Scottish clansman , Ramirez , played by Connery , is magically transported to Earth 2024 and materializes in the middle of a production of Hamlet : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Horatio ... Ramirez : Actually , the name is Ramirez . Actor : ( Whispers ) Will you get our of here ! ... Here hung those lips I have kissed I know not how oft ... Ramirez : Sir , whatever you gentlemen felt for each other when your friend was still alive is certainly none of my business .... <p> Ramirez 's accidental appearance in the middle of Hamlet certainly leads to the kind of anarchic disturbance that Longhurst has identified in the popular texts of consumer culture . But in additional to Shakespeare being subjected to mild derision , there is a seemingly gratuitous reference to homosexuality . Images of Shakespeare in proximity to images like these of cross-dressing or homosocial farce suggest that hegemonic reproductions of Shakespeare are not , as Bristol argues , merely ideological maneuvers to consecrate high culture . <p> To tell the long history of popular cultural references to Shakespeare would require a more precise catalogue , and my model would shift its emphasis at different historical periods to define precisely how images of sexual ambiguity function ideologically to represent masculine identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall , for example , Max 's sexual escapades with underaged women emerge as a binary opposite of what he should be doing instead : " Shakespeare in the park . " This invocation of Shakespeare is followed by a reference to male emasculation - two men in leather jackets stole his leotards . The context is that Max has forsaken real intellectual and artistic endeavor , " real writing , " in urban Manhattan to write television shows in Beverly Hills . Max : I want you to see my house . I live right next to Hugh Hefner 's house ... and the women , they 're like the women in Playboy magazine only they can move their arms and legs ... Annie : I ca n't get over this is really Beverly Hills ! Alvie : Yeah , the architecture 's really consistent , is n't it ? French next to Spanish next to Tudor next to Japanese . Annie : God , it 's so clean out here . Alvie : That 's because they do n't throw their garbage away , they make it into television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitsch , the heart of Hollywood 's eclectic soup of architectural parodies : cul-de-sacs of mock - Tudors next to Spanish next to Rococo , a land that Umberto Eco saw as the quintessential example of the crechification of culture , where copies of the European or " traditional " real provide such an illusory sensation that the real Real begins to look like a cheap imitation . But Max also lives in a space where his masculinity is affirmed , a space marvelously innocent of artistic pretensions , free from Alvie 's concert for artistic unity and literary achievement . Later , it does not surprise us when Alvie invokes Shakespeare as an alternative to Max 's devotion to popular entertainment . In proximity to the binary references to highbrow elitism and lowbrow " garbage " are neurotic affirmations of male heterosexual virility , as if when the sign Shakespeare is summoned , male heterosexuality must immediately reconfirm itself . <p> These anarchic signifying moments - the reckless spinning off of a constellation of tried-and-true images of the emasculated , sexually ambivalent male - can now best be understood as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespeare of its embarrassingly feminine cultural history and , in search of ideological closure , to employ the universalist rhetoric of high culture with a kind of guarded sprezzatura . I am not arguing that this is a synchronic zero-sum formula , which maintains a transhistorical regularity . Rather , as an integral aspect of a modern , popular imagination , the sign-chain that accounts for this semiotic residue is consistently conjured into discourse and reworked , repatterned , and rearticulated at different historical junctures in the twentieth century not only to voice the anxious proximity of bourgeois idealism to feminine culture , but also to display the unstable and contradictory discourses of masculine identity in contemporary consumer capitalism . Consecrating the Bard : The Goodbye Girl <p> I want to end with a reading of Neil Simon 's The Goodbye Girl ( 1977 ) , directed by Herbert Ross and starring Marsha Mason and Richard Dreyfuss . This movie was produced by Ray Stark , a Hollywood financier of the sixties and seventies , who virtually made Barbra Streisand into an industry by introducing her to film . The Stark-Ross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broadway play The Sunshine Boys in 1975 , so they again produced Simon - one of his first made-for-film romances . Simon 's story proves a good example for my purposes because , like most of his work , it occupies a curious space between the highbrow setting of Broadway and the mass-media world of popular culture . Simon 's self-conscious and farcical treatment of the New York theater industry foregrounds this ambiguous relationship . The Goodbye Girl is about a down-and-out New York dancer and single mother , Paula McFadden ( Mason ) , whose apartment is sublet behind her back to a young actor from Chicago , Elliot Garfield ( Dreyfuss ) . Because she needs the money and he has too much heart to kick them out , they compromise by sharing the apartment . Elliot has come to New York to play in an off-off-Broadway production of Shakespeare 's Richard III : this is his chance to make it in theater . <p> The staging of Shakespeare in this film allows Simon to poke fun at the intellectual culture of off-Broadway theater , a climate represented as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unproductive bohemians whose high-cultural pretensions have blinded them to the true purpose of entertainment . This world is suspiciously effeminate . At the first rehearsal Elliot and the other actors are introduced to the show 's patron , " the wise and rich Miss Stella Morganweiss , " something of a hold-over symbol of the literary club woman . The director tells the actors that he wants to do away with the " conventional " Richard : Director : Is that the way we want to play Richard ? If you do , then this director would just as well do a six-month stint on the Sonny and Cher show .... Richard III was a flaming Homosexual , so was Shakespeare for that matter . But that angry mob at the Globe theater was n't going to pump down two shillings to see a bunch of pansies jumping about on the stage . It was society that crippled Richard , not childhood . I mean , read your text . He sent those two cute little boys up to the tower and nobody saw them again . Oh , we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of the hump , get rid of the twisted deformities , and show him as he would be today , the queen who wanted to be a king . Elliot : Are you serious ? Director : What 's the objection Elliot ? ... How do you see Richard ? Mister macho , is that it ? Elliot : No , look : I do n't think the guy 's a linebacker for the Chicago Bears . But lets not throw away one of his prime motivations . Director : What 's that ? Elliot : He wants to hump Lady Anne ! Director : Yes , I 've heard that before . <p> Simon represents the active director as irrationally affected ; anyone who reads into the text resides in the sexually ambivalent culture of highbrow pretension . Mark , the director , has a mother complex . After the lamentable debut , he is seen back stage begging his mother for approval . He shouts : " Everybody ! Everybody ! She loved it , my mother loved it ! " Mark represents as the alternative to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same chain of male heterosexual identity as " Mister macho , " " linebacker for the Chicago Bears , " " humping Lady Anne . " The impulse of the farce plays upon Shakespeare 's sign coterminous with sexual ambivalence and ridicules the perversity of a theatrical environment that would think to produce Richard as a " queen who wanted to be king . " Simon is consecrating the Bard , saving him from the likes of Mark and " the wise and rich " Miss Morganwiess , a pathetic character who is the only member in the audience to applaud after the performance : " So exciting , thrilling ! It is so contemporary ! Bravo ! Bravo ! " <p> Elliot 's camp rendition of Richard relies on stock images of the limp-wristed , lispy homosexual . The romp through tired , homophobic cliches provides Simon 's vaudeville humor with countless setups . During the initial rehearsals , Elliot breaks down : Elliot : My careereth is over , I 'm making a horseth asseth of myself . Mark , I 'm begging you . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne ! Mark : You 're unhappy Elliot ? Elliot : Unhappy , no . I 'm freaking petrified . The critics are going to crucify me . And gay liberation is going to hang me from Shakespeare 's statue by my genitalia . You got ta help me ! Mark : What do you want ? Elliot : I want my hump back , I want my club foot ! I want a little paralysis in my right hand ... Mark : I see , you want to play it safe , huh ? You want to give us your standard conventional Richard . Well , I ca n't argue with that , Elliot , they 've been doing it that way for four hundred years ! Elliot : What do I know , I 'm lucky to get the part . I come from Chicago , we do things a little differently out there . We do the play as written . That does n't go over in New York , terrific ! ... I 'm not a quitter . You want me to do Richard III like Tatum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me look foolish out there ! <p> Here the theme of success becomes evident . Lucky to get the part , Elliot acquiesces to Mark 's interpretation because he wants to make it big , climb the social ladder . But succeeding ironically carries with it the threat of physical emasculation , Literal images of castration . Gay liberation will " hang him by his genitalia . " So strong is the theme of success , some critics found in the very style of Simon 's wit a headlong drive to turn any moment into a vehicle for rapid-fire wisecracks . Vincent Canby 's formalism , for example , allows him to characterize the movie as " the perfect American comedy for an age in which opportunism is not only an acceptable way of getting a head in the world , but also a fashionable style of conversation , patterned largely , I suspect , on the manners of television talk-show guests who trample one another for the camera 's attention . It 's as if Zsa Zsa Gabor had become our Euphues . " Though Canby is concerned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important psychological tension in Simon 's writing . Simon 's flair for verbal repartee is as theatrical and intellectual as the dramatic culture he parodies . His own penchant for flippant dialogue occupies an ideological space in the popular imaginary not too distant from camp theater : the self-profiting characters may be representing the deeply felt anxiety of a writer who must take the position of Shakespeare and all that this sign carries with it . ( Consider Simon 's Biloxi Blues ( 1988 ) , an autobiography about an aspiring writer called Shakespeare by his boot camp buddies . The main character is the only one in the platoon who can communicate with the effeminate , intellectual pacifist , who is suspected of homosexuality ) . <p> The ideology of The Goodbye Girl reproduces , as do other films made during the 1970s , the terms of a crisis in the institution of family . The mother Paula and her daughter Lucy need a man in the home : without him , the household will not be complete . And Elliot 's ability to succeed is paradoxically dependent on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , he must play " an Elizabethan fruitfly ... the Betty Boop of Stratford on Avon . " His success as an actor , and as bread winner , is actually impeded by the effete culture of off-Broadway . Simon plays up the tension in a crucial scene when Paula , who has been rejecting Elliot 's advance throughout the movie , realizes that she is attracted to him . At the moment when his new-found love could be consummated , Elliot suffers an identity crisis : Paula : Is anything wrong ? Elliot : Wrong ? Nothing 's wrong ! What makes you think anything 's wrong ? Nothing 's Wrong ! You open with Richard III in front of all the New York critics tomorrow night wearing a chartreuse hump on your back . You play Richard with a crippled paralytic hand and pink polish on your nails ! I 'm trying to save my god-damned career , that 's what 's wrong ! <p> In The Goodbye Girl Shakespeare is indeed a sign for elitism , pretension , authority , and establishment . But the farcical moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to ridicule or anarchic derision . The audience is clearly placed on Elliot 's side : we want him to succeed , to save his career , become a good actor . Shakespeare is the pinnacle of dramatic aspiration , and in ordinary circumstances , the movie makes clear , Elliot would achieve his break and acquire professional status . The movie reproduces the hegemonic ideology of social ascent ; it is possible , in spite of evidence , to better one 's class position . However , Shakespeare is also a sign for effeminate culture , and thus his nominally accepted image as an icon for high art - what one would aspire to experience , learn , and know - is complicated References to Shakespeare in this film are something of a culmination of the semiological process I have described above . Rather than simply reassert his sexual identity , Elliot succumbs to the weight of the sign . He must relent and play out in his mannerisms on the stage the host of historically rich , contradictory associations that come with Shakespeare . In the context of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male dominance , the comic scenes of Elliot parading around on stage with his chartreuse hump , clubfoot , gimp hand , and lisp figure as allegories of a male heterosexual identity in paralysis . <p> There are instance , not just in biographical treatments of the sonnets but in film , where the connections between Shakespeare and sexual ambivalence are more openly attended to . Derek Jarman 's The Angelic Conversation , for example , is a gay film that sets hypnotic , stop-motion video-art to Judi Dench 's reading of the sonnets . The power of Jarman 's work to scandalize relies precisely on Shakespeare 's residing in a complex space in the popular imagination where the high-art iconography of Elizabethan culture seems both to renounce and to beg for active recontextualization of its ambiguities . According to Marjorie Garber , Shakespeare has always functioned as a cultural space for gender to be staged . The long history of cross-dressing in productions of Shakespeare form the last century to the present provides Garber a paradigm for a publicity accepted transvestite theater , a theater " that recognizes that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturalness to the sign of sexuality , " she continues , " is exactly what great theater puts in question . In other words , there is no ground of Shakespeare that is not already cross-dressed . " <p> As we have seen , the historical determinations of this sexually ambiguous sign date back to the emergence of high culture in America , when private culture was seen to be effeminate because of the popularity of women 's clubs . A more complete history of the various representations of the gendered highbrow/lowbrow structures in popular culture would entail an understanding of the development of camp and its relation to earlier vaudeville versions of sexual play , which in turn may account for the anxious representations in film and elsewhere of the stages as a sexually ambivalent space . My own account of this process reveals that , as a sign in contemporary popular culture , Shakespeare is often used to produce discursive distinctions between " high " and " low " in cultural production , while such allusions also attempt to renounce , through sexual parody , the longstanding semiotic residue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parody suggest that the cultural hegemony that Shakespeare is used to sustain may be less than all-containing and immutable . Because of the real context in which highbrow grew to be distinct from lowbrow - that is , due to the way literature emerged as a social labor distinct from popular modes - an analysis of how gender binaries figure in social hierarchies is crucial to our understanding of the political dimension of different cultural productions . Any account of the way Shakespeare has been used to serve dominant interests in American society would be incomplete without a detailed look at how representations of gender sustain these social and political hierarchies . A more positive , and perhaps more properly utopian , way of stating this would be that our own ability to imagine a social world outside of such terms as interests and domination depends on our ability to recognize how our a awareness of the past and the present - in this case , past and present uses of Shakespeare in popular culture - is imbricated in sexual politics .
