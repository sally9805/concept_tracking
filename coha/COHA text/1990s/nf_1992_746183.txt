This study investigated the differential influence of hypnotic susceptibility level on signal detection task ( SDT ) performance in waking and hypnotic conditions . As assessed by the Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility , Form A ( HGSHS : A ) and the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale , Form C ( SHSS : C ) , 20 high ( 9-12 ) , 20 medium ( 4-8 ) , and 20 low ( 0-3 ) hypnotizables participated . In counterbalanced conditions of waking and hypnosis , Ss ( Subjects ) were given 36 signal detection trials , consisting of 12 strong signals , 12 weak signals , and 12 " no " signals . No differences were observed in the waking condition between low , medium , and high hypnotizables on strong and weak signal trials . In hypnosis , high hypnotizables exhibited significantly superior performance on the strong signal trials in comparison with low hypnotizables , and performed significantly better on the weak signal trials than did the low and medium hypnotizables . Low and medium hypnotizables performed similarly in waking and hypnotic conditions , while high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal trials during hypnosis . <p> Hypnosis has been linked to enhancement of a wide variety of perceptual and cognitive phenomena , many of which require the ability to maintain and extract specific items of information from the environment . In particular , hypnotic susceptibility has been shown to be significantly related to visual afterimage duration and latency ( Atkinson &; Crawford , 1988 ; Wallace , 1979 ) , the presence of eidetic imagery in hypnosis ( Crawford , Wallace , Nomura , &; Slater , 1986 ) , improvements in visual acuity with myopic subjects ( Graham &; Leibowitz , 1972 ; Sheehan , Smith , &; Forest , 1982 ) , the production of vivid mental images ( Sheehan , 1979 , 1982 ) , a high capacity for imaginative involvement outside hypnosis ( Tellogen &; Atkinson , 1974 ) , and superior performance on visual memory tasks ( Crawford &; Allen , 1983 ) . Further , short-term exposure to restricted environmental stimulation ( REST ) , a conditian similar in some ways to hypnosis , has been shown to enkance performance on a signal detection task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alterness ( Atkinson &; Sewell , 1988 ) . <p> Coversely , if hypnosis can be used to eahance certain cognitive and perceptual processes , it follows that hypnosis might also be used to diminish thox same processes by altering the Ss selective attention . Hence , it has been shown that the induction of hypnotic deafness reduces auditory sensitivity ( Crawford , MacDonald , &; Hilgard , 1979 ) ; that hypnotic anesthesia interferes with the ability to localize one 's nose ( Wallace &; Hoyenga , 1980 ) and to coordinate motor activity with the appearance of distorted body limbs and objects in the environment while wearing displacing prisms ( Wallace &; Fisher , 1982 ) ; and that auditory interference may occur on tests of visual choice-reaction time in hypnosis ( Blum &; Porter , 1974 ) . <p> In most instances of hypnotically enhanced or diminished performance on cognitive and perceptual tasks , attentional processes may play an important role . Attentional processes are clearly relevant for an understanding of information processing in hypnosis . Support for this assertion can be derived from a variety of studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or have shown the relevance of attentional processes in the differential perfonnance of high and low hypnotizables . Attempts to determine the precise role of attention in hypnosis have shown the existence of positive relationships between performance on cognitive hypnotic suggestions and difficult attentional tasks ( Karlin , 1979 ) , between hypnotizability and performance on an attention deployment task ( Graham &; Evans , 1977 ) , and between hypnotizability and measures of absorption ( Spanos , Ansari , &; Stam , 1979 ; Spanos , Stam , Rivers , &; Radtke , 1980 ; Tellegen &; Atkinson , 1974 ) . Further , hypnotizability appears to be negatively related to the number of thought intrusions reported by Ss while meditating ( Spanos , Rivers , &; Gottlieb , 1978 ; Spanos et al. , 1980 ; Van Nuys , 1973 ) , a finding which indicates that the most highly hyponotizable Ss tend to be superior at focusing attention by eliminating distracting thoughts during meditation . In general , then , hypnotically susceptible individuals appear to be skilled at detecting and processing multiple sources of information and at ignoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and artention takes on special importance in cases of hypnotically enhanced or diminished performance on cognitive and perceptual tasks . Indeed , many instances of hypnotic enhancement of cognitive and perceptual processes have been explained by reference to superior selective attentional skills in high hypnotizables ( e.g. , Atkinson &; Crawford , 1988 ; Wallace , 1979 ) . To investigate the role of selective attention in hypnosis and hypnotizability , the current study employed an SDT as a measure of perceptual enhancement for vision . An SDT was selected because superior performance on such tasks generally requires Ss to recognize and extract target stimuli from a confusing mass of irrelevant stimuli generated on a visual display ; hence , an SDT was considered to be an effective measure of selective attention ( Atkinson &; Sewell , 1988 ) . <p> To examine attentional performance on the selected SDT , high , medium and low hypnotizables were tested in counterbalanced conditions of waking and hypnosis . Based on the evidence for superior attentional skills in high hypnotizables , it was anticipated that those Ss would exhibit superior perfonnance on the SDT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and would perfotTn better in hypnosis than in waking . METHOD <p> Subjects <p> Sixty undergraduate students ( 39 women , 21 men ) from Fort Hays State University were selected to participate in this study based on their performance on the Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility , Form A ( HGSHS:A ; Shor &; Orne , 1962 ) and on the **25;348;TOOLONG version of the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptiblity Scale , Forrn C ( SHSS:C ; Weitzenhoffer &; Hilgard , 1962 ) . Ss were required to score in either the low ( 0-3 ) , moderate ( 4-8 ) , or high ( 9-12 ) range on both scales to be selected for involvement in the study . Participants included 20 high ( SHSS:C M = 10.25 , SD = 1.17 ) , 20 medium ( SHSS:C M = 5.5 , SD = 1.24 ) , and 20 low ( SHSS:C M = 1.0 , SD = 1.02 ) hypnotizables . All Ss reported normal or corrected-normal vision . Ss received extra credit in their course for participation in the study . <p> Materials and Procedure <p> Ss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the hypnotic condition , Ss were seated directly in front of an Apple 2e microcomputer and monitor and were told that they would complete a computer task while in hypnosis . Specific instructions for completion of the task were provided only after hypnotic induction was accomplished through the use of the induction portion of the SHSS:C . Following the hypnotic induction , the room lights were shut off to eliminate possible reflections on the monitor screen and the computer was activated , after which Ss were asked to open their eyes to read the instructions generated on the monitor by an Apple Basic " Signal Detection Task " program . Ss were instructed to notify the experimenter before beginning Trial 1 . The following instructions were provided to Ss : <p> Your environment has a large group of friends who are ordinarily so friendly that you welcome them . But be careful of enemies , for they will get you if you do n't keep your eyes open and catch them . <p> Your friends will be indicated on the screen by the letter F , and the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ask you whether or not you saw an enemy . If the enemy was present , you should press P ; if the enemy was absent , press A. <p> Do not press return after your entry . <p> Press the space bar to begin . <p> Before pressing the space bar to begin Trial 1 , Ss were given the opportunity to ask questions , following which they were told to selectively focus their attention on detecting the E ( enemy ) and were instructed not to allow external stimulation to distract their attention from the task . Ss were then told to press the space bar to begin Trial 1 . After completing all trials , subjects were brought out of hypnosis and were given a postexperimental briefing on the nature of the experiment . <p> In the waking condition , prior to receiving instructions for completion of the signal detection task , Ss were told to rest comfortably with their eyes closed for 15 m , which is an approximate interval required for induction in the hypnotic condition . In all other respects , procedures for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimental session , there was a total of 36 SDT trials . For a given trial , a sequence of F 's ( each one 5 mm high ) was presented at random positions one at a time on the monitor screen ( 19 cm high x 25 cm wide ) until there was a total of 60 letters . Each trial lasted for an interval of 30 s . On 24 trials out of a block of 36 , one of the letters was an E instead of an F. Ss ' task was to detect the presence of the E as accurately as possible . All letters faded from the screen within 30 s of trial onset , after which the following written prompt appeared on the monitor : " If the enemy was present , press P ; if the enemy was absent , press A. " Ss were required to make a response within 5 s . The oext trial was then initiated by pressing the space bar . <p> Signal strength was manipulated by the timing of the target letter to be identified . On 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s . These were classified as " strong " signal trials , since Ss were allowed at least 15 s to locate the target before termination of the trial . On another 12 trials , the E was presented in the last 3 s of the trial . These were identified as " weak " signal trials , since the time allotted to identify and locate the target was so brief . On the remaining 12 trials , the E was not presented . These were classified as " no " signal trials . <p> To prevent experimenter bias , an experimenter who was unaware of the Ss ' hypnotic susceptibility levels was responsible for the experimental procedure , while another experimenter scored Ss ' responses on the hypnotic susceptibility scales , maintained those responses , and scheduled Ss for experimentation . RESULTS <p> The mean number of hits and false aiarrns for low , medium , and high hypnotizables in waking and hypnosis can be found in Table 1 . A Hypnotic Susceptibility Level ( High , Medium , Low ) X Conditions ( Waking , Hypnosis ) X Signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of variance ( ANOVA ) was perfonned on these data . A significant interaction was present for these tluee variables ( F(4,114) = 3.32 , p c .025 ) . Post-hoc comparisons yielded a significantly greater number of strong and weak signal hits in hypnosis ( M = 10.35 ; M = 8.25 ) than in waking ( M = 9.05 ; M = 6.0 ) for high hypnotizables ( F(1,57) = 8.99 , p &lt; .01 ; F ( 1 , S7 ) = 23.77 , p &lt; .001 ) . Medium and low hypnotizables failed to perform significantly better in the hypnotic oondition than in the waking condition for either strong or weak signal trials . In addition , high hypnotizables ( M = 10.35 ) scored a significantly greater number of strong signal hits in hypnosis than did the low hypnotizables ( M = 8.6 ; F(2,57) = 3.84 , p &lt; .05 ) . Medium and low hypnotizables did not differ significantly on strong signal trials . Similarly , high hypnotizables ( M = 8.25 ) scored significantly more weak signal hits during hypnosis than either the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , p &lt; .01 ) or the low hypnotizables ( M = 5.75 ; F(2,57) = 8.42 , p &lt; .001 ) . Medium and low hypnotizables did not differ significantly on weak signal trials . Within- and between-group comparisons failed to yield significant differences in false alarm rates on the no signal trials . <p> Since some degree of individual variability is always present in investigations of hypnotic susceptibility , additional analyses were computed to assess the extent of individual differences in the current study . The number and percentage of Ss who performed better , the same , or worse in the hypnotic condition as compared with the waking condition can be found as a function of signal strength and hypnotic suscept bility level in Table 2 . DISCUSSION <p> Results of this study indicate that hypnotic susceptibility level , experimental condition , and signal strength are all significant factors in the performance of Ss on an SDT . This conclusion is evident from the finding that high hypnotizables performed significantly better in the hypnotic condition than in the waking condition on both strong and weak signal trials . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypnotic susceptibility on SDT performance during hypnosis is greater than for medium and low hypnotic susceptibility . This suggestion is supported by the finding the ' the SDT performance of high hypnotizables in hypnosis was significantly superior to medium and low hypnotizables on weak signal trials and significantly better than low hypnotizables on strong signal trials . These results should not be considered surprising since reports of enhanced perceptual and cognitive functioning are quite common for high hypnotizables ( Atkinson &; Crawford , 1988 ; Crawford &; Allen , 1983 ; Crawford et al. , 1986 ; Graham &; Leibowitz , 1972 ; Sheehan , 1979 , 1982 ; Sheehan et al. , 1982 ; Tellegen &; Atkinson , 1974 ; Wallace , 1979 ) . <p> One important feature shared between superior performance on the SDT errployed in this study and high hypnotic susceptibility is the relationship of both to focused attention ( Atkinson &; Sewell , 1988 ) . As discussed previously , selective attention skills appear to be significantly related to hypnotizability , with high hypnotizables tending toward stronger performance on attentional tasks than medium and low hypnotizables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Spanos et al .. 1978 , 1979 , 1980 ; Tellegen &; Atkinson , 1974 ; Van Nuys , 1973 ) . Therefore , one plausible explanation for the results in this study is that high hypnotizables performed better on the SDT in hypnosis than the medium and low hypnotizables because they possessed superior selective attention skills . However , since the high hypnotizables did not outperform the medium and low hypnotizables in a waking state , this explanation alone is inadequate to explain the results . Perhaps the best explanation for this discrepancy is that hypnosis facilitates focused attention , but particularly for high hypnotizables who may already possess superior attentional skills . Similar findings have been obtained in other studies . For example , high hypnotizables sometimes exhibit eidetic imagery ( Crawford et al. , 1986 ) and enhanced performance on visual memory discrimination tasks ( Crawford &; Allen , 1983 ) , but only in hypnosis . In contrast , nonresponsive Ss do not show enhanced performance on such tasks . Crawford ( 1981,1982,1983 ) has argued that high hypnotizables shift from a detail-oriented processing strategy during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in information-processing strategies ostensibly links correlates of hypnotizability , such as imaginative involvement , focused attention , and the production of vivid mental images . Hence , high hypnotizables may perform better than medium and low hypnotizables on an SDT in hypnosis , but not in waking , because hypnosis induces a shift to a holistic-oriented information processing strategy in responsive Ss . Such a shift among high hypnotizables in the current study may have facilitated their attentional processes , particularly on weak signal trials , which were considerably more difficult to detect than were strong signal trials . <p> Since enhanced SDT performance requires perceptual vigilance through selective attention , the results of this study may have practical implications for some occupations that require long hours of monitoring monotonous visual stimulation , such as that of air traffic controller . Such implications should be developed by professionals in the human performance field . <p>
