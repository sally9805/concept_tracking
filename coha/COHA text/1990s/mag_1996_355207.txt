The bad guys have chased Vanessa Williams into the reptile house of a Manhattan zoo , when Arnold Schwarzenegger shows up . He fires a round into the alligator case , breaking the glass and freeing dozens of killer creatures . They eat most of the villains like canapes , but one of the beasts heads for our star . It 's about to devour him when he blasts the gator to leathereens . " You 're luggage , " Arnold observes . <P> He 's baaaack . After three jokey films ( Last Action Hero , Junior , True Lies ) that defiled the great stone totem that is Schwarzenegger , Eraser is a return to basics . The film , which had a troubled history and a humongous reported price tag of $120 million , could have been a fiasco ; instead , it smartly remythologizes this indispensable Hollywood icon . <P> As a U.S. Marshal in the Witness Protection Program , Arnold is really Special Agent in Charge of Blowing Stuff Up . Is he human ? No , he 's super- and sub- . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he survives all manner of impalement . Hell , he can even type . And he has the superhero 's belief in his own invincibility . Unarmed and surrounded by villains pointing heavy artillery at him , Arnold tells his main captor , " If you drop your gun , I promise I wo n't kill you . " <P> At this moment our star is in a plane over New York City . He needs to reach his main witness ( Williams ) before some malevolent brutes erase her identity by wiping her out . Figuring that the shortest distance between two points is straight down , Arnold throws a parachute out the plane door , jumps after it , flies like Superman to catch up with it , then dodges the plane as it circles back to kill him . <P> It 's a neat stunt  --  one of the scenes that make Eraser , like The Rock , a medium-high entry in the action genre . Briskly directed by Charles Russell , Eraser seems a near-photostat of Mission Impossible ( the break-in of a secretive Washington-area facility to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be killed ) but with more brio . It also boasts some of the genre 's standard idiocies . The script , by Tony Puryear , Walon Green and Michael S. Chernuchin , dreams up a new era of hand-held weaponry : a heat-seeking assault rifle . But the bad guys ca n't shoot straight enough with these can't-miss guns to hit either star . When they are on target , they often kill one another . <P> Williams is the damsel in distress ; she gets to kick and shoot a few bad people , but at the climax , when she needs to pick up a gun , it slips through her fingers . ( Girls  --  ca n't they do anything ? ) James Caan , as Arnold 's boss , nicely gauges the power and menace of a G-man too long in the game ; when he says the word patriotism , it sounds like " paid treason . " Schwarzenegger , of course , is a paid tree trunk . And for the first time in a while , his character is as solid as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By Richard Corliss
