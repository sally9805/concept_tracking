<p> At his first news conference , the newly inaugurated president of Haiti appealed for political unity , pledged fiscal responsibility and an end to government corruption , and promised to uphold the constitutional rights of all citizens . <p> Was this the popularly elected Jean-Bertrand Aristide , whom the United States is trying to restore to power as the apostle of democracy ? No , it was Francois " Papa Doc " Duvalier , perhaps the most bloodthirsty of Haiti 's numerous dictators , shortly after taking office in 1957 . <p> Under Duvalier , as under almost every Haitian ruler since independence in 1804 , promises of democracy and individual rights were mockeries and illusions . The reality , according to Haiti experts , has been a unique political and economic environment that combined brutality and buffoonery , with every rule and policy dictated by whoever was in power . <p> " Haitian governments have always been governments of men , not of institutions , " the journalists Bernard Diederich and Al Burt wrote in " Papa Doc , " their 1969 biography of Duvalier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country offers little reason for optimism about the Clinton administration 's plan to " restore " Haitian democracy and " rebuild " Haiti 's economy by aiding Aristide 's government . By most accounts Haiti has never had democracy , and its marginal economy has mostly benefited the country 's tiny ruling elite , who exploited the masses and looted the state . <p> " Regardless of the government in power , the social and economic problems facing Haiti are overwhelming , " according to the Oxford Companion to Politics of the World , a standard reference work . <p> " A key fissure is the majority black population versus the small mulatto group , which has existed since before independence , " says the Oxford Companion . " This division overlaps substantially but not completely with the economic gap between a small group of very rich and the overwhelming majority of the poor . These schisms , plus the lack of a viable productive economy , the dependence on imports and foreign aid for basic necessities , and the enormous expectations aroused by Aristide 's election , will pose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Haiti was not always poor . In the 18th century , it was one of France 's most prosperous possessions . But that prosperity was built on slavery and ended soon after Haiti 's slaves  --  inspired by the French Revolution and led by Toussaint L'Ouverture , Jean-Jacques Dessalines and Henri Christophe  --  rebelled and gained their independence . <p> The plantations were broken up and parceled out as tiny farms to Haitians who lacked the capital and expertise to manage them . At the same time , the new government was burdened by a huge indemnity it had agreed to pay France . Speaking neither English nor Spanish but their unique Creole patois , Haiti 's peasants and artisans were outcasts of the Caribbean , ravaged by disease , handicapped by illiteracy and oppressed by their country 's ruling class . <p> Tens of thousands were shipped to the neighboring Dominican Republic as sugar cane cutters , a way of life only marginally better than they had as slaves . <p> The French-speaking , and generally light-skinned , upper classes in Port-au-Prince were not poor , but neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyrants , selling their political allegiance often to whatever army officer or political upstart cut them the best deal . <p> According to Thomas A. Bailey 's " Diplomatic History of the American People , " by World War I , " a long procession of presidents had held office , most of them being elected for the short term ending with the next revolution  --  provided that they were not shot , poisoned or blown to bits in the meantime . " <p> In 1915 , Bailey wrote , " the Haitian volcano finally erupted ... when President Guillaume Sam engineered a cold-blooded butchering of some 150 imprisoned political foes . A vengeful mob dragged him from behind a dresser in the French legation , where he had taken refuge , and literally tore him limb from limb . " <p> President Woodrow Wilson , fearing German intervention that would violate the Monroe Doctrine and threaten the security of the Panama Canal , sent U.S. Marines to occupy Haiti and take over most of the civil administration . That occupation lasted 19 years , instilling in many Haitians a hostility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration says the latest U.S. intervention must not follow . <p> As Smedley D. Butler , a Marine officer who participated in the 1915 expedition , later told the journalist Lowell Thomas , " It 's not easy to build up an efficient organization out of a population speaking a language you do n't know and with customs you do n't understand . " <p> That is why the Clinton administration 's plan calls for letting the Haitians do the organization-building , with international assistance . The role of foreign troops is to give Aristide what U.S. officials call " breathing space " to establish a government of laws and self-perpetuating institutions without fear of violence . That is the task Haitians have been unable to accomplish in 190 years of independence . <p> The American occupation of 1915-34 brought Haiti a period of relative stability , at a cost of several thousand Haitian lives , at least in part because the Haitians channeled their frustrations into resentment of the white occupiers , rather than against one another . <p> But after the Americans left , successive Haitian presidents ruled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everyone else , stoking opposition among the country 's growing black bourgeoisie , who unlike the peasants were not helpless . A mulatto-based government was overthrown in 1946 as the country 's first black-based trade unions and leftist movements took hold , and a black liberal populist , Dusmarsais Estime , was elected president  --  only to be ousted in yet another military coup in 1950 . <p> Haiti enjoyed a brief international vogue in the 1950s as the tourist industry grew , a medical assistance campaign organized by the United States brought the plague of yaws  --  an infectious tropical disease  --  under control , and Broadway stars frequented the capital . As vice president , Richard M. Nixon visited . Accounts from that time described high-living celebrities enjoying the good life in Port-au-Prince and tourists soaking up the sun with no thought to what was happening in the villages . <p> Then Duvalier became president , after a violent campaign and a tainted election . Mystical , erratic , suspicious and ruthless , he ruled by firing squad , aided by the thuggish praetorian guard known as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predecessors of the " attaches " terrorizing Haitians today , saw to it that Duvalier 's foes , real or imagined , disappeared or were killed . <p> President John F. Kennedy suspended U.S. aid to protest the Duvalier regime 's human rights record , but the United States never broke completely with Haiti because Duvalier resisted the blandishments of Fidel Castro 's Communist rule in Cuba . <p> In 1964 Duvalier overrode Haiti 's constitution and declared himself " president for life , " which he turned out to be , remaining until his death in 1971 . He bequeathed the office and the title of president for life to his 19-year-old son , Jean-Claude , known as " Baby Doc . " <p> It was a tribute to the security apparatus set up by his father that Baby Doc remained in power for 15 years . His style was less brutal than his father 's  --  he often deported his opponents instead of killing them  --  but the plight of the Haitian majority remained as it always had been . <p> The beginning of the end for Jean-Claude Duvalier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the provinces . He promised parliamentary elections and proposed limited legalization of political parties , but these palliatives were insufficient when four teenagers were shot during a demonstration in 1985 . <p> Duvalier shuffled his cabinet , reduced food prices , closed universities and finally declared martial law , but by January 1986 he faced what turned out to be an easy choice : Remain in office and face increasing violence and dissent , or take his immense personal fortune and go into sumptuous exile on the French Riviera . Duvalier and his wife left Haiti on a U.S. military plane on Feb. 7 , 1986 . <p> The end of the Duvalier regime produced an odd result : military rule and political reform at the same time . Gen. Henri Namphy assumed power , suspended the constitution and disbanded parliament . But he also disbanded the Ton-tons Macoutes , restored freedom of expression , allowed political opponents to return from exile and promised constitutional reform . <p> A new constitution that abolished the death penalty , reduced the power of the presidency , decentralized government , banned " notorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved by more than 99 percent of the electorate in March 1987 . <p> The terms of that constitution produced the election that gave the presidency of the Maryland-size nation to Aristide in December 1990 . But they also produced the social welfare initiatives and agrarian reform policies that threatened to reduce the political and economic power of the economic elite and of the army , which ousted Aristide in September 1991 , seven months after he took office . Even if restored to power , Aristide still faces an inevitable conflict with the rest of the Haitian power structure .
