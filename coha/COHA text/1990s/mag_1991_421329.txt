New research may have profound implications for coyotes , the most misunderstood predators in the American West <p> TICK ... TICK , chirps the little box about the size of a transistor radio . TICK . Biologist Bob Crabtree slowly turns the receiver 's antenna , which towers out of the roof of a plywood shack on Yellowstone National Park 's Blacktail Plateau . TICK , TICK . The signals are coming faster now . Crabtree glances out the plastic window in the general direction the antenna is pointing  --  toward his target . " He 's out over there , " Crabtree says , aiming his finger toward a lonely grove of pines in the distance . " They 're out there resting up while it 's still hot out . Later on , when it cools off , they 'll become active and start hunting for food . " <p> Resting in the far-off stand on a summer afternoon in Yellowstone is perhaps the most misunderstood but prevalent predator of the American West . It 's smaller than a wolf but larger than a fox , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both a revered symbol of the West and a hated troublemaker . What Crabtree and his crew have been watching so intently in Yellowstone for the last year , and will for the next four , is canis latrans : the coyote . <p> In perhaps the first large-scale study of a coyote population untinged by human wrath , the team , funded by the National Park Service , is examining the wily creatures and their intrinsic connection to other parts of the Yellowstone ecosystem . What they are discovering may have profound impacts on government coyote-eradication projects and may also imply dramatic changes in Yellowstone 's pending restoration of another major predator , the grey wolf . <p> " We really need to know our predators to know how complete our ecosystem is , " says Yellowstone Research Chief John Varley . " Since predators top the food chain , everything is magnified for them . They are really a defining factor in environmental health . " <p> Using advanced research techniques , the team is finding coyotes in Yellowstone very different from those inhabiting other western lands , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaigns . Park coyotes have more stable communities and social structures and hunt in packs like wolves . This is probably the normal lifestyle for coyotes ; not the solitary life coyotes in the West have adopted to survive the advancement of civilization . In the absence of wolves , Crabtree suspects , coyotes have slid at least partially into the wolves ' niche , often preying on large mammals like elk that might not normally be such a large part of their diet . <p> " Coyotes have certainly taken over some of the wolf 's role in the park , " Crabtree says . " How much and how well is what we are trying to find out . " But whatever it is , the coyote , not prey species , is the one creature that probably will be most affected if wolves come back , because the two species will be in direct competition for prey . <p> A romantic icon of the American West , the coyote-=-sometimes nicknamed the " moon dog " or " prairie wolf "  --  has long filled frontier lore . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crafty jokester . To some , the coyote 's yipping bay was a familiar sound of security . But soon , the coyote became the hated scourge of modern ranchers whose sheep they sometimes kill . Today , the Department of Agriculture spends close to $30 million nationwide on predator control projects to kill coyotes , primarily on western rangeland . <p> That does not include the sanctuary of Yellowstone , but it once did . When the world 's first national park was established in 1872 , it was a haven for big-game hunters who reasoned that coyotes , wolves , mountain lions , and other predators unfairly cut into their take . So hunters and park managers began lacing carcasses with strychnine and broken glass and dynamiting dens to kill any scavenging " flesh-eaters . " <p> " In the winter coyotes hereabouts became so numerous that I at last felt obligated to order the destruction of some of them , " early park Superintendent George S. Anderson wrote in his 1893 annual report . In 1897 , Superintendent S.B.M. Young commented that " coyotes are numerous and bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antelope that wintered in the valley of Gardiner and on the slopes of Mount Everts , 75 ( 15 percent of the herd ) were killed by coyotes during the past winter , and many antelope fawns , elk calves , and broods of grouse have been destroyed by them this season . " According to historic records from 1904 to 1935 , 121 mountain lions , 132 wolves , and .4,352 coyotes were killed in the park . <p> While wolves and cougars were virtually wiped out of Yellowstone by the turn of the century , coyotes  --  more abundant , prolific , and wary  --  hung on despite continued intermittent killing . It was not until 1940 that they and other predators ( for which it was too late ) finally got the same protection as the tourist-pleasing wildlife . That was the year that naturalist Adolph Murie published his landmark study , " Ecology of the Coyote in the Yellowstone , " which for the first time credited the coyote as a " desirable member of the assembly of animals . " <p> Biologists usually examined specific animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of promoting a population 's size for hunting " harvest . " But Murie was one of the first to consider a species within the context of its entire environment  --  looking , for instance , at how the coyote affects other prey animals as well . He concluded that coyotes and other predators play an important role in keeping other species from gophers to elk healthy by culling the weak and infirm . <p> " The big picture is the key , " says renowned predator biologist Maurice Hornocker , who founded the nonprofit Wildlife Research Institute , which is administering the $120,000 coyote study and a simultaneous study of Yellowstone mountain lions , which could be sharply affected by wolves cutting into their hunting base . " What Murie did and what we 're doing on an even more advanced basis is looking at all the environmental influences that affect an organism directly and indirectly . It 's a seamless fabric . " <p> After Murie released his study , coyote control in Yellowstone ceased , and the maligned species began to flourish . Now , without any wolves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain the region 's foremost predator next to the threatened grizzly bear . So park managers decided in 1989 to gather baseline information on coyotes in the wake of the 1988 forest fires and in the face of potential wolf reintroduction , bogged down in political rhetoric for years . If wolves  --  the one missing link in the park 's ecosystem  --  are ever restored , it would be a spectacular opportunity to watch the effects one predator species would have on another . <p> " It 's an incredibly crucial question to answer , " Crabtree says . " The park 's foresight here could give us the knowledge we need to manage national parks as the true ecosystems they should he and as models for other ecosystems in need of restoration . " <p> Biologists suspect that major predators , sitting at the top of any food chain , are one of the most important factors in the entire structure and diversity of an ecosystem . They affect how and where other species live and , consequently , which live and which die . Research in South America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals , predators help effectively control the growth patterns and success of plants in the jungle . <p> SIMILAR EVENTS could be happening in Yellowstone . There are somewhere around 400 coyotes living in the park 's lower elevation northern range , where Crabtree 's study is concentrating . Coyotes prey on both small rodents  --  lots of mice , pocket gophers , and meadow voles ( Murie found that rodents and grasshoppers comprise 60 percent of a coyote 's diet )  --  and larger mammals like elk , antelope , and deer . If present , wolves would prey mostly on the larger mammals , while red foxes , strangely rare in Yellowstone , prey almost exclusively on the smaller rodents , which probably consume more grasses than any other animal class . More numerous than they would be if wolves were present , Yellowstone coyotes take up territory and prey that foxes normally would use , preventing extra fox predation on vegetarian rodents . <p> Yellowstone coyotes should fare better than their brethren on Isle Royale if wolves return to the park . When wolves first crossed ice-covered Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Park , coyotes were abundant there . After a few years , wolves had crowded coyotes into invisibility , while fox populations boomed . Now , there is a healthy population of red foxes , some wolves , and no coyotes . <p> Unlike the smaller , confined environment of Isle Royale , Yellowstone is large enough to accommodate both wolves and coyotes . If wolves return to Yellowstone , coyotes would almost certainly decline but not disappear , Crabtree says . Wolves would take up much , but perhaps not all , of the slack in influencing big game herds . No longer competing against so many coyotes , fox populations could also rebound , eating even more rodents than coyotes do now , and thus allowing the park 's grasslands to further prosper . That would mean more forage for big game , and more big game would mean more food for wolves and coyotes It 's a never-ending , hypothetical merry-go-round of causes and effects " There are a lot of theories about the role of predators in molding ecological communities , " Crabtree says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all works " <p> Making the most of that chance , however , is a complicated business , requiring both manual labor and advanced research and analytical techniques . Crabtree and his team of volunteers and paid workers will spend hours tracking coyotes with radio transmitters , watching them through binoculars , collecting coyote scats to determine the animals ' population density and diet , and mapping the creatures ' sovereign territories . <p> Since last fall , the study team has captured 37 adult coyotes from 13 territorial packs , examining and marking them in a systematic 45-minute process . With smelly lures simulating coyote scents , researchers set padded jaw traps with a shock absorber to keep from injuring the coyote . A radio transmitter alerts researchers when the trap is sprung , so they can be on the scene within minutes after an animal is caught <p> First , the group blindfolds the coyote to keep it calm , takes its body temperature , and checks it for shock . Researchers then weigh and measure the coyote and take a blood sample , to be used for nutritional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and packs . They look for distinguishing characteristics  --  scars usually prove an animal as the dominant , or " alpha " member of a pack  --  and administer antibiotics to prevent any infection . Finally , they strap a radio collar around the coyote 's neck . Since newborn pups are perhaps most telling of the coyote population 's future , Crabtree 's team also captured and examined 13 of the young Instead of using radio collars , which can not expand to accommodate the juveniles ' growth , veterinarians implanted a plastic-encased transmitter in the creatures ' abdominal cavities . Equivalent to only about three percent of a three-pound pup 's weight , and less as it grows , the harmless but permanent implant is not as intrusive as a radio collar might be . <p> Most coyote studies have reported roughly one inadvertent death for every 20 animals captured . But after more than 200 captures , Crabtree has not recorded a single death in Yellowstone or during his other studies of coyotes at California 's Mono Lake and Washington 's Hanford Nuclear Reservation . <p> With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracking stations , cloistered from the view of visitors , to follow coyotes through their daily routine They have pinpointed the creatures more than 5,000 times , mapping each location to establish the boundaries of coyote territories . Coyotes generally rest during the day and grow active as dusk approaches  --  patrolling their territory and foraging for food . They rest again for a few hours in the middle of the night , and then go back on the prowl until shortly after dawn . Coyotes are known to be smart and keenly adaptable , traits that helped them survive the violent campaigns that quickly claimed their fellow predators . They eat grasshoppers , crickets , and even ants , and killed roughly 40 percent of elk calves under study in northern Yellowstone 's Lamar Valley . Coyotes have probably benefitted from 1988 's fires , which opened and fertilized areas for grasses and shrubs that are important to small rodent species , boosting the predator food supply . <p> Hanging around picnic areas , coyotes also take full advantage of park visitors who illegally offer them handouts . Rangers trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go undercover , wearing plain clothes and driving unmarked vehicles because the coyotes learned to recognize their uniforms and patrol cars . <p> Researchers have noticed that Yellowstone 's coyotes  --  the biggest of the species in North America  --  tend to function in packs , a characteristic not generally recognized among most western coyotes . Each pack includes a dominant breeding male and female as well as several young " helpers " or " biders , " so called because they are biding their time before leaving the group . By watching specific pups , Crabtree hopes to determine when and why young coyotes leave the pack : do the more capable pups set out first ? Do their parents force them out ? Do they start a new pack or join an established one ? <p> Although their packs are smaller , Yellowstone coyotes have a social structure very similar to that of wolves ; the one difference is that while some coyote pups usually strike out on their own after a summer with their parents , young wolves generally stay with their parents through the first winter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring down their larger prey , and young wolves can not survive solely on easily caught rodents as coyotes can . <p> But there are notable differences between coyotes in Yellowstone and those in other parts of the West , where they are targets of government trappers who , to keep land safe for livestock , poison them , shoot them from airplanes , and dig up their dens to kill their pups . In natural areas like Yellowstone , researchers have found an annual average of two to three newborn pups per territory , while exploited populations generally average about five to eight per territory . That means that in areas where coyotes are hunted heavily , they reproduce more quickly to repopulate vacant domains . <p> Those coyotes that do take over vacant territories are often young and inexperienced and hunt alone rather than in packs . Not having secured status , they may turn to killing more sheep , a veritable fast food , than those that were there before . And several federal studies have also proven that coyotes kill the most prey  --  whether it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So by killing coyotes indiscriminately and leading them to produce more young at an earlier age , control agents may actually be boosting coyote predation when they are really trying to lower it . <p> Coming up against coyote 's instinctive cunning , efforts to kill them off may have backfired even more than we realize . Early rangers and ranchers , by poisoning carcasses in hopes of killing predators , destroyed those animals that scavenged on already dead animals , and probably taught coyotes to kill fresh meat . Hunters shoot the most visible and vulnerable coyotes , sparing those most skilled at stealth and hiding . Despite persecution that annually kills up to 70 percent of their populations in some places , coyotes have not only not died off , they have actually expanded their range toward the East Coast . In short , some biologists think , predator control efforts have turned the mythic coyote into an American " superpredator , " more evasive and inclined to kill than any that existed before . Yet a new draft environmental impact statement prepared by the Department of Agriculture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing current programs . The document did not consider preliminary results of the Yellowstone study or any other research on unexploited coyote populations . <p> " We know so little about them , and yet we spent millions and millions of dollars trying to get rid of them ; it 's a complete fiasco , " says Hornocker , one of the first to question predator control programs . " In many cases ; the best control is no control at all ; they will limit their own numbers if you just leave them alone . " <p> With its protected status , Yellowstone is home to what is probably one of the most stable coyote populations in the United States , making its study even more important to knowledge of the coyote as a species . When wolves return , the habits and lives of both coyotes and their prey will change ; but that grand experiment , too , will reveal dramatic clues to the true nature of natural systems . For while coyotes have resisted human wrath for years , they may not do as well against one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiver keeps on ticking off the radio beacon of a far-off coyote , Crabtree jots down the hidden creature 's coordinates . " That 's where it is right now , " the biologist says . " Who knows what Hill be happening here in ten years . Will there be wolves or coyotes or more elk or fewer elk or better forage ? Whatever it is , if all the pieces are in place , it will be closer to the real Yellowstone .
