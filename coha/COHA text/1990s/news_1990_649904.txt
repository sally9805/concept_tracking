<p> The man responsible for subjecting scores of his fellow State Department employees to the mental torture of polygraph tests confessed at a Senate hearing last week that " I took a lie detector test and did not do well on it , and what I learned from that is that they are very unreliable devices . " <p> Robert Lamb , as Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security , had asked for a leak investigation  --  complete with polygraph " fluttering "  --  into the revelation to the press that Felix Bloch was suspected of being a Soviet spy : " We had to find out how this was getting out there . " <p> What Mr. Lamb found out instead was how a career can be jeopardized by a spike on a nervousness chart . He had spoken to four reporters about the Bloch affair , and what he told the F.B.I . about what he had said triggered a negative polygraph report . That drew him into the web of an extensive plumber 's operation . <p> " I was told by an F.B.I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way on this , " he protested to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at an unreported hearing . He asserted , " I have dealt with some of the most sensitive matters that we have in the Government . " <p> But the needle had jumped . As a result , Mr. Lamb had been placed in limbo at the Baker State Department . Finally , he was designated to be ambassador to Cyprus , but six months passed before his nomination was sent up for confirmation . <p> Why the long delay , the " warehousing " at full pay of a official given nothing to do ? The reason : In many leak investigations , when a subject does not satisfy the polygraph examiner , the Department of Justice puts the suspect on ice  --  leaving the case open for years , in effect punishing the person with no regard to due process . <p> I am told by one such investigative victim that 44 officials are now being " warehoused , " some working in the mailroom ; State wo n't say . ( Only our State Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine mail . ) At Defense , where the old Weinberger polygraph virus spreads unrestrained , the number may be higher . <p> In Mr. Lamb 's case , however , Hill pressure was brought to bear because Senators Joseph Biden and Paul Sarbanes consider Cyprus important and want a U.S. ambassador there to argue with the Turks . <p> Reluctantly , Justice cleared Mr. Lamb last week  --  it hates to open the F.B.I . ' s lie-detector warehouse  --  and Foreign Relations immediately held its hearing . <p> One problem remained : On the committee questionnaire that asked if the nominee " had been interviewed or asked to supply information " in an investigation , Mr. Lamb  --  who certainly had been interviewed , time and again  --  checked " no . " <p> Asked to explain this apparent deception , Mr. Lamb claimed that Ivan Selin , in charge of management at State , had told him he was no longer being investigated , which was how he then chose to interpret the questionnaire . Senator Biden said drily that the F.B.I . had told him the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat out of the bag : " I was told . . . that investigations of this type are kept open indefinitely , and in fact the investigation probably would never be closed . . . . " <p> Consider that : One assessment by an anonymous merchant of sweat that a subject hooked up to a machine made the needle move funny , and that person becomes a bureaucratic zombie  --  walking , talking , collecting pay , but dead . <p> I hold no brief for Mr. Lamb , who ( a ) will go to the Middle East to represent the Kelly-Glaspie School of Warped American Values and ( b ) is hostage to Senator Sarbanes , who wants us to zap the Turks at a time we need Turkey for a coordinated assault on Iraq . <p> But even a slippery cookie-pusher with a headful of secrets to embarrass prosecutors has some civil rights . One is due process  --  not to be denied by a machine operator whom real spies are trained to defeat . <p> " I am sorry for your experience , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but delighted that . . . someone like you gets caught in the web and makes our case for us . " <p> That case is that the polygraph is dangerously unreliable . Those like Mr. Lamb who call it a " helpful tool " in interrogation mean that it scares suspects more than a rubber hose . <p> Joe Biden is also chairman of Senate Judiciary . He tells me , " I ca n't say I know , but I do n't doubt there are people who get into ' polygraph purgatory . ' " He is considering looking into that in the next session ; if you 've been warehoused by a sweat merchant , let him know .
