I 've been in this calle often ; I know it well . I come here to wonder and look onto the black water , playing and splashing mere inches from my feet . The first time I came here was by chance while scurrying to the Rialto late at night . Following the labyrinth of dark streets in Santa Croce , I saw something shining five steps in front of me and moved toward it to pick it up . Such a curiosity , it was . Some calli in Venice , this one included , see no light from the moon or the sun , and are illuminated only from the faint glow of tenants ' apartments three levels above the ground floor . This object stared out at me , glistening , beckoning me , the only light on this narrow , solemn , joyless stretch of pavement . Before I could reach it , oh , I could almost feel it in my hand I was so close , I felt a familiar caress across my toes . It was the silky touch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could n't see I was walking into a canal , trying to pick up the moonlight that was shining off the water . How silly , I thought , here I am in the middle of Venice 's nowhere trying to grab the moonlight . <p> From that night on , I often took a detour onto this lonely , tiny street , frequented by no one , a forgotten corner of Venice 's maze of streets . The silence of the calle during the day turns to an eerie stillness at night , heightened by the blackness enveloping it . Nighttime is my preferred time of day to visit this alley , which even God had forsaken . Just off the corte del Diavolo , it truly is the Devil 's lair . This Devil 's alley is narrow , short , and claustrophobic . It is merely the space between two high buildings , which seem to hold no residents . It opens onto a narrow , ugly canal , which meets the alley perpendicularly and is level with the walkway itself . Haphazardly , the canal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at night , there is nothing but the echo of my footsteps , my breath , the lapping of the furious water against the cold , mossy stones , and the suffocating smell of the canal . That smell is unique to Venice ; if one has not been here , one ca n't appreciate or imagine it . It 's the smell of open water mixed with modern day refuse and old , musty mystique . When the summer heat engulfs the islands and no winds circulate , the watery , moldy , green smell hangs stagnantly in the air , sickening to most , strangely precious to others like me . In my mind I 've often imagined an invisible cloud of this stench permanently hovering over the city , stubbornly immobile and unique to this most watery corner of the world . <p> On this winter night , however , the bitter wind is almost enough to keep my mind from the disgusting odor of the canal . It is freezing in my hidden nook , and my hands shake despite the sorry mittens I bought just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Santa Maria del Giglio , on the other side of the city . The cold forced me to spend some of my precious coins on them , and while that old woman sits in her house tonight with my money stuffed in her pocket , I stand here in the cold , desolate . I came to Venice for the first time some years ago , optimistic and naive , struck by its art and culture and immediately knew that I belonged here . I ca n't describe why . It was something intangible that I felt as soon as I saw the mouth of the Grand Canal near the Lista di Spagna , as soon as I took in the air and the aura of Venice . Venice is the stuff for which travel journals were created ; her glossy , grand exteriors make for beautiful paintings and her quaint streets hold endless inspiration . Visitors pass through the city by the thousands , reveling in the pink perfection of the Palazzo Ducale and the verdigris acqua soaking their feet , barely stopping to visit the Venice that lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , in this narrow alley . It is the cold , unvisited , unadorned Venice . While most are safely snug in rented beds , I stay out at night and wander , freezing , looking for the Venice I ca n't find during the bright day . <p> This is the only place on earth I feel at home , as if I can tell Venice all of my secrets , share all my troubles , and she will protect me like a mother . Her waters help me paint , her history helps me write , her beauty gives me faith in man , and her crisp , cool nighttime silence lets me think clearly . I know Venice at her best and worst and she knows me just as well ; I feel unguarded and natural here . She shows her beautiful facades to tourists , but I 've seen her when she takes off her mask and shows her true self . After the orchestras of the grand cafes in Piazza San Marco have put their graceful bows to sleep and the harried shopkeepers go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious Venice stretches her arms out wide and prepares to enchant those willing to accept her . <p> Late at night I walk in Piazza San Marco , embracing the calm which is so rare during the light hours . Often the velvety , dense fog obscures the way and it is impossible to see an arm 's length in front of my feet . I can only hear the scant , hushed voices echoing in the deserted square , and the pink-tinted nebbia hides the people who belong to these voices until they are right beside me . Walking from one end of the piazza to the other becomes a journey in which I cautiously step , expecting some dark , quiet figure to jump out and seize me , carrying me off into the fog , into nowhere . When Venice puts her visitors to bed at night and covers herself with her foggy blanket , she gives you the chance to see her as she really is . Secretive , mysterious , and twinkling , she is silent but for the sounds of her water . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the campi flood with people during Carnevale and empty during cold November downpours . Each time I come I am looking for things I can find nowhere else : inspiration , hope , solace . I returned here many months ago with my meager savings hoping to somehow thrive , write volumes in the inspirational surroundings , travel in intellectual circles , and find a reason to continue on . <p> Of course I knew these were only dreams . I now realize that coming back to Venice was an act of desperation-an attempt to surround myself with inspiration and beauty because I felt increasingly hopeless and ugly . After months of wandering the cold back alleys here and trying to find solutions to questions I 'm not even sure of , I am left with little money , without hope , of no importance to anyone . <p> Does n't it seem that restless people such as artists and writers and travelers are doomed to be poor , lonely souls ? They have casual ties to many people and meaningful ties to no one but themselves and their chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and try to fill themselves by running from place to place , person to person , and experience to experience . Perhaps they are alone because no one understands their spirit and ca n't love them . Daily I sit in Piazza San Marco and watch the tourists feeding grain to the overstuffed pigeons . They all seem to have normal lives , families , homes , and people who care about them . Their lives are almost enviably simple . They live each day knowing what will happen , when it will happen , and what they will do about it . I have spent my life traveling from city to city , country to country , bed to bed , searching for experience , looking for love , wanting more than they have . <p> I always thought I was superior to them because I had seen and done more things than they would ever do . After all , I am a lone adventurer in Venice , a place that seems too exotic and unique for even the greatest writer to invent . Yet here it is and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the knowledge that theirs will not be a celebrated life , that they will not change the world , that their opinions and thoughts and memories will not matter fifty years after they are buried . Should I turn off my longing for something more than that ? That longing has brought me here , to the protective arms of Venice , because there is no other place for me . <p> I usually lodge in squalid pensioni , different ones every few days . They are always lively and full of the proprietors ' screaming children or toothless mothers-in-law or lascivious , winking fathers . My food is bought or stolen from the outdoor markets and shopkeepers that line the streets here . Fortunately I 've learned how to maximize my buying power . A lilting laugh or flirtatious smile thrown to the aged , withered vendors is often enough to get an extra apple or bottle of wine thrown in with my purchased goods . Old women bargain the price with their cunning and stubbornness ; young women do it with the vague promise of untold delights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venice where an old lover gives me a bed and a decent meal for nothing more than a sexual favor . When I met him years ago as an innocent girl , he was a worldly , lusty , temperamental Venetian who opened his city , his heart , and his bed to me . His water-colored eyes and fiery nature drew me to him , but the subsequent years have drained his charm and passion and made him cruel . <p> Lately I have felt like a prostitute trekking to his door , behind which he waits eagerly , like a dog before the table scraps . I am allowed to go to his house after midnight , when his neighborhood is sufficiently still and he is ready for me . He feigns little interest in my life , why I am here , what I care about , what I had hoped to be and do . To him , I 'm little more than a convenient diversion who asks for little more than a small meal , a bath , and a place to store my small bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had about our relationship have dissolved . I know exactly what I am to him . He needs a woman , and I need a bed ; we are using each other to get something each of us sorely needs . I have so little money that sometimes I ask him for extra lire to buy food during the day . He throws them at me in disgust as if I were asking for his very soul , but I am neither proud nor ashamed enough to stop asking . Would I be better off if I did have a great sum of money ? It is useful but hardly my biggest problem . Ca n't one be rich and respected and still feel empty and useless inside ? If one can see no reason for living life , the richest man 's coffers mean nothing . <p> To date I have only borrowed what he earns in two or three days of work , but he treats me as if I am a conniving harlot , slyly bribing him with sex to get what I want . He tolerates me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he knows he can take advantage of my situation . In my angrier moments I haughtily tell him that I am going to go home with the next man who propositions me and never come to him for help again . I suppose I could manage a meal and a bed every night by simply making myself available to all the men who smile at me during the day . I do n't because I would rather deal with one man who is a certified bastard than with fifty who have the potential . And I must admit , for as badly as he treats me , right now he is my closest friend in the world . <p> His apartment sits on a back street far from everything . It lies on the piano terra , so I can open his windows and look onto the shimmering canal at night . The cold wind fills his house with that wretched , wonderful smell of Venice . Squawking pigeons , crashing waves created by the motorboats , and the wine-induced laughs of restaurant patrons season our lovemaking and serenade me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clanging of the supply boats delivering water , fish , and clean linens to the restaurant nearby . Everything in Venice is transported item by item on the water , and I never stop finding it odd that there are chicken boats and gelato boats and garbage boats and dirty linen boats . They serve the same purpose as loud , dirty , land-bound trucks but seem so much more elegant , and sleek , and charming . I muse about whether or not there 's a supply boat hierarchy . Do the new guys get stuck with the garbage boat while the seasoned veterans drive the almighty gelato boat , sampling its wares as they float down the streets ? <p> He asks me to leave the apartment early every morning when he goes to work on one of the islands . I then escape to many small , silent corners in Venice , which receive no visitors , no chattering tourists . There are more visitors in the city than Venetians themselves , and after so many months here I welcome any respite from the masses of foreigners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent hiding from tourists and finding shelter from the cold . Reluctantly I trek along the well-beaten tourist path from the Rialto , past Strada Nova onto the Rio Terra S. Leonardo but then find refuge in the lonely , deserted Ghetto , where I sit and feed the pigeons . <p> I have also claimed a small area in Sant'Elena 's waterfront park as my own for the majority of the afternoon , until the acqua alta ends at two or three o'clock . Few tourists come here so you will find no tennis shoes or trinket shops . This park lies past the wide , lively via Garibaldi and the picturesque Giardini , far from the teeming crowds of the Riva degli Schiavoni down near San Marco . While the tourists splash around down there , I watch the vaporetti chug back and forth to Lido and make conversation with the locals I see there every day without fail . <p> When early evening comes , I watch the boats run up and down the Grand Canal from my favorite bench in Campo San Vio . What is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canal ? Do the old , historic families of Venice still live in them ? I imagine that by now most belong to the rich and pompous who use them as summer homes but let them sit unused , vacant , and unloved when the inconvenient winter seizes the city . <p> Increasingly , it seems that the only people who can afford to live here are vacuous , elite jet-setters . These bores keep a swank apartment in Venice or a beach house on Lido just to be able to say they have a home in Venice , even if they are never here . They are not Venetians ; they have no legitimate claim to this city . For the most part , they do not truly care for her ; she is merely an accessory and a status symbol to them . The artists , poets , and true lovers of Venice , along with the Venetians themselves , are all being pushed out to create a fairytale land . Soon , the only people to inhabit these islands will be the tourists , who come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rich and beautiful , who hold seasonal balls for the sole purpose of talking about how rich and beautiful they are . <p> I am afraid that Venice is dying from neglect . The rich landlords and vacationing masses come and give Venice love for a week , maybe a month , but they eventually go home and forget about her . Does anyone pay attention to the very fact that she is crumbling ? She is losing her natives , her Venetian families . They are moving to the mainland to make room for foreigners with money . She has glorious palaces with brilliant facades that hold no life , no people inside . They hold art treasures and remnants of glories past , but where are the glories of today ? Are the colored confetti of Carnevale and cheap trinket stands going to be the legacy of this century ? Will the Venice of the Venetians die and become a sea of hotels and tourist restaurants that serve soggy pizza ? Maybe she is already dead and I am here just to participate in the funeral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stink . <p> But this is not Venice 's fault . As much as I am lost and despondent here , I can not blame Venice for anything ; I love her too much . I hate what she has done to me ; she has seduced me into believing I need her to live . Where else can one live after one has seen Venice ? What else could I have done ? I hate what I have done to myself ; I have abandoned reason and rational thinking to run away to the only place that inspires me and fills me with the will to keep living . Even as a shell of her former self , she gives me a glimmer of hope , a feeling that beautiful things still exist . <p> Carnevale has recently ended , and as usual this means cranky shopkeepers and prices triple what they were the week before Carnevale started . I was n't able to pay the prices the pensione owners asked for a simple , single room , but my Venetian host was feeling generous and let me stay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , joyous , festive time , but my cynical side tells me it is nothing more than a gross commercialization of a tradition that is supposed to be meaningful . Most visitors do n't even participate in Carnevale ; they come only to look at it and to photograph it . It is captivating , but if you scratch the surface you 'll find little else than an excuse for a rate hike in the middle of the winter low season and a reason to repaint the gondola moorings . <p> Still , there remains a hint of history , even a hint of magic that surrounds Carnevale . I have often imagined that the masked , ample-bosomed courtesans , their handsome gentlemen callers , the colorful jesters and the corseted Venetian noblewomen who all glide through the streets are not modern day aberrations at all , but the ghosts of centuries gone by . I meet them late at night , in the lonesome streets of Dorsoduro or near the Fenice . They glance at me and pass nervously , aware that I know their secret . I know they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , who come to life once each year to live as they lived so many years before . Winding their way through the labyrinth of Venice , they go to meet friends long gone and blend into the festive crowd of tourists , but I know they are no tourists . Floating through the city stealthily , beautifully , they come back to their beloved Venezia and carouse with the living before shortly returning to the shadows , the cold ground , the water from whence they came . <p> Maybe I 've passed long-forgotten Doges dressed in black satin and lace , with hideous masks betraying their identities . They may now walk beside the most common of merchants , or proudly drift through the halls of the Palazzo Ducale once again . With how many ghosts of condemned prisoners have I walked ? Walking through those dank prisons in the Palazzo Ducale , I could almost hear the despairing cries of the dying , doomed men . There I realized how cruel and ruthless Venice can be . I wandered through the small , freezing cells that see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only imagine the stench of death , of dying , of desperate men who lost everything at the whims of a few powerful leaders . How many ghosts of tortured , maimed men still haunt those cells , these streets ? Maybe they 've all returned to the city that scorned them , free once more to gaze upon her beauty and breathe in all of her life , if only for those few days of Carnevale . I can not escape death in Venice , whether in the form of living ghosts or eerie island cemeteries or reminders ( such as Santa Maria della Salute ) of the horrifying plagues that hit the city long ago . Death is permanently carved into every church in Venice . I can feel the spirits of the past as I walk across their sober stone grave markers in San Zaccharia , or gaze upon their carved marble memorials in the Frari . Even the hushed whispers of ancient confessions and prayers still float up to the domed ceilings and echo throughout the chapels and past the altar , until they reach my ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in every church in Venice , although I am godless . My coins rattle in the offering boxes at the entrances and I take my place in the pews , but I can not buy any of what the church is selling . Although I do not believe , the idea of religion is so novel to me ! I am in love with the idea of an omniscient power who watches over and protects you , promising eternal happiness if you only believe in him and have faith in his great scheme . <p> When I sit inside San Marco and stare at the shining , mosaic-filled ceilings I am tempted to throw myself on the altar and beg God and the priests to make me believe . Ca n't they give me some sign of proof as if I were the second Saul ? The serene Madonnas and paintings of a suffering Christ mesmerize and fascinate me , but do not convince me . If only I could make myself believe , maybe then I would have something , anything , to depend upon , like so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the hard stoops of the marble pillars and watch the faithful file in and out . They cross themselves , solemnly praying , clutching their precious rosaries as if they are made of diamonds . At least when the rest of their life falls apart , they always have their God to turn to for comfort . <p> The churches close at night and God turns me onto the street again to return to my humble pensione room or wander to my lover 's house . Sometimes I ride the late , deserted vaporetti up and down the Grand Canal , or to Lido , then back to Sant'Elena where an empty , quiet bench is always available . Alone on these late boats , I have spent hours shivering in the wind , wondering what goes on in the imposing but airy buildings that line that great canal . Do the people in those buildings fight , cry , hurt as deeply as I ? I can see them clearly in the windows during their candle-lit masquerades as I glide by below them . Powdered women and chivalrous men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Their lives seem to me so out of reach , so glorious and lighthearted , so far from mine . Yet I am only just outside , a lonely , ticketless vaporetto rider peering in at them , inspecting them while they continue , blissfully unaware of my presence . I must cross paths with these very people every day , even share calle and campo space with them . Maybe those are the very men that glance at me seductively as I pass and brush against me as I pick fruit from vendors ' stalls , but we are as far in spirit as the moon is to the sun . They seem to have everything ; I feel I have nothing left . <p> Tonight I rode down to the train station , only to buy an orange and bottle of water from the overpriced fruit stand just off the waterfront . The tired African merchants still peddle their wares on the Lista di Spagna but everything else is quiet , and the stores are shut down until tomorrow morning 's light . Before crossing the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scalzi bridge for a while , alone , watching the lights glitter off the Grand Canal . Everything looks so perfect from there . <p> So I 've found myself here once again , in my corte del Diavolo , to think , to reflect , to wonder . I am due at my lover 's house in just a half hour so I should start my slow walk through Santa Croce into San Polo and over the Rialto . I 'll finally reach his door shortly after the campanile rings midnight . The thought of spending another night with him sickens me , but I 've few other alternatives . I will freeze if I stay outside , and a pensione will cost too much money . I need to save my precious lire , and as wicked as he may be , his hospitality costs nothing . <p> I feel like I am dying inside , just like Venice , my beautiful mother . We both show our attractive facades , but we are maintained by the weakest of supports , that could collapse at a moment 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Venice can no longer act as a salve for a wound that 's too deep to heal . Would my death in Venice give me the happiness I could n't find in life ? If I disappear into the night , into the fog , no one will miss me , no one will remember me , no one will look for me . I do n't want to be another faceless , average soul who is content to live and die in obscurity , but is it better to live a meaningless life or die a meaningless death ? Each one is equally pitiful . <p> My entire life has been spent chasing the moonlight . I 've been trying to grab it and hold it close and carry it in my pocket as I would carry a stone or a coin . But the moonlight , though all around me , slips through my fingers when I am near . My hopes ca n't be carried anymore , and I am tired of them . My moonlight , my dreams , ca n't be grasped , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only I knew that my death here in Venice would liberate me from my troubles and let me become an eternal spirit that travels the islands and whispers to everyone who comes here . Then I would do it , I would wrap myself in Venice 's deep , watery bosom and end the chase here , in my secret corner . I would become a phantom and haunt these old stone streets forever , as so many others do . I would float through the palaces and silently dine with the rich old families of Venice , or swoop down and steal a kiss from a beautiful , muscled gondolier . I might even sit on the top of the campanile and dangle my legs over the edge , carelessly , joyfully , and watch the boats sail back and forth all day , every dayendlessly . <p>
