He staggers like a drunken salaryman on a midnight commuter train out of Tokyo Station . This is what he likes best yet dreads most about American women : You can never tell , even with the ones you think you know , what they 're going to do next . THE RESTAURANT WAS DESIGNED BY A FAMOUS BRITISH architect , Jane tells him as the tubular glass elevator descends eleven floors below street level .

Hugh , who is making a documentary film about the rice riots , smiles at Toshi relentlessly , as if he is trying to make him feel comfortable . It has the opposite effect . He likes Hugh 's wife , though . Lucy is a composer . Tall and broad-shouldered , with hair as short as his , she looks like someone he 'd want to talk to if he saw her at a party . Every time their eyes meet she leans almost imperceptively across the table , as if she has something fascinating she wants to say to him . But he looks away , flustered . He 's never met a composer . What are they like ? he wonders as Jane refills his wineglass , then rests her hand on his thigh . Romantic ? Moody ? Unpredictable , he guesses . It is Jane , though , whose behavior bewilders him . Twice she bursts into tears and excuses herself from the table . Is she sick , or has something terrible occurred ? Hugh and Lucy stare down at their plates and say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their salads , a strolling guitar player stops behind Jane 's chair and strums " The Tennessee Waltz . " She starts to cry again . " I know what you 're thinking , " she sobs . " I invited you and now I 'm ruining your birthday dinner . You must think I 'm awful . " Before he can say anything , she runs off to the toilet . There 's a long , uncomfortable silence at the table . " She probably has a flu or something , " Lucy says .  | " Oh , she 's not sick . Physically , anyway , " Hugh says . Lucy gives him a sharp look , which he does n't notice . " She 's just freaking out because she was having a wild affair with her ikebana teacher . " Hugh smiles widely , exposing shiny gums .

But the room lights dim . Four waiters carry a candlelit cake to the table and sing " Happy Birthday " in English . When they are done , everyone in the restaurant applauds . Toshi is embarrassed by the attention . " Now blow out the candles , all at once , " Lucy says . She leans over the green tea tiramisu cake and purses her lips to demonstrate , and she looks so funny that Toshi laughs . She laughs too . " No , really . It 's an American tradition . You blow out the candles , then you close your eyes and make a wish . But if you miss a candle , your wish wo n't come true . " A wish ?

He blows out the candles and closes his eyes , but he is so drunk that he is unnerved by the sudden darkness and by the images impressed on his eyelids : Lucy puckers her lips , Jane weeps . He opens his eyes before he can think of a wish , and Lucy and Hugh applaud . A waiter takes the cake away to be cut . Jane returns dry-eyed from the bathroom , and apologizes again . Then she and Lucy and Hugh all start talking at once , very fast . They race to tell one another stories of their own birthdays , the parties they had growing up , parties their parents gave them . Toshi does n't tell any stories . His English is n't that good , and he still has n't mastered the skill most essential for talking with Americans  --  how to interrupt . Jane and Hugh and Lucy talk as if they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after familiar words  --  mother , awful , divorce  --  and strings them together . Drunk , he struggles for connections and for meaning , constructing scenes from American movies he has seen . Fat white children in pointed hats . Bursting balloons . Cakes as big as tatami mats . A silver rocketship you could slice with a knife and eat . And birthday presents . So many presents to unwrap and hold up like prizes . But at the parties Jane and her friends recall , and in the movies he 's seen , there are also arguments . Be-  | tween children and parents , between parent and parent . There are drunken uncles . There are broken toys and sobbing aunts . " And they put him in jail overnight , " is how Hugh ends one of his stories as the slices of cake arrive .

The stories continue over cups of Viennese coffee topped with swirls of whipped cream that sag from the heat . Disappointments pile on top of disasters . It seems to Toshi that while Japanese take pains to present cheerful pictures of their families to strangers , Jane and her friends offer up their unhappy childhoods like movie plots , or like gifts : They unwrap and display them with something resembling pride . After dinner , they ride the glass elevator up eleven floors  --  past an underground batting center , past a blowfish restaurant of thatched-roofed teahouses set in a subterranean forest of bamboo and bathed in artificial moonlight  --  and surface on a narrow street lined with pachinko parlors and karaoke bars . " Look ! " Lucy says , peering in the window of a beer hall with a Swiss chalet facade . Inside , two women in strapless dresses snowplow down a tiny ski slope .

But she only whispers , " I have a special birthday present for you , but I could n't bring it to the restaurant . Why do n't you come back to my apartment ?

" If you 're sure it 's okay , " he says . " Do n't be so Japanese . I would n't have asked if it was n't . " She raises her bare arm and flutters her fingers . A taxi door springs open . While the driver is watching the news on the dashboard TV  --  two more rice farmers and a Buddhist monk starved to death at the hunger strike in front of the Ministry of Agriculture  --  he sails through a red light and bumps a Pizza Hut delivery boy off his motor scooter .

And that 's when he wonders if she will be his new American girlfriend . Jane would n't be Toshi 's first American girlfriend . He has had two since he moved to Tokyo . Before Jane , there was Wanda Williford . Before Wanda , Sally Youngblood . In Sapporo , where he went to college , there was , in his last year , the exchange student Patty Shapiro , who had a cat also named Patty .  | He has never had a Japanese girlfriend , not even when he was in high school and there were only Japanese girls to choose from . He never wanted one . What Toshiyuki Okamoto has wanted , has desired , has dreamed erotic dreams about since the day of his ninth birthday , is a girlfriend who looks like the movie star Audrey Hepburn  --  Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday , beginning with the scene in which she walks into a barbershop and gets her long beautiful hair sheared off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school let out , he took the bus across the thawing peninsula to Utoro . From the bus window he looked down on the small fishing village where his mother lived  --  a cluster of low , steep-roofed buildings on a dark fist of granite that curled out into a darker sea . The inn was quiet . His mother was in the kitchen washing rice for dinner . Sunlight and cold air poured in the open windows . Pushing her sleeves up past her elbows , she plunged her hands into the glassy water . She asked him to go to the movies with her in Shari.  | He leaned over the sink and watched chalky powder swirl up through her fingers . The water clouded , and stray grains floated to the top . " But I 'm going up to the hills with my friends , to catch foxes , " he said . After the winter , the red foxes walked out of the woods and sunned themselves along the roadside . They were half-asleep and still stunned from the cold . You could walk right up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limp in your arms . You could drape them around your neck . " The snow 's almost all gone . It 's too late to see a fox in a tree . " Smiling , his mother lifted her red hands out of the water and shook them over the sink . She 'd told him this story often when he was younger : In the winter the snow was so high that the foxes walked across its surface and slept in the branches of the soft pines , nesting like birds . While they slept the snow melted , and when they woke up they could n't get down . " What 's the movie ? " " An old American one . It 's very famous . " " But it 's in English . I wo n't understand it . " " Movie subtitles are easy . And it will be fun to go together , wo n't it ? " She turned on the tap water . She plunged her hands in again , and her fingers disappeared into the pearly grains like bare feet into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They passed a thermos of green tea back and forth while up on the screen Audrey Hepburn walked into a barbershop in Rome and had her beautiful hair cut off . In the seats around them , middle-aged women and high school girls opened wooden lunch boxes of grilled eel , rice , and pickled radish . They reached down into shopping bags for their potato cutlet sandwiches , grilled rice balls wrapped in seaweed , and damp cakes filled with sweet red bean paste . " Oh , her neck . Look at her neck . Is n't it lovely ? " his mother whispered while the Italian barber fell in love with Audrey Hepburn and asked her to go dancing with him down by the river . Toshi looked up at his mother and , turning around in his seat , at the chattering women in the theater , the wives and daughters of fishermen , farmers , and loggers . Their broad , weathered faces tilted up toward the screen , their mouths filled with gold and silver teeth , stuffed with potatoes and rice . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life by a shimmering Audrey Hepburn . Audrey happy . Audrey mad . Audrey dancing by the river with her barber . Audrey so sad it almost broke Toshi ' s heart . He took off his shoes and squatted on the seat , stared so hard at Audrey Hepburn that his forehead hurt . Whenever she disappeared from the screen , even if only for a moment , he could n't sit still , rocked from  | side to side looking for her . Where was she ? What was she doing ? " Do you need to go to the toilet ? " his mother asked . Toshi was only nine years old , but he could see the difference between those women in the movie theater and the woman up on the screen . And he knew , and his little penis knew , which he preferred . On his ninth birthday , Toshiyuki Okamoto experienced the first important , the first truly rhapsodic , erection of his young life . It sprang to attention in the haircut scene and beat like a heart for Audrey Hepburn throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly during the credits . IT 'S THE MILK , " HIS MOTHER TOLD HIM . SHE TOOK her handkerchief out of her purse , unfolded a daisy chain of Mickey and Minnie Mouses , and smoothed it out on her lap . It was still early , and they were the only customers in the restaurant . Behind the counter , the chef watched TV as he lifted dripping slices of green pepper and sweet potato out of the batter bowl and dropped them into hot oil , where they sizzled.  | " Foreigners drink lots of milk growing up . That 's why they 're so tall and good-looking . " Her dinner arrived , two giant tempura prawns on top of a bowl of glossy rice . She picked at it with her chopsticks without really noticing it . " After the war , we did n't have real milk . There was only powdered milk from the Americans . And it was so expensive . " Toshi listened carefully , for his mother rarely talked about her life before he knew her . " When we first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when we did n't have television ? ? almost everything we watched was from America . On American television , people drank milk all the time . They drank it like water , they drank it from big glass bottles , like it was free . " She rested her chopsticks on her pickle plate and absently wiped her mouth with her Mickey and Minnie Mouse handkerchief . " I used to cry when I watched Americans drink milk on television . " The waitress brought Toshi ' s dinner , and the CocaCola he 'd ordered . " Mother , " he whispered , embarrassed that the waitress might hear him . " I do n't want Coke . I want a glass of milk . Ask her to change it . Please . " " They do n't have milk here . Drink your Coke . I 'll buy you some milk later . " " Mother ? " " What ? "  | " What about before the war ? Did you have big bottles of milk to drink before the war ? " He watched as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers out on the table 's edge as if to steady herself . Toshi braced himself for an earthquake , but none came . She did n't say anything , and it seemed to him as if everything else suddenly went quiet too . The TV on the counter , the trickle of early evening traffic outside . Just when he thought he might have done something wrong , she spoke . " Before the war there was nothing . There was no ' before the war . ' Now eat your dinner before it gets cold . " She turned to watch the TV on the counter . The street door slid open . The blue curtains parted , and Audrey Hepburn walked into the restaurant . Her hair was short . " Hello , " she said . " My , what a handsome young boy you are . And your tempura looks so delicious . May I try some ? " She sat down in the empty chair next to his , gracefully , like a princess . " I 'm so lonely , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I could come and take care of you . " Audrey Hepburn smiled at Toshi . She was so beautiful it took his breath away . " I could bathe you , and I 'd scrub your back . We could take a bath together . " Toshi looked at his mother . She was removing a  | prawn 's tail from her mouth with her fingers as she watched TV : The studio audience applauded as a girl in a bikini poured cartons of milk all over her body , then stepped inside a glass booth filled with kittens . " Oh , yes , " he said to Audrey Hepburn . " Yes , please come home and take a bath with me . " NOW THAT IT 'S YOUR BIRTHDAY , I DO N'T KNOW what to do .... " Jane sings as she slips down under the sheets . Her soft head of hair vanishes as she nibbles her way down his chest and stomach . " Ca n't give you a Cadillac or a penthouse with a view .... " Still serenading him as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An animal from America I do n't know yet . She keeps singing , but now she slurs the words . Anyway , Toshi is n't listening anymore . A red scarf is draped over the lampshade , and a quivering light reveals framed woodblock prints on the walls of Jane 's apartment : Geishas draw back the folds of their kimo-  | nos . Curtains of colored silk . Green , yellow , plum . Tempting . The skin of ripe fruit peeled back to display the pulp . The geishas smile with blackened teeth as they are entered by samurai , swords unsheathed , robes and sashes flung back and suspended in midair . He is having drunken visions . Jane 's futon is crowded with naked women  --  pale breasts , sweaty triangles of blond hair , damp darkness behind the knee where he buries his head . The powdery fold of an arm envelops him . Toshi feels Jane 's fingernails tear at the skin on his backside , as they roll off the futon onto the kitchen linoleum and crash into a shopping bag of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young , bare-shouldered Audrey . Sabrina . She runs across a sweeping lawn at night toward the lights and the music , her cranelike neck stretched forward , her neck white as milk . " Oh , what I 've done , " Jane laughs . " This must be against the rules . " They are lying side by side in the dark . It 's the middle of the night . Toshi , exhausted , tentatively explores his own body , discovers bruises , scratches , and bites . He winces each time he touches a new one , yet he is more astonished than disturbed by sex with Jane . " What 's against the rules ? " he asks . His eyes are open , but he sees nothing in the darkness . He is aware of the greasy smell of her tiny kitchen behind them , and of her voice . And then a thought flickers briefly : Could she hurt me ? Could sex with Jane be dangerous ?  | " A teacher seducing her student . If the school finds out , they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smiles at him . " Or maybe all of my students will want to sleep with me . " He shuts his eyes , opens them , and reaches out to touch the albino tiger on her breast . He 's never known a woman with a tattoo . " Students and teachers often sleep together in Japan . Even in high school , " he says . Jane laughs . " You 're lying to make me feel better . " She picks up a pack of Cheerful cigarettes from the floor , shakes one out into her mouth . " Jane , Jane . She 's an evil seductress . A corrupter of children . " " I 'm twenty-three . I 'm not a child . " She lights her cigarette , snaps the lighter shut . " Jane is thirty . A cradle robber .

" he asks , purposely distracting her , disturbed by the image , and by her use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does sex change usage ? " You do n't like it ? " She shifts her weight to her elbow so that the tiger rests on his arm . Her breast is cool . " It 's my animal . The Year of the Tiger . My last boyfriend forced me to get it . He got me drunk and then dragged me to this tattooist . He ordered me to do it . " " He ordered you ? " The way she 's smiling , is she making up a story for him ?  | " I often find myself with men who order me to do things . " He does n't say anything . She exhales smoke in his face , then puts out her cigarette . He shuts his eyes . " Would you order me to do things ? " she asks , stroking the inside of his leg . His penis flip-flops onto his thigh like a fish . Once he and Taro were fishing , and Taro caught a salmon so big it flipped over in the boat and landed on Taro 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the most incredible skin . I ca n't stop touching it . It gives me goose bumps . Feel ? " She leans over and presses the tiger against his face , and he does feel the bumps rising on her breast . He gasps for air . She slides down and bites him hard . Just before dawn , Toshi wakes up , and for a moment he thinks he is back in Rausu , above the noodle shop . And he remembers : three narrow mattresses laid side by side , the edges touching , Toshi in the middle . THE PILLOWS WERE HARD , STUFFED WITH BUCKWHEAT husks . In the winter , the three of them shared two old  | wool blankets that crackled when his mother took them from the closet each night . Asleep , his parents rolled toward the middle , toward him , for warmth . His father snored , exhaling tobacco , soy sauce , and beer . His mother sweated green tea and miso . Sometimes she 'd sigh a name . Toshi . Fumio , his father . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language . And she wept in her sleep . Dreaming , she 'd toss about as if at sea , her restlessness waking him . Toshi drifted in and out of sleep , back and forth between his parents . Away from his father 's stink into his mother 's moist sadness and back again to his father . In the summer he and his father slept in their cotton underwear . But even on the hottest nights , his mother wore a nightgown and pulled the sheet up to her chin . He never saw her body . Some nights , his snoring fa-ther 's penis poked out of his shorts and bobbed like the mast on a fishing boat . Once Toshi awoke to see his father erect , his hand sliding up and down . His eyes were squeezed tightly shut , and from the terrible expression on his face and from his loud breathing , Toshi thought he was having a nightmare . He looked as if he were running away from something . At twenty-three , Toshi 's childhood memories of his father are as remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives  --  images from an old film he might have seen on television . His father stands at the end of the road , the flat sea on one side , the noodle  | shop on the other , bowing as a customer drives away . He wears a white apron , and his hair is cropped close as an athlete 's , the sides shaved right down to his skull . His wristwatch flashes in the sunlight like a gold tooth . The road is gravel , and the departing car stirs up dust . The car is white . Back then , all cars in Japan were white . The white car and white apron . Dust . The masts of the fishing boats bobbing and nodding . The hills of the Russian islands dim as dreams . His father bows and shouts , " Thank you . Drive carefully . Thank you . Please come again . Thank you very much . " He bows over and over again as the driver , who can not possibly see or hear him any longer , disappears down the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more vivid and more troubling . Sometimes they are illuminated by dazzling winter sunlight . They walk together along plowed roads after the first snow , following the skittering tracks of antelope . The world has been turned upside down , she tells him as she points out a stand of white birch whose leafless trunks and branches stretch up out of the snow like frosty roots into the blue sky . Under the snow , where the black bears sleep , fantastic trees are in bloom , she says . And he believes her . But on many other days : a slate sky over a colorless sea . His mother sits motionless and silent at the back window while the teakettle whistles on and on .  | Toshi was eight when his mother left them to go live at the inn in Utoro , where she had been working weekends for a year . His father closed the noodle shop to drive her to the bus stop , and Toshi went along , sitting in the backseat of their shiny white car . His father kept the car washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Utoro . There 's time before dinner , " he said as they drove down the coast road , passing three naked old women . The mother of the butcher and the sisters who ran the laundry waddled like sea lions over the dark rocks toward the narrow strip of beach , where bubbling pools of hot spring water sent up clouds of steam . Toshi could smell the sulphur through the closed windows . " That 's too much trouble . The bus is fine , " his mother said . They did n't say anything else until they reached the bus stop and she opened the car door . " Better to wait in the car . It 's cold out , " his father said . " It 's all right . The bus will be here soon . " She opened the trunk and lifted out her big suitcase and shoulder bag . His mother was a strong woman . She 'd lifted mattresses , cartons of radishes and onions . Buckets of water . Toshi . She carried her luggage to the bus shelter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made a crunching sound . Each step she took away from him , Toshi winced with pain .  | She came back to the car , opened the door , and looked hard at him . He wanted to turn away . " You help your father in the shop . " " Yes , I will , " he said , holding back his tears . In the front seat , his father turned around to watch them . " And do your schoolwork . " " Yes . " " Saturdays , after school , you come over on the bus and spend the night . Your father will bring you to the bus every Saturday , all right ? " " All right , " he said . What choice did he have ? Who decided that his mother should leave ? She looked at his father . " Thank you for driving me . " " Take good care of yourself , " he said . " If you need anything , you call me . " His father 's face was so rigid it looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't bear to look at him . He turned to his mother . Her lips trembled , parting slightly as if there was something she was struggling to say . But no words came out . Snow clouds over the Russian islands moved quickly toward them . The three of them waited  --  for the bus , for the snow , for their lives to change  --  under a mute winter sky . At last , she spoke . " I 'm sorry . " His father 's head fell forward so suddenly it startled Toshi . It was as if the weight of it was intolerable . He shut his eyes and did n't answer her . She turned back to Toshi , in his bright yellow school  | cap and red mittens , pressed tight against the seat . She was crying . " Bye-bye , Toshi-chan . " His mother waited but he , too , refused to reply . She closed the door and walked back to the bus shelter , her boots cracking the ice .

HE TELLS JANE THE STORY , HOW HIS MOTHER LEFT , HOW he still remembers details : Driving home without her . Toshi alone in the backseat , waiting for his father to say something . His father silent . The smell of sulphur as they passed the hot springs again . He climbed the stairs to the front room while his father stayed down in the noodle shop . Looking out the window at the falling snow and the sea , he listened to the steady rocking of the knife blade on the cutting board , like waves breaking on the shore . Jane shakes her head . " That 's so sad . That 's an awful story . I think I might cry . " They are sitting naked at her kotatsu , their bare feet  | touching under the thick quilt . She pours strong coffee into Japanese tea bowls . Dusty sunlight streams in through the high windows , lighting up the room and the framed woodblock prints . He was n't imagining them last night . Toshi pulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest . " You mean your mother did n't even kiss you or hug you when she left ? She just walked away ? " " My mother never kissed or hugged me , " he says , and he tries to remember , Did his mother ever touch him at all , for any reason ? Jane is rubbing the inside of his thighs with her warm feet , so it 's difficult to concentrate , to think about his mother . " But did n't you want her to ? That day ? Would n't it have made you feel better ? " She slides over to stroke his hair , then his hard penis , as if to comfort him , so many years later . His American girlfriends always do this for him : try to make up for what they decide he 's missed in his life . Briefly he remembers the shame of a schoolboy whose mother left him behind . He shivers as Jane bends over and takes him in her mouth . He feels her hand slide up the crack in his ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tenses . This is something new . " If she had touched me that day , " he says , his voice tight and high , " I would have known for sure that something was wrong . "  | THE ABRUPT TRANSITION INTO BRIGHT SUNLIGHT . THREE children on bicycles ride up and down the narrow lane in front of Jane 's building , laughing . A girl in a pink dress skips down the lane , towing a unicycle . " Yumi-chan ! Good morning ! " her friends shout . " Good morning ! Good morning ! " She mounts her unicycle confidently , and they all ride circles around Toshi as he walks toward the main street . He is startled by the light , by the cheerful children , and by the potted red geraniums and powdery green aloe vera , by the flower boxes of tulips lined up in front of each house . Morning glory vines stretch up a homemade wire lattice . High above his head , mattresses and quilts float like clouds out of bedroom windows . White undershirts flap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane . He feels uneasy , as if he has made a mistake , or has unintentionally done something he should n't have . Suddenly , he longs for Hokkaido 's wide , clear skies . Even now , scattered clouds threaten to end this spring morn-ing 's sunshine . He does n't want to go home , so he walks past the subway station , keeps on walking , in and out of unfamiliar neighborhoods , looking for dis- p 33 tractions . Pretty housewives in jeans and aprons hurry along the streets with grocery bags , their white sneakers smacking the pavement . He still does n't know Tokyo above ground , how its parts relate , so he follows distant landmarks . The hotels of Akasaka , the metallic skyscrapers of Shinjuku . He passes doughnut shops and noodle stands . A shopkeeper washes down the sidewalk with a bucket of water , then hangs out his blue curtain . Toshi turns corners to be delighted : yellow plastic clothespins clipped to a fence top like a row of tropical birds . The scaffolding of a new building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their flaring pantaloons like wings . A tall black man in brilliant African robes sits in the window of a Mc-Donald 's drinking coffee .

He crosses the street to a grassy slope lined with cherry trees . Down below , on a tennis court , girls in white dart around like petals scattered by the wind . He can hear the pleasing thwack of the balls . Behind the court , a subway train emerges from a tunnel and pulls up to the station platform . Toshi has never been in this part of the city , and he feels like a tourist , like he did the first time he saw Tokyo . Excited yet uneasy . Waiting for something to happen . This morning , he senses , is caught just be-  | tween the seasons . The train doors open to reveal small groups of schoolgirls chattering and laughing , clusters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeze . Toshi stands above them , unsure of himself , trying to decide which way to go . WHEN HE WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD , TOSHI TRAVeled to Tokyo to take the entrance examination for the National Art University . " Tokyo is a big city . Be careful , " his mother said on the telephone the morning he left . " Please do n't worry . " " You 've never been out of Hokkaido . You do n't know about life . People are n't all nice . " Her warning did n't surprise him . His mother had always been suspicious of the world . There were things about her he accepted but would never understand . His father drove him to the airport in Nakashibetsu . They drove in silence down the peninsula , then inland . They watched the mountains disappear behind them and the land flatten out . The forest ended , p 35 replaced by farms and ranches , and in every direction there were only silver grain silos on the horizon , and tight herds of rice white Hokkaido cows stomping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter , the dark earth deserted except for scarecrows clothed in old baseball uniforms , flapping uselessly in the cold wind . " I 've never been on an airplane , " his father said . " This is my first time , " Toshi said . It was always awkward when they found themselves together outside of the noodle shop or their rooms upstairs . They stood inside the small terminal , waiting for Toshi 's flight to be called . The concrete building seemed to float on the frozen prairie below the blue sky . His father bought a can of hot coffee from a vending machine . Toshi 's blue and white school duffel bag hung around his neck on a wide strap . He rocked back and forth on his heels , and the bag bounced against his stomach , a comforting weight . His father handed him an envelope . " Your life will be much different from mine . It already is , I guess . " He opened it . It was filled with ten-thousand-yen notes . " Father , this is too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's very expensive in Tokyo , people say . "  | He put the envelope in his pocket and bowed . " Thank you . " " Do your best . " " Yes . I will try hard . " " And after the examination is over , go out and have a good time . " His flight was announced . Toshi and his father looked at each other . Neither of them smiled . The Emperor was dying . The plane was filled with passengers clutching tiny Japanese flags , red suns on white . As they approached Tokyo , the rice fields and dense clusters of houses and apartment buildings abruptly ended and gave way to rolling turf and narrow stands of trees . Golf courses surrounded the city like a brilliant green moat . Toshi watched from the window as Tokyo itself came into view , an absence of color like the insides of an enormous machine . The immensity frightened him . He felt the plane suddenly drop down , and he grabbed the armrests , thinking something had gone wrong . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags , collecting paper cups and candy wrappers , and chatting with the passengers . The no-smoking sign lit up . Pushing through the crowds and commotion in the terminal , Toshi fought off unexpected feelings of loneliness and confusion : so many faces , and dialects he barely understood . The Emperor 's gaunt visage was on the cover of every magazine and newspaper .  | TV monitors showed crowds waiting in the rain outside the Imperial Palace , praying , and waving their tiny flags . An old farmer and his wife prostrated themselves in front of a monitor and shouted , " Banzai ! Banzai ! " Passengers and baggage handlers and counter clerks bowed , their flags falling forward all at once like a flock of seagulls alighting . Confused , Toshi bowed too . His duffel bag swung out into space . White-gloved hands shoved him in through the doors of the airport monorail , and he pressed his face to the glass as the train emerged from the station , then sped past factories and smokestacks , a deserted race track , muddy baseball diamonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced on the edge of space and swung their gleaming clubs . Gray canals crisscrossed under gray , congested roads under a gray sky . He looked for trees . He suddenly felt homesick . Nothing was familiar except for the names , huge letters on the roofs of warehouses and glass and steel office buildings : Sony . Panasonic . Coca-Cola . The train glided into the station , and Toshi was unnerved : There were more people waiting on the platform than all the people who lived in Rausu and Utoro combined . Toshi wore his high school uniform as required : black shoes polished , new white socks , black pants and jacket freshly pressed and buttoned up to the neck .  | In his pants pockets , he fingered a good luck charm that Granny had ordered from a shrine in Tohoku that specialized in amulets for school entrance exams . Before he entered the auditorium , he removed his black cap , bowed , and had his head shaved and his underwear checked . " Regulation white . " The guard nodded and stamped a sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected because her braided hair had red highlights . She burst into tears . " Please . I beg you . I live in Okinawa . It 's from the sun . " " Go dye it black and come back next year , " the guard told her . Except for English and art classes , Toshi had never been much of a student . Halfway through the examination , he knew he would n't pass . Still , there was something reassuring about sitting in a huge auditorium with students from all over Japan dressed exactly as he was . They wore name tags pinned to their jackets . There were dozens of Yamamotos , Ishikawas , Tanakas , Matsudas , Muratas . He had counted at least six other Okamotos . Could they be related ? His parents had told him he had no relatives . When the exam was over , four students carried a giant photo of the Emperor onto the stage , and they all stood in a groundswell . He stood , too , then knelt and pressed his forehead to the gritty floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The flag is a symbol of the military . The Emperor is responsible for the Pacific War , " one boy shouted . A monitor slapped him repeatedly on the face , backing him down the aisle past Toshi . WATANABE , his name tag read . The big metal doors slammed shut , echoed through the cavernous hall . " What an idiot , " someone whispered . " Now he ca n't go to college . " Toshi felt the same way . What difference did it make ? He did n't care about the Emperor one way or another . The Emperor was just an old , sick man . He explored the city . In Seibu department store , people shopped for clothes and furniture , had their teeth fixed , bought houses and Hawaiian vacations . There was a wedding chapel on the seventh floor . In the basement , housewives crowded around bins of fresh crabs flown in from Alaska , mangoes from the Philippines , melons packed in velvet that sold for ten thousand yen each . And they bought them ! There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the department stores had galleries . He recognized the French Impressionists ' paintings , but most everything else  --  a glass-enclosed ant farm modeled on the Japanese flag ; six-foot-high , chrome rabbits ; a room webbed with rope  --  confounded him . At Parco department store in Shibuya , an American photogra-pher 's pictures of naked black men and longstemmed flowers . This was art ? Toshi drew pictures  | of fishing boats , forests , his father . The gallery was crowded with people , but still he felt he was seeing something forbidden , and that excited him . He was fascinated by the mammoth train stations , bigger than towns , millions of people passing through them every day . Ueno . Tokyo . Ikebukuro . The morning after the examination , he ate his breakfast in Shinjuku Station . He stood at a coffee bar with a bean paste  --  filled doughnut in his hand and watched commuters pour out of the trains with their briefcases , comic books , newspapers , and rolled umbrellas . How could he go back to Rausu ? he won-dered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emblazoned with cigarette brand names  --  Shiny Stars , Clean Spirit , Lark  --  pressed sample packs into his hands before he could say , No , thank you . Men in sunglasses stuffed his pockets with packets of facial tissue  --  pictures of bare-breasted girls , advertisements for hostess bars and saunas . Passersby poked him with umbrellas and lit cigarettes and stepped on his new shoes . He hobbled back to the hotel on swollen feet . In his tiny room , he hung up his jacket , which was flecked with cigarette burns . Now he wanted to go home . He bought a beer from a vending machine in the hall , turned on the TV , and sprawled on the bed . A group of children dressed as cockroaches scurried around onstage chased by a giant can of insect repel-  | lent . Running across the bottom of the screen , the day 's body count of dead office workers followed by a warning : " If you are working more than sixteen hours a day and experiencing chest pains , headaches , or shortness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , packed commuter trains crisscrossed a clogged freeway . The afternoon sky was crowded with blimps  --  Fuji Film , Nissan , Sapporo Beer  --  that flashed the dying Emperor 's blood pressure and rectal body temperature . He bought ramen from a vending machine . Exhausted , he looked down into the steaming Styrofoam bowl and saw his father lean over the stove . His mother , before she left them , came through the back door of the noodle shop , her arms filled with ladder ferns , tears streaming down her face . He slept . In his dream , Audrey Hepburn and his mother ran hand in hand through a rice field . There were English words everywhere , in store windows , on neon signs , on billboards : WOMEN 'S . FASHION . SPAGHETTI . FASHION . PIZZA . COFFEE . WHISKEY . AMERICAN JEANS . LET 'S KIOSK . And restaurants and clubs : YES CAFE . CASUAL HOUSE . LOVE BURGER . PIT INN . And there were foreigners in the streets . They darted through the crowds like sleek , dangerous fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bright eyes . Their blue-tinged complexions and long noses seemed assertive , conscious choices ,  | along with their loud voices and exaggerated hand gestures . They pushed through Tokyo 's crowds carelessly , with shocking self-assurance . Seeing them up so close made Toshi giddy . He followed two middleaged women for blocks , in and out of Mitsukoshi department store and through an underground shopping arcade until a poster advertising an English-language school brought him to a sudden stop . A smiling young woman with long blond hair leaned against a surfboard and opened her arms to him . CALIFORNIA KATHY IS ONE OF OUR TEACHERS said the ad for the Very Romantic English Academy . He stared at her picture while rush-hour crowds jostled him . He imagined himself dazzling California Kathy with his command of English . " I like American movies . Do you eat raw fish ? Can you use chopsticks ? " At the souvenir stand inside Tokyo Tower , he bought a guidebook , Where to Spot Foreigners in Tokyo . It fit in his jacket pocket . He sat in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print warnings on the inside cover : 1 . Avoid Caucasian and black men with very short haircuts . They are American soldiers . They often get drunk and violent . 2 . Beware of Asians who try to sell you foreign rice at low prices . Foreign rice is illegal . Also , it is treated with many pesticides that cause serious health problems .  | 3 . Foreigners carry AIDS and other diseases from abroad that are easily transmitted by sharing food and utensils , touching , and , of course , sexual activity . Please be careful ! In high school history class , Toshi had learned how Japan , closed off by law to the rest of the world for centuries , had remained pure while Europe had been devastated by waves of deadly plagues . And in hygiene class , he and his classmates had gasped and tittered when the teacher told them : Foreigners sit in their own dirty bathwater . His spaghetti arrived , topped with sea urchin and shredded seaweed . He sprinkled on grated cheese . Saturday night , he took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his guidebook , foreign models danced in the discos . As the train sped through dark tunnels , he stared furtively at the pictures : exotic women under mirrored lights , their long bare limbs shimmering like wolf willow . Nature studies . Cranes in flight . Heat rose up from vents under the velvet seats and made him sweat . A rowdy group of foreigners scrambled aboard , and the other passengers backed away to make room for their extravagant bodies and raw laughter . Toshi started to move toward them , when he noticed that two of the women were staring at him . He stopped , afraid that something was wrong . But their crayon-  | colored eyes wandered over his body , and they looked at each other and raised their eyebrows . He did n't mistake that look , for he 'd seen it in many American movies . He felt his face redden . Woozy , and suddenly emboldened with a sense of possibility , he stared back . " Roppongi . Roppongi is next , " the conductor 's voice came over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three sumo wrestlers came crashing down the stairs like a tidal wave . Toshi , frightened , ran past them , up toward the exit . He burst out onto the street under the roaring shadow of an elevated freeway . A giant TV screen flickered like summer fireworks , illuminating the crowds . Two stories high , the new prime minister announced his resignation , then bowed low as a stream of numbers raced across his knees : the dying Emperor 's vital signs , followed by the weather . Cloudy . Occasional rain . Instead of his map , Toshi followed light , constellations of bar signs , video screens , traffic signals , the headlights of taxi cabs and motor scooters . The lights of a TV camera crew held high on poles like festival lanterns . " Here 's one ! " the announcer shrieked , and she thrust a microphone into the face of a tall , redheaded foreigner . Red hair ! He 'd never seen red hair before except p 45 in cartoons . His hair reminded Toshi of something . A flash of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lights blinked . The announcer moved in . " Excuse me . Excuse me . You from America ? Yes ? You are ? " " Yes , I 'm American . " He smiled warily . An American ! He did n't know that Americans had red hair . He watched the foreigner 's hand go up to brush the hair back from his forehead , and the pale underside of his arm was incandescent in the lights . The announcer turned to the camera , spoke Japanese : " This man is a genuine American . But look at his hair color . Do you think it 's real ? Maybe he dyes it , I think . We 've just come upon him walking the streets of Roppongi . Perhaps he 's searching for a Japanese girlfriend . I 'll bet he 's headed for a disco right now to pick up a Japanese girl . " The American looked past the announcer , right at Toshi , and rolled his eyes . Startled , Toshi backed away , out of the lights . Why did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The announcer was being rude , but what was he expected to do ? " Excuse me . Excuse me , but do you have AIDS by any chance ? Do you bring AIDS to Japan ? " she shouted , grinning . Everyone looked at the American and waited . Why was everyone so interested in this AIDS ? The Ameri-  | can did n't look sick . He looked healthy . He had a kind , handsome face , Toshi decided . And that hair ! He edged closer again . The American spoke excellent Japanese : " You 're a foolish girl . And very rude . " He leaned over and kissed her on the cheek . " If I have AIDS , now you do , too . " She screamed . " I 'm infected ! " The lights clicked off . " Get me a hot towel , quick ! Get me some anti-septic ! " The cameraman lit a Marlboro . " Just our luck . The producer said no Japanese-speakers . Let 's go look for another foreigner . " The American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Korean barbecue restaurant , a branch of the famous Ginza coffee shop , Cozy Corner . Toshi ran after him . " Wait for me , please , " he shouted , amazed at himself . What was he doing ? They stood in front of the station . " I apologize . It was a terrible way to treat a visitor to Japan . " Toshi bowed , light-headed , his first real encounter with a foreigner . He could n't believe his own courage . Is this what happened to people when they came to Tokyo : They turned into different people ? p 47 " It 's not your fault . " The American bowed . " My name is Paul Swift . I 'm pleased to meet you . " He was about twenty-five years old . Maybe thirty . Foreigners ' ages were difficult to judge . Toshi bowed again . " I 'm pleased to meet you . My name is Okamoto , but please call me Toshi . " " And you should call me Paul . " " I like foreigners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been offended by the TV announcer . " Is that so ? Well , I like the Japanese . We 're very lucky to have met then , are n't we ? " " Yes . I like Audrey Hepburn . Do you know her ? " Paul Swift rolled his eyes again . A dozen Indian women in blue saris swept into the station , a breeze on their backs . Toshi turned toward them , astonished at how quickly his life was changing . Paul took him to a small bar in Shinjuku where Japanese and English conversation floated through the air , mingled with the cigarette smoke , and made him dizzy . The master brought over hot towels and a plate of peanuts and dried squid . " I like this music , " Toshi said in English , not really hearing it but knowing he should say something . " Ella Fitzgerald . " " Yes . " Was that a kind of music ? " She 's a black American singer . "  | " Yes . I like American singers . " " Really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beers arrived . Paul sipped . Toshi gulped his . He 'd never been in a bar before . He 'd never talked to a foreigner . Everything was moving so fast . " So , what sport do you play ? " Paul asked . " Sport ? " " Judging from your shaved head , you 're either a Buddhist monk , which seems unlikely , or an ath-lete . " " I am a student , " he said , hoping it was the right answer . Paul smiled . " Which university ? " He felt himself blush . " I am in high school . " Paul slapped his forehead and spun around on his stool , said something in English Toshi did n't under-stand . " What ? " " Jailbait , " he repeated slowly . " Two syllables . " Toshi had gone to Roppongi that night looking for foreign women to draw . He had his sketch pad in his day pack . But there were only men in this bar . So he stared hard at Paul , memorizing his fea-tures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? imagining him in pencil and charcoal . Suddenly he realized that Paul was staring back at him . He  | looked away , embarrassed , and scrambled for something to say . " What is your job ? " Paul grinned and passed him his business card . Densu . The biggest advertising agency in Japan . Copywriter . " This is a very great company . You are a smart man , I think . " Paul grinned . " That 's true . " He thought of another question . " Are you married ? " " No . " " You have a girlfriend ? " " No , no girlfriend . " " You like Japanese girls ? " " I like Japanese boys . " Toshi laughed . Americans were funny . Paul looked at his watch . " It 's after midnight . The trains have stopped running . You 'll have to take a taxi back to your hotel , and they 're very hard to get at this hour . " " That 's all right . The hotel is nearby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . Very lucky . " " No , that 's not ... " " Yes ? " " That is , if you wanted to , you could stay at my apartment . It would be a new experience for you . A foreigner 's apartment . "  | " Really ? I could ? " He did n't understand why so many people were scared of foreigners . Paul was kind and generous . Toshi finished his fourth  --  or was it his fifth ? ? beer . " Yes , please . I 'm looking forward to it . " " So am I. It should be an interesting night . " Paul signaled for the bill , then took out his wallet . He was afraid to walk across the thick carpeting , to touch the white furniture . The chairs and the sofa were so big and soft that when he sat down he felt like he was being swallowed up . But there were surfaces he had to be careful of too . Glass and metal , table edges that could cut him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms . And he might lose himself in the apartment , he realized , already confused by the number and spaciousness of the rooms , and by their foreignness . Unfamiliar shapes and textures like new ideas . There were two bedrooms . " You live here alone ? " " Yes . " Paul turned on the stereo . Japanese music . Shamisen . He collected Asian art . Chinese scrolls and Japanese woodblock prints hung on the walls . Toshi recognized a Hokusai . " Is it real ? " " Yes . Real . " " Expensive ? " He had seen Hokusai only in books . " I suppose . " Paul poured him a glass of white wine . Here was something else : He 'd never held a wine-  | glass . It was shaped like a stemmed flower . He lifted it with two hands , as he would a sake cup , one hand cupping the base , and swallowed the wine all at once . " No , no , no . Wine , you sip . Like this . " Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toilet , there was a framed photograph of a Japanese man in a loincloth , his muscular body tensed , the red sun flag behind him . The grim expression on his face and the sword in his hand disturbed Toshi . " Who is he ? " " That 's Mishima . " " Who ? " " You do n't know Yukio Mishima ? The writer ? " Toshi shook his head . There was so much he did n't know , even about Japan , it seemed . He was tired and drunk , and he walked through a dream of colors : Paul 's red hair , his own blue-socked feet sinking into the gray carpeting . Paul 's bed was as big as the room he slept in with his father , the blanket the color of squid just pulled from the sea . Toshi took off his pants and slid between two cotton sheets . Had his parents ' heads ever rested on such soft pillows ? Paul 's arm slipped around his waist , and Toshi supposed , halfasleep already , that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I first saw you on the street , I  | thought you were so handsome , " Paul whispered . " And then you turned out to be so nice , and smart , too . " No one had ever complimented him like this before . He was in one of the American movies he and his mother often went to see . He sat on white sofas and sipped white wine . His own skin was white . Toshi saw himself laugh as Americans laugh : uninhibited , his head thrown back , a flash of even , white teeth . He fell asleep . When he was a boy , his parents once took him to Sapporo for the Snow Festival , and they ate breakfast at Denny 's , an American restaurant : fried eggs with strips of bacon , a tomato salad with mayonnaise , corn soup , and a scoop of fried rice with a tiny American flag planted in the top . So the breakfast Paul served disappointed him . Bananas and strawberries and orange juice in the blender . French toast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American . The maple syrup , though , was thick and sweet , the way he imagined all American food to be . Paul told him it came from trees , and Toshi laughed at this . He wanted to fill up a glass and drink it . Then Paul said , " I like men . " Toshi nodded and reached for the syrup again . " Do you know what I mean ? " He shook his head , confused . " I 'm attracted to men , not women , " Paul said . Toshi  | stared down at his plate and pushed the last piece of toast around in the syrup . What was Paul telling him ? It was probably just another one of those foreigner things . He wanted more French toast . Then Paul said , " I 'm gay . " Startled , Toshi looked up . He knew gay . It was the same word in English and Japanese . Paul was staring at him , and it made him uncomfortable . " I brought you home expecting to have sex with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . We just went to sleep . " Sex with Paul . He could n't imagine it . Toshi had never had sex , but he knew who he wanted to have sex with . A foreign woman . Audrey Hepburn . Certainly not with Paul . It was such an absurd idea that he almost smiled . But he stopped himself . " Please forgive me . I still think you 're handsome and smart and nice , and I 'd like to be your friend . " He did n't answer . He did n't know what to say . Paul 's words , and the bitter coffee , and the sweet maple syrup made his head hot . In his hotel bathroom , there were illustrated instructions above the Western-style toilet : A stick-figure man squatted on top of the toilet seat  --  with a big red X through it . Below , another man used the toilet correctly , sitting on the seat as if it were a chair . But there were no stick figures in Paul 's bathroom . He was n't sure  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tub and soak , then leave it filled for Paul ? Or wash in the tub as Americans did ? If he did that , how would he get clean ? Paul 's confession had made him uneasy , and unsure of himself . He wished that there were instructions for dealing with foreigners . He looked at himself in the mirror . Paul had told him he was handsome , and those women had stared at him on the subway . But Toshi saw only his Japanese face and his hairless chest . At least his teeth were white and straight like an American 's . His skin was too dark , though . And his black hair stood up in spikes when it was wet . He unwrapped his thick bath towel and looked down . His legs were as smooth as a girl 's . He sighed . When he was twelve years old , Toshi had met a foreigner at the inn in Utoro , and had seen the face and body he wanted to grow into . He memorized it . He drank milk , played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club , willing a transformation of pigment , of features , and of size . Every morning he woke up and looked in the mirror . But now he was almost a man . He had grown up and nothing had changed .  | HIS FIRST GLIMPSE OF A FOREIGNER DISTURBED HIM . A white rental car heading down the mountainside like a fleeting , troubled dream . Crossing Shiretoko Peninsula on a Saturday afternoon , Toshi sat behind the bus driver and gazed out at the soggy spring landscape through a haze of cigarette smoke . The bus pulled into the parking lot at the top of the ridge . " Toshi-chan , look ! Foreigners ! " A white rental car swung out of the lot and disappeared around a curve . " Did you see them ? " the bus driver , Mr. Goto , asked . " Yes , I saw them , " he lied , confused first by desire , then by shame . " Scary-looking , were n't they ? " He opened the bus door . Two bird-watchers stepped down to the asphalt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bus was on the road again , heading down the mountain , Toshi 's face pressed against the window , his breath on the glass , visible , invisible , then visible again . Impatient , he could al-  | ready see Utoro , a patch of gray scooped out of the coastline . The rental car was parked in front of the inn , its tires splashed with mud . He ran up the stairs and stepped out of his shoes . His mother and Granny were in the kitchen , bent over a wooden tub of rice . Granny laughed at his agitation . " Oh , the foreigners . Yes , they 're staying here . They just went off on a sightseeing boat . " Three Australians , a man and two women . Granny had spoken to them . " The man spoke very nice Japanese . I was sur-prised . " " Do you know where Australia is ? " his mother asked . She fanned the rice with a magazine while Granny poured on the vinegar . " Near America ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having sushi ? " " It 's a special day . It 's Granny 's seventieth birthday . " " Is it really your birthday ? " " Yes . I 'm getting so old . And can you believe it , I have to make my own dinner . " " I can help , and you can go rest . " " No , no , " she laughed again . " I enjoy cooking . " " But what will the foreigners eat ? They ca n't eat raw fish . " " Oh dear , that 's right , " his mother said .  | " Well , they told me they could eat anything at all , and that 's what they 're getting . " " In any case , we 'd better give them forks and knives , " his mother said . She put down the magazine and started opening drawers . " Did I ever tell you ? I once delivered a foreign baby in Yokohama , " Granny said . " About 1950 , it was . I 'll never forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful baby I 'd ever seen . " Granny made a cradle of her arms and rocked it , remembering . Toshi saw a perfect , pink-skinned , blueeyed , smiling baby . Taro said it made no difference to him , Japanese or foreigner , they were all the same , what was the fuss about ? And he went off fishing . Toshi stayed behind to help his mother . " I hope they understand that we do n't have beds for them , " she said as they vacuumed the tatami , then carried the mattresses and quilts up to the roof to air . " Maybe we should give them two mattresses each , so they 'll be more comfortable . Of course , it will still seem primitive to them , wo n't it ? " It was the first time he ever heard her talk like this . Was the way they lived really so bad ? " And what shall we do about the bath ? " " What 's wrong with the bath ? " The inn had a nice bath . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the bathtub , not outside . And they refill the tub for each person . " " You 're joking , are n't you ? " " No , it 's true . Granny will have to explain to them . " She lifted the last load of quilts , then stopped in the doorway and looked around the room , as if searching for something . " I asked Taro to pick up meat and eggs , so we can make them a Western breakfast . Have we forgotten anything ? " The presence of foreigners at the inn had disturbed Toshi ' s mother . He watched anxiously as her face darkened . She turned and stepped off the tatami and into her slippers . From the back , she was twice divided by white apron strings , at the neck and at the waist . " So many Australians were killed in the war . Terri-ble , " she said . He knew she was talking to herself . " It 's okay , Mother . The war was a long time ago , was n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he 'd said . " A long time ago . The war was a long time ago . " She was already drifting away . He wanted to grasp her apron strings and pull her back . But he stayed put . She sighed , and left the room . He listened to her slippers on the wood floor , then her slow , steady footfalls on the metal staircase to the roof . Alone in the room , Toshi felt the shift in both mood and light . Outside , he knew without looking , the village of Utoro , the sea itself , had somehow altered . He could  | make no sense of what his mother had said , so , instead , he considered this : In Roman Holiday , Audrey Hepburn took a bath in Gregory Peck 's apartment . If what she said was true , then Audrey Hepburn sat in her own dirty bathwater . Toshi lathered the rough washcloth , dipped it in the plastic bucket , and scrubbed his body hard . Sitting on a low stool , he shampooed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured it over his head again and again . When he 'd rinsed all the soap from his body , he stood up and walked across the bathroom . Cold air and afternoon sunlight poured in the open window and illuminated the gleaming stainless steel tub . He edged in , his ankles , then his shins . The ache entered his skin , seeped into his muscles and bones . His body absorbed the heat all the way up to his neck . Outside , the five o'clock siren sounded . When he stood up , his dark skin was too tender to touch . He crossed the room and squatted in front of the mirror , watched the steam rise from his skin . He poured a bucket of cold water over his head , then pursed his wet lips , unsure of his own reflection . The glass door slid open , and banged against its metal frame . In the mirror , he saw long , hairy legs and the hem of the inn 's blue and white robe . " Is it all right to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in the doorway , obscured by shadow and steam , the dressing room 's fluo-  | rescent light and green tile walls behind him . He was as tall as a tree . Toshi was too astonished to reply . " Hello . Is it all right to use the bath ? " Light shone through his pink ears and shock of blond hair . The wall fan rotated and disturbed the cotton sleeves of his robe . Toshi realized his rudeness and stood up . " Yes . Please come in . " Bowing , he saw fragments of his own body  --  his knees , a shoulder , his penis  --  scattered on the wet tile like pieces of a puzzle . He kept his head down as the foreigner untied the sash of his robe , folded up the blue and white material , and stepped into the bathroom . A shrinking rectangle of sunlight traveled up past Toshi 's head and glowed on the wall like a movie screen . Water dripped from a faucet into a yellow plastic bucket , each drop startling him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . Toshi could n't stop himself ; he reached out and ran his fingers up the man 's thick arm to the elbow , turning the dense blond hair over like autumn grass . The Australian laughed and stepped closer . Toshi jerked his hand away , ashamed of what he 'd done , then gasped when he saw the foreigner 's penis ? absurdly long , and thick as a matsutake mushroom . Dizzy , he looked down at his own hairless , translucent body . The landscape transformed . He crossed his hands over his tiny genitals . " What 's your name ? " the Australian asked . Toshi darted past him , tumbled out the door , and  | slammed it shut . He stood under the fluorescent light , shaking , swallowing air like a landed fish . And when he caught his own reflection in the minor , he swooned . For he had become insubstantial , a phantasm of steam . " I have a stomachache , " he told his mother . She was surprised to find him under the quilt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wo n't meet the foreigners if you do n't come eat . " " I ca n't eat . " He would n't tell her about the bath . She 'd say he 'd been rude . " Granny will be disappointed . " She bent down and felt his forehead . " You do n't have a fever . " " Really , I 'm sick . I 'll make Granny a drawing for her birthday tomorrow . " " That would be nice . " She looked at him , uncertain , then closed the door behind her . Light from the street lamp hit the frosted window and broke into thousands of pieces . Voices drifted out of the second-floor dining room , carried on the steady current of Taro 's constant laughter . Alone in the dark , Toshi listened to the English words that flitted in and out of the dinner conversation like hummingbirds . The language of movies , of Audrey Hepburn , it hovered outside his door . He was hungry and miserable , ashamed of himself . He felt the heavy quilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared into the mattress . Hummingbird wings beat furiously in his chest , and they stirred up a scene he would carry with him into the future : The foreigner washes himself inside the bathtub , shampoos his blond hair , and turns the water dirty . Toshi , standing by the tub , draws his picture . The foreigner is impressed . Toshi 's own arms and hands are thick and muscular . Using brilliantly colored crayons , he sketches faster , draws marvelous pictures of things he 's never even seen : Palm trees . A koala bear . The Imperial Palace . He draws Audrey Hepburn . The foreigner applauds . Then Toshi explains to him in grammatically perfect English how to take a Japanese bath  --  how to wash and rinse before stepping into the tub . Apologetic and grateful , the foreigner stands up , naked . But Toshi does n't run away . No , he looks right at him , and he holds the drawings out to him . " A gift , " he says . The foreigner replies in the kindest voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why do n't you come back to Australia with me ? You 're much too smart and handsome to stay here in Japan . Yes , Toshi , you can be a foreigner like me. "  | THE DOORBELL INTERRUPTS A DREAM OF HIS CHILDhood : Falling snow . A white car stops in front of the noodle shop . Audrey Hepburn steps out , her legs bare . Toshi blinks himself awake and shuffles to the front door . It 's eight in the morning . A long-faced mailman in a motorcycle helmet holds out a clipboard . Toshi stamps his seal on a document , and the mailman hands him an express , registered letter . A square rice paper envelope tinted a delicate red . Jane 's name , unexpected , embossed on the back in phonetic Japanese , startles him . He leaves the unopened envelope on the kotatsu , lights the burner , and puts water on for tea . He sits down and stares at the envelope , then out the sliding glass doors . He gets up and waters the plants on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad feeling about the letter and does n't want to open it . He 's learned from past American girlfriends that when they have something nice to say , they simply say it . But when they have something unpleasant to tell him , they like to write it down .  | Toshi lives in a six-tatami-mat room with no bath , on the tenth floor of a rickety old building that sways alarmingly in typhoons and earthquakes . He looks out his balcony doors at an old washing machine left by the previous tenant , and on three potted azaleas given to him by Wanda Williford . When the apartment building went up almost forty years ago , it was the first in the neighborhood . There 's an old framed photograph in the lobby taken from this , the top , floor : a patterned landscape of dark tile roofs , rice paddies , and vegetable gardens , wood smoke rising out of bathhouse chimneys . But today 's view : across the street , another dreary , concrete apartment building , then another , and another , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finally , opens the letter . It is handwritten and long . After only one date , how could she possibly have so much to say to him ? Dear Toshi , It 's been more than twenty-four hours and I have n't heard from you . Maybe you did call . Sometimes I forget to leave my answering machine on . When I 'm feeling confused , like I am right now . There are things I want to say to you , need to say , about the other night . About my life . When I was a girl , I had long , stringy hair . I was n't pretty . No , she was n't pretty or nice . Other girls teased her . He puts the letter down . He 's not sure he wants to read the rest . Did he do something wrong the other p 65 night ? Say the wrong thing ? His girlfriends always want something from him , only they never tell him what it is . They expect him just to know . Dressing , he examines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks that adorn his flesh like tattoos . He 'd been wrong about Jane . She 's so funny in class , so energetic , so American . He 'd imagined that sex with her would be exciting . But it was n't exciting , it was scary . He had no control . On her futon they traveled forward , fast , but only she knew where they were going and how to get there . Before he leaves for the studio , he reads the rest of the letter . The first time you walked into my classroom , I felt the incredible sexual current that flows between us . You felt it , also , I know . I got wet just looking at you , at your beautiful legs . This is what I want : To get down on my knees , right there in front of the class , and lick your calves and your thighs , to stick my tongue up the leg of your shorts . I know why you wear those shorts . Toshi ca n't believe this letter . But as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeans . I had no idea it would be like it was . After making love with you  --  how many times was it ? Four ? Five ? Six times ? ? I 'm stunned , dazed . Exhausted . I can barely speak or eat .  | She peels an orange , and she sucks out the juice . In Florida , where her father lives , the oranges are incredibly sweet . The white flesh of the orange is under her fingernails as she writes this letter . Can you smell it ? The juice runs down her chin , her throat , between her breasts . She presses her breasts to the paper . Her body is sore from you , but still it craves you . She thinks only of this . Your skin . To touch it . And now look : Her head , her hair is on fire . Toshi closes his eyes . Shinjuku Station . On platform twelve , trains arrive and depart every forty-three seconds . " Move quickly ! Do n't fall off the platform ! Work hard today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herded along by a battalion of whitegloved men , shoved through the doors of cars already filled to twice their capacity . The doors shut behind him , and Toshi turns to look out the window . On the platform , stooped Korean women wearing surgical masks sweep up shoes , briefcases , umbrellas , and magazines , drop them into bins marked LOST AND FOUND . Inside the car , everyone watches the morning news on the TV monitors over every door : The Minister of Agriculture 's suicide . The burning rice fields in Niigata Prefecture . The schoolboy next to Toshi falls asleep standing up , his head resting on Toshi 's shoulder , saliva seeping from the corner of his mouth . At Yoyogi Station , a pretty , dark-haired foreigner is shoved through  | the door , wedged in two bodies over from Toshi , who shifts slightly so that he faces her . Her hair , piled on top of her head , trembles in the slight whoosh of air from the ceiling fan . He waits for her to look his way so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they hold their comic books and newspapers up to their faces , form a circle around her , and press in . She closes her eyes , lets out the tiniest cry of pain , like a little bird , and then sinks out of sight . WHILE EVERYONE ELSE HE KNOWS TAKES SNAPSHOTS , Toshi does n't even own a camera . He prefers to sketch the places he visits and the people he meets . Soon after he started to work at Nakamura Studio as a manga illustrator , he sent envelopes of sketches to both his mother and his father : the five-story , stucco Tokyo Refresh Building , which houses , on the ground floor , the Paris Esthetic Salon , with its facade of marble columns and nude statues ; and , on the second floor , the Fly Sexy Snack Bar and Karaoke Lounge , where his boss , Nakamura , took him for drinks after his first day of work . The hostesses wore topless stewardess uniforms and served them their beers on airline trays . On the third floor , " Nakamura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and , just inside , the coatrack and the crowded umbrella stand . He drew in blue , green , and pink plastic umbrellas . The " Hello Kitty " umbrella , the American-flag umbrella , and the Tokyo Giants umbrella . Now , almost a year after making those drawings , the same umbrellas are still there . And the room has hardly been cleaned in all that time either . Cigarette smoke long ago stained the walls and ceiling yellow . Faded posters of Nakamura 's most famous manga character , Chocolate Girl , in her various incarnations  --  uniformed office lady , high-priced prostitute , super-heroine in black leather boots and helmet ? are peeling off the walls , so that she seems drunk , or dead , her arms and legs akimbo . Fifty pages of Chocolate Girl 's serialized adventures appear weekly in Business Hip Hop , a best-selling comic book , and have turned her creator , Tetsuya Nakamura , into an unlikely media celebrity . Every time Toshi turns on the TV , there 's his boss  --  his eyeglasses smudged , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview shows and quiz shows , in cameo roles on detective dramas . Once he was cast as a murder victim , and Toshi watched his boss plummet from the roof of Takashimaya department store . Nakamura Studio also produces other comics , but Chocolate Girl , who stands tall and big busted behind Nakamura 's desk in a life-size cardboard cutout , pays the rent and the salaries of Toshi and his two coworkers . Each week , Nakamura draws a rough sto-  | ryboard and writes the dialogue , then Toshi , Akira , and Mami finish the drawings . Mangas are as popular as newspapers , and Chocolate Girl 's battles with rapists , child molesters , gangsters , and rice smugglers are followed by most of Japan . And Toshi likes his boss . Nakamura is an odd and funny man . When Toshi comes to work , he never knows what to expect . Today he walks in to find a big sheepdog trotting in circles in the middle of the room , kicking up dust . Mami follows it around , trying to pet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Look , Toshi-chan . A dog . Come touch it , " Mami says . " Go ahead . Do n't be shy . Try it , " Nakamura says . " Whose dog is it ? Akira-kun ? " Akira is , as always , staring at his computer screen , his gold earrings and dyed blond hair hidden inside his sweatshirt hood . The beeps and groans of a computer game fill the room . " Me ? How could I have a pet ? I live in a four-mat room . " " It 's ours , for one hour , " Nakamura says . " I rented it . We have a year 's contract . One hour , once a week . " " Rented it ? You 're joking ? " " Is n't it wonderful ! " Mami kneels down , adjusting her white leather miniskirt , and squeezes the dog around its waist , but the dog squirms out of her grasp . " I feel so lighthearted . " " You 'd better hurry up and pet it . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick it up , " Nakamura says .  | The dog sits down and barks . Mami backs away . " Do n't worry . That was a happy bark , " Akira says without looking up . " How do you know ? " Mami asks . " I understand dogs . I have a way with animals , " he says . On his screen , two Japanese farmers poke pitchforks into a sack of rice with an American flag on it . Each time a pitchfork scores a hit , grains of rice fill up the screen , and the farmers ' hats fly off their heads . " If this dog causes us any trouble , next week we 'll get a different one , " Nakamura says . " You actually rented a dog ? " Toshi asks . Mami tentatively approaches the dog again . " That 's right . With so many people dying from overwork , I thought we should do our part to stay healthy . Having a pet around the office helps you to relax . It improves office efficiency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Tokyo has the time or space to care for a dog . So this friend of mine started a pet rental company . It 's become very popular . He 's getting rich . " " I do feel so much happier , " Mami says , but just as she leans down to hug the dog again , a strong jolt shakes the room . Pencils and ashtrays rise into the air , then fall back onto the desks with a clatter . The coatrack tips into Toshi 's arms . The dog growls and lunges at Mami . She screams and runs behind Toshi . " Would n't you know it , a dog scared of earth-  | quakes . " Nakamura backs toward the door , puffing hard on his cigarette . Akira jumps up and holds his chair in front of him like a lion tamer . " Everybody get back . Take it easy , dog . Relax . What 's this dog 's name ? " " I do n't know . Look on the rental receipt . " " You call the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Akira says . " The police ? Why ? The dog does n't look dangerous , only confused . This room is too small for a big dog . " He feels sorry for the dog . How many offices does he visit every day ? How many strangers pet him ? " They can bring a tranquilizer gun or something , " Akira says . " Oh , look ! " Mami says . The dog lays down , puts its big round head on its paws , and closes its eyes . Nakamura lights another cigarette and sticks it in his mouth next to the first one . They all watch silently as the dog starts to snore . Its tail twitches , swatting the dusty floor . " How sweet , " says Mami . " It 's dreaming . " TWO GIGANTIC TELEVISION SCREENS FLOOD THE PLAZA in front of Shibuya Station with bright , High Definition 273 images : An army of armored samurai ride their horses over a cliff and , banners waving , plummet into the sea . Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Toshi is swept through the ticket wicket and out of the station on a wave of spring colors and flower-patterned umbrellas . The crowd splits before a Caucasian street musician strumming a guitar , then comes together again like seawater swirling around a reef . Toshi breaks free , finds himself in front of a girl who holds out a clipboard and a pen to him . " Free cigarettes and a doughnut if you sign , " she says in stilted Japanese . She 's dark-skinned . Possibly Thai . He glances at the petition . Something about Cambodia and the U.N . Peace-Keeping Force . " I 'm sorry , but I do n't have time . I 'm late . " He signs without reading it and takes his doughnut . " Peace , " the girl says , holding up a pack of cigarettes of the same name . " No , thank you . " Swallowing his doughnut , he threads his way through the procession of shoppers heading up Dogenzaka Hill , past window displays of Italian furniture , digital rice cookers , Burberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he arrives at the Very Romantic English Academy , classes have already started , and the hallways are deserted . What he really wants to do is leave right now ,  | go back to the studio . Passing each closed classroom door , he hears snatches of CNN news broadcasts , language tapes , and conversation drills : " Take my wallet . Take my wristwatch . Take my leather coat , please . Please do n't shoot . " Pausing outside Jane 's classroom , he hears nothing . He takes a deep breath and opens the door . The room is empty , and there is a note on the blackboard : " To-day 's five o'clock class is canceled . " Instead of relief , he feels uneasy . Jane has never canceled class before . He 's sure it has something to do with him . Did the school find out about them ? There 's a pay phone in the lobby . He takes a " Malcolm X " phone card from his wallet , inserts it , and Denzel Washington 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He punches in Jane 's number . After the third ring , she answers in a sleepy voice . " Hello . This is Toshi calling , " he says in English . " Oh , " she says . Then , " I was hoping you 'd call . " " Yes . " What should he say to her ? " I 've been waiting for you . " " Are you sick ? " " Am I sick ? " " Our class is canceled , it says on the blackboard . " He 's sweating . Why is he explaining this to her ? Does n't she know ? " Please come over . Right away . I need to see you , " she whispers , then hangs up before he can reply . Nine  | units left . He replaces the receiver . Denzel Washington pops out into his hand . Opening a box of Domino 's pizza , Jane kneels by the table and points out the toppings one by one , as if giving Toshi a pronunciation lesson : " Grilled eel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her finger through a curl of mayonnaise and brings it to his lips . He is n't sure what to do ; her finger waits poised outside his mouth . He sticks out his tongue and licks it . She giggles , then puts her finger in her own mouth , pulls it out with a popping sound . She turns on the TV while they eat . A man carries a cat up a flight of stairs . The cat curls up into a ball and rolls down the stairs . The man carries the cat up the stairs again . " I could n't teach today . I was afraid you might be in class and I knew I would n't be able to look at you in front of the other students . Especially those awful Ishikawa sisters . " " Why ? " " God , Toshi , do n't you know ? " " No , " he says , telling the truth . He did n't want to come , and now he wishes he was n't here . He 's made a mistake with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken fingernail . Light hair growing on her arms . Specks of food and dust balls on the kitchen floor . Toshi is allergic to dust , and his nose is stuffed up .  | On the night of his birthday dinner , Jane had said as she opened her front door , " I have to warn you , I never clean . " She said this with a finality that suggested a disability , or doctor 's orders . His friend Paul often did learn to program his video recorder  --  as if laziness or ineptitude was something to boast about . " Toshi , look at me . " He does , reluctantly , and he sneezes . " God bless you , " she says , pushing up the sleeves of her red dress , as if she is getting ready for a fight . Except for shrimp-shaped silver earrings , she is n't wearing any jewelry . Or makeup . She looks tired . " Are we going to argue ? " he asks . " Everybody argues . It 's normal . Confrontation can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confrontation means , but he nods . " I was n't a virgin before the other night . " She giggles again , and for just a moment she looks girlish and vulnerable . But then she shakes her head vigorously , as if to dismiss that part of herself . " You ca n't fool me . I 'm not wrong about what happened between us . " " What happened ? " he asks , wishing she would tell him what she wants . He could stop on the way home for a long bath , then pick up a movie at the video store . Audrey Hepburn sitting on the veranda of a ski resort . Instead of answering him , she stands abruptly and  | whirls around the tiny room . " Once a man loved me so much he wanted to kill me . I thought he would strangle me , or set me on fire . " She stops and stares at him , staggering slightly . Could she be drunk already , on only one glass of wine ? She was drinking before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the windows ? " There are metal bars he had n't noticed before . Seeing them , he feels trapped . She drops to her knees and reaches for her cigarettes . " I had them put on . I was afraid for my life . But when he came to my door , I always let him in . " " Why ? " Is she making up this story ? He does n't believe anything she says anymore . " He was so beautiful . He was the most beautiful Japanese man I 've ever seen . " She shivers . " I ached when I looked at him . I could n't refuse him . " She lights a cigarette , takes a deep drag , then immediately grinds it out on the lid of the pizza box . As smoke trickles from the corners of her mouth , she plucks a piece of eel off the pizza and eats it . He sneezes again . She hands him a box of tissues . " You know that feeling , do n't you ? The night of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stop thinking about it , it 's like I 'm going crazy . " He does n't know what to say . He wishes she would sit still . She keeps moving , changing direction and subjects . All of the pictures on her walls  --  not just the woodblock prints , but the photographs and postcards ?  | are of naked men and women . Over her desk , there 's a drawing of a man with a penis so big he holds it up with both hands , the head fanning out over him like an umbrella . What kind of woman would have a picture like that on her wall for everybody to see ? " You felt it too , I know you did . It could n't have been just me . " " Yes . I felt it . " Felt what ? His nipples still chafe under his clothes . He 's chafing too , in her small apartment - the dust and cigarette smoke , and she has so many things , too many things . There are piles of clothes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boxes filled with letters , he imagines . Letters to men . Years of letters  --  although he realizes that this is illogical . If she 'd sent the letters , they would n't be here . But then , Jane is n't logical . And Jane might make copies . She is someone who would copy every letter she writes . " Do n't lie to me , " she cries suddenly . " You think I 'm awful , do n't you ? I am , I 'm dreadful , and I 'm not pretty . You should leave now , just go home . " " No . You 're pretty , " he says as she starts to sob . " Do you mean that ? You 're not just saying it ? " " Yes . Yes , I do , " he says , feeling himself being drawn in against his will . " Oh God , I 'm sorry . I 'm so , so sorry . " She is on top of him so fast he falls over backward , a slice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she wraps her arms tightly around him , and he feels the pizza soak through his shirt .  | " Do n't go away . Please , I do n't know what I 'd do . Just tonight , please stay , only for tonight , I swear . " She kisses him , her tongue pushing through his teeth . He tastes eel and pineapple . She fumbles with his zipper . Aroused , he gives in . He pulls up her dress and slips his hand under the waistband of her tights . " Oh , Toshi , oh , God . " His fingertips graze her bare skin , and he feels her rising heat . Light from the TV flickers faster and faster on the insides of his eyelids until a moving image comes into focus . Audrey Hepburn dances around the rim of a magnificent fountain in Rome . Her tongue fills his mouth . His nose is blocked . He gasps for air . THE ACUPUNCTURIST 'S CLINIC WAS ABOVE A FURNITURE store just off Shari 's main street . Toshi ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocking feet resting on an electric foot massager . Toshi could hear the thump thump of the motorized machine from inside the treatment room as he took off his clothes and folded them in a plastic basket at the foot of the treatment table . The acupuncturist covered him with a white  | sheet . Someone was snoring on the other side of the curtain . " Another patient , " she said in a soothing voice . Mrs. Suzuki was a plump , middle-aged woman in a white smock . A month after his mother left them for the inn in Utoro , Toshi woke up in the middle of the night , startled to find himself sitting upright in the dark room , gasping for breath . Outside the window , snow fell steadily , and he imagined it piling up in his chest . " Close your eyes now . The needles may hurt a bit , but it 's a good pain , " she said . " A boy as handsome as you surely must be brave , too , is n't that so ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders , in his arms and legs , in the crooks of his hands between his thumbs and fingers . They slid in easily , each one striking a forgotten fear : His mother leaps into the heaving winter sea . She will disappear in a snowstorm . She jiggled the needles in his forehead , and a liquid heat sprang from his hips and rushed to the tips of his feet . A memory welled up : Toshi wakes up in the middle of the night to see his father kneeling next to his mother 's mattress . " Please , " his father whispers . " I ca n't . Forgive me . " His mother rolls away , her back to him . Toshi cried out in the dark , then opened his eyes . Mrs. Suzuki was leaning over him . " Are you all right ? I did n't hurt you , did I ? " " Yes , I 'm all right . I 'm sorry , " he said , ashamed that  | somehow she knew what he 'd seen . What had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She burned moxa on either side of the bridge of his nose , and he felt the heat on his eyelids . Could she burn his eyes and blind him ? Did his father know she was lighting fires on his face ? When she lit moxa on the crown of his head he felt a sharp , quick burn , like when he touched the metal handle of the ramen broth pot , and inside his narrow chest , thin spring ice cracked over a rushing stream . Clear water gushed out , and the vision of his parents disappeared . Toshi could breathe again . Afterward , in the waiting room , the acupuncturist said to his father , " He may be allergic to dust . Please tell his mother that she should keep his room very clean . " " I see , " his father said . Toshi was afraid he would tell her about his mother , and about how they were alone now . It was Toshi who vacuumed and dusted the rooms . His father did the laundry . " Can you bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four more treatments . " " Hmmm " is all he said . " Just look at his face . He has much more color already . He looked so tired when he came in . Such a handsome boy should n't look tired . " His father stared at him , as if for the first time . Toshi blushed .  | They left the coast road and drove across the peninsula inside a plowed white tunnel of snow , a strip of brilliant blue sky over their heads . His father lit a cigarette . " Did it hurt ? " " A little . " Toshi could n't look at his father 's face . The memory her needle had inflamed had faded , but the place where the memory had been was tender as a wound . " Do you think it helped ? " " She said it would take time . " Then they were quiet until they drove up to the end of the road and parked the car next to the noodle shop . The heavy winter sea groaned . " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " his father said . That evening , he called his mother . Her voice sounded tired . " Mother , are you well ? " " To tell the truth , I have n't been sleeping . But I 'm okay . And what about you ? Are you and your father fine ? " He told her about his allergy and the visit to the acupuncturist . " Do you think I should go back to see her again ? " he asked . " Father said I should ask you . " She was silent . " Mother ? " He could hear her labored breathing . " Forgive me , " she said . And the memory welled up again .  | The first time I wanted to make love to a Japanese man was when I was fifteen years old and I saw Toshiro Mifune in Rashomon . Two days later , Jane 's second letter arrives , by ordinary mail , in a red-tinted rice paper envelope . She must have written and sent it right after he left her apartment , he realizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving restlessly across the soft paper . He had the most beautiful thighs . Thick , sweaty thighs . I used to masturbate imagining Toshiro Mifune naked , lying on top of me , raping me instead of that silly woman in the film , his smooth thighs shiny with sweat . He calls his friend Paul . " Why did you wait so long to tell me ? " " I do n't know . " " Meet me for dinner tonight , " Paul says . " I 'm too tired . "  | " Of course you are after so much sex . It 's a wonder you 're alive . But I 'll pay . " " Are you sure ? " " I live to get you out of woman trouble . Come on , I ca n't wait to hear all the gory details . We 'll go someplace nice , and I 'll give you lots of sympathy . " " Okay . " " Meet me at Harajuku Station at six . We 'll take a walk in the park before dinner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time they met , Toshi returned to Rausu and wrote Paul a letter . Paul 's being gay puzzled him more than it concerned him . And he admired Paul . " I would like to be your good friend , " he wrote in careful English . Paul replied by express mail . " I would like to be your good friend too . " Toshi still has that letter . They corresponded regularly in English and in Japanese , by letter and postcard and , occasionally , by phone . Toshi drew pictures and sent them to Paul , explanations and questions printed neatly on the back . " My mother shoveling snow . " " My father watching TV . " " Granny sweeping the street . " " This is my father 's noodle shop . Do you like noodles ? " Once he drew two grinning fishermen holding up an octopus . To his delight , Paul replied in kind  --  not with sketches , but with snapshots that made Toshi laugh . " My foot . " " My other foot . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The crowded train I take to work every morning " showed only the tops of heads lit up by a camera flash .  | Toshi ended up going to college in Sapporo . Paul came to visit twice , both times in the winter , and took Toshi skiing . Toshi ' s college friends were surprised to see him with a foreigner , and they began to treat him with a mixture of caution and respect . Toshi studied English . Before spring vacation his third year , Paul sent him a round-trip plane ticket to Tokyo , along with a note : " Do n't worry . You can sleep in the extra bedroom . " After he graduated , he lived with Paul until he found a job and his own apartment . Paul is his best friend , and the Tokyo Toshi knows is the one Paul introduced him to , the Tokyo of expatriates : Mexican and Italian restaurants . Luxurious apartments he could never afford to live in . Western-style supermarkets that stock their shelves with expensive products he 's never heard of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ olives and cheeses from France . Bars , gay and straight , that cater to Westerners and Japanese who are looking for one another . In this world , Toshi was pleased to discover , Paul 's sexuality was not a problem . His friends and acquaintances knew but did n't care . By then , Toshi did n't care either . The Tokyo Paul introduced him to keeps changing , though , faster than they can walk through it . Just a year ago , construction cranes crowded the skyline . Familiar buildings disappeared overnight and were replaced at a startling speed . But recently , the recession has been transforming the landscape : On the grassy lawns of Yoyogi Park , a tent city has blossomed . Dark-skinned foreign men gather around cooking fires and drink steaming cups of tea .  | " Poor guys . They 're just waiting to be caught and deported . I 'll bet none of them have visas , " Paul says . " Or jobs , now that the construction industry 's gone belly up . " " Belly up ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh . " Collapse . Fall down . Buildings collapse . So do people . So , apparently , do industries . He watches the foreigners pass food from hand to hand , hand to mouth , their swarthy faces illuminated by the flames , their backs turned to the quickening darkness . Toshi smells strong spices . " Toshiro Mifune 's thighs ? Well , that 's not an unusual reason for coming to japan . Although I do n't see the resemblance . I always thought your legs were too thin . " " It 's not a joke . " " It was n't supposed to be . " Paul stops walking . " Look , I 'm sorry you got yourself into trouble . But there 's something you need to understand about people . We do n't always do things for good , smart , logical reasons . " " What do you mean ? " " I mean I ended up in Japan because I saw a picture of Yukio Mishima in a book when I was sixteen . I read his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ karate . I learned Japanese from cassette tapes . My mother said my eyes were going to slant if I did n't stop . I went to college and majored in Japanese . Then I came here for my junior year . " " I already know that . You already told me that . "  | A man steps out from behind a tree , blocking their path and startling Toshi . But when he opens his outstretched hand , it is filled with rice . " Jasmine . From Thailand , " he whispers . " No , thank you , " Paul says politely . He grips Toshi 's elbow and turns him toward the park exit . The cherry trees are almost in full flower , and their petals gather up what 's left of the fading light . " Look , there are lots of things that interest me about Japan . But let 's be honest . What got me here ? I mean , what was the pivotal event , the thing that changed the direction of my entire life , that carried me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A photograph of Yukio Mishima in a loincloth . That 's what . " He stops , still holding Toshi 's elbow , and looks him in the eyes . " And why am I still here ? Why am I here in Japan , in Tokyo ? " " I do n't know , " Toshi says , thinking that he really does know the answer . " Yes , you do . " " No . " He does n't want to say it . But Paul does . " I 'm here for the men . " " That 's stupid , " Toshi says . He pulls his arm free and forces out a laugh . He does n't like to hear these things from Paul . " That 's a stupid reason . You should n't say that . You 're too smart . " " No . I 'm not . When it comes to love and sex , nobody p 87 is smart . That 's what you have n't learned yet . " He pauses . " Particularly about yourself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always telling him things about himself that he does n't want to hear . Is this what friends do in America ? Criticize each other ? Point out each other 's weaknesses ? For what reason ? Widened and planted with trees for the 1964 Olympics , Omotesando Street is Tokyo 's most fashionable boulevard . Toshi is surprised to see how it 's changed . Cafe HaagenDazs and Cafe Rope have closed their doors . And the sidewalks are lined with foreigners selling wares spread out on blankets . Jewelry . Pottery . Framed oil seascapes , and sand paintings . " Terrible , " he says . " Well . More like inevitable , " Paul says . " What goes up must come down . " Up , down . In , out . In high school English class , Toshi had to memorize lists of opposites . Cold , hot . Light , dark . Happy , sad . Safe , dangerous . " Will you help me with Jane ? " " You should learn to handle these things yourself . " " Please . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'll eat you alive . " Toshi felt for Jane 's teeth marks , hidden by his shirt . He could n't show them to Paul . Could she really eat him ? " Please . You always know what to do . " " I suppose we can write her a letter . That way you can  | say what you want without having to see her and endanger your poor , overworked penis . We 'll write it during dinner . " They stroll past SALE signs plastered in the windows of Kiddy Land , Vivre 21 Fashion Building , and Shu Uemura . The Hanae Mori Building is dark . Outside on the plaza , where Toshi once sat on a Sunday afternoon and drank iced tea with Wanda Williford , a flea market has sprung up . Young Japanese women selling their Louis Vuitton bags and Hermes scarves . Men , their Rolex watches , Italian neckties , and leather briefcases . " I 'm starving . Korean barbecue , Indian , or Thai ? " " Thai . " A Mercedes-Benz is parked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A woman in black leather has spread a blanket on the hood , and on top of it , a crystal ball and a deck of tarot cards . She hands Toshi a business card as he walks by . LEARN YOUR FUTURE . BUSINESS MAI IERS . ROMANCE . " Maybe we should try her . " He hands the card to Paul . " She 's selling her car . How good can she be ? " " Not for business . For romance . " Paul drops the card into a trash can . " There 's no future in romance . It never lasts long enough . " This is the letter that Paul writes for Toshi . Dear Jane , I 'm sorry it 's taken me so long to respond to your letters . I did n't want to reply without taking the time to think  | carefully about our relationship . I think we should no longer see each other . It 's not because I do n't want to be with you . I do . I want to be with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm trying to say . I 'm in awe of you . You 're such an extraordinary woman that you 've overwhelmed me , and my life . I 'm afraid I 'm not ready for such an intense relationship . I hope you 'll agree that this is for the best . I will see you in class next week . Toshi " Literate yet firm . This should do the trick . " Paul folds the letter up and sticks it in Toshi 's shirt pocket . " Do you think she 'll believe I wrote it ? " " She 'll believe it because it says what she wants to hear . " A young , handsome Thai waiter brings their bowls of coconut ice cream . " Thank you . " Paul runs his hand through his bright red hair . " Do you come from Bangkok ? I 've been to Bangkok many times . It 's my favorite city . " He gives him his most charming smile . " I 'm very interested in Thai culture . " The next morning , Toshi sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own handwriting . He sits facing the balcony , his futon still laid out on the floor next to him . Outside , the sky is busy with helicopters and blimps . He looks down at the white sheet of paper .  | " WHEN WE JAPANESE WRITE PERSONAL LETTERS , WE write vertically , from top to bottom , and from right to left , do n't we ? " Toshi 's ninth-grade English teacher , Mrs. Hayashi , pointed with a stick to a demonstration letter already printed in neat , even columns on the blackboard . " We follow a prescribed form , and we do not deviate , correct ? First , a comment on the weather . Next , we inquire after our correspondent 's health . " She put down her stick and looked out the window at the frozen athletic field where the first snow of autumn was falling in thick , wet flakes . Boys in rugby shorts , their legs red from the cold , stood in a straight line and bowed in perfect unison to their coach . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizontally , left to right , there is no form for writing personal letters . People write anything they please , anything that comes into their heads at all , and in any order . " A murmur of disbelief ran through the class like a school of fish passing just below the water 's surface .  | Heads swiveled and eyes widened . Toshi pictured an American letter : words running in every direction , in circles , upside down , crisscrossing on a sheet of red , white , and blue paper . In back of him , someone whispered , " America sounds good , does n't it ? I want to go to America . " Mrs. Hayashi clapped her hands and the class was silent . " In America , there is no order . " Each student was to write a personal letter in English to someone in America . If they had no one to write to , their teacher , who had lived for two years in a place called Portland with her sister 's family after her own husband 's fishing boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and addresses of schoolchildren . After they handed in their letters and Mrs. Hayashi corrected them , they would copy them over and then actually mail them . The only person Toshi knew in America was Audrey Hepburn , so he wrote his letter to her . He worked on it every night after he finished his other homework . On the morning it was due , he woke up very early and , without disturbing his father , went downstairs and switched on the rice cooker for their breakfast . In the back room , he put on the water for tea . It was still dark when he turned on the heat lamp under the kotatsu and slid his legs under the padded quilt , so he saw only his own reflection in the window : a sleepy-faced  | boy with a crewcut , a white sweatshirt with a bold pink English inscription in reverse . STRAWBERRY BOY . LET 'S PLAY VIOLENT SPORTS EVERY DAY . He began to write , horizontally , left to right . When he looked up again , blue light was washing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and woke up the red foxes and the antelope . He wrote : Dear Miss Audrey Hepburn , It is almost winter here in Hokkaido , Japan , where I live . It is very cold , but I do n't mind . How are you ? Are you fine ? Is your health well ? I am hoping for you . I and my mother saw your film Roman Holiday . Yes . It was my birthday when I was nine years old . It was my first movie in English . I did n't understand the words . But you were the most beautiful woman , I think . After you take a haircut . Now I saw after that many movies you act . Breakfast at Tiffany 's , Funny Face , Sabrina , The Nun 's Story . These movies are videotapes . Your movies can be easy to see in Japan , did you know ? All Japanese people likes you very much , I am happy to tell you . Because you are beautiful and a good actor . It 's true . The Nun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried . Really . Just please ask my mother . Now I am fourteen year old boy . I like to draw pictures . I will send you some pictures . Maybe if you come to Japan I can meet you ? Do you think so ? I am learning English . You can come to Hokkaido and you can stay at Hiraiwa , it is like a hotel where my mother is . You do n't have to  | pay money . We are so happy if you can visit . Do you know about Japanese bath and bed ? We do n't have bed . Do n't worry . I will explain to you . It is a problem ? When do you make the next movie ? Do you like Japanese food ? I hope you will read my letter . Can you answer it ? I will wait . If it takes many time , do n't worry . Your friend , Toshiyuki Okamoto ( let 's call me Toshi ! ) He put his letter in a big envelope along with two sketches  --  one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cover of the Breakfast at Tiffany 's videotape . He addressed the envelope to : Miss Audrey Hepburn , Hollywood , California , USA . Three months later , he received a manila envelope with an autographed black-and-white photograph of Audrey Hepburn and a letter . Dear Toshiyuki Okamoto : Thank you so much for your kind letter . I 'm so glad you enjoy my films . Hearing from fans is such a pleasure . It 's what makes my work worthwhile . As you may know , I no longer make films very often . Instead , I am fortunate to be involved with UNICEF , and am busy traveling the world , trying very hard to make sure that children everywhere are well fed and healthy . It 's difficult but rewarding work . Good luck in all your endeavors . My very best wishes , Audrey Hepburn  | The letter was typed , but Audrey Hepburn had signed her own name . Toshi framed the letter and the photograph and gave them to his mother to keep in her room at the inn . Granny often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually , she asked Taro to hang them on the dining room wall . Over the years , almost everyone in town stopped by to have their own photographs taken standing next to Audrey Hepburn 's letter and autographed picture . Of course we must stop seeing each other . I was about to write to you and tell you just that when I received your letter . Did you really think I wanted to continue this foolish relationship ? No ! Never ! An errant gust of spring wind blows in through the open balcony doors to lift the single page of Jane 's third letter off the table . The sexual attraction is too powerful , it controls us . It possesses us . We are wild animals . A nasty monkey and a dangerous tiger . The monkey riding on the tiger 's back .  | The letter rises up into the air , pauses for a moment , then floats back down to the tabletop . The tiger 's back . Your back , smooth as silk . The silk lining of her mother 's mink coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother 's coat , the silk rubbed against her bare arms , covered her face like a hot rush of blood , a wonderful dark death . The letter arrived during the night while he slept , dropped through the front-door mail slot . The red envelope bore neither postmark nor stamp . Toshi checked the lock on the door . The cherry trees are in bloom . We 'll say good-bye tonight at Aoyama Cemetery . Under a blossoming cherry tree . Surrounded by those sad gravestones . Our farewell . Six o'clock . The north entrance . I 'll go . If I do n't , she 'll never stop writing to me , he thinks as he neatly folds the letter back into the envelope and puts it in the drawer with the others . If I do n't go tonight , her letters will never stop arriving . He imagines the envelopes piling up by the front door like a red snowdrift , waiting for him each morning when he wakes up . And Jane writes like a crazy person . Like there are no rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to come , " she says shyly , then she lifts the hem of her white dress and curtsies.  | In the soft fading light , she looks so pretty and innocent , her hair tied back with a white scarf . Is this really the same woman who wrote those letters ? " I was looking forward to it , " he says impulsively as , against his will , he feels himself being charmed by her . She smiles . A shopping bag in one hand , she takes his arm with the other and leads him down the crowded path . Soon , they enter a grove of cherry trees . " Oh , look ! " She drops her bag and runs to the center of the grove . Petals settle on her dark hair like snowflakes . Enclosed in a circle of gravestones , she spreads her arms wide . " Look at me , Toshi ! " she shouts . Everyone around them turns . What is she doing ? She whirls round and round , making herself dizzy , until she falls back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down like a bird . Someone in the crowd says , " She 's having a seizure ! " " No , just a weird foreigner . " Toshi runs to her . But Jane 's laughing . " Look , Toshi ! Look ! I 'm a snow angel ! " Under the bursting trees , families and young couples and groups of office workers sit  --  men cross-legged ; women , their legs tucked under them  --  their shoes  | lined up in neat rows , toes pointing out , at the edges of their plastic mats . The soy-and-sugar smoke of basted meat and shellfish grilling on hibachis mixes with cigarette smoke in the cool air . Bottles of sake and beer and wine are opened . Wooden chopsticks click like cicada legs , their sound filling the darkening night . Toshi and Jane sit facing each other on a bedsheet . " This is good wine , " he says , sipping out of a plastic cup . He 's not just being polite . It is good . " Some guy was selling it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive , but I put a spell on him . I used my powers to charm him into selling it to me for almost nothing . " She stares into his eyes as if she is trying to put a spell on him too . Petals float down out of the darkness and settle on the food as she spreads it out between them . " A multicultural dinner , " she says , arranging cheese and crackers , then sushi , on paper plates . She produces a pocketknife from the shopping bag and slices a red apple into wedges . The apple is perfectly round , the flesh pale . Somewhere a switch is pulled , and the paper lanterns strung from the trees flicker , then glow , casting a warm light on the white blossoms . " Oh , how wonderful . It 's like we 're in a snow cave , an enchanted tunnel of light , " Jane whispers . She closes her eyes and lets her head roll back , exposing her neck and the shadowy outline of her breasts . He feels himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , " she whispers . A man strums a guitar . A woman sings . Jane opens her eyes and smiles . She looks sweet and eager , not at all like a person who could have written those letters . Maybe he 's been wrong about her . She puts a slice of cheese on a wedge of apple and holds it up . He opens his mouth , and she slides the cheese and apple in , leaving her fingers to rest lightly on his tongue . He closes his eyes , and she slowly withdraws her fingers across his teeth and lips . He imagines her tongue in his mouth . He chews and swallows , tasting the sharp cheese , his eyes still closed . The guitar player strums an old folk song , and more people join in the singing . The rim of a plastic cup touches his lips . Jane pours wine into his mouth . He is getting drunk . " Drink . Drink , " she says , emptying the cup , then taking it away . His mouth opens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke . He 's happy . He feels something , a startling sharpness , then a shiver of alarm . He opens his eyes . The gleaming blade of the pocketknife runs across his thumb . Blood . She grabs his hand , jams his thumb in her mouth , and sucks on it . " What ! " p 99 He pulls his hand away just as her teeth clamp down , scraping his skin . He stands up and backs away from her . " I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to , " she says . Beneath his stocking feet , he is aware of the cold ground , twigs , and sharp stones . Jane sits calmly and looks up at him , a drop of blood on her lower lip . She 's still holding the knife . " What are you doing ? " he asks , too loudly , suddenly afraid . People turn to look . " You see , I 've never been without someone to love , " she says . A red stain blossoms on her white dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throb . Beads of blood . Beads of sweat drip down his face . " You cut me , " he says stupidly . He does n't know what to say , what to do now . She has the knife . Should he try to take it away from her ? " You 're just trying to make it interesting , are n't you ? " she says softly , as if she is talking a child to sleep . " I know that . You 're not really leaving me . That 's all right . I understand . I like it interesting too . " She picks up the apple and continues to slice it as if nothing has happened , and his blood smears on the pulp . A gust of wind stirs up the cherry blossoms and blows petals all over their plates of food .  | " Oh ! " Jane cries , as if she 's been hurt . She jumps up . " Look ! Look ! Now it 's ruined ! " She bursts into tears . The guitar player stops playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says , his voice now gentle . He needs to calm her down . " You 've ruined everything . You tricked me , " she yells . What is she saying ? She 's not making any sense . And then , in Japanese : " I 'm not a whore ! " Now everyone around them is quiet . Where did she learn that word ? She 's never spoken to him in Japanese before . Everyone is watching them . " But you cut me , " he says , foolishly holding up his thumb to her , as if she might not remember . " Leave me alone ! " she yells . She picks up a cup of the red wine and throws it in his face . Somebody gasps . Jane backs away , stumbles over people and their dinners . She knocks over their bottles of beer and wine and overturns grills . Children cry . Careening backward , scattering glowing charcoal with her bare feet , she weaves through the gravestones and glowing trees like a ghost , and disappears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TAKES HIM TO GET BACK TO HIS apartment , Jane has already left three messages on his answering machine . He washes and bandages his thumb , then strips off his wine-stained clothes and throws them into the washing machine on his balcony . Naked , he stands outside and listens to her voice . The night air is cool , but the lights of the city burn . Blazing banks of white illuminate the National Stadium . Tokyo Tower is outlined in red . Her first message , her voice strangely calm , as if her words are weighed down by water . " Are you there ? " She waits . Then , " You should n't have said all those nice things to me . Because you did n't mean them , did you ? " She sighs . " Maybe it was the wine . The wine was a mistake . We should n't have gotten drunk . I have n't been sleeping well . I 'm up all night , then I 'm too tired to get anything done during the day . I just wander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted but too restless to sleep . I cancel my classes and I do n't go out . " She strikes a match and lights a cigarette . " I have this antique kimono . It 's silk and very , very old . Ancient . I stay at home all day and wrap myself  | up in it . You 'd like it . I wear nothing else , I 'm naked underneath . The kimono is green , the color of the seaweed you wrap around rice . " She blows smoke into the mouthpiece . " I 'll probably be fired . What do you think about that ? No , the kimono is not green . I did n't lie to you , I imagined the color . It 's the color of a sliced pomegranate , pale , and so fragile it would crumble if you touched it . Sunlight turns it to dust . " She pauses , and he listens to her breath . Water running . Jane has a cordless phone . He can see her . She exhales smoke , paces in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reveal themselves to their samurai lovers . Does Jane really have a kimono ? Or is it a lie ? " Please call me right away . I need to talk to you . It does n't matter what time . I do n't sleep anymore . " She hangs up . Ten stories below his balcony , huge arc lamps light up a road repair crew as they shatter the pavement with jackhammers . Salarymen and taxi drivers drift out of a ramen shop like daubs of blue smoke . Toshi looks for Jane on the street , but there 's no sign of her . Unless she 's hiding in dark doorways . But she 's not that crazy , is she ? He looks at his thumb . He backs away from the railing . The second message . " You 're not home yet ? Where are you ? Maybe you 're still at the cemetery . You met someone else there ,  | someone prettier , another American woman who wo n't give you trouble like I do . " Something shatters . " Shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did I really say that ? Another American woman . I am so pathetic . Erase this from your message tape . " She takes a long drag on her cigarette . " I never used to say things like that . I used to be a nice girl . " She coughs . " Did I ever tell you about my Vietnamese boyfriend ? When I was in high school ? He was ten years older . He had tattoos on both arms , and a motorcycle . My father hated him . " He hears her open the refrigerator . " But my father 's an asshole . " She sighs loudly , and he pictures this : She kneels down and stares , disappointed , at the refrigerator 's bare shelves , its damp whiteness . A shriveled lemon . An empty , crusted bottle of soy sauce . A bottle of vodka . " Are you angry at me ? Do n't be . I mean , I can understand how you could be , but I did n't mean to hurt you . I just wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouts , startling him , " I wanted you to notice me ! " She whispers , " I 'm sorry . Please call me . " The third message . She is angry . " Oh , I know Japanese men think it 's a big adventure sleeping with American women , you think all American women are sexually promiscuous , do n't you , that we 're whores and that you can treat us badly and it does n't matter . "  | She starts to cry . Toshi almost feels sorry for her , but he catches himself . This is a trick . Everything she does and says is a lie . " But what you do n't understand is that I 'm in love with you and , oh God , I ca n't , Toshi listen to me . " She 's slurring her words . She 's drunk . She 's on drugs . " I need to I need to touch you I need to touch the skin on the inside of your thighs , to let my head drop between your legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fall , do you know what I 'm saying . " He hears a muffled , hollow sound , as if she 's bumped into the wall . She drops the phone on the floor . " Oh . " Her voice is far away . Then , she 's back . But her words come slowly , and there is an odd gap between them , such a long interval that Toshi is surprised each time she continues . " I must make you understand this . I will do anything to touch you again I will stay in my room and wait for you . Are you listening ? Do you hear me ? I will wait for you I will be naked all the time touching myself imagining you . I 'm imagining you . " She hangs up . A dial tone . Toshi stays on the balcony . He 's shivering from the cold , but he wants only the night air and the darkness , to think about nothing . His thumb is throbbing . It 's still early , but he 's exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the subway ride home ,  | which was packed with drunken people out celebrating the cherry blossoms . When he was a boy , they taught him about cherry blossoms in school . About the moon . Maple leaves in the autumn . These things are special to the Japanese people , his teachers told him . The cherry trees bloom very late on Shiretoko Peninsula . There were no drunken crowds . Granny brewed tea from the blossoms , which they drank with homemade sweets that were fashioned into pinktinted petals and green leaves . Here in Tokyo , though , extra people-pushers are employed on the subways during cherry blossom season . Tonight , he had to wait for five trains to go by before there was enough room on one for him to be shoved aboard . He 'll call Paul . Paul will know what to do . He goes back inside , but just as he reaches for the phone , it rings . He jumps back , startled , then lifts the receiver . " Toshi ? Toshi Okamoto ? " It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says in English . " Hi . You probably do n't remember me . This is Lucy . We had dinner together on your birthday . With Jane and my husband , Hugh ? Remember ? " " Yes . I remember you . " Lucy . She was pretty . And charming . As she talks he recalls these things about her : Her long , bare arms . Her hands resting on the tablecloth , her strong fingers splayed . What was she ? A composer ?  | " I hope you do n't mind my calling you at home , but I have something I 'd like to talk to you about . It 's business . If you 're not too busy , I was wondering if we could get together sometime soon . " Is this a trick ? Did Jane ask her to call him ? But then he remembers : When they were introduced in front of the restaurant , he handed her his name card , with his home address and phone number printed on it . She took it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , from the Japanese side to the English and back again . " Yes . We can meet , " he says , deciding to take a chance . " Great . Great . " She really sounds pleased . Now he remembers more : Her short hair hooked behind her ears like window curtains pulled back to let in the sunlight . How she leaned over his birthday cake and puckered her lips . " Yes , " he says . " Great . " The washing machine stops spinning . He takes out his clothes and hangs them on the laundry pole to dry , all the while repeating their names in his head : Jane . Lucy . Jane . Lucy . The two American women encircle him in an endless parade  --  Jane in her moldering kimono , Lucy with her long arms and clear skin . They advance and retreat , their faces pressing up against his , unyielding and insistent . And ten stories below him , a procession of trucks rolls down the street , loudspeakers blaring . The radical Rice Party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have different digestive systems , and foreign rice can not be properly digested by our bodies . This is a world plot to destroy japan . " He goes back inside and slides the balcony door shut . He turns off his answering machine . He does n't want any more messages . He unfolds his mattress , shuts off the light , and finds himself in a Paris hotel room with Audrey Hepburn . They are being pursued by ruthless killers , and there is a gash on his back . Audrey cleans the wound . Her hands caress his skin . Outside the hotel room window , he sees the bare , gnarly branches of a cherry tree , in silhouette , on a background of pure white . WHEN HE WAS A SMALL BOY , TOSHI THOUGHT SAPlings buried under the snow were drowning . That their thin , bare branches sticking up out of snowdrifts were flailing arms . He 'd dig them out , to save them . But once it started snowing up on Shiretoko Peninsula , it did n't stop until spring . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day it would be buried again . His mother watched him from the back window one dark afternoon , the clouds full and still . She put on her  | blue hooded parka , and together they walked along the bottom of the slope . She walked ahead of him , and her green rubber boots made holes in the snow , shadows that he stepped into . He stayed close to her . Once she had walked off into the snow and had n't returned for hours . " What were you doing ? " she asked him . He told her . " But they 're not dying . They 're sleeping . Some plants , just like some animals , sleep under the snow , " she said . " The snow is a blanket . It protects them from the wind and keeps them warm until spring . " The clouds broke open , spilling out snow so fast and thick he thought that they could drown in it . She saw the doubt on his face . " Bears sleep under the snow . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagining the warmth of a bear curled up into a dark furry ball . " Come here . " She knelt down by two bony branches . " You 're right . They do look like hands . " She began to dig around them . He helped her . " Look . See these little knobs ? These will bloom in the spring . New branches will grow , and green leaves . See how healthy and happy this little tree looks ? " She held the limb in her gloved hand . Toshi took off his mitten and touched it . It did look alive . Snowflakes settled on his bare wrist and briefly revealed their intricate patterns .  | His mother took off her glove too and pressed the branch against his cheek . " Feel how warm it is ? " He felt the unexpected heat from her hand . He wished she would leave her hand there . She put his mitten back on for him and tucked it into his jacket sleeve . She stood up , and wiped the snow off her pants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow . Only people are weak , and need to put on heavy clothes and stay inside in the winter . " " But being a person is better than being an animal or plant , is n't it ? " He did n't want to live under the snow , alone all winter . As he looked up at her , snowflakes caught on his eyelashes . He wiped them away . " I do n't know if that 's so , " she said . It had n't really been a question , but her answer did n't surprise him . He was already accustomed to his mother 's abrupt and unexplained sadnesses . Without warning , a look of despair would sink into the skin of her face like a great weight . She seemed to be thinking of somewhere far away , someplace he 'd never been and could never go . Toshi suddenly felt cold . " Mother ? " The snow fell in a thick curtain around them . He could barely make out the yellow light from the noodle shop . But she stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something there other than the dim outlines of trees .  | " Mother ? " His mittens were wet . He wanted to go inside . She put a finger to her lips , and pointed . He followed her gaze . A family of red foxes scampered across the top of the slope . She smiled . The yellow light from the noodle shop glowed brighter . The light rushed out to envelop him and warm him . " GOOD DOGGY , GOOD DOGGY . Do You WANT TO play with Toshi for a while ? " Mami coos at the tiny white dog sitting on her desk . The dog wags its fluffy tail . " Toshi-chan , you want to play with Wan-chan ? " Toshi looks up from the storyboard on his desk . " No , thank you . Not right now . " His bandaged thumb makes it difficult for him to draw . The characters before him look edgy , the flesh of their skin bleeding onto their clothes . Akira comes in the door and removes his Walkman headphones . From across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? Another dog ? " " Come meet Wan-chan , " Mami says .  | " Just for an hour again ? " " No , Wan-chan is ours forever . " Akira shakes his newly dreadlocked hair , and white grains of rice clatter to the floor . " They 're still at it ? " Toshi asks . " At what ? " Nakamura turns away from the window and the rainy sky , sweeping smoke from his face as if brushing hair out of his eyes . " Those crazy farmers have set up barricades in front of Mitsukoshi department store , " Akira says . " They 've dumped truckloads of rice . " The fluffy dog blinks his eyes faster and faster , and then his bark weakens . " Yip , yip , yip , yip . " His tail stops wagging and he tips over , headfirst , onto the desk . Toshi smells something burning . " Oh dear , he 's died , " Mami says . " Naughty dog . " " What ? Died ? " Akira says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the head . " Mami hits the dog . Wan-chan shudders violently , then wags his tail . " Yip , yip , yip . " " Why , he 's only a silly toy . " " He 's not silly . He 's cute . And he 's much better than a real dog . Always friendly , are n't you . " She picks Wan-chan up and cuddles him . " But you ca n't love a stuffed toy . " " It 's not stuffed . It 's filled with computer chips , " Nakamura says . " That dog cost me forty thousand yen . Still , less than a rental dog in the long run . " " You need a boyfriend , not a toy dog , " Akira says .  | " Maybe you should ask Toshi to take you out on a date . He 's a nice , trustworthy guy . Not like me . " " Mind your own business . Besides , Toshi only likes American women . He thinks they 're more exciting than we Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . That 's not true , " Toshi lies . " Do n't distract Toshi . He 's working . Which is what you two should be doing , " Nakamura says . " I do n't know why I pay you . " " Now , Sensei , you know you ca n't rush talent . We creative types need freedom . " Akira dons his headphones again and does an exaggerated , jerky dance across the room . Grains of rice fly from his hair and roll across the storyboard on Toshi 's desk , where panels of faceless characters wait to be filled in . A pair of high heels materializes on the white paper , runs across wet pavement . A wom-an 's hand nervously clutches a metallic pistol . American women , Toshi thinks . Why do I like American women ? They 're only trouble . Today he wants to forget about them and concentrate on his work . But he ca n't . The white bandage on his thumb is unraveling . The running woman is Jane , and she pursues him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded underground passageways , past shoe stores and coffee shops , noodle stands , and travel agency kiosks plastered with sunny advertisements for vacations in Hawaii , Guam , and Saipan . In front of a poster of two bikinied girls tossing a beach ball , a homeless man grills rice balls over a fire  | he 's built inside a hubcap . The smoke stings Toshi ' s eyes but makes him hungry too . The man feeds the fire with old magazines , tossing in a cover photo of the Crown Prince . " Desperate Search for Bride Continues " goes up in flames . Paul is standing in a long line outside the Texas Steak House , talking to a young Japanese man . " Toshi , this is Ueda-san . Ueda-san , this is my good friend Okamoto-san , " Paul says . Toshi bows . Ueda bows lower , giving Toshi a top view of his close-cropped athlete 's haircut and broad shoulders . He looks about fifteen years old . Paul says very quickly in English : " He does n't understand English so just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you 're saying . " Ueda smiles and takes out a pack of Happy cigarettes , lights up . " High school ? " Toshi asks . " Do n't be cruel . He 's in his first year at the Physical Education University . He plays soccer . And he 's very intelligent . " A waitress , her uniform a pattern of buffalo heads and American flags , moves down the line with a clipboard and menus . " No American steaks today . Only Kobe beef , fish , and the salad bar . " She smiles brightly . " We 're boycotting American beef . The rice thing , you know . " She  | hands Toshi a slip of paper . " Three of you ? Here 's your number . You should be seated in about an hour . " " You know , you could really be in danger . " Paul holds Toshi ' s bandaged thumb between his own smooth thumb and forefinger , and turns it back and forth . Ueda has gone back to the salad bar for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with crumpled napkins , prawn tails , shredded lettuce , squished packets of ketchup , mayonnaise , mustard , and soy sauce . " I mean , she 's obviously crazy . That whole thing at Aoyama Cemetery . And those last phone messages . " " Maybe if I do n't answer her , she 'll forget about me . " He does n't really believe this . " You should move into my apartment for a while . She does n't know where I live , does she ? " " No . I never told her about you . " Paul frowns . Toshi changes the subject . " I forgot to tell you . Lucy called me . " " Who ? " " She 's this really nice woman I met the night Jane took me out for my birthday . " Paul leans back in his chair and shakes his head . " When will you learn ? " " Learn what ? " " Learn that when you mess with American women you 're in over your head . " Toshi looks up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like Jane . " p 115 " You met her through Jane . She 's Jane 's friend . " " She 's a composer . " " Oh , God . " " She wants to see me . " " Go . But do n't come complaining to me if you wake up with a knife in your back . " A knife in his back ? Could Lucy do that ? Jane could . They 're Americans , after all . Jane has a pocketknife . Does she have a gun too ? Does it even matter ? Toshi 's seen it in the movies and on the news : Anything can be a murder weapon in the hands of an American . They kill one another frequently , nonchalantly , and with everyday ob-jects  --  hammers and golf clubs . Plastic dry cleaning bags . He picks up his fork and examines the sharp prongs . Ueda returns , his plate piled high with lettuce , and topped with scoops of red and yellow Jell-O , chocolate pudding , and whipped cream . " American salads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look delicious , until he mashes it all together with his fork and spoon . " He 's sweet , is n't he ? " " I guess so . " " He is . His boyish enthusiasm is refreshing . And he 's quite intelligent . " " You already said that . " " And you of all people have no right to judge . A composer . God . Let me guess . New Age . She mixes whale songs with Chinese harps and Balinese gamelan , or something like that . "  | Toshi does n't say anything . He does n't like Paul when he 's like this . " I 'm sorry . I was trying , but obviously failed , to be funny . Look , at least come spend the night tonight . I seriously do n't think you should go home . " " What about him ? " They both look at Ueda , who grins as he lights up another Happy cigarette . His face is bright red from drinking beer . " Oh , you know , " Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toshi and Paul are in the kitchen , waiting for the tea water to boil . Ueda is in Paul 's bedroom watching an American porn video , and the soundtrack , audible in the kitchen , makes Toshi uncomfortable . Heavy breathing . Moans and groans . Two men having sex sounds to him like a car accident . Ueda yells from the bedroom , " This is fantastic . Are all Americans so big ? " Paul sighs . " Okay , so he 's young . Were n't you like that when you were young ? " " No . " Paul turns the gas off under the whistling kettle and opens a cabinet . " Choose a cup . " Ueda yells again , " Is there more beer ? " " Oops . That 's my cue . " He takes a beer can from the refrigerator . " He should be sufficiently warmed up by now . " p 117 " Good luck , " Toshi says . Then Paul is gone . The bedroom door slams shut . Toshi is left staring into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shapes . When he 's alone in Paul 's kitchen , Toshi likes to open up all the cabinets and cupboards and drawers , the refrigerator and freezer , even the dishwasher . The surfaces in the kitchen are all white and immaculate , but inside , the colors and shapes , the variety and quantity of Paul 's possessions , overwhelm him . Some of the appliances he 'd never seen before he came to Tokyo , could n't even guess their purpose when he saw them : The food processor , the pasta maker , the coffee grinder . The espresso machine . The juicer . He chooses a white mug with a smiling cow face , then opens another cupboard . Tins and jars filled with teas . Herbal tea . Chinese tea . Green tea . Indian tea . Apple , peach , rose hip , Sleepy time , jasmine and oolong and Iron Buddha . English Breakfast . Passion Punch . He takes out a tin of Darjeeling and places it on the counter next to a tall glass jar filled with spaghetti . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and takes it into the living room . The floor-to-ceiling shelves are filled with books , pottery , woven baskets , and antique Buddhas from Paul 's travels through Asia . The walls are covered with woodblock prints and calligraphy scrolls . A Noh mask . Behind the dining room table , an old embroidered Chinese robe , black and red and gold silk , is stretched nd hung on a bamboo pole like a piece of art . Toshi  | loves Paul 's apartment , but sometimes he feels confused with so many things around him , so much to look at and admire . It makes him anxious , for he feels obligated to keep looking . His own small apartment is almost as empty as the rooms he grew up in above the noodle shop . There is nothing on the walls except for one woodblock print of a captive samurai , his wrists tied behind his back . By the nineteenth-century artist Yoshitoshi , it was a gift from Paul for his college graduation . When he first met Paul , Toshi asked him why he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being lonely , " he said . " When I find a real boyfriend , then I 'll throw out everything and live like a monk . " He wondered at the time if Paul was joking . Now he wonders : If my father-and I had had more things at home , would I have felt less lonely growing up ? STEAM ROSE UP PAST THE SECOND-FLOOR WINDOW . Pale moths passed through it and into the room , their wings heavy with moisture . They cast whirling shadows , which fragmented , and then they flew back out p 119 into the black night . Sounds drifted up from the open bathroom window . Toshi heard the scrub brush scrape his father 's pale skin , a splash of water , then the stool shift on the tile floor as his father stood , then lowered himself into the tub . Before his mother left them , his father often took Toshi into the bath with him , sat him down outside the tub , and washed his back with a sea sponge . Since his mother left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of the back room in a new sketchbook Granny had given him . With crayons , he drew the kotatsu table , its wooden surface scarred with dark rings , years of hot teacups . The fluorescent light hanging from the ceiling , and the moths circling it . The two blue floor cushions he and his father sat on every day . His father stepped out of the tub , and his wet feet slapped the raised wooden planks . The bathwater dripped off his body to the tile floor . Toshi drew a vase on the table and filled it with branches of wolf willow . He colored the vase blue . On the wall next to the window , he added a framed drawing , one of his own . Against the opposite wall , the narrow tansu that had sat there for years . On top of it , his collection of seashells and rocks . His father fit the cover on the tub , a dull thump of wet wood on metal . Now that his mother was gone they often used the same water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He listened to his father walk  | from the bathroom into the shop and open the refrigerator , pictured the sudden cold air and white light on his face . Toshi added a wall calendar to his drawing . He shaved down the point of his black crayon and neatly drew in the character for the month of July . He heard the hiss of released air as his father opened a can of beer , then his slow steps on the stairs . He kept drawing as he came into the room and stood over him . Toshi wore only a pair of cotton shorts . He felt the heat of the bath radiate from his father 's body . " Here , for you . " His father bent down and placed a glass of cold barley tea on the table , away from the drawing . " Thank you , " he said without looking up . He drew in the borders of the tatami mats , the color of moss . He put his crayon down and drank some tea . His father stood over him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing . " " Thank you . " His praise surprised Toshi . He was n't a critical man , it was just that he rarely offered an opinion . " But , well , that 's not really what the room looks like , is it ? " his father said . Toshi looked at the picture he 'd drawn , then at the room . " No , it is n't . " In the room where they lived , there was no vase filled with wolf willow . No calendar or framed picture on the wall . No tansu . There was only the bare fluores-  | ent light , the kotatsu , and the two old floor cushions . Nothing else . After his mother left them , his father sent the tansu over to Utoro in a truck . It was in her room now at the inn . Toshi 's framed drawing was hanging there too . Last year 's calendar came down at the New Year and was never replaced . His father had slowly emptied the two upstairs rooms , and kept them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rice . After walks in the woods , he emptied his pockets of small and perfect pinecones , like bunched brown fists . I ! is father put them all away in the closet . They lived in silent , empty rooms . In the front room , they took their mattresses and quilts out of the closet at night , and then folded them up and put them back each morning . That was all . The rooms felt abandoned . Outside the windows , the sea . The wind . Sunlight and moonlight . White birch . Seasons changed . Leaves fell . At dusk , the stars appeared . In the spring , bear cubs tumbled down the steep slope . The fishermen shouted to one another as they returned in their boats each afternoon . Toshi pushed open the front windows , and he could smell their catch . Dark holds filled with layers of fish gasping for air , the fish on top throwing themselves against the walls of the hold , trying to escape . Dying fish still caught in nets , the nets now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S AN AMUSEMENT PARK ON THE ROOF OF SEIBU department store . On a clear night , the twinkling complexity can be seen from as far away as the summit of Mount Fuji . Lucy waits in front of the Ferris wheel . It is the first hot night in May , and the Ferris wheel revolves languidly , its colored lights blinking and burning , vanishing into the low clouds that trap the day 's heat and the smoke from hundreds of millions of cigarettes lit , inhaled , exhaled , then ground out on the streets of Tokyo . The night air is tobacco scented . Mercury rises . Neon light wraps itself around buildings to define both shape and distance . Lucy looks cool , dressed in black , her long arms bare . Leaning on air . She smiles , then waves , even though he 's up so close . " Hi . It 's so nice to see you . " " Yes , " he says , nervous . She laughs , relaxing him . " You 're not supposed to say yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , too . ' " She takes his arm easily , a gesture she does n't seem to think about . " Come on . I 'm starving . And thirsty . "  | He 's charmed by her straightforwardness . Americans can say , This is what I want , let 's go get it now . She leads him across the roof , moving in and out of light and darkness . She 's a quarter step ahead , so he can admire the shape of her head , the moment where her bare neck disappears into the wavering shadow her shirt casts . The frosty floodlights on her skin . A blond foreigner in a T-shirt and bathing suit seats them under a striped beach umbrella in the " Let 's California Beer Garden . " Painted ocean waves splash over the tables and chairs ; on a giant wall mural , Madonna and Charlie Sheen hover on surfboards in front of a psychedelic sunset . The music is loud . To hear each other , they have to lean across their round table . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know them ? " " Beach Boys ? " " The music . Never mind . It 's not at all important . In fact , it 's silly . All of this . " She opens her arms and looks around . " I mean , look at this . Where are we ? Tell me that . Where are we ? " Toshi thinks for a moment . " Shibuya . Tokyo . Japan , " he tells her . And she laughs . She has nice teeth . Her thick eyebrows and short hair remind him of Audrey Hepburn in Funny Face . Audrey the former bookstore clerk being photographed by Fred Astaire in Paris . Their waiter reappears with a pad and pen . They order impulsively , intrepidly , calling out items from the  | menu to each other like a word game . Salad . Pizza . Potato . A pitcher of beer . Toshi feels emboldened by her presence . " You know , I tried calling your home number a few times , but you were n't in and your answering machine was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been staying with a friend . " " What 's wrong with your apartment ? " " Nothing ? " " Oh , well . " She drums her fingers on the table , smiles at him . " It 's nice to stay somewhere else sometimes . I understand that . You must get sick of your own place . " When is she going to talk to him about Jane ? Is n't that why she asked to meet him ? He 's expecting her to tell him something , to give him a message . The beer arrives , a big , sweating pitcher . Toshi pours . " You want to talk about Jane ? " he asks . " About Jane ? Well , okay . " She looks surprised . " If you 'd like . How is Jane ? " " Do n't you know ? " " I have n't seen Jane since your birthday dinner . She was Hugh 's friend , not mine . And he and I split up . " " You and Hugh ? " " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she is n't sure whether he 'll consider it good or bad news . " I 'm sorry . "  | " It 's not a sorry thing . Really . We 're still best friends . There was no fighting . We both wanted it to be over . We got married right out of college . We were way too young . And then we grew up , you know ? " He shakes his head . " I do n't know . " She makes it sound so effortless , and inconsequential . Is that what happened to his parents ? Did they grow up ? For the rst time , it occurs to him that he might have been the reason they stayed together as long as they did . If Lucy nd Hugh had children , then would it be a " sorry thing " ? " I did n't mean to make it sound so trivial , " she says . ' It 's a habit I have , not wanting to make people un-comfortable . " " It 's okay , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Have you ever studied aikido ? " " No , never . " He 's confused . Lucy speaks slowly and clearly , so her words are easy to understand . But the connections are hard to make . She leaps blithely from idea to idea . Does aikido have something to do with divorce ? " Well , try it . It 's amazing . " " In what way ? " " In many ways . It 's a kind of spiritual therapy . It teaches you to concentrate , to focus , to be calm . " He learned calm in high school English class . They sat tensed at their desks , pencils in hand , and listened 126 Alan Brown to taped news broadcasts and to weather reports . It was always calm after a battle , calm before a storm . " Are n't you calm ? " he asks . She smiles . " I 'm often calm , but not always , no . I 'm calm right now . " He wants to ask her more . He inexplicably feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food arrives , and the table is covered with platters . Lucy serves them both , moving her chopsticks over the potato salad , the tomato salad , the jellyfish salad , arranging the shapes and colors on their plates into pictures . Then he starts to tell her about Jane , and she puts down the chopsticks and listens . Before he is finished , she leans across the table to take his hand . " You do know about Jane , do n't you ? " she asks so seriously it unnerves him . " No . I do n't know . " " Oh , God . " She removes her hand from his and fans the air , as if waving away bad things . " Listen to me , " she says , very slowly . " Jane has had a terrible , terrible time . " " A terrible time , " he repeats , and a shiver passes through him . He feels an unexpected thrill . He tries not to smile , but he ca n't help it . Lucy leaning across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her ikebana teacher ? Remember , at dinner that night ? " " When she was crying ?

I think he hurt her . " He blushes . Sex . He does n't know what to say . " I 'm sorry . I know it sounds awful . I do n't really know everything about it . Hugh told me . He 's known Jane since high school . She 's always been out of conol , apparently . And she 's always had this thing for Asian men . " " Thing , " he repeats aloud . A dark object , something heavy , metallic , floating in the air . You can hold it in the palm of your hand . " She only dates Asian men . I do n't know why . To honest , I think that American men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men seem to find her affected havior attractive . " Is Jane unattractive ? Is that what Lucys saying ? " Did she tell you she 's an actress ? " Lucy asks . " Yes . " " Hugh said that she 's never had an acting job in all the years he 's known her . But here she passes herself off as some big talent . Of course , so many foreigners come to Japan and do that . " He 's lost . What do foreigners do in Japan ? " But what happened ? With her ikebana teacher ? " " I do n't know exactly . Except that she fell apart . She  | drove Hugh and me crazy , calling a hundred times a day . Jane needs an audience for all of her dramas . " Jane falling apart . Jane breaking .

I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they 're suddenly aware of a rustling around them , a murmuring . Everyone has stopped eating and is staring up at the sky . Lucy and Toshi lean back in their chairs . A blimp sails silently over the rooftop of Seibu department store  --  a whale , a shadow , a dream  --  so low that a boy on the Ferris wheel reaches out to touch its shimmering surface . A blinking dispatch lights up their faces like heat lightning : INTERESTED IN MARRYING THE CROWN PRINCE ? QUALI FLED ? CALL THE IMPERIAL HOUSEHOLD AGENCY AT 1111-1111 . The dishes have been cleared away . " Why did you call and ask to meet me ? " he asks her . She smiles . " Thank you . I 'm having such a good time , I almost forgot that this is business .

" I do n't know any other manga artists . You 're it . " c smiles . " And I like you . " Ile smiles too , feeling seduced in a pleasant , reed way . " I 'd like to play you my music . You should hear it fore you decide . " " Yes , I 'd like to hear your music . " " Good . " She hands a pink business card across the table , English on one side , Japanese on the other . Lucy NK .

" " No , I do n't , " he says . And he really does n't , he 's beginning to realize . " Self-improvement . No matter who or what we are , we 're always working on ways to become somebody else . "  | THE SCHOOL BUS DROPPED HIM OFF , TURNED AROUND in the gravel , and rumbled back down the coast road . Toshi dropped his leather book bag on a patch of dirt by the back door . The aroma of simmering broth and the gunfire of a TV detective show floated out the open window . He started up the slope . He climbed uphill into the comforting smells of the forest . It was late September . The slope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasses that grew past his waist . He climbed above the drab concrete walls and blue tile roof of the noodle shop to a view of the dark sea . The Russian islands were ringed by clouds . He climbed above the screeching tires of a car chase . A woman 's scream sailed up the slope on a gust of wind , then the sounds of the TV faded into the tangled brush . Stopping in the shadow of a white birch , he pulled his shirt over his head , and wiped the sweat from his face and chest . He sat down and watched the upstairs window . The leaves of the bear berry were beginning to redden . A dragonfly alighted on a wildflower , and the stem bowed .  | An hour passed . Above his head , there were three colors in the world . Green leaves . White clouds . Blue sky . His mother 's face appeared at the back window . It was a face he thought he knew , but now it seemed more distant than the cloud-covered islands . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair loose . She was crying . Look up ! Please look up ! he called out silently through the wild grasses and the air busy with insects . Swarming mosquitoes were a dark smudge against the sky . But his mother just stared at the slope , which rose up at such a steep angle behind the shop that she often called it the " wall . " " Trapped between the wall and the sea , " she 'd sigh . He saw her lips move , but the angry sounds that carried up to him were the nonsensical language she spoke in her sleep . She turned abruptly , and he heard his father shout . His mother moved away from the window . " What are you doing ? He 'll be home soon . Do you want him to see you like this ? " He 'd never heard his father yell before , not at his mother , not at anyone . The words struck his bare chest like pitched stones , and he lost his breath . His father leaned out the window and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched the anger drain from his face and saw the sadness that replaced it . He pulled the window shut , and he was gone .  | Every afternoon when the school bus dropped Toshi off at the end of the road , his mother would be waiting at the front door . In the winter , the teakettle whistled on the stove top . In the summer , a glass of cold barley tea in the refrigerator . Yesterday , the front door had been closed . He 'd rushed inside , his stiff leather book bag bouncing on his back . His father was chopping green onions . One hand pushed the long stems forward , the other gripped the broad knife , its wooden handle as veined as his father 's arm . " She 's sick . You should n't bother her . " " What 's wrong ? What kind of sickness ? " His moth-er 's illnesses frightened him . " Do n't ask questions . Just stay down here and do n't make noise . " He did his homework at the counter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later , he had his dinner with the fishermen , who teased him about his growing boy 's body . " If you keep on like this , you 're going to be as tall as a foreigner . " " It must be his father 's cooking . " They all laughed , their sweat dripping into their bowls , hot food on a warm night . His father turned away to lift the lid off a pan of gyoza , releasing a cloud of steam , and someone gave Toshi a sip of beer . It tasted bitter , smooth as glass .  | They closed up the shop . He wiped the tables while his father poured green tea over rice and carried it upstairs . He could n't hear them talking . Whatever words passed between them were whispered . He waited . His father came down . " She 's feeling better now . You can go up . " His mother sat in the back room , her chopsticks hovering over her bowl of tea and rice , which had cooled uneaten . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stopped in the doorway , afraid to go farther . " I 'm sorry , Toshi-chan . I 'm not being a good mother , am I ? " " You 're a good mother , " he said , terrified she would stay sick and stop taking care of him . " Really , you 're a good mother . " " I 'll be better tomorrow . " But that night she slept alone in the back room . And this afternoon , when the school bus drove up to the noodle shop , the front door was closed again . The sun set , and three planets appeared in the September sky , bright as new ten-yen coins . Fireflies weaved through the dark forest like a procession of paper lanterns carried by invisible hands . The air cooled down , and he put on his shirt . His mother came up the hill , humming " Red Dragonfly , " a song she had sung to him the Sunday before when they 'd gone into the for-  | est to gather spoon ferns . Later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dinner . Her deep and pretty voice made him want to cry . She sat down next to him and leaned back against the tree trunk . Her hair was neatly tied behind her head again . " Are n't you hungry ? " He did n't answer her . " It 's so pretty up here at night . And cool . Funny we never think to walk up here after dinner . Well , from now on , let 's see if we can do it . " He wanted to talk to her , but he was angry , and afraid . He 'd always known that he had to be careful with her . Only recently was he beginning to understand that he could lose her . They both waited , listened to the shuffling behind them , the sounds of the forest accommodating the night . The sky grew black . Suddenly , far out at sea , there was a burst of bright orange light . The light bloomed silently , dancing wildly in the darkness . " Mother ... " " A fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they might be overheard . Her voice was a comforting rustle of leaves . The fire spread , its preternatural glow reflected on the gathering rain clouds . " Will someone put it out ? " he asked . " It does n't matter , " she said .  | " But people live there , do n't they ? " " I do n't want to talk about the islands , " she said , her voice far away . Now what had he said ? Lately , she drifted away from him so easily . There was nothing he could do to bring her back except wait . They sat a while longer , saying nothing , watching . Finally , his mother said , " I made dinner for you . It 's waiting . Shall we go down now ? " " Okay . " He was too hungry to stay angry at her . They started down the slope . The shop rose up and blotted out the flickering red sky , and they were plunged into darkness , as if into sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? " " Are you sick ? " He listened to her breathing . Was she afraid to tell him ? " No , I 'm not sick . I was sick , a long , long time ago . Way before you were born . But having you made me better . " " But yesterday . And today ... " " It was nothing . Only a little cold . " They reached the back door , and they both hesitated . On the other side of the door , his father sat alone in the dark , watching TV . He must be afraid of losing her too , Toshi realized . His father knew all about her sick-  | ness but told him nothing . Should n't they be doing something to help her ? On the TV , the Emperor , in hip-high rubber boots , waded through a rice paddy . " Toshi-chan , " she whispered . " Yes ? " " Please be nice to your father . You should always be very nice to your father . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Forget about me like you would a whore ? GARBAGE ? I 'm not a whore . Is that what you think of American women ? The phone starts to ring the moment he unlocks his front door . He does n't know why , but he counts the rings . Twenty , and then it stops . He locks the door , steps out of his sneakers into his slippers . There are three red envelopes on the floor by the mail slot , like red stains in the snow . Jane .  | Did I tell you ? I bought this exquisite antique birdcage at the flea market at Togo Shrine . On a cloudy Sunday morning . It 's delicate , it 's carved wood . Do n't breathe on it . Careful . He opens all three envelopes at once , fans the pages out , and studies them like pictures , like a collage . I bought two lovebirds . They 're my only friends now . At night I cover their cage with a silk cloth , it floats down over the cage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's handwriting , the English words , shock and seduce him . Please , please , please , I need to see you . I need to hear your voice or I 'll go crazy . Oh , yes , I could , I would , I swear . He touches the paper gently , and he bruises her flesh . She stays at home , in bed , and imagines you . Your chest and your stomach , your thighs . Your skin . She has you memorized . She thinks she would die if she could n't ever touch your skin again . Does that please you ? The sheets of paper tremble .  | Are you the devil sent to torture me ? I ca n't sleep nights . I lie in bed and I imagine your body pressing against mine and I have an orgasm . The doorbell rings . Sometimes she imagines that she will die in flames , that someone will set her on fire . The knob turns and he panics . Did he lock it ? Jane ? could it be someone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightens him . Then , silence . He is barely breathing . He waits , stays still , for five minutes , ten minutes . The curtains are open . The building across the street . Is she watching him ? He quietly pulls the curtains closed , tiptoes to the front door . He checks the lock , lifts the rusty chain , and slides that into place , too . The phone rings again . His heart pounding . Thirty rings , it stops , then begins again . Twenty rings . Why is he counting ? Is she counting too ? In the silence , he pulls out his old school duffel bag and throws in underpants , T-shirts , jeans . The doorbell rings again . Of course : She 's been calling from the pay phone on the corner . He goes to the door , looks through the peephole . Jane . Her face , distorted by the lens , is grotesque , her red lips swollen .  | She seems to look right at him , and he backs away . She pounds on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sinks down to the tatami , exhausted by her assault . She rings again , then drops a red envelope through the mail slot . He hears footsteps , the elevator door opens and closes . He waits , suspecting a trick . She did n't go down in the elevator , she 's hiding out-side . Suddenly drowsy , he picks up the envelope and puts it in his pocket . He lays down right on the tatami by the front door , and he falls asleep so fast it is as if he is falling down into blackness . Audrey Hepburn is being stalked in a dark apartment by a sadistic killer . She is blind . She stumbles . She trembles . She cries out . The killer strikes a match and illuminates her terror-stricken , yet still lovely face . The light of the flame flickers on her long , pale neck , then is snuffed out . Darkness . He does n't wake up until early the next morning , when an earthquake rattles the building and knocks a ceramic teacup filled with colored pencils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a potter , shatters , and the pencils scatter , arrange themselves into muddled ideographs . A reproach , Toshi imagines : Stay away from foreigners .  | A FEW YEARS AFTER TOSHI WAS BORN , GRANNY 'S SON , Taro , built her a one-room pottery shop across the street from his inn . The shop had driftwood walls and a peaked roof of corrugated tin , and one wide front window , framed in blue , that looked out onto the street . Every weekend , when he crossed the peninsula to stay with his mother , Toshi visited with Granny in her shop . In the winter , he carried firewood over from the inn for her stove , his small arms filled with powdery logs , his boots crunching on the snow and ice . Inside the door , he stepped out of his boots and into slippers . While he drew pictures with the paper and crayons she kept there for him , Granny swept the floor and dusted her pottery . She made them strong tea  --  dark and smoky , or pale green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' When the warm weather came , he walked with her in the meadows above town to gather wild blue irises and peach-colored lilies . They filled the big urns she displayed on the shop 's small porch to attract the tourists . The urns were dark as p 141 mud , the glaze mottled with ash and the thick green drippings of pine tree resin . Three or four times each year , when the local potters who lived in the hills fired their wares , Granny drove Taro 's pickup truck up to visit them and choose pieces for her shop . One Sunday , when Toshi was eleven , she asked him to come along . His mother was sick that weekend , and she did n't come out of her room . When Toshi knocked on her door , she would n't answer . " It 's better not to disturb your mother . She needs her rest , " Granny said . " Come with me . I can use your help , now that you 're so big and strong . " It was early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains . They followed the paved road up behind the middle school and over a series of low , indistinct ridges until first the town , then the sea , dropped from view . The asphalt ended . The dirt road was dry and hardened to the color of flesh . On the floor at Toshi 's feet , a crate of apples and dried fish . " Your mother does n't mean to upset you , " Granny said . " I know , " he said . It made him uncomfortable to talk about his mother with Granny . Besides , she was rarely sick since she 'd moved to the inn . " Where does this road go ? " he asked , anxious to change the subject . He 'd never been up here before . The road did n't seem to have a destination . It moved through the mostly uninhabited land between the two coasts , between his  | two homes . Riding on it excited him ; it was like thinking about a new idea for the first time : an expanse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve . The pickup truck was their boat . On one side , dark forest . Out the other window , sawed-off tree stumps , pale earth , and sky . " I do n't know where it goes . I 've been driving on it for years , but I just follow it , and it takes me where I 'm going . " She laughed . " Like life , is n't it ? " " What do you mean ? " His attention shifted to the treeline . A red fox stretched out in the sunlight . " Someday you 'll understand , " she said . Soon , puffs of smoke . A tin chimney . They rounded a curve and saw a log cabin set far back from the road , chopped firewood stacked up one side all the way to the sharply sloped roof . He opened the window and leaned his head out , as if the air might solve this mystery : Could someone really live out here , in the middle of emptiness ? The potter 's wife bowed when they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without speaking , and then she brought them cups of tea and a bowl of mandarin oranges . The house was one big room . A ladder led to a sleeping loft . Outside the wide front window , white clouds moved quickly across the peninsula , stretching themselves thin . Trembling light poured in and lit up the wooden table and the rough teacups so dramatically  | that Granny remarked on the changing colors in the clay . But behind the kitchen counter , the potter 's wife was in shadow . She seemed separated from them by a great distance . While they drank their tea , she stood at the counter and rolled out dark , speckled soba dough . Toshi watched her cut the dough into noodles , which she hung on the dish-drying rack and from the backs of chairs . The flour dusted her hands like gloves . It 's quieter than the sea in here , he thought . Iino , the potter , took them out to his workshop and kiln behind the house . Two pairs each of snowshoes and skis were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about children , but did n't ask . Everything here was unfinished , the shelves that held the pottery , the stools they sat on while Iino brought out pieces for Granny to look at . Iino was almost as silent as his wife . They both had long , braided ponytails that hung down their backs over faded blue overalls . Granny kept up a stream of friendly chatter as she chose teapots and cups , sake flasks , and bowls . The three of them wrapped everything in newspaper . When they were almost finished , Granny spoke to Toshi . " Why do n't you get your sketch pad from the truck and show Iino-san some of your drawings ? " She turned to the potter . " This boy is going to be a fine artist someday . " Toshi ran to the truck and brought back his pad . Would Iino like his drawings ? He 'd never shown them to a stranger before . He handed the sketch pad to the  | potter , who wiped his rough hands on his overalls , then opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he slowly turned the pages , taking his time with each drawing . They heard the back door of the house open and shut , then the potter 's wife 's shuffling footsteps on the dirt path . She carried in a blue glass bowl filled with peeled apple slices , placed it on the table without a word , and turned to leave . But at the door she paused . Without looking up she said in a voice almost too faint to hear , " What a handsome young boy . " And then she hurried out the door . Iino grunted but did n't look up from the sketch pad . Granny laughed and called out , " Thank you . " Toshi stared down at the table , aware of the blood coloring his cheeks . He was pleased . Was he really handsome ? " This one , " lino said finally , laying the pad down . It was a picture of the sea seen from the rooftop of the inn . Toshi had drawn it one Sunday morning while his mother hung out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delineated by roofs , by windows opened to a spring day . Damp sheets and socks clipped onto laundry poles . A pair of pants fluttered like a flag . Between two houses , a glimpse of a fishing boat 's mast . The white page and crayon-blue sea looked like a faraway , wet country on the dry , clay-covered tabletop . " This is a beautiful picture . Really it is , " Iino said , speaking directly to Toshi for the first time . " I 'd like to  | frame it and hang it in my house so I can see the sea every day . Would you trade it for one of my works ? " Granny clapped her hands . " That 's wonderful . Is n't it good that you came along , Toshi-chan . " Iino , a real artist , had praised one of his drawings , wanted to hang it in his own house . For the first time , Toshi felt desired . He experienced the potency of talent , and it made him dizzy . But he remembered his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very happy . Thank you very much . " Iino bowed too . " It 's an honor to meet another artist . " He took his time choosing a piece of pottery while Iino and Granny finished the packing . He picked up a tall , cylindrical teacup and carried it over to the open door . In the transparent light , the brown clay surface revealed itself : moss-covered riverbanks seen from above . The base was gray and speckled , a gravel riverbed . Toshi 's drawing would remind him of the sea , Iino had said . This cup reminded Toshi of mountain streams . He held the cup out to Iino . " Is this one all right ? " At the potter 's request , he signed his own drawing . " When you become a famous artist someday , it will be worth lots of money . Mr. Iino can sell it and retire , " Granny said , and she and Iino laughed . In the truck on the way home , he held the teacup in his hands and turned it around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Granny had said that the road they were on was like life . When Iino had called him an artist , he gave Toshi a map . Now he knew where he was going . It was dusk in the hills . When they crossed the last ridge in Taro 's truck , he was astonished by the radiance of the sunlight spilling off the spring sea . TOSHI-CHAN , ARE YOU SICK ? YOU LOOK TERRIBLE . " Mami shuffles across the studio in a bright orange kimono , an embroidered pattern of cranes circling the Empire State Building and the Eiffel Tower . Her face is powdered white as sugar , and her hair , adorned with daisies , swirls above it . She cocks her head and gazes intently into Toshi 's eyes . She looks like something sweet to eat , something that would leave his fingers sticky . " Yes , you are sick . You should rest . " Taking his arm , she leads him like a child over to his desk . Toshi follows passively . What does she see in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her face distorted , banging on his door ? He could never tell Mami . He knows what she would say . Foreigners . It 's his fault .  | He puts his duffel bag down . " Mami-chan , why are you so dressed up ? Are you off to a party ? " She spreads her arms and turns in a circle for him . " Do I look pretty ? Please tell me the truth . " Akira comes out of the toilet , zips up the fly on his baggy shorts . He 's had his nose pierced , and today a gold ring protrudes , matching the half dozen rings in his ears . " You did n't know ? Mami-chan 's going to marry the Crown Prince . She 's going to be the Empress of Japan someday . Better be nice to her . " He lights a cigarette . On his computer screen , Japanese fighter planes buzz a cartoon Hawaii . Bare-breasted , grassskirted girls dance the hula . " Is it true ? " " Do n't listen to Akira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audition at Tokyo Dome , but just for fun . I know they wo n't choose me . " She pets the toy dog on her desk . " Wan-chan , would you like to live in the Imperial Palace ? " The dog does n't move . A tangle of wires juts out of an open panel under its tail . " I 'll bet you could make the finals . Then you 'll at least get to meet the Prince , " Toshi says . " Do n't be discouraged so early . " " You 'd better spit out that chewing gum before you go , " Akira says , clicking his computer mouse . A bomb falls on Pearl Harbor , but misses its target . The computer groans . " The TV news said they 're expecting more than  | twenty thousand girls . I do n't have a chance . I just thought I 'd go and see . " " Why would you want to be princess ? " Nakamura looks up from the storyboards on his desk . " That Crown Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be better if you stay here and work hard . " " That 's right . I read that he studies catfish or something dumb like that , " Akira says . " At least you 'll wish me luck , wo n't you , Wan-chan . " She kisses the lifeless dog . " Bye-bye , everyone . " " Good luck , " Toshi says . She walks out the door . Akira shuts off his computer , and the Hawaiian Islands dissolve into darkness . " Her father lost his job . That 's why she wants to marry the Crown Prince . She 's afraid her family will end up out on the street . " " Really ? I did n't know . That 's terrible , " Toshi says . " Yes . He worked for Sony for thirty years . But they 're laying off thousands of people . It was on the morning news . " " Japan is becoming like America , " Toshi says . " Do n't worry . If people do n't have jobs to keep them busy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us . Is n't that right , Sensei ? " Akira says . Nakamura takes his cigarette out of his mouth , balances it on the rim of the ashtray , and lights another . He holds out his pack to Akira . " Fresh Air . New brand . Try one . "  | Akira takes a pack out of his shirt pocket , holds it up . " Happy , " he says , smiling . Nakamura gets up and puts his arm around the cardboard cutout Chocolate Girl . " Only you can save Japan , my dear . The country is collapsing like a brick house in an earthquake . We 've lost our spirit . Our Japanese soul . " " Sensei , do n't start on that again . " Akira puts on his Walkman earphones . Toshi remembers Jane 's letter , still unopened in his pants pocket . He left the house so quickly this morning , he did n't even change his clothes . He reaches into his pocket , feels his handkerchief damp with sweat , and his own warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces at work in Japan , and I am still trying to understand them . I must capture them on paper . " Nakamura takes Chocolate Girl into his arms and dances her around the room . " We 've become a country of hamburger eaters . Golf course pesticides poison our water supply and destroy our rice fields . Our military budget grows . Our corporations ravage the sacred rain forests of Borneo and pollute the rivers of Southeast Asia . Young Thai farm girls are enslaved in our hostess bars . " Toshi takes out the envelope and opens it . " The demons of Japan 's past continue to haunt us , " Nakamura shouts . Only a single sheet of paper . He unfolds it , and waves the smoke away .  | He stares at the message for a long time , reading it over and over again . This is what she 's going to do . She 's going to cut the skin off your thighs and line her coat with it , so she can feel you against her always . " Beware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toshi 's desk in a cloud of smoke . " We will pay for our mistakes . " PAUL ? " " In here . " Paul is sitting at the kitchen table in the dark . Toshi turns on the light , sits down , and watches him finish a box of cookies . " You 're going to get sick . " " Probably . It 's all part of the pattern . " " What ? " Paul still has on his suit and tie . His briefcase , the brown leather water stained , is lying on the gray linoleum by his chair . " Ueda is gone ? " He does n't really have to ask this question . Paul 's boyfriends always leave .  | " Gone . Along with about twenty CD 's , two videos , and my Issey Miyake sports coat . " Paul stuffs the last cookie in his mouth . " Not that I care about material things . " Toshi gets him a glass of water . " Please do n't eat so fast . " " At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adachi ? " " Which one was he ? " Paul has had so many boy-friends . " He took the woodblock print . " Paul gets up and searches the cupboards , opening one door after another . " Or was that Morioka ? Maybe Adachi is the one who took my leather jacket . No , that was that Doi . I think Adachi is the one who stole my Rolex . " He slams the cupboard doors in sequence . " I do n't understand it . I 'm so nice to them . I take them out to expensive restaurants . I buy them presents . I let them wear my clothes . " " College boys are too young , do n't you think ? They 're not trustworthy . " " You were trustworthy when you were in college . " Paul gets up and walks into the living room . Toshi follows . " Maybe you should try to meet older men ? " " Older than what ? " " Maybe you should try to meet nicer men ? " " I met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his side on the carpet , pulls his knees up to his chest , as if he  | is cold . He reminds Toshi of the homeless people who sleep in Shinjuku Station . He stands behind Paul and waits , listens to him breathe . Then , as Toshi knew he would , Paul reaches behind his back and pats the carpet . " Please , " he says quietly . The word rises up from him , a wisp broken off from the larger cloud of his body , which floats on the sky of gray carpet . " Please " hangs in the air , waiting for Toshi ' s reaction . And so he lies down behind Paul , puts his arm around his waist , and hugs him . " Thank you , " Paul whispers . When he starts to cry , Toshi tightens his hold and says over and over again , " It 's okay . It 's okay . " He tries to think about Paul but finds himself thinking instead about the feel of the carpet against his cheek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter from Jane in his pocket . He watches the minutes pass on the VCR clock . He listens to the traffic and to the rain . Paul stops crying . He says , " Well , why do n't I wash my face and we 'll go out and get very drunk ? " A pale man with wispy blond hair stops Toshi as they walk into the bar , holds him at arm 's length , and looks him up and down . " You are gorgeous . Would you go home with me tonight ? " " No , thank you , " Toshi says . These things happen to him when he goes to bars with Paul . He does n't  | mind . He enjoys being considered attractive , even by men . " My , and polite , too . Well , give me a call sometime . You wo n't be sorry . I make lots of money . " He hands him his business card and goes out the door . Paul grabs the card from him . " Morgan Stanley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tears up the card and drops it on the floor . " What do you want to drink ? I 'm having vodka . " They take two seats at the end of the bar so Paul can watch the door , check out who 's coming in . It is only ten o'clock . It wo n't start getting crowded for another hour . Toshi takes Jane 's letter out of his pocket , unfolds it on the bar . Paul stares at the sheet of paper . " Whoa . This is incredible . This is not funny . Voodoo weird . Were her other letters this spooky ? " He repeats what Lucy told him , about Jane 's affair with her ikebana teacher . " Why did n't you tell me before ? " He looks hurt . He never likes to be left out of anything in Toshi ' s life . " I do n't know . I guess I should have . " But he does know . He did n't tell Paul because he did n't want to admit that the letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tell him that ? " Look , this woman is obviously nuts . " " Nuts ? " Peanuts . Walnuts . Mami once brought Toshi  | a box of chocolate-covered macadamia nuts from Hawaii . " Certifiable . Wacko . Crazy . And she may be taking drugs . Which means that she also may be dangerous . " They finish their vodkas and order another round . " I have to go see her . " " You have to what ? " " I have to go see her . " Paul often asks him to repeat things . When they first met , Toshi mistook this for bad hearing , not emphasis . Now he knows : A request for repetition means Paul is either annoyed or delighted . " I have to find out what she wants . " " You 're not going to find out because you 're not going to contact her . She 's too , too crazy . Even for me . " He leans in toward Toshi and lowers his voice . " Which brings me to a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? " " What kind of sex did you two have ? I mean , she sounds very bizarre . " Toshi feels the blood rush to his face . " Oh , my God . I ca n't believe I 'm embarrassing you . Was it that wild ? Was there apparatus involved ? Blood rituals ? Sacrificial animals ? What ? Tell me . I want details . " " It was normal sex , " he says . And it 's almost true . Paul looks disappointed . The bartender brings over their drinks , and he pays for them , then drinks his  | down fast like medicine . He raises two fingers . The bartender nods . " One more question . " " Yes ? " Paul turns and stares at him , frowning slightly . " Was it safe sex ? " " Yes , it was safe , " Toshi says , relieved that he can answer him truthfully . He knows what Paul means by " safe , " for Paul constantly lectures him , passes along articles and pamphlets on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Jane is , even she had been cautious . " Well , thank goodness for that . At least I 've taught you something . Excuse me , it 's pee time . " Paul gets up and walks across the room to the toilet , closes the door behind him , leaving Toshi alone with two full glasses on white square napkins . Vodka on ice . He picks up one of the glasses , swirls the ice cubes around . And he waits : For Paul to return . For Jane to hurt him or not to hurt him . He watches the ice cubes rearrange themselves in the glass , as if he might read them like tea leaves . He waits for a future he ca n't imagine . " You must be an actor . Am I right ? Tell me I 'm right . " " I beg your pardon ? " He turns and tries to focus on the man sitting next to him . Paul still has n't returned from the toilet , and  | the bar is filling up . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the bathroom door . Madonna is singing . In the center of the room , a gigantic flower arrangement , long , prickly limbs around which everyone moves cautiously , cigarettes and sweaty drinks held close to their chests like fragile objects . " I said , You must be an actor . I 've seen you , have n't I ? In that ashtray commercial , the one that sucks up smoke ? You 're the husband , right ? Wait . No , it 's the one for breath mints . That 's it . " The man has a face like a frog . Toshi , drunk , imagines that he 's a tree frog , escaped from the branches in the center of the room . " No . Not an actor . " He does n't want to talk to anybody . He finishes his drink , then picks up Paul 's glass . Cubes of ice almost gone , water into vodka . The frog turns away . Toshi thinks he is rid of him , but it is not that easy . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies ? " Toshi nods . " Yes . I like movies very much . " He is having a hard time speaking in English . Too much to drink . Maybe it would be nice to talk about movies though , about something simple , something that has nothing to do with his life . " I knew it . I adore movies . I spent my entire childhood in movie theaters . " The frog waits , but Toshi does n't respond . So he continues .  | " Ozu is my absolute favorite director . So pure , do n't you think ? " " I 've never seen an Ozu film , " he says . He 's had this conversation before with other foreigners . Everything foreigners like about Japan was already over before Toshi was born . " Never seen Ozu ? " The frog is incredulous . " You mean to tell me you 've never seen Tokyo Story ? " He nods , then shakes his head . He always forgets : Yes sometimes means no in English . Across the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . Making his way back , he ducks thorny branches , nods to acquaintances , absently brushes away cigarette smoke , and searches every face . Paul is always looking  --  for a boyfriend , for other things . " Well , if you have n't , you should , " the frog says . " After all , you 're Japanese . And it 's one of the ten greatest movies ever made . " Toshi is about to ask him what the other nine are when Paul sits down and looks at the two empty glasses . " I should have known I could n't trust you alone with my drink . " " Are you two together ? " The frog leans forward , speaks across him to Paul . " I was n't trying to pick up your boyfriend . " " That 's okay . He 's not my boyfriend . " Paul signals the bartender for two more drinks .  | " Really ? " The frog looks Toshi over . " Well . Then , maybe I was trying to pick him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toshi says . " No , no , of course you 're not . Heaven forbid . Neither am I. Nobody here is , " the frog says . The drinks arrive . " Please , let me get these , " he says , leaning back to take his wallet from his pocket . But he leans back too far , and his stool tips over . " Look out ! " Paul yells . Toshi watches the frog fall in a slow , surprised descent , right into the arms of two women  --  one blond , one brunette  --  in rugby shirts . " Gotcha . " The blond laughs . And they raise his chair , with him still in it , as if they are lifting a piece of furniture into place . " Why , thank you . Thank you , " he says . His face is scarlet . His hand goes to his chest and flutters there , illustrating , perhaps , the movement of his heart . " You two girls are wonders . I believe you just saved my life ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Well , let me at least buy you a round of drinks . I insist . " He turns to Toshi . " And another round for you and your friend ? " " Actually , we were about to leave . I have n't had my dinner yet . " Paul stands up . " Ready ? " he says to Toshi , who is still replaying the frog 's fall in his head : The slow-motion descent , as if he were moving through water . Toshi saw the confusion in his eyes as the poi-  | ished surface of the bar , the rows of liquor bottles , the mirrored wall , all passed by . And the way he rose effortlessly back up , like a film run in reverse . Could Toshi move backward through time like that , and wipe out his mistakes ? The rainy season . On the TV weather maps , heavy clouds cover the Japanese archipelago from Okinawa all the way up to northern Honshu . Only Hokkaido is clear . On Shiretoko Peninsula , laundry is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark wind . Here in Tokyo 's gay bar district , though , neon signs are stacked one on top of another four stories high , and their bright colors bleed together in the rain like watercolors . Toshi and Paul walk past Marine Club , Kings of College , 69 , Zip , Morning Tissue , Idol Host Snack Bar . Rain swirls around them like vapor . An umbrella , even if they had one , would offer no protection . Paul is ahead of him , walking quickly . " Thanks , " he says to Paul 's wet back . " I did n't want to talk to him . " " I did n't do it just for you . I really am hungry . " He stops and turns around . They are both drunk . " Promise me , " Paul says . " Promise you ? " " That you 'll be careful . " " I 'll be careful . " He does n't know what Paul means , but he 's happy to repeat whatever he says . " I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scary note she wrote . I mean , who knows what she might do . " Paul glances quickly behind him . " She could be stalking you . She might be watching us right now . " " Watching us ? " Toshi freezes . Is she really here ? Around them , everything is wet and moves in bursts , the speed of objects described by the rain . Sounds : hissing , snapping , splashing . Taxis , bicycles , clusters of umbrellas . A red paper lantern sways in front of a food ven-dor 's stall . " Hey , do n't worry . If you were born to be shot , you wo n't be hung . " Paul smiles and slaps him on the shoulder . " What ? " Is Paul not making any sense , or is Toshi just too drunk to understand him ? " Let 's go eat . " Paul crosses the street , his expensive loafers splashing through puddles . Toshi follows him , grateful to Paul for caring about him . A taxi comes between them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tight black dress steps out and opens a Snoopy umbrella . Toshi recognizes her . " Lucy ! " The taxi door swings shut . She looks up , startled . The taxi pulls away , and they 're both left standing in the middle of the street . Paul is on the opposite curb . p 161 " Toshi ! Oh my God , I was n't supposed to see anyone I know with this umbrella . It 's not mine . You must n't think that it 's mine . " She laughs , closes up the umbrella , and hides it behind her back , then opens it again . She takes a step forward , so that it covers Toshi too . " This is n't doing a bit of good , is it ? Look , it 's raining from the ground up . " She laughs , and closes the umbrella for a second time . " I ca n't believe I 'm carrying a Snoopy umbrella and I run into you . I never , ever , run into anybody in Tokyo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she 's talking fast . She looks so beautiful . He 's never imagined her in a black dress . But he has imagined her , many times . Tonight the rain settles on her bare skin like drops of fresh cooking oil . " I 'm on my way to hear some jazz . The club is somewhere around here . I have a map . Would you like to come along ? " She looks at him suspiciously . " Are you drunk ? Oh , God , you 're drunk , are n't you . " He grins . " I 'm with my friend . He 's right there . " He points to Paul , who waves , then crosses the street to them . The three of them stand in the rain . Cars swerve around them . " This is my friend Paul . This is my friend Lucy . " Seeing the two of them together , these two separate parts of his life , sobers him up slightly . " So , you 're the famous Lucy . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amused . " I love your umbrella , " Paul says . Charming .  | " God , I knew this would happen . You must think I 'm a complete dork . I swear , it 's not mine , " she says , flirting with Paul . He 's handsome , the red hair . " Of course it is n't . But your fashion sense is none of my business , " Paul says . They step up onto the sidewalk and start walking , forgetting Toshi . He does n't mind . He 's relieved . They like each other . " We were just going to get something to eat . Why do n't you come with us ? " Paul asks . " Sure . I 'd love to . " She looks back over her shoulder without slowing down . " Is this the friend you 've been staying with ? He 's nice . " " Yes , " he says , hurrying to catch up . But can he ever catch up ? They walk too fast , they talk too fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time they meet , are able to just start talking , amazes and discourages him . Will he ever be that sure of himself ? They duck into a small ramen shop , the first open doorway they come upon in the rain . An orange Formica counter with five stools , bare fluorescent tubes , a worn concrete floor . Toshi sits down and , out of habit , lines up the sticky jars of rice vinegar , chili oil , and soy sauce on the counter in front of him . Toshi was born into an atmosphere heavy with molecules of ramen broth . In his earliest memories , his father stirs the broth in a huge pot on the stove . He throws in fatty chunks of pork . Before she left them , his mother p 163 made noodles by hand , by window light , lifting the dough over and over again like the hem of her apron . A tired-looking man behind the counter watches TV and waits for customers . Like Toshi 's father . He pours glasses of water , then takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of noodles in the palm of his hand before dropping it into the boiling water . The hiss of the rain is on Toshi 's right , Lucy and Paul on his left . He only half-listens to their conversation as the cook takes three white bowls from a tall stack , lines them up , and spoons in the sauce . He 's heard it before : Where they 're from . When they came to Tokyo . Why . But then there are details , events from Lucy 's past he has n't heard . She is twenty-eight years old . She spent three months living in a Zen temple in Kamakura when she first came to Japan . She swept the floors , practiced zazen , and learned to play the shakuhachi flute . She laughs . " I was awful at all of it , except the shakuhachi . I almost ruined my back and knees meditating . I was practically crippled . " The cook shakes out the noodles , runs them under tap water . " But why did you come back to Japan ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each bowl with a smooth , practiced motion of his arm . " Back in America , I fell in love . My lover and I  | moved in together . We were in love , then my lover died . " " Oh , God , " Lucy says . Toshi is startled . This is a story Paul never told him . The cook ladles in the broth . Working fast with chopsticks , he adds thin slices of pork and chopped green onions . " Yes . My lover got sick . Every day for a year I watched him die . Then he died . And I fled . Back to Japan . " On top of each bowl , the cook floats a crisp square of nori . The seaweed darkens , green to black , as it absorbs the broth . " I 'm so , so sorry , " Lucy says , and she takes Paul 's hand . Toshi is numb . He can feel that he has stopped breathing , but he does n't know how to start again . The cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Be careful . They 're hot . " " Well , " Paul says , taking his bowl . " You know . These days , it 's become an old story , has n't it ? " " No . No , it has n't . Do n't say that . It will never be an old story . " Toshi is humiliated . Paul just met Lucy ten minutes before . Why did n't Paul ever tell him ? He does n't want to listen anymore . He concentrates on the white bowl in front of him . As the fragrant and familiar steam wets his face , his eyes fill with tears of anger , clouding his vision . In one hand he finds his chopsticks , in the other  | a plastic spoon . How did they get there ? In the bowl , the white sky over Shiretoko Peninsula . Heavy clouds blow in from the sea and collide . He is hurt and angry and ca n't distinguish between longing and memory . Who is he angry at ? he wonders , panicking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A father who chopped vegetables , fried up rice , weighed out servings of noodles in the palm of his hand day after day without ever speaking , without revealing anything ? Why does n't anyone ever tell him the most important things ? Is it his fault ? He lowers his chopsticks , and his hand grazes the rim of the bowl , tipping it over . He watches as the scalding broth and noodles spill in slow motion into his lap . Lucy and Paul and the cook all look up when he cries out . For a moment , even he confuses the source of the pain . They 're standing in the rain . Lucy opens her Snoopy umbrella . " Thank you . This was so great , " she says to Paul . " Listen , you saved our evening , " he says . " You and your wonderful umbrella . " They kiss like old friends , like Americans . She turns to Toshi , hesitates , then smiles . " Are you all right ? Are you sure you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , and he looks down at his pants , wet from the waist all the way to the cuffs . Paul poured glasses of water over him .  | " Well , I 'll call you as soon as I have a finished tape for you to listen to . But send me your drawings , okay ? " Angry , he only nods . She waves , disappears around a corner . " We 'll never get a taxi now . We 'll have to take the train , " Paul says , maybe noticing Toshi 's sullenness , maybe not . He 's drunk too . Inside the subway station , the homeless , in their government-issue blue uniforms , bed down for the night on rows of identical mats . He considers joining them . He does n't have a home now , he realizes . Paul 's home is not his . Paul walks up to a ticket machine . " Two tickets to Aoyama Icchome , " he says in Japanese . " Welcome . Please deposit two hundred and eighty yen , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was the exact amount needed . You will change trains at Akasaka Mitsuke Station . Thank you , " the machine says , churning out two tickets . " You 're welcome , " Toshi says , feeling that he has more in common with the ticket dispenser , which is , after all , Japanese . He slides his ticket into the turnstile slot , then sticks his arms into the blood pressure checker . The rubber cylinder tightens , grips him , then releases with a hiss . " One-ten over seventy . Work hard tomorrow , " the machine says in a pleasant voice .  | IF I WERE STRAIGHT , YOUR FRIEND LUCY IS EXACTLY the kind of woman I 'd go for . " Paul comes into the room , carrying a glass of water . It 's morning . Toshi sits up in bed . He has a terrible hangover . Paul drops two white tablets into the glass and hands it to him . " Wait until it stops fizzing , then drink it . An American cure . It works wonders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boyfriend who died ? " Toshi has been thinking about this since he woke up . Last night , he fell into a restless sleep thinking about it , imagining the boyfriend . Who was he ? What did he look like ? Imagining Paul sad , alone on an airplane to Japan . Paul ignores him , seats himself on the edge of the bed , and arranges the hem of his bathrobe around himself like a skirt . " You think I 'd make a good princess ? Perhaps I should have gone to the audition . " Toshi does n't laugh . " You just met her . You do n't even know her . "  | " She 's American , " Paul says . " Drink your AlkaSeltzer like a good boy . It 's stopped fizzing . " He drinks it . It tastes terrible . Paul takes the glass from him . " I do n't know why I always listen to you , " Toshi says . He waits for the drink to take effect , to soothe his anger as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older and white . It 's been that way since the beginning of time . " This morning , he is impatient with Paul 's jokes . " You could have told me . I thought I was your best friend . You told Lucy things about you that I never knew . " " I was very drunk . She was someone I would have been friends with back home . It was like I knew her already . " Paul gets up off the bed . " I 'm late for work . " He pauses in the doorway . " You 're Japanese . I guess I did n't think you 'd understand . And besides . . . " He stops . " Besides what ? " " Besides , " he continues as he walks down the hall , " I 've always been in love with you . That makes it difficult to talk to you about certain things . " Later , when Paul is in the shower , Toshi goes into his bedroom and opens the dresser drawers . He does n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let-  | ters ? I do n't know Paul , he thinks . I thought I did , but I do n't , not at all . What else do n't I know about him ? He does n't find anything . He leaves the drawers open and goes down the hall . He stands outside the open bathroom door and says , " I 'm going to move back to my apartment . I do n't think I should stay here . Okay ? " Paul does n't say anything . " Did you hear me ? " Paul shuts the shower off . The murmur of the exhaust fan . Water dripping from the showerhead . In the kitchen , the radio is on . " I heard you , " Paul says . And then he turns the shower back on . IT HAS BEEN RAINING FOR DAYS . THE SNAPSHOTS ON HIS wall and the pages of comic books scattered on the tatami curl up like waves . Exhausted and discouraged , Toshi leans into the wall for a moment , and leaves a damp handprint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peninsula , an hour 's hike from the noodle shop . The walls of the cave were covered with phosphorescent moss . Toshi leaned his whole body into it , and when he walked away he left his shadow behind .  | He 's surprised that there are no red envelopes waiting for him . He turns his answering machine back on , vaguely hopeful . Could Jane possibly have given up , as worn out by her own persistence as he is ? And what about Lucy , who has stepped into his life unexpectedly , stepping awkwardly between him and Paul ? His clothes and skin reek of cigarette smoke . Gathering up soap , shampoo , a towel , and his orange plastic basin , he walks past the 7-Eleven and the video store , his bare feet wet , sliding in and out of his rubber sandals . Rainwater rushes along the curb , tossing cigarette butts . He looks up through his clear plastic umbrella at the dark , wet sky . Apartment building lights twinkle like stars  --  the only stars he ever sees in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stool and stares at himself in the mirror . Mount Fuji , a mosaic of bath tiles , rises up in front of him to the wooden ceiling . He lets the faucet run until the hot water overflows his basin . All around him , naked men vigorously scrub their bodies with rough washcloths , shampoo their hair , rub pumice stones on the bottoms of their feet . They pull their razors across their wet cheeks , flicking the shaving cream onto the floor . Rows of faucets and showerheads gush water . So much water seems a luxury , even with the constant rain . He feels the hot vapor opening his pores , and the anxiety seeps out of him . Toshi rinses off , then lowers himself into the vast tub , and he feels real heat  --  heat that aches , that enters p 171 his bones . Conjuring heat : His mother climbs the stairs after her bath , her pretty face flushed , her hair wrapped in a towel , a glass of cold tea in her hand . His first night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bath surrounded by unfamiliar faces , everyone too shy to speak , only nodding at one another . Toshi feels himself dissolve . He closes his eyes and he sees volcanic hot springs . Steam rises up over Japan and envelops the whole country in a cloud of sulphur . Women 's voices drift over the low dividing wall of the bathhouse . A mother warns her daughter to be careful stepping into the tub . He hears a splash and opens his eyes . A bald , old man slides into the tub next to him . " Ah , it feels good , " he sighs , nodding to Toshi . " Yes , it does , " he says . " Are you a college student ? " " No , I work . " " But you 're not from Tokyo . I can tell from your accent . " " I 'm from Hokkaido . " " That 's a good place . Clean air . Lots of trees . " The man nods again , then settles his shiny , wrinkled head back against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can sit naked together in the same tub even though we 're strangers , Toshi thinks . That 's because we 're Japanese . We understand each other . We trust each other . He is tired of Americans , of trying to know them . He feels devoured by them . Even Paul . Paul is in love with him . He knew that . He realizes now that  | he 's always known it . But why did Paul have to spoil everything and say it aloud ? He closes his eyes again , surrenders again to the heat , and he sees Hokkaido . The flickering green light of the soft pines . The curling bark of the white birch . The sound of the forest when there is no wind . The shadow of a small boy imprinted on a wall of luminous moss . He shuts the balcony doors and turns on the air conditioner . Then he takes out his sketch pad and begins to draw . He is bored with Chocolate Girl . There are so many things he wants to draw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in August . He 's twelve , maybe thirteen years old . Lying on the dock at midnight , he searches the sky for shooting stars . Underneath him , the soothing sound of the sea . Above him , stars burn across the blackness like everything he desires . Still sitting up , his sketchbook open in front of him , Toshi sleeps and dreams . His hand unfolds , and his pencil rolls across the table , drops onto the floor of the noodle shop . The shop is filled with customers . Behind the counter , his father works quickly , frying rice in the big wok . The room fills with oily smoke . His mother carries trays of steaming ramen bowls . Everyone Toshi knows is there . Paul and Jane and Lucy . The fishermen . Nakamura and Mami and Akira . And everyone is smoking cigarettes . Toshi starts to cough . Suddenly , he p 173 finds himself in a huge garage with Audrey Hepburn . She runs from car to car , turning on the engines . The windows are closed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't breathe . He wakes up . His throat and lungs ache . The apartment is filled with smoke . He opens the balcony doors , gasps for air , and watches the smoke rush out into the hot , wet darkness . Neon lights flicker all across the city like rooftop campfires . Inside his apartment , small flames crackle by the front door . The tatami is on fire . Cockroaches stream out from behind his kitchen cabinets and dash up the walls . He grabs the kettle and pours water over the small flames , which sizzle and die . He stands there naked , his heart pounding hard , his skin dripping smoke and sweat . The tatami smells like roasted tea . Someone bangs on his door . " Okamoto-san ! Okamoto-san ! Are you in there ? Wake up ! " He opens the door . Cockroaches swarm over his bare feet and out into the hallway . His next-door neighbor stands there in his summer long underwear , looking terrified . " Oh , thank goodness . I was so frightened . I called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He hears sirens . Then he smells something else , stronger than tea . A wad of newspaper lies below the mail slot , smoldering . He picks it up . It 's the Japan Times , the English-language daily . It 's heavy , soaked with liquid . His neighbor leans over and sniffs it .  | " Kerosene . It looks like someone tried to burn down your apartment . " The firemen arrive , and then the police . Rainwater drips from their shiny slickers , forms small puddles in the corridor that reflect the fluorescent lights . A TV reporter appears with a cameraman , and bright light bounces off the walls , draining the night of any remaining color . Bare-chested and in his boxer shorts , Toshi shields his eyes , confused by the commotion . The elevator door opens and closes , disgorges strangers . The policemen pass the balled-up newspaper back and forth like a pork-stuffed bun while his next-door neighbor tells them about the foreign woman he saw banging on Toshi ' s door . " It was a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigners at all , never even talked to one in my life , but for some reason , I thought she looked very upset . " On the edge of the small crowd , the words foreigner and arson are taken up , woven into the texture of the night . The TV reporter holds a microphone up to Toshi . " I do n't know anything about it . Probably she had the wrong apartment . I do n't read the Japan Times . It 's an English newspaper . " " We 've been having problems with foreigners here in Tokyo , you know . A foreigner crime wave , " one of the policemen says . p 175 " Foreigner crime wave ? " The newspaper reporter scribbles on his pad . The policeman puts the kerosene-soaked newspaper in a shiny metallic bag and zips it up . At dawn , Toshi 's landlord arrives , walks through the apartment , and scowls . " I 'm not replacing the tatami . I 'll send someone up to turn them later this week . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disturbed in the middle of the night . " " I do n't like my tenants mixed up with foreigners . It only causes trouble for everybody . " " I apologize . I 'm sure it was a case of mistaken identity . From now on , I 'll be careful . " He bows deeply . But he wonders if his landlord might be right , if getting involved with foreigners will inevitably lead to trouble . And he also wonders : If it is too late to be careful . Hours later , when he has finished cleaning up the apartment as best he can and is ready to take a nap , the phone rings . Jane . He knows he has to answer it . He has to talk to her . He lifts the receiver . " Hello ? " " Good morning , " his mother says in a cheerful voice . " I hope I did n't wake you . " He does n't tell her . It would be impossible to explain to her the turn his life has taken here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know your father is coming to visit you . " " Really ? When ? " His father never left Hokkaido , rarely left the shop . " I think he 's on his way already . " " Why is he coming ? He did n't even call to tell me . " " He did n't say . Only that he 's driving down to Hakodate and then taking the ferry . I told him that it 's such a long trip that way , but he said he did n't want to fly , and that he had plenty of time . " She pauses . " He 's been acting odd lately . " " What do you mean ? " " I do n't really know . He 's been calling a lot , and wanting to talk . I think he 's lonely . " " Is everything all right ? " " Everything 's fine . But please be kind to him . He 's getting old , you know . " " Do n't worry . I 'll take good care of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sixty-five . So he would be ... seventy-two . " " He 'll stay with me , wo n't he ? " " I suppose . He did n't say . He just called and said , ' I 'm going to visit Toshi-chan in Tokyo . ' You know how your father is . " " Yes , " Toshi said . But , really , he did n't know .  | IN THE EARLY SPRING , TOSHI GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE . He packed up his room , shipped his art books and supplies to Paul 's apartment in Tokyo , said good-bye to his friends and teachers , and left Sapporo . His girlfriend , Patty Shapiro , had already returned to America , back to her American boyfriend . As he carried his duffel bag and suitcase through the bitter cold to the train station , the city seemed abandoned , his emotional attachments already severed . He traveled up to Shiretoko Peninsula , changing trains at small , snow-swept stations , and moving northeast through familiar vistas . Billowing sulphur clouds hung motionless over hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race . The skiers , in sheens of bright pink and green , their heads bowed and their numbers pinned on their backs , moved purposefully , rolling across the white hills like colorful beads . His mother waited for him in front of the train station in Shari . Behind the steering wheel of Taro 's car , she sipped a steaming cup of Mr. Donut coffee .  | Each time he saw his mother , he was confounded by the person she was still becoming . His father grew even more silent each year , shedding words like weight . But his mother , in the years since she 'd left them , had become talkative , frequently cheerful . Sometimes he found himself resenting her . Had he and his father really made her so unhappy ? Even her appearance : At the noodle shop , each morning she 'd pulled her hair back into a tight bun . But after she 'd moved to the inn , Taro teased her , called her " Auntie , " until she loosened her hair and let it fall into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd untied the ponytail too . Now her thick hair , streaked with white , hung down her back . Her clothes were loose and plain , and as always hid the shape of her body . In the past few years , though , she often added something small and beautiful . Today , a man 's sweater and pants , a down jacket . Silver wagon wheels with turquoise spokes swung tentatively from her ears . Taro liked to entertain the inn 's guests by telling them that he was descended from the Ainu , the aboriginal tribe that had once inhabited Hokkaido . One night , after drinking two flasks of sake , Taro had pointed at Toshi 's mother and said to a group of young backpackers from Tokyo , " This woman here is pure Ainu . Ca n't you tell by looking at her ? " She laughed at him as she served up a dinner of fish stew and mountain root vegetables . " It 's true , " she said . " We Ainu have very thick hair , like animal fur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground . She wove fox bones and birds ' feathers through it . " The young guests stared up at her in wonder . Toshi looked at her with both astonishment and unexpected anger . She flushed at her own lie and hurried from the room . He 'd never known she was capable of lies . Yet she 'd told one as quickly and easily as she told the truth , as if they were the same thing . He could n't help but think , What else has she lied about ? What do n't I know about my mother ? They drove out of the drab town past frozen fields , rippling dark sheets that dipped down to the coast road . " The inn is doing well ? " " This is the busiest winter ever . People ca n't afford to go abroad now , so they come up here to see the ice floes . Wait until you see the changes Taro 's made . You know , he hired a Filipino girl . " " Really ? " " It 's hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inn these days . They all want to move to the city and work in offices . He found her through an employment agency . She 's very nice and hardworking . " They drove without talking for a while . Gusts of wind splattered pebbles against the windshield like rain . " Your father and I were divorced last month . "  | A strange numbness spread out abruptly from Toshi 's chest into his limbs . Blood pounded behind his eyes . He stared straight ahead . " Did you think we already were ? " Her voice sounded dry , unfamiliar . She was a stranger to him . " I did n't know . " On Shiretoko Peninsula , people married young , had children right away . Toshi 's mother was forty-two when he was born , his father forty-eight , old as grandparents . He 'd never asked why they 'd waited , or about the years before he was born . And after she left , nothing was ever said about their separation . Now , suddenly , his mother wanted to talk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years of silence . " I asked for the divorce . Not your father . Please do n't blame him . " Toshi was angry . " Why did you have to do it ? You could have stayed married . " Even as the words tumbled out , he realized his foolishness . In his mind , they had remained together . But it had been fourteen years since she left . " We could n't have stayed married , " she said . " Why not ? " She did n't answer him . The road narrowed as the foothills pressed closer to the sea . The mountains were solid white , the snow so deep that the treetops were only brief shadows on its surface . " When the thaw comes , there 'll be so much water  | pouring down to the sea . We 'll be digging out of the mud until late May , " she said . He would help her , give her time to say what she had to say . " The streams and lakes will be high all summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mosquitoes . " And in the early morning hours , flocks of butterflies , he thought . Purple Emperors fluttering down from the treetops like startling dreams . " Toshi-chan , you like Taro , do n't you ? " " Yes " was all he said , still distracted . Taro 's wife had died young  --  from cancer , Granny once told him . He 'd quit his company job , moved up to Hokkaido . He 'd never remarried , and he had no children . He 'd taken Toshi fishing , had taught him how to salvage driftwood and build a shed from it . She slowed the car , as if it was difficult for her to concentrate on what she wanted to say . " Taro and I are going to be married . " He was so taken by surprise that he could n't say anything , even thought he knew she was waiting . When he finally said , " Mother , congratulations , " the words were automatic , simply good manners . " Then it 's all right with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wanted his approval . " Yes . Taro is a good man . " It was true . He knew that for her , this was good news .  | " Thank you . Of course , I was worried about what you would think . " The words spilled out . " Why ? Why were you worried ? You never worried before . You always just do as you please , do n't you ? " She pulled sharply onto the shoulder of the road and stopped the car . She stared straight ahead . " Do you think your mother has been happy ? " She sounded as if she was going to cry . Already he was sorry he had spoken so harshly . " Please forgive me , " he said , bowing his head . " You do n't know the truth . Someday I 'll tell you . " He raised his eyes , but she turned away and stared out the window . " Truth ? What truth ? " What truth was she talking about ? Why she left them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he raised his voice . " I ca n't . I ca n't . " She wiped her eyes on her sleeve and took a deep breath , composing herself . She pressed down on the gas pedal and slowly guided the car back onto the road . He stared at his lap , still thinking , The truth ? What does that word mean to them and to their lives ? As they neared Rausu , he spoke again . " Does Father know ? About the marriage ? " " Of course . I told him right away . " That was all she said . He did n't ask any more questions . He knew his silent father , the way he only nod-  | ded his head at all news , good or bad . He felt sorry for him , alone in his noodle shop at the end of the road . When he closed the shop at eight each night , there was no one there . First his wife had left him , then his son . Now his wife was marrying another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strong wind pressed them back toward shore . Taro took them out to a restaurant on the coast road that night . If his mother had told him about their conversation in the car , he did n't let on . He was in a celebratory mood . He ordered hot sake , and they held up their cups in a toast . " It 's taken me a long time to convince your mother to marry me . I finally told her that if she did n't say yes , I was going to find some other pretty young girl who would . " He reached out his arm to pull her to him , but she leaned slightly away . Taro laughed and moved closer . " I finally got her , and now I 'm not letting her go . " She shook her head . " What a silly man I 'm going to marry , " she said . She was flustered by Taro 's attention . Toshi saw her face color and he turned away . They were all silent for a while as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please do n't blame your mother . It was my idea . We just want a chance to be happy together . " " I understand , " Toshi said . And he did . For this was  | something he 'd always wanted for his mother too , for as long as he could remember : happiness . The bus and Mr. Goto had gotten old together . The leather seats and the skin on the driver 's face seemed to have sagged and settled into a similar pattern of folds and creases . Toshi opened his window to clear the cigarette smoke as the bus climbed up the mountain in fits and starts , wheezing on the sharp turns . " So , you 've finally come back home , Toshi-chan , have you ? Going to help your father out ? " " Actually , I 'm just visiting . I 'm moving to Tokyo , " he said . " Tokyo ? Is that so ? Tokyo 's really a big city . Too crowded for me . I was there once , just after the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? " " Of course he does . I 'm just here to visit , " he repeated . " Is that so ? " Mr. Goto did n't say anything else , just puffed on his cigarette and stared out at the road , as if driving took more of his concentration than it used to . The parking lot on top of the ridge had n't changed , except for the addition of three coin-operated binoculars . Mr. Goto pulled in and stopped the bus , threw his cigarette out the window , and lit a new one . " Your father 's not such a young man anymore . " " Yes , that 's true . " p 185 " I guess it gets pretty lonely , all by himself out there at the end of the road . " " Yes , it must . " Did he know about his mother and Taro ? Of course he . did . Everyone here knew everything about everyone . What had his father endured all these years since his other left ? For Toshi , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teachers , the taunting of classmates , cruel marks about his mother overheard in shops . All that had eventually stopped . And then Toshi left . Had it ever stopped for his father ? Mr. Goto steered the bus out of the lot . Below them , a hawk rode the air currents , followed the contours of the mountain . " Well , I guess none of us are getting any younger , is n't that so ? " the bus driver said , and he started to cough . He pushed open his window , cleared his throat , and spit . is father stood next to his polished white car at the Rausu bus stop , smoking a cigarette . Behind him , the frozen sea heaved and shuddered . Yellow clouds rushed across the horizon to spread a blanket over the sleepy Russian islands . " Welcome back , " he said . He was n't wearing his apron . Toshi bowed . " Thank you for coming to pick me up . Are you well , Father ? "  | He nodded . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the road toward the ridge . " I thought we 'd go to the hot spring pools above the falls . " " What about the shop ? " " I do n't open for lunch in the winter anymore . It 's too much effort just for the few customers who show up . I make most of my money off the summer tourists . You 'd be surprised how many we get these days . " " What do you do all day ? " His father did n't answer . It was n't a personal question , but it was the kind of question he had never asked . How did his father feel about his mother marrying Taro ? He could never ask him that . He knew they would never discuss it . The air was so dry he thought he could hear the clouds pass overhead . Dead leaves that had held on through the winter rattled on their branches like abandoned musical instruments . They undressed shyly , facing away from each other , folding their clothes on a dry , flat stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Deer , foxes , and people . Toshi shivered . He covered his genitals with his hands and stepped quickly into the water . Aware of his own youth , he was shocked at how old his father had become . His pale skin hung on his frame like loose cloth , and his cropped hair had turned gray . " Aaah , it feels so good , " his father said , closing his p 187 eyes as he lowered himself slowly into the pool . He listed like a fishing boat taking on water . Bubbles rose up around him and burst , releasing the strong smell of sulphur . They sat for a long time without talking , looking at the winter woods : vertical lines , bare tree trunks , blanks waiting to be filled in when the spring came . Like one of Toshi 's sketches  --  after the pencil , before the colors . " So , you 're going to Tokyo to live , " his father said finally . It was n't a question . " Yes . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " " You 'll be okay by yourself , Father ? Running the shop ? " " No need to worry about me , " he said . " You know people there ? " " My friend Paul . The American . You remember him ? " " Ah , yes . The foreigner . " They were quiet again for a few minutes . Birches creaked and knocked against neighboring pines . Melting snow fell from branches in great clumps , thumping through the forest like footsteps . His father said , " It 's important to know people in a big city like Tokyo . " " Yes . " That was the end of their conversation . It occurred to him that he might not see his father  | again for a long time . There were things he wanted to ask him , to say to him about their life together , all those silent years in the two rooms above the noodle shop . And about his mother . But it was too late for that , he understood . Too late for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born . He recalled his mother 's words in the car . Did his father also know the truth ? He looked at him , a silent old man across the small pool . And it was like looking at him from across the sea . Toshi was on a ship , moving farther and farther away . LINED UP IN FRONT OF EVERY DOORWAY , UMBRELLAS and bicycles clutter the narrow lane to Jane 's apartment . Windows open and close , room lights are switched on and off . Water drips from drainpipes and air conditioners . Someone is practicing scales on a piano , and the musical notes leap out into the darkness like shafts of light . Hemmed in by newer , higher apartment blocks , Jane 's building hunches over , its wet tile roof sagging . Toshi stands in front of her door , hesitates , almost turns back , but then remembers : the tatami burning .  | He knocks . He hears footsteps , the doorknob turns , and his heart starts to beat fast . He takes a deep breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , brushes her hair out of her eyes with the other . Her face is puffy and flushed , and her skin radiates a heat he can feel . He is startled by her nearness , so much so that he forgets both his fear and his anger . " Yes ? What do you want ? " she says , her face blank , impatient , as if he is a stranger . Does n't she recognize him ? Maybe he should have called first . But he did n't trust her . Prepared , what she might have done . She loosens her grip on her robe and it slips open . A glimpse of her pale breasts , and then the green robe covers her again , like a wave rolling up onshore . Toshi is aroused , and dismayed by his excitement . " I 'm Toshi . " " I know who you are , " she says , her voice too loud . " Do you think something 's wrong with me ? Why are you here ? " She is agitated , already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , inside the apartment , a red lightbulb flickers . " Well ? " " I wanted to talk to you , " he says , suddenly angry . " About the fire . " He is sure he sees it : A slight tremor runs across her face , just below the skin .  | " Fire . What fire ? You should have called first . " She laughs . " I would have told you not to come . " " Jane ? " A young Japanese man , naked except for his undershorts , stumbles to the door . He looks dazed . Drunk . His lips are swollen , and there are bruises on his chest . Toshi turns and walks away . The door slams shut behind him . At the end of the lane , he stoops slightly to pass under a cluster of dripping hydrangea , and he realizes that he is holding his breath . He lets it out and inhales hot , damp air , the scent of wet leaves and soil . Night flowers bloom a pallid blue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp , he stops to watch a motorcycle swing around the corner . Sheathed in a helmet and leather jumper , the rider looks like a human projectile , an acrobat who could turn somersaults in the air . The bike skids on the west pavement , and a small gasp escapes Toshi ' s lips as it wobbles , defies gravity , and then rights itself . As it disappears down the street , the roar of the engine moves through Toshi , and he feels , inexplicably , abandoned . He passes through the grounds of a large shrine , its paths lined with unlit stone lanterns and thick-leaved trees that block out the light from the street . In the darkness , Jane suddenly looms large . She opens her front door over and over again while Toshi looks for  | the source of his frustration in the angle of her head , in the light reflecting off her bared breasts . In front of the shrine , he inserts a coin in a fortune vending machine , and a white slip of paper slides into his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is kyo , bad luck . Toshi ties the paper to the bough of a small tree next to the machine . The tree 's branches are heavy with knotted slips of white paper . He walks away quickly without looking back , leaving his bad luck there . Jane behind him . AKIRA 'S COMPUTER GAME IS WAILING AND BEEPING , Wan-chan is barking , and the phone is ringing . Toshi , bent over his desk , tries to ignore it all and draw : Lips puckered for a kiss . A hidden knife . Chocolate Girl 's thoughts float in bubbles above her head as she lassos a beached whale and tows it off a sandbar in Nagasaki Harbor . His own thoughts ? Boredom with work . Relief that Jane seems finally to be over . What to do about Lucy . He is bewildered by these Americans ? fascinated , yet discouraged . Over dinner last night , their first meeting in weeks , Paul finally told him  | about Michael Aoi , his Japanese-American boyfriend who died of AIDS . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you were so young when I met you , I thought you would n't understand , " Paul said . " I know I 'm a difficult person , but I 'm trying hard not to be . You think I 'm the strong one , but I depend on you . " " You 're my best friend , " Toshi said , thinking , Will we ever truly know each other ? Do I see the same Paul as Lucy sees ? Toshi grew up on a narrow peninsula , traveled coast to coast by bus in less than an hour . Paul grew up in America , a country so expansive that it spills over into the rest of the world . Is that why Americans spill out their thoughts and emotions so easily ? Paul could never be confined in a six-tatami-mat room . Mami answers the phone , employing a string of words so polite and rarefied that Toshi has trouble understanding her . She passed the first audition , and soon she will be presented to the Crown Prince along with a thousand other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes at night to learn posture , deportment , and the arcane language of the Imperial Family . " Toshi-chan , it 's for you . " He puts down his pen , stranding Chocolate Girl in the air above the Great Buddha of Kamakura . Inside the bronze Buddha , three young Thai girls cower in fear . He picks up the phone . " This is Okamoto . " " Mr. Toshi Okamoto ? " A man . Officious . p 193 " Yes . " " This is the Tokyo Metropolitan Police . " They 've linked Jane to the fire . A grain of rice rolls down his forehead , catches in his right eyebrow . Wan-chan barks , " Yip , yip , yip . " " Quiet , Wan-chan . Toshi-chan is on the phone . No bones for you , " Mami scolds . " Your father is Fumio Okamoto , from Rausu , Hokkaido ? " " Yes . " His father ? " I 'm sorry to have to give you this bad news . " " Bad news ? " Toshi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your father was found on the Yamanote line . He had a heart attack on the train . " " A heart attack ? He 's here in Tokyo ? Is he all right ? " Sea wind whistles through the telephone . Clouds over the Russian islands rush toward him . If the wind blows loud enough he wo n't have to hear what he suddenly knows is coming next . " I 'm afraid he died on the train . " " Died ? " His father stands in a cloud of dust outside the noodle shop , bowing . His father sits alone at night in front of the TV , smoking a cigarette , lifting his glass of beer . Every night . Year after year . " Yes . Your name and phone number were in his bag . "  | Toshi picks the grain of rice out of his eyebrow and looks at it . His hand is shaking . Surely , there 's been a mistake . " Excuse me , but my father is dead ? " " I 'm sorry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'd like you to please come down to the hospital to identify him . " He hangs up the phone and stares at his drawings . There 's a pounding of waves in his ears that drowns out everything around him . The Thai girls , their mouths wide open , wait for him to draw in their cries for help . Nakamura , Akira , and Mami circle his desk and look at him as if he is someone to feel sorry for . Mami holds Wan-chan out to him . Soldiers line the street in front of Shinjuku Station , their shining shields and batons held out in front of them like sacred objects . Behind them , people crawl over a mountain of rice , fill up their pockets and briefcases and shopping bags . The white mountain diminishes before Toshi ' s eyes . And in the plastic face guards of the soldiers ' helmets , he sees his own reflection , expanding and contracting , over and over again .  | TARO MEETS TOSHI 'S PLANE , AND THEY WAIT TOGETHER on the tarmac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unloaded and placed in the back of a van . He recalls what his father told him six years before , on the day he flew to Tokyo for his entrance examination . " I 've never been on an airplane , " he had said , handing Toshi an envelope filled with money . So he 'd finally flown on an airplane , but too late to enjoy it . And he 'd come to Tokyo to see his son too late too . When Toshi began middle school , his father opened a special savings account for his college education . Every week , he drove to the bank and deposited money . He paid Toshi wages when he helped him in the shop during the dinner hour , and that money he deposited for him too . " This is no place for you to spend your life , " his father had told him many times . " There are better places . Get away from here and make a good life for yourself . "  | Toshi had gotten away . But his father had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to college , he stayed . Why ? Was it to be near his mother ? Toshi would never know . His father was as silent in life as he now is in death . The van with his father 's body drives off , and he and Taro walk back toward the pickup truck . In front of them , the terminal building seems unanchored , as if it might float up into the wide , clear sky , higher and higher , until it disappears . Like his father . Toshi fights back tears of anger . The noodle shop , isolated and mute , at the end of the road . A giant wave might have swept the two-story building away at any time . The ground could have opened up suddenly beneath them . He 'd learned about such things in school . Japan is constantly shifting beneath our feet , their science teacher calmly told them as he unrolled colored diagrams of the earth 's crust . The girls played nervously with the buttons on their white shirts . The boys giggled and shook the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the students filled buckets with soap and water , got down on their hands and knees , and scrubbed the wood-planked classroom floor , the hallways and staircases , always alert , anticipating motion . Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes . It can happen here , their teacher warned them . A terrifying sound like a roaring train , then people vanish into clouds of sulphur .  | Toshi turns away from Taro and wipes his tears . Could n't all of their lives have been different ? If only someone had spoken , the words would have rent the silence in their house . The tarmac continues to unroll before him , a dark carpet on the flat prairie . His mother is already at the noodle shop . She and Zeni , the Filipino girl from the inn , are washing the floor when he arrives . " Are you all right ? " She steps outside into the sunlight and tugs off her rubber gloves . She 's sweating . " I 'm fine . " " It 's so warm today . " Smiling briefly , she takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the back of her neck . The trees on the slope behind the shop are thick with leaves , shiny and dark as pepper skins . " And you , Mother ? " She nods . " I 'm okay . " She looks past him at the sea , and he turns to follow her gaze . The air is so transparent that the islands seem to have moved closer to shore , their usual haziness wiped away to reveal a glaring clarity . " I 'm okay , " she repeats . The funeral will be held in the shop . Toshi , his mother , and Zeni scrub the grease off the walls and countertop . They carry two tables just outside the door , where  | Toshi 's middle school English teacher , Mrs. Hayashi , and two other women from town cover them with white cloth . They arrange the boxes and lists , ink and brushes . Every visitor will bring a black-rimmed white envelope filled with money . They 'll sign their names , and their donations will be recorded . Granny is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits in a chair in the sunlight , talking to them as they work . " People will probably give three thousand yen . Maybe a few of the fishermen , five thousand , " Granny says . His mother nods . " Whatever . " " Is n't there some family somewhere we should try to get in touch with ? " " No . You know there is n't . There 's nobody left , " his mother says sharply , and she picks up a bucket of dirty water and carries it around to the back of the shop . He 's never heard her speak rudely to Granny before . But Granny does n't seem to notice . " Nobody left . Nobody at all . It must be lonely for you , Toshi-chan . " Granny closes her eyes , as if to better picture this nothingness that surrounds him .  | THE FRESH BAMBOO SHOOTS ON THE COUNTER WERE still covered with damp , spring earth , filling the shop with the smell of the young forest . Carrots , onions , and eggplants were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sliced . A pot of water boiled on the stove . Toshi , six years old , changed out of his school clothes and ran down the stairs barefoot . His mother stood behind the counter in an old T-shirt , peeling an apple for his snack . His father was drinking tea and watching his afternoon detective show . " I told my teacher I have no relatives , but he says that 's impossible , that all Japanese people have relatives living someplace , " he announced . The sun streamed in the side window next to the stove . The window was always kept open , even in winter , to let out the cooking smoke and the smell of gas . " Is it true ? Do I have cousins ? And aunts and uncles ? " " Ouch . " His mother dropped the small knife , put her thumb in her mouth . She looked at his father until he turned off the TV , then she went out the back screen door , letting it slam behind her .  | Toshi sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea across the table . Toshi took a sip . It was cold . " Is Mother all right ? " he asked , afraid that he had said something wrong . Already at six , he knew that there were things about her he had to be careful of . " She does n't like to talk about what 's past , that 's all . " He got up and turned the flame off under the boiling water , then stood facing the open window , squinting at the sunlight . " Your mother and I came here after the war . All of our relatives were killed in the war . Everybody . Parents . Brothers and sisters . Aunts and uncles too . There 's nobody left . It makes your mother sad . Do you know what war I 'm talking about ? " " Yes . " He knew . There had been a big war . America had dropped terrible bombs on Japan and had killed many people . " The Americans killed my relatives ? " His father hesitated . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Maybe there is somebody left and you do n't know . Maybe I have cous-ins , " he said , longing for there to be more than just him and his mother and father . He wanted their house to be filled with people . " We came from down south . A place you 've never heard of . And there 's nobody . So you can tell your teacher he 's wrong . " " Ca n't I at least tell my teacher the name of the place ? "  | His father did n't answer . He turned the TV back on , but the detective show was over . The news was on . A white-skinned foreigner in a suit and necktie was standing next to the Emperor . They shook hands , then the foreigner smiled at the camera . " Is he an American ? " Toshi asked . Was this the man who had killed his relatives ? " Yes . " Toshi studied the American carefully . He looked friendly . He had a wide grin and big , open hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stiff next to him . His father dumped the vegetables into the sink and turned on the faucet . He was through talking with him . Toshi stepped into his sneakers and went out the back door . His mother was sitting on the concrete stoop , weaving blades of grass around her cut thumb like a ring . He sat down next to her . " I 'm sorry , Mother . Does it hurt ? " " It 's nothing . Just a small cut . You did n't do anything wrong . I just do n't like to remember unhappy things , " she said , sliding the grass ring off . She took his hand in hers and tried the ring on each of his fingers , finally fitting it onto his thumb . " You have your father and me . We all have each other . Is n't that enough ? " " Yes , " he said . " Are you lonely ? " " No. "  | Up on the slope , there was no wind at all . But on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves shimmer , as if nudged by a breeze . So he knew that something was alive up there . Maybe his mother and father were wrong . Maybe the three of them were not alone . HE FINDS HIS MOTHER SITTING ON THE STOOP , HER RUBber gloves and the bucket of dirty water at her side . He dumps the water out on the grass , then sits down next to her . " Are you all right ? " She nods , and looks up at the steep slope , as if searching for something . Toshi is worried about her . She has n't said much since he called her from Tokyo and repeated the story they 'd told him at the hospital : how his father had slumped over in his seat , but no one had paid any attention . " There are so many homeless people sleeping on the trains these days , " the policeman had said . Dying , or already dead , his father circled the city for hours until the Rice Party tried to bomb the tracks outside of Ueno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's when we found him . " What is his mother feeling ? He wants to ask her , but p 203 he does n't . And he wishes she would ask him what he 's feeling . Because he does n't know . On the plane ride up to Hokkaido , he replayed his father 's death the way it had been described to him , the way he imagined it . Over and over again , he watched his father die , watched his face , searching for a clue to the man , to their relationship . But all he feels is horror , and guilt : The Yamanote line tracks are only about fifty meters away from Nakamura Studio . They could see the trains passing from the window . While Toshi was at his desk drawing silly cartoons , his father rode by again and again , dying , surrounded by strangers . He leaves his mother sitting on the stoop , goes back inside and closes the door quietly behind him . Zeni is out front with Granny . He looks around the noodle shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in memory , the smell of broth and soy sauce and cigarettes wiped away . The front door and windows are open . In the clean air and sunlight , the shop looks old and shabby , its walls and ceiling darkened by grease and smoke . It makes him sad to think that his father lived his life here . Toshi opens the closet , thinking that there are things they 'll have to sort through . Clothes , papers , some remnants of his father 's life . " There 's hardly anything , " he says . " Do n't forget about his car , " his mother says . They 've both bathed and are drinking tea in the back  | room . In the front room , she 's already laid out their mattresses . " I do n't need a car in Tokyo . Why do n't you take it ? " " We could use another car . But I have no right to anything , you know . I 'm not his wife anymore . " " Take it , please . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess you should sell it . Inheritance taxes are very high . I can ask Taro to take care of it for you if you 'd like . " " Please . If he does n't mind . " He looks around the room for something to take back to Tokyo with him , something to remind him of his life with his father . But nothing has changed upstairs or downstairs since his childhood , except for new counter stools when the old ones wore out , an occasional coat of paint rolled on right over the grease . He wonders if anyone else has ever been in these upstairs rooms except for him and his mother and his father . " Your father was a man who did n't want many things . " " Yes , I know . I wonder ... " " What ? " " Well , why he decided to come to Tokyo to visit me . " He has been thinking about this ever since the phone call from the police . Was there something his father wanted to say to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " I suppose not , " he says , convinced he has missed something important . Something he needs to know . " Toshi-chan ? Do you think your father was an unhappy man ? " " Yes , " he says immediately , although he 's never actually thought about it , and is as surprised by his quick answer as he is by her question . As a child , he watched his father move along so silently and predictably that even now it is difficult to think of him as anything other than his routines and habits . What time he got up in the morning . How often he bought a new car , or changed an item on the menu . Cold Chinese noodles in the summer , deep-fried oysters in the winter . She opens her overnight bag and takes out a flat wooden box inscribed with faded calligraphy . " It 's true . He was unhappy . And it was my fault . That 's why I left . I thought he still had time to make a happy life without me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toshi is startled by this , and wary . She 's never spoken about his father in this way before , not in all the years since she left . He 'd always assumed it was the other way around  --  that he and his father had made her unhappy . It was , after all , her unhappiness that they 'd had to accommodate , around which they 'd arranged their lives . She opens up the box and hands him an old , black-and-white photograph . A handsome young man standing in the rain . It is a moment before Toshi realizes that  | it is his father . He realizes that he 's never seen a picture of him before . They never took pictures in their family , even on trips , or at his school sports events and graduations . They did n't own a camera . Except for Toshi 's drawings , they had no narrative of their lives together . It was as if his parents had purposely eluded a visual record , had decided they would never want to look back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to me . It was my fault our marriage did n't work . " She stands up and stamps her feet to get the blood circulating . " I left him too late . He was already so unhappy . I 'm sorry for that . But I wanted you to know so you do n't blame him . " It occurs to him that she might be lying to protect his father now that he 's dead . There is so much he wants to ask her , a lifetime of questions . But even now , as his father 's death changes the rules between them , and as she reveals so much , he ca n't bring himself to ask her for more than she 's offering . And after all , it was she and his father who taught him not to ask . He looks down at the brittle photograph in his hand : His grinning father holds his hat out in front of him in both hands , upside down , catching the rain , as if he is offering it as a gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't recognize curl like waves against a dark sea of a sky . His father looks happy . And he gazes at the camera , Toshi decides , as if he is very much in love with whoever is taking his picture .  | " Who took this picture ? " " I did , " his mother says . So once they did own a camera . " Here . " He holds the photograph out to her . " No . You keep it . Please . It 's the way you should remember him . " " This is n't my father . I never knew him this way . You did , " he says . She turns away . " Well , time for bed . " She shuts off the ceiling light , as if to hide her face from him , or his from her . " We have a busy day tomorrow , so we should get a good night 's sleep . " She waits for a moment , perhaps for him to say something . When he does n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His mother is much younger than his father , so she must have been a girl when she took the picture he now holds so carefully in his hand . Like the best lacquerware , it seems to have no weight . The clouds have rolled in off the sea , and it is dark outside the window that faces the slope . If there was a moon , it would be shining on the white birch . His mother always avoided the front room ; she liked sitting here in the back , looking out at the trees . Toshi preferred the front windows . The lights on fishing boats and , on clear nights , the shimmering lights on the islands . Those lights always looked like someplace he could go to .  | THE DAYS OF THE WAKE AND FUNERAL ARE A BLUR : His father laid out in a dark suit Toshi never saw him wear , his face covered with a cloth and his hands folded neatly on his chest , his gold wristwatch still keeping time . The altar and his father 's photograph set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after closing , he had lined up the bottles of soy sauce and refilled them from a big tin container . Later , Toshi and his mother sit in folding chairs and nod silently as , one by one , his father 's old customers and the people he 'd done business with for almost forty years bow to them , bow to his father 's framed photograph , bring their hands together in prayer , offer incense , bow again . The Buddhist priest recites the sutras , drones on and on . The incense makes Toshi sleepy . Then his father 's body is cremated . Together , Toshi and his mother guide a pair of long chopsticks over the ashes and pick out his bones . And finally , the cemetery , gravestones adorned with offerings of cigarettes , bottles of sake , and bright flowers . In front of a child 's gravestone , someone has placed a small bottle of milk and a Snoopy doll . A colorful pinwheel spins in the damp breeze . On the  | other side of the coast road , past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come ashore . There is sushi and sake and beer in the upstairs rooms . Outside the open windows , the rain has begun to fall . Seeing people in these rooms for the first time in his life , Toshi is oddly euphoric . He had worried that the rooms were too bare , that everyone would see how his father had spent all those years with nothing but sadness . But filled up with people , eating and drinking and smoking , filled up with conversation and laughter , the rooms do n't seem lonely at all . Toshi and his father slept and drank tea together in these two rooms for ten years after his mother left them . But they never lived here , he now understands . They only occupied the rooms . HIS FATHER OFFERS HIS UPTURNED HAT . HE CRADLES IT in his hands . A vessel . Is it filled with rainwater ? With rice wine ? The juice of mandarin oranges ?  | Back in his Tokyo apartment , Toshi props the snapshot up and he draws his father . Through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth . He looks for explanations in the details of the photograph , as if following the roll of his father 's shirtsleeve will describe the man . At the funeral , people talked to him about his father . He was kind , honest , hardworking , they said . But he was also a silent man , Toshi knew , a father who never spoke to his son . And the girl with the camera . What was his mother like then ? Why did his father marry her ? He looks for her in the young man 's eyes . Hungry , he cuts the string around the big box his mother handed him when he left for the airport . Inside , she 's packed apples , cucumbers , cans of tuna fish and sea urchin . Homemade rice balls with red pickled plums inside of them like red suns on white flags . At the bottom of the box is an envelope with three thousand yen . Such a small amount of money wo n't buy much in Tokyo . But this , he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even after she left for the inn , she never stopped trying to take care of him . Every Sunday night , she walked him to the bus stop in Utoro . He crossed the peninsula and returned to his father 's noodle shop carrying shopping bags and cartons tied up with string . His mother pressed on him bags of rice , fruit and vegetables , presents of underwear and paja- p 211 mas and gloves , as if she believed that weight and volume might cancel out time and distance . But she had been wrong . Toshi undresses , lays out his futon , and he remembers : Nights above the shop between his father and mother . His father snores . His mother 's sleeping face suddenly contorts in pain . She murmurs , exhaling a bad dream . Disturbed , he gets up and looks out the balcony doors at the rain over Tokyo . But when he glances down at his own body , he is a small boy again , standing at the open window above the painted bowl of noodles . He looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his cotton pajamas flutter in the wind . A luminous flock of geese flies parallel to shore in a perfect diamond . The wind stretches the diamond out of shape , elongating it , but the geese snap back like an clastic band . He ca n't remember ever seeing anything quite so beautiful , and he turns to call his parents to the window . But they are gone , along with their bedding . He is back in his Tokyo apartment , and there is only one mattress . A cold white rectangle floating on the tatami , adrift .  | TOKYO 'S STREETS ARE UNNAMED AND UNNUMBERED . Neighborhood maps mounted outside subway stations describe labyrinths , and even taxi drivers carry street guides thicker than phone books . Toshi holds up Lucy 's hand-drawn map , turns it sideways , then upside down , aligning it to reality so he can follow her penciled trail of landmarks from the station : A police box , a bicycle store . Turn left at the Kentucky Fried Chicken , right at the phone booth just past the rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a cat leaping off a wall are only distractions . It 's a long way from the station , but he 's glad to walk . The air is dry , the sky white and still  --  as if waiting for the next typhoon or , possibly , the first autumn winds to sweep across the Japan Sea , carrying cold desert air from China . As he walks , he notices the facades and lobbies of apartment buildings , the width of their balconies , imagines a new view from his windows . Toshi has started to look for a new apartment . Jane may have forgotten him , or replaced him , but some nights he still dreams of red envelopes shooting through the mail slot , edges sharp as razor blades . A few nights ago , there was a small earthquake , and he  | dreamed she was pounding on his front door . He woke up sweating . A housewife pedals by on her bicycle , an empty child 's seat in back , a fat daikon radish sticking out of the basket in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenience store , pink and yellow and blue , stops him in his tracks on this quiet morning . Set against a landscape of detergent boxes and toilet tissue rolls , they 're bright wildflowers gathering sunlight . On a magazine rack , every publication carries the same cover photo : The Crown Prince and the American actress Brooke Shields lean across a candlelit table , across champagne glasses and , according to the caption , plates of smoked Norwegian salmon and New Zealand kiwis , their hands  --  his small and delicate , hers large and tipped with polish  --  touching . Lucy lives by herself in an old , one-story wooden house , hidden in the shadow of a shut-down Panasonic factory that is covered with graffiti  --  nationalistic slogans that have been appearing all over Japan recently . Spray painted on walls and on the curved shells of subway cars . Carved with knives into the great wooden platform of Kiyomizu Temple in Kyoto . After the press reported the Crown Prince 's dinner with the American actress , a group of laid-off Toyota workers burned AMERICA=AIDS into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The letters were five meters high and could be seen by passengers on passing bullet trains .  | FOREIGN RICE IS POISON and LONG LIVE THE EMPEROR hang menacingly over Lucy 's tile roof like storm clouds . But when Toshi walks through the wooden gate , he finds himself in a peaceful garden of dwarf bamboo and clipped shrubs . He is about to ring the doorbell when he hears voices inside , two people speaking Japanese . An old woman 's voice . " Today is Wednesday , that means nonburnable garbage . Glass whiskey bottles and beer cans , for example . " A man , a foreigner . " I apologize . I did n't know . When should I put my burnable garbage out ? " Is he at the wrong house ? She had n't said anything about other people . Her landlady and Hugh ? He thought they would be alone . He rings the bell , and the conversation abruptly stops . Lucy opens the door , smiles , and tugs at the black T-shirt that stretches down to her knees . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if she just stepped out of the bath . The smell of soap drifts down to him . She looks so pretty , her skin white as milk . " Hi . I 'm glad you 're here . Come on in . " As he steps up and out of his shoes , he holds out a bag of pastries he bought near the station . " It 's just a little gift . " " Oh , thank you . You did n't have to . " She opens the bag . " But actually , I 'm starving . They look delicious . Thanks a lot . Was my map okay ? " He follows her into a tatami room that looks out  | onto the garden . There is no furniture , only cushions , a small table , and yellow flowers in a blue vase . Something he might have drawn . " This is very nice , " he says , but he 's disappointed . Toshi has never been out of Japan , so whenever he visits a foreigner at home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartments are the best , for even when they 're small , they arrange them so that there is always somewhere to go to , someplace you have n't seen yet . Americans seem to carry space around with them . " I love living here , although you know how old Japanese houses are . Freezing in the winter and like an oven in the summer . I ran right out and bought this air conditioner the day after I moved in . " She slides open a door , and they are in an airconditioned room , carpeted , with Western furniture . More like what he 'd expected . But where are the other people ? Is there a back door ? " I 'm sorry about the mess . I was going to clean up for you , but then I decided you should see it as it really is . " " It 's not a mess , " he says . And it is n't . The room is filled with audio equipment , one wall taken up by tape decks and amplifiers , equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of switches and dials . There are shelves filled with CD 's and cassette tapes , an electronic keyboard , and speakers as big as refrigerators .  | " Now you know why I have to live in a house . I make much too much noise for an apartment . " " It must be expensive . " He could n't imagine having an entire house to himself in Tokyo . " Oh , no . Japanese people do n't want to live in these old , drafty houses anymore . Only foreigners find them charming . I pay almost nothing . I 'm sure the landlord will tear it down in a few years and put up a big , ugly apartment building . Come sit here . " She leads him to an old wooden rocking chair , then sits in a plain chair opposite him . " Is n't that chair great ? I found it . " " You found it ? " He rocks back and forth , as a way of showing his appreciation . Where do people find chairs ? Nobody he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone threw it out . My friend , Norma , she found a practically brand-new Sony CD player on a garbage pile . Japanese people just throw things out . " " Yes , " he says , wondering if this is supposed to be a good or bad trait . She jumps up so fast it startles him . She 's so tall in this low-ceilinged room . " Do you want coffee ? You can have tea if you do n't want coffee . " " Coffee is fine . " " Great . I have really good coffee . " She smiles , as if he 's just paid her a compliment , and leaves the room . He hears the coffee grinder , then the kettle whistling .  | He stands up and stares out at her small , neat garden . A pair of wooden sandals is lined up neatly on a flat rock on the other side of the glass door , and a stone path loops through the garden . The stones are swept clean and splashed with water . Did Lucy do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he knows about her . An American woman . A composer . A married woman who is getting a divorce . Then he thinks , What do n't I know about her ? What do I need to know ? Lucy places a tray with coffee and the pastries on the table between them , then hands him a cracked ceramic mug . " Help yourself to milk and sugar . I hope it 's not too strong . " She bites into one of the pastries , and powdered sugar falls like snow onto her black T-shirt . She wipes it away nonchalantly . " Oh , this is good . I was so hungry . Usually I eat something in the morning , some toast or yogurt or something . But this morning I had no time . " Was it because he was coming over that she had no time ? Or was it because of her other guests ? He sips his coffee . It 's strong . " Oh , I 'm sorry . God , am I rude , eating without offering you any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll bet you 're thinking . " " No , I was n't , " he says .  | She laughs and holds out the plate of pastries . He chooses one without powdered sugar . " Why do n't I play you my music while we drink our coffee . Then we can talk about your design for the CD cover . That is , if you like the music . I want you to be truthful . " She goes over to the wall of audio equipment and starts pressing buttons . The big speakers crackle , and the man 's voice he heard earlier comes booming out : " I see . Burnable garbage is Tuesdays , Thursdays , and Saturdays . " She laughs and pushes another button . " Oops , wrong tape . I 'm trying to improve my Japanese , but I 'm so lazy I only put it on when I 'm in the bath or on the toilet . " Toshi closes his eyes and listens , and he waits for something he will recognize . There 's the peculiar but familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briskly plucked . Does Lucy play these Japanese instruments ? Then he recognizes a piano , and a flute . But there 's no familiar melody . It 's nothing like either Japanese or Western music . It 's not at all what he expected . What will he be able to say about it ? But Lucy is not what he expected , either . And so , slowly , he relaxes . And the most extraordinary thing happens : The melody arranges itself into pictures inside his head , as if Lucy is drawing with music , each note a brush stroke . As the melody expands , colors appear and fill in the out-  | lines . These are not cartoons . They are the pictures he wants to draw . They materialize inside his head , they come rushing at him , up and down the musical scale : His father 's pale skin reflected on the surface of the water . His mother brushes out her long hair in her room at the inn . The music speeds up and the images move back through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father walk on a thin stretch of rocky beach . Toshi is n't there , he is n't even born yet , but there is a wide space between his parents , as if they are making room for him . His father reaches out across the expanse of sky and sea to his mother , but with each step of her bare feet at the water 's edge , she drifts away from him . His pants rolled up to his knees , his father kneels and scoops up a sand crab . His mother turns and laughs . Her loose hair billows in the sea wind . His father laughs too . Unexpectedly , the music ends , and the image dissolves , seawater absorbed into the sand , leaving only a foamy residue of sadness behind . He opens his eyes , startled to find himself in Lucy 's house . He needs to draw what he 's seen before he forgets . Lucy is watching him . He feels so sad about his father 's death and what his mother told him . How she turned away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to do : He 'll draw his parents , and his own life growing up with them , shuttling back and forth across the narrow peninsula . That 's how he can bring them all back together , give them a history .  | " You do n't like it ? " she asks quietly . She searches his face , sees his sadness . How could he explain to her how he feels ? It 's as if Lucy has visited the world he came from and brought something back in her music . " I like it very much . Really . It 's sad music . " " No one ever said that . " " I 'm sorry . " " No . It 's not bad . I do n't mind ' sad . ' " They sit silently for a few minutes , looking at each other . He wishes he could think of something else to say . He 's afraid he 's disappointed her . The music has ended , but he still feels disoriented , like he 's moving , traversing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Lucy smiles , and , unexpectedly , these two worlds merge in the line of her neck , in the contour of a snowy slope . She takes him to a nearby soba restaurant for lunch . They stir the raw yolks of spotted quail eggs into the dark sauce with their chopsticks , add wasabi and green scallions , and they tell each other everything they can think of about their lives while they dip and slurp their noodles . She tells him : " Normal parents . Two weird , funny brothers . San Francisco schools . University in Berkeley . I met Hugh there . The Conservatory of Music . Some performing . Recording . Then Hugh got money to do the film on the rice riots , and I decided to come too . I  | mean , Japan . I did n't know anything at all . Zen , sushi , Sony . " He picks out words . Place names . Ideas . He nods his head , wanting more . " I started studying Japanese music , and so here I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " An uneventful , reasonably happy life . My parents were very supportive so I guess I 'm not too insecure . " Supportive . To support . Holding something up so that it does n't fall . The way , in the winter , he 'd take Granny 's arm to help her over icy patches on the road . Did anyone support him while he was growing up ? " What about you ? " she asks . He tells her things he thinks she might want to hear : The noodle shop . Snow . His mother and father . The inn in Utoro . The letter to Audrey Hepburn . " Audrey Hepburn ! " She claps her hands . " I ca n't imagine it . Audrey Hepburn in Hokkaido . " He 's thirsty and drinks glass after glass of barley tea , for as he talks , he 's still thinking about the drawings her music drew in his head . And he finds himself telling her more than he intended to : about his father 's death , and the funeral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly , nodding , encourages him to go on . The years when his mother was so silent , how she 'd walk out the door without a word and not return for hours . And then , after she left , his father 's silence . When Toshi is done talking , he 's curiously calm . He 's never told this story before , not even to Paul . They  | stare at each other across the table until Lucy stands up and holds out her hand . " Come on . I have a surprise for you . " She leads him across a busy boulevard and under an expressway to the edge of a vista that makes Toshi laugh : Pedal boats shaped like swans drift in circles . " A pond ? " " My secret pond , " she says . " Do you like it ? " The dark water shimmers against a background of concrete apartment buildings  --  laundry hanging on every narrow balcony , underwear twirling in the breeze . A narrow footbridge leads out to a sumo-ring  --  size island where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willow trees . Toshi and Lucy rest in the shade there , their backs against a cigarette vending machine . An orchestral version of " Home on the Range " floats across the water from speakers planted along the shoreline . Real swans drift by , and then the swan boats . A child 's hand reaches out to scatter popcorn , and the water churns with the bright , flashing colors of carp . " It 's peaceful here , in an odd , Tokyo sort of way , " Lucy says in a sleepy voice . He nods but does n't reply . They sit for a long time like this , neither of them talking . He does n't feel that he has to , or that she needs him to . A small movement catches his eye , and he looks down at the water 's edge . A turtle emerges from the pond . " Look ! " p 223 Possibly startled by his voice , the turtle skitters back down toward the water and rolls over onto its shell . It struggles to upright itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets up , brushes off the back of her T-shirt . " Careful . It could bite . " " It wo n't bite me . It knows that I want to help . " The turtle 's head retreats into its shell . She picks it up and turns it over , places it at the water 's edge . " You can come out now , " she says , as if talking to a frightened child . At that very moment , the late afternoon sunlight streams through the willow trees like a breeze , lighting up Lucy with colors that come right out of the air , colors that Toshi ca n't even name . And everything else disappears . The music , the swans . The four joggers on the opposite shore , stretching and smoking cigarettes . There is only Lucy and the turtle , which cautiously pokes its head out , finds its feet firmly on the ground , and slides with a splash back into the water . A splash that ripples in Toshi ' s chest . He walks her home down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have to move closer to the cinder block walls that conceal the neighborhood 's small houses , and their bare arms brush . Beyond the high walls , dogs bark . Telephones ring . He smells rice steaming . Blue television light skims the tops of their heads to define their progress through the growing darkness .  | They reach her front gate . " Well , you have the cassette of my music . So when you come up with an idea , call me , " she says . But she does n't go in . " I 'll make some drawings soon . " He 'd like to touch her , to kiss her , but he hesitates . " You can fax them to me . Or we can meet . Whatever . " " Okay . " " Well ... " She slides open the gate . In the garden , glass wind chimes tinkle . Above their heads , the Panasonic factory has faded to a benign shape in Tokyo 's starless night sky . " Would you like to come in ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he wonders , Will she turn out to be like Jane ? What will happen if he sleeps with her ? Foreign women always surprise him , and tonight he does n't want to be surprised . He needs to keep those drawings in his head . She mistakes his hesitation for something else . " I guess you have plans for tonight . I , well , let 's just call each other , okay ? " He nods , distracted , for an image surfaces unexpect edly , a memory . She smiles and waves , even though he is standing right in front of her , then ducks through the gate and slides it closed . " Good night . " " Good night , " he says , already mentally laying out a  | white sheet of paper before him . He watches the ice floes melt at the beginning of spring , hears the loud cracking . Lucy steps up and removes her sandals , closes the door behind her . The lights go on in her house , and festival bonfires flare up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old lady 's voice . " In your country , what do you do with your garbage ? Do you have garbage in America ? " EVERY SPRING , THE ICE THAT GIRDS SHIRETOKO PENINsula dissolves into blue crystals and washes ashore . The snowpack melts . The mountains swell like overripe fruit , pouring water and mud onto the towns . The fishermen lower their boats back into the sea , and return to work . And in Utoro , at the first full moon in April , the townspeople hold a three-day festival to honor the Fishing God , a local Shinto deity who keeps watch over the town and sea from a **25;0;TOOLONG portable shrine sandwiched between the Yamazaki bakery and the prefectural administrative office on
