Olive the oxygen atom and her sister Ozzy lived in a fancy complex on some extensive property downtown . The structure of the complex was somewhat irregular but it had lovely symmetrical lattice work on the ground level where they resided . Inside their unit , their resting areas were separate but they frequently overlapped and occupied the same region of space and consequently had formed a fairly strong bond over the years . Rather than going it alone , like those snobbish Noble gases in the penthouse who always kept to themselves , Olive and Ozzy were pleased they had paired up locally . Although closely related , their physical properties were actually quite different . While Olive was quite stable , Ozzy had lost a neutron when she was young and consequently developed a much more unstable nature . Although , at times , Olive was perturbed by Ozzy 's highly energetic nature , she tried to remain relaxed when . Ozzy showed signs of continuous decay and hurled positrons around the place . As for Ozzy , she knew her life-time would be short and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ozzy had been active as usual and played tennis in the morning on the nearby quartz , followed later in the afternoon by an aerobic workout . Despite all this activity , Ozzy was nowhere near depleted , and was busy planning what she and Olive could do with their free energy as the evening . approached . <p> " Let 's do something relaxing , " suggested Olive . " Ronald Ray-gun , who played the leading role in Star Wars , is in a film at the local cinnabar tonight . Afterwards we could stop at the fairgrounds and ride the ferrous wheel . " <p> " How Bohring , " replied Ozzy , " I want some excitement . Let 's take the hetero cycles for a nitride and check out Avogadro 's bar . " Olive was n't excited about bars . Furthermore , Avogadro 's was in a seedy part of town where undesirable oxygen scavengers were known to lurk . Nevertheless , she reluctantly agreed to go . Avogadro 's bar was a popular atomic hangout where Ozzy worked during the week . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she liked the atmosphere and there was n't a whole lot of pressure . Later that evening they arrived at Avogadro 's and as she walked in , Ozzy went over to greet Sol Furic who was dispensing solvents at the bar . <p> " Hi Sol , give me a bowl of silicon chips and a plate of your extra hot gamma ray source , " she said and introduced Olive to him . " I see the place is real busy . " <p> " Yep , we 're really close packed tonight . Now , do you two want any liquids ? " <p> " I 'll just have an iced limewater please , " requested Olive . <p> " And the usual nonaqueous solvent for me , Sol , " added Ozzy , " but no diet coke in that , I 've given up trying to reduce . You should visit here more frequently , " she remarked turning to Olive , " you see some unusual characters . Look there , a group of foreign Germaniums . And you know what they say about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to look at the band who were warming up . <p> " Hey Sol , I thought Benny Borane and the Dimer Dozen were playing here this week ? " she asked . <p> " Well , Avogadro had to discharge Benny when he caught him packing anion , " replied Sol . " But Freddy Lead and his heavy metal band finished playing a giga at the Monazite Sands yesterday and Avogadro signed them up for the next few nights . Personally , I do n't go for those metal bands , they tend to attract bad elements in here . " <p> " Freddy Lead ! ! " exclaimed Olive suddenly much to Ozzy 's surprise , " Wow , he 's exothermic ! " <p> " What ? " cried Ozzy , " I thought you only liked the classical conductors ? " <p> " Well I do , but when I heard Freddy 's hit song , Indigo Blues , he smelted my heart instantaneously . " <p> " I would n't get too excited about Freddy Lead , " added Sol , " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , he may not seem like an active metal on the surface , but Freddy has the potential to come between you two . Rumor also has it that he recently spent some time in a mono clinic . " <p> " I did n't think you would be attracted to the likes of him , " said Ozzy in a surprised tone . " Believe me I 've seen his type before , they 're all just plumb bums . Trust me , he 'd dump you when the first cute halogen drifted by and you would be reduced to nothing . " <p> But Olive was not to be so easily dissolutioned . When Freddy and the band started playing she just sat at the bar in ore , and psi'ed . " Oh look , " she cried " that 's Cad Calloway on the drums and Old Mossy Zinc on base . And look there , it 's Stan the Man on the tin whistle and symbols . " <p> As the evening wore on , Ozzy circulated through the bar but Olive sat glassy eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundance of unfamiliar solvents . Sol beckoned Ozzy over to the bar . " I 'm a little worried about Olive , " he confided to Ozzy , " that 's her third Raman coke tonight , I think she 's had ampoule . And look at Freddy . " <p> Freddy , who was well aware of Olive 's interest in him , was himself becoming more and more charged as the evening progressed . Both Ozzy and Sol sensed he was about to lose it . As for Olive , although she had no intention of accepting electrons from a stranger , she found Freddy positively , exciting . Eventually , during a break , Freddy slid over to her table and sat down . Up close , Freddy looked a bit dull , in fact he was downright dense , but Olive did n't notice as she peered at him through the dim limelight . Meanwhile , Ozzy was picking up bad vibrations from Olive who apparently wanted to be alone . Sensing the bond between them was somewhat strained that evening , Ozzy went back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been eying her all evening . " Hi , my name 's Uri , " he said brashly , " you into radioactive dating ? I know a little place near Three Mile Island where we could go fission . Interested ? " <p> " Umm , " mumbled Ozzy to Sol , " keep an eye on Olive will you ? This one is really rad and is arousing my curieousity . Think I ' 11 take him up on his offer . " Although Uri was obviously much older than Ozzy , she was attracted to the strong , active type and she hoped that he would n't split like past dates had . <p> Back at Olive 's table , Freddy was busy admiring her dimensions . " Hey babe , " he said , " you certainly obey the law of definite proportions . " Olive , a little embarrassed by such language , tried to ignore it . <p> " Could you play Indigo Blues for me ? It 's my favorite song . The first time I heard it I almost dyed , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " responded Freddy with a grin a yard wide . " So tell me , what 's a cute nonmetal like you doing in a place like this ? " <p> " Well , my sister and I .... , " she began , pointing to Ozzy as she was leaving the bar , " we rode here on our hetero cycles and ... " <p> " Hey , not my scene babe , " Freddy admitted , " never could get coordinated on those things . But maybe after the show you can take a spin with me and the band in our Mercury . We know a great Fluoro Spa down the slope a bit . " Freddy and the three band members clustered around Olive . " So , " said Freddy pressing closer to Olive 's significant figure , " how about a tetrakis for me and the band ? " <p> " Now hang on , " said Olive growing impatient , " I may be a little saturated with alcohol , but I still need some time before I start face-sharing . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Freddy lustering all over her . " We could have plenty of magnetic moments together after the show . I know we 'd make a lovely redox couple . " Olive did n't like the way Freddy and the band were analyzing her valence shell , and became quite irritated . <p> " Just because you heavy metals ionize easily you expect every non-metal you meet to crystallize with you on the first encounter , " cried Olive , " what do you take me for , an oxy moron ? " <p> " Come , come my dear . For a gas your behavior has hardly been ideal , " he added . " Perhaps you could use a little catalyst to get you going , " suggested Freddy as he thrust a cylinder of nitric oxide at her . <p> " Ugh , NO ! " she exclaimed rotating in her seat . But Freddy put his neon the table preventing her from getting up . Poor Olive looked terafied , and Sol decided to step in . <p> " Okay Freddy break it up , keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he approached from the bar . Under ordinary conditions Freddy would n't have felt threatened by Sol , but he could see Sol was becoming hot under the collar and could dissolve the relationship he was trying to form with Olive . At that point the band 's manager , Nate Hydroxide , diffused over to the table . <p> " What the photon 's going on here ? " Nate asked in a caustic tone . <p> " I wish you would keep the band away from our customers , " yelled Sol , " Freddy 's relaxation period is over . I do n't know where you dig up these characters , now keep them away . " But Nate was n't ready to be so easily neutralized by Sol . <p> " Listen pal , do n't mess with Freddy , he 's got a low boiling point . " <p> Sol , by now , was fuming and slapped Nate across the lobes . <p> " Hey watch it , " yelled Nate , " you ca n't a salt me , let 's see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , was no weak base himself . He lepton Sol and the two began to mix it up . As generally occurs in bars that contain bad elements , the place spontaneously erupted . In a matter of nanoseconds all manner of particles were in random motion : pitchers of heavy water flew across the bar , much to the horror of some hydrophobiacs at one table , bowls of sugars were inverted everywhere , and a party of graduated cylinders had their celebrations shattered as Nate and Sol rolled on top of them trying to neutralize each other . A terrible graphite broke out in one corner of the room , and even a group of aquamarines , green with envy , quickly joined in . Eventually all this disturbance brought Avogadro , and his pet mole Millie , from his resting place upstairs . " Hey ! Hey ! " he yelled in vain , " stop all this phytin or I 'll have to call some external forces . " He beckoned to Leon and Noel the two enantiomeric bouncers . But it was useless , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbulence . <p> " What a waste of energy , " mumbled Avogadro to himself as he watched the bar 's entropy soar . He called Sol . " Stop it at once ! " But Sol did n't absorb his comments , he was too busy banging Nate against a bar magnet with great frequency . <p> " Ouch , that Hertz , " sobbed Nate . Avogadro watched as Sol and Nate went round and round , but nothing indicated that the end point was in sight . Moments later , the resonance of sirens could be heard : someone had called the coppers . Since Millie mole was unlicensed , Avogadro did n't want the coppers to unearth her . Besides , she 'd been into his methanol again and was blind drunk . <p> " Order , order , " shouted the coppers bursting in , just as Avogadro and Millie disappeared upstairs . Having already captured some highly excited electrons that had been ejected from the bar during the fight they attempted to restore normality . " Umm , " said one , " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he turned on the fire hose . The aqueous environment diluted most of the violent activity . But there were a lot of broken bonds and quite a few minerals had fractures and were carried away for X-rays . When the salts began to settle down , the authorities searched for the radical initiator . <p> " It 's all her fault , " claimed Nate bitterly , pointing to poor Olive who was resting on the ground , trying to reestablish her equilibrium . <p> " I hate lyes , " said Sol " now you and your formates get out of here . " But before Sol could come to her defence , several coppers dragged Olive off . <p> " Sorry Miss , " said the copper at the station , " afraid I 'm going to have to formally charge you . " <p> " With Watt ? " cried Olive , " it was n't my volt , I was just a spectator . I want to go ohm . " <p> " Not until the circuit judge hears all the fac 's tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come along now , we have a nice unit cell waiting for you . In you go . " said the copper . <p> Meanwhile , Ozzy and Uri had a major fall-out on the way to Three Mile Island . As they travelled back , Ozzy telephoned Sol from Uri 's carvone and learned what had occurred in the bar . She proceeded to the station and on arrival demanded to see Olive . " Just a moment , " said the copper , " is she arylation of yours ? " <p> " Weight a minute pal , " said Ozzy impatiently , " let 's see if we ca n't work something out here . " Within minutes , Olive was released from her cell . <p> Back home , Ozzy explained to Olive how the copper was reluctant to release her , but changed his mind when Ozzy offered him some joules . " So what happened between you and Uri ? " asked Olive . <p> " Well , our fishing trip got as far as Chernobyl 's bait shop , when I discovered Uri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking a parent for them . Never mind , thanks to mankind there 's plenty more isotopes in the sea . And what a night for you , " said Ozzy leading , mercifully , to the concluding moral of this tale . " I hope you have learned your lesson with Freddy : if you do n't get the lead out of your life , you could end up lithargic . " <p>
