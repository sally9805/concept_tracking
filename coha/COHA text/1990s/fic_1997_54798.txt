When Bob Frankenmuth hopped down from the cab of his Chevy pickup , he saw the deer lying on the road with its head twisted around like somebody saying good-bye . He had hit it on the curve . It was dusk , and the shadows were strange . The deer had come out of the pines . First it was n't there , then it was : sudden and jittery . Bob had been thinking about Roxanne and the ways he might leave her : divorce or simple desertion . He had hardly been watching the road . The deer was a doe , it was bound to be a doe . Fucked up one more time , Bob thought . <p> The right front fender was crumpled , and the headlight was broken . Bits of fur were embedded in the grille . Bob kicked the bumper , then walked toward the deer . It was spring , and the deer had begun to come down from the hills . Bob was trying to get back to Kingston from Delhi and had taken a shortcut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doe straddled the yellow line at the curve . Bob hurried to drag it off the road before another car came along . If he wanted , he could keep it . The law said it was his . He could put it into the back of his pickup and take it home for supper . But there was no way he could get Roxanne to cook it given her present attitude toward domesticity . She had given up cooking when she decided to return to college last fall . Bob and the two boys had to fend for themselves . <p> Another car was coming . Bob ran forward to warn the driver . He could hear the tires squealing on the curves . The car was going too fast , given the two-lane road , the decreasing light , and the hills . Bob saw the car 's lights and began waving his arms . The dead doe was just a brown lump on the road between them . The driver slammed on the brakes and swerved around the deer . Then the car went out of control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and going sideways into the trees . It was a black Taurus station wagon . When it swung around , its brake lights made a flashing red arc . The crash against the tree trunks was a deep sound , a metallic crunch , joined with a crumpling and rattling . Bob stopped in the roadway . Where one moment everything had been noise and running , now it was silent . <p> " Christ , " said Bob . He ran for the Taurus , which had come to rest against a tree and was tilted up on its side . One headlight was broken ; the other shone into the pine branches . He got to the driver 's door and pulled it open . The driver was alone in the car : a woman , leaning forward over the steering wheel . At first Bob thought she was unconscious ; then he saw her shoulders heaving , and he thought she was crying . Then he realized she was laughing . She was blond and young-looking . <p> " You all right ? " asked Bob . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road before another car came along . <p> The woman looked up at him . A pretty face with no marks on it , straight hair and a little stub nose . She was laughing , but there were tears in her eyes . " Nothing goes right , does it ? Just nothing at all . " She laughed some more . <p> " Hang on a moment , " said Bob . " I got to move that deer . " <p> Bob ran across the road . Crazy women made him nervous ; you never knew what they might do next . The front fender of the Taurus was bent into the tire , puncturing it , meaning the car was n't drivable , which also meant that Bob would have to give the woman a ride someplace . No telling when he would get home . Oddly enough , he felt good about this . His life with Roxanne felt like a tunnel he 'd gotten stuck in , and here was a sudden veering in another direction . He grabbed the doe 's hind legs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe it weighed two hundred pounds . The body was n't cut up or gory . Its neck was broken , that 's all . Bob thought again about taking the doe with him . " If you were a real wife , " he could say to Roxanne , " you 'd cut this up and cook it . " He began dragging the deer toward his pickup . <p> " You put that thing in the road on purpose ? " asked the woman . She had climbed out of the Taurus and was walking after him . She moved unsteadily . First , Bob wondered if she had been drinking , then he guessed it was shock from the accident . <p> " I hit it about a minute before you came along . " He stared at the woman , trying to determine if she was serious . She was more of a girl . Bob doubted she was twenty-one . She was tall , but still a few inches shorter than he was . Her blond hair hung past her shoulders . She wore jeans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " What 're you doing with it ? " she asked . <p> " I 'm going to put it in the back of my pickup . " <p> " You going to eat it ? " <p> " I might . " <p> " My car wo n't go , " said the woman . <p> Bob kept dragging the deer . " Your car 's messed up , all right , " he said . " I 'll take you to a garage . " <p> " My boyfriend wants to kill himself , " said the girl . " I need to get to his place in a hurry . Can you take me there ? It 's not far . " <p> Bob stood holding the hind feet of the deer . He could feel the sharpness of its small hooves : a weapon that had n't helped it any . The girl had a small , flat face and wore no makeup . He thought how she had been laughing and crying bent over the wheel of her Taurus . <p> " Give me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to feel proprietary about the corpse . If he did n't take it , some trooper would . Besides , he wanted to give it to Roxanne . He 'd dump it right down on the kitchen table and say , " Here ! " <p> The girl took one of the rear hooves , and they pulled the body toward the pickup . Bob sneaked a look at her , trying to judge her figure under the thick sweater . Until Roxanne had gone back to school , Bob had thought of himself as settled down . His sons were eight and ten . Bob built summer houses for rich yuppies from Manhattan , and he invested his profits . His life had been proceeding perfectly smoothly until Roxanne decided she needed her teaching certificate . <p> " Why does your boyfriend want to kill himself ? " asked Bob . He did n't take the girl 's problem seriously . He could n't imagine anybody having really serious problems until they were over thirty . <p> " He thinks I do n't love him . " The girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling the deer . <p> " Do you love him ? " <p> " I ca n't tell anymore . " <p> " You think he 'll kill himself ? " <p> " I do n't know , but he 's got a gun . " <p> They reached the pickup , and Bob let down the gate . He had a stepladder in the back . His tools were in the toolcase . <p> " You take the front hooves , " he told the girl . They both took hold . Bob counted to three , and they heaved the deer into the bed , where it landed with a thunk . Its head hung back , and its large brown eyes seemed to stare at them in the last of the light . <p> " There , " said Bob , " at least that 's done . " He had a sudden thought of how the deer had probably been off to someplace specific , and he wondered if there were other creatures that had begun to miss it . <p> " I 'm Bob Frankenmuth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on his jeans , then offered it to her . She shook it firmly . A lock of hair fell across her eye , and she tossed her head to the side . <p> " Laura Spalding , " she said . <p> " Let 's go see your boyfriend , " said Bob . " You think he 's dangerous ? " <p> " He just ca n't relax . I tell him to chill out , but he ca n't . He 's a jerk . " She stood with her hands shoved in her pockets and her head tilted to one side . On her feet were big Timberland boots with the laces untied . <p> " Sounds like you love him , " said Bob . He climbed into the cab ; the girl got in on the passenger 's side . Several empty beer cans were on the floor , and the girl 's boots bumped against them . It was seven-thirty and almost dark . Bob started the engine . His one headlight shone down the road toward the next curve . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like it that the kid had a gun . <p> " Go straight for about three miles . I 'll tell you where to turn . " <p> Bob released the emergency brake , and the pickup rolled forward off the gravel . A breeze came down off the hills , cold with the feel of the last snow up in the gullies . Even in the dark , the pine trees had a green smell . <p> " So , " said Bob , " you think your boyfriend constitutes a serious problem ? " <p> " If you 're scared , you can drop me off at the turning . " <p> " What 's the guy 's name ? " <p> " Chuckie Phelps . " <p> " I 'm not scared of anyone named Chuckie , " said Bob . He tightened his jaw . He disliked how he liked to sound tough . He was tired of all his actions and reactions . He was sick of always knowing what he would do next . <p> " You been screwing other guys ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . She gave him a quick glance , then stared straight ahead . The one light swung across the trees at the curve . They had passed no other cars . <p> " So this guy thinks you do n't love him , and he 's going to shoot himself ? Why does n't he just go out to L.A. or find himself another girl ? " <p> " He 's an artist . " She said this with some exasperation . <p> " What 's he do ? " <p> " He makes pots . " <p> " I call that a potter , not an artist , " said Bob . He began to think about L.A. Why do n't I go out there myself ? he wondered . Then he thought of his two sons . He could n't leave them , and he did n't see how he could take them . " I guess life 's just fucked up , " he said . " Your artist pal wants you , and you want more . Nothing 's ever an even fit . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the girl . Her voice was sarcastic . Bob realized she saw him as an older man . This surprised him . <p> " I do n't , " said Bob . " I 'm just making talk . " He had entered a parenthetical stretch in the middle of his day , and it felt pretty good , as if he were on vacation . He was on his way to take a gun away from a potter , and he had a dead deer in the back of his truck . <p> " What kind of gun does Chuckie have ? " asked Bob . <p> " He 's got a nine millimeter , a couple of rifles , and a twelve-gauge . " The girl was leaning against her door looking at him . <p> " Is he a religious nut or something ? " " No , he just likes guns . " " Is he dangerous ? " <p> " I never know what the hell he 's going to do . " <p> " So who 's the other guy ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Laura . " There 's just the idea of another guy . I mean , I like the idea of guys other than Chuckle . But he thinks I 'm blowing him off . I 'm sick of him trying to make me his property , so I told him to fuck himself . I said I did n't want to see him anymore . So he called me up and said he was going to shoot his head off . I told him to cut it out . Then he fired the gun right by the telephone so I could hear it . I jumped about a foot . What a jerk . " <p> " But you were going out there , " said Bob . <p> " I like him . I mean , I want it over , but I do n't want him dead . He 'd be killing himself to make me feel bad . It makes me angry even thinking about it . So I want the chance to yell at him and tell him he 's being a jerk . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung up . " <p> " So you 're going to yell at him and he 's going to wave his guns around , " said Bob . <p> Laura kicked one of the beer cans on the floor . Bob could see her white face in the dash lights . " I said you do n't have to come , " she told him . <p> But when she pointed out the road where he had to turn left , Bob slowed and swung the wheel but did n't stop . He again told himself he was n't afraid of anyone called Chuckle . Besides , what would happen if he let the girl off at the corner ? He would have to return to his own life . The kids would be asleep . Roxanne would ask where he had been , He would tell her about the deer . She would ask why he had n't been able to miss it , as if he had hit it on purpose . He could almost see how she 'd look at him , as if she had caught him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more interesting alternative . There would be clear actions that Bob could take and actions he could refuse . Bob had been married for twelve years , and it had never been easy . <p> " He 's got a red mailbox , " said Laura . " It 's about a mile up on the right . " <p> " A farm ? " <p> " A run-down place with a barn where he throws his pots . It 's a wreck , but it was cheap . " <p> " He sounds like a hippie , " said Bob . <p> " No , " said Laura , " he 's just confused . " <p> The driveway was bordered by old maples that were beginning to bud . Beyond the trees were dead-looking fields with bushes and small pines . No one had done any farming here for quite a while . The driveway was one hundred yards long , and on the left was a ragged stone wall . Bob could see a small white house . A dark Econoline van was parked in front . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on downstairs , but Bob did n't see any movement . There was a front porch and a peaked dormer over the door . The porch sagged , and the house needed paint . Wooden crates and two-by-fours and old tires littered the yard . Bob opened his door and got out . The air smelled musty and damp . Laura got out on the other side . There was still no sign of anyone . <p> Suddenly there was a rifle shot . Bob ducked behind the truck . What the hell am I doing ? he asked himself . <p> " Get out of here ! " shouted a voice . <p> " It 's me ! " called Laura . " We need to talk . " <p> " I do n't need to talk to your boyfriend , " came the voice . <p> " He 's not my boyfriend , " called Laura . " I had an accident . He 'd hit a deer , and I swerved to avoid it . " <p> Bob wondered if this made any sense to the guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " came the voice . <p> " The deer 's in the back of the truck , " said Laura . " And his truck 's banged up . Come and see . " She spoke as if to a child . <p> There was movement by the side of the house , and a heavyset man came into view . Bob guessed he was about twenty-five . In the crook of his arm he carried a rifle , maybe a .30-30 . His shoulders were hunched , and he walked slowly . He had black hair in a ponytail and wore jeans and a jean jacket . He looked like a guy who had n't heard any funny stories for a long time . Bob wondered what it would be like to be sunk that far into yourself . <p> " So who 's your friend ? " asked Chuckie , stopping about ten feet away . There was a glint of an earring in his right ear . <p> " I do n't know , " said Laura . " He 's just a guy . His name 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why does n't he come out where I can see him ? " said Chuckie . <p> Bob did n't like this , but he came out anyway . He stood near the front of the truck and hoped he could jump back if Chuckie made any move with the rifle . Bob 's knees felt funny , and he guessed his body was scared . It did n't really bother him . He had n't experienced anything interesting for a long time . <p> " You hit the deer ? " asked Chuckie . <p> " It 's right here in the truck , " said Bob . <p> " What 'd you take it for ? " asked Chuckie . <p> " I plan to cook it , " said Bob . " You got a grill ? " Even Bob was surprised at his question . He had n't known he was going to say the words until they popped out . <p> " A grill ? " asked Chuckie . <p> " Sure . So we can cook the deer . I 'll string it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We can be eating venison steaks within the hour , hot off the beast . " He hitched his thumbs in his back pockets and tried to look relaxed . <p> " Jesus Christ , " said Laura somewhere behind him . " Now I 'm stuck with two crazy guys . " <p> " You mean you want to cook it here ? " asked Chuckie , coming forward . He had n't shaved in several days , and his cheeks looked shadowy . He held the rifle loosely with one hand . <p> " Why not ? " said Bob . " You got any better plans ? " Other than shooting yourself ? he thought . " As a matter of fact , I 'm starving . " <p> " I got an outdoor grill , " said Chuckie . <p> " Well , there you are , " said Bob . " Help me string it up . " He walked to the back of the truck and let down the gate . <p> " I do n't know , " said Chuckie . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason not to play it out . " You eaten already ? " <p> Chuckie stood by the front of the truck . " No . " <p> " Then what 's the problem ? " <p> Chuckie glanced over at Laura , who was sitting Indian style on the hood . Her thick sweater made her body look like a tent . " She tell you I wanted to kill myself ? " <p> " She said something about it . How come you want to kill yourself ? " <p> " Everything 's fucked up , that 's why . " Some of the anger came back into Chuckie 's voice . <p> " So we might as well eat the deer , " said Bob . " You got any potatoes , any wine , maybe some beer ? Something for a salad ? " <p> " Let 's do it ! " said Laura , jumping down . " I like the sound of this . " <p> An hour later the deer was hanging by its rear hooves from the branch of a maple near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had turned his truck around , and the one headlight illuminated the corpse . Now it hung pink and clean with the chest cavity and belly gaping and pink intestines steaming on the ground . Bob had never gutted a deer before , but he had gutted fish and chickens and rabbits and did n't think a deer could be much different , only bigger . But pulling out the intestines had almost finished him . His clothes were blood-splattered , and his arms were bloody to the elbows . But it was all different . He was engaged in a series of actions outside the circle of criticism and complaint that dominated his life . He had cut the deer 's heart from its chest and held it in his hand . It was still warm , and the body glistened in the cool evening air . <p> Chuckie had built a fire , feeding it with logs , and he brought a big grill down from the barn . He had never gutted a deer either , nor had Laura , who was digging through the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no potatoes , but she had found macaroni , then located some pesto in the freezer . She had also found four bottles of champagne left over from Chuckie 's twenty-sixth birthday in March , and there was plenty of beer . Bob drank a Budweiser as he hauled the guts out of the deer 's belly . <p> " You got to go out to L.A. , " Bob was saying as Chuckie put more wood on the fire . " You could have a whole new life out there . Or Portland or Santa Fe or Miami . What 's the point of shooting yourself over a girl ? " <p> " It 's not just the girl , " said Chuckie . " It 's everything . " <p> Their tone was slightly joking , slightly hip . They could have been talking about cars . <p> " Sure . You got this place , you got all your stuff , but it 's not working out . So instead of selling it or leaving it , you decide to kill yourself . I bet lots of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their boxes of stuff . It 's like not wanting to pick up . Let someone else deal with it , they say . " <p> " How come you know so much about it ? " asked Chuckie . He had taken off his jacket and wore a black T-shirt . A strip of his white belly was visible over his belt buckle . <p> " I do n't , I 'm just making talk . But right now my marriage is messed up about as much as it can possibly be , so I 'm thinking Other as well . " <p> Chuckle poked the fire with a stick . A mass of sparks rose into the darkness . " What d' you mean ? " <p> " Other . Other lives , other alternatives . Something 's not working , so you think of Other . Kingston 's not working , so you think of New York or Boston or L.A. You think of other women , other jobs , other children , other cars . And you 've been thinking about the biggest Other of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick an other , I 'll pick a smaller one . Why kill myself when I can go to L.A. ? " <p> " You said you had two boys . What about them ? " <p> " They 'd prefer me in California , than dead . " <p> " What 's wrong with your wife ? " <p> " Nothing , except we had one sort of life and now she wants another and I do n't feel there 's enough room for me in the new life . She wants to be a grade-school teacher . It 's a fine profession , but I 'll take L.A. " Bob bumped against the deer , and it swung on its ropes . His nostrils felt full of the smell of smoke and bloody meat . <p> " So you think she 's choosing the teaching over you ? " <p> " It 's just change , that 's all . Is n't that why you want to shoot yourself ? To make a protest against change ? " <p> Chuckie turned back to the fire . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Things refuse to stay the same , so you 're going to refuse to move forward . " <p> " I said I do n't want to talk about it . " <p> " Or is it just Laura ? You want to hurt her and make her remember you sadly all her life ? There 's lots of girls . " <p> Chuckie turned back again . " Do n't make me mad , " he said . <p> " Yeah , you 're the guy with the guns . " Bob began slicing chunks of meat off the deer 's loins and stacking them on a tray . " You know , " he continued , " I first came up here after college . I bought a wreck of a house , fixed it up , and sold it for three times what I paid . Then I bought two houses . Soon I had five guys working for me . I did that for a few years , then I started designing houses . But sometimes I think what I really liked was going into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty . Take this place . It 's a dump , but it 's got potential . So what if we switched ? I fix this place up , and you go to Kingston and move in with my wife . We just swap lives and we get happy again . How does that sound ? " <p> " Crazy , " said Chuckie , but he was smiling . <p> " Why ? You 're not a bad guy . My wife would probably like you after a while . I could visit my kids . " <p> Chuckie scratched the bristles on his cheek . " And you 'd get Laura ? " <p> " She 's not my type , " said Bob , " but if she comes with the property , then I guess I 'd have to put up with it . " <p> " This is really crazy , " said Chuckie again , but he seemed to be thinking . <p> It seemed to Bob that people spent their time trying to make their lives unchanging , whereas change was the medium in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The deer , for instance , had other places to go . As long as one avoided death and injury , did the changes matter as much as how one responded to them ? Laura had gotten interested in other men , and so Chuckie wanted to shoot himself . Roxanne was spending all her time taking courses , and so Bob was thinking of moving out . Both were saying No . <p> " Or I could stay here with you , " said Bob . " We could become gay lovers . I 've never had a gay experience , have you ? " <p> " I do n't like that kind of stuff , " said Chuckie , letting the stubbornness back in his voice . <p> " You 're too serious , " said Bob . " I 'm just saying anything 's better than putting a bullet in your head . You need to respond with positiveness , like if we switched lives or became lovers or became missionaries in Africa . If something 's wrong with my truck , I do n't junk it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the grill . There were several dozen thick slices . Bob sprinkled them with salt and pepper . The fat hissed on the coals . Little beads of blood glistened in the light of the fire . Bob threw the cooked slices back on the tray . It made a pile bigger than they could ever eat . Chuckle carried the tray inside , and Bob followed him . Laura had set the dining room table with a white sheet and daffodils from the garden in a blue vase . The plates and dishes were also blue , and Bob realized that Chuckie had made them . There were green beans and macaroni with pesto , bread and butter . Bob set the tray in the center of the table . On a desk by the front window were Chuckie 's two rifles , a shotgun , and the nine-millimeter pistol . <p> " Your friend Bob thinks that he and I should become lovers , " said Chuckie . " Either that or I should move in with his wife . " <p> " Why not do both ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one of the bottles of champagne . There was a loud pop , and the cork shot across the room . She hurriedly poured the champagne into three wineglasses , which were also blue pottery . <p> Bob finished his beer and put the empty on the desk with the guns . He had lost track of how many he had drunk . " This is a special occasion , " he said . " We should eat naked , just take off our clothes and eat naked . " <p> Chuckie and Laura stared at him . <p> " I mean it , " said Bob . " We have this great feast . We should make it one hundred percent memorable . Stick it in our minds forever . A couple of hours ago we were all stressed out in a hundred different ways , and now we 're happy . " <p> " I 'm not completely happy , " said Chuckie . " There 's still all kinds of stuff I do n't like . " <p> " That 's because you want everything to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , eat this deer I killed , and afterward we 'll do whatever the god of change wills that we do . " He began unbuttoning his shirt . It did n't bother him to get undressed in front of them . The room was warm from the woodstove . He had entered one of life 's timeout periods , and as long as he did n't hurt anybody or get hurt himself , the rest did n't count . <p> " I do n't mind eating naked , " Laura said , then laughed . " I 've never done it before , except for snacks in bed . " She pulled off her heavy blue sweater . Underneath she wore a red bra . Bob had already removed his shirt , and he kicked off his boots . The venison was steaming on the platter atop the table . It formed the center of their circle , the hub of their wheel . The lights from the porch shone through the windows , casting the shadows of the curtains on the white walls . Laura had put four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flickered . <p> " This is crazy , " said Chuckie as he watched Laura and Bob get undressed . <p> " You keep saying that , " said Bob , " but you 're mixing up peculiarity with craziness . It 's peculiar to eat naked , but not crazy . What 's crazy is to shoot yourself . You 've got to get these things in perspective . " Bob began taking off his jeans , then took off his socks and jockey shorts . In another minute both he and Laura were standing naked . She had small breasts and hips , and Bob liked the look of her . He worried that he might get an erection ; then he did n't care if he did or did n't . Bob nodded to Chuckie . " Care to join us ? Better hurry before the meat gets cold . " <p> Chuckie looked from Bob to Laura . Being clothed in front of them was also a form of exposure . He began pulling at his black T-shirt . " Oh , I might as well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . <p> " Great , " said Bob . He stepped to the table so Chuckie would n't feel he was watching . <p> " I 've never done anything like this , " said Laura . Her voice was at the edge of laughter , almost a giggle . <p> It was a rectangular table , and she sat down across from Bob . Her bare foot brushed against Bob 's , then she moved it away . She had sharply defined shoulders , and her collarbone gleamed in the candlelight . Her breasts were slightly uneven , and her left nipple pointed away while the right one faced Bob directly . Chuckie took his place at the head of the table . He was chubby . His uncircumcised penis poked out of a mass of black pubic hair . Bob noticed an appendectomy scar . The hair on Chuckie 's chest was in tight black curls . Bob began to put his paper napkin in his lap , then stopped . Using the napkin was like wearing clothes . He did n't feel cold , but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's dig in , " said Bob . He waited as Laura took some venison , then took several slices for himself before offering the tray to Chuckle . <p> " We should say some sort of grace , " said Laura . <p> " Are you religious ? " asked Bob . <p> " Not particularly , " said Laura , " but I like that Higher Power idea they have in A.A. " <p> " We should say grace to the deer , " said Chuckle , " to the spirit of the forest . He or she made it all possible . " <p> They bowed their heads . " To the spirit of the forest , " they said in unison . Laura laughed . <p> Bob raised his glass of champagne . " To the deer , " he said . <p> Laura and Chuckie raised their glasses . " To the deer , " they repeated . <p> " I hope the deer 's spirit is watching us , " said Laura , glancing toward the window . <p> " I hope none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I wish I could call my wife and tell her what I 'm doing , " said Bob .

" asked Laura . <p> Bob could n't get over how the candlelight flickered on their nakedness , making their skin shine . Laura had turned off the kitchen light . " No , " said Bob , " she 'd think it was wacko . But maybe I 'm mistaken . I 've been so mad at her that when I imagine her doing anything or saying anything , it 's always something I think is wrong . " <p> " Too bad she 's not here , " said Laura with her mouth half full . " We could loosen her up . What 's her name ? " <p> " Roxanne , " said Bob . He wondered if she would loosen up . He wondered if perhaps he was n't the one who should loosen up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pail of water splashed on the floor . <p> The venison was moist and tender and crisp from the grill . They were silent for a moment as they ate . Laura 's breasts swung back and forth as she chewed . Chuckie 's big stomach pressed against the edge of his plate . Bob wiped the grease from his mouth with his bare arm . <p> He laughed and drank some champagne . " Is n't this better than being dead ? " <p> Chuckie grinned , then scratched the bristles on his cheek . <p> " You should call your wife , " said Laura . " Are you really going to leave her ? " <p> " I do n't know . I guess I thought if we had a fight , then the fight would make me leave her . " <p> " That does n't sound very brave , " said Chuckie . <p> " Do n't get heavy on me , Chuckie , " said Bob . " We need to tell some jokes . " <p> " Potter jokes , " said Chuckie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IQ of 150 ? " <p> " What ? " asked Laura and Bob in unison . <p> " An art school . " <p> Laura laughed and toasted Chuckie with champagne . Bob began opening the second bottle . The cork exploded across the room , and they laughed some more . <p> " I could have shot the deer with a champagne cork , " said Bob . He filled their glasses . <p> " Here 's another , " said Chuckie . " Did you hear about the potter who was also a terrorist ? He tried to blow up a bus but burned his lips on the exhaust pipe . " <p> Laura laughed again , then began to make a rasping sound in her throat . She bent forward over her plate , and her hands gripped the table . It took Bob a moment to realize she could n't breathe . Even in the candlelight he could see that her face had turned color . She looked at him , and he was startled by the fear in her eyes . Bob jumped up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . <p> " She 's choking ! " said Chuckie . He began hitting her on the back . His hand against her bare skin made a thunking sound . His penis bumped her shoulder . Laura kept choking and gagging . She knocked over her glass , and the champagne splashed across her venison . Laura 's hands were gathered at her throat as if she were strangling herself . <p> Bob shoved Chuckie out of the way and dragged Laura to her feet . Standing behind her , he linked his hands under her breastbone . Then he heaved hard . She struggled against him , still choking . He heaved again . He was afraid of breaking a rib , of giving her internal injuries . His penis was pushed against her buttocks , and Bob could feel himself getting an erection . He was shocked by this . He heaved again . <p> " Get a knife ! " he yelled at Chuckie . " I 'll have to put a hole in her throat . " He stepped away , struck Laura hard on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yanked . Chuckie ran back into the room holding a paring knife . Bob yanked back a fifth time , and the venison lodged in Laura 's throat broke free . She gasped for breath . <p> " Oh , God , " she said . Laura sat down on the floor . Bob sat beside her and put his arm over her shoulders . She put her arms around his neck and wept . Her blond hair brushed his face . <p> Chuckie stood over them , a glass of champagne in one hand , the paring knife in the other . His bare belly was like half a basketball . " She could have died , " he kept saying . " She could have died . " <p> Bob took the glass from Chuckie and drank a little . Then he gave it to Laura . She drank quickly , then coughed , then drank some more . Her left hand rested on Bob 's thigh . Chuckie sat down on the other side of her and put his head on her shoulder . " You could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the bottle of champagne and refilled the glass . Chuckie drank some too . All three were drinking from the same glass . Laura continued to weep , but she was trying to laugh as well . " I thought I was over , " she said . <p> " Are you all right ? " Bob kept asking . He recalled how he had been pressed against her . The mixture of passion , desperation , and fear still made him wonder . Laura put her arms around them , gripping their shoulders . Their heads bumped together . Bob wiped Laura 's nose with a napkin . She patted his shoulder . <p> On the wall Bob saw the shadows of the dining room curtains being blown in the breeze from the window . They seemed to follow a pattern , but he could understand no pattern . They jumped and leapt about . They moved as in a dance , like creatures trapped by the music to which they listened . It had significance yet also seemed without significance . Bob could n't stop looking at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of movement , this kind of shadow on a wall , would recall that evening at Chuckie 's farm . Briefly , Bob would feel himself sitting on the floor again with his bare skin against Laura 's . He could almost feel her warmth . Bob would see the curtains twisting . He would remember how he had felt at the very edge of some important articulation , and then it slipped by . They had gotten to their feet . They had drunk more champagne . The world had begun to reassert itself . Soon they had gotten dressed . They grinned sheepishly and spoke of how much they had drunk . <p> Over the next few months Bob had seen Chuckie several times , but he had n't seen the girl again . He did n't forget Chuckie 's name ; it was too boyish to forget . But in later years he could n't remember if the girl 's name had been Laura or Lauren . He would ask Roxanne , but she had forgotten as well . They had stayed married , though Bob could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . The defining word Bob used to himself was priorities . And that too was because of the dinner at Chuckie 's farm . It had helped him to be clear about his priorities , though he found it hard to say exactly what that meant . <p> But the evening began to recede in his memory . What Bob recalled most clearly was how the girl 's breasts had pointed in slightly different directions and how her face had turned blue . And he remembered how warm her skin had felt . " In any case , " he would say when he and Roxanne went out with new people for dinner , " she was the one who nearly died . Not the guy who wanted to shoot himself , not Chuckie . " It was a way of making sense of the surprise , the sudden change in the evening 's direction , or what he had thought had been its direction . Then he would remember the shadows of the curtains on the walls , like a message rendered in a language of which he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as the evening continued to recede into memory there came a time when even those shadows had vanished . <p> <p> By STEPHEN DOBYNS <p>
