If you wanted to question whether global warming is indeed upon us , last week was not the time to do it . Two weeks before the official beginning of summer , a heat wave baked the eastern third of the U.S. and Canada , driving temperatures high into the 90s and even 100s . At the same time , a flurry of scientific papers was released that seemed to explain all the late-spring suffering . In one study , French researchers reported that heat-trapping greenhouse gases are at their highest levels in 420,000 years . In another , U.S. scientists found that 57 species of butterfly may be altering their migratory patterns in response to changing heat patterns . <P> In light of all this , a sweltering public must have been convinced at last that it 's time to do something to cool off the overheated planet , right ? Wrong . Even as the temperature was climbing , a new survey by the American Geophysical Union found that Americans are less concerned than ever about combatting global warming . " The more we talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Immerwahr , " the more the public 's concern goes down . " <P> Such an environmental disconnect may not be much of a mystery . Environmentalists complain that over the past two years industry groups have launched a coordinated advertising campaign to torpedo the 1997 Kyoto treaty , which requires industrial nations to reduce greenhouse emissions . More than $13 million has been spent on ads to block ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate . " The purpose of the ads was to convince most Americans that there is n't a problem or that it 's too expensive to fix , " says National Environmental Trust spokesman Peter Kelly . <P> Environmentalists also criticize President Clinton for what they believe is his failure to press the issue . Only last week , Clinton moved for Kyoto treaty changes that environmental groups see as industry-pleasing loopholes . Says Daniel Weiss , the Sierra Club 's political director : " Timid leaders communicate hopelessness . " And hopelessness breeds indifference . <P> If such popular so-whating persists , Immerwahr warns , the public may begin grasping at phony solutions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some people took comfort from the report of a vast haze of pollutants that collects over the Indian Ocean in the winter , but that researchers only recently studied . Filthy as the cloud is , it does deflect solar radiation , and that could lead to cooling . But scientists warn that we can not simply pollute our way out of global warming . The soot drops from the hazy atmosphere in weeks , whereas greenhouse gases remain for centuries . <P> The way out of this gridlock , environmentalists say , is to show it 's possible to reduce greenhouse gases without sinking the economy . Solutions include cleaner cars and better wind- and solar-power technologies . Says Greg Wetstone , program director for the Natural Resources Defense Council : " When these kinds of options become available , people will feel less hopeless . " Of course , it 's also possible that only when people feel less hopeless will they press their leaders to make the solutions available . <P>  --  By Dick Thompson              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
