Six days of pampered living while touring the Champagne District of France on the canal barge Meanderer . Photograph Photograph // Every voyage should begin comme , ca : I held the crystal tulip to the light and watched bubbles stream upward and explode into ethereal foam . In my other hand , I held , with equal finesse , a delectable quail 's egg . I lowered the glass and sipped , watching the Marne River glide beneath a medieval wall on the opposite quay where young sycamores grew and old lovers touched on a wooden bench . We-my wife , Robyn and I and our fellow guests-were standing on the weather deck of the canal barge Meanderer in the Paris suburb of Lagny . It was a deliciously hot July afternoon . We were at the outset of what would be a long , slow , embracing crawl into the heart of the Isle de France , ultimately exploring the visible spirit of this nation , which I now savored : Champagne .

Rounding the first bend on our generally east-northeasterly course , we entered our first lock at the village of Chalifert and very shortly thereafter , ducked into a tunnel that fed into the Canal de Meaux a Chalifert , the canal that circumvents a lazy , shallow section of the river . We no sooner emerged than we locked through again , the chamber flanked by fir and pollarded locust , the lockkeeper 's house adorned with brilliant geraniums . Fishermen graced the verge with the dour expressions of the luckless . Our fortunes were quite different . Already , the tone for the entire voyage has been set .
