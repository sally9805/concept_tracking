The FBI is thinking about restoring the famed tommy gun of the 1930s to active inventory . Memorialized in gangster movies and in TV 's The Untouchables , the Thompson submachine gun , it turns out , can still outmatch some of its modern successors : one of its .45-cal. slugs , spewed out at a rate of up to 800 rounds a minute , will knock down even the biggest bad guy .
