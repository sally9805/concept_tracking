The eclipse of economics <p> ' I want to keep our prosperity going , " said Al Gore in his June announcement speech , " and I know how to do it . " He also promises to make the economy " fairer . " <p> Some may detect a certain hubris here-though Gore at least did n't claim to have invented the economy . He has a wonderful knack for reversing the truth , as when , on Impeachment Day , he proclaimed Bill Clinton a " great president , " or when he mistranslated e pluribus unum " out of one , many . " His latest claim comes at the moment when , for the first time in decades , neither party has anything resembling a true economic policy . <p> Each party , of course , continues to have policies that it defends on economic grounds ( such as free trade ) or that will have effects on the economy ( such as increasing the minimum wage ) . But there was a time when the parties also had a policy on the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 70s , Washington pursued a policy of stabilizing the economy with Keynesian economics , running deficits to stimulate the economy during recessions and surpluses to cool it down during booms . Deficits were , of course , easier for politicians to deliver than surpluses , but the theoretical consensus was strong and bipartisan , as evidenced by Richard Nixon 's famous 1971 remark , " We are all Keynesians now . " At the high tide of Keynesianism , its believers imagined that they could " fine tune " the economy so as to avoid any major ups and downs . <p> This consensus was upended by the " stagflation " of the ' 70s : Policymakers confronting a recession and inflation simultaneously did n't know whether to step on the brakes or the accelerator . ( Note the machine-age metaphor , always misleading and now almost comically out of date . ) At the same time , intellectual developments such as monetarism , rational-expectations theory , and supply-side economics challenged the Keynesian consensus . So the parties developed new economic policies , with Republicans promoting tax cuts and tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government would use subsidies to protect America 's manufacturing base . By the early 1990s , industrial policy had morphed into " public investment " : The government would increase the economy 's productive powers by spending more on education , child care , mass transit , and the like . <p> The turning point for both parties came in 1993 , when the public-investment crowd lost out to the deficit reducers within the Clinton administration . Bill Clinton decided to attack the deficit by raising taxes . But while a Keynesian might have done this to cool off an overheating economy , Clinton argued that reducing the deficit would actually stimulate a recovering economy by bringing interest rates down . That Clinton 's tax increases had this effect is still the official wisdom in Washington . <p> In our new post-deficit era , both parties have agreed to continue on autopilot , which means using surpluses to pay down the national debt . But this is more a budget policy than an economic one . It was adopted without any intellectual groundwork . The supply-siders were mocked for having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the debt reductionists are blank . Clinton merely stumbled into the policy for political reasons . The economic glosses on debt repayment contradict each other : It 's supposed to stimulate the economy , presumably through lower interest rates , but it 's also supposed to cool it down . Hence the complaints that Republican tax cuts would dangerously overheat the economy . <p> If Republicans do n't have good answers to this critique , it 's because they too have lost sight of economics . Their mistake was to overstate the case against Clinton 's tax increases in 1993 . Instead of predicting that his bill would reduce growth , cause some women and older men in upper-income households to stop working , and depress savings rates-all of which indeed resulted-they said that it would plunge the economy into a recession . When this did n't happen , and the economy after a few years of subpar growth started chugging along , Republicans were embarrassed ( as much as politicians get , anyway ) and , more important , left with nothing to say . <p> Next , Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they took over Congress in 1995 . They did this less because it made any economic sense than because it held their factions together : Perot-style populists and good-government types thought balancing the books was important in its own right , while conservatives thought they could cut government in the name of cutting deficits . All of a sudden , Republicans were echoing Clinton 's claims about deficits and interest rates and forgetting what they had said from the early 1980s until just two years before ( that deficits have a negligible effect on interest rates ) . Once again , economics was subordinated to budget policy . <p> At the same time , the conservative intelligentsia was losing interest in economics . Here the crucial development was the loss of faith in Jack Kemp . Conservatives grew disenchanted with him for many reasons , but one of the most important was the sense that he placed too much emphasis on economics . He believed , so the indictment ran , in Homo economicus , the rational economic calculator found only in academic models , and ignored the role of culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion that enterprise zones and deregulation could rescue the inner cities . <p> They argued ( rightly ) that the nation 's most pressing problems were not economic but moral , cultural , and spiritual-a point that has become all the stronger the more prosperous Americans have felt . As George W. Bush put it in a speech to lunchgoers at the Manhattan Institute in October , " Too often , my party has focused on the national economy , to the exclusion of all else-speaking a sterile language of rates and numbers , of CBO this and GNP that . Of course we want growth and vigor in our economy . But there are human problems that persist in the shadow of affluence . " Bush 's remarks represented ( as they often do ) the solidification of a Republican consensus . <p> The supply-siders ' counterattack-beginning , again , roughly five years ago-was doomed by its own rigidity . They attacked social-conservative initiatives , such as the $500 child tax credit and marriage-penalty relief , as distractions from the campaign for a reduction in marginal tax rates . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to raise revenue for the government while doing the least harm to the economy . Any departure from this ideal they criticized as " social engineering . " But why should n't policymakers also try to mitigate the harm done by taxes to families ? The tax burden on families has increased for decades , as inflation ate away the personal exemption ; the child tax credit only began to undo the damage . And the supply-siders ' main criticism of marriage-penalty relief was that it cost too much in revenues that should have gone to other tax cuts-the sort of zero-sum , **27;1162;TOOLONG thinking that they usually oppose . <p> Not content merely to attack their allies , supply-siders walked into a cul-de-sac of their own . Tax reform replaced tax cuts as their rallying cry . Here was an economist 's dream : the chance to devise a new tax code from scratch on the basis of principle , with no concessions to interest groups , liberal tinkerers , or even public sentiment . But a dream is not a policy , and politicians were happy to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax code for their friends . Republicans thus oscillated wildly between grand abstractions and low deals , with voters in the dark about what they stood for . <p> And this is , more or less , the situation today . Nobody in Congress any longer plays the role in developing a Republican economic policy that Bob Kasten , Jack Kemp , or Vin Weber once did . Dick Armey and Phil Gramm are academic economists , but the former has his hands full running the House , and the latter concentrates more on tactics than on vision . Bill Archer crafted a pro-growth tax bill , but he 's retiring from the House . Perhaps freshman congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin will emerge as a supply-side leader for the next generation . Meanwhile , supply-siders such as ( National Review 's ) Lawrence Kudlow are hoping that if Republicans take the White House , the next administration will build on the foundation laid by Archer ( perhaps naming Archer Treasury secretary ? ) . <p> It 's not yet clear what Bush 's economic policy is going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best be described as a fine-tuning supply-sider . Where pure supply-siders favor cutting tax rates permanently , to improve incentives and thus raise the long-term rate of economic growth , Lindsey would cut rates temporarily , to give a jolt to a weakening economy . ( Lindsey has been an economic pessimist for the last four years . ) Unlike most supply-siders , Lindsey balks at tax cuts that appear to favor capital . This may be a political judgment based on an outdated view of workers , many of whom are now accumulating capital themselves . Or it may be a point of principle : Lindsey has recently been quoted as objecting to Steve Forbes 's flat tax because it does n't tax capital . ( This is , strictly speaking , not true : Forbes would tax capital , but not multiple times , as the current tax code does . ) <p> Missouri Republican Jim Talent argues that the lack of focus on economic policy reflects a healthy perspective on the power of politicians : " There 's been a general reevaluation of the relative importance of monetary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's not nearly as important to cut marginal tax rates as it was 20 years ago , when they were punitive . We may now , however , be ascribing too much importance to the Federal Reserve . On the stump in Iowa , Forbes has been blaming low farm prices on Alan Greenspan 's tight-money policies . Actually , farm prices have been falling for centuries ; this is not only the result of civilizational advance , but a prime component of it . Conducting monetary policy by reference to the price of corn is a peculiar idea-especially coming from Forbes , one of the few currently prominent Republicans who still has a well-thought-out economic worldview . <p> Before he dropped out of the presidential race , Dan Quayle , too , took up the anti-Greenspan line . There is a legitimate case against Greenspan , particularly against his suggestions that the economy and stock market might be doing too well . But the criticism of Greenspan raises a political dilemma for conservatives : Until now , they have been saying that Greenspan , rather than Clinton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Greenspan , they will have to find a new line-or change the subject . Gov . Bush promises " prosperity with a purpose , " seemingly conceding that Gore does in fact know how to deliver prosperity , but suggesting that this is no great accomplishment . <p> Political risks aside , the lack of an economic policy may not be such a bad thing . It made sense for conservative intellectuals to shift their gaze from economics to the culture of poverty , national character , and other topics . In the current economic environment , it makes sense to focus on tax cuts that promote social rather than economic goals-such as cuts that make it easier to save for college or health care . Maybe a revival of economic policy can await the next recession . <p> But ideas do n't come out of the blue when serious trouble strikes ; generally , they have been germinating for some time . The danger posed by the intellectual disarray regarding economics is that the next time we 're in a crunch , our political elites will have no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more dependent on dumb luck than is comfortable to think . <p> By Ramesh Ponnuru <p>
