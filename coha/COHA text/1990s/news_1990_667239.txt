<p> Don Johnson sits inside his big silver air-conditioned bus/dressing room in a deserted area downtown . <p> The Miami Vice fashion icon is gone , except for the familiar cigarette in hand . Instead , Johnson is a shaggy cowboy - long beard and mustache and ragged hair to his collar . He 's wearing faded jeans , a bandana around his neck and cowboy boots held together with duct tape . <p> " I love you , too , darlin , ' " he coos , grinning into the phone . His Oscar- nominated wife , Melanie Griffith , is in London filming a movie with Michael Douglas . It 's the first time they 've been separated since they married each other - for the second time - in 1989 . <p> " It 's for real , " Johnson says . " We love each other 's company . Out of everything I consider an accomplishment , that is the golden ring , if you 'll pardon the play on words . " <p> Summoned to the set of Harley Davidson and the Marlboro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasoline is $ 3.99 a gallon ) , Johnson hops in a waiting van . ( It takes him all of about 50 feet , but , hey , he 's a star , right ? ) <p> He 's attentive , attractive and gets remotely testy only once - when someone says he 's needed for a scene . " I 'm ready ! " he answers . " I 'm waiting on Mickey ! " <p> In Harley , to be released next summer , Johnson plays Marlboro , a cowboy drifter , and the realist of the two . Mickey Rourke plays a drifter , too , named Harley Davidson ( " It 's not just a motorcycle . It 's a way of life , " his character says ) . He 's the idealist . <p> Off-camera , " Don prepares meticulously . Mickey will turn on his instincts , " says director Simon Wincer , who most recently finished Quigley Down Under with Tom Selleck . <p> When he first thought about working with Johnson and Rourke , two men with reputations for volatile tempers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Rourke , 40 , has long been labeled a non-conformist in Hollywood . And although his movies do well in Europe , the bad attitude he has been tagged with has n't helped his U.S. success . It 's a moniker he 's proud of , but one that has cost him . <p> " I have choices to make but due to what my reputation is , I have very little . But I would rather have very little choices and keep my own dignity than ever kiss anybody 's ( rump ) ... . " <p> He took this movie , he says , because he was broke . <p> " I had a house I was building and I ran out of money . And I had a divorce I was paying off . And I 've been doing some movies in Europe that have n't had good luck getting distributed in the States ... . So I had to do this for economic reasons . " <p> Despite steady work - Wild Orchid , 91/2 Weeks , Barfly - he says it 's his nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it . " <p> Johnson is the antithesis . He has turned his Vice success into homes in Aspen , Los Angeles and Miami . He has a family . But he , too , is still remembered more for his final Miami Vice days - and his image as a demanding prima donna - than the few movies he 's done since . " There have been times in my career when I have not been an angel ; I have been difficult , ... " he admits . But , " Never had so many unkind and untrue things been written about one person and one show , " he says , recalling the last Vice season . " There were n't the feuds and fights everyone talked about . " <p> But Wincer says , before he 's even asked , " They 've both been an utter delight . I can certainly dispel rumors of either of them being difficult . " <p> Rourke and Johnson are friends , but not close friends , it seems . They met 13 years ago in the fishing tackle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a recovering alcoholic , says they did go to a " couple of watering holes " together when they were filming in Arizona two weeks earlier " just to confirm the rumors that we were in town . <p> " One of the funniest things that happened in Tucson was the sound man was named Don Johnson , so daily ... he would bring me mail and phone messages from his hotel room , because I was staying in a house . He said , ' Listen , can I take the overflow ? ' I said , ' Pal , you can have it all . I guess you 've heard - I 'm out of action . ' " <p> On this day , there 's not a lot of goofing around on the set . Rourke and Johnson chuckle about something when they 're through with a scene , but when asked about it later , Johnson does n't even remember what it was that made them laugh . During a break , Rourke nurses a migraine in his trailer and everyone says he 's not happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark inside - the light is too painful . He 's wearing the one outfit he wears throughout the movie - an orange and black leather jacket and pants . His hair is short and spiky ; he is tan and clean looking . " It 's a new look , " says his makeup artist Ed Terns . " It shows some vulnerability . " <p> Rourke rides his own motorcycle in the movie - it 's a bike he has been working on two years , he says . But he 's been riding a lot longer than that . <p> " It 's kinda gotten real trendy in L.A. to ride , so there are some days I do n't do it , just for that reason . You know , when I first started riding with my brother here eight years ago , nobody rode , now it 's really kinda sickening all the ( jerks ) you see on bikes , " says Rourke , and then asks his manager - who 's in the back of the bus - to bring him a cigarette . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . And he means it . He loathes the Hollywood politicking so much that it prompts the question : Then why not do something else ? <p> " If I could do something else where I made as much money , yeah , sure , I would . " <p> He admits he has n't always been this bitter . " I liked ( acting ) when I did n't quite know so much about the politics of the industry . Then , it was something I could respect . I was very naive . " <p> Now , he says , " This business is about how much money you can make at the box office . That 's what the game becomes - even your worth is based on how much money your last picture made . Not how well your acting ability is . " <p> That 's partly why he does n't , as a rule , do interviews . " People do n't like to hear what I have to say . " <p> Conversely , the mood in Johnson 's bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even on the eve of his 41st birthday . <p> " Wan na see some sexy pictures ? " Johnson asks with that grin . " They 're porno , " he teases , making his publicist nervous . Not to worry . The pictures he shows are promotional movie shots of himself - shirt off , jeans on - in front of a big motorcycle . <p> He 's even more proud of the photos of his angelic-looking baby Dakota , his only child with Griffith . " Not just because I 'm her father , " says Johnson of Dakota , " but she is a stone-cold knockout . " No acting for her , says Daddy . <p> " They do n't have acting in convents , " he jokes . " They do n't have movies . They have prayer . " <p> Cracks like that make him hard to figure : Sex symbol or devoted dad , which is he ? <p> Johnson thinks for a minute . " Leave it multiple choice . " CUTLINE : DOUBLE TAKE : Mickey Rourke , left , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of futuristic drifters in ' Harley Davidson and The Marlboro Man , ' a pairing that director Simon Wincer at first found ' a fairly daunting combination .
