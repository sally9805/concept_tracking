<p> With its belching smokestacks and daunting urban problems , Northwest Indiana symbolizes , for many Chicagoans , the old Midwest rust belt  --  an image reinforced by the current effort to build a stadium for the Chicago Bears on an old industrial dump in Gary . <p> But a closer look at the area around Gary , including Lake and Porter counties , reveals much more than toxic waste and obsolete factories : Northwest Indiana has a fundamentally sound and diverse economy that has largely recovered from wrenching cutbacks in the core steel industry during the 1980s . <p> It is a region divided into two economies  --  the fast-growing suburbs , and Gary , a city that has lost 50,000 residents in the last 15 years and has a crime problem so severe that the Indiana State Police were called in to keep order . Indiana began phasing out the troopers this month after Gary posted a 16 percent drop in violent crime . <p> Outside Gary , Northwest Indiana claims a relatively low jobless rate of less than 5 percent , with prosperity evident in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acres and Sand Creek and the frenetic pace of retail development along U.S. 30 south of Gary . The number of retail establishments in Merrillville and Schererville increased from 372 in 1982 to 499 in 1992 , up 33 percent . <p> Moreover , the region is a formidable competitor in the high-stakes game of economic development . And while Mayor Daley and the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce loudly bemoan the prospect of losing the Bears to Gary , they have been silent while Northwest Indiana has quietly lured across dozens of growing businesses in recent years . <p> " We do n't even have to prospect , " said Thomas M. McDermott , president of the Northwest Indiana Forum , the same group leading the effort to develop the $ 500 million entertainment complex anchored by the Bears . " We get calls and letters from businesses in Illinois every week . " <p> Many of these companies have low profiles but generate a lot of good jobs . <p> Robert Potter , director of manufacturing for PSW Industries Inc. , a Chicago-based manufacturer of electric motor parts , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't find a location without toxic contamination . <p> " We started a search in Northwest Indiana and found that the tax structure was more reasonable , the training grants were exceptional , and wage structure is a bit less than in Chicago . Plus , they have trees and schools , something they do n't have here , " Potter said . <p> Although its headquarters remains in Chicago , PSW last year located a plant in Michigan City that is expected to employ 120 by next year . <p> Altogether , Northwest Indiana has added about 2,000 jobs in the last four years from Illinois companies that have relocated or opened operations across the state line , said Mark McGlaughlin , vice president of economic development for the Northwest Indiana Forum . <p> Jim Graham , deputy director for business development at the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs , denied that Illinois companies are moving across the border . He said Illinois has a net gain in jobs competing against Indiana , citing several companies such as National Tube &; Supply Co. that moved from Northwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about pursuing business , but so are we , " Graham said . <p> In any event , Indiana 's economic development strategy has been simple and effective : It offers business and living costs far lower than in Illinois , with virtually the same high-quality transportation and infrastructure that Chicago offers . <p> One tactic used by the Northwest Indiana Forum is to distribute a " tax comparison study " by Chicago Southland , a rival business group that has campaigned for reduced property taxes . It notes that workers compensation costs and real estate taxes are far lower in Indiana 's Lake County than in Cook County . <p> The result : A small company with $ 1 million in sales can reduce its taxation and costs by about 30 percent simply by moving from Cook County to Indiana , the Chicago Southland report said . <p> But Indiana is no longer content with such nuts-and-bolts growth , as illustrated by the effort to develop Planet Park , the proposed new home of the Bears . On top of that , Gary will welcome a Donald Trump riverboat casino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of developing a multibillion-dollar theme park centered around the childhood home of pop superstar Michael Jackson . <p> The idea is to jazz up Northwest Indiana 's dowdy , blue-collar reputation , in hopes that Gary can overcome its economic problems by becoming an entertainment destination . <p> " Our image has taken a real beating , and bringing the Bears here would do a lot to overcome that , " said Richard Hatcher , mayor of Gary from 1968 to 1988 . " An entertainment park could generate other kinds of investment in the city and could be substantial in terms of producing jobs . " <p> But the actual economic impact of hosting 11 Bears games a year appears minimal . And some doubt that Gary can justify levying a proposed 0.5 percent personal income tax increase to help pay for the $ 500 million stadium complex , or that the region would be better off after subsidizing an Atlantic City-style entertainment complex . <p> " Is that stadium a catalyst for economic growth in Gary ? Not at all , " said Allen Sanderson , a professor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . " It 's going to make a few people better off  --  real estate developers , contractors , ( Bears owner Mike ) McCaskey , the players , the people that issue the bonds  --  but taxpayers as a whole are going to be worse off . The benefits of that relocation , should it occur , will be captured by a small set of people . " <p> Others doubt that the Bears would help attract other businesses to Northwest Indiana  --  a key factor cited by proponents of Planet Park . <p> " It may help Gary in terms of image , but I do n't think it will have a significant impact on the location of businesses that are n't directly related to sports , " said Robert Ady , president of PHH Phantus , a site-selection consulting firm in Chicago . " I 've never had a client ask to locate in a city because of a pro sports team . " <p> McDermott said that more than half of the projected $ 30 million raised from the increased income tax would go toward other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park . <p> But it 's possible Planet Park might actually hinder Gary 's economic development . That 's because the extra income tax would mean an extra $ 150 a year taken from the paychecks of Lake County residents who earn $ 30,000 . Lake County residents now pay 3.4 percent in income taxes , slightly higher than the 3 percent rate in Cook County . <p> That additional burden could deter some businesses or residents from locating in Lake County . <p> Rather than boosting its tax rate on behalf of one high-profile tenant , Northwest Indiana might be better off sticking to a no-frills and more evenhanded approach to attracting business . <p> Certainly , the area has come a long way since the mid-1980s . Gary , home of U.S. Steel 's biggest factory , suffered badly from the Midwest manufacturing shakeout . Since 1980 , U.S. Steel 's payroll at Gary has plummeted from 25,000 to 7,800 . Over the last 12 years , the factory spent $ 1.5 billion automating and upgrading its manufacturing processes . Now the factory makes more steel than in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Losing that many jobs for a city like Gary was like a knife to the heart , " Hatcher said . <p> Many residents gave up and left . Gary 's population plummeted from 187,000 in 1980 to 115,000 in 1990 . Said Hatcher : " Gary had its dollars drained , and it created a situation where if a person wants to buy a toothbrush , you have to go down on ( U.S. ) 30 outside the city to buy it . " <p> Gary 's suburbs also lost residents as many young people moved elsewhere to look for jobs , but in recent years nearby towns such as Merrillville have become a magnet for retail development . And in bedroom communities along the lake , including the eastern part of Gary , property values have soared as Chicago residents moved southeast , sparking a housing boom . <p> " You really feel like you 've gone somewhere different , " said Terry Grimm of his lakefront home in Porter County . A lawyer for Winston &; Strawn in the Loop , Grimm also owns a condominium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time with his family at the Dune Acres community in Indiana . <p> And dozens of nuts-and-bolts businesses have expanded into Northwest Indiana as part of the Midwest manufacturing recovery . Midwest Fastener Corp .  --  which actually makes screws and bolts  --  outgrew its operations in Illinois and recently moved a 75-employee plant to Valparaiso , southeast of Gary , because of the area 's good transportation and low taxes . " They welcomed us with open arms , " said Lee Loudermilk , Midwest 's president . <p> Even Gary has recruited its share of business , mostly manufacturers , lowering the city 's industrial vacancy rate to near zero . And despite the area 's extensive brownfields and Superfund sites , the situation is improving : Fish have started to swim again in the once-dead Grand Calumet River , and a newly elected mayor has outlined a program to clean up the city 's many contaminated industrial sites . <p> Though easily overlooked , a few companies like Midwest Fastener contribute more to the area 's economy than the Chicago Bears . " What matters is a well-thought-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sanderson said . " Putting various forms of amusement in there is n't going to make a big difference for Gary , and there are certainly better ways of spending $ 500 million . " @x Sadie Louise Bernier of Seattle is 7 months old , but her parents are already showing her little things everyone can do to protect the environment . " We 're leaving your room now , darling , and we 're turning off the lights , " says her mother , Kim Rakow Bernier . Then she 'll point out the window and say , " There 's Daddy getting on his bicycle to go to the office . " As outreach director for Facing the Future , a sustainability education organization , Kim says that modeling caring-about-the-planet behavior for her daughter is " almost unconscious , " since " this is what we do as a family anyway . " But it 's indicative of the fact that , while high schools and colleges have included ecology and the environment in their curricula for years , conversations about environmental consciousness in general and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindergarten , and sometimes even younger . The children 's section at Barnes and Noble , for instance , offers new books from Nickelodeon 's Big Green Help series ( published on recycled paper ) , with titles like SpongeBob Goes Green ! and Save the Tree ! And for the 2-year-old-and-up set , there 's Choose to Reuse ! ( a green touch-and-feel book ) . " There is no question there is a much bigger demand for climate change education materials than there was , say , five years ago , " says Jim Elder , director of the Campaign for Environmental Literacy . Al Gore 's An Inconvenient Truth , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 's 2007 prediction that global temperatures could rise 8 degrees by the end of the century , and extreme weather events such as Hurricane Katrina have spurred wider recognition of the validity of the idea that climate change is induced by humans . A dozen or so states require environmental education to be taught in grades K-12 , and that number is growing , says Elder , with Maryland , California , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For environmental educators , the trend is more than welcome . In a 2006 Hamilton College Climate Change and Environment Issues Youth Poll , 50 percent of the 900 high school students surveyed flunked a nine-question quiz on the causes and consequences of climate change . But the survey also found that students who discuss environmental issues with their friends and family are more likely to engage in environmentally conscious behavior . To help jump-start educational efforts at all levels , in and out of school , Eban Goodstein , codirector of National Teach-In on Global Warming Solutions , recruited 804 institutions and about 250,000 people , including students of all ages , to participate in a nationwide " day of engagement " on February 5 . As part of the day 's events , students across the country were able to participate in live videoconferences with about a dozen members of Congress . Goodstein 's target audience is specifically young people because he views them as " the decisive human generation . " Young people " have a truly heroic task that they have no choice but to fulfill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an economics professor at Lewis and Clark College . " The task is saving the planet as we know it , so that their children can also inherit a beautiful and rich planet . " Such calls to action may help energize older students . But educators warn that very young children may be frightened if global warming is described in terms too dire . With them , it 's better to focus on small , practical actions , like turning off lights or not wasting water , so they do n't feel overwhelmed and overburdened , says Kevin Coyle , vice president for education at the National Wildlife Federation . " Starting in fifth and sixth grades , I see kids beginning to grasp issues at a level closer to adults and asking serious questions and having serious concerns about what this means for their own future , " says Tim Bombaci , a sixth-grade science and math teacher at Manson Elementary School in Manson , Wash . Bombaci just received a grant to further develop a community garden , a project that helps students learn about the full cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth through sixth graders will do most of the digging and planting , he envisions earlier grades observing or helping out . And it could be these fourth through sixth graders , armed with their new knowledge of conservation , who end up battling climate change in a decade or two .
