Within days a New York publisher will ship 27,000 copies of its latest release to bookstores across the country . Along with this merchandise will arrive advertising posters  --  de rigueur in these hard-marketing times  --  bearing a reproduction of the book 's dust- jacket cover and 10,000 audiotapes of an unabridged reading of the words inside . Nothing particularly unusual about all this , except that the contents of the book in question have been around , in one form or another , for about 2,700 years . <P> How to explain the promotional muscle being flexed behind yet another translation of Homer 's Odyssey , this one provided by Princeton professor Robert Fagles ( Viking ; 541 pages ; $35 ) ? Why expect people to pay $45 for a boxed set of tapes ( issued by Penguin Audiobooks ) on which the British actor Ian McKellen reads the text of Fagles ' translation over a listening time of some 13 hours ? <P> The principal reason seems to rest on precedent . The Fagles translation of Homer 's Iliad , published by Viking in 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , went on to exceed all commercial expectations by selling 22,000 copies in hardback ; the paperback version , now in its eighth printing , has moved 140,000 copies . And an abridged audiotape of the Iliad read by Derek Jacobi surprised Penguin Audiobooks by selling 35,000 copies . <P> What can fairly be called the Fagles phenomenon forms an intriguing new chapter in the long saga of efforts to knead Homeric Greek into suitable English . The first translator with access to the Greek texts and the gumption to try his hand at them was George Chapman ( circa 1560-1634 ) , whose complete version of the Iliad in English appeared in 1611 , the same year that saw the release of the King James Version of the Old and New Testaments . <P> The King James Version , thanks to its felicities of language and the imprimatur of the Church of England , ruled supreme and largely unchallenged among English-speaking Christians for about 350 years . Chapman 's Homer , a redaction of the secular words of a pagan bard , naturally received no such binding spiritual and temporal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  see Keats ' sonnet On First Looking into Chapman 's Homer  --  and challenging enough to provoke competing versions . Since Chapman , nearly four centuries ' worth of British and , later , American writers have taken on Homer . <P> Robert Fagles , 63 , has been teaching literature at Princeton since 1960 . It was only after translating tragedies by Aeschylus and Sophocles that he began to consider " climbing back to the source " of Greek legends and taking on the herculean tasks of the Iliad and the Odyssey . Fagles knows that well-stocked bookstores will display plenty of competition for his forthcoming Odyssey , including the highly regarded verse renditions of Robert Fitzgerald ( 1961 ) and Richmond Lattimore ( 1965 ) . But , says Fagles , " every generation needs a new translation of Homer . He was a performer , and he can be re-performed. "
