The Accordion Maker The instrument It was as if his eye were an ear and a crackle went through it each time he shot a look at the accordion . The instrument rested on the bench , lacquer gleaming like wet sap . Rivulets of light washed mother-of-pearl , the nineteen polished bone buttons , winked a pair of small oval mirrors rimmed in black paint , eyes seeking eyes , seeking the poisonous stare of anyone who possessed malocchio , eager to reflect the bitter glance back at the glancer . He had cut the grille with a jeweler 's saw from a sheet of brass , worked a design of peacocks and olive leaves . The hasps and escutcheons that fastened the bellows frames to the case ends , the brass screws , the zinc reed plate , the delicate axle , the reeds themselves , of steel , and the aged Circassian walnut for the case , he had purchased all of these . But he had constructed and fashioned the rest : the V-shaped wire springs with their curled eyes that lay under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamping fingers , the buttons , the palette rods . The trenched bellows , the leather valves and gaskets , the skived kidskin gussets , the palette covers , all of these were from a kid whose throat he had cut , whose hide he had tanned with ash lime , brains and tallow . The bellows had eighteen folds . The wood parts , of obdurate walnut to resist damp and warpage , he had sawed and sanded and fitted , inhaling the mephitic dust . The case , once glued up , rested for six weeks before he proceeded . He was not interested in making ordinary accordions . He had his theory , his idea of the fine instrument ; with the proof of this one he planned to make hisfortune in La Merica . He set the fourths and then the fifths with a tuning fork and his naked ear , catching an aching but pleasurable dissonance . His sense of pitch was sure , he heard harmonies in the groan of hinges . The button action was quick , the subtle clacking like the rattle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice of the instrument sounded hoarse and crying , reminding listeners of the brutalities of love , of various hungers . The notes fell , biting and sharp ; it seemed the tooth that bit was hollowed with pain . The world is a staircase The accordion maker was hairy and muscular , a swell of black hair rising above a handsome face , an ear like a pastry circle . His irises were an amber color : in his youth he suffered the name " Chicken Eye . " When he was twenty he had defied his blacksmith father and left the village to work in the north in the accordion factories of Castelfidardo . His father cursed him and they never spoke again . He returned to the village when Alba , his betrothed , sent news of the opportunity to rent a plot of land with a handkerchief vineyard and miniature house . He was glad to leave the city for he was embroiled in a dangerous affair with a married woman . His hairiness drew women 's attention . From time to time in their marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several . Accordions and hair drew women , could he help this ? She knew it  --  his gift for music had attracted her powerfully , his silky pelt , the hair curling from the throat of his shirt . He took chills easily , shivered when the sun passed behind a cloud . His wife was warm and it was possible to stand close to her and feel the heat that radiated from her as from a little stove . Her hands seized children , plates , chicken feathers , goats ' teats with the same hot grasp . The rented vines , Calabrese , Negro d'Avola , Spagnolo , made a harsh wine without name , sold as a blending wine to foreigners . It was the local custom to hold the fermenting must on the skins for a week , the source of the wine 's rough character and purple-black color . Swallowed straight down , it raked mouth and throat and , as other astringent liquids , was reputed to have beneficial medicinal qualities . The foreign buyers paid very little for it , but as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growers could not protest . The lack of land , money and goods , the boil of people , produced an atmosphere of scheming and connivance , of sleight of hand , of oaths of collusion , of brute force . What other way through life ? Besides the vineyard the accordion maker and his wife rented five old olive trees and a fig espaliered against the wall , and their lives were concerned with children , goats , hoeing and pruning , lugging panniers of grapes . At night the poverty of the place sounded in the whistle of wind through the dry grapestalks and the rub of moaning branches . Their hold on the plot of land weakened as the landlord , who lived in Palermo in a house with a copper roof , increased the rent one year and again the next . The accordion maker 's shop was at the end of the garden  --  a hut that once housed sick goats with a floor space no larger than a double bed . On a shelf he had pots of lacquer , a box of flake shellac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two corked vials the size of a little finger containing bronze paint . Here were files , scrapers , his chisels  --  one a flake of chert he had unearthed from the soil  --  and gouges , taps , dies , metal tongues and hooks , tweezers and lengths of spring-steel wire , calipers and rules , nippers , punches and clamps , many of these tools stolen from the factory in Castelfidardo  --  how else to gain possession of these necessary things ? With a rigger 's brush of a few sable hairs he painted scrolls and keys , flourishing triple borders bristling with bronze thorns . He sold the instruments to a dealer in the market town who , like the wine merchants , paid him almost nothing , enough to feed magpies , perhaps . As the accordion maker gained mastery over his craft he began to imagine a life not possible in the malicious village , but likely enough in the distant place that rose and set in his thoughts : La Merica . He thought of a new life , fresh and unused , of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He whispered and murmured at night to his wife . She answered , " never . " " Listen , " he said aloud furiously , waking the baby , " you know what your brother wrote . " That bracket-faced fool Alessandro had sent a letter , spotted with red sauce and grimy fingerprints , that said come , come and change your destiny , turn suffering into silver and joy . " The world is a staircase , " hissed the accordion maker in the darkness . " Some go up and some come down . We must ascend . " She refused to agree , put her hands over her ears and moaned when he announced a departure date , later pointed up her chin and rolled her eyes like a poisoned horse when he brought home the trunk with metal corners . The General 's paralysis The accordion maker 's posture , suggestive of hidden violence and challenge , caught the eye of other men . He stood with the left foot planted , the right cocked suggestively , his shoes black broken things . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but was not . He disliked grappling with problems . He depended on his wife to comb through difficulties . He produced the vaulting idea , the optimistic hope , she ordered the way in everything  --  until now . How many wake in the night , stretch out a hand to the sleeping mate and encounter a corpse ? In the evening the accordion maker 's wife had wept a little , lamented the looming journey , but there was nothing , nothing that gave a sign paralysis would come in a few hours to crouch above her ribs and thrust shims into her joints , stiffen her tongue , freeze her brain and fix her eyes . The accordion maker 's fingers trembled up the rigid torso , the stone arm , the hard neck . He believed she was a dead woman . He lit the lamp , cried her name , slapped her marble shoulders . Yet her heart beat , sending the blood pounding through the pipes of veins until her rib-harp vibrated and this encouraged him to believe the afflict     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
