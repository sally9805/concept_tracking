<p> For those of you who still have n't gotten your act together for the Big Feast , here 's a repeat of the basics , with a few other quick hints for success. ; Buying the turkey <p> Figure three-quarters of a pound per serving if the turkey is more than 12 pounds , 1 pound per serving if the bird weighs 12 pounds or less . <p> Buy fresh turkey one or two days before you plan to cook it . Check the " sell by " date on the label ; this is the last day the turkey should be sold. ; Thawing <p> If you buy a frozen bird , allow time to thaw it . Defrost the wrapped turkey on a tray or platter in the refrigerator . Allow about five hours per pound - three to four days for a 16-pound turkey . Never let poultry thaw at room temperature ; bacteria that cause food poisoning grow at this temperature . <p> If you need to defrost the turkey a little faster , place the wrapped bird in a sink and cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 30 minutes per pound. ; Handling <p> After handling raw poultry , always wash hands , utensils and work surfaces with hot soapy water to prevent spreading bacteria to other foods . <p> Use acrylic cutting boards instead of wooden cutting boards ; wooden boards are difficult to wash thoroughly . <p> Remove the neck from the body cavity and giblets from the neck cavity . Rinse the turkey inside and out under cold running water ; pat dry . Twist wing tips under back ; tie legs and tail together securely , or tuck legs under band of skin . Brush with cooking oil and lightly season inside and out with salt and pepper. ; The stuffing <p> If you choose to stuff a turkey , do so just before roasting . <p> Stuff neck and body cavities loosely with stuffing mixture . <p> Most any bread can be used in dressing or stuffing . French bread , braided egg bread , corn bread , biscuits , even sliced wheat bread . Break into 1/2-inch pieces before combining with other ingredients . <p> Cook loosely packed dressing in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bake as long as the turkey . About an hour in a 325-degree oven should heat it through ( to 165 degrees ) . To keep stuffing moist , baste it occasionally and cover it with aluminum foil . If you 're basting with drippings from the roasting pan , they should be at least 165 degrees . <p> Mix dry dressing ingredients with perishables just before cooking . If you cook dressing a day ahead , refrigerate it and reheat to 165 degrees within 45 minutes of serving. ; Roasting <p> For best results , insert an ovenproof meat thermometer in the center of the thickest part of the thigh , not touching the bone . <p> Line roasting pan with foil to make cleanup easier . If your roasting pan has a rack , spray it with a vegetable spray to keep turkey from sticking . <p> To roast the turkey : Preheat oven to 325 degrees . Place the turkey , breast side up , on an adjustable rack in a shallow roasting pan . If you use a roasting thermometer during cooking , insert it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't touch the bone . <p> Brush turkey lightly with vegetable oil or margarine to keep the skin from drying , or rub an herb butter underneath the skin of the turkey breast to keep the white meat from drying out and to impart more flavor . <p> Roast on the center rack . Cooking times are as follows : <p> 9-12 pounds - 3 1/2 to 4 hours stuffed , 3 to 3 1/2 hours unstuffed . <p> 12-16 pounds - 4 to 4 1/2 hours stuffed , 3 1/2 to 4 hours unstuffed . <p> 16-20 pounds - 4 1/2 to 5 hours stuffed , 4 to 4 1/2 hours unstuffed . <p> 20-24 pounds - 5 to 6 hours stuffed , 4 1/2 to 5 hours unstuffed . <p> Remove turkey from oven at least 20 minutes before carving . <p> After the first hour , baste the turkey every 30 minutes or so with pan drippings if desired . Halfway through roasting , turn the pan to ensure even cooking . <p> Cover loosely with a foil tent to prevent overbrowning , if desired . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foil ; this steams instead of roasts it . <p> Check your roasting thermometer , or insert an instant-read thermometer into the thigh to test for doneness . It should register 175 to 180 degrees , and the drumstick should be soft and move easily at the joint. ; Stock and gravy <p> Prepare turkey stock the day before Thanksgiving and refrigerate . That way , once the bird is in the oven you do n't have to wait for the stock to cook before you can begin preparing the dressing . Buy a package of turkey wings or legs when you buy the bird . Boil them with water to cover , a chopped onion , rib of celery and carrot . <p> Do n't place the turkey liver in stock . It makes it cloudy and bitter . <p> Chill pan juices from cooking turkey an hour before making gravy . Fat will rise to the surface . Measure off 3 tablespoons , melt in saucepan and whisk in 3 tablespoons flour . Add 2 cups stock and salt and pepper to taste and stir until thickened. ; Storing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hours after it 's cooked . <p> Remove turkey from the bone and divide it into small portions that will cool faster . Turkey can be safely stored in the refrigerator for 4 days . Stuffing and gravy should be used within 2 days . Bring leftover gravy to a boil before serving. ; Thanksgiving for two <p> Instead of investing in an enormous turkey , buy a capon or a large roasting chicken . You will have fewer leftovers , and to many , chicken is more succulent and flavorful . <p> Make two individual sweet potato casseroles instead of one large casserole . Use one potato per person . Once baked and tender , remove the skin and mash with butter , maple syrup and spices . Spoon into individual 1-cup souffle dishes and bake until hot . Top each casserole with some miniature marshmallows and bake until golden . <p> Forget the large gelatin mold salad . Combine one can of whole cranberry sauce with one can of drained mandarin oranges , drained pineapple chunks , or cut-up cling peaches . Place in a serving bowl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two-way stuffing <p> Prepare your stuffing with sauteed vegetables , rich , well-seasoned chicken stock and butter . At this point , divide the mixture into two buttered casserole dishes . Into one dish , stir in some freshly toasted chestnuts that have been sauteed in a little margarine or butter and some crumbled and fried sweet Italian sausage . Crumble in some dried sage and thyme . Add salt to taste with lots of freshly ground black pepper . <p> Into the other dish ( this one is for the kids ) , add some sauteed apples and raisins , mashed with some apple cider . Bake both casseroles simultaneously until piping hot and crusty on top. ; A lighter gravy <p> Instead of a flour-based giblet gravy , take advantage of the season 's harvest with a blend of vegetables and low-fat broth . The vegetables roast alongside the turkey . They are then pureed to create a golden sauce with rich , robust flavor. ; Country Harvest Gravy <p> Makes 4 1/2 cups <p> 5 cups chicken broth <p> 2 celery stalks , thinly sliced <p> 2 carrots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onion , thinly sliced <p> 1 bay leaf <p> Place chicken broth , celery , carrots , garlic , onion and bay leaf into roasting pan with turkey . Roast turkey on a rack in the roasting pan according to your recipe . When turkey is finished roasting , remove turkey to large platter and keep warm . Remove rack from roasting pan . Discard bay leaf . Puree broth and vegetables in batches in a food processor until smooth . Reheat sauce before serving . <p> - Compiled by our staff and news services
