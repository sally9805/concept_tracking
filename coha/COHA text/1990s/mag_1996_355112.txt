What you see in Bob Dole 's campaign is not what you get . Well ... not always . Or not much longer . <P> So far , it is true , the campaign has often been as listless and unfocused as it has looked . Last week , for example , Dole spent his waning days as Senate majority leader  --  he leaves this Tuesday  --  pushing to a vote two doomed causes : the balanced-budget amendment and a land-based antimissile system . Both lost , not only on the floor , as Dole knew they would , but in public attention . That was captured by two of Bill Clinton 's ideas : a new tax credit for college students and their parents , and a $200 reduction in closing costs on house purchases financed by FHA mortgages . Both proposals are open to criticism : the closing-cost move , for one , will benefit less than 10% of all new-home buyers . Never mind : the plans address two huge concerns of millions of families  --  the costs of college education and of housing  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hyperbolically " American Dream week . " <P> Some of what has been emanating from the Dole camp lately , however , appears to be a sort of smoke screen . Campaign aides have let word get around that the candidate 's forthcoming economic program will feature sweeping tax cuts . That has kept Republican supply-siders quiet but exposed the candidate to some heavy hits for supposedly abandoning his 35-year devotion to budget balancing . Democratic Senator James Exon of Nebraska , for example , jeers that Dole is becoming a " tax-cut candy man . " Such sneering is at best premature . Much of it has been based on a 14-page memo from economists advising the campaign that has been widely leaked but was only a preliminary version of what wound up in Dole 's hands . <P> In fact , say campaign insiders , Dole 's program , though it will include tax cuts , will go far beyond them . If some top aides get their way , it will focus heavily on the pervasive insecurity many families feel despite economic growth and rising employment . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of such arrangements as flextime ( greater freedom for workers to arrange different schedules day to day ) , to give workers more compensatory time for long hours and to provide more part-time work . All are spread-the-work schemes that might offer alternatives to the frequent pattern of heavy layoffs , exhausting overtime for the workers still on the job and an increasing reliance on temporary workers . <P> Details so far are fuzzy to nonexistent . Working them out will be one of the jobs of Donald Rumsfeld and Vin Weber , who last week were named co-directors of policy planning . Previously , what policy planning there had been was run out of Dole 's back pocket , and that was plainly not working . Rumsfeld , a former White House chief of staff and Secretary of Defense , is regarded as a tough and smart operator , but some party veterans consider him to lack a sure instinct for what will win votes . They hope that deficiency will be compensated for by the appointment of Weber , a former six-term Congressman from Minnesota who is considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
