After Shiloh come to live with us , two things happened . One started out bad and ended good . The other started out good and ... Well , let me tell it the way it was . Most everybody near Friendly , West Virginia , knows how Judd Travers treats his dogs , and how he bought this new little beagle to help him hunt , and how the beagle kept running away from Judd 's kicks and curses . Ran to me . They know the story of how I hid the dog in a pen I made for him up in our woods and named him Shiloh . Judd just calls his dogs cuss words . And everybody in Tyler County , almost , heard how a German shepherd jumped into that pen and tore up Shiloh something awful , and then the secret was out . My dad drove Shiloh over to Doc Murphy , who sewed him up and helped him live . And then , because my friend David Howard has the biggest mouth from here to Sistersville , most everybody knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dog . So now he 's mine . Mine and Ma 's and Dad 's and Dara Lynn 's and Becky 's . We all just love him so 's he can hardly stand it sometimes ; tail wags so hard you figure it 's about to fly off . Anyway , the thing that started out bad and ended good was that I promised Doc Murphy I 'd pay him every cent we owed him for fixing up Shiloh . I looked for bottles and aluminum cans the whole test of the summer , but only earned two dollars and seventy cents . When I took it to Doc Murphy , though , so he could subtract it from our bill , he says I can work off the rest , same as I worked for Judd . Next to Judd telling me I can have Shiloh for my own , that was the best news I 'd heard in a long time . And now for the good part that turned bad and then worse : afterf&gt; " He do it on purpose ? " asks Dara Lynn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with little chunks of red ham in the beans , and Dara Lynn 's counting out the pieces of ham on her plate . Wants to be sure she got as many as Ma gave me . " I do n't know , " I tell her . Ma looks at Dad . " This is serious , Ray . " Dad nods . " I guess I 've been hearing right , then . They say Judd 's been stopping off at a bar down near Bens Run . Does his drinking nights and weekends . " Ma 's anxious . " You 'd best keep off the road , Marty , " she says . " You , too , Dara Lynn . You hear his truck coming , give him plenty of room . " " All he 's going to do is get himself arrested , " I say . " Why 's he start drinking so hard all of a sudden ? " Even I know that when a person does that it means he 's bothered . " Maybe he 's thirsty ! " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dara Lynn laughs , too , even though it 's something she might have said . Dara Lynn 's seven . I 'm four years older than that , and supposed to set an example for my sisters , says Ma , which is why it was so hard on my folks when they found out I 'd been hiding Judd 's dog up in our woods . " I think Judd drinks because he 's unhappy , " says Ma . She smooths out the margarine on her piece of corn bread , then takes a real slow bite . " Maybe he misses Shiloh , " says Becky , trying again . I wish she had n't said that . " Why ? " asks Dara Lynn . " He 's got all those other dogs to keep him company . " Ma chews real thoughtful . " I think he looks in the mirror and do n't like what he sees , " she says . " The fact that his dog kept running away and coming to you , Marty , and the way you kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool  --  I think that made him take a good hard look at himself , and it was n't pretty . " Becky nods her head up and down . " Judd 's not pretty , " she says , real serious , and we laugh again . All this time , my dad is breaking up his corn bread over his pile of beans , and then he eats it mixed together , and I notice he 's the one not laughing . " What 's worrying me is that Judd 's been hunting up in our woods , I think . Rabbits , I expect . I found a beer can up there , the brand Judd drinks , and heard a couple shots yesterday , same as last weekend . " " We 've got those woods posted ! " Ma says , meaning we got signs up around the property saying we do n't allow any hunting . But poachers sneak in there sometimes anyway . Up in our woods , and even in our meadow on the far side of the hill . Her gray eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to tell him ! I do n't want him up there drunk , firing his gun off every which way . One of those bullets could end up down here . " " I 'll talk to him , " Dad says . I 'm real quiet then . In fact , I 'm through with the beans on my plate . Been thinking about taking a second helping , but suddenly I 'm not hungry anymore , so I go outside and sit on the steps . It 's been real warm and dry for September , and I like to catch a breeze . Shiloh comes over and lies down beside me , head on my leg . Then he takes this big contented sigh and closes his eyes . What my folks do n't know  --  what nobody knows except me and Judd Travers  --  is how the only way I got Judd to let me keep his dog was that I saw him shoot a deer out of season . A doe it was , too . And when he knew I could report him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he said I could keep Shiloh if I kept my mouth shut about the doe and if I worked for him two solid weeks . I swear Ju dd must have laid awake nights thinking of the hardest , meanest jobs he had for me to do , but I did ' em , every one . So a promise is a promise , even if I should n't have made it in the first place . There was n't any point in telling the secret now anyway . The doe and all traces of the killing were long gone . I lean against the porch post and stroke the top of Shiloh 's head , smooth as corn silk . Here I 'd thought now that Judd and me were almost , but not quite , friends  --  you could n't be real friends with a man like Judd Travers  --  I would n't have to worry anymore . But Ma says drink will make a person do things he never in this world thought he 'd do , and you put drink in Judd Travers , you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not try to run over Shiloh , or shoot him out of spite , but what if he 's up in our woods hunting and Shiloh runs through ? What if Judd shoots at the first thing that moves ? After supper Dad comes out , and he 's carrying this beer can he found in our woods . He puts it on the front seat of the jeep , then climbs in and heads down the driveway . I watch the jeep pause way out by the road , then turn right and go past the mill . It crosses the rusty bridge to the old Shiloh schoolhouse that 's been closed as long as I can remember . After that it 's out of sight and I know that in two or three minutes Dad will pull up outside the trailer where Judd Travers lives . I listen . Yep . About two minutes later , way off in the distance , I hear all Judd 's dogs barking at once , which means they hear the Jeep . All those dogs are mean as nails , ' cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is when he takes ' em hunting . I figure that about this time Judd 's looking out his window , w ondering who 's driving up to see him at seven o'clock on a Sunday night . Then he 'll get up and come to the door in his undershirt . Dad 'll walk up the boards that serve as Judd 's sidewalk , and they 'll stand on Judd 's steps awhile , talking about the kind of weather we 've been having , and are the apples going to be any good this fall , and when is the county going to fix that big pothole just this side of the bridge . And finally , after they say all that , Dad 'll show Judd the beer can and say he 's sure Judd did n't mean to wander off up in our woods when he was hunting , but Dad figures the beer can is his , and he 's been hearing these shots . He surely would appreciate it , he 'll say , if Judd would n't hunt in our woods . He do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's got children , he 's got to look out for them . My mind can think up about a dozen ways Judd could answer back , none of ' em polite , but I do n't let myself dwell on it . I 'm running my hand over Shiloh 's head real slow , and I can tell by his eyes how he likes it . If Shiloh was a cat , he 'd purr . Becky comes out to sit beside me , and pulls her dress way up to let the cool air fan her belly . " Should n't do that way , Becky , " I tell her . You got to start teaching her young or she 'll do like that down in Sistersville sometime , not think twice about it . " Why ? " says Becky , smartlike , and pushes her face right up against mine . " ' Cause it 's not ladylike to show your underpants , is why , " I tell her . I figure that 's how Ma would answer . Dara Lynn 's out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumbs , and she hears what I say to Becky . I can tell by her eyes she 's up to mischief . Wipes her hands on her shorts , then sticks her thumbs dow n inside theelastic and starts snappin ' it hard as she can  --  snap , snap , snap  --  the elastic on her shorts and underpants both , just to rile me . Of course Becky laughs and then she 's doing it , too , both of ' em snapping away at their underpants in a wild fit of the giggles . Girl children , are the strangest people in the world sometimes . But then I hear the Jeep coming back . Dara Lynn hears it , too , and stops bein ' crazy . Finally Becky gives up and we all watch Dad 's jeep  --  the one he delivers his mail income across the old rusty bridge again , on up the road , then turn in at our driveway . Ma comes out on the porch , hands resting on her hips . " Well ? " she says , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dad do n't answer for a moment . Just walks over to the house and throws the beer can in our trash barrel . " Might be a good idea if the kids did n't play up in the woods for a while , " he says . Ma stares after him as he goes inside .
