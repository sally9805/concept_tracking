Writers do n't work very hard . It 's a lot of chatting and eating and television watching and , most of all , talking about writing . On the other hand , corporate lawyers , despite all their negative traits , are pretty efficient . That 's the only plausible explanation for how David Kelley  --  a former lawyer and the creator of Chicago Hope , Ally McBeal , The Practice , this fall 's Snoops , an additional new half-hour version of Ally and two upcoming feature films , Lake Placid and Mystery , Alaska  --  is able to write the great majority of the scripts for his projects . Joyce Carol Oates , I still ca n't figure out . <P> This fall , network television will reflect one man 's vision in a way it has n't since the heyday of CBS founder William Paley . Not only is Kelley taking back the writing duties for the opening episodes of CBS 's faltering Chicago Hope ( the one show he had ceded to a team of writers ) and creating two new shows ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ABC ) , but nearly every network is copying him  --  having just about abandoned the sitcom , they 're trying out his surrealism-specked , hour-long dramedy format . Basically , if you do n't like Kelley , you 'd better buy a good cable package . " It is a little frightening , " says Kelley , 43 , laughing . <P> The scariest part is that Kelley 's efficiency is so quaintly low key . He 's in the office from 9 to 6 ( he 's got to get home to his wife Michelle Pfeiffer and their two kids ) and writes all his scripts with a Paper Mate on a yellow legal pad , usually finishing a first draft in two days . " He trusts himself creatively , " says Steven Bochco , Kelley 's mentor when he worked as a writer for L.A. Law . " He has pure talent , he has craft , and he has clearly found a way to tap into his imagination that does n't take a lot of time . When you add to that a tremendous work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And , like most highly effective people , Kelley does n't watch much TV . <P> The networks do n't seem too worried that their Kelley shows are going to suffer from his increased fecundity . ABC Entertainment president Jamie Tarses , who will be depending on him for Snoops and The Practice , says , " We have David 's guarantee that he 's going to be there creating the footprint for Snoops , getting it to the place where it 's everything that he wants it to be . And frankly that 's enough for us . " CBS 's Leslie Moonves agreed to renew Chicago Hope when Kelley offered to refocus the show , write a few episodes and oversee production . " For me , " says Moonves , " that was good enough assurance . " <P> That 's because network execs know Kelley 's probably going to wind up doing a lot more than he promised . In 1993 , when he was only writing all 23 episodes of his one show , Picket Fences , he told TIME , " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend it for anyone who factors longevity into his lifetime plan . " He probably thought he meant that . But even earlier , as a busy lawyer who had never written before , he used the time while waiting for his court cases to be called to write the 1987 Judd Nelson movie , From the Hip .
