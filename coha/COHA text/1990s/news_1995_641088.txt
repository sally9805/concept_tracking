<p> Columnist vilifies show host she accuses of vilification <p> The extreme political bias of some of The Post 's columnists is most apparent in the Feb. 27 edition , in which Joanne Ostrow has spewed her liberal-biased and hate-filled invective in her TV-Radio column . The column is devoted to her personal attacks on Rush Limbaugh . <p> Ostrow 's right to have political opinions and personal prejudices is undisputed , but the forum of an alleged critical review of a media event is hardly an appropriate medium for her to express them . <p> The use of such pejorative expressions as " mouth off , " " bombast , " " appealing to the baser instincts , " " low-blow cracks " and others demonstrate clearly that Ostrow is hardly engaged in an objective critical review . Ostrow elects to commit the very excesses of which she ( wrongfully ) accuses Limbaugh - statements without basis in fact . <p> For example , I challenge Ostrow to substantiate her statement that " ditto heads see him as the ' avenging angel ' for the moral crusade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Limbaugh for any length of time , she would know that he associates himself with the conservative element , but never as a member of the religious right . " Dismissed by some critics as an entertainer " - what critics ? " Demonizing political opponents " - when and who ? " Repulsive taunts of dying AIDS patients " - what and when ? <p> Ostrow may well " wonder when a left-leaning media star will rise to counter Limbaugh 's punch . " <p> Perhaps only when such left-leaning philosophies achieve some level of universal acceptance and are found to be consistent with the ideals of the majority . <p> JAMES R. HOUSTON <p> Parker <p> In her column about the " Frontline " documentary on Rush Limbaugh , Joanne Ostrow quotes Democratic strategist Paul Begala to describe Limbaugh . According to Begala , " ( Limbaugh ) really does n't want to live in the world of ideas . He wants to turn to personal ridicule and vilification because his goal is not to persuade people - his audience is mostly already decided . He wants instead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Then Ostrow goes on to ridicule and vilify not only Limbaugh but his " followers " as well . She dismisses him because of " his repulsive taunts of dying AIDS patients , " and " his low-blow cracks at even the innocent , like his remarks about Chelsea Clinton 's physical appearance . " <p> I listen to his radio program almost every day , but I have never heard Limbaugh do either of the things Ostrow cites as examples of how he appeals to his " followers " ' baser instincts . <p> If Joanne Ostrow really does want to live in the world of ideas rather than resorting to personal ridicule and vilification , she might begin to experiment with such a noble objective in her column . <p> LINDA GRAVES <p> Lakewood <p> Bias in cultural facilities is disputed <p> On behalf of The Children 's Museum of Denver Inc. , we wish to respond to the Feb. 19 op-ed article , " City 's cultural facilities shut out people of color . " <p> The article questioned the make-up and diversity of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of directors and staffs , and people the organizations serve . <p> Here is our rebuttal to the article : <p> The Children 's Museum of Denver participation includes people who are diverse ethnically , racially , economically and in gender . Diversity is represented in the board of directors , staff and people served by the exhibits , programs , special events and community outreach . African-Americans , Asian-Americans , Caucasians and Hispanics are board members , as are members of the Christian and Jewish faiths . The nine women and 14 men on the board comprise single parents , grandparents , educators , and corporate and community leaders who represent the public , private and nonprofit sectors . <p> The 27 full-time and 13 part-time staffers are as ethnically and culturally diverse as the board of directors . People with handicaps , grandparents , single parents and students round out a cohesive , committed staff . <p> The people served by the museum are diverse economically , physically , culturally and ethnically . Initiatives to reach children , primarily low-income and minorities , have come through collaborative efforts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families . The Regional Transportation District has added the museum to its bus route . <p> During the school year , most visitors participate in school programs offered by our education department . Other users are pre-schoolers accompanied by parents or day- care providers . <p> We are proud to serve the youth and community of Denver and are grateful to the citizens of the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District for their generous support . <p> JAMES V. LEE <p> President , Board of Directors <p> PHYLLIS CHRISMAN <p> Director , Resource Development <p> LAURA CAMPBELL <p> Director , Education <p> The Children 's Museum of Denver Inc . <p> People 's will ignored on pre-parole facility <p> A recent public meeting regarding the volatile issue of a pre-parole facility at Del Camino , just north of Denver on Interstate 25 , was a superb display of democracy in action . About 350 citizens of southwest Weld County - frustrated , irritated and weary of being trampled by their elected officials - gathered to make their stand on pre-parole clear : " We the people do not want a pre-parole facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anywhere else in the state of Colorado . " <p> Representing the voices of these 350 citizens was a panel of six well-spoken opponents of the pre-parole plan , moderated by Wendy Hoffman of the Citizens Action Committee of southwest Weld County . <p> Pre-parole facilities house criminals who are within one to 120 days of their anticipated parole . These inmates have been convicted , served time in other institutions , and are proposed for early release , to make way for new inmates and alleviate overcrowding . <p> Early release does not , however , imply good behavior . Pre-parole facilities , where freedoms are greater and security less stringent than in a full prison , are not for those who have been model prisoners and are close to full rehabilitation . On the contrary , one of the qualifiers for pre-parole is that the inmates were rejected by a community corrections board or program . This means he/she has undergone observation , questioning and evaluation by a screening board and was deemed not yet ready to return to society . <p> This holding tank also snags criminals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have served their time and been released into the community , but failed to abide by the law or the terms of their parole , probation , community corrections program or other community sanctions . <p> These criminals represent rehabilitation gone amok - potential candidates for future crime . Yet despite their behavior , these inmates are not returned to some dungeon of punitive incarceration where armed guards patrol from watch towers . No lethal weapons would be used by patrol personnel at the Del Camino facility . In fact , no lethal weapons would even be stored on the premises . By statutory definition , a pre-parole facility " provides in-residence programs and services to instruct inmates in obtaining and holding regular employment . <p> In an age when crime is rampant , when upstanding citizens everywhere fear for their safety , when only the criminals seem to have rights , early release facilities are not the answer . " Crime will go down if criminals are locked up , " was the message stressed so effectively at the recent public meeting . Citizens are outraged at being held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehabilitate successfully . They want lock-down , tight-security prisons with offenders behind bars and given tough sentences . <p> For 4 1/2 years , public opinion has defeated attempts to introduce pre-parole in Colorado . Yet throughout that time , the Department of Corrections has tried to get a facility on-line with three different construction companies in eight different locations . <p> When are our public servants going to figure out that early release of violent felons is unacceptable to their constituents ? Public opinion stands solidly against a pre-parole center being built at Del Camino or anywhere else in Colorado . <p> If our officials remain unresponsive , they are subverting representative government - a charge levied against at least two Weld County commissioners at the meeting . <p> ELEANOR AYER <p> Frederick <p> Colorado 's water supply is good <p> A recent article stated that in Colorado there are about 50 cases of illness related to drinking contaminated water each year . The Clean Water Action and the Natural Resources Defense Council who reported this give the impression that this is catastrophic , but that is a false impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost totally due to hikers and campers drinking untreated water in the back country . The article focused entirely on the negative aspects of water rather than focusing on the fact that , in general , drinking water in Colorado is of very good quality . Most of the cases reported could be eliminated if people were more careful in their use of untreated water while enjoying the outdoor opportunities available in this state . <p> GEORGE D.
