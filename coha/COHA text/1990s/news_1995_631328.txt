Too many educators today excuse teachers , principals , and school superintendents who fail to substantially raise the performance of low-income minority students by claiming that schools can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear multiple burdens of poverty . The favored solution du jour to minority underachievement is to reduce the handicap of being poor by establishing full-service health clinics at schools , dispensing more housing vouchers , expanding preschool programs , and offering after-school services like mental health counseling for students and parents . America will never fix education until it first fixes poverty -- or so the argument goes . In fact , the skeptics of urban schools have got the diagnosis exactly backward . The truth is that America will never fix poverty until it fixes its urban schools . Antipoverty programs are , of course , an essential part of bolstering our nation 's low-income families . But to argue that these programs are the primary solution for improving student achievement is mistaken . Schools can and do make a critical difference , regardless of a child 's socioeconomic status . Good teachers , effective principals , and great schools have a far greater impact on the achievement gap than any out-of-school antipoverty initiative . Manifest destiny ? Is it still an educational handicap to be raised by a single mom or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows up even before children start kindergarten -- and we should implement effective antipoverty programs to help these families step up the economic ladder . Yet poverty can no longer be the default excuse for giving up on low-income minority students once they start school -- and all the more so now that we have an African-American president who was raised by his single mother and grandparents and whose family was forced to go on food stamps on several occasions . Neither resources nor demography is destiny in the classroom -- and no big-city school district demonstrates those truths more powerfully than the public schools in the nation 's capital . The claim that poverty trumps all in the classroom is belied by the fact that low-income black stu-dents in Washington , D.C. , are academically behindlow-income black students in other cities -- in some cases , years behind . In 2007 , the National Assessment of Educational Progress , known as the nation 's " report card , " did a special assessment in 11 big cities . The NAEP results show that low-income black fourth graders in D.C. score about 20 points lower on the NAEP than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City in both math and reading . To translate that gap into plain English , 10 points on the NAEP scale is roughly equivalent to an extra year of schooling -- which suggests that low-income black students in the District are two years behind their black peers in Charlotte and New York City by the time they reach fourth grade . If the academic achievement of poor black students varies substantially from district to district , the mere fact of being black and poor can not explain why low-income black students in Washington are years behind their peers in some big cities . By contrast , if extra spending and additional resources really were the antidote for the achievement gap , black students in D.C. should handily outstrip most of their urban peers . With the exception of the Boston school district , D.C. spent more per pupil than any other of the largest 100 school districts in the 2004-05 school year , according to a 2008 report from the National Center for Education Statistics . ( Those spending numbers are not adjusted for local differences in the cost of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) It is true that no city has succeeded in eliminating the achievement gap between black and Hispanic students and white students . But a new generation of ambitious charter school networks that includes the KIPP schools , Achievement First , and the Uncommon Schools has succeeded in raising achievement levels among low-income minority students to those of white middle-class students . These new high-performing schools , often called " no-excuses schools , " demonstrate that effective principals and talented teachers can create a school culture of accountability to dramatically boost minority performance . At KIPP D.C. Key Academy , fifth graders in the first class scored at the 21st percentile in reading and the 34th percentile in math on national standardized tests when they arrived . By the time they graduated from middle school in eighth grade , the students were at the 71st percentile in reading and the 92nd percentile in math , outperform-ing the average white student . Three of the four top-performing middle schools for low-income students in Washington on the city 's math achievement test are now KIPP schools . Yet the response to no-excuses schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't really matter . These high-performing schools succeed , skeptics contend , only because the schools " cream " off the best and brightest students or have exceptionally motivated two-parent families that push kids to succeed . The first in-depth examination of these inner-city secondary schools , David Whitman 's recent book , Sweating the Small Stuff , debunks these claims . He finds that students at no-excuses schools are typically one to two grade levels behind when they arrive and that they are not from two-parent superstriver families . Still , in the absence of controlled experiments with random assignment of students , skeptics of high-performing schools could continue to maintain that an unknown demographic x factor explains their success -- until now . A new study by Harvard Prof. Thomas Kane and a team of researchers for the Boston Foundation shows that popular charter schools in Boston do in fact rapidly narrow the achievement gap , even after taking account of the characteristics of the students attending the charters . Charters ' promise . The Boston Foundation study compares the growth in academic achievement of students who won charter school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losers who had to remain in traditional public schools in Boston . The results suggest that the freedom conferred on charters to hire teachers and principals and to shape school culture made a huge difference in subsequent student performance . The students stuck in traditional public schools did only marginally better than their peers , but students enrolled in charter schools saw their achievement shoot up , especially in math . In a single year in a charter middle school , minority students closed half of the black-white achievement gap in math . According to Kane , charter school eighth graders ' math scores were " very close " to the scores of eighth graders in Brookline , a wealthy Boston suburb . While a demanding school culture can powerfully advance minority learning , boosting the number of top-notch teachers in inner-city schools is also critical to closing the achievement gap . As President Obama has stated , " The single most important factor in determining student achievement is not the color of their skin or where they come from . It 's not who their parents are or how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The impact of a bad teacher is hard to overcome by good parenting alone . One study of 9,400 math classrooms in Los Angeles in grades three through five projects that if low-income minority students could be assured of having teachers who fell in the top 25 percent of effective teachers four years in a row ( in lieu of a subpar instructor ) , those students could close the achievement gap altogether . School improvement may not be the only route to narrowing the achievement gap , but it is the royal road to success . Putting more resources into antipoverty initiatives with a demonstrable link to student achievement , like providing after-school tutoring and extended learning time or offering eye exams and free eyeglasses to needy students with vision problems , is a good idea . So , too , is expanding high-quality early childhood education programs , particularly as policymakers identify ways to duplicate the enduring learning gains achieved in a number of model preschool initiatives . Still , once children reach school age , no antipoverty initiative has an impact on the achievement gap that even compares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that programs like housing vouchers or expanding the earned-income tax credit are not important or vital to reducing poverty among needy families . But the evidence shows that it is the good teacher who holds the most promise for significantly reducing the achievement gap . More than a decade ago , education historian Diane Ravitch warned that " we must take care not to build into public policy a sense of resignation that children 's socioeconomic status determines their destiny . Public policy must relentlessly seek to replicate schools that demonstrate the ability to educate children from impoverished backgrounds instead of perpetuating ( and rewarding ) those that use the pupil 's circumstances as a rationale for failure . " Today , it is past time to heed that advice . To close the nation 's insidious achievement gap , we must replace the culture of excuse in our schools with a culture of accountability that works relentlessly to provide high-needs students with effective teachers .
