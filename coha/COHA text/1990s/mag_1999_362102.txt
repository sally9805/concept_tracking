Considering all the pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo that passes for nutritional advice these days , I ca n't help being enthusiastic when a really good guide based on solid research shows up in bookstores . And when the subject of that book is young children 's nutritional needs  --  which are very different from those of adults  --  you can bet I 'm going to recommend it to every parent I know . I 'm talking about Feeding Your Child for Lifelong Health ( Bantam ; $15.95 ) by Susan Roberts , a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Boston , and Dr. Melvin Heyman , a pediatric gastroenterologist at the University of California in San Francisco . Their book , which is available starting this week , should be required reading for anyone with children under age six . <P> Even the most diligent parents are likely to learn something about feeding their kids . Paradoxically , as the authors explain , many families following the latest nutritional guidelines may actually be putting their children 's health at risk . Why ? Because the reduced-fat , high-fiber diets that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vitamins , minerals and other nutrients essential for growing bodies . " With the current emphasis on eating less red meat and fewer eggs , it 's virtually impossible for kids to eat a balanced diet , " Roberts says . The two biggest gaps are iron and zinc . Kids also are n't getting the calcium they need , in part because they 're drinking more soda and juice and less milk than kids did 20 years ago . <P> It 's best to get these and other nutrients from food . But they 're so important for proper development  --  even a short bout of mild anemia , for example , can have permanent effects on young brains  --  that Roberts and Heyman recommend daily supplements ( though not megavitamins ) for kids at least up to age three . And no , they did n't take money from the vitamin companies to make that recommendation . <P> You 're still going to find the emphasis on fruits and vegetables that you 'll get in any good book on nutrition . But there 's plenty of practical advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their peas rather than just shoving them aside . One tip : you may have to serve two-year-olds a new food frequently  --  as often as 15 times over several months . As Roberts and Heyman explain , there 's an evolutionary reason for toddlers to be picky eaters : it cut down a tiny hunter-gatherer 's chances of food poisoning . Most important , do n't trigger their natural rebellious streak by letting on that you think the food is good for them . <P> Feeding Your Child also has the smartest take I 've ever seen on the importance of variety in healthy eating . Government guidelines stress the consumption of many different foods . But they never warn that this can work against you . Studies show that if a plate contains two types of cookies , for instance , you 'll eat more than if only one kind is available . The same is true for vegetables . Roberts and Heyman advise parents that if they must keep cookies in the house , they should stick to one brand and save the variety for healthier foods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes a little planning and a lot of patience to make sure they eat right . But the results are worth it . <P> For more information , visit
