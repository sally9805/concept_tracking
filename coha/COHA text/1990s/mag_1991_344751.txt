No matter what the confusing confrontation between Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill may have obscured , it left one thing clear : the U.S. is still haunted by powerful racial and sexual myths . After Hill 's charges burst into print , Thomas and his supporters equated her claims with the lynchings of thousands of black men . " I will not provide the rope for my own lynching , " Thomas declared at the start of the hearings ; later he added that the broadcast of Hill 's testimony was a " high-tech lynching " of an " uppity " black . <P> That was a curious choice of words from a man who has spent his public life distancing himself from racial stereotypes . But the image of Thomas symbolically dangling from a tree tapped into the pent-up rage all blacks feel at the violence and bigotry they have suffered for centuries : in this case , an appeal to racial resentments was the first resort of a black man accused of sexist crimes . To accept Hill 's story , Thomas implied , was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swayed many males , both black and white . The impact may have been caused in part by the fact that black women 's complaints about sexist behavior are taken even less seriously than white women 's . Held down by racism and the sexism of both black and white males , black females are one of society 's most oppressed groups . Yet their attempts to call attention to their plight routinely provoke storms of angry denial of the legitimacy of their complaints . An example : the denunciations that were heaped on Alice Walker for her novel The Color Purple and the film that was based on it . Some critics falsely charged that Walker was a lesbian who hated black men because she created a heroine who was savagely mistreated by nearly every black male she encountered . <P> The tendency to dismiss black women 's complaints as either exaggerations or outright fantasies has grown stronger since the Tawana Brawley fiasco . In that case , a 15-year-old black girl claimed that she had been abducted and raped by a mysterious gang of white men . It turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feminists believe the doubts about black women 's veracity stirred up by Brawley 's lies may have led to acquittals in several rape cases in which the victim was a black woman . <P> The lowest point on the first day of the hearings came when Pennsylvania Republican Arlen Specter implied that Hill had simply fantasized Thomas ' asking for dates and his lurid remarks about pornography . It is all but inconceivable that a similarly qualified man , black or white , would be accused not merely of lying but of imagining things . On Saturday the campaign to discredit Hill sank to even lower depths when Utah Republican Orrin Hatch suggested that she had fabricated her accusations , in cooperation with liberal interest groups , from such disparate sources as court cases and The Exorcist . <P> Being taken seriously was only one of the obstacles Hill had to confront in making her case against Thomas . She may have found it equally difficult to go against two other strains of racial solidarity . One is the widespread fear among blacks of " washing dirty laundry in public , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the strong possibility that her charges would end up derailing the confirmation of the only black George Bush would appoint to the Supreme Court .
