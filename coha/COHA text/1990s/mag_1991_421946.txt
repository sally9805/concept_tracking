<p> * The AIM family 's success story * Investment trends and top-performing funds TWO WINNERS FROM AIM <p> Only 18 of 150 aggressive-growth funds generated positive total returns over the past year . AIM Weingarten , ranked fourth this month in that category , was one . The fund , co-managed by Harry Hutzler ( since 1969 ) and Jonathan Schoolar ( since 1987 ) , earned its short-term record the hard way , by remaining almost fully invested throughout a rocky year in stocks . The fund 's long-term record is equally impressive , with returns better than Standard &; Poor 's 500-stock index in eight of the past 11 years . <p> GROWTH SAVANTS . Hutzler and Schoolar are investors in blue-chip growth stocks . You could divide their portfolio into core holdings-for example , WalMart Stores , bought ten years ago at a split-adjusted price of 50 cents a share , then again and again on the way up and stocks that surprise Wall Street with higher-than-expected earnings . <p> Core holdings exhibit growth in earnings of at least 16% over the past ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bristol-Myers Squibb and Waste Management . IMCERA Group is a recent addition to the surprise-the Street segment . When IMCERA reported third-quarter profits of 15 cents per share over what had been expected , Weingarten bought at just under $57 . By mid December its price was $73 . <p> AIM Charter , managed by veteran Julian Lerner , ranks sixth this month among growth and income funds on the basis of its one-year return . Lerner , like Hutzler and Schoolar , invests largely on the basis of earnings growth . He concentrates on blue-chips from which he anticipates increasing dividends . The portfolio is weighted toward drug , food , tobacco and soft drink companies . <p> CASH HOARD . Unlike Hutzler and Schoolar , Lerner is not reluctant to build up a cash cushion-about 20% of assets recently . " Charter did well this year because we had the right stocks and managed to stay out of danger , " says Lerner . " Once a stock 's price heads south , I 've got to have a compelling reason to hold it . " As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above average . Major holdings : Philip Morris , Johnson &; Johnson , General Mills , Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer . <p> Can Charter and Weingarten repeat their 1990 performances ? " I think growth will still work in ' 91 , " replies Weingarten 's Schoolar . This fits neatly with his investment strategy , but is the prediction self-serving ? Maybe , yet he and Hutzler have the record to back it up-ninth among aggressive-growth funds over three years , second over five years and fourth over ten years . Both Charter and Weingarten carry a 5.5% sales fee .
