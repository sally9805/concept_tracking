Rebecca Ore 's work has attracted attention since she first appeared on the scene about ten years ago . Her most recent novel , Gaia , made the Locus Recommended Reading List , and her short fiction is always an event . <p> " My Mother , the Alien . and Me " is a different sort of alien story , quieter than most , yet with a power all its own . <p> We found the alien drowning himself in our pond , his face tentacles wrapped around branches of sodden oak . Mother kept talking about some woman who 'd left her husband as she went down to see who the body was . I did n't know if she kept chattering to keep me from seeing the drowned man , repelling me with air turbulence , or if she talked from nervousness . I wondered if Dad had come back to do this . <p> From where I stood , I only saw what looked like a man . Mother said to me , " Well , Lisa , if a man leaves a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wonder how she drove him away , but when a woman does as Sally did , well , people always make her the blackest villain . Maybe I did do something wrong , but Sally is n't the blackest villain . " Her voice changed as the head finally loosened its hold on the logs and rolled over . " I do n't think we did him any favors . " <p> Not Dad . I came down and screamed when I saw the face . Worms seemed to have eaten the face . I could n't imagine tubifex that thick or such leeches in our pond . Whatever was eating his face , some of them bled as red as human blood . <p> Mother put her finger out , felt down one of the worm things and said , " It 's part of his face . " <p> I screamed again when the mouth moved under the tentacles . <p> " Do n't , " Mother said . " Only our thinking makes monsters . But I do n't think we did him any favors . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A woman would have planned better to be rescued or would have drowned herself deeper . " Mother hauled the thing further up on the bank . " We need to get him inside . People around here tend to really polarize issues . " <p> We need to call the cops , the Army , the CIA , I thought , but since Dad left us , I was afraid if I made Mother angry , she 'd leave me , too . But I could n't go near the thing . " I ca n't go near the thing . " <p> " He was trying to kill himself , so I 'd say he 's harmless . Now are you going to help or do you want to go back to the house , do the breakfast dishes , then cook lunch . " <p> " What does it eat ? " I asked , meaning to stall . <p> But Mom knew how I could stall by asking questions . " Quit being such a baby . He 's hurt . " <p> I wondered if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Mother liked to fuss , so I said , " I 'll take his feet , " hoping that those would n't be an even greater horror than the face . <p> Mother said , " Teeth look like he might be a pure carnivore . " <p> Just what we needed , I thought , now that Dad left us . The thing 's skin at the feet was thick and clammy , like a purse some thief had thrown into the pond . " Mom , Dad might not have left you if you were n't such a sucker for males in pain . " <p> " I was n't going to make a career of adultery , " she said . " Your Dad knew I was sorry afterward . " <p> The alien between us said , " Can the universe produce pure evil ? " He spoke perfect English . I nearly dropped his feet . <p> " If you thought you were pure evil and decided to drown yourself , then I guess you 're not pure evil , " Mother said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . " <p> The tentacles circled and then seemed to form two groups pointing back at Morn . " You did n't do me any favors . " <p> " You wanted to upset my child by leaving your dead body in our pond ? " <p> I asked , " What do you eat ? " <p> He said , " I 'll die on you . " <p> " Try me , " Morn said . <p> I realized now that Mom had captured a vulnerable male , she 'd never let him leave . Suicides are always aimed killings , but while this one had n't been aimed at us , Mom was furious with disappearing guys even if they escaped through the grave . Even at eleven I did n't want her to save some monster with tentacles from the top of his head to his mouth and even around that . But what I most feared was that Mom would prefer this sick alien who needed both physical and psychic nursing to me . Maybe if I tried suicide myself , I thought , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . <p> The alien squirmed , but Morn twisted his shoulders and kneed him in the head as though by accident . " If I let you go , you 'd just go back to the pond . " <p> " Your daughter 's seen me , so it would n't be a shock . " <p> " How come you speak English ? " I asked . <p> " He 's an observer , " my mother said . " If he had been going to hurt us , he could have done so before he completely mastered the language . " <p> The alien let his tentacles splay in all directions . I wondered if his eyes were compound like an insect 's or if each tentacle end was a more perfect eye than a squid 's . Squid eyes are even better evolved than mammal eyes . And when his tentacles splayed like that , was he not seeing anything or scanning for movement without fine focusing ? <p> How would I ever understand the planets and space ? If I 'd been good at math , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me before he left . I wondered if he 'd have forgiven Mother if I 'd been a boy math whiz . Cunt that threw a pity fuck at some loser and her daughter who was too stupid for quadratic equations , why should Dad have stayed ? <p> While I thought I knew the theories , half my answers came out wrong because somewhere in my calculations , I 'd reverse figures without noticing . The figures I transposed made the bars of my prison . <p> So Mother and I hauled the alien to the house and put him in the basement on a fold-out bed we kept for when her brother might come to see us . The alien gathered his seeing tentacles , looked around the room , then looked at us . I wondered if we seemed as monstrous to him . <p> He said , " My planet was rotated away from my sun . " <p> Mother stood there , waiting for him to explain why that put him in our pond . I said , " Into another dimension , " numerical ghosts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theories , no for the figuration . Mother looked at me sharply . <p> The alien said , " Yes . " <p> Mother said , " Time-space slippage . " She read the books I bought down at the drugstore even though every time I bought them , the druggist asked if I was buying them for my brother or boy friend . He 'd figured in my head shakes that I was ashamed of my sweetheart . <p> " My species was sentenced to die . " <p> Mother said , " If anyone has the power to rotate a planet away from its sun , they sure as hell had the power not to commit genocide . " <p> The alien said , " With the whole universe against you , deciding you 're the evil one is the most logical course . Otherwise , the universe is insane . " <p> I thought that seemed logical , but Mother said , " Nothing about this universe is altogether that consistent . Now , what do you eat ? " <p> " Live mammals . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get you plenty of rabbits , lab rats . Ca n't you do with chickens ? " <p> " I do n't torture my food . I love my food . Chickens lack essential amino acids . " I think he wondered how bright we were after all . " The proteins are n't complete , but they 're an okay supplement . " <p> Mom said , " You better not love either of us that way or we 'll pull out your tentacles . Bet we can come up with some synthetics suit you just fine , or the right combination of plant proteins . " <p> " Wrong proteins break me out in welts , " he said . <p> " Hives , " Mother said . " I get them when I eat strawberries . Well , how would a rabbit suit you ? I know a man who 's got eating rabbits for sale . And I could get lab stuff from the college . " <p> " You 're not a professor ? " <p> " No . Lab tech . But I understand about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why are you saving me ? I would have rotted into nothing in the pond . " <p> Mother stopped tucking blankets around him and said , " Nobody has the right to be in that much despair . " <p> " I 'm not human . " <p> " Are you trying to tell me that you were killing yourself for some alien reason that does n't have anything to do with anger , despair or guilt ? You were n't trying to use your death to obliterate a universe that wanted to obliterate you ? <p> " All of those reasons , yes . And alien ones you 'd never understand . " <p> " You sound like a damned self-centered man to me . " <p> " I 'm not human . Your values do n't apply to me . " <p> " You 'll be glad we saved you later . I ca n't believe anyone tried to wipe out your whole species and killed every other living thing on your planet to do this , wiped out all the evolutionary possibilities . That 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this planet , I sure would n't trust them . " <p> The alien collapsed his tentacles again into flesh spagetti . " I 'm going to go crazy . " <p> " Humans do n't let crazy people kill themselves , either , " my mother said . " And you 're making too much sense to be insane . " <p> The tentacles knotted themselves , pulled the knots through , over and over . I wondered if that 's what alien crazy looked like . Then the alien laughed , sharp teeth and all . " Oh , that hurt . " <p> " I had to break some of them to get you loose , " More said . " Do you want to wash them out and put anything on them or would you just try to drown yourself in the bathroom sink ? " <p> " I 'd like about five pounds of rabbit . " He began pulling his tentacles through his fingers , the other tentacles wincing when he touched the injured ones . " I 'm an interstellar fugitive . Turn me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wondered if we were going to keep him forever in our basement . Mom said , " You must have a way of communicating with your people . " <p> " My home planer 's gone . The people who did that will trace any signals to survivors off planet . " <p> I asked , " Do n't you have other people here with you ? " <p> He shook his head , though perhaps he was lying . <p> " Then , there you have it , " Mother said . " You 've been alone for a while . If being alone would have driven you insane , you 'd have gone mad long before you spoke such perfect English . " <p> I thought , but at least he could talk to his people . Then I wondered if he was only dangerous in groups . Some fish are like that . You could carefully train five of them from fryhood to only eat gold fish and then you could keep them with other fish that were n't gold colored . But if you had seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be much more dangerous . <p> Whatever , Mother sure had n't been babbling about people I hardly knew and never cared about since we dragged him out of the pond . She said , " Lisa , why do n't you go over to Mr. Jackson 's and buy us a suckling pig . I think our friend here might need some fat calories , too . That is , if you 're not allergic to pig ? " <p> The alien said , " You prefer I take the head in one bite ? " <p> Mother nodded . We 'd feel better if his food did n't suffer . " So , you could eat freshly killed meat ? " <p> " Only if very fresh , " the alien said . " That 's what made us seem like monsters , I 'm afraid . " <p> Mother said , " Crueler to hang some dumb bird by the feet and swing it around on a slaughter line than to bite its head off . " <p> " Mother , he ca n't live off chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " We can set some live traps for rats , " Mother said . <p> " Rats go for the tentacles , " the alien said . " You plan to save me , you need to get me food now . " <p> I took twenty dollars to Mr. Jackson 's and bought two suckling pigs and carried them home squealing in a burlap bag . He seemed pretty surprised that we wanted to raise hogs , but , along with the pond , we did have an old hog lot that came with the property . But I figured that we 'd have to vary the alien 's diet or someone would wonder what were we doing with all sorts of suckling pigs and rabbits . <p> That night , I had a nightmare with the alien sometimes being the horror figure , sometimes being Mom 's friend and so the good guy . I woke up paralyzed with nightmare juice , then got my body back . He had to have been a spy , but since we were neither dead nor under alien domination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mother began talking about all sorts of people we used to know when we lived in town with Dad , not here in an old farmhouse with an alien in the basement . Only now I had the alien to trade wry glances with , his tentacles rocking back and forth , me raising my eyebrows . My mother , the adulteress on the edge of town , turned so harshly moral now no one even bothered to see if she could be had . <p> I went to school and read as much science as did n't come twisted in math . A boy took interest in me . He was good in math and had shortwave radios , and wire recorders from the Second World War . He taught me how to make gunpowder from sulfur , saltpeter , and barbecue charcoal ground up into powder between two bricks . <p> If I took my clothes off , I could join the boys ' short-wave radio club . Down in the woods , I took my clothes off . Still naively clothed since he himself was only thirteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other boys hidden in the woods around the brush hut giggled . <p> Mother got my secret out of me and questioned me away from the alien for hours . Had he penetrated ? With what , I wanted to know . With his dick , no , but I prayed for my period to make sure I had n't forgotten anything , to make sure I was n't pregnant . <p> A year and a half later , I got my first period and it reminded me again that I was n't supposed to be good at science , not even interested in it . Girls who were curious got molested . <p> The alien turned into the ordinary creature in the basement until I discovered Kafka when I was fifteen . " Metamorphosis " turned me inside out and over . I knew for the first time what it might mean to live in a world that would prefer one to be dead . Without completely thinking out the consequences , I took the book home to the alien . We sat weeping and wringing tentacles together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper pulp with huge carnivorous teeth , spitting them out . <p> The alien said , " Now you understand . " <p> I said , " But Gregory Samsa did n't want to die , even if he 'd become a large bug . " I felt as though the boy from my last innocent years lay down on me again , cloth against skin , surrounded by snickering boys . " What can we do ? " <p> The alien said , " You can mature . " <p> " To be like my mother ? " <p> " To listen to your mother all day long . " <p> " She wants me to read romance novels to prepare me for life . Do you really want to be dead ? " <p> " Not badly enough to fight your mother , " the alien said . <p> I paid the fine to the library for eating " Metamorphosis " out of the Kafka collection , and continued in high school , mocked in the halls by girls who 'd never been so foolish as to get naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have all moved away , my mother , the alien , and me , to somewhere kind . <p> " What you want is a land that has never existed , " the alien said . " Certainly not any planet I 've ever heard about . " <p> I was stupid . Because I 'd taken my clothes off years earlier , I failed Algebra II . Then , at eighteen , my freshman year in college , I caught my teeth before they met through the cockskin of my first naked man . <p> " Be careful , " he said , not knowing how I craved to bite and bite . <p> I pulled back and said , " We should n't be doing this , " and dressed and left him . The world had men in it who wanted their cockskin bitten and my teeth ached . But the ones who wanted it were never grown science boys who 'd gotten some stupid girl naked to initiate her into the reality that girls are truly too stupid for short-wave radios . The guys who wanted my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks , attacks that would make me feel vile and would make me hurt them all the more . <p> The alien knew something more wrong had happened . I saw his tentacles squirming and wanted to bite them , wanted to bite my own nipples . I said , " I nearly did a man serious damage . " <p> The alien said , " With what ? " <p> " With my teeth , " I said . <p> He squirmed his tentacles in what I knew was a smile . He said , " Let me see your teeth . " <p> I bared my teeth at him , feeling both rage and futility . He ran a thick-skinned finger around my mouth and said , " Your teeth are so ambiguous . Do you want to bite me ? " <p> " No . " <p> He said , " I would like you to bite me . On the shoulder . On the breast . I 'll keep you away from my tentacles . " <p> He took my head in his hands and guided me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin , the teeth running wild , me crying . Then exhausted , I leaned against him and he stroked my hair as though that were something Mother taught him . <p> " In a few days , I 'll have skin food , " he said . " I hope you are n't allergic to it . " <p> " You 're going to feed me ? " <p> " Our young have blunt teeth . This would make me happy . " " How hard do I have to bite ? " I asked , my teeth satiated for now . <p> " Until you learn that not everything male tries to shame you , " the alien said . <p> So I bit little roast beef sections of skin away , weeping for all the math that turned his world away from his sun and kept me from understanding how my universe operates . Eventually , I forgave my twelve-year-old self for being so naive and my mother for not better preparing me and the alien for being male with tentacles . <p> Some years later , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pond . Mother gave him a dose of poison in a little white paper lab cup , but he held it for a while in his swollen hands , arranged his tentacles to see us as well as he could , and said , " Well , now , this is a happy ending for someone . " <p> " Not for me , " I said . " But was our saving you worth it fifteen years ago ? " <p> " Worth it for you , I think , " the alien said . He took the poison and swam out into the pond since the oak had rotten away . <p> Mother said , " I 've thought about applying for the reward .
