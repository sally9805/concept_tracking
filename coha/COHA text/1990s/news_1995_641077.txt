<p> THE mission was simple . <p> Find out what Denver still needs . The still is a reference to the city 's three massive new public facilities scheduled to open soon : Denver International Airport , Denver Central Library and Coors Field . And a new downtown amusement park is n't far behind . <p> But nothing is as simple as it seems . During this admittedly unscientific survey , there emerged a subtext - things Denver has but does n't need , such as DIA . " Now we need a close-in airport , " said Louis Johnson , a local comedian . <p> Angst , too , emerged concerning Coors Field . Not that anyone wished it was n't there . But people did mention that Denver needs a major-league baseball team willing to play there , still doubtful as the baseball strike drags on . <p> Since this is a subjective - although , we hope , nonetheless fascinating - exercise , it 's useful to start with a dose of objectivity . That was provided by Kim Long , the trend-watching demographics observer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible that major cities could have and found Denver in good shape and constantly improving . <p> " We do n't have jai alai , but who does ? " Long said . " We even have polo . And we do n't have a lakefront . But we have a dead sea - the whole Plains . " <p> We also have close proximity to legalized gambling , numerous reservoirs that provide for surface-water recreation and a river , even if few would confuse the South Platte with the Mississippi . <p> " Up until recently , we did n't have a toll road , " he said . " And now we have light rail , though we do n't yet have a subway . " The new Speer Boulevard Tunnel , too , is a sign of Denver 's status . " An indication of a big city is that it has to put transportation underground because there 's nowhere else to put it , " Long said . <p> With prolonged deliberation , he did find several big-city things that Denver still lacks : a demolition-derby track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from here , an on-line major newspaper , and its own area code - although that changes in April . <p> So with those observations forming the frame , what did the survey respondents wish Denver had ? Those queried were invited to be as silly or as serious as they wished . And they were . <p> Sometimes , the silly replies were revealing . Not everyone likes the city 's dry climate and flat-as-a-pancake topography , even if it is close to the some of the world 's most dramatic mountains . If only we had an ocean or big lake with beaches , several said . Dave Weber , habitat biologist for the Colorado Division of Wildlife , would like more fish . And Al Kraizer , director of the Cellular One LoDo Music Festival , would like to be able to catch them at an all-night fishing pier on the South Platte River near downtown . <p> Some of the silly answers showed how the love of professional sports has no limits . Chuck Morris , whose firm manages musicians , wants a shrine to Doug Moe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a saint - I love Doug Moe . " <p> And while several mentioned the need for an NHL hockey team , rock-concert promoter Doug Kauffman would go even further . He wants a professional roller-derby team . <p> But of the more serious replies , two trends emerged . First , the impact of growth is frightening , and the lingering brown cloud is scaring the heck out of folks . " What Denver needs is clean , lovely air , " said Marilyn Megenity , Mercury Cafe 's owner . She believes greater reliance on bicycles is needed as an alternative . <p> But others feel an expanded , automated rapid-transit system is absolutely crucial . " Buses do n't work - sitting in a bus in traffic is n't much better than sitting in a car in traffic , " said concert promoter Barry Fey . <p> Respondents suggested such a transit system needs to connect the suburbs to each other and downtown with Cherry Creek , DIA and Boulder . And light rail is n't necessarily the best way to do it . <p> " Light rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency , " said Ricardo LaFore , a community activist who is a staff aide to U.S. Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell . " Until we have that , we ca n't be in the same league as Boston or San Francisco . " <p> And there also is concern about who is sharing in the benefits of growth , said Chet Whye Jr. , Colorado executive director of the National Rainbow Coalition . " We 're developing rapidly , but not everybody is sharing equally , " Whye said . " We could wind up developing as two cities - a downtown showcase and a periphery that 's a wasteland . " <p> A second concern , and this also was mentioned repeatedly , was that the city of Denver lacks a " happening area " at night . Duane Davis , co-owner of Capitol Hill 's Wax Trax record store , said Denver needs " outward manifestations of spirit and vitality ; several blocks of places to go so it encourages pedestrian traffic . " <p> He means the kind of area where interesting , small shops and bar/restaurants intermingle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music clubs . Such places are urban districts lively in the day that keep going - like strong batteries - once it turns dark . <p> The quest for such a " happening area " came up several times , although definitions of it varied . Some thought lower downtown might be evolving into that area , but others fretted that its emerging profile of baseball , brewpubs , steakhouses and sports bars does n't exactly sing out " culture . " Others said the West Highland neighborhood around West 32nd Avenue and Lowell Boulevard might fill the bill . <p> Similarly , people want a downtown revival , especially along the upper 16th Street Mall . " New downtown retail - ideally it would include great department stores , " said Eileen Byrne , a retail analyst . " We need more than impulse retail downtown ; we need destination retail . " <p> Dianne Vanderlip , Denver Art Museum 's curator of modern and contemporary art , was even more specific - downtown needs Nordstrom . <p> You could certainly create a " happening area " out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respondents . Especially if there were more good restaurants that served dinner past 10 p.m. , a big concern for Denver Nuggets center Dikembe Mutombo . <p> But also mentioned were more " great " seafood restaurants , a straight-ahead vegetarian restaurant " like Greens in San Francisco or Cafe Florence in Seattle , " an oyster house , an old-fashioned New York-style Italian restaurant , a downtown grocery and large farmers ' market , and a sky-view restaurant atop an office tower . <p> So what else does Denver need ? Here are some of the other replies , with explanations whenever warranted : <p> Better radio stations : Harry Tufts , owner of Denver Folklore Center , finds Denver 's two public radio stations - KCFR-FM and KUVO-FM - poorly serve those interested in acoustic-oriented music - American folk and bluegrass , international folk and traditional blues . He wishes there would be a third one . " There are lots of acoustic-oriented kinds of music - even some on the contemporary side of pop music - not explored by commercial stations , " he said . <p> Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free-form in style and aggressive about playing adventurous rock by musicians on small , independent record labels ; an " alternative country " station ; and a black-oriented radio station with strong reception . <p> Denver jazz orchestra : " I really like the idea of Jazz at Lincoln Center at New York - the idea of having a jazz orchestra funded and presented in the manner as a symphony orchestra , " said Ron Miles , local jazz musician and educator . " It honors people like Duke Ellington in the same way we honor Beethoven or Bach . " <p> But rather than expanding the definition of a Denver symphony orchestra , the city might have greater need to show support for its existing symphony . " I wish there was more acceptance so we did n't have to fight all along the way , " said Blair Chotzinoff , critic for classical-music station KVOD-FM . <p> Trains : New Amtrak service to Kansas City and along the Front Range . <p> Aquarium : There already is a group trying to bring one , Ocean 's Journey , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be just a gateway to the mountains , we need that , " said Bill Mosher , president of Downtown Denver Partnership . <p> Mining museum : <p> " Miners always are wanting to start a museum because they have the equipment to do it , " said John Welles , retired <p> executive director of the Denver Museum of Natural History . <p> Shelters : People called for more shelters for the homeless and domestic-abuse victims . <p> More help for youths : This could take the form of better-structured programs at recreation and community centers , as proposed by Big Eddie 's Bar-B-Que owner " Big Eddie " Hollins , or " more planning among the schools , the mayor 's office and housing " to help children , as suggested by Ken Seeley of the Colorado <p> Foundation for Families <p> and Children . <p> Newspapers with fewer sportswriters and more book reviewers . <p> A downtown ski slope . <p> Children 's movie theater . <p> City-sponsored development of the local music scene : Mike Drumm , the music-video producer who suggested this , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a music-development office and cable channel . <p> In a similar vein , art dealer Joshua Hassel suggests Denver create an arts enterprise zone - one that subsidizes artist residences and studios in a particular area - similar to a Miami Beach program . <p> Downtown bowling lanes . <p> Live-performance theater with 4,000-5,000 seats : " What Buell should have been , " Barry Fey said . <p> Denver film institute : This would include screens for festivals and retrospectives , a library , and classrooms . <p> Jazz club in Five Points . <p> Downtown playground . <p> Criminal justice center at closed Stapleton Airport : Sam Arnold , owner of The Fort restaurant , envisions Stapleton 's existing buildings and open space serving as courtrooms , juvenile-detention center , medium-security prison and training facilities for state and local police agencies . <p> But not so fast ! Mohamad Jodeh , owner of the Oasis restaurant , thinks Stapleton would better work as a major tourist attraction . " If the Smithsonian made the Air &; Space Museum at the old airport , or if there was a mini-Las @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Then again , Stapleton might make a good spot for cowboy poet Baxter Black 's idea : " A refugee camp for prairie dogs dislocated by suburban sprawl . " <p> Steven Rosen is a Denver Post staff writer . <p> Broadway ripe for arts district <p> DENVER really does need a " happening area " with a cultural focus . All vital big cities have them . But where ? <p> Lower downtown may be evolving into the best place in the world to watch a major-league baseball game and then talk about it over beer and beef amid rehabbed old buildings . <p> But that is n't culture . And I 'm not sure if LoDo can develop simultaneously as both an arts district and a sports district . It 's conceivable - especially in the area below Larimer Square where there already is a Tattered Cover Book Store and a classically Bohemian coffeehouse , St. Mark 's . But arts and sports just do n't mix well . <p> West Highland holds promise , as does Cherry Creek North . But it strikes me that a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly from First Avenue ( the Mayan Theatre ) all the way down to Alameda Avenue . This area already is quietly , organically struggling to become just such a place and is not yet denuded by parking lots . <p> It has n't yet hit critical mass , especially as a strolling neighborhood , and may never do so as along as one-way Broadway essentially serves as a multilane expressway extension between downtown and southbound Interstate 25 . <p> So if I could wish any one thing for Denver , it would be to return Broadway to a normal two-way urban street through this area . It could transform a struggling yet promising part of the city into that elusive happening area . <p> And while we 're at it - how about a sweet-soul oldies radio station and a 3-D Imax movie theater ? And come to think of it , an ocean would n't be bad . <p> - Steven Rosen <p> What do you think Denver still needs ?
