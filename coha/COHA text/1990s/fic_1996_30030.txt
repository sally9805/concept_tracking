You 're good , Corran , but you 're no Luke Skywalker . Corran Horn 's cheek still burned at the memory of Commander Antilles 's evaluation of his last simulator exercise . The line had been a simple comment , not meant to be cruel nor delivered that way , but it cut deep into Corran . I 've never tried to suggest I 'm that good of a pilot . He shook his head . No , you just wanted it to be self-evident and easily recognized by everyone around you . Reaching out he flicked the starter switches for the X-wing simulator 's engines . " Green One has four starts and is go . " All around him in the cockpit various switches , buttons , and monitors flashed to life . " Primary and secondary power is at full . " Ooryl Qrygg , his Gand wingman , reported similar start-up success in a high-pitched voice . " Green Two is operational . " Green Three and Four checked in , then the external screens came alive projecting an empty starfield . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The green and white R2 unit seated behind Corran hooted , then the navdata spilled out over . Corran 's main monitor He punched a button sending the same coordinates out to the other pilots in Green Flight . " Go to light speed and rendezvous on the Redemption . " As Corran engaged the X-wing 's hyperdrive , the stars elongated themselves into white cylinders , then snapped back into pinpoints and began to revolve slowly , transforming themselves into a tunnel of white light . Corran fought the urge to use the stick to compensate for the roll . In space , and especially hyperspace , up and down were relative . How his ship moved through hyperspace did n't really matter -- as long as it remained on the course Whistler had calculated and had attained sufficient velocity before entering hyperspace , he 'd arrive intact . Flying into a black hole would actually make this run easier . Every pilot dreaded the Redemption run . The scenario was based on an Imperial attack on evacuation ships back before the first Death Star had been destroyed . While the Redemption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dock and off-load wounded , the Imperial frigate Warspite danced around the system and dumped TIE fighters and bombers out to do as much damage as they could . The bombers , with a full load of missiles , could do a lot of damage . All the pilots called the Redemption scenario by another name : the Requiem scenario . The Warspite would only deploy four starfighters and a half-dozen bombers -- known in pilot slang as " eyeballs " and " dupes " respectively --  but it would do so in a pattern that made it all but impossible for the pilots to save the Korolev . The corvette was just one big target , and the TIE bombers had no trouble unloading all their missiles into it . Stellar pinpoints elongated again as the fighter came out of hyperspace . Off to the port side Corran saw the Redemption . Moments later Whistler reported that the other fighters and all three Medevac shuttles had arrived . The fighters checked in and the first shuttle began its docking maneuver with the Redemption . " Green One , this is Green Four . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , or are we doing something fancy ? " Corran hesitated before answering . By book , Nawara Ven had referred to the general wisdom about the scenario . It stated that one pilot should play fleethund and race out to engage the first TIE flight while the other three fighters remained in close as backup . As long as three fighters stayed at home , it appeared , the Warspite dropped ships off at a considerable distance from the Korolev . When they did n't , it got bolder and the whole scenario became very bloody . The problem with going by the book was that it was n't a very good strategy . It meant one pilot had to deal with five TIEs -- two eyeballs and three dupes -- all by himself , then turn around and engage five more . Even with them coming in waves , the chances of being able to succeed against those odds were slim . Doing it any other way was disastrous . Besides , what loyal son of Corellia ever had any use for odds ? " By the book . Keep the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Done . Good luck . " " Thanks . " Corran reached up with his right hand and pressed it against the lucky charm he wore on a chain around his neck . Though he could barely feel the coin through his gloves and the thick material of his flight suit , the familiar sensation of the metal resting against his breastbone brought a smile to his face . It worked for you a lot , Dad , let 's hope all its luck has n't run out yet . Isle openly acknowledged that he 'd been depending quite a bit on luck to see him through the difficulties of settling in with the Alliance forces . Learning the slang took some work --  moving from calling TIE starfighters " eyeballs " to calling Interceptors " squints " made a certain amount of sense , but many other terms had been born of logic that escaped him . Everything about the Rebellion seemed odd in comparison to his previous life and fitting in had not been easy . Nor will be winning this scenario . The Korolev materialized and moved toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd mulled the scenario over in his mind time and time again . In previous runs , when he served as a home guard to someone else 's fleethund , he 'd had Whistler record traces on the TIE timing patterns , flight styles , and attack vectors . While different cadets flew the TIE half of the simulations , the craft dictated their performance and a lot of their initial run sequence had been preprogrammed . A sharp squawk from Whistler alerted Corran to the Warspite 's arrival . " Great , eleven kicks aft . " Pulling the stick around to the right , Corran brought the X-wing into a wide turn . At the end of it he punched the throttle up to full power . Hitting another switch up to the right , he locked the S-foils into attack position . " Green One engaging . " Rhysati 's voice came cool and strong through the radio . " Be all over them like drool on a Hutt . " " I 'll do my best , Green Three . " Corran smiled and waggled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out toward the Warspite . Whistler announced the appearance of three TIE bombers with a low tone , then brought the sound up as two TIE fighters joined them . " Whistler , tag the bombers as targets one , two , and three . " As the R2 unit complied with that order , Corran pushed shield power full to front and brought his laser targeting program up on the main monitor . With his left hand he adjusted the sighting calibration knob on the stick and got the two fighters . Good , looks like three klicks between the eyeballs and the bombers . Corran 's right hand again brushed the coin beneath his flight suit . He took a deep breath , exhaled slowly , then settled his hand on the stick and let his thumb hover over the firing button . At two klicks the heads-up display painted a yellow box around the lead TIE fighter . The box went green as the fighter 's image locked into the HUD 's targeting cross and Whistler 's shrill bleat filled the cockpit . Corran 's thumb hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead fighter . The first set missed but the second and third blasted through the spherical cockpit . The hexagonal solar panels snapped off and spun forward through space while the ion engines exploded into an expanding ball of incandescent gas . Corran kicked the X-wing up in a ninety-degree snap-roll and sliced through the center of the explosion . Laser fire from the second fighter lit up his forward shields , making it impossible for him to get a good visual line on the TIE . Whistler yowled , complaining about being a target . Corran hurried a shot and knew he hit , but the TIE flashed past and continued on in at the Korolev . Time to write a new chapter for the book on the Requiem scenario . Corran throttled hack almost all the way to zero and let the X-wing decelerate . " Whistler , bring up target one . " The image of the first TIE bomber filled his monitor . Corran switched over to proton torpedo target control . The HUD changed to a larger box and Whistler began beeping as he worked supplying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Green One , your velocity is down to one percent . Do you need help ? " " Negative , Green Two . " " Corran , what are you doing ? " " Making the book a short story . " I hope . The HUD went red and Whistler 's tone became constant . Corran punched the button and launched the first missile . " Acquire target two . " The HUD flashed yellow , then red , and the pilot launched the second missile . Numbers scrolled away to zero as the missiles streaked in at their targets . Two kilometers away the first missile hit , shredding the first TIE bomber . Seconds later the second missile hit its target . A novalike explosion lit the simulator 's cockpit , then melted into the blackness of space . " Acquire target three . " Even as he gave the order he knew the rate of closure between the bomber and his ship would make the last missile shot all but impossible . " Cancel three . " Corran throttled up again as the third bomber sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to laser targeting and climbed right up on the bomber 's stern The dupe 's pilot tried to evade him . He juked the double-hulled ship to the left , then started a long turn to the right , but Corran was of no mind to lose him . He cut his speed , which kept the bomber in front of him , then followed it in its turn . As he leveled out again on its tail , he triggered two laser bursts and the targeting computer reported hull damage . The bomber 's right wing came up in a roll and Corran did the same thing . Had he continued to fly level , the X-wing 's lasers would have passed on either side of the bomber 's fuselage , giving the bomber a few seconds more of life . Keeping the bomber centered in his crosshairs , Corran hit twice more and the bulky craft disintegrated before him . Pushing his throttle to full , Corran scanned for the fighter he 'd missed . He found it two klicks out and going in toward the Korolev . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the corvette , eighteen kilometers away . Damn , tile bomber took more time than I had to give it . He brought the torpedo targeting program back up and locked on to the remaining fighter . The HUD seemed to take forever before it went red and acquired a lock . Corran fired a missile and watched it blast through the fighter , then turned his attention to the new TlEs . " Green One , do you want us to engage ? " Corran shook his head . " Negative , Two . Warspite is still here and could dump another flight . " He sighed . " Move to intercept the fighters , but do n't go beyond a klick from the Korolev . " " On it . " Good , they can tie the fighters up while I dust these devils . Corran studied the navigational data Whistler was giving him . The Korolev , the bombers , and his X-wing formed a shrinking triangle . If he flew directly at the bombers he would end up flying in an arc , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close enough to launch their mis siles at the corvette . That would be less than useless as far as he was concerned . " Whistler , plot me an intercept point six klicks out from the Korolev . " The R2 whistled blithely , as if that calculation was so simple even Corran should have been able to do it in his head . Steering toward it , Corran saw he 'd have just over a minute to deal with the bombers before they were in firing range on the Korolev . Not enough time . Flicking two switches , Corran redirected generator energy from recharging his shields and lasers into the engines . It took the acceleration compensator a second to cycle up , so the ship 's burst of speed pushed Corran back into the padding of his command seat . Taxis better work . " Green One , the Warspite has hyped . Are we released to engage fighters ? " " Affirmative , Three . Go get them . " Corran frowned for a second , knowing his fellow pilots would make short work of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he 'd willingly trade two TlEs for the corvette . Commander Antilles might have gotten them all himself , but then he 's got two Death Stars painted on the side of his X-wing . " Whistler , mark each of the bombers four , five , and six . " Range to intercept was three Licks and he had added thirty seconds to his fighting time . " Acquire foun " The targeting computer showed him to be coming in at a forty-five-degree angle to the flight path of his target , which meant he was way off target . He quickly punched the generator back into recharging lasers and his shields , then pulled even more energy from his quartet of Incom 4L4 fusial thrust engines and shunted it into recharging his weapons and The resource redirection brought his speed down . Corran pulled back on the stick , easing the X-wing into a turn that brought him head-on into the bombers . Tapping the stick to the left , he centered the targeting box on the first of the dupes . The HUD started yellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Acquire five . " The HUD started red and Whistler 's keen echoed through the cockpit . The Corellian fired a second missile . " Acquire six . " Whistler screeched . Corran looked down at his display . Scrolling up the screen , sandwiched between the reports of mlssile hits on the three bombers , he saw a notation about Green Two . " Green Two , report . " " He 's gone , One . " " A fighter got him ? " " No time to chat ... " The radio call from the Twi'lek in Green Four ended in a hiss of static . " Rhysati ? " " Got one , Corran , but this last one is good . " " Hang on . " " I 'll do my best . " " Whistler , acquire six . " The R2 unit hissed . The last bomber had already shot past the intercept point and was bearing in on the Korolev . The pilot had the widebodied craft slowly spinning , making it a difficult target for a missile lock . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present large enough of a target that even a rolling ship could get a lock on it . And once he has that lock , the Korolev is so much space junk . Corran switched back to lasers and pushed his X-wing forward . Even though two Licks separated them , he triggered a couple of laser blasts . He knew his chances of hitting were not good at that range , but the light from the bolts wou shoot past the TIE and give the pilot something to think about . And I want him thinking about me , not that nerf-vette grazing there . Corran redirected all power back into the engines and shot forward . Two more laser blasts caused the TIE bomber to shy a bit , but it had pushed into target-acquisition range . The ship 's roll began to slow as the pilot fixated on his target , then as Corran brought his lasers to bear , the bomber jinked and cut away to port . The Corellian 's eyes narrowed .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
