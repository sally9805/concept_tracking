<p> The record industry loves to service the upscale end of its market with deluxe boxed sets . Compiling these expensive little sonic temples often brings out the best creative efforts of graphic artists , while the reissue producers lovingly piece together the audio program and writers wax euphoric in accompanying scholarly monographs . <p> A boxed set should be more than greatest hits on steroids . The music must be important , able to carry the weight of a multidisc retrospective . The selections have to range from masterpieces to sketches , laying bare in some previously undisclosed manner the creative process behind the work . The truly excellent boxes  --  the Ella Fitzgerald songbook set , the James Brown box , or the Beach Boys collection  --  all have a way of enshrining and examining the music they contain at the same time . <p> This year 's crop ranges from a possibly gratuitous 13-disc repackaging of the ' 70s Aerosmith rock catalog to 10 discs in two sets devoted to the superior piano playing of jazz great Bud Powell . Top-of- the-class honors go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneer Sam Cooke . <p> TOP PICK <p> . <p> Sam Cooke 's Mastery <p> Supremely Celebrated <p> VARIOUS ARTISTS : Sam Cooke 's SAR Records Story 1959-1963 Abkco , two discs , $ 35.98 / 5 STARS <p> This two-disc set  --  an exquisite package that eloquently attests to Sam Cooke 's supreme soul architecture  --  draws from the long-forgotten vaults of Cooke 's SAR Records , a label he operated through the early ' 60s while he made his own records for RCA Victor . <p> Acting as producer and songwriter , Cooke supervised an extensive series of soul and gospel recordings . His role is memorialized on the set via studio chatter where Cooke offers suggestions and directions to the vocalists from the booth . The set also contains a few previously unissued Cooke solo sides and the original demo to his 1957 No. 1 record , " You Send Me . " <p> One disc is devoted to the gospel sides he produced by his former colleagues in the Soul Stirrers , his mentor R.H. Harris and his proteges , the Womack Brothers . The other disc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Simms Twins , Johnnie Morisette , fellow ex-gospeler Johnnie Taylor , Cooke 's brother L.C. Cooke and the Womack Brothers ' r &; b configuration , the Valentinos . <p> These singles may not have proved especially successful in their day  --  although the Valentinos ' " It 's All Over Now " wound up playing a key role in the repertoire of the early Rolling Stones , and the Simms Twins mapped out the essential blueprint to other ' 60s soul duos such as Sam and Dave . But they offer abundant tribute to Cooke 's mastery of both idioms . <p> . <p> ROCK <p> . <p> Some Lost Gems <p> From the Everlys <p> EVERLY BROTHERS : Heartaches &; Harmonies <p> Rhino , four discs , $ 49.99 / 4 STARS <p> Phil and Don Everly singing together , makes an indelible imprint  --  blood harmony . As first-generation rockers , the Everly Brothers enjoyed a longer period of productivity than most of their peers , continuing to work long after they slipped off the charts in the early ' 60s . In fact , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover most of the Everlys ' chart life , the last two may prove the most rewarding portion of the program . <p> As the Everlys sought to find a place in contemporary music from the late ' 60s onward , the brothers never strayed from their own essence . They intuitively picked songs and musical associates that nurtured and spotlighted their special gifts , though virtually nobody noticed . Many of the recordings on disc four , in fact , never have been released since appearing on obscure 45s in the late ' 60s . <p> But from the aching rendition of the Beau Brummels ' " Turn Around " to the majesty of Paul McCartney 's " On the Wings of a Nightingale , " this final disc is the one that gives the set its resonance . As great as " Bye Bye Love , " " Bird Dog , " " Cathy 's Clown " and all the others sound , it is these lost Everlys sides that will bring you back time and again . <p> . <p> A Rock History <p> From Sun Records <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three discs , $ 48.99 / 4 STARS <p> An extraordinarily listenable history lesson , the Sun Records box touches all the right bases , including four of the five Elvis Presley A-sides he cut for the label from 1954 and 1955 . <p> The first disc is devoted to the blues recordings that led Sun founder Sam Phillips to the brink of a musical and cultural revolution  --  Howlin ' Wolf and B.B. King were only two of the great black musicians he recorded in his historic Memphis studios . <p> In the wake of his success with Presley , however , Phillips became the magnet that attracted a new generation of young white Southern musicians who wanted to play this rhythm and blues/country-and- western hybrid that became known as rock and roll . <p> In a few heady years , Carl Perkins , Johnny Cash , Jerry Lee Lewis , Roy Orbison and other Sun musicians would irrevocably change the sound of American music  --  a saga that is carefully detailed across the last two discs of the set . <p> . <p> Thirty Hot Years <p> Of Tina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60s to ' 90s <p> Capitol , three discs , $ 47.99 / 3 STARS <p> The soul survivor and current rock diva remains basically unchanged whether singing in front of the Phil Spector Wall of Sound or the techno-pop burble of " What 's Love Got to Do With It . " <p> During the 30 years chronicled on these discs , Tina Turner is an unwavering force who puts the same raw nerve into the big hits  --  from " Fool in Love " to " I Do n't Want to Fight "  --  as into delightful obscurities such as " Acid Queen " from the " Tommy " movie sound track , and the B- side cover of Prince 's " Let 's Pretend We 're Married . " <p> . <p> Dubious Rarities <p> From the Band <p> THE BAND : Across the Great Divide <p> Capitol , three discs , $ 47.99 / 3 STARS <p> With an erratic catalog boasting few equivalent high points after the masterpiece " Music From Big Pink , " the group 's 1968 debut , the Band box does little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third disc of dubious rarities . <p> Although the early examples of Levon and the Hawks and the outtakes from " The Basement Tapes " with Bob Dylan in the group offer some intriguing glimpses into the story , most of the so-called rarities disc is devoted to live renditions of typical Band repertoire , including five tracks from the Watkins Glen festival and five selections from " The Last Waltz " album . <p> . <p> ' Tapestry ' Recalls <p> Mammoth King Success <p> CAROLE KING : The Ode Collection ( 1968-1976 ) <p> Ode/Epic/Legacy , two discs , $ 29.99 / 2 STARS <p> Embroidered " Tapestry , " this set revolves around the inclusion of the entire contents of her record-breaking 1971 smash , at the time the biggest-selling album ever . <p> Despite the craftsmanship of King 's rather studied songwriting , these often callow ' 70s recordings do n't hold up as well as the work of the Carpenters , pop peers of the period . <p> And , as the second disc makes so evident , the further the mammoth success of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and producer Lou Adler relied on hack Hollywood studio cliches , something they were never that far from to begin with . <p> . <p> Puerile Spirituality <p> And Pompous Pop <p> MOODY BLUES : Time Traveller <p> Polydor , five discs , $ 57.99 / 2 STARS <p> Pink Floyd without tears and an obvious influence on spoof rockers Spinal Tap , the Moody Blues has long combined puerile spirituality and an overblown , some might say pompous , pop sound that hardly wears well over an entire album , let alone five compact discs . <p> Beginning with the 1967 " concept " album , " Days of Future Passed " ( and ignoring the British Invasion-era Moodies of " Go Now " ) , the set draws the first four discs from the group 's extensive catalog , while the fifth " bonus " disc adds a new studio track to a recent concert recording . <p> . <p> Plenty of Ore <p> Among the Nuggets <p> AEROSMITH : Box of Fire <p> Columbia , 13 discs , $ 119.98 / 2 STARS <p> Although this complete catalog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , the first act in the career of the Boston-based hard-rock heroes has been assembled into a single Aerosmithsonian , with the addition of one bonus disc composed of assorted live tracks and other pieces missing from the regulation issue albums from the ' 70s . Anybody who really needed this probably already has it , and a lot of ore comes along with the nuggets in early Aerosmith , so beware . It 's not like these guys were Led Zeppelin or anything . <p> . <p> Three Short Discs <p> Mix Flimsy Whimsy <p> VARIOUS ARTISTS : The Buddah Box <p> ESX Entertainment , three discs , $ 48.99 / 1 STAR <p> If the tape libraries of this crucible of bubblegum had been plumbed for a detailed history of the studio-conceived pop in which the label first specialized , there might have been a cogent package somewhere in there . But to present three quite short discs mixing the flimsy whimsy of the 1910 Fruitgum Company with Top 40 stylings of Gladys Knight and the Pips and the pseudo disco of the Andrea True Connection does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> SOUL/R &B; <p> . <p> Vital Soul Records <p> Right Up to the End <p> VARIOUS ARTISTS : The Complete Stax/Volt Singles 1972-1975 <p> Stax , 10 discs $ 140 / 4 STARS <p> The third and final installment of the monumental 28-disc project collating 16 years of singles released by the innovative Memphis soul label may lack the cultural imperative of the first edition with the revered Otis Redding records present , but the label clearly continued to put out vital , unique soul records right up to the end , as evidenced by this set . <p> Instead of Otis , Sam and Dave and Booker T. and the MGs , the Stax of this box belongs to Isaac Hayes , the Staple Singers , Johnnie Taylor , Albert King and Carla Thomas . There are some potent incidental hits from Shirley Brown ( " Woman to Woman " ) , Mel and Tim ( " Starting All Over Again " ) , the Dramatics ( " In the Rain " ) and others . Little-known figures emerge from the tracks  --  Frederick Knight , Eric Mercury  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscure gems dot every disc , from the Soul Children 's " Hearsay " to Hot Sauce 's " What Do You See in Her " to Bessie Banks ' " Try to Leave If You Can . " <p> . <p> Succulent Collection <p> Of Soul Music <p> VARIOUS ARTISTS : The Sue Records Story : The Sound of Soul <p> EMI , four discs , $ 50.99 4 STARS <p> Asurprisingly succulent collection of soul music from a New York-based label whose chart success may have been limited , but whose vaults proved a treasure trove of ' 60s r &; b nuggets , " The Sue Records Story " runs far deeper than such modest hits as Ike and Tina Turner 's " Fool in Love , " Barbara George 's " I Know " or Charlie and Inez Foxx 's " Mockingbird . " <p> While occasionally familiar names such as Ocie ( O.C. ) Smith , Don Covay and Bill Doggett dot the four discs , they are not represented by their biggest hits . But the box supplies a wealth of outstanding genre pieces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sax works obviously provided by King Curtis ) with uptown Motown knockoffs , plus the odd Jimmy McGriff organ specialty . <p> . <p> Tempts Sink Into <p> Morass of Banality <p> THE TEMPTATIONS : Emperors of Soul <p> Motown , five discs , $ 69.99 3 STARS <p> The long and prolific career of the Motown standard bearers is finely detailed over these five discs on a set that , like the group 's illustrious career , lasts longer than proves productive . Despite the marvels and majesty of the early years under the baton of producer-songwriter Smokey Robinson , the Tempts sink into a morass of banality by discs four and five . <p> . <p> From Louis Jordan <p> To the Spinners <p> VARIOUS ARTISTS : The R &B; Box : 30 Years of Rhythm and Blues <p> Rhino , six discs , $ 73.99 / 3 STARS <p> Any attempt to package three decades of music this rich on a scant six CDs is bound to fall short , and this Rhino set lacks the focus of the label 's wonderful doo-wop box that served as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field , the set is riddled with questionable choices and omits many towering landmarks . On the other hand , as a haphazard oldies-but-goodies set , there is n't a turkey in the bunch , as the massive tome sweeps from Louis Jordan in the ' 40s to the Spinners in the ' 70s . <p> . <p> COUNTRY <p> . <p> High-Mountain Ditties <p> With Religious Songs <p> BILL MONROE : The Music of Bill Monroe from 1936 to 1994 <p> MCA , four discs , $ 43.99 / 4 STARS <p> Monroe pretty much invented bluegrass , country music 's backwoods cousin whose instrumental flights frequently echo the texture of great small- combo jazz . With the deeply soulful high mountain harmonies attached to often religious songs , mandolinist-vocalist Monroe sculpted a unique sound that resonated in far corners of the music world . <p> Although the set samples the beginnings of his recording career in the late ' 30s and through the ' 40s with other labels , the bulk of this material comes from an association with Decca Records that began in 1950 . <p> . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARTISTS : From the Vaults : Decca Country Classics 1934-1973 <p> MCA , three discs , $ 35.99 / 2 STARS <p> This chronological hodgepodge draws from some of the most distinguished sessions in Nashville history , veering madly from the 1935 trick fiddling of " Listen to the Mockingbird " by Curley Fox to the aching 1970 Loretta Lynn-Conway Twitty duet , " Afer the Fire Is Gone . " <p> As an account of a significant label 's country music history  --  featuring important contributions by Ernest Tubb , Patsy Cline , Kitty Wells , Webb Pierce , Red Foley and others  --  it offers a cursory overview . But , by limiting individuals ' contributions to one track apiece , many significant recordings are sacrificed in favor of decidedly minor , albeit amusing , pieces . <p> . <p> Loretta Lynn Set <p> Skimps on Highlights <p> LORETTA LYNN : Honky Tonk Girl : The Loretta Lynn Collection <p> MCA , three discs , $ 35.99 / 2 STARS <p> The raw power of her voice allowed Lynn to intermittently surmount the undistinguished , occasionally insipid formulaic material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often enough . At her best , she can wring considerable feeling out of bathetic , almost trite lyrics or wax ebullient with a certain raunchy edge . The highlights of this package rank among the finest works of country music of the era , but come too infrequently . <p> . <p> Occasional Flashes <p> Of Poignancy <p> CONWAY TWITTY : The Conway Twitty Collection <p> MCA , four discs , $ 43.99 / 2 STARS <p> Once his transformation from authentic Arkansas rockabilly wild man was complete , Twitty descended into a tepid routine of middle-aged sex idol . He indulged in some of the most blatantly sensual material of ' 70s country and rang up a record number of No. 1 country hits . But hemmed in by this rather strict character role , Twitty only occasionally flashed the kind of poignant vocal chops he flexed on his final recording , the 1994 duet with soul man Sam Moore from a set of country/r &; b duets . <p> . <p> JAZZ <p> . <p> Rich Collection <p> Of American Music <p> LOUIS ARMSTRONG : Portrait of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discs , $ 53.99 / 4 STARS <p> These four discs chronicle musical giant Armstrong'smost creative period , when he took early jazz into previously unexplored realms . Not only does the box examine his historic Hot Five sessions of the late ' 20s and Armstrong 's early big- band recordings , but it scrupulously samples his work as a sideman with artists as diverse as pioneer New Orleans clarinetist Johnny Dodds , blues singers Bessie Smith and Chippie Hill and country singer Jimmie Rodgers  --  an extraordinarily rich collection of some of the most vital American music ever recorded . <p> . <p> A Piano Master <p> Gets His Due <p> BUD POWELL : The Complete Bud Powell on Verve <p> Verve , six discs , $ 78.99 / 4 STARS <p> . <p> The Complete Blue Note and Roost Recordings <p> Blue Note , four discs , $ 55.99 / 4 STARS <p> Bebop piano genius Bud Powell , model for the expatriate jazz musician fictionalized in the film " ' Round Midnight , " is the subject of two major retrospectives delving deeply into his landmark recordings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains his most famed solo sessions , invariably incandescent , along with trio settings . <p> While his later sessions for Blue Note occasionally display a faltering touch , as his personal problems began to interfere with his performance , he is never less than intense and his apparent anguish often illuminates some of the more raw passages . <p> . <p> The Wilderness Years <p> Of Joe Henderson <p> JOE HENDERSON : The Milestone Years <p> Milestone , eight discs , $ 125.99 / 3 STARS <p> More like the wilderness years for the late blooming best-seller , the Joe Henderson collection compiles almost 10 years of recordings , while the abundantly talented instrumentalist searched for a style that would strike a resonant chord with the jazz public . From experimental eeks and squeaks to smooth bossa nova outings , Henderson put his enormous skills to work into a patchwork of contexts , notably some hard-bopping early sessions and a wild , freewheeling 1971 live Tokyo date with Japanese sidemen . <p> . <p> OTHER <p> . <p> Hectic Harangues <p> From the Wacked-Out <p> MONTY PYTHON : The Monty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 59.99 / 3 STARS <p> Without the visual component , these selections from nine albums by England 's wacked-out TV crowd often tend toward frenetic and confusing , but Pythonites will delight in the verbal antics  --  Eric Idle raging against packaged vacations , Michael Palin and John Cleese in the immortal pet shop sketch or Terry Jones squawking in his ridiculous falsetto . With all the hectic harangues interspersed with inspired musical idiocy  --  from the Spam song to " Here Comes Another One "  --  the anthologized albums stride along on a pace all their own , owing nothing to the televised version . <p> . <p> Sinatra Sings <p> For Servicemen Only <p> FRANK SINATRA : The V-Discs <p> Columbia/Legacy , two discs , $ 29.99 / 2 STARS <p> The missing piece from last year 's massive 12-CD " The Columbia Years " box , these 53 selections were released originally only to U.S. servicemen during World War II , part of a government morale program . Drawn largely from rehearsal sessions and radio broadcasts ( although he did cut one major studio session specifically for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a footnote to his ' 40s recording career . Material tended toward the ripely sentimental and saccharine orchestrations typical of the " sweet " bands of the period . <p> . <p> Gorgeous and Powerful <p> Solos From the ' 50s <p> ANDRES SEGOVIA : A Centenary Celebration <p> MCA/Decca , four discs / 2 STARS <p> The great Spanish classical guitarist was one of the best-selling recording artists of his field and these selections , largely recorded throughout the ' 50s , easily demonstrate why . When he plays solo , the delicacy of the melodies he spins is gorgeous and powerful . He fares less well when he recorded with orchestrations , and the fourth disc , an autobiographical narrative , is unlikely to receive more than a curiosity airing by purchasers . <p> . <p> A Lengthy Mantra <p> From Allen Ginsberg <p> ALLEN GINSBERG : Holy Soul Jelly Roll Poems and Songs 1949-1993 <p> Rhino/Word Beat , four discs , $ 48.99 / 2 STARS <p> Poet Ginsberg drones on and on  --  and on and on  --  in this endless collection of sometimes rather amateurish home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the realm of poetry , was assembled by producer Hal Wilner with the kind of eye for detail that the boxed-set format allows , an extraordinary feat of dedication to some rather extreme arcana.
