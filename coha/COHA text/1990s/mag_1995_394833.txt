A year from now , the first new close-up views in about two decades of Jupiter 's moon Io will trickle back from the Galileo spacecraft . Half a billion miles from Earth , Io , the size of our own Moon , has a rocky volcanic surface , noxious atmosphere , sulfurous frosts , and fountains of fiery lava . A scene out of Dante 's hell ? Actually , Io is a paradise  --  to a volcanololgist . Volcanos let scientists look inside a planet or moon to see what makes it go . Io is continuously active and scientists have been following its eruptions remotely from Earth ( see " The Violent Volcanos of Io , " May 1993 ) . Although Galileo 's arrival is still a year away , a recent discovery involving images from the Voyager encounters of 15 years ago is giving planetary geologists a " sneak preview " of this Jovian moon . Io is a bizarre world , where huge volcanic plumes arc hundreds of kilometers into the airless sky . These , the only known active volcanos beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . Despite the spectacular power driving these explosive eruptions , however , most of Io 's extremely young surface has been shaped by quieter extrusions of molten lava . Volcanologists such as myself are drawn to study these features because many of Io 's volcanic flows and shallow calderas resemble volcanic structures on Mars and Earth . In some ways familiar to us , Io 's features also show major differences . Huge volcanic piles , like Olympus Mons on Mars , are absent . Io 's active volcanos spew sulfur and sulfur dioxide , which color the surface pale yellow and orange . Io 's lava flows often have bright frosts associated with them because the sulfurous vapor rapidly condenses in the icy vacuum . While Io 's size and density resemble those of Earth 's Moon , the bright yellowish frosts , extensive sulfur-coated plains , and ongoing volcanic activity say that Io is fundamentally different . It 's easy to compile a list of questions about Io . How long do eruptions last ? Are the lava flows molten silicate rock like the dark basalts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River gorge ? Or are they made of sulfur compounds in some way related to the plumes ? Does flow composition change with time ? What is Io 's crust made of ? But answers are n't so easy to come by . A few mountains appear to rise abruptly from the surrounding featureless plains . This indicates that Io is at least partly composed of stiff rock rather than weak sulfur , which would flatten out under the weight . But we do not know how these mountains relate to the volcanos or the plumes or how they came to be so high . Detailed maps of Io 's composition must await the arrival of Galileo . For the past year , however , I have been studying Io 's topography using old Voyager data to learn about its crust . It 's tougher than you think to extract topography from a photo of a planetary surface . On some , the play of light and shadow betrays topography clearly . While this works for a few locations on Io , the extremely complex patterns of albedo and color intrinsic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas . This is where stereo imaging can literally change our perception of a planet . Humans use stereo vision to navigate in daily life . Your eyes view the scene in front of you from two slightly different perspectives ; the brain combines the two images and instantaneously maps the relative displacements , or parallax , of objects , creating a stereo model of the scene in your head . We do it easily and subconsciously , but it 's one of the most complex operations the brain performs . For geologists studying Earth , stereo aerial photography is a key mapping tool . But until last year , planetary scientists were unaware that usable stereo images of Io even existed . Both Voyager spacecraft flew past Io too far away to take stereo views in the conventional sense . However , when Voyager 2 passed within 25,000 kilometers of Io in July 1979 , its view of the moon changed rapidly over the course of about three hours , from an equatorial to a polar view . Images from these radically different perspectives yield spectacular stereo views of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height of many of Io 's volcanos and map the global distribution of its mountains for the first time . The most prominent volcanic landforms on Io are the so-called shield volcanos , created when multiple long , narrow lava flows radiate outward from a central vent , building a broad cone-shaped edifice . Many of Io 's shields resemble the flows flanking terrestrial volcanos , such as Mt . Etna in Sicily . Ra Patera is a typical Ionian shield volcano . At least if a dozen dark flows , up to 300 kilometers long , radiate from a single dark vent . The yellow and orange colors and lengths of these flows suggest that they could be composed of sulfur . Stereo images reveal that the central part of Ra Patera is only 2 to 3 km higher than the surrounding plains ; the average surface slopes a little less than 1deg . These contrast with other large volcanos in the solar system such as Hawaii 's Mauna Loa ( height 9 km ) which has slopes averaging 6deg , Mt . Fuji ( 4 km ) with 25deg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have slopes of 3deg to 15deg and heights up to 23 km . But maybe the slopes are misleading . It 's possible that Ra Patera was originally much higher and steeper but that the warm interior of Io is so soft that the crust gave way under the weight . Hawaii 's volcanos are actually twice as thick as they appear because the ocean floor has subsided several kilometers due to their weight . We do n't , however , see evidence of subsidence , such as fracturing or warping , in the area around Ra Patera . The relatively flat slopes of Ra Patera suggest that its lavas , compared to most terrestrial basalts , were very fluid : a consistency like that of slightly chilled molasses . Does this mean they are composed of sulfur ? It 's difficult to say  --  basaltic lavas on the lunar maria traveled for several hundred kilometers on slopes even shallower than those on Ra Patera . The flows on Ra could be composed of basalt similar to the lavas that formed Mauna Loa . One way to get long flows with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load it with iron or magnesium . A high iron content in Ionian lavas , if confirmed , would have important implications for Io 's bulk internal composition . Conceivably , these may have been very-low-silica lavas , such as carbonatite or even sodium sulfide . While humans can usually get out of the way of most lava flows , the Ra flows may have been very fast indeed  --  perhaps like an unusual Hawaiian flow of 1801 that traveled at almost 30 miles per hour . Some flows in other areas of Io have a thicker , more massive structure , indicating they were rather viscous , like raspberry jam . Unfortunately , Voyager saw few flows of this type in stereo . The most prominent topographic feature in the Ra Patera region is a complex flow-like ridge structure extending some 500 km to the east and north . This distinctive deposit is several hundred meters thicker than any of the narrow ribbon-like flows . Within this flow the stereo imagery also reveals a prominent peak more than 4 km high just north of a small volcanic pit or caldera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this complex flow appear to be eroded , suggesting it may be relatively old . This implies the material extruded from Ra Patera underwent a radical change either in composition or temperature . Landslides occur on many planets and Io is no exception . The largest lies at the base of Euboea Montes , an unusual mountain 9 km high and over 250 km long . The western face of the mountain is a smooth , uniform surface tilted at 10deg . A hummocky , ridged deposit a little over 2 km thick lies at the base of the slope and extends outward some 70 km . There 's no evidence this deposit is volcanic . Rather , stereo images support the idea that Euboea Montes is a block of Io 's crust that was pushed up ward at least 9 km and tilted to one side . The hummocky material apparently slid off the top of the block toward the northwest , forming a chaotic mass at its base . It is among the largest landslides in the solar system . What forced this massive block upward is a mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeup of Io . The upper crust may be layered , with a thin , weaker layer overlying a stronger one . Asked to speculate on the composition of the weak layer , I might , including sulfur . Another unusual feature of interest is Loki Patera , a large horseshoe-shaped dark spot just south of Loki , a prominent volcanic plume . In 1979 Voyager discovered that Loki Patera is a thermal hot spot and it continues to be hot even today . One scenario has proposed that the dark spot is actually the surface of a molten sulfur lake , and the small polygonal bright features within it are " lava-bergs " floating in the lake . The highest resolution images of Loki Patera reveal no topography at all . By using a slightly lower resolution but oblique image together with the better images , we have discovered that a wall or scarp a few kilometers high forms the northwest shore of the lake . ( The scarp eluded detection in the best images as they were taken from almost directly overhead . ) The scarp coincides with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loki Patera has eroded or cut into a considerable thickness of ash and debris deposited by the Loki plume . Although the dark spot could be a lake of molten sulfur or silicates , Loki 's cliffs suggest the surrounding plains at least are composed of stiffer silicate-rich materials more common on Earth . Sulfur is a very weak material compared to most rocks and by itself could n't support the wall surrounding the lake . These stereo images can reveal many new features of Io 's geology and history but can not in themselves answer the most fundamental questions . They have , however , revealed processes such as landslides and have helped us map the dimensions of major geologic features and let us constrain the physical properties of Io 's lavas . These can be extremely fluid or rather sticky , a range of flow properties that is consistent with a terrestrial-like silicate interior yet allows for significant sulfur ( or other ) volcanism . When Galileo finally arrives , the search will be on for these and even more exotic compositions . <p>      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
