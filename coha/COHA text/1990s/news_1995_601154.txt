<p> Amendment I. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise therof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press , or the right of the people to peaceable assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances Sticks and stones  --  and bombs  --  can break our bones . But words , we are taught , can never hurt us . <p> Or can they ? <p> The terrorist bombing in Oklahoma City has triggered new debate over one of the oldest quandaries of our democracy : When is our cherished freedom of speech too free ? Can angry , vile , blood-boiling speech  --  Newsweek called it " toxic speech " last week  --  trigger violence ? And if it does , should it be restricted  --  or even censored ? <p> Under the protective cover of the First Amendment , anyone can freely broadcast recipes for explosives on the Internet or even offer rationales for the Oklahoma City bombers , such as the fight against an oppressive government . Militias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread shadowy conspiracy theories linking public figures to murder and mayhem . <p> Talk show host G. Gordon Liddy advises radio listeners to aim for the head at invading federal agents  --  then reconsiders and suggests shots to the torso , a bigger target . <p> The printed word can be virulent , too . With regularity , hate-filled books , brochures and bumper stickers are found strewn through the houses or the pasts of accused zealots : Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols , suspects in the Oklahoma bombing ; Francisco Duran , who shot up the White House last year ; and the activists accused of shooting abortion doctors last year . <p> In the days since the April 19 bombing , President Clinton has encouraged debate over the effect of violent words in today 's society  --  and what to do about it . " Bitter words have consequences , " he told an audience in Minnesota April 24 . In the end Clinton , who once taught constitutional law at the University of Arkansas , offered the traditional constitutional solution : under the First Amendment , the cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of us who do not agree with the purveyors of hatred and division , " Clinton said , " I remind you that we have freedom of speech , too . . . . It is time we all stood up and spoke against that kind of reckless speech and behavior . " <p> But in a climate of increasing hate and violence , is that optimistic remedy  --  which relies on the idealistic view that the good speech will drive out the bad  --  enough ? <p> Some legal theorists think not . <p> " Frozen at the First Amendment bulkhead , we watch the rising tide of racial hatred wash over our schools and workplaces , " says Mari Matsuda of Georgetown law school . " When the legal system offers no redress for that real harm , it perpetuates racism . " <p> Amitai Etzioni of George Washington University says he thinks that violent speech today necessitates a " small , carefully calibrated adjustment " in First Amendment doctrine  --  one that would make it illegal to " teach people how to kill better . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hearing today on bomb-making information distributed on the Internet . Sen. Arlen Specter , R-Pa. , chairman of the subcommitee , says he wants to see if the publication and distribution of such information can be limited . <p> But beyond that , Etzioni acknowledges , there is little that can be done : " You control such speech , not by law , but by the forces of the community . " <p> It seems clear that under First Amendment doctrine that has been ratified by both liberals and conservatives on the Supreme Court , not much can be done about hateful speech  --  a fact celebrated by some , lamented by others . <p> One reason it 's so hard to restrict or censor toxic speech is the difficulty of proving  --  before or after  --  that speech actually causes illegal action . <p> In recent years , various groups have sought to draw the connection between pornography and rape , television violence and aggression , rap music and cop killers . Virtually all these efforts have failed  --  in the courts and in academia . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University law professor R. Kent Greenawalt . " On the other hand , it 's also plausible to argue that this speech allows people to blow off steam and talk , rather than act . " <p> Because free speech is so valued , and the causal link between speech and action is so hard to prove , the U.S. Supreme Court has drawn its line in the sand more broadly than any other democracy . <p> In the 1969 case of Brandenburg vs . Ohio , the high court reversed the conviction of a Ku Klux Klan leader prosecuted under an Ohio law forbidding advocacy of lawlessness . The court unanimously agreed that speech can be restricted only when it is " directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action . " <p> Under the test of " imminent lawless action "  --  sustained by the court as recently as two years ago  --  only the most in-your-face threats of immediate violence can be prosecuted . <p> The idle musings of a talk show host , the hate-filled pamphlet of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerated under this formulation . Even efforts to penalize hate speech on campuses , pursued just a few years ago , have withered in the wake of Supreme Court rulings . <p> Other democracies , with pasts shattered by hate , or with a different take on freedom of speech , have found ways to restrict toxic speech . <p> Germany , still mindful of its Third Reich past , has outlawed the Nazi party , Nazi propaganda and several neo-Nazi groups . German laws also bar the use of Nazi symbols and outlaw the assertion that the Holocaust never happened . <p> France , Great Britain , India and Indonesia are among the many countries that criminalize threatening speech . <p> Closer to home , Canada outlaws hateful speech  --  even though its 1982 charter of rights strongly protects free speech . The government has shut down telephone hate lines and prosecuted a man for teaching that the Holocaust did not happen . <p> " It is your country that is the odd man out , you have to remember , not the rest of the world , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission . " We think there 's a distinction between debate , however rough , and hateful propaganda . " <p> A treaty known as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires participating countries to prohibit , among other things , " any advocacy of national , racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination , hostility or violence . " <p> The United States has ratified the covenant overall - but noted its reservations about that provision . <p> The unique tolerance of the United States is something to be proud of , suggests Holly Cartner of Human Rights Watch . In other countries , she says , laws restricting speech " frequently ( have ) been turned around and used by governments against their political opponents . " <p> America should resist the current temptation to clamp down on hateful speech , says Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe . " The fact that the electronic media give an incredibly powerful megaphone to this disfavored speech does n't justify anything more than the government using the bully pulpit , as President Clinton has done . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the experience they have had in the past , " he adds . " When will we in the United States have had enough experiences to justify the same kind of restrictions ? I do n't know , but we are not there yet . " <p> Contributing : Lori Sharn
