<p> Stupid prosecutor 's trick of the month  --  and the competition is fierce for this one  --  goes to the assistant state attorney in the 2 Live Crew case who said one of the jurors , a 76-year-old retired professor , was trouble from Day One . " She was a sociologist , and I do n't like sociologists , " Pedro Dijols said . " They try to reason things out too much . " <p> Now there 's an indictment if I ever heard one . You let people go reasoning things out , next thing you know they 'll be using logic . And before you know it the place will be overrun with common sense and then where will we be ? <p> In the jury room , that 's where . <p> I confess : Like everyone else , I thought the Mapplethorpe jury was going to convict , and that the 2 Live Crew panel would do the same . I pictured them as children , listening to a prosecutor saying : " This is obscene . Why ? Because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see photographs of things they never imagined took place and did n't want to look at , and respond " guilty . " I thought the other would hear nasty , misogynous violent rap lyrics , and ignore the fact that rock-and-roll mirrors society , and often the dregs of society at that . <p> Which only goes to show that I had forgotten the blessed jury system , the only thing in America that still sometimes works . <p> " I would n't want my case decided by 12 people too stupid to get out of jury duty , " lawyers sometimes say , cracking wise , underestimating their most important audience . Defense attorneys in the Mapplethorpe case were dismayed that the jury pool consisted largely of people who had no interest in museum-going . The prosecutor was so arrogant in his apparent belief that saying they were dirty pictures made it so that his only real witness was a censorship maven who had written some tunes for Captain Kangaroo . <p> In Miami , things were little better . The lawyers for 2 Live Crew flavored their case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male , you might never understand what the group was trying to do in its music . The prosecutors presented a performance tape of the band so badly recorded that it could have been Michael Jackson , " The Mikado , " or a transmission from the Times Square subway station . <p> And then along came the saving graces . A group of strangers come together as a jury , and for some reason that probably has to do with a distillation of civic responsibility , self-importance and the kind of dedication you can bring to putting together a really difficult jigsaw puzzle in a summer house on a rainy Sunday , they take their mission seriously . Given what lawyers and judges hand them  --  and that 's a big given  --  they try to do the right thing . <p> Some people are still angry that the jury did n't slam Marion Barry , the Mayor of Washington . And some people are still upset that jurors were able to find reasonable doubt in the McMartin preschool case . Those cases , and others like them , remind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the offices of the police crime scene unit . " You have no idea who did this ? " I said to a sergeant . " Oh , we know who did it , " he said . " We just do n't have a case . " <p> In Miami , the jury foreman was philosophical about the fact that the jurors were less bigoted than the leader of 2 Live Crew , who had written them off as too white , too straight , too old . " He stereotyped us , just as certain people were stereotyping him because of his performance , " said the foreman , elevating good sense to an art form . <p> And in Ohio , a warehouse manager on the Mapplethorpe jury said : " It 's like Picasso . Picasso , from what everybody tells me , was an artist . It 's not my cup of tea , I do n't understand it , but if people say it 's art than I have to go along with it . " People have used that quote to attack the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our obscenity standards , which are as murky as the bottom of a kid 's fish tank . What the juror was saying is what I say every time I see a Wagnerian opera : sometimes artistic merit is hard for the layman to fathom . Or , in plain language , there 's no accounting for taste . <p> They sat and they listened to discussions of composition and parody and prurient interest . Then they went into a little room and looked at the prosecution case , the defense case , the judge 's charge and the law , and they went to work . In a country where making a tough decision has receded into the distant mists of our historical past , that is no small accomplishment . " You take away one freedom , " one of the 2 Live Crew jurors reportedly said during deliberations , " and pretty soon they 're all gone . " Put that on a button and I 'll wear it .
