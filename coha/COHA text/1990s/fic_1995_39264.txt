On the day before his fiftieth birthday , Bill Lander received <p> letter from a woman he had never heard of  --  Amber Harding  --  saying she 'd be pleased to come to Wallace to meet him and be his birthday date . She noted the time she 'd arrive on the train and said she 'd have no trouble recognizing him . " I 'll just look for a tall , silent type , " she wrote , but warned that she had modified her appearance some since her ad ran in Soulmates . " I took the plunge , " she said , " and had my hair cut and permed . The color 's the same , " She closed by saying she looked forward to meeting a real cowboy and seeing Wyoming . Her letter was mailed from What Cheer , Iowa , and Bill read it again , certain there had been a mistake . He called Directory Assistance , then Amber Harding , hearing her answering machine playing a musical selection-something that sounded like " Yesterday <p> " There 's been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Bill Lander leaving this message . " He noted the time and date , and left his phone number . <p> He was outside , spreading hay , when it came to him that someone was playing . a birthday trick on him , someone 's idea of a gag . He flung the hay , hitting a heifer , her big eyes regarding him stupidly , her tail flicking at a halo of flies . <p> He had a long list of culprits to choose from . He had lived in Wallace all his life , the townspeople knowing all the particulars about him . He was a bachelor , and friends were always trying to hook him up with someone . They were the ones who were going all out for his birthday . They had rented the Union Hall and hired a local band , promising him he 'd have a night to remember . <p> He got in his pickup and went to the barbershop in town . Ned Jencks grinned broadly at him , saying , " The birthday boy . The big five-oh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're here for a haircut . " <p> " No , " Bill told him . " I 'm here on other business He saw Soulmates on top of a stack of magazines and picked it up . <p> " That 's an interesting publication , " Ned said . <p> " I 'll return it shortly , " Bill said , and prepared to leave . <p> " This is n't a lending library , " Ned shouted . <p> " It 's a joke is what it is , " Bill said , and went to the Busy Bee cafe , knowing he was making matters worse , walking in with the magazine and seeing men sitting at the counter , their heads rising from their breakfast plates to look at him . <p> " Going through the change of life already ? " one of them shouted . " Do n't recollect ever seeing you here on a weekday morning <p> " Had business in town , " Bill said and sat at a booth . <p> It was the spring issue of the magazine , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cover was a picture of a woman named Roxanne in a red blouse , short hair arranged stiffly like a helmet . Roxanne was smiling , holding the collar of <p> stonewashed denim jacket over her right shoulder . The caption beneath her photo said " The happiest woman alive The publication was printed in Montana and boasted an ever-growing readership . In the Editor 's Comments column , someone named the " Love ' a Ranger " talked about time moseying on , waiting for no one . " Choices are a lot better than what you have been seeking every day around you in your town or even the country you happen to be in . Hey , that old system went out the window a long time ago ! Most everyone travels these days and is willing to go the distance . Now , roads are good . Who says you ca n't have it all just like on television ! " <p> Bill skimmed the ads and pictures , annoyed greatly that people meddled in his life and in this pathetic way . Did they think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amber Harding , but her ad was longer than anyone else 's . She started off with a brief description of herself , saying she was petite  --  five foot three  --  and had maintained a desirable weight for years . She had shoulder-length brown hair and was forty , bona and bred in the Midwest . <p> " I 'm not afraid to take on projects of considerable magnitude and complexity . Friends describe me as intelligent , witty , mysterious , a deep thinker , compassionate , gentle , fun-loving , and somewhat guarded . I have an interest in good nutrition , reading labels and taking supplements . I would n't mind meeting a man who cooks and bakes on a regular basis and who is humorous by nature . I like riding horses who do n't offer to buck without advanced warning . I love surprises , not shocks ! Am hoping to hear from interested parties . Only , no inmates , please . " <p> Unlike the other ads , Amber Harding 's listed no occupation , just a box number at the magazine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the ad seemed silly . He looked at the men in the cafe , every one of them married to local women , as if it were they who were afraid of surprises , or afraid of him because he had chosen to remain single and had no complaints . He watched them leave the cafe , one of them giving him the thumbs-up sign and saying , " Looking forward to the party , Bill . Wait till you see the hall . Folks went all out . Yes , sir , they went the distance this time <p> He could pull off a surprise on all of them by not showing up , getting out of town , but he 'd have to live with them for the rest of his life . He wanted to collar someone and say , " It 's no big deal turning fifty , " but cards had been appearing in his mailbox , reminding him that it was a big deal . His own father had died at fifty-two , old and spent , brittle toward the end , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishing land . And here was this Amber Harding , entertaining romantic notions about Wyoming and cowboys . <p> He glanced at the rest of the ads , seeing photographs of women dressed as if they were about to step out for an evening on the town , the men wearing old-fashioned western outfits , their ads insistent on transformations and the desire to settle down and have a second chance after divorces and drinking . These men described themselves as being reborn , finding real values and a longing to live in wide-open places , preferably with like-minded women . <p> Bill distrusted everything the writers said , but continued reading . <p> " Middle-aged man , tall , silent type . Filled with common sense . Has spread . No dependents . Can be outgoing . Realistic , all-around nice guy , average-looking . Been doing the solo act for years . Something 's missing . Desperate to fill other half of team harness I 've been dragging around . In mind , have no one particular . " He saw the name Bill underneath and " Big Horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he muttered , imagining friends and neighbors sitting down to compose such an ad and a letter to Amber Harding . <p> On his way home , he passed the railroad station , a squat , cement building , its outside benches and plaster defaced with crude hearts , names and dates . " If you lived here , " someone had spray-painted , stopping the message at that . <p> Beyond the station was the Union Hall , a few cars in the lot . He sped of raising a plume of gravel and dust . <p> Even though he had neglected most of his daily chores , he went into his house , threw Soulmates in the trash , but could n't shake the portrait of himself depicted in the magazine . He was n't aware of ever telling anyone that something was missing in his life ; most likely , it was their projection . If he had to describe his feelings , it might come out as a kind of contentment , along with the conviction that something dramatic  --  possibly awful  --  was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , he came close to pinning down that feeling . It was in the spring , the first fine day after a hard winter , and he had decided on a horseback ride in the high country . He could 've sworn he heard a woman crying , moaning luxuriously , somewhere behind the rocks . He spurred his horse , and the old bay , resentful and spooked , bucked him , then ran off . He knew some damage had been done to his leg , but he was afraid to look , afraid to move . Then a mountain lion emerged , making that female crying noise . The lion took possession of a boulder , sitting regally on it , its flanks still and chaired , its eyes observing him lying in the damp grass as if patient to watch the spectacle . Bill would long recall the sight of the lion stretching itself on the rock to sleep , a thin white cloud sailing by indifferently , and his own disbelief at the stillness of it all . <p> A sheepman found him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then hefted him upon his shoulders like a bum lamb . During his hospital stay , friends and neighbors visited , signed his cast , and assured him they were seeing to things on his ranch . They brought flowers , homemade food , and get-well cards full of jokes about pretty nurses and goldbricking . Bill forced smiles at the cards , and for the people who seemed to want a tale , he described the accident . " Thought I was a goner , " he 'd say , never mentioning the curious emotion , almost like elation , that had seized him that day . " Figured it was a matter of time before that lion sprang on me The visitors would shake their heads and tell him he was one lucky fellow . <p> He had read of people who had brushes with death , their whole outlook changing afterwards , but when he returned home , everything seemed the same . The cattle moved along in deliberate processions , following the same rutted path to the fields and home again . Every two weeks , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ned Jencks talking about the accident to men in the barbershop who seemed to look at him , then themselves in the mirror , as if to confirm their own good fortune . <p> Sometimes he rode back to the site , stopping always at the place where he had fallen and lying down there to stare at the boulder again , waiting foolishly to see the mountain lion and to feel that solitary excitement . <p> On his way outside to tend to chores , he saw the clipping he had pinned to his refrigerator from one of his trade journals about an autistic woman who had designed a humane apparatus that hugged cattle on their way to slaughter . The woman had such an apparatus in her own home , and a picture showed her being hugged by the machine . " Ca n't get close to humans , " the woman said , insisting that cattle changed her life . Bill wondered about the cattle , thinking it hard on them to get something good just moments before their end . <p> He put the clipping in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harding coming to his home . <p> He hardly slept at all , waiting for his phone to ring , and fretting about enduring the next day . Whenever he looked out the window , he worried about snow , even though it was May . It had been known to happen even in June , and on this night , the sky had a low-slung look to it , no stars , and a hazy gibbous moon , flimsy and forlorn like a piece of crust . <p> When he finally left his bed , it was not yet day . Fog sheathed the grass and crouched in the higher country , lying in the private places , furring over the foothills and Big Horns . He thought himself a fool for the patch of disappointment he felt about Amber Harding being deprived of a proper view of things . He had hours to go before meeting the train at noon and could n't imagine the other time beyond that when he would have to occupy a stranger until six o'clock , the time of the party . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrubbing himself red and trying to make his hands look clean . He dressed in a white western shirt and Wrangler jeans . He bet this woman was expecting a man in a Stetson and pointed boots , but he wore his old oxblood Ropers and no hat . <p> He walked to the mailbox , knowing that an assortment of predictable cards awaited him , but there was only one card , a standard thing from his insurance man , reminding him of his age and the need to update life insurance options . <p> There were no other people at the train station , and he was glad for that . The day was still overcast , but it had warmed up , the sun moving in and out of rags of clouds , as if it could n't decide whether or not to make an appearance . The train was late , and there was no one at the ticket booth to give him any information . It surprised him to see some battered-looking luggage left for anyone to take . On the distempered walls were pictures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes and silver streams . He occupied himself looking at the posters and a map of the United States . He traced his finger from Northeast Wyoming to Iowa , trying to locate What Cheer , the red and blue road routes , train symbols , and rivers so tangled and dose he might be staring at a complicated wiring grid . He was still looking for What Cheer when he heard the train and saw , to his surprise , a teenaged boy rushing out of the men 's room , grabbing the luggage , and heading outside . Bill went outside and stood with the boy on the platform . " Train 's late , " the boy said , " but it 's here He looked at it incredulously and boarded , even though no railroad people appeared . <p> Bill could n't see anything in the train windows because the sun had emerged , casting plates of light on the smudged panes . He flirted with the idea of letting Amber Harding stay put , the fault of the busybodies who concocted the scheme , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was paying , feeling both enraged and paralyzed . It occurred to him that he was experiencing the worst part of the birthday joke , standing there like a lunatic , waiting for a fraudulent date . A hiss of steam from the locomotive startled him , and then the curious sight of a step stool dropping to the dust as if flung there . In time , a boot emerged , a pink western boot , small and unlikely-looking , like a shrimp in the desert . <p> She wore a salmon-colored dress , bell-shaped at the bottom , stiff and unyielding , as if filled with wire . Bill would not call this woman petite  --  short , perhaps . As he walked to her , she shaded her eyes , then reached back for a large blue suitcase and a plastic shopping bag . <p> " Miss Harding ? " he said . " Amber ? " <p> " That 's right , " she said . " Howdy . " She shook his hand vigorously . " Hotter than I expected here , but dry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . <p> " Whatcher , " she corrected . " Like what 's yer poison ! " She laughed loudly , and Bill smiled to be polite . <p> " Welcome to Wallace , " he said . <p> " We both come from places that begin with a W , " she remarked . <p> He said nothing as he lifted bags that seemed heavy as hay bales , and he felt silly when she asked him to pose for a picture outside the depot . " Wish there was someone around to take a shot of both of us , " she said . <p> He put her bags into the back of the pickup , hearing the train pull off with a shrill , mocking whistle . <p> " Did you have a good trip ? ' he asked her in the truck . <p> " Worst food in the United States , " she said , " and I did n't trust the water supply , either . Good thing I packed my own food to tide me over . Brought my own bottled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Your ad was accurate , too , " he lied , surprised to hear her laugh again , slapping her leg , her petticoats making a sound like wrapping paper . <p> He took the back roads home , avoiding the town entirely , uncertain of what was the greater cause for embarrassment  --  the sight of the town or of himself and this woman , frocked up in an outfit a mail-order catalogue might describe as old-fashioned country-western . <p> " It 's greener here than I expected , " she said . <p> " We had lots of snow , " he told her , " a good spring runoff . Around this time of year , you get late-afternoon thunderstorms . " He was certain he sounded like a hired tour guide , conveying a flatlander to a Wyoming dude ranch . " The party 's at six . You can rest up first . " <p> " Rest up ? " she said " This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . I want to see things . Later on , I 'll kick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her why she put an ad in the magazine and why she picked him , but she piped in by telling him she had never done anything like this before , going off to meet a perfect stranger , even placing an ad . " I 'm not a lonely woman , " she said . " I turned forty in January . I have studied two-step dancing and spend my spare time reading travel books <p> " What do you do in your other time ? " <p> " Well , Bill , " she said , " I practice self-improvement . What about you ? " <p> " I 'm a little short on spare time , " he said , " but I like movies and reading my trade journals , and tinkering with things , gadgets and the like . Sometimes I 'll take an appliance apart , for instance , dean it and reassemble it . " <p> She looked at him quizzically . " Do you go to rodeos , dances ? " <p> " Sure , and livestock shows and auctions <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet , " he said . " I can hardly keep track of the time . " <p> " I have n't seen a single ranch , " she remarked . <p> " We kind of keep to ourselves out here , " he said . " My father bought the land , and I 've been running things on my own ever since my folks died . My mother was an Easterner , not used to this kind of country . " He looked over and saw that she was asleep , her head plastered against the window , ruining a hairdo he suspected she got expressly for this trip , a kind of windswept thing , short on the sides , the wigs of the hair above fanning out severely . He brought his hand quietly up to her head , touching the brown hair and finding it softer than he expected . <p> He nudged her awake at the ranch , and she rubbed her eyes , casting them over the property and him with a look of disbelief . <p> " I was dreaming , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into dreams if you concentrate . Never worked for me , though . So , this is the spread . Does it have a name ? " <p> " No . I just call it home <p> She grinned . " You have got a sense of humor . " <p> As she looked at the house , the muscular hills flanking it , and the livestock shambling along , he wondered what she might be thinking . " Most everyone around here , " he said , " raises cattle or sheep . Not a lot of excitement , I guess you 'd say . " <p> " In my dream , " she said , " I climbed up a big tree , only it was inside , like a gymnasium , and you know what ? There was a polar bear at the bottom of the tree just waiting for me to let go <p> " Did you ? " he said . " Let go ! " <p> " I woke up . Wish I could go back to it <p> " Maybe you ought to rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've had a long trip . " <p> " But we have n't gotten acquainted , Bill . Would n't be right to go to your birthday shindig , hardly knowing a speck about you . That letter of yours piqued my curiosity . " <p> " What part ? " <p> " All of it . Here 's a sincere man , I said to myself , but guarded , like me . " <p> " You and me are alike , " he said , " in a partial way <p> " I 'm in the Big Horns , " she exclaimed , as she got out of the truck . <p> He gave her a short tour of the property , and as soon as he led her inside , she moved about the place deliberately , as if it were one she had known all her life . In the kitchen , she admired the gas range and ran her hand over the table . " I 'll bet you and your folks had some fine times at this table , " she said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place where his mother gazed out the window , and his father , a good man , but unable to fathom his wife and son , tried hard to bring them happiness , buying them presents all the time , TVs , household gadgets , and toys , saying after every offering , " Just the ticket , huh ? This 'll make a difference . " <p> He watched Amber removing food items from her plastic bag  --  oat cakes , cashews , raisins , apples , peaches , carrots . " I 'll fix us something light , a nice fruit salad . You 've got a big night ahead of you , " she said . <p> He had the odd sensation of being displaced and cosseted , as if he had stepped into another 's childhood . He felt sleepy . Curtains ghosted in and out the window near the sink where Amber stood , washing fruit , cutting it , the delicate taps sounding like a code . <p> " I 'll put your suitcase upstairs , " he said . <p> " Sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's heavy because I could n't decide what to bring and what to leave behind . " <p> As he lifted it , lumbering up the stairs , he figured the what-to-leave-behind part lost out . He placed it on the bed in the spare room and heard her humming downstairs . <p> He deliberated a few minutes , then opened her suitcase . She had packed as if guided by traveling how-tos : sweaters rolled neatly underneath folded blouses , shoes in plastic bags , along with cosmetics , dry-skin creams , and makeup said to contain no animal fats or petroleum products . In a dear plastic bag , he saw a red dress , a ruffled thing , its pleats reminding him of an accordion . He cringed at the thought of her showing up in that dress at the party . A white lacy nightgown was on top , still bearing the store tags and surrounded by lavender sachet packets . It had a plunging neckline . He looked up immediately , feeling a rush of shame . But he continued anyway , examining her things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dear Amber , <p> Sure liked your ad . I am about to turn fifty and would like it if we could hook up . I am a bachelor and have an ad in the very same magazine you 're featured in ( p. z3 ) . Do n't have a lot to say about myself , except I am average-looking , nothing to write home about . Those others in the magazine are certain of their likes and pet peeves . I am not . Generally , I take things as they come , but I have been known to wonder what 's around the corner . I run my own household . I can cook . I have cattle . It is pretty here . Would like to show it to you . It 'd be enough if you could just come for my birthday , as I do not have any close person . I promise no shocks . ( The birthday date is May 10 . ) <p> She was , he was certain , going to be on the lookout for signs of his desperation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was nothing to write home about , either . She was n't homely , but if he 'd had any selection in the matter , he would 've discouraged her from getting that hairdo . It made her face seem broad and looming , like one a person might see if he sat up too close to <p> movie screen . <p> When he went downstairs , he felt sheepish , half expecting her to know what he had been up to . She was sitting at the table , vials of vitamin pills near two place settings . <p> " I 've got a confession to make she said . " I poked around in your fridge and kitchen cabinets . You 're partial to nitrates . Hooh , the bacon and hamburger meat . I found Cheetos . " <p> " Amber , I 've got a confession , too . " <p> " No shocks , remember ? " <p> " I remember , " he said and looked over at her . She had almond-shaped green eyes . He had not noticed them before , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The table showed signs of her efforts : a bowl of fruit salad , water glasses with slices of lemon , and a loaf of bread , a large , miraculous-looking thing studded with nuts and raisins . " My ad and letter he said , " were n't entirely true . " <p> " Bill , " she said , " I guessed as much right off . You do not pay strict attention to diet , and you like things just the way they are . " <p> " I 'd call that a fair assessment , " he said . <p> She served him his food , and as she went at hers , he noticed she had a good appetite . <p> " I left out the occupation part in my ad , " she suddenly announced , " because I do n't have one , not at the moment anyhow . I was employed at the senior center as a cook . Of course , I could n't really exercise my skills because they had set menus , bulky stuff , packaged pudding mixes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is n't that a sad thing , Bill , scrimping on old folks ? Some of them are lucky to get one meal a day .

How long have you been out of work ! " <p> " Five months , " she said . " I 've been exploring options . I check out books from the library all the time about significant life changes . I was n't always on top of my nutrition . Seeing those senior citizens every day , well , it scared me . I 'm afraid of old age <p> " Shoot , " he said , " you 're only forty .

They had an hour before the party . <p> " Holy smokes ! " she exclaimed . " We leveled off this food , did n't we ? Must be the mountain air . We can work it off on the dance floor . " <p> He wanted to remain in the house with Amber Harding , as if the moment might come , as it had minutes ago when he felt expansive , hearing her talk about her life and fears , hearing himself say he was n't afraid of the same things as she . <p> " I 'm a little rusty , " he said .

" Guess we better change <p> Her petticoats made a noisy sound as she went up the stairs . He followed meekly , regretting going through her suitcase . <p> " What a pretty room , " she said . " I plan to get up bright and early tomorrow to watch you with the cattle .

He could hear no sounds upstairs and imagined that she had dozed off again , or , worse , had discovered his luggage excavation and was pouting . He would have a prepared story to tell her , he decided , and would divulge that the entire thing had been someone 's idea of a gag . He would give her some money for her troubles and see to it that she returned to Iowa in the morning . <p> " Close your eyes , " he heard her say at the landing . <p> Obediently and without hesitation , he did as she said , hearing his heart beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she came down the stairs . <p> She was upon him suddenly , smelling of lavender , her warm breath on his face .

She held a gift-wrapped package , which she offered to him , her hands cupped as if she might be presenting a drink of water . " Hold on , " she said . " I want a picture of you . Do n't you look nice <p> He smiled , his eyes startled by the flash . " You went all out , " he said . <p> " I got the dress in Cedar Rapids , " she said . " Go on , open your present .

" Seems different to me <p> " No , I took you home on a different road this afternoon . " <p> " And I ended up falling asleep . I missed the sights . " <p> " When I was a boy , " he said , " I went on a trip with my folks and saw a crop-dusting plane fall right out of the sky . I kept waiting for it to hit .

" I had something happen once he said and went on to tell her of the mountain lion incident , describing the rich smell of spring grass and the dampness he felt through his clothing as he lay on the ground . " A mountain lion sounds like a female in distress . This one had my number , all right , but she chose not to pounce on me . She was n't even skittish . She gawked at me , then fell right to sleep .

The hall was lit up , and the band was playing an unrecognizable tune , something that sounded like it needed a faster tempo . Bill got out of the truck and opened the door for Amber , but she seemed reluctant to step out . He assured her she 'd be looked after . Just as she had emerged from the train , her boot appeared first , and the sight of it suspended there moved him . He put his hands on her waist and lifted her from the cab . She seemed suddenly and surprisingly light . <p> " You 're crying , " he said , seeing her trying to conceal it . <p> " Tears of fulfillment , Bill . Let 's go . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crepe paper , and an enormous banner that said : " Happy Birthday , Bill . Just because the corral 's in sight do n't mean you ca n't enjoy the pasture . Watch out for cowpies , though Friends had signed the banner with good-luck wishes for many birthdays to come . When a cheer went up , Amber held his hand tightly . People approached , standing to look at him as if they could n't recognize him . Then they returned to the buffet table and the dance floor . He led Amber to the food , pointing out the Rocky Mountain oysters , and watching her trying some and seeming to enjoy them . She ladled potato salad on her plate and helped herself to chips and dip and hot dogs . People nodded when he introduced her to them , making little show of any surprise , as if they had known her a long time . <p> " You 've got lots of good friends , " she said when they finally sat down . " You 're lucky . " <p> " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> In a short time , the band stopped , and Ned Jencks stood in the center of the floor , making jokes . He was followed by others also making jokes about birthdays and Bill , like TV celebrity roasts . Bill laughed along , but knew he 'd never remember a single one of their lines . Ned Jencks called to him , and Bill reached for Amber 's hand , but she declined . " It 's your night , " she said . <p> He felt embarrassed standing there , and he dreaded the spectacle of a surprise announcement . A drum roll began , and people quieted down . " The grand finale , " Ned said . Bill looked over at Amber . She was sitting primly by herself at a long table . Then the lights dimmed . <p> Someone was making his way from the back door toward the center of the room , carrying a saddle . It was the sheepman , Bill realized , the one who had rescued him three years ago . The sheepman slowed at Amber 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't tell her people cooked up a scheme He closed his eyes and waited . <p> " For you , " the man said , startling him , coming suddenly upon him . He leaned towards Bill 's ear and whispered , " I did it , picked Miss Harding out special . This here saddle was someone else 's idea He placed the saddle at Bill 's feet . <p> Bill thanked him profusely and saw him retreat , walking uncertainly for a moment , until the lights came back on . <p> Instead of the " Happy Birthday " song , the band played a waltz . They were out of tune , and the selection they chose eluded Bill . People swarmed on the floor , their boots clacking loudly as if they were running instead of dancing . Without hesitation , Bill joined the fray , having no trouble at all finding Amber Harding for himself . <p>
