<p> As an Apollo 9 space walker in 1969 , Russell Schweickart spent 10 days in the heavens , but it was five minutes of " unemployment in space " that was to mold his life thereafter . <p> Schweickart was the first human to walk untethered out into the pitch-black unknown . For a filmed test , he was to drift weightlessly while clinging to a handrail between the spaceship and lunar module . But as technical history has proven in all matters of expediency , including Liz Taylor 's eighth wedding , the camera would n't work . <p> We 'll have it fixed in a jiffy , he was told , just hold that pose . <p> " I was literally to stay in the same place and not move , " recalls Schweickart , a 56- year-old father of five and Sausalito houseboat resident . His left hand gripped the bar while he let go with his right , allowing his body to swing around and face planet Earth for five full uninterrupted , contemplative minutes . <p> Then , in the most literal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schweickart . <p> " That was five minutes when I was just a human being . I was not a scientist or an astronaut , " says Schweickart . " That was the time I had to let the experience come in . " <p> When it did , Rusty Schweickart became the first true space cadet , long before fellow cosmic traveler Governor Jerry Brown saw a similarity and appointed him science and technology adviser , and later energy commissioner . <p> " This was truly a transitional moment in terms of life moving out of Earth , " he says . " I was there as a representative of humanity to bring that experience back to people . " <p> Which is what he has been trying to do ever since . <p> Schweickart is now white-haired and spends his days at a computer console in a downtown office . As president of NRS Communications , pretty much a one-man show , he and his second wife , Nancy Ramsey , are undertaking the rather lofty idea of connecting everyone on Earth via satellite communication . Not the dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock sports , but one in space where people could quickly and efficiently communicate ways to save the Earth . <p> " My life circulates planetary issues , " he says . " Everything I do is to keep the planet together . " <p> This can only be achieved when all the world 's citizens see the Earth as one , he says , the way he did in those long-gone five minutes . <p> " You have to be pretty damn thick to see the earth from space and not be deeply impacted , " he says . " There 's a different perspective among those who realize that all of life is one family . " <p> Schweickert was in the third group of astronauts chosen for the Apollo program . He was a trained fighter pilot with 1,000 hours of flight time , but he also had both a bachelor 's and a master 's degree from MIT . His master 's thesis was an experimental validation of theoretical models of stratospheric radiance . <p> Hard to picture your average fighter jocks wading through that one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scientific , " he says , which was more to his intellect than " the expedient baloney of us beating the Russians . " <p> Once he saw the Earth as one unit , he was prescient enough to realize how trivial the space race and even the Cold War truly were . So he got to thinking that most space explorers , both Soviet and American , which is all there were at the time , had to share his global viewpoint . <p> " One thing that seemed obvious to me was that there should be a way for astronauts and cosmonauts to come together , " he says . " Those who had seen the world as one place and not as international gladiators . " <p> The roots of his own organization , the Association of Space Explorers , was thus born . It was n't exactly Big Bill Haywood telling the International Workers of the World to rise up in arms . <p> " Unless we had our own organization , " he says , " we would always forever after be meeting at cocktail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DREAM <p> The idea festered for a decade and a half , as Schweickart went on to serve as backup commander for the first Skylab mission in spring 1973 . He left NASA in 1979 when Brown named him to the California Energy Commission . Schweickart 's term ended in 1985 and he moved to a Sausalito houseboat , to develop his dream in the proper setting . <p> " You go up and down and you rock back and forth , and it 's all part of the moon going around the Earth , " he says , sounding quite like his former boss . " You 're in contact with the solar system . " <p> Schweickart took an intensive Russian-language program so he would be cocktail party conversant , and the first congress of the Association of Space Explorers was convened in Sernay , France , with 25 delegates from 13 countries . <p> " The Home Planet " was the theme , and the slogan took hold . <p> In 1988 , Addison Wesley published " The Home Planet , " a coffee-table book that combines dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The book was a project to share our experiences in a very personal way , " says Schweickart , who wrote both the foreword and epilogue . <p> " There is no other book in existence that gives you a sense of the historic process of life evolving beyond the confines of earth , " he says , " and the love of the planet that evolves from this process . " <p> The book spent six weeks on the New York Times best-seller list , and half a million copies were sold , in 16 languages worldwide , including one presented to Mikhail Gorbachev on his 1988 visit to New York . This summer the book was issued in paperback . <p> It is an instructive tool , he maintains , not for the tired old reasons of glamour and adventure , but to see where we may all end up . <p> " Space is the future of humanity , " he says . " Without utilizing space as an observation platform , we have no hope for the preservation of life on Earth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lectures and symposiums . <p> Schweickart served as the first president of the association and sat on its board until his term expired last week . He and the organization are confident enough in the future of space travel to seriously address the issues of universal space rescue , and human performance in space . <p> " We 're involved in a process that is as important to the evolution of humanity as anything you can name , " he says . <p> BUILDING MOMENTUM <p> He expects this platform to be taken quite seriously when the association convenes its 1992 congress in the United States for the first time next summer in Washington , D.C. To build momentum , the group plans to release a second book , of essays by astronauts and cosmonauts . <p> The association now includes 197 members from 18 countries , almost 80 percent of the people who have flown in space . Admission standards are tight , even compared to the Pacific Union Club . <p> But it 's an association like any other , he says modestly . Some get drunk , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We sit around and tell war stories in a room , " he says . " The subject may be a little different and the group more exclusive , but we 're like any other organization . " <p> It 's symbolic the congress will be in the United States during International Space Year , as declared by the United Nations , to honor both the 30th anniversary of John Glenn 's orbit and the 500th of Christopher Columbus ' wayward vacation south of Florida . <p> Columbus was an astronaut in his own right , Schweickart says , and might even qualify for honorary membership in the association . <p> " It 's a natural expansion into space , just as there was a natural expansion of Europeans here 500 years ago , " he says . " What we 're really looking at here is an evolutionary process . That 's what the marriage of humanity and technology is all about . "
