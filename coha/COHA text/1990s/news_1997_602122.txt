<p> NEW YORK  --  If it were a golf match , not merely a writing contest , then John Updike would be emerging from the gallery of spectators for the final putt . <p> Updike , no stranger to golf metaphors , has the opening and closing shots in an on-line writing contest , ending Friday . <p> It began in July when Updike supplied a 300-word opening to a story he titled Murder Makes the Magazine , posted on line by Amazon.com , which sells books via the Internet ( http : //www.amazon.com ) . <p> Since then , Amazon.com 's staff has sifted through 1,000 entries a day , choosing daily $ 1,000 winners whose sentences are added to the story now filling 20 computer screens . To shift sports metaphors , it 's a kind of relay race writing . Not a style Updike recommends , except as a " larky thing to do . " <p> Today , he 'll get a printout of the penultimate installments of the story . By Friday , he 'll decide what finally happens to Miss Tasso Polk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 44 other writers who 've had their way with her and the plot . <p> " It 's kind of daunting , " he says , " but if I ca n't finish off Miss Tasso Polk , who can ? " <p> At 65 , with his 18th novel coming out next month , Updike is bemused by all the attention his on-line adventure has attracted , from the BBC World Service to the South China Morning Post . " This has gotten more ink , " he says , " than my last six books . " <p> He laughs , envisioning an " elderly white-haired writer gingerly stepping out into cyberspace , wherever that is . " <p> The winner of two Pulitzer Prizes ( in 1982 for Rabbit Is Rich and in 1991 for Rabbit at Rest ) , Updike displays his ambivalence toward technological progress in his dreamy and ironic new novel , Toward the End of Time , ( Knopf , $ 25 ) . He calls it " Updikian science fiction , " set in New England in 2020 after a nuclear " dust-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with China . <p> The national economy has collapsed . A ghost of the federal government is too weak to do much but send out forms . <p> When the 66-year-old narrator calls the police , he gets a " sugary automated voice " urging him to press 1 if an emergency , 2 to report evidence of a crime , 3 for traffic conditions and 4 for other matters . <p> He presses 2 and is instructed to press 1 if the crime was violent , 2 for a theft , 3 if it 's a white-collar crime and 4 for a public nuisance . <p> Beginning to sweat , he presses 1 , then 4 , and is told , " We 're sorry . At present all lines are occupied . " Then he 's treated to recorded easy listening , echoes of his youth , the Beatles without lyrics , now that the nominal government in Washington does n't favor " particular voice and themes , which might cohere into rebellion . " <p> Finally , he gives up : " The police were impregnable behind their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home outside Boston but no fax machine , no modem linking him to the Internet . " I 'm scared of another distraction in a life readily filled with too many distractions . " <p> He uses his computer for shorter pieces and book reviews but wrote the first draft of Toward the End of Time pencil on paper because that 's the way the narrator , a sex-addled retired investment counselor , would keep a journal . <p> He values how typewriters demand a physical exertion that " makes you earn the words . The difficulty of making corrections focuses your attention in a healthy way . " While in New York for some publishing business , he plans to use a typewriter today to write the final 200 to 300 words of the on-line mystery . <p> Still , computers make him more productive . " I 'm able to knock out neat copy much quicker , " but he adds , " I 'm not sure it 's any better . " <p> Updike has given new meaning to " prolific " since 1955 when , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Town pieces for The New Yorker . He was right out of Harvard and the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art in England . <p> A poet , essayist , book reviewer , art critic and short story writer , he has had a hand in 50 books . He has created worlds full of adulterers ( Couples ) and witches ( The Witches of Eastwick ) . He celebrated a mystical game ( Golf Dreams ) and penned the immortal line on Ted Williams , in his final at bat for the Boston Red Sox , hitting a home run , then refusing to emerge from the dugout despite the cheers of the crowd : " Gods do not answer letters . " <p> James Yerkes , professor of religion and philosophy at Moravian College in Bethlehem , Pa. , presides over a Web site devoted to " Updikiana , " ( http : //www.users.fast.net/ joyerkes ) that reviews his book reviews and debates questions such as how well Updike writes in a woman 's voice . <p> " I 'm flattered , " Updike says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to be crusty , but to me if it 's not in a book , I ca n't take it fully seriously . " <p> So what 's he doing as a kind of barker for an on-line writing contest ? The New York Times questioned " why Mr. Updike is involved in such an overtly commercial enterprise " and assumed " undoubtedly he is being paid a sizable advance . " <p> Updike says he got $ 5,000 , about what he 's paid for a New Yorker short story . His publisher urged him to do it " as a new way of marketing . " <p> He submitted three openings . He says Amazon.com chose the most melodramatic , " dredged from my files . " It 's the opening to a mystery novel begun 30 years ago and abandoned after 40 pages as being too flimsy . <p> In three tries , he has failed to master the mystery genre , despite youthful admiration for Agatha Christie and Ellery Queen . He blames an addiction to character development , symbols and themes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's like trying to run with big shoes on . " <p> He 's surprised that the on-line story , with a " few gaping inconsistencies , " is as coherent as it is about the disappearance of the founder of The Magazine ( as Updike calls it ) , Miss Polk 's life and work . Despite multiple authors , he says , " it 's hard to tell where one voice ends and the next one begins . " <p> Updike is no fan of collaborative writing . In 1958 , he left his first publisher , Harper and Brothers , for Knopf , after Harper demanded a new ending for his first novel , The Poorhouse Fair . But he notes the Bible is a chain narrative by a variety of authors , " each writing in his own voice and not always consistent . " <p> Updike continues to review books for The New Yorker , recently writing of Arundhati Roy 's The God of Small Things : " This is a first novel , and it 's a Tiger Woodsian debut  --  the author hits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short game . " <p> Updike did n't discover golf until he was 25 . " Golf was a rumored something , like champagne breakfasts and divorce , that the rich did . " Now , he sees it as a " momentary amplification of myself within a realm larger than life . " <p> Of late , he 's troubled by his long game . " I do n't feel weaker , but my drives do n't seem to be going as far as they used to . It 's like some kind of optical illusion , as if the fairways are longer . " And , as he writes : " We should be conscious of no more grass , the old Scots adage goes , than will cover our graves . " <p> His golfing and poker buddies are retiring and drifting to Florida . But , Updike says , " as a writer who 's never really been employed , it 's hard to retire . I ca n't imagine not sitting down every morning , trying to produce a couple of pages . " <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final volume in the life of Harry ( Rabbit ) Angstrom , Rabbit gasps , " Enough . " <p> Updike 's " golf game and I may be in a race to the grave , " but he vows to keep writing . " I 'd hate to think there 's a wintry masterpiece in me that did n't get out because I quit . I 'll work until senility sets in. "
