Darwin rarely used the conventional rhetorical device of depicting nature as a person ( invariably female in traditional usage ) . Darwin desisted for two good and personal reasons . First , his central theory of natural selection held that no direct causes worked at such comprehensive levels and that all general , and apparently purposive , patterns arose as a side consequence of struggle among individual organisms for reproductive success . Second , Darwin was not a lyrical writer , and he did not often resort to metaphors that might misstate the proper locus of causality . Thus , we may regard the final sentence of his book on the fertilization of orchids by insects ( written in 1862 as his first full work following . the Origin of Species ) as unusual and puzzling . Darwin wrote : " It is hardly an exaggeration to say that Nature tells us , in the most emphatic manner , that she abhors perpetual self-fertilization . " I believe that Darwin was driven to this rare verbal device by his awe at the intensity of the phenomenon  --  at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolved by flowers to assure that pollen does not always fertilize flowers on the same plant , but finds its way to the female organs of other plants , thus guaranteeing cross-fertilization . Darwin wrote : " In my examination of Orchids , hardly any fact has struck me so much as the endless diversities of structure  --  the prodigality of resources  --  for gaining the very same end , namely , the fertilization of one flower by pollen from another plant . " ( Darwin did not know the genetic reasons for the biological danger of such frequent self-fertilization or of sexual reproduction between very close relatives , but his culture certainly possessed sufficient folk wisdom about frequent hereditary deficiencies in offspring of such unions  --  and he correctly reasoned that natural selection must therefore strongly favor mating between nonrelatives . He also recognized that the evolution of devices to prevent self-fertilization would therefore operate as a good test for the power of natural selection , for if selection could not insure this most elementary of all biological imperatives , then his favored mechanism of evolutionary change had little power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modes evolved by plants to assure cross-fertilization , none is so common , so interesting , so provocative in inspiring endless books on the subject , and so fundamental in structuring our planetary ecosystems as the attraction of insects ( and sometimes other creatures , including hummingbirds ) to a flower , the development of devices to assure that pollen will be affixed to the visitor , and the evolution of other structures to promote the transfer of this pollen to female parts of other flowers visited later by the same insects . One might even say , to a first approximation , that the most striking characteristics of flowers  --  their sizes , shapes , and clustering ; the beauty of their colors ; the sweetness of their odors  --  exist largely as features evolved to attract animal pollinators . We once thought , in our arrogance , that God had so fashioned flowers for our delectation , but we are only the lucky beneficiaries of an eminently practical arrangement first evolved almost a hundred million years before our appearance on this planet . Going further , most evolutionary biologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assure cross-fertilization provides the most important reason for domination of the plant kingdom by the late-evolving group of angiosperms ( or flowering plants ) . Thomas Gray 's famous lines may be good poetry and fine metaphor , but they win no prizes for accuracy as natural history : Full many a flower is born to blush unseen And waste its sweetness on the desert air . Gray need not have lamented . That flower probably passed a most useful , if short , existence , attracting insects and securing its Darwinian fitness by having its pollen transferred ! If you have never contemplated the magnitude of this mutually beneficial linkage between insects and flowers ( food for the animals , fertilization for the plants ) , a few hours with Darwin 's 1862 book will provide great pleasure and reward . The full title reads : The Various Contrivances by Which Orchids Are Fertilized by Insects . The book is the botanical equivalent of a bestiary ( do we have such a word for the plant kingdom ? ) , cataloging the astonishingly complex devices evolved by orchids to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bounty onto another flower . Among the various traps , lures , and enticements , prurient humanity has found no solution more worthy of note than orchids with flowers so strikingly like the female genitalia of appropriate insects that visiting males attempt to copulate and get a dose of pollen for a reward . When such a pervasive system comes into place , on a worldwide basis in almost every environment , it becomes available for advantageous copying by evolutionary interlopers . In other words , if an insect can be induced to transfer a small , detachable part of an organism to another member of the same species , then such an organism might achieve great benefit if it could evolve to look like a flower and smell like a flower . This essay tells the story of a fungus that requires the mixing of two mating types at a vital stage in its life cycle , and that has achieved this end by mimicking a flower both in looks and odor , thus commandeering insects to effect the transfer . I promise to relate the story ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few paragraphs down the road , but first some comments on the general evolutionary phenomenon of look-alikes in a world with a predominant and opposite motif of diversification into a stunning variety of unique objects . The copycat theme finds its most evident expression in a phenomenon that evolutionary biologists call mimicry . Many animals gain protection by evolving to look like something innocuous or inedible : stick insects freeze their motion and look like dead twigs ; bitterns extend their necks , compress their thin bodies , and become indistinguishable from reeds in the marsh . In the classic textbook case , a tasty animal evolves an uncanny resemblance to an unpalatable relative that potential predators have learned to avoid . Have we not all seen the grand cliche of natural history filmmaking  --  a bird vomiting up poisonous monarch butterfly ? In this case the story of mimicry extends to etymology itself  --  for the tasty viceroy is a stand-in ( as in vice-president ) for the the king ( roi , or roy in older spellings ) , or monarch . Textbooks of evolution do not generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a wider principle known as convergence , or the separate evolution of striking similarity for functional reasons among creatures of very different ancestry . Convergence arises because functional solutions may be few , while many lineages often adapt to a similar role . Any vertebrate that flies will have to obey a stringent set of biomechanical requirements , and wings may be the only solution available within constraints of vertebrate design . Perhaps we should not be so surprised that birds , bats , and pterosaurs separately evolved wings of such striking aerodynamic similarity , based on such different anatomical underpinnings ( pterosaurs extend one finger to form the leading edge of the wing , birds attach feathers to the forearm , bats extend all fingers into the wing membrane ) . The conceptual similarity between mimicry and the more general phenomenon of convergence lies in their common theme of evolving such remarkable resemblance in independent lineages-the " copying " of one by another in mimicry ; separate development of forms close to an abstract mechanical optimum in convergence . We specially note such resemblances , and gather them together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strong similarity runs counter to the fundamental theme of evolution as a constantly diversifying process in a world so full of innumerable possibilities that nothing should ever happen twice . Any form of separately evolved similarity  --  by mimicry , convergence , or any other process  --  leads us to think that some pathways of life 's history may be predictable after all . Perhaps islands , maybe even continents , of determinism exist within the grand flow of contingency that drives the ever-spreading river of life through time . Perhaps the sciences of historical change might even aspire to the predictability of Galileo 's inclined plane or Foucault 's pendulum , leaving behind the messy images of pasts that need n't have been and futures that can not be known . Nothing like fungi to bring such reveries back to earth and concrete illustration . The fungi include mushrooms , bread molds , and a host of ubiquitous allies from the cause of athlete 's foot to the mycelium that may be swallowing Michigan ( see my column of July 1992 ) . Fungi used to be classified as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every multicellular organism to be either an animal or a plant . But fungi are now regarded as members of a separate kingdom of life , and the latest genetic evidence points to a closer relationship with animals than with true plants . Many fungi have complex life cycles featuring two mating types usually called plus and minus , for this system bears no evident homology with the distinction of male and female in animals . The mating types grow separate structures in one phase of the life cycle , but must then join to produce a different form in another phase of the cycle . In many fungi , the bisexual form is initiated by transfer of nuclei from a " donor , " or " male , " organ to receptors on an " acceptor , " or " female , " part . This system obviously resembles the transport of pollen between flowers in plants . Moreover , since fungi infect plants and may therefore live in proximity to flowers and their insect pollinators , the prerequisites for convergence are in place  --  structural similarity in the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and presence in the right place , where insects already benefit plants with such service . Any fungus that could mimic the floral parts or odors of plants could gain a great evolutionary boost . The natural history of fungi features several independent evolutions of devices to promote fertilization by insects . The rust fungi , for example , form a group with major impact upon human life , both as a result of their abundance ( some thousand species in North America ) and their attacks upon important crops ( the stem rust Puccinia graminis is an important parasite of wheat , rye , and other grasses ) . Most rusts form reddish or brownish patches of spores on their hosts . In 1927 , J. H. Craigie reported one of those serendipitous discoveries so beloved by scientists and so prevalent in our lore ( Nature , vol. 120 , p. 765 ) : On May 17 , Prof. A. H. Reginald Butler could you imagine a better name in all your Hollywood dreams ? , of the University of Manitoba , was in the greenhouse of the Dominion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitary fly , one of the first to appear after the winter season , had entered the greenhouse . Professor Butler directed my attention to the fact that the fly was settling on the sunflower leaves , sipping nectar at the pycnia of one pustule of the rust fungus Puccinia helianthia and then flying off to another leaf and sipping the nectar of the pycnia of another pustule , and he at once said : " The solution of the problem of the function of the pycnia is an entomological one . " ... This suggestion has been tested experimentally during the past summer and its excellence has been amply demonstrated . Craigie showed , in a series of clever experiments , that fungal spores of one mating type adhere to flies and then mix with spores of the other type , thus initiating the sexual phase of the life cycle , when the same fly visits another patch of fungus on a different leaf . He also demonstrated that the fungus patches actively encourage visits from the flies , by secreting a sugary nectar " sipped by the flies with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fungal pustules are " made conspicuous " by their yellow or red colors . Craigie concluded that the fungal patches " attract flies and reward them for their visits in very much the same way as do flowers . " These fungal patches do not mimic floral parts in any precise visual way ( although we should not impose our preferred mode of perception on other creatures ; the taste or odor mimicry of flower by fungus may well be highly developed ) . Other fungi add a layer of complexity by evolving a visual resemblance ; moreover , they often commandeer the plant 's growth patterns for their own purposes , rather than constructing the mimicry from fungal parts . In 1985 , for example , L. R. and S. W. T. Batra demonstrated how fungi in several species of Monilinia can spread among blueberries and huckleberries by using insects as vectors ( Science , vol. 228 , pp. 1011-13 ; Natural History , August 1987 ) . The fungus first attacks leaves , and the leaves subsequently attract insects in two ways . First , " an odor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fungal lesions ; insects " are attracted to these wilted leaves , where they lick the mantle of conidia the fungal structure and become contaminated with fungal spores . " Second , although " in daylight , the wilted leaves do not visually resemble the host 's white , yellow , and pink flowers , " many insects see in an ultraviolet range invisible to humans . Batra and Batra found that the ultraviolet reflectance of infected leaves , sharply contrasted with surrounding healthy leaves , seemed to attract insects ( and to elicit the flight patterns of flower feeding ) , and also resembled the " nectar guides , " or visual pathways ( often in the ultraviolet range ) , evolved by many flowers as insect enticers . Batra and Batra conclude that " the infected , discolored leaves evidently mimic the flowers of their host in yielding sugary rewards to the insects and , to some extent , in providing them with ultraviolet-reflective patterns analogous to nectar guides . " ( In this case , fungi do not " use " insects for fertilization , but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Insects carry the fungal spores from infected leaves to true flowers , and thence to other flowers . ) In another example of more overt floral parasitism , the anther-smut fungus Ustilago violacea sterilizes flowers of both sexes in its plant host , Silene alba ( male flowers do not produce pollen , while ovaries of female flowers abort early in development ) . The fungus induces the flowers ( both male and female ) to produce stamens without pollen , but filled with fungal spores . Insects then transmit the spores from plant to plant . Alexander and Maltby demonstrate that infected plants tend to produce many more ( if smaller ) flowers than healthy plants ( Oecologia , vol. 84 , pp. 249-53 ) . They conclude that " the fungus should benefit from the increased spore production . Additionally , the increased number of sporulating flowers may increase the chance of disease transmission through the attraction of more insect vectors . " But I write this essay because a more interesting , almost fiendishly complex case has just been elucidated by B. A. Roy and published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pp. 56-58 ) . In late summer , windborne spores of the rust fungus Puccinia monoica may infect herbaceous mustard plants of the genus Arabis . During the subsequent winter , the fungus invades the plant 's meristematic ( growing ) tissue and causes a pervasive infection that radically changes the growth and form of Arabis plants . Infected plants of Arabis holboellii , for example , may produce twice as many leaves , twice as many leaf rosettes , and grow twice as tall as nonflowering , uninfected plants . But the remarkable part of this story extends well beyond mere number to the color , shape , and odor of infected plants . A normal A. holboellii plant produces flowers by " bolting , " or producing a rapidly growing , elongated stem and then developing flowers at its end . The bolting stem either gives or receives a signal for flowering once it reaches a crucial height . The fungus has subverted this system for its own utility in a fascinating way . Infected plants do enter the bolting stage , but the central , elongating stem never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Thus , the bolted and infected plants are taller than healthy but unbolted specimens although shorter than fully flowering healthy plants . Perhaps the diversion of more energy to produce extra leaves and rosettes in infected plants prevents the bolting stem from reaching the crucial height needed to produce its own flowers . ) The bolted stem of infected plants then develops a dense cluster of leaves at its unflowered end . Bright yellow fungus covers the surface of these leaves and secretes a sticky , sugary fluid that insects seem to love . At such a density of leaves , with bright color and strong odor , the bolted ends of infected plants look for all the world like yellow flowers of many surrounding plants . As a most striking point about this particular mimicry , Roy notes that these fungal pseudoflowers do not resemble true flowers of their host plant , A. holboellii . Rather , they mimic the yellow flowers of other neighboring plant species , particularly buttercups of the genus Ranunculus . In other words , and strange as it sounds , fungal infection induces plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other , co-occurring species . The situation may sound bizarre , but from the standpoint of evolutionary advantage to the fungus , the species chosen for mimicry is immaterial so long as insects are attracted and do their work . ( As Mr. Steinbrenner once said about the economics of major sporting events , it 's all about " getting the fannies into the seats . " It does n't matter which fannies , so long as they come , behave adequately well , and pay the appointed price . ) Perhaps the fungus is yellow for other reasons , and buttercups become easier to copy than the host 's own flowers . Or perhaps yellow colors generally prevail in environments favored by Arabis , and insects might be drawn more easily to a yellow mimic . Roy suggests such an explanation in writing : " The color of pseudoflowers is indistinguishable in both the ultraviolet and visible spectra from that of yellow flowers of some co-occurring angiosperms and contrasts sharply with green vegetation . Yellow is a particularly common color for flowers of plants that , like Arabis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In any case , the ruse works , and insects flock to the fungal pseudoflowers ( and why not ; the insects are not fooled in terms of their own requirements , for they get nourishment whether the source be fungal or plant nectar ) . In fact , Roy shows that insects generally favor the fungal pseudoflowers to surrounding true flowers , both in initial selection and in time subsequently spent . She found , for example , that flies visiting both fungal pseudoflowers and true flowers of the genus Pulsatilla spent five times longer , on average , at the fungal forgeries . In mixed plots , including fungal pseudoflowers , buttercups , and true flowers of several other species , " insect visitors also spent 88 percent of their time on pseudoflowers . " Roy supposes that " pseudoflowers may detain pollinators for relatively long visits because ... sugar is spread over the whole surface of the pseudoflower , rather than being concentrated in a nectary . " The ruse also works in another striking way  --  by fooling every other relevant biological agent as well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pollinators lie in wait within the pseudoflowers ( although , again , one may say that the predators are not fooled , but just properly hanging out wherever their prey may come ) . Roy writes : " Crab spiders and other predators of pollinators were also observed waiting for prey inside pseudoflowers , just as they do in flowers . " Most intriguingly , as the only agent to whom explicit notions of trickery may be legitimately ascribed , humans fall for the deceptions just as readily . Roy notes : " The floral mimicry fools humans as well as insects : botany students at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory have frequently collected pseudoflowers thinking they were flowers and , at a distance , many professional botanists have mistaken them for true flowers . " In summary , the unusual character of this mimicry resides in two stunning features : first , the production of resemblance , not so much by the beneficiary itself but by the fungus 's ability to commandeer and alter the growth patterns of its plant host ; second , the mimicry by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implicating an entire flora in the pattern . Roy summarizes her conclusions : " Puccinia monoica does not exploit its host 's flowers ; instead , it causes its host to construct a completely counterfeit flower , one that mimics flowers of co-blooming species such as buttercups , rather than mimicking the host itself .... Thus , this plant disease affects not only its hosts , but an entire natural community as well . " Stories of such precise resemblance , evolved by organisms so divergent that we classify them in different kingdoms , must inspire hopes for a natural world less capricious ( and more predictable ) than our fears or our resignations often lead us to suspect . After all , if a fungus can so precisely mimic a flower , then certain natural forms must stand as limited and anticipated optima  --  to be evolved again and again by organisms in similar ecological circumstances or pressures of natural selection . Since the image of such a sensible and predictable history , with humans ruling the roost by natural right , ranks so high among the psychological hopes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for clutching at any natural tale that might be read as evidence for such a scenario  --  hence , our fascination for mimicry , convergence , and all the other evolutionary phenomena that produce adaptive similarities rather than continual uniqueness and variety . I do not , of course , deny that the history of life includes predictable events and recurrent patterns . I do , however , suspect that most predictable aspects of life lie at too " high " a level of generality to validate what really stirs and troubles our souls  --  the hope that we might ratify as a necessary event the evolutionary origin of a little twig called Homo sapiens . That is , I am perfectly willing to grant the repeatability of such morphological principles as bilateral symmetry in mobile , multicellular organisms , or such ecological rules as " more biomass in prey than in their predators . " But similar predictability does not extend to any particular event of a unique and contingent evolutionary pathway  --  and I 'm afraid that the evolution of Homo sapiens counts as a singular event , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while validating a purely local predictability within a complex set of boundary conditions , can not give us what we really want  --  predictability from first principles for details at the level of our own origin . The impediment to our hopes lies in the contingency of the boundary conditions themselves . Sure , give me a system already in place , where plants achieve fertilization by conning insects into transporting pollen as they feed , and I will predict that any other creature with pollen-sized parts needing a boost from place to place might do well to mimic a flower and cash in upon a going concern . But if I could rerun the tape of life from the origin of unicellular organisms , what odds would you give me on the reevolution of this complex and contingent insect-flower system  --  the prerequisite in boundary conditions for our story of fungal mimicry ? Would we see anything like either insects or flowers in the rerun ? Would terrestrial life originate at all ? Would we get mobile creatures that we could call animals ? Would we even get macroscopic or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already 99 percent of the way toward a particular result  --  and the establishment of this 99 percent lies firmly in the domain of unrepeatable contingency . Give me Homo erectus and I will predict the evolution of artistic expression in some form . But give me a Cambrian trilobite as the most complex living animal and I dare not even anticipate the evolution of any vertebrate . Historian Michael Shermer has well summarized the interaction of randomness and predictability in history in an article in Nonlinear Science Today ( vol. 2 , no. 4 , 1993 , pp. 1-13 ) : " The Chaos of History : On a Chaotic Model That Represents the Role of Contingency and Necessity in Historical Sequences . " He constructs and illustrates , using the fashionable concepts and terms of chaos theory , a model that he calls " contingent-necessity , " or " a conjuncture of events compelling a certain course of action by constraining prior conditions . " ( Shermer uses the Battle of Antietam as his main illustration , as I and others have used Gettysburg for similar purposes . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil War  --  and our understanding that the whole bloody affair need not have happened , and would never have occurred in the same way again , yet careered down an unstoppable path once a certain weight of circumstances had accumulated . ) Shermer emphasizes the unrepeatable oddities that must be strangely strung together to set the complex context and boundary conditions of any historical sequence . ( At this stage , the lack of a horseshoe nail can threaten the kingdom . ) But later stages of the sequence may then unroll with unstoppable predictability . ( The horse went lame , the messenger never arrived , the army was destroyed , and nothing can save the kingdom now . A jester arrives on the field of war holding a horseshoe nail  --  and no more ridiculous example of " too little , too late " could ever be given . ) Shermer summarizes the shift from pervasive early contingency to strictly local ( and late ) necessity : " In the development of any historical sequence the role of contingencies in the construction of necessities is accentuated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pseudoflowers are late necessities , and they give us no reason to suppose that the complex contingent prerequisite for this sensible story  --  the evolution of the insect-flower system  --  has any similar predictability . ( As an interesting consequence of Shermer 's model , we may ask why life as a whole does n't finally settle down to globally predictable unrolling , whatever the massive contingency of initial stages . Shermer points , correctly I think , to the importance of infrequent and highly disturbing events such as mass extinction for faunas or punctuated equilibria for lineages in derailing the stasis or predictable unrolling of systems otherwise stabilized . The theoretical importance of rare , and sometimes cataclysmic , events  --  as the preservers and reinvigorators of global contingency  --  may best be appreciated in the light of such historical models . ) Darwin was also interested in the complex interaction of randomness and predictability , although I think that he emphasized repeatability unduly in this seminal passage on the eventual reestablishment of plant communities in cleared fields ( in this case , on former Indian mounds ) : When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank , we are tempted to attribute their proportional numbers and kinds to what we call chance . But how false a view is this ! Everyone has heard that when an American forest is cut down , a very different vegetation springs up ; but it has been observed that the trees now growing on the ancient Indian mounds in the Southern United States display the same beautiful diversity and proportion of kinds as in the surrounding virgin forests .... Throw up a handful of feathers , and all must fall to the ground according to definite laws ; but how simple is this problem compared to the action and reaction of the innumerable plants and animals which have determined , in the course of centuries , the proportional numbers and kinds of trees now growing on the old Indian ruins ! I certainly share Darwin 's awe at the reestablishment of the " same beautiful diversity " with the same " proportion of kinds " in the reconstituted forest . This repetition indicates some predictability and some lawlike structuring in the forest ecosystem . But we may not draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's particular pathways . Climax forests are in the stable phase , the last predictable part , of one of Shermer 's sequences . We can anticipate what will eventually grow on the Indian mounds , for this system already exists in the neighboring forest  --  just as fungal pseudoflowers make predictable sense because they have horned-in upon the long and well-constructed system of insect-flower interactions . But a replay of life 's tape would probably not yield a forest ecosystem at all  --  perhaps neither an ecosystem nor a forest nor life in any familiar form . The replay might provide no trees and almost certainly no Indian mounds to form a cleared space for a regrown forest . No mounds , no communities , no people , no interactions , no hi-ho Silver , no William Tell overture , no apples or arrows , no Rossini , no Toscanini , no you and no me .
