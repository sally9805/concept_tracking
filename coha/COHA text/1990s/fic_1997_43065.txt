BECAUSE DARRYL , at thirteen , was too young to work , his stepfather , Jack Mitchell , found him odd jobs when he could . That way Darryl would have his own pocket money , Jack Mitchell would explain ; it would teach him responsibility . One Wednesday in June , Jack Mitchell found work for Darryl and his friend Two pulling weeds outside the new post office . <p> Jack Mitchell and the postmaster , Wiley Edwards , both held seats on the Fitzgerald Town Council , and as fellow councilmen , they did each other favors . For Jack Mitchell , such amiability was a political move . For Darryl and Two , though , his political jockeying meant twenty dollars , quick cash in their pockets . <p> The new post office had been built on a dry , dusty lot on Mesquite Street , just down the road from the county courthouse in downtown Fitzgerald , Texas . Darryl and Two were to pull up the weeds and shrubs to prepare the ground for sodding . It was mindless work , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the rock-hard soil . Whether the boys did the job in four hours or six or ten , the work was worth twenty dollars each . After an hour and a half , they had finished more than half the lot . <p> The boys had taken their T-shirts off , and the sun scorched their already bronzed skins . Walking bent at the waist strained their lower backs , and the mindlessness of the work wore on their minds . So they started singing . <p> " You know Chuck Berry ? " Two asked . <p> " Yeah , I know Chuck Berry . " <p> " My daddy 's got a lot of Chuck Berry albums . " Two straightened , stretching out his long back , then bent back to work . " He 's got this song , School Days . ' You know it ? " <p> " How does it go ? " <p> Two 's head danced on his neck to the rhythm on the inside . He sang : " Up in the morning and off to schoo-ool .. " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " His head started its own dance , like a camel 's in stride , to the beat beating inside . <p> Two sang as they pulled : " Teacher be teaching the Golden Ru-ule . " <p> Then Darryl : " Bell rings , time to go home , / Grab some white boy 's change and get ' long on . " <p> They erupted with laughter as they clapped garden-gloved hands , steadily moving down the row . <p> Two continued : " Boy hollers , crying in his pla-ate . . . / Slap ' im upside his head and do n't be la-ate . " <p> Then Darryl : " Cops , coming , so fast , / They gon na get your black assl " <p> But Darryl 's palm-slapping laughter stopped when he did n't hear Two slap-laughing beside him . He glanced over and saw Two staring straight ahead , and then he saw what Two was staring at : a silver-suited pink balloon-Wiley Edwards-sucking a cigar and looming over them . <p> Wiley Edwards , his red face puckered around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . His belly surged over his belt and hung there , almost a separate , threatening entity . Darryl and Two straightened , a clump of pulled weeds in each hand . <p> " Yes , sir ? " Darryl asked . <p> " You boys can go on home , " Mr. Edwards said . " Sir ? " <p> Mr. Edwards pulled a wallet from his inner jacket pocket . " We did n't hire you boys to sing , " he said . " We hired you to clear this lot . " He gave each a ten-dollar bill . " Now , if y'all want to come out here and be disrespectful and play , well , y'all can just go on home . " He turned . " You explain to Erskine why I sent you home . " Then he waddled around the building and inside . <p> Darryl looked at the half-cleared lot , then at Two . " What was that about ? " he asked . <p> " I do n't know , " Two said , " but I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's about . That 's about seven dollars an hour . " <p> " Jack Mitchell 's going to kill me . " <p> " ' Cause we got the ax ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " Ca n't do nothing about it , " said Two . " We was working and white man told us to go on home . " " Still . . . " <p> " Ca n't do nothing about it , " said Two . <p> Darryl put the bill in his pocket and followed Two onto Mesquite Street . They walked toward the Flats , where Two lived and where Jack Mitchell worked and would be waiting to drive Darryl home to Oakbrook Heights . <p> Two turned . " Hey , who 's Erskine ? " <p> They passed the Dairy Queen and crossed the street toward the bowling alley . " My stepdad , " Darryl said . " Jack Mitchell . " " Erskine Jack Mitchell ? " Two asked . <p> " Erskine Elie Mitchell , " said Darryl . " They just call him Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Er-shine , Ee-lie . " Then he added , " Y'all northern niggahs sure is some poetic folks . " <p> " Must be a black thing then , " said Darryl , " Bernard Ferdinando Lamar Waymans the second . What , could n't your folks decide on a name ? " " Yeah , " he said . " Two . " <p> Two crossed the parking lot toward the Nite-Owl Lanes . " Let 's go in here and spend some of this hard-earned cash . " <p> " All right , " said Darryl , but he was still preoccupied with how to explain getting fired to Erskine Elie Mitchell . <p> After getting change , they pumped quarters into video games . They played each other in a football game with such fury that their palms blistered . " You see that pass ! " Darryl said . <p> " I saw it . " Two 's team regrouped in a huddle on the screen while he selected one of the four defensive options . But his best option , it seemed , was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what 's your middle name ? " <p> " I told you ten thousand times already , " said Darryl , never looking up . " I do n't have one . " <p> " And I did n't believe you then neither . " " Well , it 's true , " he said . " I do n't . " <p> " You a lie . " <p> " I do n't . " <p> " You know you a lie . " <p> Darryl said , " What d' you want my middle name to be ? " Two stopped playing and looked across at Darryl . " Pharmaceuticals . " <p> " All right . I 'm Darryl Pharmaceuticals Young . " <p> " Poetic , " said Two . <p> " Just a black thing .... Touchdown ! D' you see that play ? " <p> " Aw , man , " Two said , " I was n't even watching ! " <p> " Well , quit squawking and play then .... " <p> " You cheating Pharmaceuticals chump . " <p> " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your ball . " <p> In no time they 'd whittled their ten-dollar bills down to one fifty ( one seventy-five for Two ) , and they continued toward the Flats . As they walked along sidewalks like hot plates , the soles of their sneakers squooshing like sponges with each step , Darryl rehashed the morning in his head : they got to the post office on time , worked like beasts in that dusty heat , but still got fired . For laughing . They did n't do anything bad ; if you can laugh while you work it makes the work go by better , that 's all . Jack Mitchell would understand that . Of course , Darryl would leave out the part about the swear word . <p> " Two , man , " he said , " we got fired for laughing . " <p> " My daddy says white man do n't like to see black folks laughing . Thinks they 're laughing at him . " <p> " Jack Mitchell 'll understand that . " <p> " Maybe so , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make him understand your magic trick that made a ten-dollar bill turn into one seventy-five in change . " <p> " Yeah . " Darryl had n't even considered that . And he only had one fifty left . <p> They walked on , searching silently for a solution . A Fightin ' Pioneers poster taped in a shop window brought them to a halt . It announced the upcoming high-school football season , and on it was a picture of the quarterback , Hoodie Duncan , his arm cocked to throw a pass . <p> " Hoodie 's my man , " Darryl said , <p> " Hoodie 's my main man , " said Two . " Look-it the arms on him . " Two sat down suddenly on the curb and scrambled in his pockets . " Hang on a minute . " He pulled out a fistful of rubber bands . <p> " What you got rubber bands for ? " Darryl asked . <p> " I been wearing them , " said Two . " Make me look strong . " <p> " Huh ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's how folks can tell you 're strong , " he said , double-wrapping two around each wrist , then pumping his hands to inflate his forearms . <p> Darryl looked and mimicked Two 's actions . " How 's that ? " he said . " The veins be sticking out your forearms , " Two said , inspecting his , then pumping his hands again . " That 's how they know . " <p> " Really ? " <p> " Yeah . You look at Hoodie , or any of them tough brothers . They veins be winding like snakes all down they arms . " <p> " That 's true . " Darryl remembered seeing Hoodie at the 7-11 once . Hoodie joked with the black attendant , signifying with his hands and holding his green-and-gold letter jacket in his fist , and the veins of his arms seemed to jump off his skin . Darryl had been with his mom , who did n't see Hoodie or the attendant or even Darryl , it seemed ; their playfulness stopped , though , when Darryl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the store as she busily searched one aisle then the next for the saltines she 'd forgotten to buy at the A &P.; <p> Darryl and Two resumed their walk , hands periodically pumping the air . Two said , " My daddy was a boxer and . . " <p> " Really ? " <p> " Yeah . In the army . A welterweight , " Two explained . " So he could whoop upside some white boys ' heads . He told me he used to beat on white boys ' ass like there was n't no tomorrow . Said it was the only way you could get at ' em in them days , with gloves on , in the ring . Otherwise , have the law and all kinds of white folks all after you . " <p> " Yeah , they say it was like that . " That Two 's father , now just a mechanic for the town of Fitzgerald , had once been a recognized athlete put him in very high esteem in Darryl 's eyes . He wished Jack Mitchell had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulbous Jack Mitchell in a letter jacket . <p> Jack Mitchell was the town 's first and only black councilman . That meant something . When he married Darryl 's mom and moved the family to Fitzgerald , they made up the town 's first interracial couple , ever , and the only one still . Theirs was the only black family to live in Oakbrook Heights . But still , it was n't the same thing . <p> Two said , " My daddy , when he was boxing , he said he 'd walk around squeezing tennis balls . It helped his punch . He 's still got all kinds of veins sticking out his arms . " <p> " He 's strong , huh ? " <p> Two stopped and , face askew , stared Darryl down until Darryl stopped walking , too . " Let that niggah get a switch after your ass and ask me that again . " Then he sauntered forward . <p> They cut through the Texaco onto Third Street . Walking between the pumps , Two stepped deliberately onto the slim rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clanged , but nobody stirred , so they continued walking . <p> Darryl said , " Your dad was a boxer . " <p> " Yeah , " said Two . " He was good . " <p> When they arrived at the vacant lot that separated the back of Eastgate Mall from the Flats , Two inspected his forearms , then backpedaled away from Darryl into the shimmering , sun-scorched reeds , his arm cocked to throw a pass . " I 'm Hoodie Duncan , " he called , bouncing on the balls of his feet as if in the pocket . " You see him in that game against Dumas ? " <p> " I saw the game with you , Two . " <p> " Man , I ai n't never seen nothing like that . " Two scrambled left . " Hoodie rolled left , and when the dude grabbed his right arm , he shook him " - which Two did , mostly just jiggling his shoulder- " put the ball in his left hand , and fired it downfield . " Two mimed the motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Hell yeah , he 's toughl You know he 's tough . Just six niggahs on the whole damn team ? Shit , you know they ai n't about to let n'an one of ' em play quarterback unless he 's two times as tough as every white boy on the field . " Two caught up to Darryl . " And Hoodie is . Being ambidextrous and all . " " Ambi-what ? " <p> " Ambidextrous , " said Two . " Hoodie 's ambidextrous . My daddy 's ambidextrous , too . It means you can use your left hand just as good as your right . Do whatever you want with either one . " <p> Macadam turned to dirt in the Flats . Darryl and Two walked down the dusty road toward the Three Jacks ' Bar , where Jack Mitchell ( the third Jack ) would be waiting . Darryl figured that Jack Mitchell had probably already talked to Wiley Edwards , so he was in no rush to get there . Dragging along , Darryl mimed a throwing motion with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . <p> Two , watching Darryl , cast his own left arm forward . " I 'm ambidextrous , too , " he said . <p> " Sure you are . " <p> " You know I am . " <p> " Right . " <p> " What you boys know ? " they heard , and turned toward the porch from where the sound was emitted . <p> It was Grandpa Thevenet . Two started onto the porch of the peagreen house , and Darryl followed . <p> " Hey , Grandpa Thevenet , " Two said . <p> " Hey , " said Darryl . <p> Grandpa Thevenet , who was nobody 's grandfather that either boy knew , was magical . " Hey youself , " he said to them . <p> Grandpa Thevenet had a piano-key smile and told stories that would light up a place , wherever he happened to be . When Grandpa spoke , he sounded like the French Canadians Darryl had seen in droves when Jack Mitchell took the family to Disney World , but Grandpa Thevenet was from Louisiana . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long like Sunday , rested an accordion . Grandpa could do with his accordion what Hoodie Duncan did with a football . " You boys tell me what you tink of dis song . " <p> Some people called it zydeco . Grandpa Thevenet called it housedance music . The best music there is . Grandpa said he 'd learned it as a boy in the bayous in the ' 20s . He said his papa would play it on the violin on Saturday nights for the family and the neighbors . Folks swaydancing and laughing ; the swamps would be charged on Saturday nights . Grandpa had taken to the accordion and joined his papa in the musicmaking when he was only eleven ( " I was n't not'ing but a son den " ) and could hardly handle the accordion 's bulk between his spindly arms . When his papa followed the oil boom from the swamps of Louisiana to the plains of West Texas , they brought the music along . For awhile , Beezville ( which was what Grandpa still called the Flats ) had been plugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Saturday nights . But he mostly played for himself now . And very infrequently . Two and Darryl , sitting Indian-style on the porch , clapped with the beat . Grandpa smiled and swayed his head with the pumping accordion . The smile seemed to be as much a part of his music as the instrument . It replaced the lyrics , which were few , and let the listeners know that no matter what the words said , the people were together to have a good time . <p> " Ma Claire est belle , " Grandpa sang : <p> Say , ma Claire , elle est belle . <p> Mais les haricots n'sont pas sales <p> Faut que je la renvoye chez elle . <p> He threw back his head , loose sunshine-yellow shirt rustling with his laughter . " Now , what you tink a dis song ? " Grandpa asked , carefully laying the accordion beside his chair . <p> " Tops , " said Two . <p> " It was great , " said Darryl . <p> " Ah , you like it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . <p> " Tey means : ma girl Claire , she a beauty . But she no know how to make my beans , so 's I have to send her home . " <p> The boys laughed . <p> " Naw , " Grandpa laughed with them . " High-yalla gals just cai n't cook , " he said , himself a shade only slightly darker than his shirt ; and he laughed some more . But then he stopped . " What 's tat you got on your wrists ? " <p> " Rubber bands , " Two said , almost in a whisper and no longer looking at Grandpa . <p> " Rubber bands ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " Boys , you take tose off now . " He was no longer smiling . " You crazy ? Cut off te circulation to your hands . " Grandpa Thevenet raised his own to accentuate his point . His hands were beautiful : delicate but strong . They looked sculpted . <p> When Darryl unwound the bands , he noticed the bulge of veins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like Hoodie Duncan . <p> He handed the rubber bands to Two , who was rising . <p> " We got to go , Grandpa Thevenet , " Two said . <p> " Yeah . " Darryl rose , too . <p> Two said , " Thanks for playing that music for us . " <p> Grandpa Thevenet smiled again . Wide . " You boys don ' be so scarce no more . Come by and see me some . " <p> " OK , " Two said . <p> " We will , " said Darryl . <p> And they climbed down off the porch and into the dirt street . The twins , Fredrick and Dedrick Horton , were walking in the other direction . Two scrawny boys who together might make one normal-sized teenager , they often acted as though , because they were one grade higher in school , they were superior to Darryl and Two . As they approached , Darryl noticed one or the other-Fredrick or Dedrick , he could never tell them apart-snickering and looking toward Two and him . <p> Two raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dedrick . " Y'all see something funny ? " <p> " Yeah , " said Fredrick ( or maybe it was Dedrick ) , " you two knotheaded nigros up there samboing like slave days with Grandpa Sambo hisself . " The other 's laugh ( Dedrick 's ; or maybe it was Fredrick 's ) was equally derisive . <p> " If you see a knot-head nigro , " Two said , " give him ten dollars . " Two waited . " Uh-huh , that 's just what I thought . " <p> " If I had ten dollars , you the last niggah see the green on its back . " <p> " You do n't wan na be messing with me today , Fredrick . " <p> " I 'm Dedrick . " <p> " Do n't care who you is , " said Two . " You two big-lipped baboons look so much alike , it 's like I 'm talking to just one of you niggahs anyway . Just do n't be messing with the kid . Not today . " <p> " The kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking his head no and raising his hands as if in disbelief . " Do n't be missing with the kid . Or I 'm a have to open me up a can of whoop-ass on you . " <p> " Whoop-ass on who ? " <p> Two looked around . " I do n't see nobody else in this road . " Dedrick , leering , squared up on Two . " Well , kid , go ahead . Do it then .... " <p> Darryl felt Grandpa Thevenet 's stare on them and felt suddenly small . He pulled back Two , who was now face-to-face with and mimicking Dedrick . " C'm on , Two . I 've got to go . Jack Mitchell 's waiting for me . " <p> Dedrick turned on Darryl . " Well , go on and run after that tomming niggah then . Was n't nobody talking to you . Oreo . " <p> Darryl felt himself tighten , terror and rage racing through his body so strongly it turned his stomach . His legs felt weak . But he just stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Two stepped between Darryl and the twins , speaking excitedly . " Man , if I was you , Fredrick . . . " <p> " I 'm Dedrick . . . " <p> " Do n't care who you is , I 'd quit that squawking and I 'd be walking if I was you . My man Darryl wind up doing you just like I saw him do yo ' momma the other day . " <p> Dedrick surged at Two- " Do n't be talking about my momma , niggahl " - but Fredrick reined his brother 's charge . " Chill , Ded , " said <p> Fredrick . " Chill . " <p> Grandpa Thevenet called from his pea-green porch , " Y'all boys cut t'at mess out ' fore I comes down t'ere and whups all ya 's skinny tails myself . " <p> Two , pulling Darryl by the shirt , shuffled backward , like an Ali dance step , wearing a victorious smile . Darryl still felt his throat choked up , his legs shaky ; but Two , speaking with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punch : " Yo , Dedrick . Yo , man .. " When Dedrick finally calmed enough-leaning against his brother 's restraining arm-to listen , Two sang : " I saw yo ' momma at Burger King ; / Hit that bitch with a chicken wing ! " <p> Dedrick swung wildly , but Darryl and Two were already laughshuffling up the road . <p> " Chill , Ded . " Fredrick struggled to restrain his teary-eyed and flailing-armed twin . " Chill ! " <p> " Yo , Fredrick , " Darryl called over his shoulder . " She 's your momma , too . " <p> And Darryl and Two , hoofing it up the road , burst out laughing . <p> Their smiles died when they arrived at the gravel intersection where they would part . Two lived a few houses down the side street . The Three Jacks ' , cast in the shadows of trees , loomed quietly just a hundred yards up the road . <p> Looking toward the bar , Darryl said , " Jack Mitchell 's going to kill me . " Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving his stepson to and from the Flats , he hardly even spoke . But this was different . <p> " Maybe they wo n't know , " said Two , looking toward his house . " I 'm a tell my daddy we got fired and white man did n't give us nothing . " <p> But Jack Mitchell would know . He 'd know how much they got , when they started and when they stopped , and he 'd know what Darryl had said in the song . Jack Mitchell and Wiley Edwards and the other councilmen were buddies . In fact , had it been anybody but one of them , Jack Mitchell probably would n't say anything . <p> Two patted Darryl on the shoulder , moving past , and he smiled . " Oh well , " he said , " ca n't die but once , and never be deader than that . " <p> Darryl stood , looking down the road at the Three Jacks ' . He could hear Two 's quarters jingling in his pocket as he jogged toward his house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He steeled himself , his step steady and resolved , because he had n't done anything wrong . <p> Pool balls ' clacking clatter burst over the dusk of the Three Jacks ' Bar and Lounge as Darryl entered . After his eyes adjusted to the lack of light , Darryl noticed the other two Jacks , Jack Pickering and Jack Johnston , playing cards at the bar . When he saw Darryl , Jack Pickering pointed over his shoulder . " Your daddy 's waiting for you out back . " <p> Marching through , Darryl thought : Jack Mitchell is not my daddy . Darryl called him Dad when addressing him directly , but otherwise he was always and only Jack Mitchell . A nice enough man ; his mom 's husband , his little sister 's father ; but not his own daddy . And it was n't spite that made him feel this way . It was just the truth . So if Jack Mitchell was waiting out back to scold him , well , it disturbed Darryl ; because Jack Mitchell was his elder , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't haunt him , because it could involve no fall from grace . Jack Mitchell was not his daddy . Not like Mr. Waymans , the boxer , was to Two . <p> Jack Mitchell sat heavily in a too-small chair at the desk in the back office . He looked up when Darryl entered , stared , but said nothing . <p> Darryl stayed where he was , near the door . " Hey , " he offered as greeting . <p> " What happened at the post office ? " <p> " At the post office ? " Darryl asked . <p> " You heard me fine . " <p> Darryl shifted his weight . " Mr. Edwards sent us home , " he said . <p> " Sent you home ? " Jack Mitchell 's eyes were working to meet Darryl 's . <p> " Yes , " Darryl said , looking from Jack Mitchell to his feet . <p> " Boy , you know better than playing around ! . . . " <p> " We were n't playing around , " Darryl said , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heard us singing and told us to go home . " <p> Jack Mitchell stopped . " Were n't playing around , " he said . " But he told you to go home . " <p> " Yes , " Darryl said , eyes slipping down to his feet again . <p> " He told you to go home for a reason , I suppose ? " <p> " For laughing , but we worked hard .... " <p> " Boy , you know better than playing around ! Laughing ! White man sees you playing around and laughing , he thinks you 're not working . He thinks you 're clowning . Just another lazy niggah wanting a handout " Jack Mitchell never used the word nigger ; he said it was beneath him " and now here you go , clowning and playing the fool and acting like a niggah . Is that what you want ? " Jack Mitchell asked , and he stared at <p> Darryl . Just stared . <p> Darryl did n't answer . <p> " You want to grow up to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood by the door , looking down . When he looked up , Jack Mitchell had put his hat on his head and was rising , no longer even looking at Darryl , looking past him . " Let 's go , " he said , and he carried his bulk through the door and out of the office . <p> Darryl followed , a few feet behind , his face trained on the ground . He looked steadily down because he felt tears fighting their way up , and if he could n't keep them in , he did n't want anybody to see . <p> " See you all tomorrow , " he heard Jack Mitchell say . <p> The two other Jacks grumbled . <p> Outside , Darryl followed Jack Mitchell 's round shadow to his Chrysler New Yorker . The tears were still there somewhere , but he felt that as long as Jack Mitchell did n't scold him anymore , he could keep them corralled on the inside . <p> Two would never cry like this . Two would go home and get his tail whipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but never like this . Two would get sent to bed and wake up tomorrow and all would be forgotten , because Two was just a boy growing up , like Mr. Waymans had once been a boy growing up , and it was expected that a boy growing up get into trouble like this . Spending all your money on games ! he could hear Mr. Waymans say , the whip of the belt singing the chorus : I sure ai n't ' bout to give you no more . But tomorrow all would be forgotten . Two would come out to play , Mr. Waymans staring on , his face quiet as a closed door , and all would be forgotten . <p> The inside of the car was too tight . Darryl was very close to Jack Mitchell and could n't distance himself at all . Inside himself , though , was infinite space in all directions and nowhere anything to hold onto . Behind his eyes , Darryl was in midair , in free fall , and he did n't know when he would hit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Behind his eyes , Darryl could see Grandpa Thevenet 's Sambo song and Hoodie Duncan 's wolfish leer and the twins ' clowning scorn , black faces in blackface , with wide red lips and bug eyes , and laughing .... These images , dancing in space behind his eyes , were all that Darryl could see . And inside he felt himself falling , falling , falling free . <p>
