For corporate America , the past decade was a time of easy money and hell- bent expansion . As capital poured in from eager lenders in the U.S. and overseas , American firms went on an unprecedented credit binge . Commercial IOUs soared from $829 billion in 1980 to $2 trillion last year , enabling corporations to finance a record number of buyouts , restructurings and stock buybacks . But with the economy on the verge of a recession and many businesses leveraged to the hilt , companies are struggling to shape up and reduce debt loads . " Corporations are discovering that debt is a double-edged sword , " says Edward Tyburczy , a senior vice president of Standard &; Poor 's , the debt- rating agency . " Those who lived and grew by the sword are now in danger of dying by it . " <P> An alarming number of U.S. companies have been crushed by debt this year . From January through September , some 44,000 firms have failed , an increase of nearly 15% from the same period in 1989 . The latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7-Eleven chain of convenience stores , which filed for Chapter 11 protection last month after failing to manage its $2 billion in obligations . Financial analysts warn that many other debt-ridden businesses could be headed for bankruptcy unless they find a way to lighten their load . None of the methods are easy , but many firms are doing just that . With the same zeal they showed for leveraging up , companies are vigorously deleveraging . Their techniques range from old-fashioned cost cutting to modern tactics like debt-for-equity swaps . <P> One of the most common methods to survive debt is to refinance . Lenders will usually keep extending a company 's debt , but often at higher interest rates on the new loans . At the moment , though , many lenders are pulling back because of rising defaults , so the refinancing option is becoming more remote . In fact , analysts warn that this has produced a credit crunch that could push many over-leveraged companies closer to failure . The situation is worst for firms that borrowed heavily by issuing junk bonds . The investment house that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burnham Lambert , has gone out of business , making the refinancing of such debt all but impossible . <P> Yet companies have other ways to restructure their debt , notably by using corporate stock . Firms in relatively good financial health can raise money by offering new shares on the market . Mr. Coffee , which was leveraged to the hilt as the result of a 1987 buyout , was able to wipe out almost half its LBO debt through a new issue last May . Another technique is the debt-for-equity swap , in which corporations retire their bonds by giving lenders corporate stock . That strategy was employed by furniture maker Interco , which last week announced that it will swap 95% of the stock in the company for $400 million worth of its bonds . But selling equity has become difficult in the bearish stock-market climate , and stockholders in troubled corporations often protest new issues that would dilute the value of their shares .
