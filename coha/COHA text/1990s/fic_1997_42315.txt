In the sequel to Golf in the Kingdom , the author returns to Scotland to search for his muse <p> Partly TO SATISFY MY lingering nostalgia , but also to further my research , I played golf at Burningbush on the day before my return to America . Though I had wondered if the round might evoke signs of Shivas Irons , I did n't expect the symmetries it produced . The first of these was evident when I reached the first tee a little before 12 o'clock . Thirty-one years before , I 'd been paired with Irons and a dour , methodical little Scotsman named MacIver . Now my playing partners would be a tall , red-haired west Texas professional named Sam Magee and a middle-aged Japanese gentleman about 5-foot-6 who referred to himself only as " Mitsubishi . " A threesome then , a threesome now , with members who had roughly the same height , build , and level of skill as their counterparts in 1956 . But this was n't all there was to it . Magee was instructing Mitsubishi with a booming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irons 's admonitions to MacIver . Mitsubishi listened to these attentively , just as MacIver had done , accepting them with quick little bows and applying them with an obedience which at first was painful to behold . After teeing his ball , he pointed with a ramrod-straight left arm down his intended line of flight , flexed his knees three or four times , and drove with a backswing no longer than one he would use for a pitch shot . His ball went straight , for perhaps 150 yards , whereupon he bowed to Magee again with a look of embarrassment combined with tightly controlled satisfaction . Then the professional turned to me . " Have at it , Murph , " he boomed , as if addressing a stadium filled with spectators . " Let it rip ! " Caught between a desire to be sociable and my hopes of playing with the concentration I 'd experienced at MacDuff 's estate , I took a few practice swings , teed my ball , and hit my drive straight down the fairway . " We 've got a ringer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , Mitsu . He 's dangerous . Do n't make any bets . " Then he hit a prodigious drive that almost reached the green . Walking down the fairway , I decided to keep enough separation from Magee for the revelations this round might produce . Though it was tempting to think that he might have resemblances to Shivas Irons beyond his red hair , height , and build , it was clear that if I got too close , there would be a whirlwind of challenges , wagers , and jibes that would last for 18 holes . This intuition was confirmed after we both got birdies , and he asked if I wanted to bet . How about $100 a side , $10 for the longest off each tee , $10 for the closest to each pin , $10 for each birdie , and $500 for the 18 ? When I did n't respond at once , he proposed cutting the wagers in half . When I said that I was n't in a betting mood , his interest in me faded . For the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention . On the slightly elevated second tee , I took my first long look at the course . The fairways were browner than they 'd been two weeks before , but framed more lavishly by yellow gorse and streaks of violet in the heather . A few cumulus clouds , their easterly edges trimmed in gold , were moving across the high blue sky , and the sea that was visible beyond the links , like a harlequin 's suit , was dramatically striped with lavender , blue , and grey . It occurred to me that these ever-changing vistas , like a hallucinogenic drug , amplified the slightest alterations of mood . This magical terrain , this soulscape , opened one 's consciousness to a greater freedom as well as an awareness of self-imposed sufferings . " After you , Murph , " Magee said in his Texas drawl . " Birdies first ! " My contemplative moment broken , I hit a drive down the left-hand side of the fairway , then watched as Magee and Mitsubishi hit theirs down the middle . I was grateful that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Shivas Irons were pressing in upon me . At first it seemed I could hear his voice , repeating advice he 'd given me , describing features of the course , or shouting encouragement to MacIver . But after two or three holes , kinesthetic images reinforced these auditory memories . This was n't a deliberate exercise . His carriage and gestures were suddenly there in my muscle memory , causing me to lengthen and loosen my stride , find a lower center of gravity , and add elasticity to my swing . By the ninth green , Magee had noticed this . " You 're swinging slower , and bigger , " he said , and then , to my astonishment , asked , " What 's come into you , Murph ? It 's like someone 's whisperin " in your ear . " Such are the ways we read one another telepathically . This phantom presence continued through the first 12 holes . At times it seemed he was standing near me , suggesting , perhaps by a subtle gesture , some readjustment of my swing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appraising my mental state with his sympathetic and contagious good humor . This invisible companionship varied in intensity , but when we reached the 13th tee it was suddenly magnified . This was more than muscle memory , or familiar visual imagery . Shivas Irons seemed about to precipitate into living flesh . As I looked across Lucifer 's Rug to the treacherous green on the hill above , I felt him aligning my stance , distributing my weight , and helping me grip my 2-iron so that I would hit a low fade against the wind that was blowing from right to left . All of this was accomplished , as if by telepathy , while Mitsubishi and Magee watched with apparent fascination . My ball sailed low up the clotted gorse , white against yellow as it curved toward the pin , then white against blue as it hovered above it . " F*** it , Murph ! " Magee exulted . " You might have a s***-faced hole in one ! " After teeing his ball , he focused more intently than he had all day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted two parallel streaks on the golf sky . Walking up the narrow path along the ravine that borders the hole , I thought of the shot I 'd hit in 1956 . It , too , had been guided by something beyond my normal reflexes . Then I pictured the unflappable Bailie MacIver , dressed from head to foot in white and black . Neither of us had spoken as we walked up the path , and I guessed that like me he 'd been emptied of thought by Shivas 's extraordinary rituals . He walked briskly , head down , his stride measured , intent to find his ball in Lucifer 's Rug . His expensive white pants and black cardigan sweater contrasted sharply with his unsmiling demeanor . Shivas had gone ahead , and stood near the green , looking down at the crevasse . For two or three minutes , as MacIver hit his ball from the gorse , he stood completely motionless . Was he looking for someone , or simply lost in thought ? After marking my ball , which sat just a foot from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move . There were tremendous views in all directions from this vantage point . The rolling fairways below were filling with the shadows that grace Scottish links when there 's sun in the late afternoon , while beyond the course , a mile and a half away , reflected light flashed from a clubhouse window . The land and sky seemed to be pure consciousness , a diaphanous soulscape . Then into it came a man in black who had something important to tell me . Standing at the edge of the green , he spoke without moving his lips . " Remember your name . Remember who you are . " Then he vanished . Just like that . Leaving no trace behind him . Shivas , it seemed , had n't seen him , and sank his putt for a birdie . Stunned , I placed my ball where I 'd marked it , and rolled it into the cup . Each of us had scored a two , but Shivas said nothing about it . As we walked to the 14th tee , he gave no hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putt for a birdie , just as Shivas had done , and I sank mine as well . But as I lifted my ball from the cup , I remembered that the man in black had said something more before he vanished . " Ye 'll not remember , " he 'd said with a Scottish burr that I now seemed to hear with perfect clarity . " You and Shivas are brothers . Ye 'll never be completely separated . Part o " ye will travel with him wherever he goes , even to the ends of the Earth . " Astonished by this small reverberating voice , which was conveyed with the peculiar resonance and force of an auditory hallucination , I turned away from my playing partners . Shivas and I would never be separated completely . Secretly , I 'd known it all along . Which meant that my search for him reflected , however imperfectly , his movements , activities , and whereabouts . Sensing that something had disturbed me , but not knowing what it was , Magee and Mitsubishi hit their drives in silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled me with gratitude . " I 'm sorry , " I said as I stepped to the tee . " This place calls up the damnedest memories . " As both of them nodded in agreement , I felt a sudden unexpected affection for them . Magee 's attitude especially , which seemed strikingly at odds with his manner when we 'd met , reminded me again that golf has a genius for bringing out what is best in us . As we played the next few holes keeping a respectful distance , my encounter with the figure in black continued to unfold . Like a slowly sprouting seed , my memory of it had emerged for 31 years in response to different stimuli , whether conversation with Shivas and his friends in 1956 , reports of golfing epiphanies from readers of Golf in the Kingdom , or my walk two weeks before around the 13 th green . Our exchange seemed more real now than it had when I first remembered it . The stranger 's voice conveyed an urgency and impulsion from somewhere beyond my ordinary thoughts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go with Shivas wherever he went , I could hear the voice condensing still into words that were perfectly articulated with a Scottish inflection . It was difficult now to focus on golf . Every hole of the inward nine brought reminders of my round with Shivas Irons . Shot by shot , my game deteriorated , partly because of my excitement , partly because of a gratitude I could n't explain , but also because I was struggling with doubts . It was possible that the voice I 'd heard came from subconscious confabulation . Like certain dreams , the man in black might have been my own production , an ingenious wish fulfillment , another attempt to find what I 'd lost when I walked away from Shivas Irons . If part of me would follow him wherever he went , parts of me would not . On the 18th green , remembering the shining presence that opened at his side , I felt an instinctive resistance . If it made another appearance , my contraction would be just as immediate as it had been in 1956 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we walked to the starter 's shack . " That was one f**ing shot on the three par . And Mitsu ? What a round you played ! What did ya shoot ? " Mitsubishi was putting the last touches on his scorecard . " Ah , Magee ! " he exclaimed . " You have 67 . I shoot 84 . And Murphy , you shoot 86 ! Thirty-four on the front side , 52 on the back . Not bad ! " In 1956 I 'd shot the same score , but with 34 on the back side and 52 on the front . Then I remembered that Shivas had shot 67 , and MacIver an 84 . Certain fateful coincidences are not confabulated , and they can not be produced through wish fulfillment . After changing shoes at the starter 's shack , I stood by the clubhouse , divided . An American member had gotten me access to its storied meeting room , but the rules and sociability I was likely to find there might make it hard to assimilate what I 'd experienced during this remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further clues to the activities and whereabouts of Shivas Irons . With its high paneled walls and ceiling , and its mementos of a treasured past , the spacious room impressed me again with its warmth and rich sense of tradition . I had been here twice before : the first time in 1956 , accompanied by Shivas Irons ; the second time in 1970 , with ah introduction from a friend who was a member . It was not an easy place to visit . Women were not allowed . I was here as a friend of Grant Spaeth , soon to be president of the United States Golf Association . None of the men in the room were familiar to me . Sonny Liston , the affable presence who 'd served me on my previous visits , had left Burningbush a few years before , and none of the members I 'd seen were in evidence . The handsome young barman had n't heard of Shivas Irons , Seamus MacDuff , or the other people I 'd met in 1956 . When I realized that he had no leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a window that faced the 18th green . It was a good place to recapture the hour I 'd spent in this room with Shivas Irons . He 'd been a magnetic presence that night , from the moment we walked through the door . " What ye " doin " to the lad ? " a man named Burns had shouted when we entered . " Takin " his money , Mr. Irons ? Or his mind ? Or his soul ! " Shivas had only nodded in response , while telling me loudly to disregard him . Then Burns had shouted something back . By the time we reached the bar , it seemed that everyone in the place had turned to see us . Waiting for drinks at the bar , I turned to survey the room . The paneled wall above us was adorned with a tartan kilt and crossed swords hung in a great gold frame , and photographs of Old Tom Morris , young Tom Morris , Harry Vardon , Bobby Jones , and other renowned golfers . On the other walls there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince of Wales , and two or three British prime ministers . Some of these imposing figures wore costumes of the 18th century . After Sonny Liston poured us each a glass of whiskey , I asked if they 'd spoken in Gaelic . " It 's English , " said Shivas . " Not the King 's kind , but the language as spoken by Robert Burns . " Then he turned in the direction of the man named Burns and , with a resonant voice , recited these lines by the great Scottish poet : Let other poets raise a fracas " Bout vines , an " wines , an " drucken Bacchus , An " crabbit names an " stories wrack us , An " grate our lug ; I sing the juice Scotch bear can mak us , In glass or jug . Several men turned as his voice rose , and some responded with other lines celebrating Scotch drink . A group near the fireplace lifted their glasses toward us . The recitations had triggered a show of friendship that stretched across the entire room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaimed another stanza from Burns : An now , Auld Cloots , I ken ye re thinkin , A certain Bardie 's rantin , drinkin , Some luckless hour will send him linkin , To your black Pit ; But , faith ! he 'll turn a corner jinkin , An " cheat you yet . " The devil does n't have us yet , my friend . " Shivas lifted his glass toward Burns . " Yer ancestor , if he was indeed yer ancestor , would 've agreed ! " " You 're too confident , Mr. Irons . " The man nodded toward me . " I hate to think what trouble you 're visitin " upon that handsome young man . " Burns shouldered his way between us and demanded that Liston serve us more drinks . He was a burly man , about an inch shorter than Shivas 's 6-foot-3 , and over his dark brown jacket and tie , he wore a matching cape . " When ye recite tha " poem , " he said , " we know ye 're up to somethin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the young man have a mind of his own . " Shivas placed a hand on his shoulder . " Burns , " he said , " have faith . The man can hold his own . " He introduced us , and Burns shook my hand with a powerful grip . He had strong features reddened by drink and the elements . " So what 's he tellin " ye ? " Burns leaned back to appraise me with an eyebrow cocked . " About his holein-one on the moon ? Or his match with Old Tom Morris ? Or how he beat Ben Hogan ! " Another member approached , then a third and a fourth . Soon Shivas stood in a spirited group , trading mock insults , toasts , and challenges . Watching this ebullient exchange , I took the glass of whiskey that Liston gave me and moved away without anyone 's seeming to notice . Grateful for a chance to be alone , I sat by the fireplace . Though there was light of the gloaming outside , the fire cast shadows on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above me . One in particular caught my eye . It depicted a fierce-looking , bearded man who 'd been a colonel in Queen Victoria 's Indian regiments . Later Shivas would tell me that a Himalayan yogi had taught him to walk as if he were levitating . The men at the bar were singing now , and the high , dark walls began to glow as the light outside grew dimmer . The wind , the sea , the summer grass had left their traces in me . Looking across the darkening links , listening to cheers from the 18th green , I sensed that everything was happening inside the greater body we secretly inhabit . But as the hour passed , my mind and senses began to fall from this state of grace . Perhaps it was the dulling that follows the immediate liberations of whiskey , or simply my nerves " inability to sustain this encompassing joy , but questions began to trouble me . In the philosophy department at Stanford University , where philosophic and linguistic analyses were in their ascendancy , there had been general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us knowledge of things outside the self . As one professor had told me , a mystic 's asserting he 'd seen angels or God simply meant that he felt good . For all I knew , my elevations on the inward nine had come from hypoglycemia . Warmed by the friendship that filled the room , and resonating still with the magic of our golf round , I realized that I was closer than ever to the illuminations I would seek in India . And yet I was starting to doubt them . And now , 31 years later , sitting in the same convivial place , I felt a similar conflict . If part of me would go with Shivas Irons , as the stranger had said , parts of me would not . My resistance to him seemed as strong as it had been in 1956 . But somehow that was n't disturbing . There were leads to him everywhere , some hidden in the depths of my memory , some appearing from the world at large in response to the search I shared with Buck Hannigan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several ways to find him . And , for the first time , I was beginning to sense that , in some mysterious way , he was reaching out to me .
