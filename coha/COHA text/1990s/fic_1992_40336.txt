Ruth was dressing for Vicky 's party when Carl came home and told her he had lost the turkey . She lowered both ends of her necklace and looked at him . She thought , Of course you did . It was a big moment there in the bedroom , Ruth sitting on the bed , Carl standing before her , frowning in concentration , his palms out , and before he could shift his weight or begin anything , she saw him as if for the first time , her husband , a handsome man who had been bright and clever and who was still a good lawyer , but who was , as he stood pantomiming what he might have done with the smoked turkey for Vicky 's party , a man who had spent years growing vague . <p> Carl thought hard . " I 'm in Canyon Market off of Foothill ... " <p> " Can you help me with this ? " Ruth handed him the necklace . It was a string of small copper disks which they had purchased on last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now as if it were a puzzle , and Ruth could see his mind was somewhere else . <p> Carl had been her mainstay ; at one time she had counted on him . But now he was gone , lost in another battle with Gerver , totally preoccupied with his own stress . He came home these days and did TV  --  smoking his cigars , shoes on the couch  --  that being his phrase as he raised a hand to quiet whatever question she might ask : " Not now , honey , okay ? I 'm doing TV here , do you see ? " On the screen a man would be pressing both fists into his eyes trying to think on The Family Feud  --  " things at a wedding shower . " And after doing TV , Carl came to bed and wanted to mount her like a moment 's information , a newsbreak . There had been times like this before in this marriage , and as soon as Carl or Gerver relented , changed their memos , shook hands , he would be back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now Ruth sat on the bed and looked at Carl as he tried to figure out why he had a necklace in his hands . <p> But it was her son , Sean , a boy best described by the ridiculous phrase " the apple of her eye , " who had Ruth most upset . It was what she had heard him say . He night sometimes if there was popcorn or ice cream and Carl was asleep on the couch . They 'd watch TV together and comment on the characters , and Sean was always surprising her with his observations . " You can tell the total mental state of a person by watching him in the left-turn lane , " and during love scenes he 'd point at the screen and say , " It 's some kind of bonding maneuver , as far as I can tell . " Sometimes he would remove his sleeping father 's shoes and say , " Dad , you 've got to learn to respect the furniture . " And sometimes it was Ruth who slept on the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to hear Sean tell Carl about the track coach or the debate trip . Those nights covered her like a blanket , and she could feel the soft electricity of it in the backs of her legs , too much and not enough at the same time , these men , talking . <p> This was the summer of vintage clothing . Sean and his friend David were into old clothes . They 'd raid the Deseret Industries thrift shops and come home in three-piece suits and wide silk ties hand-painted with animals and birds . Sean mowed the lawn in vests , and the two boys played tennis in pleated trousers . It was Ruth 's joy to see them on lounge chairs in the backyard like two barefoot bankers , their ties loosened in the sun . Eventually they 'd carefully disrobe , hanging their garments on the pool furniture until the baggy trousers came off , revealing their swimsuits , and they 'd dive into the blue water . <p> Lately there had been a third in this game , Dorie , also a sophomore at Suburban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose friend she was . David was smoother , more confident and gregarious , but Sean was tall and  --  the only word Ruth could think of  --  pretty in a Ricky Nelson kind of way . Dorie was over two or three times a week in flowered skirts and billowy blouses , looking like something primed for a country weekend , sometimes a blue or beige suit , the jacket and tight skirt making her look ready to go off to the office . " This hat , " Dorie would say . " Fifty cents . " And she 'd turn to show the large straw hat , its band a colorful wrap of red silk . <p> Mostly Ruth was n't included . She watched the three young people from her kitchen window . They tuned the radio to KOY , a station that played only music from the Forties and Fifties , Patti Page , Perry Como , Glenn Miller , Tony Bennett ; it was hilarious . Ruth 's friend Vicky stood with her one day at the sink watching the young people and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel so young . " That day at the window , Vicky had said , " They think they 're in a movie . I remember it , the feeling . You sit around with your fingers under your chin waiting for someone to ask you what 's the matter . It 's the age of loveliness . Everything is terribly important and terribly lovely . " <p> The women watched Dorie stand and slowly unbutton the front of her blouse and place it on the back of her chair . She moved to the pool 's edge  --  in a sleek one-piece that showed her more woman than Ruth would have imagined  --  where she stood for a dive . Vicky said , " Who is that ? " <p> Your son is fifteen , Ruth thought . This is his fifteenth summer , and you are the iced-tea lady now . In three years he 'll be gone . And she was the iced-tea lady , kidding them about their getups as she set the large plastic tumblers on the small tables by the pool . They ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the source of iced tea . Sometimes she hummed along with the ridiculous music . She watched them from her window with nothing so much as pure feeling , three beautiful kids in the sunshine , dressed for the Forties . <p> It was vintage everything , really . The word itself came out almost too often . David would appear at their door in a brown suit two sizes too large and wave a videocassette , saying , " This is a classic . This is vintage Karloff . " The young people watched old films in the den , black-and-white horror films , and lounged so deeply in the furniture it was as if they were hiding . When Ruth came through the room from time to time , she looked for clues about who was with whom , but the alliances were never clear . Some days Dorie lay on the couch like an actress , the boys in the two big chairs , some days she sat with David there , and then some days she sat on the floor in front of Sean 's chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily through the open terrace doors or Dracula opening his caped arms and turning into a bat . She liked having the kids around the house , though they did n't see her , but she could tell things were changing . The nights Sean would go down to David 's for dinner or a movie , she would work at her desk , pretend to , and then double-check the porch light . It was hard to read . She was n't used to this new thing , waiting for her son to return . <p> And then , of course , something snapped . Last night , as Ruth was rinsing her serving tray , she heard through her open window her son talking to David in the blue night of the backyard . Over the humming of the pool filter pump , Sean was speaking , his voice printed on her life forever , and she heard the words before she had a chance to disbelieve them : " Yeah , " she heard him say . " She is such a cunt . " Ruth felt her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tray in her hands . <p> " Okay , okay , " Carl went on . " I can get this . " But he was n't talking about the necklace . " I spoke to the butcher , and he said that it would be a minute . Then I ran into Vicky . " Carl had forgotten about the necklace in his hand and was gesturing , setting up imaginary places in the grocery store . He was being logical and retracing his steps . " And she said something about something ... " <p> " She said she 'd see us tonight at the party and that we 're going to meet her new boyfriend , the Texan . " Ruth took the necklace back from him and tried to fasten it again . <p> " Right . That 's it . " Then Carl looked at her with surprise . " And she said Tom Gerver 's coming . His wife is one of your accounts ? Something . " <p> " That 's right . " <p> Carl shook off the distance and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the counter . " Carl hoisted the imaginary bag . " And when I went up front to the checkout I found I did n't have any cash ... " Here Carl thrust his hands into his pockets until he fished out a paper slip . " So I put it on Visa . " He paused and read the slip very slowly : " Smoked turkey : $34.44 . " <p> " What 's the program ? " Sean said , dropping a shoulder against their doorway . He was wearing a brown suit vest over a white T-shirt . His trousers were cinched tight around his narrow waist , but they still sagged . " Who 's feeding you guys tonight ? " Ruth had avoided him since last night , and now with the sound of his voice she felt her heart contract . " We 'll be at Vicky 's , " she said carefully . " What are your plans ? " <p> Sean took two steps to Ruth and lifted the necklace from her hands . Deftly he dipped it around her neck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still in the grocery store . " There was a girl behind me with a new baby , and "  --  Carl turned to where she would have stood  --  " I helped her . " <p> " I 'll be here , " Sean said . " David and Dorie may come over . " <p> " And I took the baby . " Now Carl 's hands were really full . " It was raining ... her car was next to mine , " Carl seemed to be reading off the ceiling . " She opened the door  --  it 's a two-door , and I put the baby in his car seat in the back . " <p> " Dad , you are such a hero . " <p> " And ... I ... " Carl dropped his arms and sat on the bed . " God , I do n't know . I drove home . I do n't know where it is . I lost the turkey . " <p> " Want me to check the car ? " <p> " No , I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't matter , " Ruth said , feeling her neck stiffen . " Call the market and ask them to set aside another . We 'll pick it up on the way . Get dressed , Carl . Let 's go meet Vicky 's friend . " <p> When she stood , Sean said , " You look good , Mom . A little modern , but good . David thinks you 're a babe . " Ruth left the room . She could hear the men talking behind her . <p> The theme of the party , Ruth had forgotten , was tequila . There were trays of shooters and Sunrises , and every plate on the buffet had a little card attached that read " Tequila " something or other , " Tequila Fettuccine , " " Tequila Jamboree . " It was still raining lightly , and Vicky 's house was crowded with dozens of people . Vicky brought a man over and introduced Ruth and Carl . His name was actually Bo and he was from Houston or near there and he did something with land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely saw anymore , something a man does on purpose . A black line along the top of his lip . <p> As Ruth and Carl laid out their tray , Vicky stuck a little " Tequila Turkey " sign on the platter . She handed Ruth a sweet Sunrise , which puckered Ruth 's mouth . " Battery acid , " Vicky said , pointing to the hinge of her jaw . " They give you a little sizzle right there , do n't they ? Battery acid . You get it from chocolate and beer too . " Vicky looked at Ruth and asked , " What 's the matter ? " <p> " Nothing . Something . Somebody in our house is fifteen . " <p> " Who ? Carl ? " <p> " Funny . We 're doing growth at our house , " Carl said . " You can feel the limits groaning . " Ruth looked at her husband and thought , How would you know ? <p> Tom Gerver came up behind Carl and nodded at Ruth as a greeting . He took Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which Ruth could only interpret as a good sign . <p> " Is Sean still dressing for dinner ? " Vicky asked . <p> Ruth nodded , aware she did n't want to talk about it really . There was something too personal about it , this summer . A moment later Vicky pointed to where Bo was making drinks at the bar table . " So , how do you like him ? " <p> " He seems quite ... manly . " <p> Vicky smiled . " Do n't you hate it , " she said . " If it were n't for that trait , they 'd be all right . Actually , he 's a nice guy . A little too willing to please . Very considerate . Very ... in bed it 's this and that for three hours . Newly divorced men are like that . " <p> Vicky went over and escorted him into the party . Throughout the evening as Ruth drifted through the rooms , a lot of her friends commented on how tall Sean was now , and there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who thought he had decided to run for office and those who thought he was going into the ministry . Everyone said the word " fifteen " wistfully . " Fifteen , " one older woman said . " Wonderful fifteen . It 's the first time you 'd like to sell them . " <p> Ruth relished being alone at the party , not engaging in long discussions , just wandering from room to room . Several people complimented her on her necklace , and she had a feeling she had n't had in a long time  --  since parties at her sorority house  --  that something was going to happen next . <p> The rain let up sometime after eleven , and as groups of people began to venture out onto the back deck Ruth searched the house for Carl . The doors and windows were open , and the fresh cool air seemed like fall . She found him flat on his back in the wet side yard , side by side with his buddy Tom Gerver , both of them absolutely drunk . From the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass , it looked as if they had fallen from an airplane . <p> " Hi , honey , " Carl said . " Tom and I were taking a break . " <p> As she helped Carl up , Tom said , " You 're a good woman , Ruth . " He rose to an elbow and said with drunken sincerity , " I 'm sorry about your turkey . " <p> Ruth did n't care that Carl was so far gone or that she 'd have to drive home . She 'd driven him home before and she was relieved that he seemed to have made peace with Tom . When they were in the car , he was chatty . " What 's bugging you about Sean ? " he asked . " I like his girlfriend . " He folded his arms , then , finding they did n't fit , refolded them . They were waiting to turn left onto their street . <p> " How does he know about necklaces ? " <p> " What ? " Carl looked at her . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " What is it ? What is there ? " Carl pointed down the empty roadway . " You can turn now , Ruth . There 's nobody coming . " <p> Ruth measured the turn with exaggerated care . " She 's not his girlfriend , " she said . <p> At home the house was empty though the television was on . Ruth stood and watched it for a moment  --  a high-rise building was burning . Carl slumped through the room , his eyes half-shut , waving both palms at her and going straight to bed . Ruth sat down and slipped off her shoes . On television now , two blond men smeared with camouflage grease in sleeveless T-shirts , carrying automatic weapons , detonators , and a strange metallic sphere , entered an elevator . This is where Sean would say to her , " Those are the bad guys , Mom . " It was one of their jokes  --  the way she had always talked to him as a child when he watched television . Ruth watched the screen . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a cunt . " Several of the upper stories of the building exploded , spraying fans of white sparks into the night . <p> Leaving the television on , Ruth went into the kitchen and made herself a scotch and water . She wandered back through the house , every room , straightening things in the dark , her desk  --  so clean already  --  Sean 's bed  --  neat too  --  in a room so clearly still a boy 's , the walls all athletes and animals , his first debate trophy on the shelf ( Carl 's phrase , " Your first " ) . In the glowing dark she touched the dish of change on his bureau and then suddenly became self-conscious , her face warm , as if she 'd been going through his pockets , and she moved into the hallway and then to the front of the house , making sure again that the porch light was on . <p> Back in the dark kitchen , she poured another short splash of scotch and went through the French doors onto the pool deck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could smell the wet cement as it dried in the night and she could hear the clacking of the palm fronds above the neighbor 's yard . She walked out around the pool and sat on the side of the diving board . From here her dark yard and house seemed vast , another landscape . Shapes slowly emerged , the lumps of towels , the deck tables , Sean 's suit jacket on the back of a chair . <p> When she heard the laugh she felt it as something sharp in her chest , and then she heard it again , an alto note that could not be suppressed , and a warmth spread down her arms . " Sean ? " she said , her voice strange , reedy , and then louder : " Sean ? " Now she could n't hear anything in the mix of the pool pump , the palm fronds ' dry whispers . " Sean ? " She could n't see anything in the dark reflections of the water or the windows of the house , and she realized she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now or walk to the house ; it was the strangest feeling and it would n't let her speak again either . And for a moment in the liquid night she was that still , not calm , but not panicked either , just kept there by the weight of the two sounds she 'd heard and known about all along . <p> Beneath her she saw the water ripple and heard it lapping at the tile in a new way , then the surface broke in a dark oval which became a face , silver under hair as black and varnished as a movie star 's from the Twenties . She did n't recognize him at first , his face , until he reached for the side of the pool and she saw his wrist and forearm , then heard his wet , suppressed breath . <p> " Sean ? " <p> " Yeah . Mom , hi . Party over ? " His voice was thick , husky , a whisper . <p> " Is that David ? " Ruth looked out into the dark where she knew Dorie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just left , " Sean said . He was treading water now , staying away from her . <p> " It 's after midnight , Sean . " <p> " Really ? Okay . " <p> Ruth now heard Dorie 's body rise from the pool , the short rush of water in the far dark , and before her son 's next plaintive " Mom ? " a word so saturated with pleading that she found it almost repulsive , the light in the kitchen went on around the shape of her husband . The light fell in a cartoonish square across the patio , and Ruth saw Dorie stand casually as if to meet it , so casually it hurt , and drop the towel the way she would if alone after a shower , her body here only white , her arms , her high breasts white , as she lifted her shift over her head and began to wriggle into it . <p> " Mom ? " her son said again from the water . <p> But coming out of the house now like a figure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying a liter bottle of Perrier was her husband , and he said , " Ruth ? Ruth ? I put it in her car . " He became a dark shadow before her . He did n't know his son drifted in the water at his feet nor was he aware of the girl dressing behind him  --  who now knelt and busily worked at her shoes . <p> Ruth said nothing and then she said , " Carl . " <p> " It 's raining in the parking lot . Do you see , I know what happened . " He gestured with the bottle of water and his free hand . <p> " When the girl flopped the front seat forward so I could reach in and put the baby in the car seat  --  see it ? It 's raining . The ground is wet . I put the bag on the floor there behind the front seat . " <p> There was movement behind Carl , and Ruth saw Dorie slip out the side gate . And Sean was in the water beneath her , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was now only black-and-white . She stood up . <p> " Hey , " Carl said . " Is that Sean ? " <p> And Ruth felt then the whole world take hold and her heart , her body , flood with wonder . And even trying , she could n't stop from taking half a step back like an actress in a bad film , her hands raised in defense , in denial , as her eyes actually widened . She saw it ; she saw it all . She saw these strangers . It was stark and clear . And she had been brought here from some other place at this point in her life , forty years of age , to live with them . <p> Ron Carlson is the author of The News of the World , a collection of short stories .
