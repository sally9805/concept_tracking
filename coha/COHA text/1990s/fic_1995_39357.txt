One day Will arrived at work to find a new receptionist sitting behind the front desk , and all that morning he found himself contemplating his brief glimpse of her . She was a large woman , not just in size but also in the boldness of her features  --  her eyes were big and blue , her cheeks were daubed in bright rouge , her lips were red and full . Moving between his desk to the bathroom and back , Will showered her with lances , but offered just a flicker of a smile . <p> More than a mere convenience , the office bathroom was a sanctuary for Will . He would sit down in one of the stalls , rest his head in his arms , and listen to the quiet groaning of the skyscraper 's plumbing . It was a very modern building on Fifty-second Street , <p> thin streak of black poking aggressively into the sky . On stormy days Will sat for long periods of time and listened to it sway . <p> Will worked at a bank , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a permanent temp , a condition that suited him , as this was not his intended career . He had just dropped out of divinity school at Yale when he took the job , and he was only going to keep it until he could figure out what he was going to do next . Gradually , however , what he was doing now and what he was going to do next merged into the same thing . His job was similar to that of a monk copying scripture by hand , except in this case what he was copying : were loan agreements acquired by some sleight of hand from another bank . It was supposed to take six months . A year had passed , and no end was in sight . The corporate salesmen in the office had caught his eye . They were cheerful , energetic men in well-tailored suits whose arrivals and departures were always accompanied by great flurries of activity , and he felt a twinge of admiration for them . Something crass and materialistic was stirring within him , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be rich , to be a mover and shaker , a man of surfaces . <p> His reasons for dropping out of divinity school were complicated , and he had a hard time explaining them to the many people who were confused and concerned by his decision , including his girlfriend , Liza , who shortly thereafter became his ex-girlfriend . The best analogy he could come up with was that of a musician who is suddenly gripped by performance anxiety and no longer wants to play his instrument before an audience  --  the audience in this case being God . In fact , he had come to the private conclusion that there was no audience . <p> All morning a parade of people came in and out of the office , most of them welcoming the new receptionist warmly , some just nodding . If someone got a call and was n't at his or her desk , she got to page the person over the office intercom . Every few minutes she would have her own mini-performance for an audience of about forty . Several fashion magazines lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of La Traviata . She was looking at one of the magazines when she first met Will , who was returning from yet another trip to the men 's room . <p> " Did I get any calls just now ? " he said brusquely . <p> " Um , you 're .. " <p> " Will . Hi . " He smiled for a moment . <p> " No , no calls , Will . " His name came off her tongue with something approaching familiarity . She spoke slowly and her words had just a hint of a Southern accent around the edges . <p> " Oh , " he said , staring at her thoughtfully . " Good . " He was of medium build with dark hair and thin black eyebrows that were just slightly askance , giving him a perpetually expectant look . <p> " Well , Will , " she said . " I 'm Marla . And how are you doing today ? " <p> " Fine , " he said , and then added , " Bored . Extremely bored . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to , " she said . " What I 'm doing is n't exactly fascinating , either . But ...  --  and here she sighed in a somewhat dramatic manner  --  " it gets me through school . " <p> " School ? " he said , raising his eyebrows as though it were a piece of slang he had n't yet heard . <p> " I 'm here to study opera at the Juilliard School of Music , " she said brightly . " I 've already performed down in Austin , where I 'm from . " <p> Something about her enthusiasm embarrassed him  --  suddenly he was very self-conscious of his hands . " That 's nice , " he said , and turned to go back into the office . <p> " Seen the new receptionist ? " Will said to his co-worker , Hoffman . <p> Their desks faced each other in a small fluorescent-lit room . The vice president in charge of the division  --  a loud , over-friendly man whose ambition was as evident as a dog 's lust while it humps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered a snappy title for their project : " Info-War Among the two soldiers , however , moral was low . <p> " Yup . Saw her , " said Hoffman , and did n't move his eyes from the page in front of him . <p> " She 's really quite , you know ... " Will paused , trying to figure out just what word he was looking for . " Nice , " he said finally , though this was n't what he meant . " Nice " was the word for everyone else in the office , the kind of " Let 's just be nice to one another so we can get through this damn situation , all right ? " brand of friendliness that Will despised . Marla was something else . " She 's an opera singer , " he said . " Did you know that ? And from Texas . An aspiring opera star from Texas . " <p> When Hoffman made no response , Will stared at him , at the clean creases of his dress shirt , the tight knot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just below , which , despite hours of rehearsal in front of a mirror , Will had not been able to duplicate . Hoffman was one of those men who seem to have been born with an innate understanding of how to choose a suit , how to knot a tie , how to walk around with a cool , handsome expression that would be as appropriate for an office party as it would for foreclosing on a family farm . Will had taken great satisfaction in Hoffman 's one discernible flaw : a skin problem of some sort on his right index finger , which left it dry and scaly and which had prompted the fingernail to attempt an evacuation . Will would stare at that finger , mesmerized as it made the small squiggly motion of handwriting , and imagine what internal terrors it represented . <p> It was the morning of Marla 's arrival that Hoffman , with the air of someone involved in high-level espionage , announced his plans to leave the company and start his own business , a newsletter that reported on the nondestructive testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test destructively , " said Will . <p> " Nondestructive testing is a way of testing things like airplanes and nuclear reactors without actually taking them apart , or trying to damage them to see if they hold up , " said Hoffman . " It uses ultrasonic waves , infrared light , radiology , things like that . It 's the testing of the future . There 's no harm . " <p> " Experiments with no risk , " Will said . He liked the metaphysical possibilities for something like this . His life had been full of tests and experiments , and most of them , it seemed , had been fairly destructive . A year and a half earlier , he had had a career and a girlfriend , for example , and now he had neither . <p> At three o'clock Will was seized with a desperate craving for something sweet . It was as instinctive as the odd habit he had of waking up one minute before his alarm went off every morning . He fiercely tried to resist , but to no avail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsstand to buy a candy bar . On his way out today , he paused , quite impulsively , in front of Marla . <p> " How 're you doing ? " he said , cheered by the sight of her . He caught himself in the ridiculous arabesque pose he sometimes affected when he was trying to imply that he had been up late the preceding night doing something fabulously interesting . He corrected himself immediately and stood up straight . <p> " Just fine , " she said , and her voice filled the room . It was dear , friendly , melodious , and slightly melodramatic  --  the kind of voice that would be equally appropriate for the evening news or phone sex . All day he had been listening to it page people over the office intercom . He smiled at her . <p> She smiled back . Her skin was smooth and clear except for a faint birthmark just below her left temple , the color and shape of a coffee stain . <p> He stood there struggling for something to say . After a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his candy bar . He rode down with an attractive woman whose prim , constrained manner seemed like an active rebellion against her pretty features and full hips . In this regard she reminded him of Liza , who was always worried about her weight , in spite of the fact she had a lovely figure . He had teased her that no matter how much weight she lost , she would always have a nice juicy ass for everyone to see . He told her that he had been fat when he was younger and she was so amused by this , and amazed , since he showed no signs of it now , that she started calling him Fatty , until he asked her very seriously to stop . He saw his early fatness as a kind of purgatory through which he had suffered , and the thought of what he had endured in grade school still made him shudder . <p> When he returned to the office , Marla was handling several calls at once . The switchboard was filled with blinking red lights . Her large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny buttons , and her face had a look of confused concentration  --  the blank expression of the kid in a seventh grade spelling bee who , when confronted with the word " friend , " is stumped . He had been that kid . Her lips were slightly parted , red and glossy , turned down a bit at the corners . <p> He imagined something white and sticky splattering across that open mouth . The image arrived with such sudden intensity that he turned the corner into the office area with a slightly shocked look on his face , as though he had just stepped over a pornographic photo lying face-up on the street . <p> The next day Will arrived in his usual morning stupor and flew past Marla with hardly a nod . He was late , and the vice president had recently posted a letter in the office lunchroom that read : " I have noticed an increase in tardiness among the staff . THIS WILL STOP . " Against all rationality , Will suspected the vice president was making a subliminal communication to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his hands-on , **31;382;TOOLONG moods , and so Will had to forgo his bathroom respites . He worked right through lunch . He could n't get away until midafternoon , and by then he had completely forgotten about Marla . Her voice , normally so musical and intriguing to him when it wafted over the intercom , had become part of the background drone of the office . <p> When he saw her , he came up short . She was wearing a very sharp two-piece jacket-and-skirt outfit with a checkered pattern , and a white dress shirt with some frills around the collar . Her light brown hair was pulled in a knob-like bun behind her head , and a few minor curls escaped around her neck . It was the Female Executive as Impersonated by Receptionist look . <p> " Hi , there , " she said . " Where 've you been ? " <p> " Drowning , " he said . <p> " I did n't know there was a pool back there , " she said . " I 'll have to bring my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the grueling day , was not ready for this abstraction . He abruptly turned and started to head for his candy bar . Then he had a strange impulse and turned around to face Marla . <p> " Do you have any candy ? " he asked . <p> " Candy ? " she said . He was about to turn away and head downstairs when her face performed one of its dramatic changes ; it took on the expression of a shoplifter caught red-handed . <p> " Yes , I do , " she said with a slightly confessional fervor , and started to rummage around the large leather bag that served as her purse . " Here . " She held out a small white paper bag . " Take the whole thing . I do n't want any . I should n't have even bought them . " <p> Will walked over and took the bag from her . She seemed relieved to have it out of her hand . It was half full . <p> He looked at her with a slightly confused expression , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all , I should n't have even bought it . " <p> In that short sentence , Will found more emotion than anything he had heard uttered at work in the year he had been there , and he found his sudden proximity to a human being at once exhilarating and distasteful . Inside the bag was a small cache of little coffee bean-shaped chocolates . They were the sort of candy his grandmother used to have in a bowl on the coffee table when he came for a visit . They were bittersweet . They were refined . <p> " Coffee beans , " he said , peering into the bag . <p> " They 're good . They 're much better than the Reese 's Peanut Butter Cups and that sort of junk me and my roommate eat most of the time . " <p> " I 'll just take one , " he said . <p> " No ! Really , take the whole thing . " <p> He took two and handed the bag back to her , pleased at this newfound ability to torture her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way down in the elevator , he ate one ; it tasted just as remembered , refined and discrete , bittersweet . He put the other one on his desk , and he glanced at it periodically , the way one might glance at a pebble taken from a beach long ago and remember the whole vacation . <p> The next day , on his way back from lunch , Will presented Marla with a present . <p> " I have something for you , " he said , and leaned against the wooden counter in front of her . <p> " You have something for me ? " said Marla , and swung her chair around toward him , her voluptuous body performing a kind of twist while seated . Her shoulders and breasts came at him with alarming velocity ; her face wore an expression of excited anticipation , as though she were thinking , " What a nice man , " but it also had an element of mock surprise , the expression of an adult receiving a present from a little boy . <p> Their eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung his arm out from behind his back , a Hershey 's chocolate bar sitting in the middle of his pink hand . <p> Marla bit her lower lip . <p> " With almonds , " he said . <p> " Oh she said . " Thank you . That 's nice of you . " <p> " Just returning the favor , " <p> " I should n't . " <p> " I thought you liked chocolate . " <p> " I love chocolate , " she said , " But I should n't . " <p> Will almost said , " Why not ? " but decided this was too cruel . <p> " Tell you what , " he said . " I 'll leave it here , and you can eat it if you want . " He put the chocolate bar down right in front of her , smiled , and walked back into his office without saying another word . When he came by later that afternoon , it had disappeared . He peeked conspicuously at the place where he had left it and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . <p> This turned into a daily ritual . Will would return from his snack errand and deposit a chocolate bar in front of Marla , who would protest vehemently . <p> " Do n't , please do n't , " she would say . Or she would say , " You 're spoiling me . " And once : " You 're only doing this because you know I ca n't resist . " <p> A secretary watched the exchange and said , " How come you keep bringing her candy when she says she does n't want any ? " <p> Will shrugged . " Maybe she does n't mean it , " he said , to which the secretary responded with a disapproving look . <p> " Oh , he knows I love it , " he heard Marla say as he walked away . <p> Outwardly , these exchanges resembled the polite , empty cheerfulness that pervaded all the interactions in the office . Will liked that . The surface propriety rendered it a non-event , an exchange that need n't have any consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the farthest extremes . <p> He imagined her onstage , her full , shapely body and naked optimism the focus of everyone 's attention , her mouth issuing a dramatic high-pitched note . It was a stark contrast to the constrained gestures her job required . <p> He reflected on his own days , their utter mindless monotony , and compared them to the summer after college , when divinity school lay ahead of him . Divinity school had been like a glass elevator that never stopped on any floor , but kept ascending to the greatest heights and descending to the lowest depths and never to any exits . But what had replaced it was a world without elevators , one sprawling single-story structure with no elevation or descent . <p> But Marla had n't fully arrived in this structure . She had a certain drive , a willfulness , and he admired it , coveted it , even , and at the same time , felt a desire to crush it that had strange sexual overtones . He debated whether his teasing of her was wrong . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid , his family had always said a long grace before dinner , and though he had found it excruciating , it did  --  he had to admit  --  increase his enjoyment of the meal once it finally started . And divinity school was the ultimate tantalization  --  his gaze focused intently on something he would never see . So , he thought to himself , what was wrong with being the tantalizer for a change ? Anyway , he rationalized , it was just a game . <p> The content of their exchanges slowly evolved . The candy bars were supplemented with gum and other small presents , though it was always something sweet . It was their little secret . She complained to him about not being able to get up from her spot at the switchboard  --  " I have no mobility , " was how she put it  --  and he asked her questions about growing up in Texas , about opera ; he liked listening to her voice . <p> Her one opportunity for " mobility " came when she made one of several trips during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refill her plastic Evian bottle with water from the kitchen tap . She tended to use the same bottle for a week at a time , and by the end of the first day , her red lipstick would have tinted the nozzle . For the rest of the week , it sat next to her , its tip bright pink . <p> Her trip to the kitchen took her past the room where Will and Hoffman worked opposite each other . Will always attempted to look deeply engrossed when she came by . He did n't want Hoffman witnessing their interactions , and also , he liked the idea that what he was doing seemed important . <p> " You drink a lot of water , " he said one day when she returned with a full bottle . Hoffman had stepped away from the desk . She paused next to him . It was the first time she had been standing while he was sitting . <p> " I 'd rather be drinking gin and tonics , " she said . She wore that imperious , **27;415;TOOLONG expression he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink , " he said . <p> " We 'll have to have one together sometime . " As she said this , she casually reached over and stroked Will 's hair and part of his neck . It was a mixture of a loving caress and the kind of tousling one gives to a little boy after he 's done a good deed . He leaned into it a little , and his eyes took a slow reflexive blink of pleasure , like a cat being petted . <p> Their eyes met , and Will smiled nervously . He 'd never really considered being with her in the real world . The office was an artificial bubble within which they could have their flirtation , and even that was mostly restricted to the transient space of the reception area . If he saw her outside this rigid context , all the rules would change . Everything would be out in the open , beyond his control . They would be together by choice , her presence next to him announcing a conscious sexual preference . He saw himself at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps someone from the office . And then , as if to demonstrate what it would be like , Hoffman returned with an amused look on his face . Will stared at him , preparing to hate him if he said something snide , but as soon as she walked away , Hoffman put a large envelope on the desk and removed its contents with the ginger care of a man defusing a bomb . <p> " I just got the logo design for my newsletter . What do you think ? " <p> He held up a piece of glossy paper . <p> " The Nondestructive Tester , " Will said out loud . <p> " Well ? " <p> " It has a nice ring to it . The Nondestuctive Tester . Could be a newsletter for high school teachers specializing in very nervous students . " <p> " I think it speaks right to the client , right to the people who are doing the testing , who are going to want to know the information we provide . " <p> Hoffman 's eyes began to shine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously a speech he was preparing . Will pictured him standing in front of an easel , pointer in hand , making a presentation . The attending businessmen would look at his charts with glazed eyes and then at him , thinking , " How the hell does that guy get his tie to dimple so perfectly ? " There was something charming about Hoffman 's secret plans . He was like a prisoner unfurling the blueprints of the jail . <p> " Tester , " said Will , musing . " Tester . Sounds a bit like testicle . The Nondestructive Testicle : A Newsletter for Today 's Compassionate Man . " <p> Hoffman glared at him and put the secret plans back in their envelope , where they would be retrieved when the time was right . <p> Shortly after Marla 's proposition , Will began to withdraw . It was an impulsive reaction . He did not want this experiment to leave the realm of the hypothetical . He felt it was a deficiency in his personality , like someone who constantly goes to enormous lengths to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water , but he did not question it . He survived his job on the premise that it was temporary ; to involve himself with Marla would make it part of his life . <p> First the candy bars stopped , then the idle banter at the reception area , and finally he began to avoid her glances altogether . Marla reacted to each new development like a dancer who steps forward each time her partner steps away . Her voice was as smooth and rich as ever , but it began to be inflected with recrimination . She could pack the phrase " Good morning , Will " with enough information to make his hands moist . He felt the sting of her disappointment but could think of no course of action other than to hide from it . He occasionally caught her in an expression of wistfulness and felt that he had joined the enormous ranks of people in the world who did n't appreciate her . But his sympathetic feelings were entirely internal , and now he marched past her to the bathroom with hardly a nod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convulsions of masturbatory pleasure , with her as the subject . <p> Then one day Marla walked passed his desk and dropped a chocolate bar on it . " Returning the favor , " she said , and then walked away . <p> When the phone rang , Will was in his underwear and socks , pacing around the living room with a gin and tonic . Rock music blared in the background ; his work clothes lay crumpled in a chair . This was one of his primary forms of entertainment , having a drink by himself and playing music . It was early in the evening , and he was slightly drunk . <p> " Will ? " Marla 's voice wafted over the phone into his ear . It had been nearly two months since she had started working at his company and several weeks since they had stopped talking . He cocked his head , paused , looked around his apartment . He did n't want to answer . There was something gross about her voice intruding into his home . Her voice was the official voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? It 's Marla . I 'm down at this bar . " <p> " Hold on , " said Will , and went to turn the music off . " You 're at a bar , " he said when he returned . <p> " Yes . Just a few blocks away from you , as a matter of fact <p> " How did you find out where I live ? " <p> " I have my ways . " Her voice slurred a little , its Texas accent more pronounced than usual . " Would you like to come join me ? " <p> A picture of her sitting alone at a bar came to him . He imagined what sort of man would try to pick her up . He wondered if this was something she did often , go to bars and get drunk by herself . Half of him wanted to run over and rescue her from what he was picturing , and the other half wanted to slam the phone down in its cradle . <p> " Why do n't you come over here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to retract it , but it was too late . He listened to her words fly over the phone . " I 've got some gin , some tonic ... " Happy bar sounds gurgled over the phone like a running tap , but Marla was silent . " Some lime . " <p> " Oh , well , if you have lime ... " <p> She said she would be there in ten minutes . <p> Will put the phone down and stood still for a few moments . <p> " You 're crazy , " he announced to no one , and then without missing a beat , he frantically began to run around the room cleaning up . Tiny gold beads no bigger than a ball bearing were scattered around his apartment , the strange legacy of Liza 's last visit , when her necklace broke . He kept thinking he had found the last one , and then another would pop up . He saw one now , glimmering in the corner , and picked it up to examine it . It was like a germ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her faintly disapproving manner , the way that their sex life had , after an auspicious beginning , made a slow steady retreat into propriety and then nonexistence . But this was part of his past . He was free of it now , and with his newfound liberty , he decided to do something extravagant and perverse . He was going to buy a chocolate cake . He was going to make Marla take off all her clothes and sit at the kitchen table with a napkin around her neck like a bib . It would come down to the tops of her breasts . Her nipples would bob in and out of sight , and he would feed her chocolate cake with his hands . <p> He put on his pants and was halfway out the door when he glimpsed his apartment in its disheveled state and was suddenly gripped with the desire to make it nice for Marla . He went back to neatening up . <p> The doorbell made him jump . He opened the door , and she stood in the doorway , and for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same outfit she had worn at work that day , a light green skirt and a black long-sleeve shirt with large fake emeralds  --  blue , green , and red  --  sewn in around the neck . She stepped inside amidst an invisible cloud of fragrance , what seemed like an entire display counter 's worth of perfume . <p> " It 's nice , " she said , looking around and taking a deep breath , as though she 'd just completed a long trip . " So much room ! " <p> " Really ? You must live in a closet . " <p> " I do , " she said . " And with a roommate . " <p> Will had planned to escort Marla to the kitchen table , but Marla took matters into her own hands and walked over to the couch , which was old and in bad shape and which made a painful groaning sound when she sank into it . <p> Will stood nervously , as though he were a maitre d ' about to apologize for some terrible mistake . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never showed up , " she said . " Are n't you going to make me a drink ? " <p> Will slowly emerged from the shock of seeing Marla on his couch . <p> " Yes , yes , of course . Gin and tonic , with lime . I have ice . " As he turned to go to the kitchen , he thought he glimpsed a slight expression of anxiety on Marla 's face . This was hard for her , too , he thought , especially hard for her ; she was in a strange person 's house who had n't been very dear about his intentions and who might even turn out to be unpleasant . Christ , he thought , we 're both human beings . Why is it so hard to treat someone like a human being ? Thinking these thoughts , he made the drinks , and as he returned to the living room , he realized he had talked himself out of even the slightest drop of sexual desire . <p> She was on the couch , her large shapely body folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thighs , which were covered with dark nylons . She looked anxious and helpless , and he found this attractive . <p> " Here , " he said , handing her a drink . <p> He eyed the spot next to her on the couch and then opted for the relative safety of a chair next to it . <p> " So , " he said . <p> " Well , " said Marla . " Your place is very nice . " <p> " I did n't get a chance to clean it up or anything . Usually when I have company ... " <p> " No , it 's nice . Besides , you did n't really have much warning . " She gave Will a polite smile which was open to several thousand possible interpretations . She twirled her glass around , and the ice cubes clinked merrily . This gesture seemed very well-rehearsed , and for a moment she seemed completely composed , even powerful , like a television executive whose show was riding high on the charts . <p> Will gulped his drink . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Does it bother you ? " she said . " I could just go . " <p> " No , it does n't bother me . It 's just weird . I mean , I 'm used to seeing you at work . It 's like I only know you in that context . " <p> " Well , I do n't like that context very much . It 's just so boring . You 're sick of it , too . " <p> " I arrived there sick of it , and it 's been getting worse every day , " he said . " It got a little better when you showed up , though . " <p> She smiled a shy flattered smile , which made Will think about what she was like growing up , before she acquired the glowing feminine presence she now had . He wondered if her classmates made fun of her , if she had breasts when she was ten , if she was teased . She probably could n't have been a cheerleader . He pictured her wearing one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down out of time with the other cheerleaders , her pompons flying up and hitting her in the face . <p> " Were you a cheerleader ? " he ventured . " You know , when you were in high school ? " <p> " That 's a strange question , Will . Why ? Do I act like a cheerleader ? " <p> " No , no , it 's just , you know , Texas , high school football ... " <p> " No , I was n't a cheerleader , " she sipped her drink . " I was in the marching band . " <p> " Oh . Sort of a big jump from that to opera . " <p> " My life is full of big jumps , " she said . <p> " I 'm glad you jumped to New York . " <p> He leaned toward her , gulped his drink , and raked her body with his eyes . <p> Marla saw this and shifted her drink from one hand to the other . Her eyes narrowed but then opened , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was nice having you as one of my early friends . And <p> do emphasize early , since you seem to have lost your enthusiasm for it lately . " <p> " I have ? " said Will defensively . " What do you mean ? " <p> " What do I mean ? " she said with some volume . <p> It dawned on Will that maybe she had come over to yell at him . He sat back in his chair . <p> " What do I mean ? " she repeated . " I mean that one day you 're buying me candy and hanging around and talking to me and the next day it 's like I just offended your mother or something and you can hardly look at me . " <p> " You did n't offend my mother , " said Will , retreating into the literal as a defense . <p> " I know damn well I did n't offend your mother ! So what did I do to make you so hostile all of a sudden ? " <p> " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Marla looked at him with exasperation . " Do n't avoid the subject . " <p> " What was the subject again ? My mother ? " <p> " Will ! " <p> " Oh , was it your mother ? " <p> " Will ! Come on . " Her voice softened a little and became small . " What did I do ? " <p> " Well , you 're here now , so what does it matter ? " He stood up . " I need another drink . Can I get you one ? " <p> She handed him her glass without saying anything . <p> When he returned he eyed the spot next to her on the couch but then returned to his chair . <p> " We do n't even know each other , " he said . " All I know about you is that you 're from Austin and that you study opera and that you 're going to be an opera diva or something . I do n't even know much about opera . And you know even less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in a stupid office . You do n't even know if I 'm the president or some schlemiel in the back room . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " said Marla , " but it 's very obvious that you 're a schlemiel in the back room . " <p> He was amazed at how hurt he was by the statement of this simple fact , but he decided to ignore it . <p> " For all you know , I could be a psychotic killer . I could be a pervert . You know how it is , the guys walking around in ties and suits all day being polite , they have years of accumulated weirdness inside of them waiting to explode . " <p> " Do n't flatter yourself . There 's not much killer in you . As for being a pervert ... " She paused , as though it was n't out of the question . <p> " I could be a poet , for all you know , " he said , as if this was an even more horrifying prospect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facetiously . <p> Will stared at her face . The coffee stain birthmark throbbed just beneath her temple . He had n't considered the possibility that she could be cruel , too , and its possibility interested him . He spoke calmly . " What do you think is going on with me , anyway ? Do you think I want to be mean to you ? " <p> " No , Will , " she said , quite softly . " I think you 're nice . You probably think you 're less nice than you really are . You probably like the idea of it . But you are nice . I just do n't know why you stopped being nice to me . " <p> Her insight was true , and in telling the truth , she had exerted a form of power to which Will had no immediate response . He had made one tiny little experiment , a minor test , and the destruction was running rampant . It was out of his control . He tried to form <p> sentence but could n't . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other options had been exhausted  --  he lurched forward and pressed his lips against Marla 's . They were warm and slippery with gin and lipstick , parted in surprise , soft and warm against his hard aggressive mouth . <p> She pulled back instinctively and pressed her hand against his chest , then relented a little , and his tongue found its way into her mouth for an awkward moment . Will remembered the confused look of concentration he had seen on her face that first day , with her full lips parted dumbly , and imagining that her face now had that same expression sent a surge of excitement through him . She pulled away just as he lunged forward in his desire , groping at her , and in one frantic moment , everything slipped away from him , including his drink , which landed right in the middle of her lap . <p> " Will ! " she screamed . <p> " Oh shit , " he said , referring as much to his unexpected gesture as to the stain that stretched from her waist nearly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grayish green fabric . <p> " Will ! " she screamed again . " What 's the matter with you ? " She looked at him with wide incredulous eyes . " Go get me a towel , for Christ 's sake ! " <p> Will jumped off the couch and ran to the kitchen , returning with a clump of paper towels dangling from his outstretched arm like a bouquet of flowers . <p> " Here , " he said . He watched as she attended to the wet spot with urgent , fussy energy . He stood over her for a moment and then , feeling silly standing there , started pacing the room in <p> circle . <p> " What 's the matter with you ? " said Marla again . " Do n't they train men in New York ? Does someone take you out for a walk on a leash when you get home from work ? " <p> She seems upset , thought Will . " God , " he said sarcastically . " It 's not that big a deal . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bowl on the floor , " she went on . Her head was down , and he thought he heard her voice crack . " You probably sleep on a pillow in a big wicker basket . You probably  --  " <p> " I did n't mean it , " he said . <p> " I know just what you 're thinking . " Her voice lowered . She looked at him with narrow eyes . " Do you think this is news to me ? You think you 're a novelty ? With your nervous stares , your little games . " <p> " Oh shit , " said Will , and he went into the bathroom , where he spent several minutes washing his face with cold water . <p> " I 'm sorry about that , " he said when he came out . " I 'm just a little drunk . " <p> " You 're behaving awfully , " she said . She was standing now , inspecting her skirt . <p> " You were the one who wanted to come over , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid trying to get out of the blame for something . He did n't understand why he kept acting like a thirteen-year-old with this woman . <p> " Actually , I accepted your invitation . If you had said , ' Would you like to come over so I can maul you and spill my drink on you and then act unpleasantly ? ' I would have told you to fuck off . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " he said . <p> " Is this how you normally relate to women ? " <p> " No , " he said . " I do n't usually spill my drink on them And then , " I must admit , you have a strange effect on me . I do n't think I understand it . " <p> They were standing several feet apart , facing each other , their bodies slightly taut , as if they were in a martial arts class and one of them was about to execute a takedown . Just then Will glanced over at the window and noticed he had neglected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building , ridiculously close to his , its face a crossword puzzle of light and dark squares . He wondered if they had had an audience for the entire encounter , and he considered how the scene might have looked from a distance , viewed without sound , like a silent movie . <p> " Look , " he said , " we 've been performing . You like that , do n't you ? We 've had our own little tragedy . " <p> " More like a farce , " she said . <p> He walked over to the window and cupped his eyes against it so he could see out better . When he first moved into the apartment , he had been horrified at how available other people 's lives were to him , but after a while he grew to like it . He marveled at apartment buildings , at how lives could unfold in such proximity without ever touching . Just then he could see a woman peeling potatoes in her kitchen for what seemed like a large meal ; next to that , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flickering blue light of an unseen television . <p> " I do n't know what you 're doing , " said Marla , " but I 'm leaving . " <p> " Wait ! " said Will . " I 'm casing the joint . You have to know who you 're performing for . You 're going to be a diva , right ? A star . And stars love to perform . I 've never heard you sing . " <p> Marla looked at him with an irritated expression and picked up her purse . She took a few steps towards the door and turned to him , inhaled , and let out a single burst of sound , a single high note that elevated him off the floor for several seconds and then dropped him , weak-kneed , back on his feet . She walked out with an air of triumph , and let the door slam behind her . He stared at it for a long time , half expecting it to open again . When it did n't , he went and made himself another drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit his job . He smiled weakly at the thought of telling the vice president . He was quite shaken up . A stranger looking in from across the alley could have seen it on his face . <p>
