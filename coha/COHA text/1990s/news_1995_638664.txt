<p> The ' basics ' bunch wo n't let Littleton 's schools heal <p> As a Littleton voter , I 'd like to respond to Mike Rosen 's Sept. 15 column on the 1995 Littleton and Jeffco school board elections . While most of Rosen 's column grossly mischaracterized the situation in Littleton , I will agree with his observation that there will be two terms absent from this year 's election rhetoric : " liberal " and outcome-based education . The dominant concerns in the minds of Littleton voters this year will be management , money , maintenance of high quality , mending fences , and most of all moderation . <p> Littleton voters are worried about the degradation of the district 's reputation under the back-to-basics board majority 's management . We are worried about the degradation of property values that may follow . <p> The back-to-basics majority 's management problems have been glaring . After two years on their watch , there is no strategic plan and no board-approved action plan for the superintendent . There is not even any board-approved document or policy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though this concept was the cornerstone of their campaign . This might lead you to believe there is a lack of direction in the district , and you 'd be right . <p> The back-to-basics majority refused to attend to the financial security of the district until it was too late . Preferring instead to spend time consolidating political power , they ignored a $ 5.4 million revenue shortfall that resulted in the largest staff cut in the district 's history . <p> Let 's face it - it 's really hard to provide an education for our kids , traditional or otherwise , without teachers , and those who were not laid off are leaving in droves . Since January 1994 there has been a 20 percent turnover in teaching staff . This does not include the 10 percent layoff , and there has been another 40 percent turnover in administration . <p> We need to mend many fences in our district , but it has been an impossibility . Just when the community starts to heal , we are outraged by the conduct of back-to-basics board members . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conduct with impunity and playing politics when they should be planning our children 's education . <p> Rosen is wrong ; these are not the actions of moderates . To use Rosen 's analogy , these are the actions of people who would burn down our village in order to save it . <p> BARBARA KATZ <p> Littleton <p> City not ' backtracking ' on Broncos pact <p> Regarding your Sept. 11 editorial , " Broncos ' complaint against Denver , " in which you suggest that the city is " backtracking " in a way that fails to live up to our obligation to the Denver Broncos regarding the maintenance of Mile High Stadium , perhaps a better understanding of that obligation would be helpful . <p> The agreement between the city and the Broncos requires the city to " keep the stadium in good repair and safe condition . " You need not doubt that the city has fully complied with this provision and will certainly continue to do so . The fact that the city commissioned a study to provide city engineers with advice on ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Your complaint of " backtracking " seems to be that the city asked for the study to be more precisely focused upon the next 15 years , and that we have found ways to accomplish the same objectives perfectly well , but with less than the projected expenditure of taxpayer funds . I would have thought that this would have been something your newspaper supported . <p> DANIEL E. MUSE <p> Denver City Attorney <p> Public 's interest seems secondary in Jeffco <p> As a resident of the Rock Creek Ranch in Superior , I have been following the debate surrounding the proposed expansion of air service at Jefferson County Airport , and so I was drawn to the Sept. 17 " Letters . " <p> Robert Lesher may not realize it , but residents in the airport area are " intelligent enough to know there will be airplane noise " since we live near an airport . I believe that many of the people impacted by Jeffco are concerned with an increase in noise levels - an increase that has occurred since the opening of DIA and will further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The present increase is the direct result of overflights by aircraft either originating or arriving at DIA and by increased air traffic at Jeffco . <p> As for town meetings and input into the formulation of minimum standards , it would appear from statements made by the Jefferson County Commissioners and the Airport Authority that scheduled service is a fait accompli . Each of these entities takes the attitude that the other is responsible for the process and they are therefore powerless to halt or slow it . When all else fails , each blames it on the fact that Jeffco has received funds from the federal government and as a result is obligated to expand service . <p> Living nearby , I must confess it appears that Jeffco 's decision makers are falling all over themselves to make this airport appetizing for scheduled service at the expense of the thousands of people who live in proximity to it . Input from those most directly affected is given no weight . This must clearly be the case , since a reading of the proposed minimum standards shows a half-baked and flawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are apparently willing to sacrifice the welfare of their electorate and others for the economic benefit of the few . <p> IRA FUITONBERG <p> Superior <p> Has The Post imported some liberal bias ? <p> It appears that The Denver Post has decided there is n't enough local liberal bias in the paper , so some was imported from Chicago . <p> In a special section about middle-class job issues that ran in The Post September 15 , two Chicago Tribune reporters severely diminished their credibility virtually as soon as their report began . The reporters , R. C. Longworth and Sharman Stein , claim that the 1994 congressional Republican landslide was because voters were fed up with incumbency ! The fact is , not one Republican incumbent running for reelection for Congress in 1994 lost . Not one ! This amazing and almost unprecedented fact has received enormous publicity in the media , newspaper and TV both . Commentators , reporters and political consultants all over this country have endlessly analyzed and reported on this phenomenon . It is not conceivable that these two reporters are unaware of this fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as voters expressing their dissatisfaction with Democratic incumbency ! <p> One can only conclude Longworth and Stein have an agenda unrelated to giving information to readers , but rather to deny that voters are fed up with 40 years of Democrat-driven , intrusive , confiscatory governance . <p> LEE A. SELLERS <p> Northglenn <p> Those in glass houses <p> should n't throw stones <p> In response to the letters of Sept. 17 : Gregory Miehe opens his letter criticizing Joanne Ostrow for straying from her area of expertise - TV/radio - into politics . <p> I would expect as much coming from an advocate for a patriarchal religion such as Christianity . <p> And in his zeal to discredit Ostrow on her knowledge of television , Miehe states that she mistakenly accuses Channel 7 of running " stale Perry Mason movies " in the past . Mistakenly , I suppose , because he asserts that Perry Mason is an NBC property . Problem is , Perry Mason aired Sept. 16 ( and will air again Sept. 23 ) on Channel 7 , which is now an ABC affiliate and before that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his own area of expertise - whatever that may be . <p> JAMES McDONALD <p> Arvada <p> Tone down the crudeness ; <p> readers deserve better <p> Thanks for The Denver Post 's section in the Sept. 17 edition , " Passport to the Arts . " It will be helpful to those who would like to attend some of the fine entertainment offered in Denver . <p> But then you blew it with the article on page 8 : " Intimacy , " " More sex " and " How to increase the frequency . " <p> Why so blatant ? <p> Was this necessary ? Do n't your readers deserve better ? <p> That article and its captions were just plain crude . <p> MRS . WILLIAM E. WILLGING <p> Pueblo <p> Can someone explain <p> our government 's logic ? <p> I wish someone would explain : <p> Why our government subsidizes tobacco farmers yet preaches that smoking is hazardous to our health ( I am a nonsmoker ) . <p> Why the United States government borrows money from England , Germany and Japan , then sends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Why we sent delegates of women to the United Nations Fourth Conference on Women in China , a country where women have few rights ? <p> Does the conference expect to reform Chinese high officials ? <p> EDNA A.
