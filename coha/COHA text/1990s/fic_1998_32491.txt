The New Story of O BLUE MOON BOOKS , INC . Blue Moon Books , Inc . O was wearing , as usual , a tailored suit of grey silk . The hem of the pleated skirt swung against her stockinged shins . The scooped neckline of the jacket revealed a white linen blouse . Her only jewellery was a plain band of steel round the third finger of her left hand . She disdained underwear . Her stockings were held up with garters . Beneath her clothes , her breasts , her buttocks and her sex were naked . This had been her custom since the first time she had been delivered to Roissy by Rene R , her lover . With a leather handbag over her shoulder O was standing in wait near the revolving door of one of the tall glass structures that cluster at the outskirts of Paris : the structures in which businessmen fuel their expansionary dreams . The towers dominate the city as their inhabitants hope to dominate the world . It was the end of lunchtime , and the offices were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men turned to stare at O. That slim figure ; those pale green eyes ; those lips touched with just a hint of wine-dark lipstick ; she was provocative , that was clear at a glance , and all the more so because she seemed completely indifferent . O did n't go out of her way to please ; she did n't behave like the girls who flirt with you in the street , who seduce you with a silent look . O simply made herself available to everyone , as she had learnt to do in the rooms of Roissy ; it was a submissiveness that could be taken for insolence . Although she had previously seen him only in a secretly-taken photograph , she recognised the man she was waiting for among a group that was hurrying towards the lifts . He had black and slightly curly hair , and concealed his youthful looks behind tortoiseshell glasses . His light summer suit , like everyone else 's , was of beige flannel ; like everyone else he had one of the financial newspapers tucked under his arm . O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lifts , O slipped in with him and pressed the button to close the doors . They were alone together . O waited . The man began to feel uneasy . Unnecessarily , he adjusted the knot of his tie . O 's face was averted , her eyes downcast , as if she could n't look at him . ' Which floor are you going to ? ' he asked , in a somewhat strangled voice . ' To the top , ' O answered . The man started the lift and leant again one of its mirrored surfaces . O stayed where she was standing , at the other side of the cabin , straight and motionless . The man became aware of her scent : bitter woods and marshland herbs , a sharp and wild perfume . Luminous numbers indicating the passing floors flickered on the screen above the doors . ' Me too - I 'm going to the top floor , ' the man said . O made no reply . He wished she would give him just one look , just a glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lift takes fifty-two seconds to reach the top . And I 'm afraid that 's not enough . ' Then , as the young woman still said nothing , still looked away , he added : ' That 's not enough time for me to seduce you . ' O looked up at the screen . ' You have forty seconds left , ' she said . ' Forty seconds is useless . You must give me a bit longer than that . Have dinner with me tonight . ' ' That wo n't be necessary , ' O said . ' If you need more time , I 'll give it to you . ' She reached out and pressed the red button . The lift stopped . For the first time , O raised her pale green eyes to look into the man 's . ' There you are , ' she said . The man looked down at her with a worried gaze . ' What do you want ? ' he said . ' Nothing that you do n't want yourself , ' O replied ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards him , and parted his lips with her mouth . His tongue searched for hers but she pulled away , smiled , and moved her hand down to rest against his trousers . His manhood hardened against her palm . The man tried to push her away , but she tightened her grip . Her delicate fingers unbuckled his snakeskin belt ; she unbuttoned his trousers ; and took his organ in her hand . A bell started ringing : the alarm was programmed to go off whenever the lift was stopped between floors for more than twenty seconds . O parted her lips and brushed them along the man 's jawline . ' I had better start the lift again , ' she whispered . ' But I guarantee you 'll be satisfied before we reach the top . ' The man made no reply . The lift moved , and the ringing ceased . O enclosed the man 's stiff member in her hand and , keeping her body a little apart from his , she alternately pressed with her fingers and then released his flesh . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little beads of perspiration were forming in the valley between her breasts . Above the doors , the numbers continued their inexorable parade : thirty-two , thirty-four , thirty-six ... The man was breathing heavily . He closed his eyes , and was unable to hold back a moan . O clenched one hand round the shaft and fondled the purple crown with the other . The man sighed and tilted his head backwards . Thirty-eight , forty ... The top floor was approaching . He grabbed a rail : he was beginning to come , he could feel nothing but the young woman 's insistent fingers ; and then he felt only the gushing pleasure , the pulsing release of his orgasm . The lift stopped . The doors opened . O left , her bag swinging from her shoulder , giving no indication that anything unusual had occurred . The man was still trying to adjust his clothes when he was blinded by a flash of light . Of course - a photograph . He blundered out on to the landing to see who had trapped him ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identical carpeting led to identical closed doors . The young woman , too , had disappeared . The man shook his head ; he was angry about being caught in a trap , and even more furious that he had failed to hold on to the mysterious beauty whose hand had given him such precisely timed pleasure . As he recalled her manipulations he felt his groin begin to tingle again . He had known quite a few prostitutes ; but not one of them had been capable of combining such sweet dexterity with such an air of detachment . Her fingers had played on his instrument with a virtuoso 's skill ; but it was her haughtiness as she performed that obsessed him . The man sighed , adjusted his suit , and ran his fingers through his hair . Once again he looked like any other businessman as he made his way to the boardroom of the multinational conglomerate Capitol Industries . Chapter Two Whether it was winter or summer , Gina wore the same outfit : a black leather mini-skirt ; apple-green or cherry-red , tights ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cling to her breasts , the freckled slopes of which were always on display above her low-cut neckline . Gina was a secretary . She had realised at an early stage that neither her shorthand speed nor her command of languages would be the key to success in her career ; but her trick of brushing her bosom against the backs of the necks of the executives of Capitol Industries while handing over a file had gained her the attention of all of the senior managers as well as countless invitations to dinner . She refused each invitation in the same way : with a bored smile , a word or two of vague regret , and a hint that one of these days , probably , she might make herself available ; and each time the sighing supplicant would return to his office as happy as if his proposition had been accepted . No-one knew anything about Gina 's private life ; but hypotheses , suppositions and fantasies flourished at Capitol Industries . Victor Bergil , the Marketing Director , liked to picture his boss 's secretary living with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue Mozart . Gina 's mother , Bergil imagined , was a harridan who insisted that her daughter should return home each evening no later than eight o'clock ; and Gina 's only treat would be to accompany her mother on Saturday afternoons to an old-fashioned patisserie near the Trocadero where , amongst a circle of friends which diminished from year to year , the old lady recalled the ostentatious glories of the Third Republic . And of course Bergil fantasised about Gina 's solitary pleasures , the lonely activities that were all the girl had to enjoy once she had put her aged mother to bed and retired to her own bedroom . ' I can see her , ' Bergil would say , ' as if I were watching her through the keyhole . She is coming into the room ; she is bolting the door so she ca n't be disturbed . She stops in front of the mirror set in the mahogany wardrobe . She looks at her reflection for a long time ; and then , inch by inch , she starts to remove her T-shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is flat and smooth and freckled . She caresses the skin with her fingertips as if she were another woman , an inexpert lover exploring an unknown body . Then she stretches out the material and pulls it up to uncover the generous mounds of her bosom . She flattens her breasts with the palms of her hands , and I see her shiver slightly . Her fingers play with her nipples ; she cups her breasts in her hands and takes each nipple between a finger and a thumb , squeezing and twisting the hardening tips . She releases her breasts and undoes her skirt , which slides down her thighs . She rolls down her tights , stopping to tousle the long curls that can clearly be seen through the fine silk of her knickers ; and then she parts her thighs and , standing on one trembling leg at a time , she removes the red tights . She is now naked except for her white knickers ; one hand caresses the material where it is taut across her buttocks , while the other is imprisoned under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her lips are apart ; her eyes are almost closed , but not quite : she is still watching herself in the mirror , as if she were watching someone else , as if the reflected hand so rhythmically moving belonged to her lover . She does n't want to rush things ; it 's important not to come too soon . Her other hand is now inside her knickers , too , stroking her soft cheeks , circling closer and closer to the warm haven between her thighs . Her fingertips reach the place , they press , pinch , pull , and almost penetrate . Quickly now , and almost furtively , she removes the knickers . She parts the lips of her sex , and pushes in one finger , and then two . As she twists her body in order to see herself from every angle , her hand diasappears into her flesh . She starts to moan , faster and faster , in time with the thrusting of her fingers ; and finally she cries out from the depths of her soul . And with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with one hand still clutching the seat of her pleasure . ' This was what Victor Bergil used to say . His colleagues listened to him with tight throats and racing pulses . Only Moreau , the Director of Planning , remained sceptical . He had an alternative theory : he had convinced himself that Gina led a double life . By day she was a secretary ; but at night he imagined her a fashionable prostitute , gliding along the Avenue Foch and round the Place de l'Etoile at the wheel of a white Mercedes . To Moreau , it was an obvious transformation : she did n't even need to change her clothing , except to remove her conspicuous tights and thus expose her rounded thighs in an invitation that nobody could resist . And so that day , as Gina was distributing papers to the men sitting round the table in the air-conditioned boardroom , Gilles Moreau caught her wrist in his hand . ' Well then , Gina : how much ? ' The girl decided to misunderstand the question ; pushing her breasts in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a column of figures . ' The usual , monsieur , as you can see . ' Bergil , jealous of his colleague 's audacity , quickly intervened : ' I have to ask myself whether these papers serve any purpose . They always contain much the same information . ' There was a general murmur of agreement . At Capitol Industries lengthy meetings which meandered round every topic were neither unusual nor taken seriously . Gina freed her arm from Moreau 's grip and said , drily : ' I was told by Monsieur Botterweg to give the files to you . And I have to do as he tells me . ' Moreau hefted the bundle of documents , and sighed . Victor Bergil could n't take his eyes off Gina 's T-shirt . He could picture her breasts : full and firm and heavy , with a sprinkling of freckles , and tipped with thick brown nipples . He imagined enfolding those breasts in his hands ; squeezing them , licking them , sucking them ; sliding his throbbing member up and down between them . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sharp voice of Bernard Vielle , the young scion of an old family , who had joined the company through the old boy network . ' The only purpose of all this paperwork is to convince us that Botterweg earns his salary . If it were n't for the endless bumph we might start asking what it is he actually does with his time . ' Bergil jumped , almost as if he really had been caught fondling Gina 's breasts . ' This time , I think you 'll find things are rather different . One of these files is sealed , and marked Top Secret . ' Gina graced him with a mischievous smile . Bergil would no doubt have relapsed into one of his dreams about her had he not been interrupted by Gilles Moreau 's contemptuous laugh . ' Daniel Botterweg likes nothing better than cloaking his actions in mystery , ' he said . ' But I 'll tell you something else , and unfortunately it 's not " top secret " : Pembroke is coming to France . And he 's coming to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'll gobble up Capitol Industries - and spit us out . ' ' You worry too much , ' Bergil replied . ' Pembroke Senior was the big man , the real Pembroke ; and he died five years ago . Against him we would n't have stood a snowflake 's chance in hell . But we 're dealing with his son ; that gives us at least some hope . ' ' From what I 've heard , the son is at least as formidable as his father , ' Moreau grumbled ; and then the door opened , and everyone fell silent . The man who strolled in had had time to recover his dignity . His face had resumed the expression of a decision-maker , and revealed no hint of his pre-occupations or of his encounter with O. Gina scurried forward to hold the door for him , but he did n't reward her with his customary appreciative glance . He threw his papers on to the conference table . Gina pouted . ' Everyone is present , sir , ' she said . ' So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henri Carel . Henri Carel was the Chairman and Managing Director of Capitol Industries .
