One fine day in 1972 , an assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts drove to the city dump in Rockland , Mass. , took 14 bulky typescripts out of his car and heaved them as far as he could into the trash . " I waited till the bulldozer came by and buried them , " said George V. Higgins recently , recalling the scene with satisfaction . " And then I left . " <P> So far , Higgins ' first 14 novels have not risen from Rockland 's slime to shame their creator . Most of them , he says , had shamed him already , by collecting thumbprints and rejection letters from virtually all the reputable publishing houses in New York City and Boston . What gave him the courage to deep-six such a large shelf of certifiably lame literature , however , was an acceptance . The Friends of Eddie Coyle , a gritty , amiably cynical tale about barroom lowlifes and courthouse small-timers in Massachusetts , had been bought by Knopf . Higgins prepared , at last , for overnight success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade . Reviewers loved the novel . But Eddie Coyle never moved higher than fifth on the New York Times best-seller list , and in 12 months sold fewer than 25,000 copies . Failure ? No , success ; most first novels are n't reviewed at all , and most well-reviewed novels do n't sell 25,000 hard-cover copies . <P> Higgins , 51 , grouched cheerfully about such matters over an easeful lunch in what must no longer be called the men 's bar at Locke-Ober , hard by the Boston Common . Books , as distinct from best sellers , just are n't thought important , he says . He notes with disgust that even in the most literate city in North America ( that 's Boston ) , the leading paper ( the Globe , though he deplores its preachiness ) barely bothers to scrape together a Sunday book-review section . And justifies this lapse ( says Higgins , a onetime Globe columnist ) because it does n't get enough book ads . " Does the Globe 's sports section get enough ads for baseball gloves and hockey sticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow + tires . Do n't book readers use snow tires ? " <P> Higgins did well enough in the good-writing dodge , however  --  a fair-sized following watches the bookstores and grabs whatever he writes on the first bounce  --  to be able to quit his assistant U.S. Attorney post in 1973 , and eventually to leave off the practice of law altogether . That year he published a superb second novel ( 16th , counting those in the Rockland dump ) called The Digger 's Game . If somebody is n't teaching this small marvel in writing classes , then U.S. education is in worse shape than we have been told . Probably not , though ; there is an indictable villainy or two in the plot , and Higgins is pigeonholed , wrongly but irretrievably , as a crime novelist .
