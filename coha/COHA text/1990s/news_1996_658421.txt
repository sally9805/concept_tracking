<p> " Doors have opened for me since I came here , " says Lance Wade , an art student at New Orleans Center for Creative Arts ( NOCCA ) . His paintings , including one that portrays a friend who was murdered , have won state-wide prizes . <p> " NOCCA did n't just give me the opportunity to learn what I wanted to learn about art , " Lance notes . " It gave me the opportunity to want more , so I can do something when I finish here . " <p> Established in 1974 , NOCCA is a public high school that provides intensive training in dance , music , visual arts , theater , and writing . The school is a success story , not just for individual students like Lance , but for the beleaguered New Orleans public school system , which generally ranks near the bottom by many measures of academic achievement . <p> By contrast , NOCCA students - 17 percent of whom are on public assistance - boast sterling statistics like a 97 percent daily attendance rate , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , approximately three-quarters of them on scholarship . <p> For a small school ( 250 students , including a senior class of about 50 ) in a dilapidated , 95-year-old building , NOCCA grads have snagged a surprising haul of national awards , like presidential scholarships , Academy of American Poetry awards , and NEA and NEH fellowships . It is such a bright spot amid the blight of crime and poverty in the city , that the Louisiana legislature is chipping in $ 17.5 million to construct a new facility , slated for groundbreaking in June . <p> High-profile alumni <p> Of the 180 members of the International Network of Performing and Visual Arts Schools , NOCCA probably has the most national visibility , primarily because many alumni have high-voltage jazz careers . Termed the " young lions " in a Time magazine cover story , the celebrity alums include trumpeter Wynton Marsalis , winner of eight Grammys and artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York , and his brothers : sax player Branford ( until recently , music director of " The Tonight Show " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among many other NOCCA musicians with major recording careers are Grammy-winning pianist and actor Harry Connick Jr . and trumpet player Terence Blanchard , who has composed scores for Spike Lee films . <p> Graduates in other fields also lend glory to the school , as dancers perform with companies like the Dutch National Ballet and Atlanta Ballet . Writers publish books , film criticism , and poetry . Visual-arts graduates are architects , designers , and painters exhibiting in galleries . Actor Wendell Pierce , who appeared on Broadway in August Wilson 's Pulitzer Prize-winning " The Piano Lesson " and has a major role in the film " Waiting to Exhale , " studied at NOCCA . " No other school in such a short time has produced so many artists who are not only successful , but who 've actually changed the course of their craft , " he says . <p> Yet , although the school has produced more than its share of stars , " that 's not what NOCCA 's about , " says music chairman Stephen Dankner . " It 's an enrichment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career in the arts . " Singing instructor Lorraine Alfaro cites the case of a vocal student who decided to pursue medicine rather than music . " This is a success story for us . If a student can find out in high school what she wants , we 've done a tremendous service . " <p> Student painter Madeleine Froomer is under no illusion that stardom awaits . " The role of an artist in society is nothing society will reward , " she says . " You do it for yourself and to express what you ca n't express otherwise . " <p> Many students still audition for admission to NOCCA , however , dazzled by the " Fame " mystique . " Fame " was a 1980 movie that spun off a 1982-83 television series based on New York 's High School for the Performing Arts , the first arts magnet school founded in 1936 . " A lot of people come here because they 're intoxicated with the NOCCA image and think we will make them a star , " says drama teacher Henry Hoffman . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet to the fire on academics . They must see the connection between literacy and art . " <p> The New Orleans model differs from most arts magnet schools , which offer academic and arts classes in one building . NOCCA enrollees take academic courses at nearly 50 schools in the metropolitan area , then attend NOCCA half a day for arts training . Yet the choice offered students is not art or academics but art and academics , since they must maintain a B average . " It 's not a goof-off place , " says dancer Sara Howland . " You come here to be serious . " <p> Sometimes students throw themselves so hard into training that academic grades nosedive . That 's when individual attention from teachers pays off . " When the teachers find out your grades are slipping and they realize the talent you have , they push you , " says Collette Williams , a dancer . " It 's hard to balance the art and academics because you got the creative vibe going , but you 've got to get the intellectual side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts <p> In fact , the discipline necessary for a pre-professional arts curriculum seeps over to the 3-R side . Many students ' grades climb after enrolling at NOCCA , despite the extra demands on their time . " Art , schmart , " says Mr. Hoffman . " If anything , they learn the work ethic here . " <p> Teachers say one problem apprentice artists face is their urge to perform before mastering the basics . " The main thing at first is to hold them back , " says jazz teacher Clyde Kerr Jr . Fundamentals of instruction include not only technique but studying the classical literature , music theory , and ear training . " They 're cheeky and they want to play at clubs . We teach how to be a wallflower at the orgy . I tell them , ' You have to bring something on stage , ' " Mr. Kerr says . <p> At an age when most teens are more concerned about their next date than their ultimate fate , these young people exhibit striking maturity . As vocalist Carmen White observes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like what to wear to a party , while I 'm worried about my future career . " She adds , " It seems like you lose a lot by going here , but actually you gain a lot . You find out who you are and what 's important to you . " Although Carmen sacrificed participating in activities like student council at her academic school , her training in Italian bel canto singing taught her , she says , " new skills , which you 're doing instead of just reading about . " <p> Active rather than passive learning is key to the program 's success . The differences are " enormous " between students ' academic schools and NOCCA , says acting student Tristan Codrescu , son of poet and National Public Radio essayist Andrei Codrescu . " At my other school they teach people how to be robots . Everyone has these glazed eyes as they march toward their next class and sit in their seats . Here you 're blasted into a new world . In movement class you 're rolling on the floor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " <p> Theater department head Raymond Vrazel says , " Any academic school could adopt the methods of an arts school and have great , great results . " Yet teaching at NOCCA puts a heavy burden on instructors . For one thing , all faculty are practicing professionals in their fields . <p> " We 're not coming from a little red schoolhouse , apple-on-the-desk background , " Hoffman says . " We 've been bumped around , and we tool our students to that reality . " <p> Treated like professionals <p> Not only do teachers serve as mentors and role models , but the technical skills they transmit have practical relevance . It 's learning for life , not for a grade , and students say they love it . According to NOCCA principal John Otis , who is president of the International Network of Performing and Visual Arts Schools , " The arts can serve as a model because of our emphasis on authentic learning , as in John Dewey 's motto - learn by doing . " <p> Although capable of spellbinding performances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just when you think you have it mastered , you 're really nowhere , " says drama student Richon May . " But you can learn the most from your failures anyway . " <p> Teachers treat their charges not just like adults , but like professionals . Students become very results-oriented and independent . As writer Dolsy Smith says , " We have to explore and search for our own answers here . I 've learned how to think more than just how to write . " <p> Many students find fellowship by working with like-minded peers , whom they come to consider family . " At my regular school , people think I 'm so weird and crazy , but here I 'm just like everyone else , " says Richon . <p> Although they come from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds , NOCCA students discover common ground in the arts . Inner-city public school enrollment in New Orleans is less than 4 percent white , while at NOCCA student enrollment is 50/50 white/non-white . " Inside these walls , " Vrazel says , " is a truly multicultural approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the races and different cultures come together . " <p> " NOCCA is a microcosm of how our society works , " agrees Kenneth Ferdinand , executive director of Friends of NOCCA , a nonprofit group that has raised $ 3 million to furnish the new school building . Citing New Orleans 's rich heritage of multiethnic music , cuisine , and architecture , he adds , " Here , we 're steeped in diversity and art . " <p> Redefining local culture <p> With music grads in the vanguard , NOCCA has already redefined the culture of New Orleans . Just three decades ago , about the only place to hear authentic jazz was at Preservation Hall where octogenarian musicians played " When the Saints Go Marching In " for $ 5 tips . Now jazz wafts from every street corner like the scent of magnolias . School officials are hoping the other arts will be as highly appreciated . <p> Between 10th and 12th grades , classes shrink drastically as pupils who lack a true calling exit the program . A two-week decision period after a student is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw or be " counseled out , " a euphemism for returning to regular school . Teachers and counselors meet with students each semester to decide if they 've progressed enough to stay . <p> " It 's really all in students ' hands , " says the theater department 's Vrazel . <p> Many of those who stick it out find , as Harry Connick Jr . says of his NOCCA education , " The teachers put the tool belt on me , gave me a hammer and nails . They gave me everything I needed to build what I had to do . " <p> 2,3 ) HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE : Briana Williams ( class of ' 95 ) and student Campbell Perkinson at the piano in jazz class ( left ) .
