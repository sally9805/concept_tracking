<p> John P. Hewko , formerly of Arlington , Va. , may be the only attorney associated with the law firm of Baker &; McKenzie who , with his wife , prepares dinner parties on a hot plate . He is probably the only one in his law firm who then washes the dishes in his bathtub . <p> And almost certainly he alone views Moscow as a shopping paradise , which he and his wife Margarita visit once every five weeks for canned goods and bottled water unavailable in Ukraine . They now call this newly independent country home . <p> But for Hewko , 34 , assisting in the rebirth of the country that his father fled in a horse-drawn wagon 48 years ago more than compensates for any hardships . <p> " I love it . It 's the thrill of a lifetime , " Hewko said recently , after spending the past nine months helping draft a new constitution as well as new laws on privatization , corporations , foreign investment , antitrust and parliamentary procedure . " They 're building a country from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union , Americans and Canadians are returning to the places of their birth or ancestry to find long-buried roots and help bring about the transition from communism to democracy . <p> Many of the foreigners now descending on Moscow stay at luxury hotels , dispense advice for a few days and go home . But a hardier band of pioneers are , for a time at least , calling these struggling new countries home . The spokeswoman for the government of Lithuania , the foreign minister of Armenia , a top economic adviser in Kazakhstan  --  all are Americans on loan to this fragile experiment in peaceful revolution . <p> To the countries involved , the Americans bring experience in democracy and business , contacts in the West , savvy in dealing with the international press and , sometimes most importantly , tangible proof of overseas support . They are , in many ways , like latter-day John Reeds , but with very different politics from the American Communist whose experiences during the Bolshevik Revolution were chronicled in the book " Ten Days That Shook the World " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe the chance to be present at the creation justifies most hardships  --  scarce food , less-than-glamorous apartments , frequently broken telephones , even families left behind . <p> For the first few pioneers in Ukraine , there is a special satisfaction in visiting relatives and villages long closed to them  --  and in seeing the emergence of a nation of 52 million that the West long shrugged off as not a nation at all . <p> " I was just dismissed in college : ' Of course you 're anti-communist , but we WASPS , who have read about it , can be objective , ' " recalled Hewko , a graduate of Hamilton College , Harvard Law School and Oxford University whose lawyerly suspenders , conservative tie and striped shirt make no concession to the absence of dry cleaners in Kiev . " Now Ukrainians finally have a chance to have the world recognize who they are . " <p> Washingtonian Irene Jarosewich , 34 , who forsook her Adams-Morgan apartment and Capitol Hill job last June to work here for the independence movement Rukh , said she " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " when Ukraine voted for independence Dec. 1 . <p> But proud is not how Jarosewich , an exuberant and fast-talking second-generation American , would have described herself one afternoon last summer in the comically misnamed " Cafe Paris . " <p> She and two companions had traveled to the hot , polluted , southern Ukrainian city of Zaporozhye and were hoping for a drink and a snack . The cafe required its patrons to line up to buy juice , then line up again to buy snacks , and line up yet again for sweet pastries . " At that point , I 'd been here a month , I 'd stopped asking silly questions like , ' Why not just have one line ? ' " she said . <p> But when her companion reached the front of the drink line after a long wait only to be told that no glasses were available  --  and when Jarosewich surveyed the grimy cafe and saw at least 100 dirty glasses lying about  --  " I just snapped , " she said . <p> " I said fine , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasped and employees berated her , she marched into the kitchen , washed three glasses and drank her juice . <p> For her , the incident typified the most depressing aspect of life here  --  not the crumbling economy , but a beaten-down mentality . " People are wonderful here , but the intrinsic fear in people  --  they just do n't have the self-confidence most Westerners take for granted , " said Jarosewich , who attended Springbrook High School in Montgomery County and Ukrainian Saturday school in Silver Spring . <p> " Here , so much is working against you , and so much is not your fault that people do n't expect things to be done well . . . . This was a system of deprivation  --  economic , political , material , religious , spiritual . " <p> Margarita Hewko discovered the depth of material deprivation one day when she ventured into the maid 's room in their hotel and discovered an empty corn flakes box the Hewkos had discarded . The maid was proudly displaying the brightly colored empty box on a shelf , as art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Ukrainian acquaintances . <p> Besides such stories , the Americans and Canadians here are reluctant to complain about their own deprivation . Yet , by Western standards , life is not easy . Kiev does not have Moscow 's network of " dollar , " or hard-currency , stores for foreigners , and , aside from the most basic foods , it can be impossible to buy such common items as aspirin , nail clippers , beer , matches , water , magazines , butter , lettuce , cheese , fruit . <p> The godfather of the embryonic foreign community here is 65-year-old Bohdan Hawrylyshyn . A Ukrainian dragooned into a Nazi labor camp at age 17 , Hawrylyshyn entered Canada as a lumberjack , put himself through college and , eventually , became director of the International Management Institute of Lausanne . His mother stayed behind to wait for an older brother whom the Communists had arrested in 1940 ; she died without seeing either son again , and only in 1988 did Bohdan learn that his brother had died on the way to Siberia . <p> Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the business school in Kiev , " not because it was the most important thing to do , but because it was possible . I wanted to demonstrate that you could do something here . " Now he heads the Renaissance Foundation , which helps pay the salaries of Hewko , Boston banker George H. Yurchyshyn and soon , it is hoped , a number of other foreign experts . <p> " Instead of having people drop from a parachute , offer some good advice and disappear , we need people who will spend a year or two , " said Hawrylyshyn , whose white mustache and lined face bring to mind a frailer and somewhat more elegant Albert Einstein . <p> When things begin to go wrong on the path to capitalism , Hawrylyshyn added , the temptation for Ukraine 's bureaucrats " will be to slip back to the ways they know . " Foreigners like Hewko and Yurchyshyn can act as " backstops , " he said . <p> For the foreigners  --  especially the few , like Hewko and Jarosewich , who came when independence seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build a country that has existed more in imagination than on maps for centuries . <p> " As kids , you constantly had this Ukrainian language jammed down your throat , at home , at Saturday school  --  it became a real burden , " Hewko recalled recently . " Why do I need this if I 'm never going to use it ? " <p> And Hewko 's first trip to Ukraine , in 1975 , only confirmed that feeling , since the Soviet leadership had managed to substitute the Russian language in almost all public discourse . " Nobody spoke Ukrainian then , " he said . " I went around speaking Ukrainian , and it was like I was a wacko from space . . . . I was convinced Ukrainian would be dead in a couple of years . " <p> Now , as he becomes the first foreigner to buy an apartment in Kiev , as he helps negotiate contracts for the printing of Ukrainian currency , as he meets with legislators to help them establish new structures of governance , he rarely needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave eventually , but they said they 'll have a hard time tearing themselves away . <p> " Ever since my childhood , I expected to be in Ukraine . But I never , ever expected to be in Ukraine as it became independent , " Jarosewich said . " I feel like I 'm fulfilling the dreams of my parents and grandparents and great-grandparents , who kept the hope alive generation after generation . I think it 's remarkable I 've lived through this time of history . "
