I remember what somebody said about nostalgia , he said it 's okay to look back , as long as you do n't stare . <p>  --  Tom Paxton , from an interview with Ken Rockburn People have a funny way of remembering where they 've been , who they were . Facts fall by the wayside . Depending on their temperament they either remember a golden time when all was better than well , better than it can be again , better than it ever really was : a first love , the endless expanse of a summer vacation , youthful vigor , the sheer novelty of being alive that gets lost when the world starts wearing you down . Or they focus in on the bad , blow little incidents all out of proportion , hold grudges for years , or maybe they really did have some unlucky times , but now they 're reliving them forever in their heads instead of moving on . <p> But the brain plays tricks on us all , does n't it ? We go by what it tells us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to use as touchstones ? Trouble is we do n't ask for confirmation on what the brain tells us . Things do n't have to be real , we just have to believe they 're real , which pretty much explains politics and religion as much as it does what goes on inside our heads . <p> Do n't get me wrong ; I 'm not pointing any fingers here . My people are n't guiltless either . The only difference is our memories go back a lot further than yours do . <p> " I do n't get computers , " Heather said . <p> Jilly laughed . " What 's not to get ? " <p> They were having cappuccinos in the Cyberbean Cafe , sitting at the long counter with computer terminals spaced along its length the way those little individual juke boxes used to be in highway diners . Jilly looked as though she 'd been using the tips of her dark ringlets as paintbrushes , then cleaned them on the thighs of her jeans  --  in other words , she 'd come straight from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she might allow herself or her studio to get , Heather knew she 'd either cleaned her brushes , or left them soaking in turps before coming down to the cafe . Jilly might seem terminally easygoing , but some things she did n't blow off . No matter how the work was going  --  good , bad or indifferent  --  she treated her tools with respect . <p> As usual , Jilly 's casual scruffiness made Heather feel overdressed , for all that she was only wearing cotton pants and a blouse , nothing fancy . But she always felt a little like that around Jilly , ever since she 'd first taken a class from her at the Newford School of Art a couple of winters ago . No matter how hard she tried , she had n't been able to shake the feeling that she looked so typical : the suburban working mother , the happy wife . The differences since she and lilly had first met were n't great . Her blonde hair had been long then while now it was cropped short . She was wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago she had n't been carrying an empty wasteland around inside her chest <p> " Besides , " Jilly added . " You use a computer at work , do n't you ? " <p> " Sure , but that 's work , " Heather said . " Not games and computer screen romances and stumbling around the Internet , looking for information you 're never going to find a use for outside of Trivial Pursuit . " <p> " I think it 's bringing back a sense of community , " Jilly said . <p> " Oh , right . " <p> " No , think about it . All these people who might have been just vegging out in front of a TV are chatting with each other in cyberspace instead  --  hanging out , so to speak , with kindred spirits that they might never have otherwise met . " <p> Heather sighed . " But it 's not real , human contact . " <p> " No . But at least it 's contact . " <p> " I suppose . " <p> Jilly regarded her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a mild gaze , not in the least probing , but Heather could n't help but feel as though Jilly was seeing right inside her head , all the way down to where desert winds blew through the empty space where her heart had been . <p> " So what 's the real issue ? " Jilly asked . <p> Heather shrugged . " There 's no issue . " She took a sip of her own coffee , then tried on a smile . " I 'm thinking of moving downtown . " <p> " Really ? " <p> " Well , you know . I already work here . There 's a good school for the kids . It just seems to make sense . " <p> " How does Peter feel about it ? " <p> Heather hesitated for a long moment , then sighed again . " Peter 's not really got anything to say about it . " <p> " Oh , no . You guys always seemed so . . . . " Jilly 's voice trailed off . " Well , I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I do n't know what we were anymore . I just know we 're not together . There was n't a big blowup or anything . He was n't cheating on me and I certainly was n't cheating on him . We 're just . . . not together . " <p> " It must be so weird . " <p> Heather nodded . " Very weird . It 's a real shock , suddenly discovering after all these years that we really do n't have much in common at all . " <p> Jilly 's eyes were warm with sympathy . " How are you holding up ? " <p> " Okay , I suppose . But it 's so confusing . I do n't know what to think , who I am , what I thought I was doing with the last fifteen years of my life . I mean , I do n't regret the girls  --  I 'd 've had more children if we could have had them  --  but everything else . . . . " <p> She did n't know how to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was eighteen and I 'm forty-one now . I 've been a part of a couple for longer than I 've been anything else , but except for the girls , I do n't know what any of it meant anymore . I do n't know who I am . I thought we 'd be together forever , that we 'd grow old together , you know ? But now it 's just me . Casey 's fifteen and Janice is twelve . I 've got another few years of being a mother , but after that , who am I ? What am I going to do with myself ? " <p> " You 're still young , " Jilly said . " And you look gorgeous . " <p> " Right . " <p> " Okay . A little pale today , but still . " <p> Heather shook her head . " I do n't know why I 'm telling you this . I have n't told anybody . " <p> " Not even your mom or your sister ? " <p> " Nobody . It 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , the vision blurring , but she made herself take a deep breath . It seemed to help . Not a lot , but some . Enough to carry on . How to explain why she wanted to keep it a secret ? It was n't as though it was something she could keep hidden forever . <p> " I think I feel like a failure , " she said . <p> Her voice was so soft she almost could n't hear herself , but Jilly reached over and took her hand . <p> " You 're not a failure . Things did n't work out , but that does n't mean it was your fault . It takes two people to make or break a relationship . <p> " I suppose . But to have put in all those years . . . . " <p> Jilly smiled " If nothing else , you 've got two beautiful daughters to show for them . " <p> Heather nodded . The girls did a lot to keep the emptiness at bay , but once they were in bed , asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , sitting on the couch by the picture window , staring down the street at all those other houses just like her own , that desolate place inside her seemed to go on forever . <p> She took another sip of her coffee and looked past Jilly to where two young women were sitting at a corner table , heads bent together , whispering . It was hard to place their ages  --  anywhere from late teens to early twenties , sisters , perhaps , with their small builds and similar dark looks , their black clothing and short blue-black hair . For no reason she could explain , simply seeing them made her feel a little better . <p> " Remember what it was like to be so young ? " she said . <p> Jilly turned , following her gaze , then looked back at Heather . <p> " You never think about stuff like this at that age , " Heather went on . <p> " I do n't know , " Jilly said . " Maybe not . But you have a thousand other anxieties that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think ? " <p> Jilly nodded . " I know . We all like to remember it as a perfect time , but most of us were such bundles of messed-up hormones and nerves I 'm surprised we ever managed to reach twenty . " <p> " I suppose . But still , looking at those girls . . . . " <p> Jilly turned again , leaning her head on her arm . " I know what you mean . They 're like a piece of summer on a cold winter 's morning . " <p> It was a perfect analogy , Heather thought , especially considering the winter they 'd been having . Not even the middle of December and the snowbanks were already higher than her chest , the temperature a seriously cold minus-fifteen . <p> " I have to remember their faces , " Jilly went on . " For when I get back to the studio . The way they 're leaning so close to each other  --  like confidantes , sisters in their hearts , if not by blood . And look at the fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes are . " <p> Heather nodded . " It 'd make a great picture . " <p> It would , but the thought of it depressed her . She found herself yearning desperately in that one moment to have had an entirely different life , it almost did n't matter what . Perhaps one that had no responsibility but to draw great art from the world around her the way Jilly did . If she had n't had to support Peter while he was going through law school , maybe she would have stuck with her art . . . . <p> Jilly swiveled in her chair , the sparkle in her eyes deepening into concern once more . <p> " Anything you need , anytime , " she said . " Do n't be afraid to call me . " <p> Heather tried another smile . " We could chat on the Internet . " <p> " I think I agree with what you said earlier : I like this better . " <p> " Me , too , " Heather said . Looking out the window , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maida and Zia are forever friends . Crow girls with spiky blue-black hair and eyes so dark it 's easy to lose your way in them . A little raggedy and never quiet , you ca n't miss this pair : small and wild and easy in their skins , living on Zen time . Sometimes they forget they 're crows , left their feathers behind in the long ago , and sometimes they forget they 're girls . But they never forget that they 're friends . <p> People stop and stare at them wherever they go , borrowing a taste of them , drawn by they do n't know what , they just have to look , try to get close , but keeping their distance , too , because there 's something scary/craving about seeing animal spirits so pure walking around on a city street . It 's a shock , like plunging into cold water at dawn , waking up from the comfortable familiarity of warm dreams to find , if only for a moment , that everything 's changed . And then , just before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on you , maybe you hear giddy laughter , or the slow flap of crows ' wings . Maybe you see a couple of dark-haired girls sitting together in the corner of a cafe , heads bent together , pretending you ca n't see them , or could be they 're perched on a tree branch , looking down at you looking up , working hard at putting on serious faces but they ca n't stop smiling . <p> It 's like that rhyme , " two for mirth . " They ca n't stop smiling and neither can you . But you 've got to watch out for crow girls . Sometimes they wake a yearning you 'll be hard-pressed to put back to sleep . Sometimes only a glimpse of them can start up a familiar ache deep in your chest , an ache you ca n't name , but you 've felt it before , early mornings , lying alone in your bed , trying to hold onto the fading tatters of a perfect dream . Sometimes they blow bright the coals of a longing that ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of the two girls she 'd seen in the cafe earlier in the evening . It was as though they 'd lodged pieces of themselves inside her , feathery slivers winging dreamily across the waste-land . Long after she 'd read Janice a story , then watched the end of a Barbara Walters special with Casey , she found herself sitting up by the big picture window in the living room when she should be in bed herself . She regarded the street through a veil of falling snow , but this time she was n't looking at the houses , so alike except/or the varying heights of their snowbanks they might as well all be the same one . Instead , she was looking for two small women with spiky black hair , dark shapes against the white snow . <p> There was no question but that they knew exactly who they were , she thought when she realized what she was doing . Maybe they could tell her who she was . Maybe they could come up with an exotic past for her so that she could reinvent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of herself . Maybe they could at least tell her where she was going . <p> But there were no thin , dark-haired girls out on the snowy street , and why should there be ? It was too cold . Snow was falling thick with another severe winter storm warning in effect tonight . Those girls were safe at home . She knew that . But she kept looking for them all the same because in her chest she could feel the beat of dark wings  --  not the sudden panic that came out of nowhere when once again the truth of her situation reared without warning in her mind , but a strange , alien feeling . A sense that some otherness was calling to her . <p> The voice of that otherness scared her almost more than the gray landscape lodged in her chest . <p> She felt she needed a safety net , to be able to let herself go and not have to worry about where she fell . Somewhere where she did n't have to think , be responsible , to do anything . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jilly was right about nostalgia . The memories she carried forward were n't necessarily the way things had really happened . But she yearned , if only for a moment , to be able to relive some of those simpler times , those years in high school before she 'd met Peter , before they were married , before her emotions got so complicated . <p> And then what ? <p> You could n't live in the past . At some point you had to come up for air and then the present would be waiting for you , unchanged . The wasteland in her chest would still stretch on forever . She 'd still be trying to understand what had happened . Had Peter changed ? Had she changed ? Had they both changed ? And when did it happen ? How much of their life together had been a lie ? <p> It was enough to drive her mad . <p> It was enough to make her want to step into the otherness calling to her from out there in the storm and snow , step out and simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the girls from the cafe out of her mind either , but for a different reason . As soon as she 'd gotten back to the studio , she 'd taken her current work-in-progress down from the easel and replaced it with a fresh canvas . For a long moment she stared at the texture of the pale ground , a mix of gesso and a light burnt ochre acrylic wash , then she took up a stick of charcoal and began to sketch the faces of the two dark-haired girls before the memory of them left her mind . <p> She was working on their bodies , trying to capture the loose splay of their limbs and the curve of their backs as they 'd slouched in toward each other over the cafe table , when there came a knock at her door . <p> " It 's open , " she called over her shoulder , too intent on what she was doing to look away . <p> " I could 've been some mad , psychotic killer , " Geordie said as he came in . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow from his shoulders and hat . Setting his fiddlecase down by the door , he went over to the kitchen counter to see if Jilly had any coffee on . <p> " But instead , " Jilly said , " it 's only a mad , psychotic fiddler , so I 'm entirely safe . " <p> " There 's no coffee . " <p> " Sure there is . It 's just waiting for you to make it . " <p> Geordie put on the kettle , then rummaged around in the fridge , trying to find which tin lilly was keeping her coffee beans in this week . He found them in one that claimed to hold Scottish shortbreads . <p> " You want some ? " he asked . <p> Jilly shook her head . " How 's Tanya ? " <p> " Heading back to L.A. I just saw her off at the airport . The driving 's horrendous . There were cars in the ditch every couple of hundred feet and I thought the bus would never make it back . " <p> " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geordie smiled . <p> " And then , " she went on , " because you were feeling bored and lonely , you decided to come visit me at two o'clock in the morning . " <p> " Actually , I was out of coffee and I saw your light was on . " He crossed the loft and came around behind the easel so that he could see what she was working on . " Hey , you 're doing the crow girls . " <p> " You know them ? " <p> Geordie nodded . " Maida and Zia . You 've caught a good likeness of them  --  especially Zia . I love that crinkly smile of hers . " <p> " You can tell them apart ? " <p> " You ca n't ? " <p> " I never saw them before tonight . Heather and I were in the Cyberbean and there they were , just asking to be drawn . " She added a bit of shading to the underside of a jaw , then turned to look at Geordie . " Why do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't . Or at least I did n't until I was talking to Jack Daw and that 's what he called them when they came sauntering by . The next time I saw them I was busking in front of St. Paul 's , so I started to play ' The Blackbird , ' just to see what would happen , and sure enough , they came over to talk to me . " <p> " Crow girls , " Jilly repeated . The name certainly fit . <p> " They 're some kind of relation to Jack , " Geordie explained , " but I did n't quite get it . Cousins , maybe . " <p> Jilly was suddenly struck with the memory of a long conversation she 'd had with Jack one afternoon . She was working up sketches of the Crowsea Public Library for a commission when he came and sat beside her on the grass . With his long legs folded under him , black brimmed hat set at a jaunty angle , he 'd regaled her with a long , rambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations . <p> " Animal people , " she said softly . <p> Geordie smiled . " I see he fed you that line , too . " <p> But Jilly was n't really listening  --  not to Geordie . She was remembering another part of that old conversation , something else Jack had told her . <p> " The thing we really do n't get , " he 'd said , leaning back in the grass , " is these contracted families you have . The mother , the father , the children , all living alone in some big house . Our families extend as far as our bloodlines and friendship can reach . " <p> " I do n't know much about bloodlines , " Jilly had said . " But I know about friends . " <p> He 'd nodded . " That 's why I 'm talking to you . " <p> Jilly blinked and looked at Geordie . " It made sense what he said . " <p> Geordie smiled . " Of course it did . Immortal animal people . " <p> " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way we think about families and children . Most people do n't even like kids  --  do n't want to see , hear , or hear about them . But when you look at other cultures , even close to home . . . up on the rez , in Chinatown , Little Italy . . . it 's these big rambling extended families , everybody taking care of everybody else . " <p> Geordie cleared his throat . Jilly waited for him to speak but he went instead to unplug the kettle and finish making the coffee . He ground up some beans and the noise of the hand-cranked machine seemed to reach out and fill every corner of the loft . When he stopped , the sudden silence was profound , as though the city outside was holding its breath along with the in held breath of the room . Jilly was still watching him when he looked over at her . <p> " We do n't come from that kind of family , " he said finally . <p> " I know . That 's why we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night , snow whirling in dervishing gusts , and the crow girls are perched on the top of the wooden fence that 's been erected around a work site on Williamson Street . Used to be a parking lot there , now it 's a big hole in the ground on its way to being one more office complex that nobody except the contractors want . The top of the fence is barely an inch wide at the top and slippery with snow , but they have no trouble balancing there . <p> Zia has a ring with a small spinning disc on it . Painted on the disc is a psychedelic coil that goes spiraling down into infinity . She keeps spinning it and the two of them stare down into the faraway place at the center of the spiral until the disc slows down , almost stops . Then Zia gives it another flick with her fingernail , and the coil goes spiraling down again . <p> " Where 'd you get this anyway ? " Maida asks . <p> Zia shrugs . " Ca n't remember . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket . " <p> " And you never did ? " <p> Maida grins . " Just wish I 'd seen it first , that 's all . " <p> They watch the disc some more , content . <p> " What do you think it 's like down there ? " Zia says after a while . " On the other side of the spiral . " <p> Maida has to think about that for a moment . " Same as here , " she finally announces , then winks . " Only dizzier . " <p> They giggle , leaning into each other , tottering back and forth on their perch , crow girls , ca n't be touched , ca n't hardly be seen , except someone 's standing down there on the sidewalk , looking up through the falling snow , his worried expression so comical it sets them off on a new round of giggles . <p> " Careful now ! " he calls up to them . He thinks they 're on drugs - they can tell . " You do n't want to  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let themselves fall backward , off the fence . <p> " Oh , Christ ! " <p> He jumps , gets a handhold on the top of the fence and hauls himself up . But when he looks over , over and down , way down , there 's nothing to be seen . No girls lying at the bottom of that big hole in the ground , nothing at all . Only the falling snow . It 's like they were never there . <p> His arms start to ache and he lowers himself back down the fence , lets go , bending his knees slightly to absorb the impact of the last couple of feet . He slips , catches his balance . It seems very still for a moment , so still he can hear an odd rhythmical whispering sound . Like wings . He looks up , but there 's too much snow coming down to see anything . A cab comes by , skidding on the slick street , and he blinks . The street 's full of city sounds again , muffled , but present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , their shoulders and hair white with snow . A snowplow a few streets over . A distant siren . <p> He continues along his way , but he 's walking slowly now , trudging through the drifts , not thinking so much of two girls sitting on top of a fence as remembering how , when he was a boy , he used to dream that he could fly . <p> After fiddling a little more with her sketch , Jilly finally put her charcoal down . She made herself a cup of herbal tea with the leftover hot water in the kettle and joined Geordie where he was sitting on the sofa , watching the snow come down . It was warm in the loft , almost cozy compared to the storm on the other side of the windowpanes , or maybe because of the storm . Jilly leaned back on the sofa , enjoying the companionable silence for a while before she finally spoke . <p> " How do you feel after seeing the crow girls ? " she asked . <p> Geordie turned to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel ? " <p> " You know , good , bad . . . different . . . " <p> Geordie smiled . " Do n't you mean ' indifferent ? ' " <p> " Maybe . " She picked up her tea from the crate where she 'd set it and took a sip . " Well ? " she asked when he did n't continue . <p> " Okay . How do I feel ? Good , I suppose . They 're fun , they make me smile . In fact , just thinking of them now makes me feel good . " <p> Jilly nodded thoughtfully as he spoke . " Me , too . And something else as well . " <p> " The different , " Geordie began . He did n't quite sigh . " You believe those stories of Jack 's , do n't you ? " <p> " Of course . And you do n't ? " <p> " I 'm not sure , " he replied , surprising her . <p> " Well , I think these crow girls were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Like in that rhyme about crows . " <p> Geordie got it right away . " Two for mirth . " <p> Jilly nodded . " Heather needed some serious cheering up . Maybe even something more . You know how when you start feeling low , you can get on this descending spiral of depression . . . everything goes wrong , things get worse , because you expect them to ? " <p> " Fight it with the power of positive thinking , I always say . " <p> " Easier said than done when you 're feeling that low . What you really need at a time like that is something completely unexpected to kick you out of it and remind you that there 's more to life than the hopeless , gray expanse you think is stretching in every direction . What Colin Wilson calls absurd good news . " <p> " You 've been talking to my brother . " <p> " It does n't matter where I got it from  --  it 's still true . " <p> Geordie shook his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed up just to put your friend in a better mood . Even bird people can get a craving for a cup of coffee , ca n't they ? " <p> " Well , yes , " Jilly said . " But that does n't preclude their being there for Heather as well . Sometimes when a person needs something badly enough , it just comes to them . A personal kind of steam engine time . You might not be able to articulate what it is you need , you might not even know you need something  --  at least , not at a conscious level  --  but the need 's still there , calling out to whatever 's willing to listen . " <p> Geordie smiled . " Like animal spirits . " <p> " Crow girls . " <p> Geordie shook his head . " Drink your tea and go to bed , " he told her . " I think you need a good night 's sleep . " <p> " But  --  " <p> " It was only a coincidence . Things do n't always have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how do you even know they had any effect on Heather ? " <p> " I could just tell . And do n't change the subject . " <p> " I 'm not . " <p> " Okay , " Jilly said . " But do n't you see ? It does n't matter if it was a coincidence or not . They still showed up when Heather needed them . It 's more of that ' small world , spooky world ' stuff Professor Dapple goes on about . Everything 's connected . It does n't matter if we ca n't see how , it 's still all connected . You know , chaos theory and all that . " <p> Geordie shook his head , but he was smiling . " Does it ever strike you as weird when something Bramley 's talked up for years suddenly becomes an acceptable element of scientific study ? " <p> " Nothing strikes me as truly weird , " Jilly told him . " There 's only stuff I have n't figured out yet . " <p> Heather barely slept that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , and then when she finally did , she was awake by dawn . Wide awake , but heavy with an exhaustion that came more from heartache than lack of sleep . <p> Sitting up against the headboard , she tried to resist the sudden tightness in her chest , but that sad , cold wasteland swelled inside her . The bed seemed depressingly huge . She did n't so much miss Peter 's presence as feel adrift in the bed 's expanse of blankets and sheets . Adrift in her life . Why was it he seemed to have no trouble carrying on when the simple act of getting up in the morning felt as though it would require far more energy than she could ever hope to muster ? <p> She stared at the snow swirling against her window , not at all relishing the drive into town on a morning like this . If anything , it was coming down harder than it had been last night . All it took was the suggestion of snow and everybody in the city seemed to forget how to drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blizzard like this would snarl traffic and back it up as far as the mountains . <p> She sighed , supposing it was just as well she 'd woken so early since it would take her at least an extra hour to get downtown today . <p> Up , she told herself , and forced herself to swing her feet to the floor and rise . A shower helped . It did n't really ease the headache , but the hiss of the water made it easier to ignore her thoughts . Coffee , when she was dressed and had brewed a pot , helped more , though she still winced when Janice came bounding into the kitchen . <p> " It 's a snow day ! " she cried . " No school . They just announced it on the radio . The school 's closed , closed , closed ! " <p> She danced about in her flannel nightie , pirouetting in the small space between the counter and the table . <p> " Just yours , " Heather asked , " or Casey 's , too ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following her sister into the room . <p> Unlike Janice , she was maintaining her cool , but Heather could tell she was just as excited . Too old to allow herself to take part in Janice 's spontaneous celebration , but young enough to be feeling giddy with the unexpected holiday . <p> " Good , " Heather said . " You can look after your sister . " <p> " Mom ! " Janice protested . " I 'm not a baby . " <p> " I know . It 's just good to have someone older in the house when  --  " <p> " You ca n't be thinking of going in to work today , " Casey said . <p> " We could do all kinds of stuff , " Janice added . " Finish decorating the house . Baking . " <p> " Yeah , " Casey said , " all the things we do n't seem to have time for anymore . " <p> Heather sighed . " The trouble is , " she explained , " the real world does n't work like school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casey shook her head . " That is so unfair . " <p> The phone rang before Heather could agree . <p> " I 'll bet it 's your boss , " Janice said as Heather picked up the phone . " Calling to tell you it 's a snow day for you , too . " <p> Do n't I wish , Heather thought . But then what would she do at home all day ? It was so hard being here , even with the girls , and much as she loved them . Everywhere she turned , something reminded her of how the promises of a good life had turned into so much ash . At least work kept her from brooding . <p> She brought the receiver up to her ear and spoke into the mouthpiece . " Hello ? " <p> " I 've been thinking , " the voice on the other end of the line said . " About last night . " <p> Heather had to smile . Was n't that so Jilly , calling up first thing in the morning as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation . <p> " What about last night ? " she said . <p> " Well , all sorts of stuff . Like remembering a perfect moment in the past and letting it carry you through a hard time now . " <p> If only , Heather thought . " I do n't have a moment that perfect , " she said . <p> " I sort of got that feeling , " Jilly told her . " That 's why I think they were a message  --  a kind of perfect moment now that you can use the same way . " <p> " What are you talking about ? " <p> " The crow girls . In the cafe last night . <p> " The crow . . . . " It took her a moment to realize what Jilly meant . Their complexions had been dark enough so she supposed they could have been Indians . " How do you know what tribe they belonged to ? " <p> " Not Crow , Native American , " Jilly said , " but crow , bird people . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jilly went on to say , for all that only her daughters were here to see the movement . Glum looks had replaced their earlier excitement when they realized the call was n't from her boss . <p> " Do you have any idea how improbable all of this sounds ? " she asked when Jilly finished . " Life 's not like your paintings . " <p> " Says who ? " <p> " How about common sense ? " <p> " Tell me , " Jilly said . " Where did common sense ever get you ? " <p> Heather sighed . " Things do n't happen just because we want them to , " she said . <p> " Sometimes that 's exactly why they happen , " Jilly replied . " They happen because we need them to . " <p> " I do n't live in that kind of a world . " <p> " But you could . " <p> Heather looked across the kitchen at her daughters once more . The girls were watching her , trying to make sense out of the one-sided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was hearing both sides and that did n't seem to help at all . You could n't simply reinvent your world because you wanted to . Things just were how they were . <p> " Just think about it , " Jilly added . " Will you do that much ? " <p> " I . . . " <p> That bleak landscape inside Heather seemed to expand , growing so large there was no way she could contain it . She focused on the faces of her daughters . She remembered the crow girls in the cafe . There was so much innocence in them all , daughters and crow girls . She 'd been just like them once and she knew it was n't simply nostalgia coloring her memory . She knew there 'd been a time when she lived inside each particular day , on its own and by itself , instead of trying to deal with all the days of her life at once , futilely attempting to reconcile the discrepancies and mistakes . <p> " I 'll try , " she said into the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receiver . <p> " Who was that , Mom ? " Casey asked . <p> Heather looked out the window . The snow was still falling , muffling the world . Covering its complexities with a blanket as innocent as the hope she saw in her daughters ' eyes . <p> " Jilly , " she said . She took a deep breath , then smiled at them . " She was calling to tell me that today really is a snow day . " <p> The happiness that flowered on their faces helped ease the tightness in her chest . The gray landscape waiting for her there did n't go away , but for some reason , it felt less profound . She was n't even worried about what her boss would say when she called in to tell him she would n't be in today . <p> Crow girls can move like ghosts . They 'll slip into your house when you 're not home , sometimes when you 're only sleeping , go walking spirit-soft through your rooms and hallways , sit in your favorite chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two which they 'll mean to return and usually do . It 's not break &; enter so much as simple curiosity . They 're worse than cats . <p> Privacy is n't in their nature . They do n't seek it and barely understand the concept . Personal property is even more alien . The idea of ownership  --  that one can lay proprietary claim to a piece of land , an object , another person or creature  --  does n't even register . <p> " Whatcha looking at ? " Zia asks . <p> They do n't know whose house they 're in . Walking along on the street , trying to catch snowflakes on their tongues , one or the other of them suddenly got the urge to come inside . Upstairs , the family sleeps . <p> Maida shows her the photo album . " Look , " she says . " It 's the same people , but they keep changing . See , here she 's a baby , then she 's a little girl , then a teenager . " <p> " Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . Look at Crazy Crow . " <p> " But it happens so fast with them . " <p> Zia sits down beside her and they pore over the pictures , munching on apples they found earlier in a cold cellar in the basement . <p> Upstairs , a father wakes in his bed . He stares at the ceiling , wondering what woke him . Nervous energy crackles inside him like static electricity , a sudden spill of adrenaline , but he does n't know why . He gets up and checks the children 's rooms . They 're both asleep . He listens for intruders , but the house is silent . <p> Stepping back into the hall , he walks to the head of the stairs and looks down . He thinks he sees something in the gloom , two dark-haired girls sitting on the sofa , looking through a photo album . Their gazes lift to meet his and hold it . The next thing he knows , he 's on the sofa himself , holding the photo album in his hand . There are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quieter than it 's ever been , as though the fridge , the furnace and every clock the family owns are holding their breath along with him . <p> He sets the album down on the coffee table , walks slowly back up the stairs and returns to his bed . He feels like a stranger , misplaced . He does n't know this room , does n't know the woman beside him . All he can think about is the first girl he ever loved and his heart swells with a bittersweet sorrow . An ache pushes against his ribs , makes it almost impossible to breathe . <p> What if , what if . . . . <p> He turns on his side and looks at his wife . For one moment her face blurs , becomes a morphing image that encompasses both her features and those of his first true love . For one moment it seems as though anything is possible , that for all these years he could have been married to another woman , to that girl who first held , then , unwittingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> His wife stirs , her features her own again . She blinks sleepily at him . <p> " What . . . ? " she mumbles . <p> He holds her close , heartbeat drumming , more in love with her for being who she is than he has ever been before . <p> Outside , the crow girls are lying on their backs , making snow angels on his lawn , scissoring their arms and legs , shaping skirts and wings . They break their apple cores in two and give their angels eyes , then run off down the street , holding hands . The snow drifts are undisturbed by their weight . It 's as though they , too , like the angels they 've just made , also have wings . <p> " This is so cool , " Casey tells her mother . " It really feels like Christmas . I mean , not like Christmases we 've had , but , you know , like really being part of Christmas . " <p> Heather nods . She 's glad she brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her friends serve a Christmas dinner to those less fortunate than themselves . She 's been worried about how her daughters would take the break from tradition , but then realized , with Peter gone , tradition is already broken . Better to begin all over again . <p> The girls had been dubious when she first broached the subject with them  --  " I do n't want to spend Christmas with losers , " had been Casey 's first comment . <p> Heather had n't argued with her . All she 'd said was , " I want you to think about what you just said . " <p> Casey 's response had been a sullen look  --  there were more and more of these lately  --  but Heather knew her own daughter well enough . Casey had stomped off to her room , but then come back half an hour later and helped her explain to Janice why it might not be the worst idea in the world . <p> She watches them now , Casey having rejoined her sister where they are playing with the homeless children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good kids , she thinks as she takes another sip of her cider . After a couple of hours serving coffee , tea and hot cider , she 'd really needed to get off her feet for a moment . <p> " Got something for you , " Jilly says , sitting down on the bench beside her . <p> Heather accepts the small , brightly wrapped parcel with reluctance . " I thought we said we were n't doing Christmas presents . " <p> " It 's not really a Christmas present . It 's more an everyday sort of a present that I just happen to be giving you today . " <p> " Right . " <p> " So are n't you going to open it ? " <p> Heather peels back the paper and opens the small box . Inside , nestled in a piece of folded Kleenex , are two small silver earrings cast in the shapes of crows . <p> Heather lifts her gaze . <p> " They 're beautiful . " <p> " Got them at the craft show from a local jeweler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box . They 're to remind you  --  " <p> Heather smiles . " Of crow girls ? " <p> " Partly . But more to remember that this  --  " Jilly waves a hand that could be taking in the basement of St. Vincent 's , could be taking in the whole world . " It 's not all we get . There 's more . We ca n't always see it , but it 's there . " <p> For a moment , Heather thinks she sees two dark-haired slim figures standing on the far side of the basement , but when she looks more closely they 're only a bag lady and Geordie 's friend Tanya , talking . <p> For a moment , she thinks she hears the sound of wings , but it 's only the murmur of conversation . Probably . <p> What she knows for sure is that the gray landscape inside her chest is shrinking a little more , every day . <p> " Thank you , " she says . <p> She is n't sure if she 's speaking to Jilly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but whose presence keeps echoing through her life . Her new life . It is n't necessarily a better one . Not yet . But at least it 's on the way up from wherever she 'd been going , not down into a darker despair . <p> " Here , " Jilly says .
