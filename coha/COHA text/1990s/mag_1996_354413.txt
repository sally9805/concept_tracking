ICICLES  --  SIX FEET LONG , AND AT THEIR TIPS , as bright and sharp as needles  --  hang from the eaves : wild ice stalactites , dragon 's teeth . I peer through them to see the world transformed to abstract whiteout . Little dervish snow tornadoes twirl across the blank . The car is out there somewhere , represented by a subtle bump in the snowfield . The old Jeep truck , a larger beast , is up to its door handles , like a sinking remnant : dinosaur yielding to ice age . The town 's behemoth snowplow passes on the road , dome light twirling , and casts aside a frozen doe that now lies , neck broken , upon the roadside snowbank , soon to vanish under the snowfall still to come . <P> There is a double-jointed consciousness at work in the dramatics of big weather . Down in the snowstorm , we are as mortal as the deer . I sink to my waist in a drift , I panic , my arms claw for an instant , like a drowning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the storm collapse with coronaries , snow shovels in their hands , cheeks gone a deathly color , like frostbitten plums . <P> Yet when we go upstairs to consult the Weather Channel , we settle down , as cozy gods do , to hover high above the earth and watch the map with a divine perspective . Moist air labeled L for low rides up the continent from the Gulf of Mexico and collides with the high that has slid down from the North Pole . And thus is whipped up the egg-white fluff on the studio map that , down in the frozen , messy world , buries mortals . <P> An odd new metaphysics of weather : it is not that weather has necessarily grown more apocalyptic . The famous " Winter of the Blue Snow " of 1886-87 turned rivers of the American West into glaciers that when they thawed , carried along inundations of dead cattle . Theodore Roosevelt was virtually ruined as a rancher by the weather that destroyed 65% of his herd . In the annus mirabilis of 1811 , the Mississippi River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> What 's new is the theater of it . Television does not create weather , any more than it creates contemporary politics . However , the ritual ceremonies of televised weather have endowed a subject often previously banal with an amazing life as mass entertainment , nationwide interactive preoccupation and a kind of immense performance art . <P> What we have is weather as electronic American Shintoism , a casual but almost mystic daily religion wherein nature is not inert but restless , stirring , alive with kinetic fronts and meanings and turbulent expectations ( forecasts , variables , prophecies ) . We have installed an elaborate priesthood and technology of interpretation : acolytes and satellites preside over snow and circuses . At least major snowstorms have about them an innocence and moral neutrality that is more refreshing than the last national television spectacle , the O.J. Simpson trial .
