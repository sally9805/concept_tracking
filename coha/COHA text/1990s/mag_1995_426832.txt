Section : THE KITCHEN GARDEN <p> If you want to grow vegetables in Vermont , you need to grab all the sun you can . Soil can be improved , drainage or irrigation added , terracing built , but access to the sun is nearly immutable . When my wife , Ellen , and I bought property to start a market garden and nursery , the land was just an overgrown , abandoned sheep pasture . But that did n't matter . We chose it for the aspect : a southwest ridge , open to the sun on all sides and overlooking a small intervale that we hoped was big enough to draw down the frosty air on early-spring nights . <p> For the first 10 years we devoted our efforts to establishing the market garden , building greenhouses and creating three acres of trial fields where we test new plants for our seed catalog , which grew from a sideline into our main livelihood . All that time we were captivated by a damn-the-aesthetics , full-speed-ahead production mentality . Then one summer we pulled back in horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our lives had been given over to work . We decided then and there to take the prime spot on our property , a small saddle of land just below the house , and make it over into a kitchen garden for our family that would be productive , yes , practical yes , but also a joy to be in , a joy to work in , a joy to live in . <p> Its design is classic in concept , but " country " in execution . We like to think of it as Vermont funky formal . That means relaxed , but not messy . We do not tolerate weeds , and though our beds are full of volunteers from the poppies , the clary sage , the nicotianas , and the hollyhocks , any plant that is out of place is out of luck . In the vegetable sections we plant on a French-intensive hexagonal pattern , allowing each plant the space it needs , no more , no less . This geometric approach is evident throughout the garden , from the overall layout to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants like beans , tomatoes , morning glories , and cup-and-saucer vine . We use bamboo and twine for most of our trellises . This creates a consistent aesthetic that works with the near formality of the overall design to bind the garden together . <p> The basic arrangement of our kitchen garden is similar to that of the botanic garden at Padua , Italy , built in the 1500s and long considered the model for kitchen gardens . Often referred to as the four-square design , it had four beds of equal size forming a square . To accommodate all our plants and make the most of the site , however , we doubled its length along the southwest-to-northeast axis of the hill . <p> The garden had to be low maintenance , so we chose to make permanent beds and paths . The design also had to be convenient for rotations and the use of season-stretching covers or cloches , so we made the beds of consistent dimension , with the six main beds 12 feet by 20 feet and all the others some multiple of 4 feet wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paths heavily mulched with bark . All the paths are designed for access with our two-wheeled garden cart . Within the larger beds we use 10-foot-long 2-by-12 boards as temporary paths to avoid compacting the soil when planting or cultivating . <p> We have solid fencing on the uphill and upwind sides , but picket fence on the downhill and southern sides so that the cold air can drain away on frosty mornings . Against the inside of this weathered wood perimeter there are permanent beds for summer- and fall-bearing raspberries , day-neutral strawberries established as stay-at-home perennials , a dozen blueberry bushes , even a few especially hardy grapevines such as ' King of the North ' trained against the north wall . Other parts of the perimeter  --  both inside and outside the fence  --  are planted to old-fashioned roses , perennials , and herbs hardy enough to take our thirty-below-zero winters . <p> The lower , main section has four 12-by-20-foot beds separated by paths that radiate from a semidwarf ' Cortland ' apple in the center , where , before the invention of modern irrigation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unadorned , but the two along the hill 's axis are lined on one side of the tree with our allium collection and on the other with hedges of peonies . <p> The upper section is more of a patchwork , with narrow beds of ' Jersey ' hybrid asparagus and Oriental and Asiatic lilies flanking the main access to our toolshed , and two square beds , 12 by 12 feet , matched to the combined width of the narrow ones and their paths . We vary the plantings in these two , changing them every season . At the top of our kitchen garden are two more 12-by-20-foot beds , one a nursery , bed for trialing or holding new plants , and the other for the children , with a playhouse in the center and plenty of room for their spinach and carrots ( Sam wants to be strong and see in the dark ) , their ' Sugar Snap ' peas and ' Sweet 100 ' tomatoes ( who needs a reason ? ) and their gladioli , zinnias , and nasturtiums . The choices are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bean vines that guards the door to the playhouse , " so no grownups can come in . " <p> Our own vegetables are likely to be fennel , celeriac , parsnip , and salsify , crops that we grow only in small quantities , plus salad greens that require special attention like mesclun , radicchio , and witloof . There is always room , too , for a few climbing peas and beans , some early tomatoes , and a smattering of warm-weather crops like ' Charentais ' melons that will produce well in small spaces with a favorable spot and a little extra attention . <p> The flower border is home to just-out-of-zone perennials like crambe and eremurus , as well as old standards such as delphiniums , hollyhocks , and globe thistles , which thrive in our cool , moist climate . For a kind of cottage garden craziness , we top off the border with the odd annual like ' Polar Star ' chrysanthemum , ' Blue Cloud ' larkspur , ' Mystery Rose ' cynoglossum , and ' Angel Wing ' poppy that have turned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our goal has been to create a garden that contains all those things we want as a family : fresh salads , vegetables for the table  --  and the herbs with which to flavor them  --  fruit for the bowl , and flowers for cutting or to scent the air . And more . We want our garden to be a pleasant place in which to work , or in which to spend a summer evening eating in the arbor while the swallows , then the bats , swoop and dive . We even want it to be an appealing landscape to enjoy from the vantage of our office over the garage . <p> Then , too , we use our kitchen garden as a place for the kids to get an introduction both to how and where we get our food , and to microbiology , botany , entomology  --  no , wait , to soil and plants and bugs  --  in a place that has sprinklers to run through . Just as we want to mix the flowers and the food  --  the pleasure and the practicality  --  we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the learning that is a natural part of it  --  gaining the physical skills involved in thinning and transplanting , the conceptual skills of laying out a bed of flowers , the forethought and patience that are an inextricable part of the whole process of sowing , care , and harvest . <p> Overall , the garden has fulfilled our dream and has met the needs that led to its creation . If I have one complaint , it is that there is not enough room to do everything I 'd like . At 60 by 120 feet , it is larger than most kitchen gardens , but there is hardly room for standard crops like corn , potatoes , and pumpkins . We still grow those as field crops . Our garden has indeed been our funky but formal dream come true . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Left : The Ogdens ' house overlooks the gardens .
