Section : technical page <p> Q : I have a dry oil painting is more than a year old and I am wondering if it is safe for me to paint on it now . <p> A : Completely dried oil paintings have been painted over throughout the history of oil painting  --  some six hundred years . Oil paint is a very durable medium ; it has remained popular and effective for so long because of its excellent manipulative qualities and its capacity for extensive technical variations . Therefore , there should be no problem in continuing to work on a painting after it has dried , as long as there is not a thick layer of either damar or methacrylate varnish over the dried painting . Just be certain to remove all traces of varnish before adding any paint . <p> Also , be sure the fresh paint you apply has sufficient oil to conform to the fat-over-lean rule . It is imperative that you adhere to this rule , especially when the underlying paint films are completely dry . <p> Q : Many artists state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what kind do they use ? Ralph Mayer recommends cradling wood panels in The Artist 's Handbook ( The Viking Press ) , so should I cradle it ? If so , should I leave the Masonite bare under the cradling or gesso it ? <p> A : There seems to an endless flow of questions concerning the use of Masonite as a rigid painting surface , ranging from whether or not Masonite is considered permanent to how to keep it from warping or bending . Since this subject seems to be important to so many artists , it finds its way into this column once again . <p> Roughly speaking , Masonite is wood that has been recreated without the disadvantage of wood grain running the length of the panel . Since Masonite is without the typical grain found in lumber , its expansion rate is much less than lumber and it therefore remains more stable . <p> Masonite and Presdwood are proprietary names for the product , which is made from wood chips reduced to fibers by high-pressure steam . The fibers are then reconstructed into panels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1/2 " ) by extreme pressure and heat . In the wood fibers , a chemical element known as linguins acts as a natural adhesive , producing a flat surface with a stable rate of expansion and contraction . <p> Masonite is prone to disintegration at the edges if it is handled roughly in transport or storage . The vulnerability of a Masonite panel in this respect is one of the primary reasons that conservators recommend avoiding it as a painting support . However , if the edges are protected by a frame of stripping , you can effectively prevent breaking and chipping of the panel . <p> Although Masonite is considered a questionable support by many conservators , its low cost and availability make it a desirable painting surface for sketches and studies , and it can be readily prepared for more major works . If you are using Masonite as a surface , be sure to purchase only untempered ( standard ) Masonite ; the tempered variety is impregnated with a waterproof material that will darken the painting in a relatively short time . But , remember , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film ; therefore , as a preventive measure , apply a proper ground to act as a buffer . True glue gesso made with precipitated chalk and titanium white pigment or an acrylic polymer primer will accomplish this task . <p> As far as warping or bending goes , Masonite typically curves , especially in the larger sizes . Painting an equal thickness of primer on both sides will help . But the better choice is what you 've mentioned  --  cradling  --  which simply involves gluing a reinforcing frame , including a crosspiece , onto the back of the panel . <p> Q : I stretched my canvas in a traditional way and did everything right , applying rabbitskin glue and lead white . But now there seems to be lead white coming through the back of the canvas . Is this a problem ? <p> A : The situation does not sound as if it has anything to do with the rabbitskin glue or the primer . If the primer is coming through the back , it is probably due to the open weave of the canvas . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use has a fine or coarse weave as long as the threads are woven together tightly enough so that the material does not exhibit large pinholes when held up to the light . If your canvas has a close weave and is properly sized with rabbitskin glue , small traces of priming coming through the back should be of no concern . However , if the linen has a very loose weave and a good deal of primer is coming through the back , then the fabric probably should not have been used in the first place ; it will not be a stable support . Chances are that it will sag quite a bit , and the priming will be prone to cracking because of excessive expansion and contraction . <p> By the way , the best-quality linens come from Ireland and Northern Europe and have a tight , close weave . <p> Q : When matting a drawing , can I use self-adhesive tape ? <p> A : Sadly , none of the self-adhesive tapes that are available for matting is recommended for use by conservators . Although convenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect or stain the drawing paper to which they are attached . And while some of the manufacturers of these products state that they are safe and pH-balanced , none of them is absolutely neutral . <p> In order to be considered safe , any kind of framing or matting procedure must not permanently affect the work of art . In other words , if something is attached to the piece or encloses it for protection , it must be easily removed without a trace ; otherwise , the value of the work may be diminished . <p> The preferable way to mount drawings is on one-hundred-percent-rag museum board , using Japanese paper hinges and wheat-starch paste . This system provides a strong archival mount for protecting and displaying prints and drawings that is thoroughly reversible . This reversibility is not always possible with the self-adhesive varieties . <p> Quality museum board for mats and supports and Japanese paper for hinges may be purchased at most good art-materials stores . Although there are now good pulp mat boards that contain a buffering agent to protect against the acids in the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paste comes in a paste powder that must be prepared freshly before application . It is cooked in a double boiler for about fifteen minutes with constant , vigorous stirring . <p> There are a number of implements and materials to effectively cook and sieve wheat-starch paste , which is the best reversible adhesive for the Japanese-paper hinges . These , along with the wheat-starch paste itself , can be obtained at fine-art and book-conservation supply houses at a minimal cost . To cook the wheat-starch paste , you will need a porcelain or glass double boiler ; the wheat-starch paste must never come into contact with metal . Then , all you need is a wooden spatula , a sieve made of plastic or horsehair , and a little patience . For directions on cooking wheat-starch paste and properly matting your drawings , Anne Clapp 's Curatorial Care of Works of Art on Paper ( Nick Lyons Press ) is an excellent book . <p> There is also a cold wheat-starch available that is mixed with calcium carbonate . This paste is much easier to make than wheat-starch paste but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Steven Sheehan <p>
