OBEDIENT TO BLITHELY IMPERIOUS DAUGHTERS wedging her into an orchid prom dress , the oldest tourniqueting a lace dresser scarf about her throat , the youngest hopping on the bed with Tinkerbell makeup blotching frosted lavender above the eyes , fuschia on and off the lips , bull's-eyes of rouge over the cheeks , the conclusive irony of a rhinestone tiara clamped on her middle-aged head , amusing her . Indulgent to children she adores , resigned to a life she had hoped to love . <p> With theatric pomp for so small a circumstance , they lead her , white half-slips on their heads , black polyester skirts belted against their chests , draping in stubby columns to the floor . Nuns . Freshly enrolled in Catholic school , her daughters compulsively act out ritual , impose doctrine . Tchaikovsky 's Swan Lake , gargling and tinny , accompanies them from the Fisher Price record player to the arched entry of an adobe living room where Alan , her husband , and the young Hispanic man are re-mudding a corner fireplace . <p> Her youngest tugs her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the oldest makes trumpeting sounds . <p> " Hey Dad . Check out Mom . We made her beautiful . " <p> The young man tums to see . Their father crooks his head out of the fireplace , smiles , asks about lunch . <p> Orchid taffeta rustles under the baggy , knee-length gray sweatshirt as she serves lunch . She watches him dump half a jar of salsa on his hamburger , hears him say he 'd like to take off work tomorrow and go hunting . Observes Alan , an ecologically hypersensitive man , in his favorite T-shirt , " Do n't Eat Anything With a Face , " hypocritically vegetarian , scarfing down two hamburgers . <p> Perched on the counter , she swings her feet , swishing the taffeta loudly , on purpose . <p> " Gee , I 'd like to go . What is it you 're hunting ? " <p> " Deer . " <p> Alan scrapes his chair back . <p> " Well , you two go hunting , shoot up a storm , though I 'm adamantly opposed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come across anything but trees , rocks , and roadkill  --  all that 's left out there anyway . " <p> He hikes up his pants , grins or grimaces , she ca n't tell most of the time , leaves the kitchen . From the living room they hear him belch hugely before answering the phone , fielding yet another business call . Alan is a wildly successful tile manufacturer . <p> The young man brings his plate and her husband 's to the sink , rinses them while looking at her , the frowzy dress , virulent makeup . <p> " Thank you . Lunch was excellent . " <p> " You 're quite welcome . I noticed you like salsa . " <p> " Did you mean it  --  about going hunting ? " <p> " Yes . I really do want to go , but only if I do n't have to kill anything . Have you heard of Waiting for Godot ? It 's this play where one of the characters , Vladimir , says , " Habit is a great deadener . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been breaking habits . If I go , I 'll just watch ; I 'll be a hunting voyeur . " <p> " That 's fine . I 'll come for you tomorrow at 4:30 so we get to the mountains by first light . You have wool socks , gloves , long underwear ? " He is scanning her body . " I have an extra pair of camouflage pants I got at the flea market and an orange vest . I 'll bring those for you . " <p> " Do I bring the VCR ? Just kidding . Can you imagine , home hunting videos ? " <p> " No , that 's OK . I 'll bring everything . " <p> She sets out the girls ' lunch , then watches them awhile from the living room window . They are kneeling inside the walled garden beside an oval of fresh-dug dirt , profiles uptilted in morbid prayer . Her oldest intones from Alan 's childhood Catholic missal , now an occult prop . Her youngest grips an unlit pink dinner candle . The pet cemetery is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One cat , a road victim . Two birds , cat victims . And four lunch bags of shriveling pet-shop mice , tied and swaying like homemade ornaments from the arthritic crabapple . She wo n't ask , does n't want to know . Children assault animals with wild swings of adoration and neglect . <p> She watches out the same window , this time seeing his truck , headlights ploughing like twin stars up the driveway lined with brittle , naked elms . Her husband and children are asleep at the farthest black end of the hallway . <p> She has trouble with the camouflage pants , has to come out of the bathroom ; he kneels to unknot and retie strings that gather around the ankles . " Long underwear ? " She nods , embarrassed . He stands up . He has to touch her hips to secure the canteen , the hunting knife in its leather sheath . They whisper . <p> " What ? " <p> " I feel like a female guerrilla . " <p> " What 's this ? " <p> " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " She hands him a stick of incense . " They like playing church . Weddings with no groom . Funerals . Mostly funerals . " <p> They walk out to the truck ; purple-black , freckled with white mud , punched in numerous places . Red bandannas with black electrical tape bandage the broken taillights . In the truck bed are two chunks of cedar , a rotted tire , length of rope , plastic water jug , tricycle wheel , and four or five beer cans . She knows this even in darkness . Once when he had left it on their property to go fishing with friends , Alan had discovered her sitting , just sitting in his truck . She 'd made a lame excuse about getting out of the heat , which Alan distractedly , good-naturedly ( naive for all of his intelligence ) accepted . <p> She gets in on his side , the other door broken , sidles under the steering wheel . The seat 's caved in , stuffed with blankets and towels . Clumsy in her hunting regalia , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangs by a hinge . Receipts , cards , feathers , a box of bullets  --  she catches some in her hands , scoops the rest from the floor , apologizing . <p> Handing her the rifle , he gets in , slams the door . The truck clanks , rattles like a junk drawer ; the heater abrades her face with silty , hot air ; the gun is anchored across her lap , a Winchester 243 , an elk etched into the oak butt which she traces with her thumb . In the green-andviolet light off the dash , she watches him stick the incense where black vinyl has peeled down to bile-colored foam . <p> Heading into the mountains in his truck , with its Clearasil-tinted interior , broken speedometer , needle gyrating ( Mock 10 ; we 're at Mock 10 , he says ) ... the highway a black current beneath the torn gear boot , candy wrappers , work gloves , rolls of electrical tape , toilet paper , sunrotted parrot feathers fanning out of the visor , catprints arrowing up the windshield , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Chinese-noodle mix , the whole inside stinking of soured sponge , overheated plastic , and dead , crumbling styrofoam . He is telling a joke about two drunk mice and Elvis Presley . <p> " Coffee ? " She lofts the thermos . " We can share from the cup-thingy on top . " <p> " Sure . " He navigates a dirt road sculpted with potholes and washboard gullies , saying he graded this road for the forest service two years before . Compressed against the roadsides are gothic , violet spires of ponderosa , streaks of white aspen . He is looking at her . <p> " What are you thinking ? " <p> " How I was a member of the Canadian and American Wolf Defenders League , the Wild Horse and Burro Association , the Cousteau Society , the Sierra Club , how I had Save the Whale , Save the Turtle , what else , oh , Save the Dolphin stickers on my old station wagon in Illinois . I 'm an environmentalist , so I 'm feeling guilty . I 'm also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My mind rejects meat , but my stomach wo n't . " <p> " Well , we 're not out here shooting animals for the sick thrill of it . My family 's always hunted for survival ; we use every part of the deer , the elk . " <p> " You 're saying you 're not a sport hunter ? " <p> " You bet . I 'm not one of those guys who flies in not knowing wildlife from his own ass . " <p> " I love deer . Actually I love armadillos . I was going to buy an armadillo , until somebody said they can give you leprosy . Can you believe it ? " <p> He hits a deep gully and they both fly off the seat ; her head grazes the ceiling and she slops coffee all over . <p> " Oops . Your pants , sorry . Camouflage works . They should make children 's clothes out of this stuff . " <p> He laughs . They 've reached the mountaintop , fishtailing across a wide , grassy clearing . Behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like spilt water , blurring perfect seams of fuschia , tangerine , violet . He stops the truck , and they sit together in an odd , detective-type silence . <p> " Look . There they are . " <p> Gracefully he draws the rifle off her lap , rolls the window , pushes the barrel out , sighting . She does n't see a thing , then four deer swiftly bearing down on the truck , passing in an elegant , dreamy arc . He draws the rifle in . <p> " Does . Flushed out from those woods over there . " <p> " Do people shoot does ? " <p> " Last year one guy shot one from his truck , split her straight up the ass , got out , dragged her to the side of the road , took off . Idiot . Yeah , it happens . " <p> The sun is on the mountain , the grass , the barbed fences steadily brightening . <p> " What do we do now ? " <p> " Keep looking . Plus I 'll teach you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " God , I really do n't think I can do that . " But she feels shamed by the eerie , sickening wish in herself which he accepts as natural . <p> The truck grinds , crawls . Once in a while they pass hunters in other trucks and everyone waves , solemn , oathlike . She feels slightly bored , having imagined hunting as a sort of stalking through woods or crouching behind individual trees , not cruising in a truck , staring out dirt-crazed windows into greenish-black pools of trees and hazy stubble of oak , visually straining after a white flash of deer tail . <p> " Do they know ? The deer ? " <p> " That we 're looking for them ? You bet . They 'll stash under rock ledges , or go with the elk after elk season 's over . " <p> " All I know is so far we 've seen four does and entire herds of neutered beer cans . " <p> They start counting cans . By the time they get to a hundred on both sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sun on the center stripe the exact gold of fallen cottonwood leaves . Across the highway a tarnished brass meadow holds cattle in matted , blackened clumps . He heads the truck up another . forest service road , sunlight soaking the air , varnishing the sea-blue pines , hitting into flat red earth pocked with white stone . Out her opened window the air is thin and smells of turpentine . He stops , reads aloud an historic marker : 1540 , Coronado 's scouts . 1598 , colonists used this road to settle New Spain . El Camino Real . Oldest road in the United States of America . <p> " Let 's go up . I think my truck will make it . " <p> The dirt road , thin as a hall , this oldest road , is pilled and gouged with boulders . The truck shrieks up an increasingly precarious angle of ruts and clefts . Striking a partly submerged rock , it bucks , lists hideously to her side , stops . He yanks the brake , gets out , disappears by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You are not gon na believe ... " <p> " The tire came off ... " She 's joking . <p> His face comes up , a puppet in the stage of her window . " Correct . We 're thrown . " <p> They are now peculiarly stuck on the oldest road in the United . States of America . She helps as he calls for rocks to prop up the wrenched tire , directs him as he coasts the truck backward , downhill , swerving into a flat , weedy area , sits beside his camouflaged legs thrust from under the truck , leather boots sprawling up , hands him pliers , baling wire he hap-. pened to have . It 's the steering rod mechanism ; he 's seen one of his . uncles fix the same thing on his truck with wire and pliers . <p> " Did you know Hispanics buy parts cheap and can fix anything ? ' His voice muscles , cheerful , from under the truck . <p> " Nope . I did n't know that . " <p> " Cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything since we 're smart . There . That should get us back to town . " <p> Famished , cheerful , they eat everything in his pack . Ham , cheese , oranges , Cheezits , peanut butter , green apples . He army-knifes an orange in a zigzag design ... there , a flower , presenting one pretty half to her . Lays Cheezits on the rough mountain grass , one corner against another , a fiat formation of cracker butterflies . He shows her how to hold the Winchester , sight down the scope , pull back the trigger , shows her how to aim at an animal . A deer . <p> In the stifling truck , bumping cautiously , they pass a prim geometry of bicyclists in glistening black shorts , white helmets , colored flags snapping precisely . Her husband , Alan , is a bicycle racer . Competitive , ardent . She used to go to races with him , thinking at first how handsome he looked , later , how morose with competitive lust . Often he won . Her mind drifts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gigantic human heart you can walk into , pressing buttons to hear the heart talk , explain itself . Her daughters used to pull her in and out of that heart , over and over . Right now , she remembers this . <p> She spots it first , standing on the highway 's edge in the restrained , verdigris light of early evening , so utterly still as to make her think it is false . <p> " Oh God . " <p> He swerves the truck onto the gravel shoulder . " OK . Put your gun out the window , sight the way I showed you , and pull the trigger . " <p> " I ca n't . " <p> " Do it . Just the way I showed you . " <p> She sights , seeing it in the little scope , a wire-thin cross over the concealed heart . <p> She misses , hits the neck . The deer stumbles , regains itself , weakly runs . <p> " Go after it . I 'll find you . Go . Take the gun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed you . " <p> Comes upon it in a sparse grass clearing , collapsed , does n't understand whether to shoot or not . Dropping to her knees beside its head , she sees its antlers , white-tipped candelabra , the gorgeous eye fearful , her face miniaturized in its glazing surface . The breathing sounds hoarse , choppy , blood raveling from the earth-side of the mouth . Her own breathing alters , suffers . She feels coarse , reverent . As a child she 'd rehearsed small , sweet cruelties on pets ; now her daughters tenderly bully weaker creatures . She is exultant , stricken . <p> Standing above them , unsheathing his knife , he stoops to yank the deer so its exquisite head and sorrel neck slant downhill , slices the throat . Blood forming uneven collars around rocks , thickening , collecting , cherry red , stinking . Its eye open , hind legs kicking , still fleeing , tongue swelling between teeth . From the throat , a marbling flood of air and blood . <p> He sits on his boot heels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wait awhile for all the blood to drain . Want something . to drink ? " <p> She shakes her head . <p> " You all right ? " Reaches over , sets a blood hand on her shoulder . " You 're doing good . You feel sick ? Quite a few people get sick at first ; it 's nothing to be embarrassed about . Wait here ; I 'm going to the truck to get a soda . " <p> Seated in the company of death , blood thinning into arterial , stillexuberant rivers . She 's been reading a book about medieval Spanish nuns , their journals , poetry . Reading about nuns chronically , tyrannically bled to take out the devil 's afflictions . Affliction malefic in the blood . <p> Drinks his coke , takes his knife , cuts its testicles . <p> " You can turn these inside out to cover gearshift knobs . People do that , " he tells her . Hacks off what he calls " stinkers " from the ankles , removing anything that taints the meat . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two of his fingers and the knife cutting from the anus , the stomach left whole with its fermenting grasses , gutting to the throat . Opens its front legs , hauls out the esophagus , the lungs ripped from the ribcage , flung , grayish pink , into sunlight . Harvesting intestines with square , bloodied hands . Steam climbs out from the deer , and a stink from gases caught between ribs and intestines . Lungs , guts , all the deer 's arcane interior dumped out for scavenger birds  --  the deer 's dark , complex interior broken and humid junk . <p> He halves the heart , and she pours water from the red-and-white plastic jug , laving the heart like a great , dark , broken bowl . The rinsed halves slide off his hand into a plastic bag . Disk of flat , greenish liver , wine-colored kidneys , put with the heart , asa duras , he says . Delicious . His arms are brilliant red past the elbow . She floods water into the exposed cavity of deer , polishing the hollow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape of lowered head , the long hair , its curls like obsidian , with its bits of blue and red , the concentrated curve of spine , the deer 's wildness perished and gone into him . Inordinate blood , red haze on the evening , the gray , languorous guts , the smell . She plants her two arms into the deer , into its pearled wreathing of ribs , arms chinese red and thick smelling , her arms , her skin like his , purged of affliction . <p> He ropes the antlers and front feet together , and they drag the deer up through shrub to the road . Two hunters come by , help lift it into the truck bed . They speak Spanish and do not look at her , which she thinks is politeness , respect , or hostility . <p> When he cleans her arms with a strip of torn shirt , both of them look at her arms smeared with blood . She thinks she has never seen her arms before , not really , their freckled pinkness , narrow wrists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms , they embarrass her . She looks instead into his face ; his eyes focus on her nails , wiping tendrils of deer 's blood from the oval beds of her fingernails . <p> In the garage behind the house where he lives with his grandmother , aunt , and cousins , he uses rope to suspend the deer from a beam , begins to slice the hide , peel back the cape , exposing the meat . Like taking off tights , she thinks weirdly , obliquely , sitting on an old oil drum in one comer of the garage , eerily lit , like a bar , with one small ceiling bulb . A cousin comes out from the house to help ; she hears this cousin in Spanish say amor , nod towards her . She hears him on the other side of the deer laughing , saying no . She hears her husband 's name . <p> She is wondering how to interpret this place she has so idealistically moved to , the hacienda she and Alan will restore , the horses they will buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , embellished with huge clay pots of trailing pink geranium . Her Mexican coffee table with its precise arrangement of books on the Southwest , on southwestern interior design , on southwestern landscaping , on New Mexican history . She just purchased another expensive book on Spanish door and window designs . And yesterday she 'd purchased two ristras of lacquered chilies to hang on either side of the massive front door . And now , sitting on this oil drum in a small , cluttered garage , facing the stucco house he has grown up in , old cars thrown and dismembered around the dirt yard , the clothesline , with jeans , T-shirts , dishcloths neatly pinned . The deer hanging between the two young men in their worn shirts and jeans expertly dividing the deer from itself . <p> Outside the house , he rubs his arms under the hose , chipping the dry blood , the water gray , wintry . <p> " Would you like to have supper with us ? My aunt will want to cook the lomo , the part I told you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little brandy ; it 's excellent . " <p> " I should call home . " She had been going to say , " call my husband . " <p> " Oh , there 's no phone . We can go to my neighbor 's and call . " <p> " Well , no . I suppose I 'd better get home . " <p> " You sure ? Let me wrap some of the meat for you to take home to your family . " <p> She can not imagine her children , the little nuns , with hunks of deer meat in their roseate mouths . <p> She waits in his kitchen near the back door while he cuts the meat near the sink . The house is overly warm and smells of pine cleaning products . The TV is on in a room off the kitchen , and she hears the same news announcer she 'd listened to in her kitchen in Illinois . A cedar crucifix hangs above the clean , white sink . He wraps the foil , his hands careful . She notices how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There . Gracias a Dios . " He grins sweetly . " We always thank God when we receive a deer for food . " <p> Her heart , blocking her whole chest , keeps her from saying anything brittle or amusing . Back in his truck they bump out the little , rutted dirt driveway , sitting close because of the hunting equipment on her side . <p> " So . Did you enjoy your day ? " <p> " Oh , yes . Very much . " Dull , so stupid . She who is known for wit in crisis has gone aphasic . She can not breathe beside this man she scarcely knows . <p> " Do you mind if I hold your hand awhile ? " He says this , his hand already on hers . <p> They drive to her house , down the long , elm-lined driveway . The house , sprawling and huge , is dark . <p> She feels how close behind her he stands as she twists the key until the front door opens . She 's self-conscious about the ornamental ristras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen , unlacquered , used for cooking . <p> She reads Alan 's note , left on the kitchen table , while he opens the refrigerator , puts in the deer meat . <p> " Oh . They 've gone down to Albuquerque to see one of Alan 's bicycle friends . He says he 'll call in the morning  --  " <p> He had n't even signed the note to her . <p> The girls left drawings ; the oldest colored her in the pink prom dress , the youngest drew two heart heads , lopsided hearts with human features and stick bodies . <p> Perhaps there are times when one 's fate is predestined by those acts which came before , leading maplike to the present . During the long and irreversible span of devastation and betrayal to come , during the time when she would come to look upon her husband , her face the empty eye of the deer , she would ask over and over how she might have resisted , might have gone some uncomplicated , purer way . <p> And in those moments it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then guardian , purchasing her with beautiful eyes , with hands earlier gone inside the deer now opening her legs , hands now inside her , looking in a hard , bold , natural way no one had ever before looked upon her flesh , hands , body , eyes . In those moments her face surrendered its careful artifice , its years of artifice and pose , her face the deer she had killed , its spirit gone into his . So carefully placed as a vase upon the becalmed and lonely surface of her perfect life , so lonely , so careful , in her own life , doll in wife-clothes , doll in mother-clothes , doll in a pink dress , doll in camouflage , now so humbly naked , herself in a white bathtub in the ivory bathroom , an ivory candle in its dull brass holder on the watery ledge of the tub , his thick legs wedged against hers , his hands smoothing her back with ovals of soapy washcloth . No one since her mother had washed her back so tenderly , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentions the beauty of the deer , the finality of its death . The only death , until now , she has ever caused . <p> " But death is necessary for new life . La muerte es necesario para la vida nueva , " he says softly , rinsing her back with cupped hands , candlelight leafing her breasts and stomach , pulling her against him , showing how he cut and quartered the exquisite deer , his hands , callused and skillful , pushing her forward , her spine arching , slitting tender areas along the spine , cutting with the imaginary blade her cleansed , white skin . <p> She tries defending herself , the safe life she has built , but her humor is weak , lost in dangerous context , deeper feeling . <p> " So , are you done with killing the deer , and me as well ? " <p> By answer , lifting the water-heavy hair , dropping it along one shoulder , moving his lips down the damp , surrendered neck , with the ungovernable authority of love , the godlike affliction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
