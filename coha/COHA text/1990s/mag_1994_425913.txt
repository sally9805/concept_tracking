After a year of debate and division , a Presbyterian theologian explores what went wrong at last year 's controversial Re-Imagining conference . <p> The furor aroused by last year 's Re-Imagining conference exceeded in magnitude anything in memory of mainline Christianity . The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church ( U.S.A. ) , which met in Wichita last June , received more overtures of protest over Re-Imagining than on any topic in the denomination 's 200-plus-year history . Re-Imagining has awakened various mainline denominations to a state of crisis in theology , and with it the need , in the words of the Wichita general assembly , to assert that " theology matters . " <p> Indeed it does . If Re-Imagining stimulates mainline Protestants and Catholics to recover a responsible theology , guided by Scripture and creed , then it may play an important role in arresting the theological and moral drift so characteristic of mainline Christianity . If not , such events will signal the demise of the churches that support them . But to learn fully the lesson of Re-Imagining we must first be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  which can act as a case study of what goes wrong when we abandon Bible and creed as our moorings for guiding the work of the church . <p> More than 2,000 attendees from all 50 states and 28 countries gathered in Minneapolis from November 4-7 , 1993 , " as midwives of the new life that will be born from our tears and struggles , " in the words of an opening speaker . Three years in the planning , Re-Imagining was a global theological colloquium of feminist voices . Global , too , were its concerns : violence and war , racism , sexism , poverty , oppression , and economic injustice . These and other sources of tears and terror were addressed in moving pathos and acid iconodasm . Re-Imagining was a mega-event for body , mind , and spirit . In addition to 34 plenary addresses , there were small groups , workshops , ritual and worship , music , dance , plays , and visual arts . For the intrepid listener , it is captured in 24 double-sided cassettes  --  nearly 30 hours of recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially among mainline denominations  --  have equaled , if not exceeded , in magnitude anything in recent memory is not that the positions espoused were especially novel or more radical than feminist positions advanced in academic circles and literature . What distinguished Re-Imagining from myriad other similar events is that it not only claimed to speak to the church , but in certain respects for it . One-third of its attendees were clergy . Speaker after speaker called on the churches to undertake a new reformation of doctrine . And most significantly , the event bore the imprimatur of " The Ecumenical Decade : Churches in Solidarity with Women , 1988-1998 , " initiated by the World Council of Churches and funded by some 20 ecclesiastical organizations , including the Presbyterian Church ( U.S.A. ) ( PCUSA ) , the United Methodist Church , the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America ( ELCA ) , the American Baptist Convention ( ABC ) , the United Church of Christ , and four religious communities of Roman Catholics . <p> BREAKING TABOOS <p> Re-Imagining left no doubt that women 's issues are here for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony to the anger and alienation that often characterize the experience of women in the church . The sense of solidarity among women , particularly with the poor , oppressed , and those struggling for justice and equality , was particularly evident . Speakers were sharp in naming the powers that oppress and do violence to life . One could not remain unmoved by several voices of courage in the face of injustice . <p> One such voice was that of Violet Al Raheb , an Arab Lutheran living in Bethlehem ( Israel ) , whose description of the oppressive conditions facing Arab Christians in the birthplace of our Savior was particularly revealing . She appealed for an expansion of spirituality from a private and individual model to a communal model that practices solidarity with fellow believers , regardless of geopolitical factors . <p> Again , Rosario Batlle , a Mexican-Puerto Rican Presbyterian ( PCUSA ) currently at the United Evangelical Theological Seminary in Madrid ( Spain ) , told of her experience with African women who , through their study of the Bible , discovered the significance of women in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership in churches . She spoke of finding her identity in the cross of Christ , warned of a danger in feminist and liberation theologies to label opponents as enemies , and sought ways of liberating the truth of the gospel rather than redesigning it . <p> Unfortunately , these positions were exceptions at Re-Imagining . When Chung Hyun Kyung , professor in theology at Ewha Women 's University in Seoul , South Korea , mounted the podium , she announced , " A white Christian brother gave me an apple . " Chung then took a bite from the Edenic apple and , with cheers from the audience , asked , " What taboo have you broken today ? " A bit sophomoric , perhaps , Chung 's gesture nevertheless typified the spirit of subversion that permeated Re-Imagining , frequently in crude and irreverent expressions . <p> Arguing for a re-emphasis on the Spirit and a de-emphasis on Jesus , Delores Williams , professor of theology and culture at Union Seminary ( N.Y. ) , spoke of the Incarnation as " the Spirit mounting Mary . " Decrying the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the created world and its institutions between human being and God , " Johanna Bos , Presbyterian ( PCUSA ) professor of Old Testament at Louisville Theological Seminary , , concluded , " We are not here to join the great pissing contest . " <p> Nadine Addington introduced Susan Thistlethwaite , United Church of Christ professor of theology at Chicago Theological Seminary , by quoting Thistlethwaite 's conversion to feminism : " I started to pray aloud , ' O Father , ' and I stopped . ' O Brother , ' and I waited . And then I said , ' O s  --  . ' " <p> Melanie Morrison , cofounder of CLOUT ( Christian Lesbians Out Together ) , said , " I know in my heart that the canon is not closed , it is open . I know this because the Bible does not reconcile me with the earth and the Bible does not reconcile me with my sexual self . " Morrison later delivered a lesbian altar call as a background chorus sang , " Keep on moving forward . . . never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morrison ) of CLOUT and lesbian evangelist for the Downtown Presbyterian Church of Rochester ( N.Y. ) , claimed her theology was first of all informed by " making love with Coni , " her lesbian partner . <p> The flaunting of such vulgarisms and sacrileges at Re-Imagining dispels the notion that they were aberrations from the agenda . They were calculated to represent it . No less disturbing were the cheers , applause , and occasional banging on tables that followed such spicy decisions . Most distressing , however , was an undisguised intolerance for other viewpoints , which belied the spirit of inclusivity , diversity , and nonviolence that was touted as the feminine way . No male voice was heard in four days of the conference ( only 83 men attended ) , and never was heard an encouraging word about the masculine gender . <p> The most uncharitable accusations were targeted for the two whipping boys of liberalism , the Roman Catholic hierarchy and " fundamentalism . " Among various aspersions , the Roman Catholic hierarchy was denounced by Beverly Harrison , United Methodist professor of Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pedophile capital of the world . " Fundamentalism , raked with malice and misunderstanding , was maligned as a movement rooted in fear , alienation , and the desire to deprive others of life . <p> IS THEOLOGY MERELY POETRY ? <p> Re-Imagining was a carefully orchestrated event in which various patterns emerged that typified most , if not all , its speakers and liturgies . Its broad outlines can perhaps be captured in four angles of vision , the first of which is Re-Imagining 's understanding of the nature of theology . <p> At the opening session , Mary Bednarowski , professor of religious studies at United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities ( Minn. ) , said , " We have come together from many parts of the world to re-imagine our religious traditions . " Not only does our Christian tradition have " the resilience , the inexhaustible resources , and the creativity to sustain a re-imagining of its most central symbols , " she continued , but the task of re-imagining them was incumbent upon those present . Similarly , Rosario Batlle spoke of theology as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The characterization of theology as symbol or as poetic image was critical to the theological experimentation of Re-Imagining . A symbol or poetic image is like an abstract painting to which any number of meanings can be assigned , depending on the subjective impression of the viewer . No meaning can claim to be definitive or to exclude other and quite contrary meanings . If theological statements ( for example , " we are justified by grace through faith " ) are essentially symbolic in nature , then they are , like various explanations put forth for the origin of the universe , for example , simply models of human under-standings ; or worse , like the assigning of a telephone number to a given address , they are arbitrary designations . If such is the case , then we arc , of course , free to change the model or the number when doing so serves specific interests . This was the position advanced at Re-Imagining . <p> The Christian tradition is united in affirming , however , that theological statements are not primarily symbolic but descriptive  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realities . For example , the statement " Michelangelo was a creative artist " claims to assert something true of Michelangelo , something that can not be discarded without distortion or destruction of the truth to which it testifies . The validity , of the assertion is not determined by what it may evoke in the one who makes it , which is the case with symbols and poetic images . <p> The theology of the church is like this . It strives to define ( even if it is incapable of doing so perfectly ) what is the saying core or kerygma of the gospel . Theology is not , as was bemoaned at Re-Imagining , something to " fence us in , " " tie us up , " " or justify male domination , " but to identify , declare , and preserve the way of salvation . Hence , as Paul taught , we are responsible " to the form of teaching to which you were entrusted " ( Rom. 6 : 17 , NRSV ) . The truth claims of the gospel are not our claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apostles ' and the church 's . The responsibility of the church vis-a-vis those claims is not to re-imagine them , but to discover their significance for each generation and to transmit them . Sound doctrine is not a corral that confines but a map that directs to the goal of salvation , or , to use another metaphor , a set of harbor buoys that show the navigable passages between God and humanity . <p> IS ONE GOD ENOUGH ? <p> A second hallmark of Re-Imagining was its understanding of God . It is not possible to identify a single prevailing view of God , for syncretism , polytheism , pantheism , and monism were all in evidence . But one thing was clear : the Triune God of Bible and creed was roundly circumvented . <p> Anne Primavesi , a " research theologian " from Dublin , Ireland , asked , " Is one God enough ? " The primary expression of God , according to her reading of Genesis , is creation itself , from which she derived a nature mysticism . Only later , she claimed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and trees limited to the word of revelation , " narrowed down , down , down until it becomes solely the revelation of Jesus Christ . " In the voice of Moses the law-giver , this confining revelation became the voice of male domination , coercive over the whole creation . Like Marcion and the Gnostics of the early church , Primavesi drew a sharp distinction between the God of creation and the God of redemption . But unlike Marcion , whose creator Demiurge was a base and inferior God , Primavesi 's creator God is superior to the God revealed in Jesus Christ . God is hence supremely incarnated in earth rather than in Jesus . The catechism , she pronounced , should read , " One God is not enough ! " <p> Elizabeth Bettenhausen , ELCA coordinator of the Study/Action Program at the Women 's Theological Center in Boston , condemned the doctrine of creatio ex nibilo as a boring doctrine , indeed , a violent act of male autonomy " that is downright dangerous for women 's lives . " The references to God in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only " to remind us , probably inadvertently , of the goddess and the earth from which he came . " The audience was directed to pantheism over transcendence , to a spirituality of creation . <p> Even more than pantheism , however , a rampant syncretism characterized Re-Imagining . Chung Hyun Kyung , the apple-eater , described herself in these words : " My bowel is Shamanist , my heart is Buddhist , my right brain is Confucianist , and my left brain is Christian . " A world parliament of religions reduced to one , Chung introduced her three special goddesses : Kali , the Hindu goddess of destruction ; Quani , a Buddhist goddess who prays for the abolition of hell ; and Enna , a Philippine earth goddess . " These , " she exclaimed , " are my new Trinity . " This is , of course , simply a tri-theism , but it was nevertheless the extent of Trinitarian theology at Re-Imagining . <p> An opening naming ritual was introduced thus : " The naming of our God is a sacred act . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of his self-disclosure , as " Yahweh " at Sinai , but preeminently as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ . At Re-Imagining , the audience was invited to supply its own names for God : divine ancestor , mother God , lover , alpha and omega , fire of love , she who is eternal , Sophia , earth mother , spirit woman , cosmic maxim , ninjan , womb of creation , prime mover , and yin and yang . Jesus Christ was not named . <p> The process of amalgamation was furthered by Kwok Pui-Lan , Chinese professor of theology at Episcopal Divinity School ( Cambridge , Mass . ) . Appealing at points to the superiority of Confucianism and Mahayana Buddhism over Christianity , Kwok argued that assigning a referent to " God " was inherently irrational . The concepts of sin and guilt in Christianity were dismissed . " O Jesus , " she said , " who are you that reconciles us to God ? Who is this funny God ? Who needs to be reconciled with him ? " She argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of the HIV Thai prostitutes is now God 's incarnate among us , " she claimed . Again , Jesus has been reincarnated in the endangered environment , specifically as a fig tree . " If we can not image Jesus as a tree , as a river , as wind , and as rain , " she said , " we are doomed together . If we are forever anthropocentric in our search for the redeemer , we are doomed . " <p> If there was a baseline God of Re-Imagining , it was the God of Mercy Amba Oduyoye , a Ghanian theologian : " The one God of many names , " she said , " is the God of all creation . " Never mind that the concept of God differs radically in the world 's religions , and that to say everything is of God is to say nothing at all . We are again at a theology of abstraction , the inevitable result of forsaking the doctrine of revelation for a theology built purely from below . Whether Aristotle 's Prime Mover or Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " God " becomes the ideal backdrop , in the words of Feuerbach , upon which we may project our own idiosyncrasies . At Re-Imagining the result was a decisive shift away from a salvation procured for us by the work of God in Jesus Christ to a salvation potential within creation . The doctrine of redemption , with its call for repentance and promise of transformation of self and society , was supplanted by a theology of immanence in which the distinction between God and the world was blurred or eliminated . What is , either is God , or is what God intended it to be . <p> WHATEVER HAPPENED TO JESUS ? <p> A third characteristic of Re-Imagining was its perspective on Jesus Christ . As a rule , presentors spoke from their own experiences and contexts , and this lent a particularity to each story . Barbara Lundblad , pastor of Our Savior 's Atonement Lutheran Church in New York City , alluded to the story of Jesus writing on the ground in John 8 and encouraged women " to write a word that has not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Re-Imagining , but the story of Jesus was not told . <p> It was not an oversight . On the second day of the conference , Lundblad announced euphorically , " Some authority would call our worship of last night verging on heresy . We did not last night name the name of Jesus . Nor have we done anything in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Spirit . " Applause and cheers followed . In the 49 songs , chants , liturgies , and prayers contained in the Re-Imagining program book , the name of Christ appears twice ; Jesus , only once ( in an African-American spiritual ) . No prayer was addressed to Jesus , and none ended in his name ( with the exception of an untranslated Amerindian prayer ) . " Amazing Grace " appears in the program with the caveat , " We will hum this piece without text . " Talking circles were addressed to God , the Spirit , community , and the Minnesota Harvest Festival  --  but not to Jesus . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sanctions for violence and oppression . Typical of many speakers was Delores Williams , who announced , " We have a whole different notion of incarnation . " The first incarnation , she argued , took place not in Jesus but in the Spirit 's visitation of Mary . The significance of Jesus for Williams consisted in the example of his life as " an ancestor-friend God . " But he did not conquer sin on the cross . " I do n't think we need a theory of atonement at all . I do n't think we need folks hanging on crosses and blood dripping and weird stuff . " For Williams , " the Spirit rather than Jesus tells us who God is . " Likewise , Ingeline Neilsen , Swiss musicologist and missionary to Zimbabwe , condemned the hymn " Lift High the Cross " as an example of an oppressive view of God . For Virginia Ramey Mollenkott , professor of English at William Patterson College ( N.J. ) , the cross symbolizes God as an abusive parent . The Atonement is " wild theology that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14:6 affirms that Jesus " is the way , and the truth , and the life . " Re-Imagining attested to many ways , truths , and lives . Jesus was not the definitive revealer of God and reconciler of humanity to God . He was , rather , one of various avatars , or manifestations , of God . For Mollenkott , Jesus is simply an elder brother , companion , and trail-blazer , one among many siblings who shows us how to live in oneness with the divine source . <p> Nowhere was the offense against the central figure of Christian faith more blatant than in the concluding worship event . Preaching on the story of the Canaanite woman ( Matt. 15:21-28 ) , Christine Smith , professor of preaching and worship at United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities ( Minn. ) , presented the Canaanite woman as heroine and Jesus as villain , pleading for a world in which there is no begging , no humiliation , and no crumbs . In a Holy Communion look-alike entitled " Blessing over Milk and Honey , " the worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience in libidinal antiphony : " With the hot blood of our wombs we give form to new life . . . With the milk of our breasts we suckle the children . . . With nectar between our thighs we invite a lover , we birth a child ; With our warm body fluids we remind the world of its pleasures and sensations . " There was no mention of Jesus or his atoning sacrifice . The Song of Solomon was neatly substituted for Golgotha , eros for pathos , leaving no trace of the One who gave his life for the redemption of the world . <p> It is perhaps one thing to espouse such views from a podium where the audience is granted autonomy over against a presenter . But worship on the Lord 's Day ( read : Sophia 's Day ) is a more serious matter , for there the audience is transformed into a worshiping congregation . With the " Blessing over Milk and Honey " the mask was off Re-Imagining : it was , as more than one speaker attested , an evangelical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worship . One wonders how the clergy present could participate without violating their ordination vows . <p> IS SOPHIA GOD ? <p> The role of divine revealer denied to Jesus at Re-Imagining was filled by Sophia . " Bless Sophia , dream the vision , share the wisdom , dwelling deep within " echoed some two-dozen times through Re-Imagining like the Gloria Patti in a Benedictine monastery . There are , to be sure , passages in the Old Testament that personify sophia ( Greek for wisdom ) , and on occasion speak of her as an attribute of divine activity ( see " In the name of Sophia , " p. 43 ) . At Re-Imagining , however , no speaker addressed the role of sophia within the biblical or theological tradition , and particularly the Eastern Orthodox tradition where it has played a significant role . Sophia , rather , was presented in unspecified relationship to the Christian tradition , independent and even alien to it . <p> Ostensibly , Sophia was intended to represent a feminine expression of the Holy Spirit , but in reality , Sophia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to the place of God . The practical result was that Sophia became a subjective metaphor for the political , social , gender , sexual , or ecological preferences of various speakers . We have noted the shift in theological authority at Re-Imagining from transcendence to immanence . That is , theology was severed from its traditional moorings in the transcendence of God , the person and work of Christ , the institution of the church , and the Holy Scriptures , and rooted to human experience alone  --  a tendency , incidentally , increasingly characteristic of many modern theologies . Any distinction between the " Spirit " and human experience was effectively eliminated , thus positing ultimate authority in human experience , which , at Re-Imagining , meant feminine experience . <p> The endeavor to shift theology from dogmatic to experiential categories verged on spiritual narcissism . " I reverence the Presence within you , " began an opening liturgy , after which participants were instructed , " Whisper the sacred word that is your name . " Several speakers alluded to the divine within them . Aruna Gnanadason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her forehead as a symbol of the divine in her . Chung Hyun Kyung of Korea spoke of spirituality as an archaeological excavation of the layers of God within her . Barbara Lundblad took the messianic prophecy of Isaiah 61 , which Jesus applied uniquely to himself in Luke 4 , and applied it to herself : " The Spirit has anointed me . I need to know that this word is spoken to me in the spirit of Sophia . Trust the stirring in your womb . " <p> The problem with locating theological authority in human experience is that human experience varies , making an objective standard impossible . In the name of Jesus Christ , the Ku Klux Klan , " German Christians " under Hitler , and the death-to-abortionists faction have advocated things that Christians  --  including Christians at Re-Imagining  --  abhor . The authority of human experience leads to the oldest and most violent ethic in the world : might makes right . <p> Thc equating of the Spirit with human experience at Re-Imagining resulted in elevating " the evil of patriarchy " to mythic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stereotype of Re-imagining that " subhuman " fulfills for the Fascist and " capitalism " for the Communist . In a story narrated by Aruna Gnanadason , patriarchy replaced sin as the source of all evil in the world . Man seized the demon of patriarchy to brutalize the creation , including woman , his innocent victim . The church , with its " brain-damaging theology , " sanctions the present state of oppression . There is only one thing patriarchy can not stamp out , however . That is the feminine spirit , compassionate and regenerating , which will ultimately prevail . <p> Gnanadason 's mythic archetype might have been dismissed as a theological melodrama were it not echoed in Dirty Harry-epithets from speaker after speaker . One was left blinking in incredulity at such a simplistic  --  and self-righteous  --  world-view . But the show went on . Most of the fallout from the blast on patriarchy landed in the lap of the church . A male-dominated clearing house of power over women , the church became the object of all sorts of drive-by shootings from speakers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a viable community of faith . Virginia Mollenkott made it explicit when she advised that " it may be necessary for the substantial liberated minority in every denomination to leave the denomination in order to form the holistic church . " <p> Re-Imagining 's theology of immanence came to most explicit elaboration in sexual imagery . Susan Thistlethwaite declared , " Sexuality is to feminism what work is to Marxism . " The motif pervaded Re-Imagining at every level . It was most apparent in the default apology for lesbianism , homosexuality , transgenderism , and bisexuality that characterized Re-Imagining . Not a few speakers identified themselves as lesbian . Decrying " the unspeakable treatment of lesbian and bisexual women in mainline churches , " Mary Hunt , Roman Catholic feminist of the Women 's Alliance for Theology , Ethics and Ritual ( WATER ) in Silver Spring ( Md. ) , stated , " To be an out lesbian in Christian church circles is to live threatened with spiritual if not physical death . " Quoting Mollenkott that " grace is a lesbian , " Hunt urged breaking with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggage of patriarchy . " " People doing justice for homosexual rights . . . is what it means to mc to be religious . Whether it is Christian or not is frankly , darling , something about which I no longer give a pope . " <p> An appeal for consensual sexual acts followed in consort with the affirmation of lesbianism . " Imagine sex among friends as the norm , " continued Mary Hunt , " young people learning to make friends rather than to date . Imagine valuing genital sexual interaction in terms of whether or how it fosters friendship and pleasure . . . . Pleasure is our birthright . " <p> THE JUDGMENT OF HULDAH <p> Re-Imagining gave voice to the pain and alienation that many women experience in the church . Christians , especially those who affirm Galatians 3:28 , for example , should hear such pain with a renewed commitment to the equality of women as coheirs of salvation and as complementary partners in the church . But Re-Imagining was not the way to go about it , as has been recognized from many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way theology is done , the nature of God , the significance of the Incarnation , and the person of the Holy Spirit poses a theological danger that the church can not ignore if it is to remain the church . <p> The steering committee and various denominational leaders have labeled critics of Re-Imagining as divisive and factious . A postconference communique warned that " Unofficial conservative publications within . . . denominations have attacked the conference as heretical and pagan . " The attempt to deflect responsibility with words like unofficial and conservative is a lame ad hominem . That is like accusing doctors of jeopardizing health for attacking illness , or the police of disrupting communities because they prosecute crime . What other word besides heresy is appropriate where the Incarnation and Trinity were dismissed , where orthodoxy was derided , where Scripture was repeatedly contradicted , and where a goddess named Sophia was actively promoted ? It is not those who name heresy who divide the church , but those who practice it ! <p> In conclusion , 2 Kings 22 preserves a judgment that is of significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were undertaken on the temple . " The book of the Law " ( Deuteronomy ) was discovered and read before the king , who directed the prophetess Huldah to be consulted , " for great is the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us . " Huldah 's interpretation did nothing to allay the king . " Behold , I will bring evil upon this place and its inhabitants , " said the prophetess . Johanna Bos interpreted Huldah 's prophecy as a condemnation of male domination of the temple , fulminating , " This old house of patriarchy has got to come down . " <p> That is a decidedly idiosyncratic interpretation . Huldah 's prophecy is not about male domination or patriarchy . It is about apostasy and idolatry , the very things that characterized Re-Imagining . " Because they have forsaken me and have burned incense to other gods , . . . therefore my wrath will be kindled against this place " ( 2 Kings 22:17 ) . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> By JAMES R.
