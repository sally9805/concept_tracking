<p> I have a confession : I used to suffer from slabophobia . The thought of cooking ribs on a grill left me slathered with dread . I could handle chicken , steaks , swordfish fillets - but ribs , with all those bones and odd-looking nobs of cartilage , were best left to people willing to blow $ 500 on a smoker and spend half their weekends discussing the finer points of smoke penetration . <p> Last winter , though , I had to learn a lot about ribs in a hurry . I was co-writing a cookbook on barbecue sauces with Susan Puckett , the Journal-Constitution 's executive food editor , and had to help test more than 100 recipes , more than a few of them involving ribs . While others stuffed turkeys for the holidays , I was out on the deck trying this baste or that dry rub on slab after slab . Through many hours of tending a $ 50 water smoker , I conquered my slabophobia - and learned to cook pretty good ribs . <p> Remember that photo of Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most likely gnawing on ribs by Ol ' Hawg 's Breath , a Memphis cook-off ensemble that teams up with the Washington Pigskinners , the crew the Gores have been known to join during Memphis in May .
