<p> To show the kind of swell fellow I am , that I am perfectly capable of forgiving and forgetting and never holding a grudge against my fellow man , even when the man in question is n't always a man and actually is one of the bigger creeps ever to put his feet inside a pair of sneakers , let me say something I never thought I 'd say . <p> Dennis Rodman should be on the All-Star team . <p> With that endorsement , he 'll probably make me look moronic now , such as planting two more corn rows through Allen Iverson 's brain tonight . Or asking Dee Kantner and Violet Palmer to play strip poker with him , right on the court . Always , there is the possibility our All-Star could go All-Starks and disintegrate . We 'll just have to take that chance . <p> Because to date , for the first time since he wigged out years ago in Detroit , Rodman has behaved himself with enough consistency to let us see through the Clairol kaleidoscope and gonzo act and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has let us marvel at the rebounding fool  --  going on 37 , still the finest inch-for-inch , pound-for-pound retriever of missed shots in NBA history . He has let us understand his importance to the Bulls as a high-energy force . And better yet , by staying out of the league clink , Rodman has let us see what an effective leader he can be by putting aside the little gargoyles in his head , realizing Michael Jordan needed help through the Scottie Pippen saga and channeling his petulant impulses in productive ways . <p> Yes , those are gargantuan statements . When Jordan pipes in with a sincere opinion that Worm , so far , is " the MVP of our team , " you start to feel faint . But impossible as it all seems , it 's all true . With zero suspensions , zero ejections and only two flagrant fouls and seven technical fouls  --  three behind league leader and perennial All-Star Karl Malone  --  Rodman finally has managed a feat the rest of us experience around age 13 : He is beginning to grow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of a lithium ejection . That distinction belongs to Mike Tyson or Latrell Sprewell . Heck , he has n't even been the primary distraction on his own team . <p> What he is now , first and foremost , is an excellent player , undeniably one of the dozen best in the Eastern Conference . Still , there is a problem , a major hangup that could prevent Rodman from playing in his first All-Star Game since 1992 . I may be in the mood to pardon him , but what about the 15 conference coaches who will vote and determine his fate ? Not to mention the influence of league commissioner David Stern and sheriff Rod Thorn ? In the past , the league and coaches were right to blackball Rodman because of his thug tactics and despicable stunts . Is their disgust level still so high they will keep him out again , make him pay for his past by purposely punishing him when he deserves the honor most ? <p> It 's possible , as his public defender acknowledges . " I do n't think Dennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it hurts me to say it , " Phil Jackson said . " I think people are prejudiced aganst him . " <p> Some have good reason to be . At least five Eastern coaches , if they so desired , might be compelled to omit him based on verbal swipes he 's taken at them . If you 're Jeff Van Gundy , and Rodman said the Knicks ca n't win because you 're a lousy coach , would you vote for him ? If you 're Larry Bird , and Rodman said you 're just an average coach ( after characterizing you as " another white guy " during your legendary playing career ) , would you vote for him ? If you 're Rick Pitino , and Rodman made fun of the fast-paced style you 're employing during a fine first season in Boston , would you vote for him ? If you 're Pat Riley or Mike Fratello , why do any favors for a recovering jerkoholic ? After hearing his nonsense and decrying his tactics forever , why would they exonerate Rodman now , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doses ? <p> At least two coaches , Atlanta 's Lenny Wilkens and Detroit 's Doug Collins , have been so bold as to say they 'll vote for Rodman . " I do n't think what he 's done in the past should be used against him , " Wilkens said . " I believe he should be judged by what he does on the court this season . " <p> " I 'm going to vote for him , " Collins said . " He 's been great . There has n't been any of that side stuff . " <p> Jerry Krause , whose insistence on huge economic incentives in Rodman 's contract is contributing to his good behavior , hopes other coaches opt for similar rationality . " There 's not a player at that position that has given more to his team to this point than Dennis , " he said . " The performance alone merits it , but his conduct has been exemplary . I 'm proud of him . I would hope the coaches look at it and say , ' Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he belongs . ' The coaches know who 's playing well and who 's not . There 's no question in my mind he should be there . " <p> Certainly , there is question in Stern 's mind . He is a big enough man not to care that Rodman made him look foolish last year , ridiculing him during the head-butting suspension . What concerns Stern is succumbing to Rodman and then seeing him resort to the same old antics  --  all while the game is showcased in New York , image capital of sports . Rather than risk the return of the crazyman , might Stern want to showcase younger players in the Madison Avenue setting ? <p> With Grant Hill and Shawn Kemp far ahead in fan voting as the East 's starting forwards , expect three reserves to be named at that position . Glen Rice , reigning All-Star MVP , has played exclusively at small forward for Charlotte and deserves a berth . It 's conceivable the coaches could ignore Rodman and select two of the following four : New Jersey 's Jayson Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mount Carmel whiz who recently had a 49-point game ; Washington 's Chris Webber , whose stats are up and whose team has a new identity in a new arena ; and Milwaukee 's Glenn Robinson , a Big Dog again instead of a bow-wow . <p> For Rodman , I would argue these points : He will lead the league in rebounding for the seventh straight season , he helped maintain the Bulls ' status as favorites during Pippen 's absence and he has made more impact in his team 's success than any of the others have . Also , Williams is more a center than a power forward . <p> True to his cool , Rodman expresses indifference . While Chicago makes his case and sweats out the Jan. 27 announcement , he already has his Vegas flight for the All-Star break . " Who cares ? I know I do n't care if I make the All-Star team , " he said . " If I make it , great . If not , it 's not going to stop me from what I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have some fun . It does n't impress me at all to make the All-Star Game . <p> " I 've been doing it for seven years . Why would they put me on the team now ? I do n't want to lobby for it . I want to be in there because they think , hey , I deserve to be there . " <p> He claims not to care , but he does . Deep beneath the hair dye , Dennis Rodman always has craved acceptance more than he has let on . This time , if only this time , he deserves our support . <p> Until he shows up for the game in the nude . <p> Jay Mariotti 's radio program airs from 8 a.m. to noon Saturdays and Sundays on 950-AM.
