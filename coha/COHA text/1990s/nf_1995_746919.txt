Introduction <p> Cancer is thought to result from an accumulation of some inherited and/or acquired genetic lesions in previously normal cells . Molecular genetics has provided evidence that loss or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes is an important step in carcinogenesis. 1 , 2 The nuclear phosphoprotein  | , the product of a tumor suppressor gene located at 17p , has specific DNA binding and transcriptional capabilities. 3 Some mutations of  | are associated with prolonged protein half-life and this can often be detected by immunohistochemistry. 2 Mutations in the  | tumor suppressor gene have been shown by different methods in human laryngeal carcinoma. 4-7 <p> The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of  | overexpression in squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx ( SCCL ) by immunohistochemistry and to associate this finding with clinicopathological features and prognosis . Materials and Methods <p> Clinical Specimens <p> The study sample consisted of 51 cases of carcinoma of the larynx with a minimum follow-up period of 36 months , obtained from the files of Ankara University , Ibn-i Sina Hospital , between January 1985 and January 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumor-positive resection margins were not included in this study . The patients were divided into two groups according to three-year disease-free survival . The clinical stage at the time of diagnosis was also evaluated in two groups : early ( T1-T2 ) and advanced ( T3-T4 ) stages . In addition , cases were divided into two groups according to tumor location ; glottic or supraglottic . All T1 and T2 cases had been treated with supraglottic horizontal laryngectomy and all T4 cases with total laryngectomy . T3 patients had been treated either with supraglottic or total laryngectomy depending upon the pre-epiglottic space involvement . <p> Histopathological Study <p> The specimens had been fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin . Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were examined to confirm the original histopathological diagnosis and to determine the histological parameters . Tumors were divided into well , moderately and poorly differentiated groups ( grade 1 , 2 and 3 respectively ) , depending upon the degree of keratin pearl formation and intercellular bridges . Nuclear atypia was also determined on a three-grade scale . Mitotic activity was evaluated by counting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , 2 and 3 corresponded to 0-5 mitoses/10 HPF , 6-15 mitoses/10HPF , more than 15 mi-roses/10 HPF , respectively . Tumor-associated tissue eosinophilia ( TATE ) was subjectively graded as 1 , 2 or 3 . Lymphoplasmocytic host inflammatory response was also assessed similarly and desmoplasia in the stroma was evaluated as either present or absent . <p> Immunohistochemistry <p> One paraffin block from the primary site was selected for immunohistochemical analysis for each case . Sections 4-6 mm in thickness were taken from the blocks on polylysin-coated slides . A monoclonal mouse antibody against  | protein ( Novacastra UK , DO7 ) was applied in 1:75 dilution . The conventional streptavidin-biotin method was used . Colorization was performed with the diaminobenzydin ( DAB ) method . Brown precipitates seen within the nucleus confirmed the presence of the  | . The number of positive tumor cells varied among cases . Each section was evaluated by four pathologists individually to determine the percentage of positive cells by counting 500 tumor cells . The percentage of the positive cells was estimated for each case by finding the average of the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four pathologists collectively when there was a discrepancy of more than 20% between the observations of any two or more of the four observers . The results of the immunohistochemical study were tabulated into three groups : a ) completely absent or less than 5% , b ) 5 to 40% , c ) more than 40% . Histopathologic and immunohistochemical evaluations were performed blinded to the clinical factors . Results <p> The relationships between  | staining and clinicopathological features were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests . Characteristics of 51 cases are summarized in Table 1 . Of 51 patients , 39 ( 76% ) had a three-year disease-free survival and 12 ( 24% ) had metastases , recurrence or died from the disease in the first three years . The patients were concentrated in advanced stages ( T3-T4:80% ) and the majority of the tumors were in the supraglottic location ( 84% ) . On histological examination , 43% of the tumors were found to be moderately differentiated while 37% and 10% of the tumors were well and poorly differentiated , respectively . Nuclear atypia was usually moderate ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was usually low ( 55% , grade 1 ) . TATE was not prominent in most cases ( 57% , grade 1 ) and lymphoplasmocytic infiltration was usually moderate ( 57% , grade 1 ) . Desmoplasia was not observed in 75% of the cases . In 32 cases ( 63% )  | staining was observed ( Figure 1 ) . Staining was generally more prominent in the nuclei of the peripheral cells in the tumor islands , and in some sections patchy positivity was observed . In 26 of the 51 cases there was non-neoplastic mucosa on the same slide , and in four of these sections ,  | staining was observed in dysplastic or " normal looking " epithelium ( Figure 2 ) . Staining was limited to basal layers of non-neoplastic epithelium and one of these four cases tumor cells did not show  | positivity while  | expression was observed in neoplastic cells along with non-neoplastic epithelium in three cases . No significant relationship between  | staining and prognosis or any other of the aforementioned clinicopathological parameters was observed by the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests ( Table 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to determine the incidence of  | overexpression in SCCL and to assess its correlation with prognosis and clinicopathological features . In this study 63% of the tumors showed positive immunostaining for  | . This observation compares favorably with the results from other studies on head and neck carcinomas with findings that vary between 20 and 81%. 4 , 7-10 Missense mutations of  | are associated with prolonged protein half-life which enables the immunohistochemical detection of  | mutations . However , immunohistochemical detection of  | mutations may lead to false-positive and false-negative results for several reasons . 11 This technique probably misses about one-third of  | lesions that express little or no protein. 3 Furthermore , the patchy staining pattern observed in some sections implies the possibility of missing positively staining cells by a limited number of sections in a given tumor . Hence , the real incidence of  | mutations may be even higher than that in our observations . <p> In this study , we observed  | overexpression in normal looking or dysplastic mucosa in four cases . This observation parallels the findings of Boyle et al that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesions was 19% by direct sequencing. 12 Although  | positivity was not observed in neoplastic cells in one case , it may be possible to encounter positivity in other sections from the same tumor . As emphasized by some authors , we believe that observation of  | overexpression in otherwise normal or dysplastic mucosa suggests the early involvement of the  | gene in carcinogenesis. 4 <p> Our results showed that there was no statistically significant association between the level of expression of  | and three-year disease-free survival . Although correlation between  | and prognosis has been reported , 13 , 8 most researchers were unable to link  | statistically with survival. 4 , 7 In addition , we did not observe any relationship between  | immunoreactivity and clinicopathological parameters such as tumor stage , differentiation , atypia and mitiotic activity , which are important indicators of biological behavior . Furthermore ,  | was found to be unrelated to host responses such as TATE , lymphoplasmocytic infiltration and stromal desmoplasia in this study . There are some reports confirming our observation of the lack of correlations between  | staining and clinicopathological features. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observations suggest that although  | is important in carcinogenesis of SCCL , level of expression does not significantly effect prognosis and is of no value as a prognostic indicator . In fact , tumors that are found to be  | negative by immunohistochemical methods may possess undetectable mutations of the  | gene , or other oncogenes may have been involved , leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation . Summary <p> The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of  | overexpression in squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx and to establish whether or not this bore any relationship to survival , location , stage , histological differentiation , nuclear atypia , mitotic activity , stromal desmoplasia , tumor-associated tissue eosinophilia , or stromal lymphoplasmocytic infiltration . <p> Paraffin blocks from 51 cases of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma with a minimum follow-up period of 36 months were recut and stained immunohistologically with anti- antibody using the streptavidin-biotin technique . Results were compared with clinicopathological features with Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests . <p> Sixty-three percent of tumors showed positive staining for  | , and in addition , 15% of the sections with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship between  | staining and prognosis or any other one of the aforementioned clinicopathological parameters was observed . <p> Although  | overexpression is a common feature in laryngeal carcinomas , it does not seem to have an impact on prognosis and it does not bear any relationship to the aforementioned clinicopathological parameters . <p> Presented at the meeting of " Fourth Research Workshop on the Biology , Prevention and Treatment of Head and Neck Cancer , " Arlington , Virginia , September 11,1994 . <p> Reprint requests to : Gursel Dursun , Mesnevi Sokak 11/3 , **27;128;TOOLONG ; Phone : 90-312-438-77-87 ; Fax : 90-312-310-63-71 . <p> Table 1 .
