Prepare yourselves for hypervelocity , rifles and scopes designed as a unit , and other wonders . // MUCH OF THIS ISSUE IS ABOUT what hunting is going to be like in the foreseeable future , so it seems reasonable to ask what our rifles are going to be like . I doubt if we 'll be using phasers anytime soon , but who knows ? If you had told me 20 years ago that I 'd be writing with the aid of something called a mouse , I 'd have said no thanks , I do n't do rodents , and smacked you smartly upside the head . So with the full knowledge that the following may come back to haunt me in my golden years ... AESTHETICS What will rifles look like ? Probably they wo n't change a lot , because shooters are an extremely conservative bunch , and they wo n't accept anything radically different . The military , which is not constrained by this fact , has been building highly unconventional-looking rifles for some time , and they work extremely well . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the idiocy that we 've seen in Great Britain and Australia spreads here ( i.e. , autos are the cause of crime , so they 're banned ) , this influence may be negated . We can expect more space-age materials , including titanium barrels and receivers , and some bright soul is going to design a rifle and optical sighting device as a single unit ; no more scopes to mount . On the other hand , gun guru Jeff Cooper predicted this 40 years ago , and it still has n't happened , but it probably will . HYPERVELOCITY For most of the last two centuries , increases in bullet speed have come slowly , but I think we 're going to see that change . Just in the last 10 years , big-game bullets have gone into warp drive . Special-purpose cartridges , such as the 7mm STW and the Lazzeroni 7.21 Firehawk , are pushing 140- to 160-grain bullets at 3600 fps , which was undreamed of only a few years ago . Sooner than anyone thinks , we will see varmint bullets that crack the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THE END OF THE BULLET AS WE KNOW IT ? But the real breakthrough in velocity may come when we discard the rifled barrel in favor of a system that the Army is using in the Abrams M-1 tank . One of the ways to defeat armor ( defeat is the military 's insipid euphemism for " blow a gaping hole through " ) is hypervelocity-speeds far in excess of 6000 fps . But getting this kind of speed with a rifled barrel is almost impossible . The action of the rifling cutting into the projectile and then twisting it raises pressures beyond acceptable limits . For many years ballisticians have known that the way to overcome this problem is to shoot through a smoothbore barrel , but if you do n't rifle the bore , the projectile does n't spin , and you have no way to keep it on course . So the designers of the M-1 tank hit upon the idea of using a small-diameter penetrator rod made of depleted uranium . They encased it in a sabot and equipped it with small fins that pop up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photograph The caseless cartridge is not a new idea , but the Austrian firm of Voere has brought it to its highest state of development ( below ) . Swarovski 's LRS laser rangefinding scope is a commercial success despite its large size and very high price . In the future , such scopes will be smaller lighter and cheaper // Et voila ! They got screaming velocity and accuracy of an astounding order . ( I 'm not allowed to reveal the exact numbers , but you can probably get the specifics on the Discovery Channel . ) The implications for hunting rifles are vast . You 'd see velocities , across the board , that would be twice what we 're now getting . Barrels would no longer have to be rifled , and a wornout barrel would be a quaint problem from the past . Could finned projectiles be made as small as .24 or .22 ? Do n't rule it out . ROCKETS AND CASELESS CARTRIDGES During the 1960s a company called Gyrojet introduced a miniature rocket that was fired from a handgun-shaped launcher . The little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained a tiny propellant charge . When you pulled the trigger , a hammer struck backward , hitting the rocket on its nose , driving it into a stationary firing pin that ignited the charge . The rocket 's exhaust ports were angled so that the projectile spun in flight ( at least in theory ) , and this kept it on a steady course . But there were problems . Accuracy was , to put it mildly , nil . You needed a lot of luck to hit a very large barn at very short range . The " handguns " looked like they cost $12.37 to manufacture but sold for hundreds of dollars . People did n't buy them in droves , and the Gyrojet died after a few years on the market . But the idea is intriguing . With a rocket you get lots of velocity and minimal recoil . If someone came out with an accurate minirocket in a noncheesy-looking launcher and put a reasonable price on it , who knows ? IN 1967 SMITH Wesson revived a concept that was introduced by German armorers during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was fired from a modified S &W; M76 submachine gun . The powder charge was molded around the base of the bullet , and the base of the powder was coated with a priming compound that was ignited by an electric current that passed through the bolt face . Without the brass case , much of the weight and expense of conventional ammo was done away with , and it radically simplified the gun 's design , since there was no extraction or ejection required . Photograph This is the armorpiercing round for the Army 's M- 1 Abrams tank . It employs a sabot , aluminum stabilizing fins , and a smalldiameter penetrator // The M-76 project never went anywhere . However , the idea made eminent sense , and it reappeared in 1969 , when Daisy/Heddon introduced the V-L system , the invention of a Belgian named Jules van Langenhoven . Daisy offered caseless .22 ammo that was ignited not by electricity but by compressed air . The V-L system was perfectly workable but was not a commercial success . And yet the caseless cartridge will not die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of years , offered a series of caseless-cartridge guns in .22 and 6mm . They use electronic ignition ; a pair of batteries housed in the pistol grip provides enough juice for 5,000 shots . Accuracy is , by all accounts , excellent , as it should be , since all the variables of a brass case are eliminated . The Voere guns have not caught on in a big way . One reason their comparatively high price ; and the other is that the idea is probably still too radical . Nonetheless , I suspect the caseless cartridge is lying dormant , ready to someday burst forth and eliminate the brass case forever . THE COMPUTING SCOPE For generations 300 yards has been considered the practical limit at which a good rifleman can shoot at big game . The limitation was placed there by bullet velocity ; projectiles that travel at 3000 fps or less drop like stones past 300 yards , and the problem of allowing for that trajectory is more than most people can handle in the field . But when you push a bullet to 4000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit extended to 500 yards-if you can estimate the range . Very few shooters have the chance to practice at truly long distances , and so we are now figuring out range with laser rangefinders , most of which are bulky and expensive . What we will get , before very long , is standard-size scopes with built-in laser rangefinders that are accurate out to 1,000 yards . And it 's not going to stop there . Someone will stick a microchip into a scope into which you can feed your bullet 's velocity , its ballistic coefficient , and the body depth of the critter you 're shooting at . This same chip will then get the range from a laser , calculate the amount of holdover required , and shift your crosshairs so that you can aim directly at the beast in question . You laugh ? Well , I 'm not laughing , because here I sit , massaging my mouse , working with things called floppies and modems and hard drives , communicating on e-mail and the Net . Compared to that , a computer-driven , range-compensating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's extremely small in diameter the depleted-uranium penetrator rod is very effective due to its great weight and high velocity . // <p>                     on the other side blinked twice as though he did n't know quite what to think . <p> " I 'm Janine Hartman . " She drew in a deep breath . " Gramps said if he was n't back from his appointment , I should introduce myself . " <p> " Yes , " Zachary said after a moment of strained silence . " But he did n't tell me you 'd be wearing  --  " <p> " Oh , the bandanna dress , " Janine said , smoothing one hand over her lap . The dress had been constructed of red and blue bandannas ; it featured a knee-length zigzag hemline and closely hugged her hips . " It was a gift . And since I 'm meeting the girl who made it later , I thought I should wear it . " <p> " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas-tree lights strung between large beads on a bootlace that dangled from her neck . " It 's a bit outrageous , is n't it ? That was a gift , too . I think it 's kind of cute , do n't you ? Pamela is so clever . " <p> " Pamela ? " <p> " A teenager from the Friendship Club . " <p> " Isee , " Zach said . <p> " I do volunteer work there and the two of us hit it off as soon as we met . Pam 's mother does n't live in the area and she 's at that awkward age and needs a friend . For some reason she took a liking to me , which was fine because I think she 's wonderful . " <p> " I see , " he said again . <p> Janine doubted he did . <p> " The necklace is different I 'll grant you , " Zach was saying  --  which was n't admitting to much . His dark eyes narrowed as he studied it . <p> Now that she 'd met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so impressed with him  --  if appearances were anything to judge by . In his well-tailored suit , he was the very picture of a high-powered executive , crisp , formal and in control . He was younger than she 'd assumed , possibly in his early thirties , but it was difficult to tell . His facial features were attractive enough , but he was n't strikingly handsome . Still , she found herself fascinated by the strength of character she saw in the uneven planes of his face . His dark hair was cut military short . His jaw was strong , his cheekbones high and his mouth full . That was the way she 'd describe him physically , but there was apparently much more to this man than met the eye . At least , her grandfather was convinced of it . <p> Several months earlier Anton Hartman had merged his well-established business-supply firm with the fast-expanding company owned by Zachary Thomas . Together the two men had quickly dominated the market . <p> For weeks now , Gramps had wanted Janine to meet Zachary . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they were discussing . To say her grandfather thought highly of his partner was an understatement . <p> " Gramps has spoken well of you , " she said next . <p> A hint of a smile  --  just the merest suggestion  --  touched his mouth , giving her the impression that he did n't smile often . " Your grandfather has one of the keenest business minds in the country . " <p> " He 's incredible , is n't he ? " <p> Zachary 's nod betrayed no hesitation . <p> There was a polite knock on the door and a tall middle-aged woman wearing a navy-blue pin-striped suit stepped into the room . " Mr. Hartman phoned , " she announced primly . " He 's been delayed and asked that you meet him at the restaurant . " <p> Zach 's lean dark face tightened briefly before he cast Janine an uneasy glance . " Did he say when he was going to get there ? " <p> " I 'm sorry , Mr. Thomas , but he did n't . " <p> Janine looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three . If they were delayed much longer , she 'd be late . <p> She scowled at Zach 's apparent reluctance to entertain her in Gramp 's absence . " Maybe it would be best if we rescheduled for another day , " she offered brightly . She was n't any happier about the prospect of waiting in a restaurant , just the two of them , than he was . " Gramps is held up , I 'm meeting Pam , and you 're obviously a busy man . " <p> An uncomfortable silence followed her remark . " Is it your habit not to show up when your grandfather 's expecting you ? " he asked sharply . <p> Janine bristled . " Of course not . " She swallowed the words to defend herself . Her suggestion had n't been unreasonable and he had no right to insinuate that she was inconsiderate and rude . <p> " Then I feel we should meet your grandfather at the restaurant as he requested , " he finished stiffly . <p> " By all means , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat , watching Zach from the corner of her eye . He did n't like her . That realization had a peculiar effect on Janine . She felt disappointed and a little sad . Zach had n't said much , and actually there had n't been time for a real conversation , but she 'd sensed his attitude almost from the first . He thought of her as spoiled and frivolous , probably because he knew she did n't hold a responsible job and loved to travel . Part of her longed to explain that there were good reasons she 'd chosen the lifestyle she had . But from the looks he was sending her , it would be a waste of breath . <p> Besides , it was more important to maintain the peace , however strained , for Gramps 's sake . She 'd have enjoyed getting to know Zach , perhaps even becoming friends , but that did n't seem likely . <p> That morning , before Gramps had left the house , he 'd been as excited as a little boy about their luncheon date . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for breakfast , his blue eyes sparkling . When she 'd refused the use of the limousine , he 'd spent the next fifteen minutes giving her detailed directions , as though she 'd never driven in downtown Seattle . <p> Almost as an afterthought , he 'd mentioned that he had a morning meeting with an important client . If he had n't returned by the time she arrived , she was to go directly to Zach 's office , introduce herself and wait for him there . <p> Shrugging into a raincoat , Zachary moved toward the door . " Are you ready ? " <p> She nodded , burying her hands in her pockets . <p> Thankfully the restaurant her grandfather had chosen was close by . Without further discussion , they began to walk the few short blocks , although Janine had trouble matching her stride with Zach 's much longer one . <p> Struggling to keep up with him , Janine studied Zachary Thomas , trying to determine exactly what disturbed her about the man . His height was a good example . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and since she was almost five-eight there was n't more than a few inches ' difference between them . Why , then , did he make her feel much shorter ? <p> He must have sensed her scrutiny because he turned and glared at her . Janine gave him a feeble smile , and felt the color rise in her cheeks . Zach 's dismissive glance did nothing to boost her ego . She was n't vain , but Janine knew she was attractive . Over the years , plenty of men had told her so , including Brian , the man who 'd broken her heart . But she could have warts on her nose for all the notice Zachary Thomas gave her . <p> If he found the bandanna dress disconcerting , he was probably put off by her hairstyle as well . She wore it short , neatly trimmed in the back with extra-long bangs slanted across her forehead . For years Janine had kept her hair shoulder-length , parted in the middle . One afternoon a few weeks earlier , for no particular reason , she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood for something radical and the style she now sported seemed more appropriate to the pages of a fashion magazine . Pam had been crazy about the change , insisting she looked " phenomenal . " Janine was n't convinced . Her one comfort was that , given time , her hair would grow back . <p> Janine suspected Zach had characterized her as flamboyant , if not downright flashy . She , in turn , would describe him as austere and disciplined , perhaps solitary . Her grandfather saw all that , she knew , and a good deal more . <p> " Mr. Hartman is waiting for you , " the maetre d ' informed them when they entered the plush waterfront restaurant . He led them across the thick carpet to a high semicircular booth upholstered in blue velvet . <p> " Janine , Zach . " Anton Hartman smiled broadly as they approached . The years had been kind to her grandfather . His bearing was still straight and confident , although his hair had grown completely white . His deep blue eyes , only a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I apologize for the inconvenience . " <p> " It was n't any problem , " Zach answered for both of them before Janine could respond  --  as if he 'd expected her to complain ! <p> Ignoring him , Janine removed her coat and kissed her grandfather 's leathery cheek . <p> " Janine , " he began , then gasped . " Where did you get that dress ? " <p> " Do you like it ? " She threw out her arms and whirled around once to give him the full effect . " I know it 's a bit unconventional , but I did n't think you 'd mind . " <p> Gramps 's gaze flickered to Zach , then back to her . " On anyone else it would be scandalous , but on you , my dear , it 's a work of art . " <p> " Honestly , Gramps , " she said , laughing softly . " You never could lie very well . " She slid into the booth next to her grandfather , forcing him into the center , between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but after her turbulent first encounter with Zach , she preferred to keep her distance . For that matter , he did n't seem all that eager to be close to her , either . <p> She glanced at him and noted , almost smugly , that he was already studying the menu . No doubt he found ordinary conversation a waste of time . Janine picked up her own menu . She was famished . At breakfast she 'd only had time for coffee and a single piece of toast , and she had every intention of making up for it now . <p> When the waiter came to take their order , Janine asked for the seafood entrTe and soup and salad . She 'd decide about dessert later , she said . Once he 'd left , Gramps leaned toward Zach . " Janine never has to worry about her weight . " He made this sound as if it was a subject of profound and personal interest to them both . " Her grandmother was the same way . How my Anna could eat , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Gramps , " Janine whispered under her breath . " I 'm sure Zach could n't care less how much I weigh . " <p> " Nonsense , " Gramps said , gently patting her hand . " I hope you two had the chance to introduce yourselves . " <p> " Oh , yes , " Janine returned automatically . <p> " Your granddaughter is everything you claimed , " Zachary said , but the inflection in his voice implied something completely different to Janine than it did to her grandfather . She guessed that to Anton , he seemed courteous and complimentary . But he was telling Janine he 'd found her to be the spoiled darling he 'd long suspected . He did n't openly dislike her , but he was n't too impressed with her , either . <p> Unfortunately , that was probably due to more than just the dress and the lightbulb necklace . <p> Janine watched for her grandfather 's reaction to Zach 's words and she knew she was right when his gaze warmed and he nodded , obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever , Janine had to grant him that much . <p> " How did the meeting with Anderson go ? " Zach asked . <p> For a moment her grandfather stared at him blankly . <p> " Oh , Anderson Fine , fine . Everything went just as I 'd hoped . " Then he cleared his throat and carefully spread the linen napkin across his lap . " As you both know , " he said , " I 've been wanting the two of you to meet for some time now . Janine is the joy of my life . She 's kept me young and brought me much happiness over the years . I fear that , without her , I would have turned into a bitter old man . " <p> His look was so full of tenderness that Janine had to lower her eyes and swallow back a rush of tears . Gramps had been her salvation , too . He 'd taken her in after the sudden deaths of her parents , raised her with a gentle hand and loved her enough to allow her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to have a six-year-old girl unexpectedly thrust into his life , but he 'd never complained . <p> " My only son died far too young , " Anton said slowly , painfully . <p> " I 'm sorry , " Zachary murmured . <p> The genuine compassion Janine heard in his voice surprised her . And it definitely pleased her . Zach 's respect and affection for her grandfather won her immediate approval  --  even if the man did n't seem likely to ever feel anything so positive toward her . <p> " For many years I mourned the loss of my son and his wife , " Anton continued , his voice gaining strength . " I 've worked all my life , built an empire that stretches across these fifty states , and in the process have become a wealthy man . " <p> Janine studied her grandfather closely . He was rarely this serious . He was n't one to list his accomplishments , and she wondered at his strange mood . <p> " When Zach brought his business into the area , I saw in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this life . It 's said that there are men who make things happen , those who watch things happen and those who wonder what happened . Zachary is a man who makes things happen . In many ways , the two of us are alike . That 's one of the primary reasons I decided to approach him with a proposal to merge our companies . " <p> " I 'm honored that you should think so , sir . " <p> " Sir , " Anton repeated softly and chuckled . He raised his hand , motioning for the waiter . " You have n't called me that in six months , and there 's no reason to start again now . " <p> The waiter returned with a bottle of expensive champagne . Soon glasses were poured and set before them . <p> " Now , " Anton continued , " as I said earlier , I have the two people I love most in this world together with me for the first time , and I do n't mind telling you , it feels good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Happiness , " Janine echoed , sipping her champagne . <p> Her eyes met Zach 's above the crystal flute and she saw a glint of admiration . If she were dining on it , @x " You must be Zachary Thomas , " Janine said breathlessly as she whirled into the office . " Sorry I 'm late , but I got hung up in traffic on Fourth Avenue . I did n't realize they 'd torn up the whole street . " Still a little winded , she unfastened her coat , tossed it over the back of the visitor 's chair and threw herself down , facing the large executive desk . <p> The man she 'd starve  --  to quote a favorite expression of her grandfather 's  --  but it was just enough for her to know that he 'd think more kindly of her because of her love for Anton . <p> Her grandfather chuckled and whispered something in his native tongue , a German dialect from the old country . Over the years she 'd picked up a smattering of the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a college German professor , he 'd barely recognized the words . <br> Continues ...
