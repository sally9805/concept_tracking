MARRY ME ! " JUMBER SHOUTED as soon as his boat was in earshot . <p> Larkin shook her head and turned to pound more caulking into a crevice in Kittiwake 's deck . She had come out to work on her boat when the uncles had spotted a sail on the horizon . She had known it would have to be Jumber . No one else would come to Fairny this early in the year , when the sea had n't yet thrown off its winter melancholy . <p> " Marry me ! " he yelled again , apparently thinking she had n't heard . He was practically standing on the bowsprit , clutching a forestay . A pink knit sweater stretched across his rotund torso , and a visored cap hid the thinning patch in his black hair . He had a bushy mustache and eyes crinkled from squinting into the sun . Larkin noted enviously that his boat was in even better repair than last year ; painted green and red with shiny brass fittings , she was the brightest thing Fairny Bay had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some paint for Kittiwake next time he came , even if it meant doing without new boots . <p> " You boat abuser ! " she yelled back . " You 're risking Bobber 's life , taking her out this early . " <p> " It was love . So shoot me , " he said . Then , to his crew , " Come about , you rotting turds ! Where 's the hawser ? Do I have to do the whole blistering thing myself ? " <p> Bobber nosed neatly in to the tumbledown dock where the great Fairny fleet had once moored . Jumber had two crewmen this year , Larkin saw . He had prospered . Back in Soris , the women were probably lined up to catch his eye . Inland women were like that . <p> The trader would have jumped onto the sagging gray dock , but stopped when another person emerged from Bobber 's hatch . He was a strange sight , swathed in a furry greatcoat . His long black hair fell about his shoulders ; his close-cropped black beard was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked around at the empty bay , the bare hills , then the line of gray , leaning shacks that was the village . His brows contracted . " You have cheat me ! " he cried shrilly . <p> " No , your honor , this is Fairny , " Jumber said . <p> " You gregious Torna , this is lie ! " the man insisted . " Where are sheeps ? " <p> " Oh , not again , " Jumber said with overtaxed patience . " Listen , I told you there was n't much here . You could have gotten your sheep much closer to Softs  --  did n't I say that ? " <p> The foreigner looked around . " There are no sheep ! " <p> " They 're out in the hills , " Jumber said . <p> " What ? " the foreigner said , looking startled . <p> Jumber gestured toward the windy grassland behind the village . " Out grazing . In the pastures . That 's where the sheep are . " <p> " You think I am numbskull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he want sheep ? Larkin asked , resting her arms on Kittiwake 's gunwale rail . <p> The foreigner 's attention was diverted . He gave her a deep bow . " Pardons , precious lady . I am distract . I am dupe of salty schemer . I came on search for Fairny , where great sheep are build . " <p> Larkin saw the problem . " Oh , you mean sheeps ! " she said . <p> " Yes , yes , " the foreigner said excitedly . " Big ones , that walk on water . Boom-boom . " <p> " What ? " Jumber said . <p> " Kind lady , can you tell where is Fairny of the sheep ? " <p> " This is it , " Larkin said . <p> The man looked incredulous . " Am I dream ? There are no tree , no boatyard . " <p> " You 're fifty years too late , " Larkin said , hearing in her own voice the trace of leaden bitterness that infected everyone in Fairny when they spoke of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not to sell , not to sail . They 're gone . " <p> The man first looked puzzled , then crafty . " I think you pull my foot , " he said . " You think I have not riches enough . " <p> " No , there just are n't any ships . No more . " <p> She turned back to her work , not wanting to face more questions . She ran her fingers down the smooth wood of Kittiwake 's deck , weathered to the silver of a dragonfly 's wing . Kittiwake was a handy little craft , agile on a close reach , well suited to shellfishing ; but she was a far cry from the legendary vessels that had once made Fairny famous . <p> They had been ships that no one who saw could forget . Mist , in which Gennaday of Rusk had sailed into the other circles ; great Havenmaker , which Ison Gavro himself had led against the Torna usurpers . Their names were thick in the winter tales the uncles told at fireside . All through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In those days mankind had ruled the land , but Fairny 's ships had ruled the Widewater . <p> Larkin had been born in Fairny , but she had never seen one of the great ships  --  not by daylight , at least . They had come to her in dreams , so beautiful she would wake with her throat aching . Tall and slim , white canvas-winged , rigging singing like harp strings in the wind , they always passed a little beyond reach in her dreams  --  just as they had passed across Fairny 's horizon . Now all that was left of them was a slow wake of memories . <p> Over the banging of her mallet she could hear a loud argument going on in Bobber  --  the stranger 's voice shrill with indignation over something ; Jumber shouting back in his demonstrative Toms way . Larkin wondered as she worked if she could ever marry a man who loved an argument so . <p> Presently the shouting ceased and footsteps approached across the dock . " Permission to board ? " Jumber 's voice said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curl of dark hair out of her eyes . Jumber was grinning at his double entendre . His laughter was part of the spring to Larkin , like the meadow flowers and the nesting guillemots . It was always jarring at first , for each fall when the traders left , the village lapsed into a long silence ; as the days dwindled Larkin grew accustomed to communicating in monosyllables with people who no longer had anything to say to each other . And then Jumber 's laughter would come again , brassily shattering the comfortable monotony of grayness and decay . <p> " I thought one of those inland women would have gotten you by now , " Larkin said . <p> " Worried ? " he asked . She snorted in answer , but realized that she had been a little worried : that Jumber 's boat would n't come again , that springtime would never return . <p> " It was a long winter , " she said . " Old Father Gort died just before solstice , Mother Bira just after . " <p> " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Who died . " <p> " It 's all that happens here . " <p> " You do n't belong here , " lumber said . <p> Larkin shrugged , still unused to navigating by word . She would never be as good a talker as lumber . He was Torna ; they were all born talking . <p> " The aunties say I 'm turning into a seawife , " she said . <p> " A what ? " <p> " You know , a woman married to her boat . Maybe they do n't have them where you come from ; " <p> " No . " He held out a hand . " Come on over to Bobber . I brought something for you . " <p> Larkin looked at him hopefully . " Paint ? " <p> " What do you mean , paint ? " lumber protested . " What kind of suitor do you think I am ? " <p> " Kittiwake needs it , " Larkin said . " Just look at her . Gray as driftwood . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritation ; then , seeing how Larkin frowned , he held up his hands and said , " All right , I 'll bring paint next time . lust let me give you something first . After all , I do n't want to marry the boat . " <p> Larkin was about to step onto the dock when Jumber 's crewmen emerged from Bobber 's hold hefting a huge , brass-bound trunk between them . The black-haired stranger followed , berating them incoherently and waving his hands . <p> " Who is that ? " Larkin whispered . <p> " Some crazy mainlander , " ; umber answered , then laughed . " Would you believe all this time I thought he was talking about sheep ? " <p> Stranger , crewmen , and trunk set off in a wobbling procession down the dock . Already half the village was standing at their doors or peering from windows at the sight . <p> " Come on , " Jumber said . <p> Bobber 's hold was crammed full of casks , bales , and crates that smelled of sawdust packing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage , ducking where the beams swooped low , into a little cabin they all had shared on the trip out . He pulled a black sea-chest from under his berth . <p> " Ready ? " he said . Then , with a flourish , he brought them out : a pair of tall leather boots , intricately tooled . Larkin took them to the porthole to examine . They were polished on the outside to a rich cherry-wood color , and lined on the inside with chamois soft as felt . She ran a finger over them in awe . She had never owned anything so lovely ; for a moment she hated her poverty . <p> " They 're beautiful , " she said . " Too beautiful to wear on the boat . I 'd rain them . " <p> " You could wear them in Soris , " Jumber said . " You could wear anything you wanted there . " <p> Larkin wanted to believe it , but could n't . In Soris , she would have appearances to keep up . Everyone would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She put one arm around Jumber 's bulk and kissed him on the cheek , clutching the boots in the other arm . He was watching her expectantly ; he hoped for something in return . Not sex ; he knew he 'd have that anyway . He wanted a commitment . And that was just the thing Larkin could n't bear to give . <p> She made a dash for the door then , hugging the boots tight . Through the tunnel of cargo she ran , up the companion ladder into the sunlight , and across the dock to Kittiwake . With a single movement she tossed the boots on deck and unlooped the mooring lines . Jumping aboard , she seized the boathook and pushed off , then scrambled to the mainmast and yanked at the halyard . The sheave at the mast top screeched unwillingly , but the sail climbed and caught the wind . Larkin hurried aft , catching up the sheet and tiller . Then , like a musician teasing the perfect note out of the tension of opposing forces , she made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bay . <p> She stood there as the boat bucked across the choppy waves , trying to think only of the strain of the line in one hand and the balancing tug of the tiller in the other . For a while she played on them , feeling Kittiwake respond to each little adjustment . She could almost imagine the boat was waking under her hands , freed after the long winter ashore . If only it were true . <p> At the mouth of the bay the sharp cool of the ocean wind hit them ; Kittiwake heeled over , water bubbling past her hull . The lines creaked , stretching taut . As a sheet of cold spray leaped skyward from the bow , Larkin laughed aloud , feeling the wind in her teeth . She braced her feet apart and rode the tossing deck . <p> This is where I belong , she thought . Not in Soris , among all those people with their landlocked minds . And not in Fairny either , where everyone lost their will to live when the ships left . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just flopping around ; but out here they were hurrying west as if they knew something . Larkin sniffed the wind and squinted across the gray landscape , trying to gauge the sea 's mood . It was a fretful time of year . The sea had a preoccupied look , as if something were afoot . <p> She cleated the sheet loosely and secured the tiller in its collar , then went below to fetch the carved wooden box that held her dreamweed . She stood on the foredeck to toss a spring gift to the horned panther whose realm lay below the sea . A wave bared foamy teeth and swallowed the offering whole . <p> She stooped and picked up the boots she had tossed on deck . They were already spotted with salt water ; she spit on them and tried to rub it off . Then she carried them hack and stood with the tiller under one arm , the boots under the other . <p> Jumber 's offer was the best chance she would ever have to escape this desolate island and the village that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over the winter she had constructed a mental image of what her life would be like . lumber would prosper  --  there was little doubt of that . He would soon buy a bigger boat , and then a few more , and at last he would become a merchant with a fleet , like the ones in Tornabay . He would grow stout and solid , and probably she would too  --  for there would be children , enough to fill a bright , noisy houseful . It would be a good life , secure and happy . They would be leading citizens of Soris someday . She would gradually forget what it was like to live on haunted ground , always in the shadow of a lost past . <p> And she would never go to sea again . <p> She steered Kittiwake into the wind and went forward to raise the jib . When the big sail billowed out the little boat heeled till the lee rail was scraping the waves . Larkin leaned on the tiller with a whoop of exhilaration . As if sharing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into air , then crashing down again in spray . <p> It was getting on toward evening when Larkin came back into Fairny Bay . She was in a quieter mood , but no more decided than when she had set out . Whatever course she took , change was ahead . <p> " Where have you been ? " Auntie Broil said when Larkin came into the small cottage , boots and tackle slung over her shoulder . <p> " Out , " Larkin said . <p> " In that boat of yours ? " <p> " Mmm . " Larkin went to the stove to see what was cooking , she was ravenously hungry . <p> " Do n't you touch anything you did n't fix , " Auntie said . She was cooking sweet roots , hoarded like jewels over the winter . <p> " Is Jumber coming ? " Larkin asked . Auntie doted on Jumber ; he always brought out her rare moods of extravagance . <p> " Yes , if we can set a table that wo n't shame us . " <p> " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larkin said . <p> In the warm comer behind the stove sat Mother Keer , hunched and frail , in her wide-armed chair . When Larkin came over a radiant smile lit her face and she held out a bony , age-spotted hand . <p> " How are you today , Mother ? " Larkin asked . <p> " She 's had the trots all day long , " Auntie Broil said : Mother pursed her lips and shook her head at the way Auntie talked . <p> " Are you better now , Mother ? " <p> " She 's just going to have some broth for supper , is n't that right ? " Auntie said . <p> Mother Keer gripped Larkin 's hand and said readily , " Jumber 's coming . " <p> " Yes , I know . " <p> " Have you married him yet ? " Mother Keer asked , as if it were something she might have missed . <p> " No . You 'll know if I do . " <p> Auntie Broil was rearranging the furniture with loud , purposeful thumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . You would n't need to be eating mutton and oatmeal all winter long . " Larkin heard the unsaid words : my mutton , my oatmeal . <p> " Your mother could have had an inland man , " Mother Keer said . <p> " Yes , I know , " Larkin said . She had heard the story at least four thousand times . <p> " She turned him down , " Mother Keer said , then added  --  as Larkin recited the often-heard words under her breath  --  " and regretted it the rest of her life . " <p> " I 'm going to wash up , " Larkin said . " I 'll be back to help . " <p> When Jumber arrived , he brought his foreign passenger with him . Auntie Broll pretended to be honored at hosting someone who had come all the way from the mainland , but was privately frantic at the impression her simple fare would make . She kept whispering to Larkin , " I do n't care what he thinks . This is how we live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for guests . " <p> Fortunately , the stranger flirted and flattered her in outrageously broken language , and she gradually relaxed . After dinner , Larkin stoked up the cast-iron stove with peat and lit the oil lamps so that the tiny cottage seemed cozy and companionable . In the lulls of conversation they could hear the crash of waves against the shore and the wind tugging and prying at the shutters . " The Ashwin are in the air tonight , " Mother Keer said . <p> Soon the uncles started to arrive , curious to have a look at the foreigner . They took up seats on every chest , stool , and window sill , but left the chairs on either side of the stranger vacant . <p> The room was already full when Larkin looked up to see her brother Runar at the door . She nearly called out ; she had scarcely seen him in a month . But the greeting fled her mind as she saw the unkempt mats in his black hair , the clothes that looked like they had been his bedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow under his prominent brows ; he glanced around as if he were a trespasser . <p> The stranger was talking again on his old subject of " sheeps . " It was clear he suspected some conspiratorial rose at work around him , for he wheedled them to reveal all they would . And in a way he was right : for though the uncles would talk and talk again about the ships of their childhood , they were strangely reticent about crucial threads of information . There were just some things too close to the heart for words . <p> " Havenmaker came from Fairny , you know , " Uncle Bosk said . " She was a grand ship , like a floating fort . She had tall fore- and after castles , all carved with gilded seadogs . Havenmaker never lost an engagement when she could come alongside the enemy . The only reason she lost was that the Toms had cannons . " <p> Jumber said good-naturedly to the stranger , " They still think that was cheating . " <p> " She had eighteen sails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seventeen , " Bosk said . " I ought to know , it was my great-granduncle who brought her in . " <p> " Well , my cousin 's grandfather sailed in her , " Stole maintained , " and she had nine square sails , seven stay sails , a jib  --  " <p> " Right , " Bosk said , keeping track on his fingers . " That 's seventeen . " "  --  and a spritsail . " <p> " Oh yes . I forgot the spritsail . " <p> They could go on all night , debating the details of a hundred bygone ships , and whose family had delivered each one . But no one in the room seemed bored ; even the stranger was listening attentively . As Larkin scanned their faces , her eyes kept returning to Runar , standing near the door where the light from one of the lamps carved sharp lines across his cheekbones and jaw . He did n't see her ; he was too absorbed in what the old men were saying . His weather-browned face was intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered what Auntie Broll 's dead husband used to say : " That boy was meant to be a shiphunter . " <p> He had been born on the Night of the Naked Bear , and the shadow of it had always followed him . As a child he had been a dreamer and a loner , Larkin his only real friend . Even then he had felt the world 's injustice more keenly than most . But lately , moods of black depression had been growing on him . He would leave the village for weeks on end , tramping out on the hills , living like a bear in the wind and rain . It had been hard for Larkin to accept that there was nothing she could do about it . Now , as she watched him listen to the ship-talk , it struck her that he looked happier than she had seen him in months . <p> " I helped my brother deliver a ship all the way to Tornabay once , when I was nineteen , " Father Orch was saying . " Her hull was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly scraped the clouds . She had as many acres of sail as most farmers have of crops . Under all plain sail , she nearly flew : we hit twenty knots on the Windward Passage . We called her Rosalbin . When we cast anchor at Tornabay the harbormaster said we 'd have to move her or no business would get done on the waterfront . Everyone was just standing on the docks , watching her . They 'd never seen a ship so beautiful . " <p> From his eyes , they could all see how beautiful she had been ; she had left a scar of loss in him , still visible after all these years . <p> " And what did you get for her ? the stranger asked . <p> Father Orch looked down , and everyone was silent , for the ships had been like Fairny 's soul . <p> " Yes , we sold her , " Orch said . He looked up . " Fairny was a prosperous place then , not like you see today . Hundreds lived here , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes had carpets and mirrors , and we ate beef all winter long . " <p> " You could again , " the stranger said . " I give as much as you get then . More . You give ten sheep , I still pay same . " <p> The uncles shook their heads silently . <p> " You think you can not make sheep now , " the stranger said slyly . " You think , ' Silly stranger , can he not see sheep impossible ? We have cut down trees . ' " <p> Everyone stared at him uncomprehending . He laughed . " You see , I am not numbskull . I know you must have wood for mast and hull , and pitch for seal the joint-holes . You think all such is gone . But tree is many other place . I take you there . Or if not , I bring forest here . Then you have sheep again . " <p> If only it were that easy . The uncles sat silent . How could they explain to a mainlander ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just tell him . " <p> It was Runar . He was standing , arms crossed , surveying the uncles with a judgmental frown . Larkin gave him a signal of caution , but he barged on : " Go on , say it . You never built a ship in your lives . " <p> " That brother of yours ! " Auntie Broll hissed in Larkin 's ear . <p> His voice rose . " The ships of the olden days were n't dead and manmade things , like the boats we have today . They were the real thing . They used to come past in great herds , migrating north for the summer . Each spring you would go out to catch them . You would tame them , and tether them , and bring them back to live out lives of servitude to humans . Their spirits died when you brought them back , but that did n't stop you . You sailed their empty shells : " His scowl darkened as he scanned the uncles ' faces turned to him , speechless . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many you took . And every year your greed grew , and you caught more , and finally the herd dwindled away . So that you could have carpets and beef you took everything and left your children nothing . Now your grandchildren have never even seen a ship alive , except in your stories . " <p> For a moment the room was utterly silent . Then everyone began speaking at once . Uncle Bosk stood , red-faced , to shout at Runar through the sudden pandemonium . " Get out of here , you mother 's blunder , and stop talking of things you know nothing about ! " <p> Runar had begun to shout back when Larkin grasped his arm . " Come here , " she said firmly . <p> He let her drag him out the door . When she had closed it behind them and they stood in the cold , biting wind , they could still hear the unsettled voices inside . <p> " What do you want ? " he said angrily at her . <p> Her mind was racing . " Runar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Those old fools , " he said , making a combative movement as if to go back in . She blocked his way . <p> " Runar , how do we know the ships are all gone ? " <p> He stared at her with madly gleaming eyes . " They all say  --  " <p> " That 's just it . All we have is their word on it . Fifty years old . " <p> " You 're crazy , " he said . <p> " I do n't want to take their word for it . I want to see for myself . It 's the right time of year , Runar : just when the hunters would have gone out in the old days . What do you say ? " <p> " There are n't any ships there . " <p> " Then we 'll come back . " <p> " And everyone will laugh at us . " <p> " So what ? " <p> " No ! " Runar said . " I do n't have a boat . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your boat . I would n't go unless I was captain of my own . " <p> She knew that expression : it was his irrational stubborn streak . It stood in between him and all the things he really wanted , all the things that were good for him . There would be no budging him . " I 'll find a boat for you , then , " she said . <p> " Who would lend me a boat ? " His voice was mocking . <p> " I 'll find someone . " She would have to . When she had started talking it had just been something to distract him , to keep him from going back inside . Now the idea was flaming in her . She wanted to go , and wanted him to go with her , before they grew so far apart they could not touch anymore . They had played at hunting ships when they were children . Now she wanted to do the real thing , to prove they were still the same people , to make continuity amid all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . <p> " I can think of half a dozen who would come . " <p> " No old ones , " he warned . <p> " No. lust people our age . " <p> The idea had finally caught him , as it had caught her . He began to talk about supplies , and timing . Then he suddenly-looked at her , with the wind blowing his hair back , and said , " What would we do if there were ships out there ? " <p> " Are you crazy ? " Larkin said . " Did n't you hear what that mainlander is offering ? You could buy a dozen boats . You could buy the whole village . " <p> He slowly smiled . " What would those old gull-baits think of that ? " <p> " This whole place would come to life again , " Larkin said . " We 'd have a town here , not a cemetery . " Inside her , a voice added , And I would n't have to leave . <p> That last thought was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snuggled together under a mound of woolen blankets in Auntie Broll 's loft . In fact , she was very careful what she told him ; but he still sat bolt upright and said , " Do I look like a lunatic ? " <p> She pulled him back down , for the air was cold and he was letting it all in . " It would only be for a day or two , " she said . " Runar would take good care of her . " <p> " Bobber 's my living , " he said . " I do n't lend her to anyone . No one . Not my own brother . " <p> " Runar would be your brother , you know , if ... " She let that hang . " He needs it , Jumber . He 's had a bad time . This will be a healing thing for him . I just know it . " <p> " I ca n't do it , " Jumber said . " She 's all laden , for one thing . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just enough to make her faster ; leave the rest for ballast . " <p> Jumber sat up again . " You 've got it all thought out , have n't you ? You do think I 'm a lunatic . " <p> When Larkin pulled him back this time she crawled on top of him to pin him down . " I just thought you 'd want to help us out , " she said . " Like family . " <p> " No , " he said . <p> She bent down to kiss him . <p> " Never , " he said . <p> WHEN HER crew came aboard , shouldering their duffel bags , Larkin watched with a frown to make sure no one was smuggling aboard any forbidden things . No compass or chronometer , no sextant or chart could be taken shiphunting . The uncles all agreed : there was no way to find the ships but by setting a course on trust . " If you know where you are , you wo n't be in the right place , " they said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sail . He looked like a wild man with his shaggy black hair all windblown ; but there was a quiet concentration in the way he checked every detail of the rigging , like a craftsman at work . Watching him , Larkin could n't help but feel a deep glow of satisfaction at what she had done . <p> " Ready ? " she called . <p> " I have one more person coming , " Runar said . <p> They had found nine crew members . Five would go on Kittiwake ; for though she was smaller , she was also faster and more likely to make a catch , if any were there to be made . <p> Larkin scanned the shore for the missing crew member and saw there only a stocky figure staring glumly at them , mustache a droop . Jumber . She waved gaily . He put his hands in his pockets . With a glance to make sure everything was ready , she leaped onto the dock and ran shoreward . <p> " I 'm out of my mind , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to Bobber . We 'll be back in two days , I promise . Three at the most . Runar 's a good sailor ; he 'll take care of her . " <p> Jumber looked at his feet . " I wish it was only Bobber that I was worried about . " <p> So he understood more than she had told him . He 'd seen that she was smelling the fresh air of freedom . She had wheedled him into becoming her accomplice in a mad bid to escape all he offered . With a rush of warmth , she kissed his rough cheek . " I love you for this , " she said . <p> " Will I ever know where I stand with you ? " he asked . <p> She would gladly have told him , if she had known . <p> Runar 's last crew member came rushing toward the dock . " I 've got to go , " she said . " Maybe I 'll bring you back a ship . " She turned and fled then , back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she called out to her crew . " Stand by the halyard ! " It seemed a little absurd to give orders on such a small boat , but the make-believe was irresistible . Her crew grinned good-naturedly at her and she could tell their hearts were as high as hers . <p> They had to tack out of the bay , for the wind was south and west . Once clear of Croggan Head , the full brunt of it met them , fresh enough to make the sinuses ache . They came about in a flurry of spray and set course westward toward the Faraway Islands . Kittiwake went first , prancing over the waves ; Bobber followed , rolling and portly ; her broad cargo hull made her look a little pregnant . She towed the small dinghy they would use for bait . <p> It was the females they were after , for those were the ships that had once migrated in herds that covered the sea . The males roamed solitary out on the untracked ocean , joining the females only for a mating season each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch a male ship during mating but no one in Fairny had ever tried ; they were combative vessels unfit for taming . The females were easier to catch and train , especially this time of year when they were raising their dinghies and gigs . It was why all true ships were called " she . " <p> They sighted the Faraways on the northern horizon late in the afternoon . No one wanted to stop there ; they were just barren rocks where the seals and birds mated , inhabited by strange , savage folk who lived in round stone houses sunk in the earth . They believed their hearthfires were the direct descendants of a flame that had been carried in a gem from sunken Alta six centuries ago . News from Fairny would mean nothing to them . <p> It was unnerving to set the tiller in its notch and watch the night fall with sails still pulling hard . But there was no risk in it ; beyond the Faraways the islands ended . Only open sea lay ahead . <p> Cory , one of Larkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all sat below in the warm lamplight , singing and stomping to the old reels and hornpipes , as Kittiwake 's motion rolled them rhythmically side to side . Content , Larkin looked from face to face . Cory gave her a freckled , large-toothed grin over the bow of the fiddle . Brill was stretching out his long legs with an air of coot sarcasm it was easy to see through ; Gimble , the youngest of them , was foot-wrestling with her brother Gorran , a genial giant of a man with a mop of brown hair . <p> It was late when Larkin went out on deck to relieve quiet Bedwa , the woman she had left on watch . The world was pitchy black  --  no horizon , no sky , only the occasional polished black gleam of a wave lit by the lanterns at Kittiwake 's mast and bowsprit . Far aft , Bobber 's lanterns gleamed yellow , points suspended in the dark . Larkin sat listening to the muffled fiddle music from below , and the enormous breathing of the sea . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west when they gathered on the frosty deck in mittens and knit caps , their breath steaming in the air . The eastern sky changed slowly from mauve to azure to a clear , waterwashed blue . When the light reached the west they stared  --  for a solid bank of fog lay ahead , hugging the sea . Its low , rolling contours , touched pink by the rising sun , looked for all the world like the hills and valleys of a mystic coastline . <p> Larkin felt very far away from home . She gazed at the gray ghost-land ahead , and felt instinctively that what she saw was a boundary . Once she passed it , there would be no retracing her steps , for in such places lay transformation . She shivered , for the risk was like the cold : chilling and exhilarating at once . Only for a moment did she feel a twinge of sorrow for Jumber . <p> They took in the jib to slow the boat down , and signaled Bobber to come alongside . When they were yards apart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close . Hang out some lanterns . " <p> Runar gave a nod and turned to look ahead at the fog . There was something incandescent in his face . <p> As they drew closer , the gray coastline came sharper into view . It almost looked as if they might land to walk over one of those billowy hillsides into the sky . <p> But there was no edge to it , no shore . Larkin stood on the foredeck as Kittiwake merged with the mist , and a shadow fell across the deck . A clammy wisp of fog brushed her face . For a while , looking astern , she could see the glow of daylight where they had entered . But as they continued on , ever deeper , the light grew dim and soon all was uniform gray , no feature anywhere to distinguish forward from behind . <p> Larkin joined the others sitting in the cockpit . They were silent , for the close air made words sound odd and flat . At first it was easy to see the worry on their faces ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gray flannel muffled them , damply stifling , as if Kittiwake were a trinket being wrapped in batting to be stored away . <p> All they could see of Bobber was the dim glow of her stern lamps on their starboard bow . Larkin sent Gimble forward to conn , worried that they might either lose their companion or ram into her . She had expected the wind to die once they were inside the fog , but Kittiwake moved steadily forward  --  or so it seemed from the vibration of the hull and the feel of the tiller when she took it . For all her eyes told her , they could have been standing stock still . <p> " How long do you suppose this goes on ? " Gorran muttered . <p> " We could be going in circles , " Brill answered . " If we 'd brought a compass , we might know . " <p> Larkin ignored them . It did feel like a long time had passed , but it was impossible to gauge in that world without sun or sky . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they seemed to be growing abnormally slow . She had been following the dim dot of Bobber 's light so long that her strained eyes began to play tricks . The light would fade , then appear again a little to starboard ; then phantom lights began to dot the fog . She blinked and robbed her eyes . <p> " Run forward and hail them , will you ? " she said to Cory . " We 're going to lose them unless we do something . " <p> Soon she heard Cory 's voice calling , " Ahoy , Bobber ! " The heavy silence recoiled , disturbed . <p> The answer that came was unaccountably far away and off to port . Larkin hesitated , then altered course ; the light she had been following faded from view . " Call again , " she said . <p> Again the answer had drifted portward . Frowning , Larkin pushed the tiller even farther from their old course . Off somewhere in the fog , there was a muffled series of shouts , then silence . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mist ahead they glimpsed the curve of a gray sail , and a trellised mast . The next moment it was gone . " Mirage , " Larkin said . " Not really there . " But she wondered . Was it only her own desire forming images on the mist ? She could swear it had been a square rigger . <p> On their port beam a spot of light was swinging to and fro in an arc . Larkin was about to change course to chase it when the black shape of Bobber 's hull suddenly loomed out of the mist , too near . She slammed the tiller over to avoid colliding . <p> " Ahoy , Kittiwake ! " It was Runar swinging the lamp . He now held it up high . " Where did you get to ? We thought we saw you behind us . " <p> " We 've got a tricky mist here , " Larkin called . " It 's been leading us on a chase . " <p> " We 'd better stretch a towline , " Runar said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tossed the line over to Cory , who walked the little boat like a dog to the stem and made the leash fast . Meanwhile , Runar heaved a heavy coil of line across for Larkin to fasten at the bow . Then , with Kittiwake 's sails struck , Bobber pulled forward . The line stretched taut . <p> When Larkin wet her finger and held it up , the wind was too light to detect . And yet , when she tossed a wad of dreamweed over the rail , it floated off astern . Somehow , Bobber was catching enough wind to drag two other boats behind her . <p> Again they settled into silence . The damp had penetrated everywhere by now ; Kittiwake 's bare rigging was dripping . The air seemed almost too thick to breathe . <p> After a while , Bobber started veering off to starboard . Larkin followed suit . Yet Bobber kept slewing ever farther right , till Larkin had the tiller pushed over as far as it could go : " They 're steering in circles ; " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hail them , and break the silence . <p> The quiet had settled deeply around them when a low moan insinuated into the air . It seemed to come from below their feet , from Kittiwake 's hull . It tapered off into silence , leaving Larkin with a cold feeling on the spine . <p> " What was that ? " Gimble said . <p> " Whale , " Larkin answered , too promptly . " The hull can vibrate to their songs , if conditions are right . " <p> The explanation seemed to satisfy them . Before long another call , higher pitched , came from below their feet . It rose , then sank ; as it was trailing away into resonant silence , a third overlapped it in a slow , eerie canon . <p> Around them the fog was changing , pulling back in billowy sworls . Larkin stood watching , feeling oddly remote from her body . Her hand rested limp on the tiller . <p> And then they were there . Sails  --  hundreds of sails . Lugs and spankers , jibs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind . They moved through the fogbank , a roiling cloud of white wings . <p> A shudder ran through Kittiwake , from bowsprit to stem , as if she were in the grip of a strong current . It brought Larkin suddenly to her senses . " After them ! " she shouted . " Up sails ! Undo the towline , Cory ! " <p> Her crew , who had been gazing mesmerized at the mist , sprang to life . Kittiwake 's mainsail shot up the mast , and her jib billowed free . They threw off the lines that bound her to Bobber and the dinghy . The wind caught her wings and sent her flying across the waves . <p> They quickly passed Bobber . The water was foaming by Kittiwake 's hull . Larkin gave a yell of exhilaration . Ahead she could see the dark lines of a ship dodging porpoiselike through the mist . " How many masts ? " she yelled to the foredeck . Gorran held up two fingers . " Too small , " Larkin said . <p> With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thick of the herd . The mist was thinning on every side they were hemmed in by sleek oak bodies and sails piled high as thunderclouds . The little dinghies sailed in their mothers ' wakes , crowding close to each other but never touching . <p> Larkin knew her prey the instant she saw that long , low hull peek from the mist , dark and gleaming like mahogany . The ship had three masts , three white pyramids of sails . Larkin knew instantly that she would call her Wellaway . " Ready the grappling hooks , " Larkin called . " Then hide yourselves ! " <p> The hunters dived for their canvas wraps , leaving Kittiwake 's deck as if empty . Larkin drew a sheet over herself last , crouching down by the tiller , only her hand visible . She peered out tensely through a gap , ignoring the tarry small . <p> Kittiwake was slowly drawing close to their prey . At an unseen signal the herd changed course , synchronized like birds in flight . Larkin was slow tO react , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athwart Kittiwake 's path , making it easy to draw even closer . Larkin held motionless as the shadow of the big ship 's rigging fell across the deck . Wellaway must have noticed them  --  no , not them , but Kittiwake , a lone youngster without any mother near . <p> With a distant jangle of rigging the big ship turned upwind , sails aback , as if to Kittiwake 's unfamiliar smell . Cautiously , so as not to startle her , Larkin nosed closer . Soon Wellaway 's hull loomed over them , only yards away . They came even with the chains where her mainmast shrouds were anchored to her hull . <p> " Now ! " Larkin shouted , throwing off her concealing canvas . <p> The crew erupted from their hiding places . Two had boathooks ; they snagged the chains and heaved Kittiwake close . Grappling hooks flew up and over the ship 's rails to cinch them tight together . Then , shrieking like pirates , the crew swarmed up Wellaway 's side . <p> A tremor passed through the ship 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiver like a horse 's hide plagued with flies . Looking up , she saw the lines contract like muscles . The sails swung round , and Wellaway went tearing off northward . <p> At first all they could do was hang on for dear life . The Ship was bucking and pitching across the waves in a desperate attempt to shake them off . Spray shot up as she thrashed from side to side . Lashed to her side , Kittiwake 's timbers groaned as their hulls smashed together , then plunged apart . <p> Larkin could see her crew scattered across the deck , hanging panic-stricken to anything they could grasp . " Cut the braces ! " she shouted . " We 've got to disable her ! " She seized the cutlass from her own sash and waved it high , so they would understand . <p> Hand over hand she dragged herself back along the gunwale to where the port-side main brace was fastened . Hanging onto the rail with one hand , she began to saw at the line with the cutlass . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slithered around the cleat , letting out the line . Grimly Larkin started to saw at a new spot . The deck lurched then , throwing her against the gunwale so hard the air was knocked from her body ; <p> When she caught her breath , she saw that big Gorran was attacking the starboard main brace across the broad deck from her . He had a hand axe . She saw him bring it down , half severing the cord . As the blow fell , the rope end lashed out at him . He raised an arm to fend it off , trying to swing the axe at it . It whipped his body with vicious force , then tangled in his legs , pulling him off balance . He fell and the rope wrapped around his body . <p> Crying out , Larkin started across the deck . The ship heeled over , the deck tilted , and she slipped back . She scrabbled forward again , pulling herself up the steep slope from handhold to handhold . On the deck ahead , Gorran was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet might as well have been a league away . <p> Brill reached him first , and started hacking away at the rope . Larkin lunged forward and brought her cutlass down on the spot where the axe-blow had almost severed the line . The fibers snapped , and the rope end went suddenly limp . The detached brace whipped and writhed through the air , unable to gain any purchase . The sail to which it was fastened , suddenly loosed , flapped uselessly in the wind . <p> Larkin waved her crew on . " Get the other braces ! " she cried , then turned to help untangle Gorran . He was bruised and nearly senseless ; there was an ugly red welt around his neck where the rope had tried to squeeze the air out of him . Larkin fingered the line with revulsion ; but it was dead now , like normal rope . <p> Shouts from the quarterdeck brought her attention back . Cory and Bedwa were trying to seize control of the tiller . As Larkin was drawing breath to shout a warning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the body and throwing her violently against the taffrail , where she crumpled in a heap . Larkin seized up the length of dead line and clambered aft . A piece of rope slithered under her feet , nearly tripping her ; she hacked it with her cutlass and it drew back . <p> When she tossed the rope to Cory he recoiled , thinking it was live . " Tie a loop in the middle , " she said . " We 'll have to collar the tiller . " <p> He saw instantly what she meant , and tied a slipknot in the rope , leaving a wide loop dangling . They each took an end then ; Larkin passed hers around the starboard rail and stood ready to pull . Cory stood just outside the tiller 's range , the loop dangling from his hand . The tiller stood still , as if to watch him . He tossed the loop over it , and gave a sharp jerk to cinch it . Then he ran to the port rail to pass his end around . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them pulled at once , stretching the rope tight and freezing the tiller 's motion . It tugged frantically , but the rope held it . <p> " Take in your side ; I 'll let out ! " Larkin called . <p> " Not too far ! " Cory warned . <p> " Reposition your line , I want the tiller lashed to the side . " <p> Cory saw the sense in this , and obeyed . Soon they had the tiller helplessly bound to one side . Now the ship was hobbled , she could only go in circles . <p> Even then Wellaway did n't give up ; she fought for her freedom long after she should have known it was hopeless . They worked for an hour before they could strike all the sails and truly cripple the vessel . When it was over and her stately masts stood denuded , the lines dangling in limp dejection , the hunters all collapsed on the quarterdeck in exhaustion . Bedwa had broken several ribs and Gorran still had trouble swallowing ; the rest of them sported an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soaring . They had caught themselves a ship . <p> " She 's lovely , is n't she ? " Larkin said , lying flat , gazing upward at the winter-forest tangle of rigging against the sky . She felt the deck 's smooth teak planking against her back ; it gave a little quiver of exhaustion . <p> " What do you suppose we 'll get for her ? " Brill said . They all stared at him , silent ; no one wanted to think of giving her up yet . <p> " We 'll have to tame her before we can sail her back , " Larkin said . <p> " That will take a while , " Cory said with satisfaction . " She 's pretty feisty . " <p> Larkin tried not to think what would happen then . Once in the world of men , Wellaway would cease to be the wild , living being she was now . She would lose her will , and then her control , and become a thing of wood and hemp , no more animate than Kittiwake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kittiwake ! " <p> Larkin sat up . " Bobber ! I was wondering where they 'd gotten to . " <p> Larkin and her crew lined Wellaway 's rail , waving and calling out , as Bobber came up to the starboard side . It was obvious the other boat had not had the same luck . When Larkin 's crew began calling out teasing comments she said , " Be quiet , " for she saw the anger and accusations in the others ' faces . <p> " We could have had one , too , " one of Bobber 's men called back . " We were almost upon her . " He glanced darkly back at Runar , who stood at the helm . Runar did n't answer ; he looked like he had barely heard . All his attention was on Wellaway . <p> They swarmed up the sides and soon half a dozen versions of the capture story were being told . Runar came aboard last . His deep-sunk eyes looked overcast as he scanned Wellaway 's deck and rigging . <p> " Congratulations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She could only imagine he was jealous . She had succeeded and he had n't . " Everyone did their part , " she said , to dismiss her achievement . <p> " No ! " Runar said ; there was revulsion in his voice . " I had nothing to do with this . " He looked over the disabled ship , his eye snagging on every severed line . <p> Larkin realized it was n't jealousy . In an undertone she said , " What happened ? " <p> " Nothing . " <p> " You almost had one .... ? " <p> " Yes . We were sneaking up on her just right : so cunning the uncles would have been proud . Then I looked up at her , and she was the freest , most beautiful thing I 'd ever seen . It was enough to break your heart . So ... I lost my nerve . " <p> " Runar ! " Larkin said , appalled . It was so unlike him . " We need the ships back in Fairny ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting voice . " So we can buy more trinkets than our neighbors ? " <p> " So we can survive ! The village is dying , the ships can give it life again . What else did we come out here for ? " <p> " Not that , " he said . " I do n't know what for , but not that . " <p> His eyes wandered to Wellaway 's graceful lines again . Unthinkingly , he put out one hand to stroke the curved wood rail . Watching , Larkin felt her own skin shiver at the lightness of his touch . <p> " You can hunt again tomorrow , " she said . <p> " And catch one to sell into a life of slavery ? " he said bitterly . <p> " You ca n't think of that ! " Larkin said fiercely . " It 's something you ca n't control . Just the way the world is . " <p> " What a good excuse , " he said . <p> She felt accused , assaulted . With cold control she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose their freedom . Someone must , to save Fairny . " " Fairny 's not worth it , " he said . <p> He turned away restlessly . " I ca n't stand this . I 'm going back to Bobber . " <p> As he was swinging his leg over the rail he stopped in mid-motion , catching hold of one of the severed lines that dangled in mid-air . He looked at it as if it made a part of him bleed . " Gods , did you have to maul her ? " he said . <p> Larkin did n't answer . Runar dropped down to Bobber 's deck and cast pushing away hard with a long boathook , then raising the mainsail so as to drop far downwind of them . <p> " Where 's he going ? " someone said at Larkin 's side . <p> " I do n't know , " she answered . <p> " Well , good riddance , " she heard ; but when she whirled around angrily to see who had spoken , no one would own up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring supplies over tom Kittiwake and then put the boat on a towline . As they were working they spotted abate mast through the thickening mist on Wellaway 's port , quarter . At first they tried to hail it , thinking it was Bobber , but then realized it was just the dinghy they had set adrift . Soon they had it tied at the ship 's stem . <p> They fixed themselves a hearty meal and lounged on the open deck eating and passing around a pipe of shag . Larkin tried to join in the talk , but her merriment was forced . The voices seemed to jar the silent air . That night they all slept on the open deck , unwilling yet to trust the cabins where it would be easy to get trapped . For a while Larkin lay awake on the quarterdeck , and felt a tear tickling down the side of her face to drip on the planking underneath . <p> She woke in a gray and clammy dawn , thinking she had heard a buoy bell ringing . The fog was thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with white hoarfrost , making her skeleton look like carved ivory . Then the sound came again : a deep , melodious call ringing through the water . Lying on the deck , Larkin could feel it vibrating through her body , and her whole being seemed to feel its yearning . <p> It was like the note of a vast musical instrument , played on a slower scale of time . As if Wellaway were a huge fiddle , resonating . Listening , Larkin thought that if she could dive into such a note she could reach a level of tranquility deeper than light , deeper than wind , down where the motes hung suspended in twilight . Perhaps the slow song was a meditation word , a sound in which an eternal moment lives , sustained , suspended . <p> Someone was shaking her , calling her name . She was sinking deep , crushed by the weight of water . She flailed toward air , following the trail of bubbles her drowning breath had left on the way down . When she broke the surface , consciousness shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Cory was leaning over her , shouting against the flow of shipsong . She wrenched herself to her feet . All around , her crew were lying mesmerized on the deck . The air rang . " Your fiddle , Cory ! " she gasped . " Go get it ! " <p> The first scrape of the bow on the strings snagged at the shipsong like a ripsaw on silk . Cory began to play a hornpipe , strident and out of tune . <p> " Stop that racket ! " The crew were rousing angrily , wincing and holding their hands over their ears . The fiddle 's voice gained strength as the slow bellsong faded before its dissonance . <p> Larkin gathered them all together . " We have to get to work , " she said . " We wo n't be safe till we 're back in our own waters . The first thing is to repair all the lines so we can sail her . Work fast , but be careful . " <p> The splicing went fast with ten hands at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on deck or looped from the spars till the time came to use them . When at last they were ready , Larkin gave the signal to let loose the main course . " One sail at a time , " she said . " The instant she gets unruly , we strike it . " Slowly Wellaway would learn to bend to their control . <p> As the big mainsail billowed out , they all stood alert for an attempt by the ship to break free ; but her rigging hung limp and dead . <p> The day gave no hint as to the way home : the sun was obscured by mist . Larkin set the ship on a starboard reach , gambling that the wind had not shifted since yesterday . Then , it had been from the south ; if she kept it on her right shoulder , she ought to be heading for land : <p> With only one sail up their progress was too slow , so presently Larkin ordered the main topsail set . Still Wellaway did not resist ; it was as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they unbound the tiller she gave only a token struggle . <p> They were barely making headway . Larkin stood at the quarterdeck rail , chafing and staring out into the mist . From time to time it seemed that , hidden in the shifting whiteness , she glimpsed a sail ; but always it dissolved , only a wisp of visible moisture . Each time she felt an obscure pang of disappointment . <p> It was irrational . She had what she wanted , more than she had ever dared to dream . There was no reason to want to see the ships again . <p> The mist watched her silently , opaque in its secrets . She could almost see Runar 's face in it . She had begun to wonder where he had gone , and to worry that he would not be able to find them again . From the ache her heart gave at the thought , she knew what she really feared : that he did not want to rejoin them , now or ever . That he had dissolved in her hands , escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rail , wanting to catch and reel him in . What sort of net would hold a thing of mist ? <p> But the crowding fog hemmed her in , blocked off her options . Like a lifetime 's worth of habits , steering her against her will to a future she had n't chosen , only acquiesced to . She longed to see sails . <p> " Ship ahoy ? someone called . <p> Larkin 's attention snapped back . " Where away ? " <p> " Starboard beam . " <p> She squinted into the mist . Yes , there it was  --  but not a ship . It was Bobber 's familiar outline . Larkin felt a surge of relief . <p> " Runar ! " she called . <p> There was no answer . She could see him now , standing not at the helm but just forward of the mizzen mast , his hair blown back from his face . As she watched , Bobber came about . Her sails trimmed to the altered wind angle  --  and Runar had not laid a hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bobber was alive . No longer was she a poor wooden thing a manmade artifact , obedient and domestic . Somehow , the mist had made her fetal . <p> " Cory ! Brill ! Get the dinghy ready ! " Larkin ordered . <p> Bobber was on a course that would take her past Wellaway 's stem , between her and Kittiwake . " Runar , come about ! " Larkin called from the stem . " You 'll foul the towline ! " <p> He glanced up at her and grinned , a wild-mischievous expression like a beast or a god , She realized then that he was not her ally : he was Bobber 's . They were only yards from the towline when the boat came neatly about , her sails giving a chuckling sound as they luffed in the wind . Runar seized hold of the towline , and his cutlass flashed . <p> " Runar , stop ! " Larkin screamed . He was setting Kittiwake free . <p> He paid her no heed . She raced over to where Cory and Brill had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " We 've got to catch Kittiwake before ... " She did n't finish the thought . <p> They clambered overside . Cory took the helm while Larkin jerked the little sail up . When they rounded Wellaway 's side they saw Bobber standing alongside Kittiwake . Runar was aboard the sloop , raising the sails . <p> " Rot you , you blistered traitor ! " Larkin shouted . <p> Runar jumped back over to Bobber . Instantly her lines tensed and she swooped away from Kittiwake 's side . They could hear Runar laughing . <p> Kittiwake stood still on the waves , her sails flapping . Was it merely the wind , or was she undecided , confused by her new freedom ? Larkin leaned forward as if she could speed the dinghy . She saw Kittiwake 's main sheet tighten tentatively , and the tiller move . <p> " Kittiwake ! " she screamed . <p> Of all the things in life , Kittiwake was the closest to a part of her . She knew every board , every fitting . To lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that yearned for freedom . <p> The sloop hesitated , as if sniffing the wind . A gust blew past , tearing the mist around them like gauze . <p> " Faster , faster ! " Larkin said to the dinghy . <p> The sun broke through , the walls of mist drew back . They were surrounded again by billowy sails , spread in a swift - moving cluster , piled high before the wind . A cry trumpeted through the air . <p> Kittiwake jerked round in elation , tossing her bowsprit . She looked as if she had scented freedom . <p> The thought that she might escape pierced Larkin like honed loneliness . " Kittiwake , do n't leave me ! " she cried out . <p> The boat hesitated , quivering but trapped by the agony in Larkin 's voice . The pause was enough for the dinghy to reach her . But as Larkin readied to jump aboard , Kittiwake shied away . <p> " Let me come aboard , " Larkin said , leaning across the water . " Please . I love you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had together . We 've never let each other down , no matter what . " <p> Carefully Cory steered the dinghy close to the boat 's flank . This time she did n't flinch . Larkin leaped across . She wrapped her arms around the mainmast in a painful rush of gratitude , pressing her face to the warm wood . " Never leave me , " she whispered . " I need you . " <p> The boat rocked as Brill leaped aboard . He reached out to take hold of the tiller , but Larkin said fiercely , " Do n't touch it ! Do n't touch anything . " <p> " But " <p> " She wo n't betray us . " ' <p> There were shouts of alarm across the water . Cory shouted , " Look ! " and they turned . <p> Ahead , two enormous ships had materialized out of the flock , one on each of Wellaway 's flanks . They were matching her speed , too close for safety . If any one of them altered course there would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all three at once , synchronized like a school of fish . A fresh wind blew past , skittering across the waves . Wellaway 's topsails billowed down , loosed from her spars by knots gone slack . Larkin could see small figures rushing around in a panic on her deck . The ship had come alive again . <p> " After them ! " Larkin shouted to Cory . Under her feet the hull shiftcall the mainsail snapped in the wind , then caught . Kittiwake had obeyed her command . <p> " Good girl , " she whispered , one hand stroking the mast . <p> The three ships were heading northwest now , out to sea . The humans aboard could not alter Wellaway 's course without ramming one of her escorts . Despite herself , Larkin smiled at the strategy . It was intimidating , clever teamwork . The ships had learned . <p> Kittiwake 's little sails were straining their hardest , but she was falling behind . Ahead , Wellaway 's sleek flanks strained through the water ; her bow-wave peeled back in foam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unbearably beautiful . <p> Larkin knew then : it was not the ship she wanted . Not the dead wood and flaccid canvas . It was that , the free thing that danced with the wind . The thing that died if she grasped it . <p> " Go free , Wellaway , " Larkin whispered . The wind blew tears from the edges of her eyes . <p> Small black figures were jumping off the ship 's stem like fleas from a dog . Larkin gestured to Cory to make sure he saw the heads bobbing in the water . He waved acknowledgment . <p> " Those cowards ! " Brill growled . " Abandoning ship . " <p> " It 's all right , " Larkin answered . Her voice was strangely calm . <p> Wellaway was escaping , swift as a dream half-captured . She would never haul cargo now , or lie stabled in harbor , or labor in human harness . Larkin looked down to Kittiwake , feeling a pang . " I ought to free you , too , " she said softly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ear . Brill said , " It was her own choice . " <p> " I know , " Larkin said . " I just feel selfish . She could have been free . " <p> " Lucky for us that she loves you , " Brill said . <p> She loves me , Larkin thought . And I love her . Is that bondage ? " <p> By the time they had picked up all the swimmers , the sea around them was empty of sails . <p> THEY TIED up at the tumbledown Fairny dock in silence . No one came out to greet them ; it looked as if their failure were complete . They had set out in two boats , and come back in one . There would be a lot of head-shaking and second-guessing to live through . <p> Larkin let the others go ashore , then lingered to clean and straighten up things that did n't need straightening . <p> Jumber was standing on the dock when she looked up . " What happened ? " he said . <p> " We lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " He took her ? " Jumber said , stunned . <p> " She took him . I ca n't explain , Jumber ; you would n't believe it . But she 's happy . She 's free . They both are . " <p> Jumber looked like a drowning man . He turned and walked away down the dock . Dropping the rope in her hand , Larkin followed him . He was standing looking at the dying village . <p> " I 'm ruined , " he said . <p> The sight of him made her go soft inside , as she had guessed it would . Not once had she feared he would get angry or blame her . It was n't in him . She put a hand on his limp shoulder and suddenly knew she loved him very much . <p> " You 're not mined , " Larkin said . " I 'm going to give you Kittiwake . " <p> Jumber gave a humorless laugh . " She 's not a cargo boat . " <p> " She 's better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from you . " <p> " You wo n't . I 'm coming with her . " <p> It took him several seconds to react . He turned to look as if doubtful he 'd heard right . She put her arms around his neck and pulled him tight , her head on his shoulder . He was solid , comforting , and smelled of wool . <p> " You 're coming ? You mean it ? " Jumber said . <p> " I mean it , " Larkin repeated . <p> He did n't try to kiss her , or say any more . He just held her as if afraid to let go . <p> For an instant her thoughts strayed , and she wondered where Bobber was at that moment , out on the wild sea . She brought her mind back to harbor . <p> " You 're sure ? " Jumber asked again . <p> " I 'm sure , " she said . <p> If it was bondage , it was one she could bear . <p> <p> <p> By Carolyn Ives Gilman <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she works as the Director for Exhibitions and Design for the Missouri Historical Society .
