A COUPLE 'S pre- and post-baby life-styles are usually as different as prime rib and pureed carrots . Just ask any couple who have discovered that with the arrival of their first child life as they knew it permanently faded into an abyss filled with diapers , baby bottles and sleepless nights . Take a look , they 'll tell you , at their before- and after-the-baby weekend plans for proof . Before their blessed event , they regularly dressed up for exciting Saturday nights of wining and dining , dancing and romancing and 3 a.m. curfews . Now , an evening of popcorn , beer and rented videos is considered a hot date , the television gets turned off at midnight and romance is a catch-as-catch-can , iffy event at best . Even so , most parents would n't change their circumstances , or exchange their baby 's smile for all the gold in Fort Knox . Many have dreamed dreams , established careers , bought homes and station wagons  --  all with the eventual arrival of their new baby in mind . Finally , they felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had successfully navigated their way through corporate America . How difficult could it really be to raise a baby ? But no matter how ready a couple feels they are , many are n't prepared for the 24-hours-a-day , 7-days-a-week demands of a newborn . " You know , they tell you you 're not going to get any sleep , " says Yolanda Taylor with a good-natured chuckle . " It 's worse than they say it is . You really do n't get any sleep . " Taylor , a sales assistant for a metal maintenance company , and her husband , Craig , a graphics designer , know what they 're talking about . They 're trying to adjust to life-after-Jahi , their 6-month-old son . Married five years before Jahi Martice was born , the Chicago couple bought a three-bedroom condo four years ago and last year exchanged their two-seater for a station wagon when they learned Yolanda was pregnant . " But nothing can prepare you for the baby 's arrival , " says Craig Taylor . " All the things that we did up front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the baby arrives . " According to marital therapist Dr. Brenda K. Wade , one major surprise experienced by many couples is the lack of time they have to spend together . Couples can address that problem , she says , by setting aside an evening a week as their " date night . " On this night , barring any unforeseen emergencies , parents should take the baby to the baby-sitter , get dressed up and go out , perhaps to the movies , a play or to some other favorite place . Where is not as important as spending some romantic , quality time together . " If you do n't take the time to really be romantic and to keep the relationship strong , " says Dr. Wade , " your love will fade . " Frank Simmons , a chemical engineer , and his wife Michele , an assistant state 's attorney , make a point of going on a date one or two Saturday nights a month . They pack their baby , Ursula Nicole , off to one or the other set of grandparents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We always try and make some time for ourselves , " says Michele , " and remember that we were Frank and Michele , the couple , before we became Ursula 's parents . " And since the Chicago couple 's household has n't been the same since Ursula arrived 17 months ago , couple-time is not always easy to find . No area of the Simmons ' lives has been left untouched , they say , from their careers to the time she spends reading and he spends working in their home office . Dr. Wade says couples can sometimes feel resentful about the time demands their baby is making on their lives . While those feelings , if occasionally experienced , are normal , they are often a signal of out-of-balance lives . " It 's important to know that when you have a baby , you are signing up for a juggling act , " says Dr. Wade . " The trick is to keep your lives balanced . That means making time on the schedule for you as an individual to take care of yourself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even a couple 's basic , everyday routine is subject to change based totally on the changes their baby is currently experiencing . Michele McDowell Simmons says that just as she and Frank got accustomed to Ursula waking every three hours , she started sleeping through the night . And Craig and Yolanda Taylor say that getting up and down with Jahi throughout the night leaves them feeling tired and worn out . " But then he smiles at me , " says Craig , " and it makes it all worth it . " A baby is often a wonderful , welcome addition and can round out what is , in every other respect , a picture-perfect life together . But being prepared mentally and emotionally for beginning a family is absolutely necessary . " You ca n't be overly prepared for your baby 's arrival , " says Yolanda . " It 's not possible . " Add to being prepared a lot of love , a bit of humor and a flexible attitude and your post-baby days , experts say , will work out just fine . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
