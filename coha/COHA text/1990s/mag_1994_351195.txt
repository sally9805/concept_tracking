On The Downward Spiral , the bracing new album by Nine Inch Nails , the mood starts off grim and deteriorates fast . The record opens with a volley of gunshot-like reports that mutate into the techno thrash of Mr. Self Destruct , on which composer-singer Trent Reznor screams , " I am the voice inside your head  --  and I control you . " <P> The downbeat slide continues on Piggy , which uses a warped reggae pulse punctuated by slamming drums and Reznor 's insinuating vocal to conjure an uneasy atmosphere of malice , and on Heresy , in which Reznor sings , " God is dead and no one cares/ If there is a hell I will see you there . " Subsequent cuts evoke paranoia , murder and finally suicide . The lyrics on the title cut include the lines " He could n't believe how easy it was He put the gun into his face/ Bang ! / So much blood for such a tiny hole . " <P> This is not music for the squeamish  --  or even the optimistic . Meshing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synthetic sheen of techno , The Downward Spiral is a 14-song , 65-minute howl of somebody falling into the void . What keeps it from being just another nauseating exercise in shock rock is the intelligence and creative force behind its dire sound . On March of the Pigs , for example , layers of shifting static are suddenly broken by a lyrical piano riff that blooms like a flower through cracked pavement before the wall of noise crushes it again . <P> Reznor maintains that the message of The Downward Spiral is ultimately uplifting . " I think the very act of wanting to discover and uncover unpleasantries is itself positive , " he says . " The act of trying to rid yourself of these demons , to prepare yourself for the worst , is a positive thing . " If only Kurt Cobain , who purveyed a similarly despairing view of the world , had looked at things that way .
