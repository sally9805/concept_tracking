Now , after five days , the army lifts the curfew . <P> In a bright June morning , all the locked-up normalities come tumbling into the streets of Nablus  --  the fruits and vegetables , the figs and grape leaves and fragrant mint , the baklava with its hovering bees , the butchered goats and lambs and live chicks in cardboard boxes , rectangles of softly agitating yellow fluff . The narrow alleys of the Casbah fill with the smells and bustle of marketing after curfew . Palestinian life in the steep-sided hills of the occupied West Bank makes one of its dreamlike passages back to the state of mind in which , for a moment , it feels normal . <P> Then , just at noon , news shoots through the Casbah , an articulate electricity : there was an Israeli army raid a moment ago  --  one activist killed , many captured . <P> Now groceries tumble back behind shutters . Mothers drag children , fleeing up the lanes . Adolescent boys collect on corners , muscles jumping , vibrating for revenge . <P> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he is wanted by the army , like his best friend who was killed just now  --  stops for a second , his body 's engine racing , in front of a shop with a mannequin in its window dressed in a stately white wedding gown . The fugitive speaks with a distracted courtesy , wanting to be polite but needing to flee for his life , and then vanishes into an alley . The owner of the shop slams down his steel curtain over the window with the wedding gown . The mannequin bride goes blank . <P> Curfew again : Nablus returns to its motionless antiworld , its un-Palestine . <P> The glaziers of Jerusalem will be rich if the intifadeh goes on like this . They charge $1,500 to install car windows that are shatter-resistant . People are paying . The Palestinian uprising is 2 1/2 years old . It has hardened into a dreary , bitter ritual . The reciprocal stoning and beating obey Newton 's Third Law of Motion  --  for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction . Each side has found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides , the leadership , such as it is , grows more evasive , craven and empty . In a war of victims , no one plays the grownup . Among the Palestinians , effective moral authority now has a median age of 14 or 15 and a good throwing arm . Fathers and grandfathers have signed over their moral duties to the children in the streets . The traditional patriarchy begins to disintegrate . The Palestine Liberation Organization still serves as banner and facade , but many Palestinians believe that it is increasingly feckless , corrupt and out of touch . The failures of leadership on either side of the struggle collaborate to create a sense of hopelessness . Hamas , the fundamentalist Islamic movement , feeds handsomely upon the ambient despair . <P> Some American Plains Indians in their late 19th century twilight took to ritual " ghost dancing " in the hope of ridding themselves of the white man . The intifadeh is either ghost dancing or nation building , and sometimes it is both simultaneously . It has crystallized the Palestinians ' sense of themselves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , incandescent but insubstantial.
