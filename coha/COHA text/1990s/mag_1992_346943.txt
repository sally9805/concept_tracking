Q. A year ago , various Democratic heavyweights opted out of the race because you were so far ahead in the polls . <P> A. Hard to remember those days . <P> Q. And now you 're headed for a convention that many of us , and you also probably , thought would be a kind of coronation . What happened ? <P> A. The economy . <P> Q. That 's the only thing ? <P> A. I think so . If this economy were growing at 5% , we would n't have these problems . There 'd still be enormous problems facing the country , but in terms of standing , we would n't be in this shape . I 'm absolutely convinced of it . <P> Q. Do you find that the American people do n't seem grateful enough for what you have accomplished ? <P> A. No , I think they may be unaware of what we 've accomplished , but I could n't put it in terms of lack of gratitude . <P> Q. Do you think that in some kind of weird way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well over there that the nation expected you to handle domestic affairs equally well . <P> A. I think people do n't recognize the difference in how you handle a foreign policy issue , where you can just take action on your own , and how you handle a domestic issue , where in almost every instance you have to get help from what has proved to be a very recalcitrant Congress . <P> Q. That would account for the assessments of people who are n't plugged in , but you 've got a lot of Republican supporters who 've said some really harsh things . <P> A. Well , they 've said harsh things in terms of feeling pressure on the economy . I come back to the economy as the main problem  --  not the only one , but the main problem . <P> Q. Vin Weber , co-chairman of your campaign , was quoted the other day as saying , " The President does n't like the idea of doing battle with Congress and does n't like the idea of mobilizing the country to get Congress to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , that 's fixing to change real fast . <P> Q. How so ? <P> A. Because I 'm going to take the case to the American people about the new Congress . And there will be a new Congress anyway because of the numbers of seats ( ( being vacated ) ) . I want it to be a newer than new Congress . So that will be joined , much as Truman joined it in 1948 . We want to move this country forward to solve the problems of health care , solve the problems of education , solve the problems of crime in the neighborhoods . And the way to do it is to give me a new Congress with which I can work . <P> I think the people know that I 've held out my hand to Congress and it 's been a very frustrating experience . One of the reasons that I think we 're in perceived difficulty is that I kept trying to work with this Congress all year , when I 've been getting bashed by the candidates on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've left the field of combat to the opposition . That is going to change . Not only as it affects the man I 'll be running against , but as it affects the Congress itself . <P> Q. Quayle has gone a little beyond what you have said about giving you a Republican Congress to say , " End divided government ; either give Congress a Democratic President or give us a Republican Congress . " Are things so stuck that you would second that view ?
