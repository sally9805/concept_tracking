SOPHIE PRESSED A FOLDED PAPER into Frank 's hand and said , " Do n't read this till after the plane takes off . " Then she kissed him , her dark bangs brushing his nose , and walked down the ramp to the plane . She was wearing a clingy knit dress and a purple felt hat , two take-on bags draped over her shoulder . After she was gone a fog of musk still hung over him . He sat down in a molded plastic seat , watching the door until a ticket agent closed it . Then , before the plane could possibly have taken off , he opened the note . <p> " Look in the hall closet on top of the winter gloves and scarves , " Sophie had written . When he got back to the silent house , he opened the hall closet . There was a hardcover copy of Belling The Cat : The Search for God . It was a book of cartoons . In the flyleaf was scrawled , " Do n't forget to laugh . Love Sophie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going to spend a year apart . She had quit teaching eighth grade to go on an extended tour of the Orient , Russia , and Poland . Several weeks later Frank took a leave of absence from his law firm , packed a U-Haul trailer with his clothes and books and Sophie 's blue pottery dishes , and drove to upstate New York , where he planned to read for a master 's degree in religious studies . <p> Their two sons , both of whom had graduated from college and were living in New York , did n't pry . Only Kristen , the youngest , who was ready to begin her junior year in college , asked questions . And she waited until Sophie was gone . <p> It was early September , still deceptively sultry . Frank and Kristen ranged through the Oak Park house , sorting books , clothes , utensils , getting ready for the young couple who were coming to rent for a semester . <p> " Mother said you should take the blue dishes , " Kristen said . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I promised you 'd take them . " <p> " They 're too heavy , Krissy . " <p> " Mother said they 'd make you remember her . " Kristen gave him a beseeching look . He sighed , picked up the heavy box , and carried it to his station wagon . He wished that Sophie had wanted to be remembered by something lighter : a plant , maybe , or a book . The dishes were an intrusion and a responsibility . But that was Sophie . <p> When he returned , Kristen was sitting on the floor , shuffling through record albums . " What is somebody your age going to do with a degree in religious studies , anyway ? " she asked . <p> " Nothing , " Frank said . <p> " So why are you going ? " She looked up , her long hair all different colors of blond , her bare feet dirty , her plum-colored T-shirt stained . <p> " There is such a thing as learning for its own sake , " Frank explained , hurling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that 's old-fashioned . " <p> " All right , then why are you leaving Mother ? " <p> " I 'm not leaving your mother , " he said . " At least that 's not the point . " <p> " Then what 's going on ? " <p> " People need change . And we 're people . Even if we happen to be your parents . " <p> " I thought you wanted to raise us . " <p> " We did . We raised you . " <p> " Not me . I 'm not done yet . " <p> " You 're pretty close . " She shook her head , flinging tears out of her eyes . " Where am I supposed to stay when I come home at Christmas ? " <p> " In my apartment , " Frank said . " It 's only a couple of hours from you . You can even come home for Thanksgiving this year . " <p> " That 's not home . " <p> " Sweetheart , " he said cajolingly . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have the right ? " he asked . <p> " You probably have n't noticed , " she said . " You 're the only father I have . " She sullenly laid a Joni James album on the pile to keep . <p> " Who 's going to listen to that ? " he asked . <p> " Me . " <p> " What 's the point of this if you do n't throw anything away ? " <p> " I 'm hanging onto everything I can . " In her love of the physical world , Frank thought , Kristen sounded like her mother . <p> Frank had spent a quarter of a century raising children , years cluttered with strollers and piano practice and Little League and school conferences . He and Sophie had been companionably , routinely responsible . The children , the house , his small law firm  --  they had required endless hovering , patching up , encouraging . <p> But he anticipated the next year almost physically now , as though he carried it in the breast pocket of his shirt . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something better . He believed it was still possible to do that . He believed the soul at the beginning was like a larva which , with diligence and habit , might become a caterpillar , and finally , perhaps , a graceful butterfly . This had little to do with religion , as most people thought of it . It had to do with education and culture , the best that had been thought and said . Good little bookstores and perceptive teachers , the worn mahogany reading room he imagined finding at a university . <p> He could n't remember whether he or Sophie had decided to leave first . He thought they had come to it at the same time . It was that way with them sometimes . When they were sitting in the living room on a late fall day , they would sometimes get up at exactly the same moment to close the window . <p> Sophie loved new foods , bright costumes , dancing , architecture , street fairs , drama , anything full of pageantry . She had always wanted to travel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dentist 's office , a whole issue devoted to China . Crisp brown ducks hanging by their tiny heads in the windows of restaurants . Luminous red enameled boxes filled with rose petals . Misty landscapes with pajama-clad Chinese farmers . <p> She told Frank about it as they were getting ready for bed . It was May , and the moist air was heavy with cherry blossoms . Frank was setting the alarm . <p> " And I could n't even imagine being in China , " Sophie was saying . " I began to realize how much there is to see and do . " She stepped to the louvered door of the closet , pulling her silk shirt off and reaching for her nightgown . " I thought , am I going to teach junior high school social studies for the rest of my life and then just die without having seen all this ? " <p> Frank was mildly surprised . Not by the fact that she wanted to travel . The immediate effect of her words was to make him think about the familiarity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just then whisking under the nightie . Before he was twenty-two , he had never seen anything so beautiful . Now , even during sex , he did n't think the same way about her body . Someday he would regret having forgotten for so many months at a time to really look at her . <p> Sophie had glossy dark hair , burnished skin , and sly black eyes . There was a languor about the way she moved , about the way she was reaching for the book from the nightstand at that moment , wetting her finger against her lips , taking her time paging to the place she had left off . <p> " I ca n't leave the firm , " he said . <p> " We 're up to our shoulders in our own graves , Frank ! " <p> " Come on , Sophie . Do n't be dramatic . " <p> " A grave is nothing but a deep rut . We 've been in the same rut for twenty years ! " <p> He took off his shirt . " If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China . I would want to read . " <p> " Just read ? " she said . <p> " What do you mean , just ? " <p> " It 's not seeing the Andes . It 's not eating pt . " <p> " There are a few dozen books I 'd like to really understand . " <p> " Look , " she said , twisting her face toward him and closing her eyes . <p> " What ? " <p> " All these wrinkles ! " <p> " Phooey ! " The language of his great-aunts . Sophie , who hated to be reminded of them , grimaced . <p> Frank had been raised by old women . When he was seven his mother had been committed to a mental institution and his father could n't keep him . So he had been sent to live with his mother 's mother in Remurs , Minnesota . His grandmother and her two sisters owned a big , dark Victorian house with overstuffed chairs and sofas that had scratchy caramel-colored doilies on their arms . <p> Grandmother Mattie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , to become better , to live a truly good life . <p> One night when he had just arrived in the big house , he was lying in bed , half-sick with longing for Betty Ferringer , the girl who sat across from him in his new school . Aunt Hilda 's voice , high and indignant , broke into his reverie . " So that 's why you let that dirty man steal our books ! " Aunt Hilda had not been able to find the Biblical concordance in their library . <p> " Borrow , Hilda . He borrows them , " Grandmother Mattie said . <p> " He kept The Complete Guide to Wildflowers for six years . " <p> " Eli would be pleased someone is reading his books . " <p> " He 's a thief . I think we should get a lock fixed on the library door . " <p> They were talking about the tramp . From time to time , usually in rainy weather , some unknown man , probably a shell-shocked soldier from World War II , opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and helped himself to books . This had been going on for so many years no one could remember exactly when it started . Usually he came when the house was empty , but Grandmother Mattie had seen him several times , most notably one Sunday when she had been home from church with the flu . She said he was very thin with black high-top tennis shoes and a plaid flannel shirt . His name was Tom . She urged him to have zwieback and tea with her , but he seemed to be in a hurry . He asked if he could borrow a novel by Albert Camus . <p> " No one here will ever deny you books , " she reported telling him . He took one of the novels . Which one , she could n't remember . <p> " And now he has the concordance , " Hilda screeched . <p> " For heaven 's sake , Hilda , you have all the books you need . Why begrudge Tom ? " Mattie 's voice was soft and she pronounced Tom like Time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Hilda shrieked . " His name is n't Time ! " <p> " The need of the human ego to control everything , " Grandmother Mattie murmured . " What do we need with all those books ? " <p> Grandmother Mattie was right , Frank thought . He himself had felt irritated when he found his grandfather 's anatomy book missing . But what right did he have to hundreds of books when others had none ? <p> Most days his Grandmother Mattie had some female complaint which confined her to bed , where she sat up , her chin tilted high to clear her three-inch starched lace collar . Her skin was wrinkled as wax paper that had been wadded up and smoothed out again , and she smelled like camphor . All day she tatted  --  tablecloths , doilies , shawls  --  and sipped tea from a fragile light-blue flowered cup which chattered as she set it back on the table beside the bed . <p> Aunt Hilda , her sister , with gray distraught hair , lumbered in and out , shooing the orange cat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeping the rugs . She bumped into things . Whenever she passed Frank she would glare fiercely at him out of green eyes . <p> The oldest sister , Aunt Irene , was tall and grave and tragically beautiful . All day she called out orders to Aunt Hilda , who needed help because , as Aunt Irene explained to anyone who would listen , Aunt Hilda had never been right in the head . <p> There were no men in the house . Grandmother Mattie 's husband had died , and Aunt Hilda had never married . Although Aunt Irene had married at some point , she had long since ceased to live with her husband for a reason Frank had never been allowed to know . From hints , he gathered it had something to do with crossing a boundary . Either he had taken orders for the priesthood ( all the sisters were Methodists ) , or he had declared himself a homosexual , or perhaps he had run off to sea . <p> The three sisters had devotions together every night , kneeling by the fat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they started reading straight through the Bible and they kept to a schedule that got them through Revelations by December thirty-first . <p> The evening Frank arrived by train , they were on the Abominations in Leviticus . <p> After he had watched alone by the smeary window in the frosty station for a long time , Aunt Irene arrived in the sisters ' old spinach-colored Dodge with the running boards . He helped her heave his five suitcases into the jaws of the car 's trunk . Then he climbed into the back seat where Aunt Hilda inspected him . <p> When they got home , it was dusk , time for devotions . The sisters sat Frank down while Grandmother Mattie read from the Bible . The passage said he must avoid the cloven hoof and all manner of unclean things . He did n't know what the cloven hoof was . That night he dreamed he was dancing with JoAnn Knox , who had grown a cloven hoof out of her forehead . <p> Frank was allowed to read any time he wanted , but not to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . He spent so much time with books that the voices of their authors filled his head . His grandmother and his aunts received by mail the Reader 's Digest book of the month , and there were also those philosophy and theology books which lined the study of his dead grandfather , who had been a Methodist preacher . Frank had read Descartes and Billy Graham and Martin Luther , all scrambled up together , before he was old enough to shave . He found pictures of them in The Book of Knowledge , and sometimes at night he imagined them shuffling into his bedroom . <p> Other things his grandmother allowed him to do : listen to Sergeant Preston of the Yukon on the radio and sit out in the duck blind on the edge of the property and watch quail and ducks in the fall . He could also play checkers with Grandmother Mattie in the milky light of the bedroom . To do that , he had to balance the red-and-black board over the mountains and valleys of her white chenille spread . When his grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and start tipping the men off . Once this happened and Mattie set the pieces back wrong . She made Frank a king he had n't earned and placed two of his men too close to her king row . <p> " That 's not the way it was ! " he objected . <p> She looked at him in surprise . " I 'm sure it was , Franklin . " She waved her thin hand with the gold rings , signaling that he should hurry up and move . He watched the blue vein throbbing in her temple , wondering why Grandmother Mattie would lie to him . <p> From then on , when he played checkers with Grandmother Mattie , he observed that she was making moves designed to lose . He was disappointed and embarrassed . Every game he had so proudly won was now subject to question . Not even subject to question . Not to be counted . He began to realize that he had been mistaken about winning . Winning was simple . And it was only for simple people , like Aunt Hilda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in everything , was to be good . <p> In a way it could be said that Frank had always studied , that he had decided to study long before Sophie ever announced that she was planning to travel . Enrolling in religious studies was just a continuation of his lifelong search for goodness . His marriage and his fathering three children seemed to him , in retrospect , an improbable diversion . <p> Except that from the first time Frank met Sophie , he could n't take his eyes off her . His roommate at the University of Minnesota was Sophie 's oldest brother , Lars , a business major who was also interested in philosophy . Lars introduced him to Sophie when the three of them were lugging boxes into the dorm in the fall of the boys ' senior year . <p> " Sophie , Frank . Frank , Sophie . " Lars whooped as he hoisted a box of books over the banister . <p> Sophie , who was ready to go to the car to get another box , turned , her face flushed and sweaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Holding the hall door open for Lars , Frank grunted , " Hello . " <p> " You 're my brother 's roommate ? " Sophie asked bluntly . <p> " For this year . " <p> " Pleased to meet you . " Sophie gazed at him curiously . She was wearing fashionable pink pedal pushers , a starched and ironed white blouse , bobby socks , and penny loafers . She had long red fingernails . Her lips , which were full and intriguingly off-center , were colored in with flaming lipstick . <p> " Do you go to school here ? " Frank asked , feeling uncomfortable in his ill-fitting plaid shorts . <p> " She goes to Carleton , " Lars said , closing the room door . " Let 's stop and eat . " <p> They got into the old gray Studebaker , the two boys in front . " We 've been working hard all day . We ought to eat in a nice restaurant , " Sophie suggested . <p> " Where ? " Lars asked , glancing at Sophie in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at Frank for approval . <p> " I guess we could . " Frank was unused to eating in restaurants at all . Sophie took out a pack of Camels and lit one , then slowly wiggled herself back into the seat , crossed her legs , and closed her eyes with a look of satisfaction so delicious it was comic . " Do you want a cigarette ? " she asked with a slight , flirty lilt . <p> " Thank you , no . I do n't smoke . " <p> " Tell Sophie what you were telling me , " Lars said , keeping his eyes on the road . <p> " What ? " Sophie bent slowly forward and leaned against the front seat , the length of her arm feeling like a pleasurable burn across his shoulder . <p> " Yesterday I found an intruder in my grandmother 's house . " <p> " Intruder ! " Sophie said , her speckled green eyes large . " Do you know what ? You sound like a book ! " Frank blushed . <p> " Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , and we 've all been on vacation at the lake , so the house has been closed up . But I had to come back to the house to get books I needed here at school . When I walked into the library , I saw a man standing there . " <p> " Jeepers ! What did you do ? " <p> " I said , ' Can I help you ? ' " They laughed . <p> " Well , he looked at me  --  he was unshaven and he was wearing a brown sweater with a hole in the sleeve . He said he wanted to borrow Kant 's Critique of Pure Reason . " <p> " What is the Critic of Pure Reason ? " Sophie asked . <p> " Critique , " Lars corrected her . " Who wants to know ? " <p> " Me , " Sophie said pugnaciously . <p> " What do they teach you at Carleton ? " Lars asked , looking at her in the rearview mirror . <p> " Be quiet , " Sophie said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's hard to read . " <p> " Why did n't you call the police ? " Sophie asked . Frank put down the sun visor . " This man has been borrowing books from our library for twenty years . " Sophie stared at him . " Your grandmother lets him walk in and take her stuff ? " <p> " Just books . " Sophie gave him a strange look . Then she peered at herself in the rearview mirror and straightened her hair . <p> " I 'd never seen him before . I wanted to talk to him about Kant , But pretty soon he made an excuse and left . " <p> Lars pulled into the parking lot and said , " He could n't take your theory about Kant , old man . " <p> " I would n't let somebody come in my house like that , " Sophie said . " You probably surprised him just before he stole the silver . " <p> " Nah . " <p> " That 's peculiar . Did you know that you 're peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshened her lipstick in the rearview mirror , then pressed her lips together . Frank and Lars tumbled out of the car and waited for her . <p> When she got out , she said , " I think I know who that man is . " <p> " You do ? " Frank asked . <p> " His mother used to be a philosophy professor at Carleton . " <p> " How do you know ? " Lars said . <p> " No kidding . Her son was shell-shocked in the war . She 's really old . She still walks around campus with a little mustard-colored cloth bag . She takes things out of the bag and gives them away . Nothing expensive , and you never know what it 'll be . A carrot . A necklace with blue stones , once . Lots of books . " <p> Sophie was squinting in the sun . " Once this lady gave a friend of mine a parakeet . You would n't believe a philosophy professor could get that wacky . Right ? But she did . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found he could n't . She was fresh-looking , clearly delineated as a crayon drawing that had been outlined . Looking at her made him feel dizzy , and so he forced himself to look away . <p> " Your friend , the burglar , " she said . " I bet he has to find books for his mother . Because she gives all her books away . " " She does ? " Frank mumbled . <p> " She gives everything away . " Sophie put her hand on Frank 's arm . He could hear his blood cascade . <p> Was this girl telling the truth ? It did n't matter . <p> That was when she had fallen in love with him , Sophie confessed the night she was packing her last clothes to travel . <p> " Why ? " Frank asked , sitting on the bed . He remembered how inept and foolish he had felt . In young Sophie 's worldly gaze Frank had seen himself for the first time as simple , pious , and boorish . Sophie had helped to reveal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that needed work . They showed up by contrast with her . <p> Frank watched Sophie as she knelt in front of the suitcase and folded her gold lam dress . She had worn it the night before at a dance . <p> " I loved you because you believed in that burglar so much , " Sophie explained . He laughed . <p> " Chaste , " she said . <p> " Chaste ? I was a virgin . " <p> " Oh , I do n't mean that . You believed in goodness . " Sophie closed the suitcase and zipped it , then snapped the lock . " I did n't believe in anything . I thought we 'd be a match for one another , " Sophie said , standing up . <p> " And we have been , " Frank said , but Sophie went to call the airline and confirm her flight . Frank wondered in a hazy way whether Sophie would actually return home after a year of traveling . If she did n't , what would he do ? <p> When he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autumn . He rented a tiny apartment . Nothing on the walls . A monk 's narrow bed . He missed Sophie , their chatting , the way they had often worked side by side in the house . But he practiced quiet and abstinence . He 'd brought his old Bach records , but even in the fugues , he found a simple purity . <p> He unpacked Sophie 's dishes and dutifully stacked them in the kitchen cabinets . But after a month he realized he did n't like to use them . They were too heavy to wash by hand ( he had taken a one-bedroom without a dishwasher to keep down the rent ) . They were breakable . And they were a color blue that began to seem too bright . He packed the dishes into a cardboard box and bought a starter set of gray Melmac . <p> Frank got chatty letters from China for several months , then from Russia for several more . Arriving in Japan , Sophie wrote that she was bewitched . For six months she stayed there . She sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which she said slipped away from her tongue like oysters . She said she had started wearing orange-and-blue kimonos . She was taking classes in flower arranging . <p> Frank would read half her letter , then put it down and gaze out the window at snow falling on the lawn , which sloped blank and white toward an edge of black conifers in the distance . In comparison to the quiet purity of snow , the details of Sophie 's letters seemed trumped-up and confused . Her interests came and went unpredictably . He wondered whether she had always been that way , or whether seeing and eating and hearing so much had changed her . He wrote to her about Phoenician and Sumerian texts and about his growing fascination with Claude Lvi-Strauss . <p> Sophie 's latest aerogram had been moved from the table when Frank woke up one morning in March . It lay on the floor . That was his first clue that he had been robbed . There were no signs of a break-in . The robber must have had a key  --  was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . The telephone was gone , and Frank 's briefcase . Also , the cardboard box of Sophie 's blue pottery dishes , which were irreplaceable because they had been made for her by a potter who was now dead . <p> They had been stolen because they were all packed up , ripe for the taking . It was his own fault . He would have to tell Sophie . But later . He could n't write it . <p> No matter what he said , Sophie would be able to detect that he did n't feel the loss of the dishes personally . She would be hurt by that . She would ask him how a robber could have taken time to pack those heavy pottery dishes and he would have to admit that they had been sitting in a box , that he , in fact , was n't using them . <p> He looked around the room . He had already been alone for nine months , studying several dozen great books . A deep meditative spirit had settled over him . He sometimes remembered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments on a mortgage . He wore blue jeans and sweatshirts , and he ate bread and honey and cottage cheese for dinner most nights . Although he knew he could n't , he sometimes imagined going on , perhaps enrolling in anthropology , maybe teaching a little . <p> Sophie called at ten o'clock on a Friday night in late April . Their house , she said , had been left in fairly good condition by the Klines , who had moved out , as they had planned , in January . Sophie had returned unexpectedly to the States to attend the funeral of an aunt in New Orleans . Would Frank go with her ? <p> " I ca n't . " <p> " Frank ? I have to be there . And I do n't want to go alone . " <p> " I 'm in the middle of papers . " But something in his chest whirred up like a flock of starlings . <p> " You 've always put words between yourself and people you loved . " Her voice pulsed with frustration . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get buried without me . " <p> " Frank , it 's Mother 's only sister . It 's important . " <p> " I have two exams next week . " <p> " It 'll be New Orleans . Think of the purple rhododendrons . Think of the way the wisteria smells at this time of year . We could celebrate together . " <p> " Celebrate what ? " he asked . <p> " Life . Being together again . " <p> " If I do n't finish I wo n't get my degree , Sophie . " <p> " You said you did n't care about a degree . You said all you wanted was to read and learn . " <p> " I 've changed my mind , " he ventured boldly . <p> " You have ? " <p> " I might want to go on . In anthropology . Have n't you been reading my letters ? I wrote you about the interesting work being done in anthropology . " <p> " It 's always like that . You think the truth is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you read . " <p> He was too taken aback to reply . <p> " You 've been deluding yourself with that all your life . " <p> " How would you know ? You never read . " <p> " You ca n't find truth in a stack of papers ! Why do n't you give up and come ? " She went on in a coaxing voice . " Lars and Jody will be coming in from Los Angeles . " <p> " I 'm going to stay here . " He made his voice sound final . <p> " You 're definitely staying there ? " <p> " Please tell Lars that I 'm sorry I missed him . " Sophie was quiet . <p> " And your sister , too . " <p> " I will . " She sounded clipped but civil . <p> They were silent , then she asked , " Are you ever coming home ? " <p> " When my exams are over , I 'm coming home . " <p> " When will that be ? " <p> " The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to skip graduation to be there early . " " On Saturday ? " <p> " On Saturday if you want . " <p> " Well , can you get here early that Saturday ? " <p> " If you want me to . " <p> " I want you to . " Her voice released a little into restrained tenderness . <p> Kristen wrote to him in a joyful , loopy scrawl from Middlebury on a postcard which bore a bright blue picture of the school 's ski team . The card said Sophie wanted Frank to arrive home early because she was giving him a surprise graduation party . Kristen was meddling in her parents ' lives with characteristic thoughtfulness , not wanting Frank to disappoint Sophie by being late , not wanting him to be so surprised himself that he could n't enjoy the party . What Kristen wanted , Frank understood , was what children always wanted , a home intact that she could sink into comfortably whenever she needed it . <p> On a brilliant Saturday morning  --  it was early in May  --  Frank pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree in the front yard had grown two feet and its pink flowers sent out a sweetness that nearly made him weep . He pulled the handbrake , sat looking at the tree in silence for several minutes , then opened the car door . <p> Kristen and Sophie , seeing him coming , ran to meet him . Sophie had bare feet with painted toenails and a vivid tangerine-colored , many-layered dress that made her look as though she were a huge flower . As she ran , rustling , Sophie held her arms out to Frank . He trod on her toes , leapt back in apology , then held her clumsily in his arms . He leaned down to kiss her , but she bent her head at the last moment and his kiss landed in her hair . Kristen took her turn hugging him . Then he saw his oldest son , Mike , and Mike 's wife , Denise . Then the other son , Adam . Everybody . They had flown , driven , called , planned , connived for his graduation . The family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners . <p> They sat down in the backyard on canvas lawn chairs and jabbered . Adam was thinking about getting married . Sophie 's life had been changed by seeing the East . She claimed she was finished with teaching and had been looking into consulting for an airline , which would allow her free travel whenever she wanted . Kristen had been gathering materials from law schools . They drank lemonade , and high-spirited laughter exploded like firecrackers . Frank sat gazing at them dreamily , wondering how he came to have anything to do with such handsome , energetic people . <p> " The dishes , Frank ! " It was Sophie , leaning over him , her breasts tan and firm . " We 've got so many people coming , we need the blue pottery . " <p> " I meant to tell you , " Frank said . " They were stolen . " <p> " Stolen ? " <p> " My apartment was broken into . " <p> Sophie dropped into a chair , howling . She covered her face with her hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed through the group around Sophie like the ring that spreads after a stone is tossed into the water . " Oh , God , they 're all gone ? " <p> " I 'm sorry . " <p> " Every last one ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> Seeing that this was a private matter between the two of them , the children started moving away , beginning to talk self-consciously , and then drifted into the house . <p> " Sophie , I 'll get you others . " <p> " You ca n't . No dishes will ever be like those . " <p> " I know . " He knew that he did n't understand her physical connection with things of the world . She hugged herself in grief . There were goose bumps on her arms . <p> " How could somebody have packed them all up ? A robber stayed there and packed them ? " <p> " He had a long time , " Frank lied . " I was out .

" <p> At noon the guests began to come , bearing food for lunch . Pickled herring , potato salad with olives and dill , peach pie , marinated chicken for the grill , cleaned and cut vegetables with avocado dip ( the radishes looked like roses ) , red and white wine . The Elliots , the Samuelsons , the Browns , Laura Kline , Fred Bowers , who had been widowed in the last year . Gus Ost and his new bride . Someone brought a tiny baby girl . She was ogling Frank nearsightedly from his lap , where Kristen had gently laid her . Adam went into the house and the sounds of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Swing Low , Sweet Chariot . " The record had always been Adam 's favorite , one of Sophie 's records which Adam had threatened to steal when he left home . <p> Sophie brought Frank a piece of cheesecake , his favorite dessert , her special recipe with raspberries . She had gotten out the Lenox and cleaned the silver for the party . He had been watching her . She was still deeply beautiful , fluttering from one person to another , trying to please , gossiping , passing out food , throwing a frisbee with one of the young boys . <p> " Look at you , " Sophie said as he took the cheesecake she held out to him . " You look better than ever . " She had momentarily put behind her the loss of the blue pottery . <p> He knew she wanted to have this effect on him  --  his ears tingling , his face flushing . She patted him on the shoulder . " Did you notice ? Everybody 's here , " she said . " That 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too rich after all his plain food . He could n't eat it , even though , in a valiant effort to please her , he tried . <p> After they finished lunch , they arranged their chairs for the mock graduation ceremony . Juanita Brown carried a cardboard box full of noisemakers around the group . Everyone experimented with these , banging and blowing and tootling and beeping . Kristen brought Frank a black robe and a mortarboard hat which he put on while everyone cheered and honked and clapped . She arranged the tassel and whispered , " Mother wrote the graduation address and she spent a lot of time on it , so please laugh . " Then she pushed him gently into a chair which had been placed at the center of the semicircle . Sophie got up to deliver the speech . <p> " Esteemed graduate , " Sophie began , " massed as you are in your black and solemn robes . " She looked significantly at him , alone in the middle of everyone and trying not to squirm . " I salute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " She held up a twenty-dollar bill , which Gus Ost had just slipped her . " And for receiving this honorarium . " <p> Everyone guffawed . Mike raised a large cardboard sign on which he had lettered APPLAUSE . Everyone clapped . <p> " For as you grow older and the childish thoughts of youth fade forever away , you will see , as those who have come before you have seen , that it is not the adulation of the many or the praise of the few that truly educated men most cherish . It is the chance to continue being a student . " <p> Laughter . The APPLAUSE sign went up . Something was wrong . Frank 's heart began to go off like an alarm . <p> " So , indeed , we must ask again , as so many before us have stood and asked , not what our country can do for us , but do we really exist ? " <p> The sign . Laughter . Noise . She was ridiculing philosophy . But she wanted his approval . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now you have single-mindedly devoted yourself to the twin and noble causes  --  the pursuit of truth and your family 's poverty . " <p> Laughter . <p> He grinned widely , without humor . Maybe he was wrong . Maybe it was funny , this speech , mocking the language of the universities . Mocking his interest in philosophy . Maybe he was getting rigid , inflexible . Maybe he had gotten too used to being alone . <p> " To you , therefore , I say e pluribus unum , which means There 's one in every crowd . " <p> While they laughed good-naturedly , his eyes stung and he felt a chill pass through him like an electric shock . He closed his eyes . He tried to shut out the sharp sunshine , Sophie 's speech , the crowd of family and friends . In their place , he made himself remember the spare white apartment where he had spent the last year . The small kitchen with the refrigerator and stove at one end , the dark linoleum , the row of books lined up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter . <p> He could see himself , struggling across campus towards his small , white room through a snowstorm . That was him , the dark speck , trekking through the white cold . He felt as though he might not make it . There was already a blanket of deep snow , and he had to scoop a path . He could feel the aching muscles in his arms . He forced himself to bend and push in the shovel . He could feel his legs pushing desperately against the weight as he lifted the shovel . When he finally reached the low brick building , he leaned against the wall for a minute . Then he got out his key , staggered into the tiny room 's pure warmth , and shut the door . <p> <p> By Jeanne Murray Walker <p>
