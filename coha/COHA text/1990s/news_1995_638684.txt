<p> On Back-to-Basics , setting the record straight , <p> and the possible conversion of Wyco Elementary <p> As a Littleton teacher I wish to respond to The Post 's articles regarding the LPS Board of education election . First you quote candidate Mary McGlone , who mistakenly claims a " one-size-fits-all education " is advocated by the basics slate . Yet the pre-1993 board imposed similar graduation outcomes on all three , not two as reported , high schools . In truth the terms were being used to enact an educational plan desired by the district bureaucracy and similar to many other plans found throughout the nation . This plan threatened the academic freedom of students and teachers alike . <p> last year my personal evaluators , both of whom have left the district told me that if I insisted on teaching grammar in isolation , rather than as part of the literature lesson , I would be fired . <p> Finally , The Post has often written of the " brain drain " in LPS . But certainly , most of those who have left are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the community and who have had the good grace to seek districts that share their beliefs , leaving LPS to establish its new direction without them . <p> LINDA YOUNG <p> Denver <p> The Jefferson County Public School District ( R-1 ) was nationally renowned for excellence in education ; it is now mediocre . Average test scores for third-graders have just fallen below the national average . Notably these are the first children who have gone through four years of R-1 's Outcome Based Education teaching . Coincidence or consequence ? In either case the " outcome " is unacceptable ; R-1 is accountable , and the problem needs to be fixed . I urge Jeffco residents to dump the teacher 's union-supported incumbents and vote for the independent and real " back to basics " candidates : Tom Devenish and Milton Schuster . <p> PETER WAGNER <p> Golden <p> As a born-again Christian and advocate of the wisdom of the U.S. Constitution , as written , I qualify as a " conservative " in some quarters . As parent to five children ranging from a business school graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some thoughts about a supposedly " conservative " trend in this country that is best characterized by the words of the advocates of that trend : " Back To . " Those who wish to go " Back To " promote the notion that we were all better off at some mythical , previous time in history . In fact these folks take comfort in the predictable and controllable and will go to all lengtss to attain their notion of " good . " It seems that these " Back To 's " ( or B/T 's for short ) wish to save some of us from our misgudied notion that there may be more than one way that people learn . <p> Those with slightly less control orientation than the B/T 's usually find no problem allowing programs that cater to the B/T intellect and often welcome diversity for all . If we take a moment to regard Japan we will find a country of high test scores , high conformity , high teenage suicide rates and low creativity . A Japanese proverb states that " the nail that sticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which helped foster the Graduate Equivalent Degree for those leaving high school " too soon " now disallows people holding GEDs as recruits . While GEDs have as good an intellect as any other recruit , they are not good conformists and are less likely to follow orders . " The nail that sticks up must be hammered down . " <p> Please vote . Please vote your conscience . However , if you do n't believe that " the nail that sticks up must be hammered down , " please think long and hard before you vote for the " Back To 's . " <p> STEVEN J. BECKER <p> Lakewood <p> As a candidate for the Littleton Board of Education , I am compelled to respond to a letter that appeared in the Oct. 19 Post . In it Cindy Castellano takes liberties with the facts that can not go uncorrected . <p> She says , " Candidate Al Litwak last year described those who disagreed with his views as " Sandinistas who refuse to relinquish power . " Reminding wavering school board members about who their constituency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is not people like Sandinistas , who lost an election but refuse to relinquish power . " Ms. Castellano conveniently gutted the sentence to support her baseless contention . <p> As is quite evident , the comment was not a defense of my views . It was a reference to those who even today continue to deny the validity of the overwhelming electoral victory of the Back-to-Basics philosophy in Littleton 's 1993 school board election . Ms. Castellano must be able to see at least a faint parallel between what had been happening in Littleton and what happened when the Nicaraguan Sandinistas lost a democratic election but refused to relinquish their government posts . <p> Littleton now is engaged in a replay of the election campaign of 1993 , and opponents of the Back-to-Basics ' 95 slate are attempting to use tactics they employed in 1993 to discredit the slate . Because I am a member of that slate , and because Ms. Castellano has raised the issue , I want to let your readers know what my views are on the democratic process . They are these . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ballot and the fundamental good sense and decency of voters . I believe that the political process is the legitimate mechanism by which a democratic society decides what is to be done . I believe that when the ballots have been counted and the people have spoken , it is time to do what the electorate has indicated that it wants done . Those beliefs are shared by my fellow slate members , Cheryl Beabout and Kevin Loughrey . <p> That philosophy may be abhorrent to some . They may believe that popular elections have no place in the protocol of governing public schools , that running public schools should be the domain of a small cadre of activist parents and employees who know it all . I hope that the sensible voters of Littleton will again reject that elitist view and vote for the three Back-to-Basics ' 95 candidates , who are pledged to do what the voters will have elected them to do . <p> ALFRED LITWAK <p> Littleton <p> As a member of the School District 12 Facilities Planning Committee , I would like to respond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denver Post , regarding proposed changes to Wyco Elementary . I believe the article was inflammatory and misleading . The very first line asks the question " What would happen if your child 's elementary school closed ? " In fact , closing Wyco is the last thing that anybody involved is thinking about . I believe that if the Parents Against Wyco Conversion prevail , they will only guarantee Wyco 's ultimate failure . <p> A cruel irony facing District 12 is that , while it is considering building at least 2 new elementary schools to handle overcrowding on its north side , it is at the same time considering what to do with underutilized schools on its south side . As one example , Wyco has a building capacity ( not counting mobile classrooms ) of 440 students . For 1995 , its enrollment is about 350 students . It is expected to drop to 314 students over the next five years . Schools with so few students can not pay for computers , music , art , athletics and other programs that are part of a dynamic curriculum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must answer is this - should Wyco continue with a weak curriculum and an anemic enrollment , or should it become part of an innovative , win/win solution for the Wyco neighborhood and all of District 12 ? <p> The idea for a Northeast/Wyco Middle School Campus actually originated within Wyco Elementary . It helps to solve several problems that District 12 faces . It eases overcrowding at Northeast . It is millions of dollars cheaper than building a new middle school . It brings more students and new life to five dying elementary schools . <p> As much as I sympathize with the fears of some Wyco parents , the fact is that their children 's futures are better served by converting Wyco to become part of a dynamic Middle School campus . <p> JIM PILARSKI <p> Northglenn <p> Welfare cuts wean the administrators as well <p> Listening to the outcry surrounding proposed federal budget cuts one would believe these programs are actually intended to help people . They actually do help people ; just not those they profess to help . The beneficiaries of the programs are always the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet the biggest recipients of the welfare money are : Welfare Pimps . Yes , about 75 percent of the welfare budget never gets to the recipients . <p> Now the corker of all . Russell Means , the ex-leader of the American Indian Movement has seen the light . Means now says the federal cutbacks in the Bureau of Indian Affairs are " good because Indians receive only pennies from the BIA 's $ 173 billion annual budget.bc It 's going to hurt Indians somewhat , but what it 's gon na benefit is , we 're going to get rid of thousands of bureaucrats . " The Program Pimps . <p> LARRY DeCICCO <p> Evergreen <p> No DPS tax hike <p> A tax increase ? I do n't think so . There has to be a system involving genuine competition before a tax increase is justified . If parents could have at least one alternative , an increase probably would not be needed . Alternatives include a voucher system and contracting classroom teaching to independent contractors . Others include incentives for demonstrated competence by the teachers and goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system are mandated before increasing funding . <p> RODNEY J. PARKER <p> Denver
