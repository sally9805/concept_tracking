When the first Black family moved to Ferngreen , their white neighbors moved out in such haste that  --  it is said with great seriousness  --  some of them left without their furniture . Now , ten years later , the 27 red-brick cottages with severely mowed lawns and overarching oaks belong to Black families with modest jobs , savings accounts in credit unions and American cars in their garages . On Sundays their church trembles with the songs of parishioners who are so filled with the love of God , and so busy assailing heaven with volleys of praise and glory , that sometimes there is not enough love left for their neighbors . Miss Francesca Anderson the journalist  --  who has been 34 years old for the past three years  --  and Mr. Henry Lyle , the 40-year-old mechanic , used to attend that church every Sunday , but they were careful to sit as far away from each other as possible . Each sought to arrive just a little later than the other so that one could stare at the back of the other 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it left them exhausted , and the devil pleased but bewildered . Until her strategy was discovered , Miss Anderson would peep through her curtains until Mr. Lyle drove past , and she would follow when he had disappeared around the corner . After a month of having the back of his head seared by Miss Anderson 's stares , Mr. Lyle would park one block away from the church , then walk back quickly to crouch behind a hedge of red crepe myrtles and wait until the enemy entered . He noticed that she arrived exactly three minutes after him and so deduced her tactic . But in October the shrubs shed their leaves , and each protagonist was forced to wait for providence to offer an advantage . Such an enmity had not come suddenly or lightly . Once Mr. Lyle had loved the delicate and elegant Miss Anderson with a passion that had ruined his appetite , his sleep and three spark plugs . The sight of her in church and the smell of her cooking would drive him into paroxysms of emotion that caused him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creases in his pants so firmly ironed that the cloth shone like satin . He kept her appliances working better than new , made small repairs to her house before she noticed any damage , and once had treated her to a small soda and a minute hamburger at the nearby Dairy Queen . She had refused the foot-long hot dog and the double cheeseburger that he planned to order for himself . He had quivered in admiration at her restraint and ordered the same , but after driving her home , had returned to the restaurant for two foot-long hot dogs , a large vanilla milk shake and a small apple pie . One Christmas Eve , Mr. Lyle drove his heart 's desire to church . On the way back , lightheaded with the spirit of the season and submerged in a morass of nervous sweat , he asked her to marry him . Miss Anderson looked at her tall , gruff suitor , glanced at his grease-stained fingers , and with merciless certainty told him that the Good Lord had better things for her than marriage to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask what were the Lord 's plans for his beloved . Instead , his feelings for her instantly turned into a loathing as intense as his love had been . Occasionally small sorties in the Lyle-Anderson war took place in public , and the neighbors began to take sides . Most of the men sympathized with Mr. Lyle , but did so quietly because their wives had immediately and fiercely allied themselves with Miss Anderson . Of course the women were always gracious to Mr. Lyle and would have vigorously denied any antipathy toward him . The only neutral parties in the community were 17-year-old Francis Wilton , his diabetic friend , Cassandra Marshall , who had a proverbial appetite for sweets , and her unendingly tall brother , Lighthouse , whose similar weakness had rendered him almost toothless . Since the onset of hostilities , Miss Anderson had stopped being generous with her pastries and corn bread , and Mr. Lyle seldom had time to help the neighbors with minor car problems . One April an event took place in Ferngreen that should have brought the warring parties together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precision these acts of nature usually reserve for mobile-home parks . The neighboring communities were unscathed . Fortunately , only three houses were damaged by a fallen tree , and one of these was Miss Anderson 's . Even before she could assess the damage , the neighbors had assembled with axes and chain saws . No one worked harder than Mr. Lyle . He brushed past her without acknowledgement , and with a pruning saw and lopping shears set upon the branch that had spread its green embrace over her best furniture . Clumps of wood , leaves and twigs gushed in a green stream from the broken windows until only small fragments were left on the wet carpet . Forty minutes after he had entered the house , he left without a word . He would have walked past Miss Anderson without seeing her , but she stepped forward to block his path . " Mr. Lyle , " she said and paused , " thanks . Um ... how much do I owe you ? " For a few seconds Mr. Lyle stared uncomprehendingly at her , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swelled . Miss Anderson jumped back , convinced that the huge mechanic was about to lop and prune her head and limbs . " Christ ! " Mr. Lyle said , and strode off . At that moment some of Miss Anderson 's allies deserted her and became silent sympathizers with Mr. Lyle . Mr. Lyle 's allies raised their eyebrows and maintained a silence that almost roared . The nonpartisan Francis , Cassandra and Lighthouse revived memories of pastries that were good beyond praise and trembled in agony at their loss , as they sat in Cassandra 's living room to look at old copies of Jet magazine and to construct schemes , plots and stratagems to bring Miss Anderson and Mr. Lyle together . One night the conspirators were engaged in profound contemplations of human anatomy , as illustrated by the happy , smiling women in the magazines , when Cassandra pointed with disgust to a photograph of a singer dressed in little but a boa constrictor . " That 's nasty , " she said . " What 's she going to do if the snake starts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mincemeat , " Lighthouse said learnedly . Francis shook his head , " No , man , these snakes only eat rats . " " I do n't care . If I saw a thing like this in my house , you 'd hear me all around the I-285 . Man , I hate snakes , " Cassandra said , shivering . Francis jumped from his seat . " Hey ! I got it . I got it ! " he shouted . " Look , you know what we can do ? We can put a snake in Miss Anderson 's house and when she starts screaming , we can call Mr. Lyle to kill it . After that , they bound to make up . " " Where the hell you gon na get a snake and who the hell gon na put it in the house ? " Lighthouse asked reasonably . " I can get a grass snake in the woods back of the house , " Francis said . " You gon na catch a snake ? " Cassandra asked . " Well , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite , " Francis reassured her . " Do n't care , just do n't come by here with any snake , " she said . Lighthouse spoke up bravely , " Well , I 'll come with you , but you do the catching . " " And how you going to get the snake in the house ? " Cassandra asked . " On Saturday morning , Miss Anderson always opens the windows when she cleans the house . I can slip it in the kitchen window , " Francis said . The discussion continued for about an hour and ended with two voting for and one against the scheme . The dissenter promised not to betray the others , and on a Saturday morning , a small , bemused grass snake found itself in a strange new environment and promptly secreted itself in a cupboard under the sink , where it pondered on what the future held for it in its new situation . Sometimes we recoil when a stranger reaches out to help as we stumble , and sometimes we retort to a kind word with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Anderson : She considered all the people on her street as her extended family ; she had not meant to hurt Mr. Lyle when he had proposed , but she had been too surprised to refuse him politely , and she had responded too quickly . Then she had become angry at Mr. Lyle because of her confusion and his own anger . Miss Anderson was a Strelling University woman , and she expected to marry a Masefield man . " You do n't marry no man without a degree , " her grandmother reminded her constantly . Mother Constance Anderson had invested $2,000 in her granddaughter 's education and so was entitled to make the most important decisions for her . But the Masefield men whom Miss Anderson had seen during the last ten years had enjoyed her cooking and generosity and had moved on . Still , she would not entertain the prospect of marrying a mechanic . But her quarrel with Mr. Lyle was not right , and she wanted it to end . These were her thoughts on a Sunday morning as she sat in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poodle 's ears . Then she saw the snake crawl out of the partly opened door of the cupboard under the sink . Her scream was probably the loudest sound ever heard in Ferngreen . Francis heard and recognized it . He was out of the house and running toward Miss Anderson 's house to confirm the cause of the noise before his parents were aware of the disturbance . Miss Anderson was in her yard , dressed in a thin housecoat , jumping around screaming , " Snake ! Snake ! " Francis rushed to Mr. Lyle 's house . Mr. Lyle was in his garage , dressed in a pair of shorts and a greasy T-shirt . " What 's going on over there ? Who 's screaming ? " he asked Francis . " Snake in Miss Anderson 's house ! " Francis gasped . Mr. Lyle grabbed a massive crowbar from the garage and ran to save the woman he hated . When they arrived at Miss Anderson 's house , a small crowd of brave rescuers had gathered in the street at a safe distance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included a tire iron , a spray can of insecticide , two shot-guns , a walking stick , three bricks and one umbrella . Mr. Lyle pushed through the crowd . The sight of Miss Anderson in the translucent gown set his blood to boiling ; he would cheerfully have faced angry Brazilian anacondas for her at that moment . " Where 's the snake ? " he asked . " In the kitchen , " Miss Anderson answered . Mr. Lyle rushed inside , and the dog immediately attacked him . He rushed back outside . " Somebody get that dog ! " he shouted . Miss Anderson called to her poodle and grabbed him as he came out the door . Mr. Lyle went back into the kitchen . He looked carefully around the floor and under the chairs and table . There was no snake . Then he went down on all fours and even more carefully began checking the cupboards under the counter . While he was looking under the sink , the poodle escaped and ran back into the house . It went into the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unsure of what to do about the unusual presentation , it went up quietly to investigate . Mr. Lyle was suddenly aware of a cold object nosing around his shorts . He cried out and reared back , thinking it was the snake , and crashed his head against the top of the cupboard , knocking himself out . The poodle became frantic . The crowd heard the noise and sent a small posse to investigate . They saw Mr. Lyle sprawled on the floor and immediately surmised that he had been bitten by the snake . Someone quickly called 911 . In five minutes , a police car roared up , followed by an ambulance . Two policemen with guns drawn entered first , followed by two very worried paramedics with a stretcher . They found Mr. Lyle sitting on the floor rubbing his head . " Where 're you bitten , sir ? " one paramedic asked . " No , I knocked my head against the counter , " Mr. Lyle said . " Well , I think we 'd better take you to Emergency anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stretcher , and the paramedics were on their way out when the grass snake decided to check on the commotion outside its new home . It crawled out of a cupboard near the door , near the foot of one of the policemen , who shouted , " Snake ! " The paramedics looked down , glimpsed the little creature and burst out of the house . The handle of the stretcher caught against the doorjamb , and Mr. Lyle was thrown out into the yard . The policemen were unable to fire at the snake for fear of killing each other in the small space . The grass snake concluded that all was not well in the new place and headed for the bright light of the doorway . It perceived the milling crowd at one end of the garden and immediately headed for a thorn hedge at the other , resolving not to stop moving for the next hour . Henceforth it would avoid all contact with its human neighbors . Mr. Lyle suffered a bruised elbow and a severely sprained ankle . Later that evening , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandaged leg resting on a footstool , Miss Anderson knocked and walked in . " Brought you some chicken-and-dumpling soup . And some pastries , " she said . Mr. Lyle smiled hesitantly , not sure of an appropriate reaction . " That 's very nice . Thank you . You 'll sit down for a minute ? " " Okay , " Miss Anderson said . Two hours later she rose to leave . " Um ... " Mr. Lyle said hesitantly , then blurted , " why do n't you stay ? " " The night ? " Miss Anderson asked in surprise . Mr. Lyle nodded , too scared to speak . Miss Anderson thought for a moment , then said , " How about tomorrow night ? " Mr. Lyle smiled in disbelief . He would have been happy if she had said next year . Miss Anderson bent down and kissed him lightly on the mouth . " Good night , Henry , " she said . " Good night , Francesca , " he answered .
