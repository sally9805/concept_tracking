THIS TIME , IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DIFFERENT . <P> White House officials gave Bill Clinton , a chronic procrastinator , a full six weeks to get ready for his State of the Union speech . Tired of those harrowing last-minute cut-and-paste sessions that have marked nearly all his major addresses , Clinton 's aides met with the President before Christmas to discuss a couple of broad themes for the occasion , " renewal " and " continuity . " Three weeks later , they delivered a first draft in a fax to Clinton in Europe . With a week to go , speechwriters David Dreyer and Bob Boorstin met with Clinton on Air Force One to rework weak spots . The new discipline seemed to be working . " This will be a shorter , more focused speech , " an official boasted . <P> But change , as Clinton says , is never easy . He managed only to whittle his speech down to what an Administration wag called a " tight 64 minutes "  --  half again as long as most recent State of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1994 to seven initiatives , eight if you count the information superhighway , but could n't resist adding a dozen or so secondary and tertiary items , amounting to an enormously ambitious and detailed to-do list by any standard . The carefully planned practice sessions were postponed until Tuesday , and then nearly backfired : the price of the hurried run- throughs was the early onset of laryngitis . " Damn it , " Clinton said , practicing at his kitchen table Tuesday afternoon , " I know I 'm going to lose my voice . " Clinton made it through the speech , but just barely , his voice catching on every fricative by the end . The next day his voice was gone . <P> The hour-long speech was an apt symbol of Clinton 's presidency after one year : a bold , ungainly , often messy affair that moves in many directions , is impervious to order and yet , by sheer dint of effort , may prove successful . Recent polls have shown that Americans  --  whatever they think of his policies and his character  --  appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton knows these traits are his biggest advantages . As he told a senior Republican lawmaker last fall , " I 'm a lot like Baby Huey . I 'm fat . I 'm ugly . But if you push me down , I keep coming back . I just keep coming back . " <P> Clinton 's knack for self-renewal was evident again last week . As the economy showed signs of steady improvement , he was remaking his political goals to fit the electorate 's less anxious mood . He all but boasted that nearly every detail of his controversial health-care reform proposal was negotiable , including its all-important implementation timetable . And he reached deep into enemy territory , stealing Republican rhetoric on crime , defense cuts and values to appeal to independent voters who have been slowest to find their " comfort level " with Clinton . The centrist language  --  " We ca n't renew our country until we realize that governments do n't raise children ; parents do "  --  had Perot voters and " weak " Clinton supporters assembled in Dayton Tuesday night by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he talked about crime , " said a Clinton adviser , " the dial groups loved it .
