<p> NEW YORK  --  ITT CEO Rand Araskog was preparing for a business trip to Paris last January when a fax machine in a dark corner of his Park Avenue apartment spit out news of Hilton 's hostile offer . <p> Wow , $ 85 a share , we 'll have to consider this , Araskog remembers thinking . <p> But later he learned he had misread the fax in the shadows . Hilton was offering only $ 55 a share . <p> " It could have all been so different , " Araskog joked Wednesday before a packed ballroom in the posh St. Regis Hotel at ITT 's annual meeting . After all , he had just spent months snubbing Hilton in one of the nastiest corporate showdowns since the down-and-dirty battles of the 1980s . <p> For ITT , the vote was a Pyrrhic victory , because the 77-year-old former conglomerate that once produced everything from Wonder Bread to telephones will cease to exist . It will be sold to real estate investment trust Starwood Lodging Trust for $ 10.2 billion . <p> And for Araskog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , Wednesday was full of mixed emotions . While victorious after being criticized for turning his back on shareholders , Araskog can boast of increasing ITT 's stock value by more than 80% since January . But by selling ITT , Araskog , 66 , will give up his job and watch his company be absorbed . <p> Araskog has reflected before on the cost of takeovers . " All too often , companies subject to a takeover are disrupted , dismembered , downsized and hollowed out , " he wrote in his 1989 book , The ITT Wars , an account of his successful defense against corporate raiders in the 1980s . <p> And with ITT shareholders voting Wednesday to re-elect the current board , prompting Hilton to drop its bid , Araskog can relish yet another successful defense . <p> For Hilton CEO Stephen Bollenbach , who sat slumped in a chair only a few feet away from Araskog at the meeting , the vote seemed to be a final confirmation that his strategy  --  trying to buy ITT on the cheap  --  had badly misfired . Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disney , Bollenbach seemed a day late and a dollar short throughout this contest . <p> " I am disappointed in that this would have been a tremendous deal and combination for shareholders , but I have no personal emotions about it , " Bollenbach said . " It 's not as bad as when I stub my toe in the backyard . " <p> Bollenbach , 55 , looking fatigued , said later he does n't think Araskog was prepared to sell at any price . So it would n't have mattered if that first bid had been $ 85 a share . Araskog said Wednesday he would have talked to Hilton from the start if it had offered $ 75 a share . <p> More than 65 million shares were voted in favor of re-electing ITT 's board vs. 25 million shares for Hilton 's slate , according to preliminary results . Final certified results will be available in about a week . <p> But Bollenbach apparently knew Tuesday night he had lost based on the early tallies . Votes Tuesday night were 57 million shares for ITT , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bollenbach attended the meeting accompanied by an entourage of fellow executives , investment bankers and Hilton 's board candidates , including former New Jersey Gov . Tom Florio . Midway into the meeting , Bollenbach presented a brief pitch for Hilton 's slate and buyout proposal . But it was delivered in a flat tone without passion . <p> Big shareholders ' support <p> The key to ITT winning the vote was the support of some major institutional investors . Fidelity Management , ITT 's largest shareholder , split its voting rights among differing portfolio managers  - -  12 million shares for ITT and 4 million for Hilton . Alliance Capital , the second-largest shareholder , voted all of its rights on 5.7 million shares for ITT . Both firms declined comment Wednesday . <p> ITT says it also garnered strong support from retail investors and , surprisingly , from arbitrageurs , speculators on takeover stocks that seemed to be favoring the higher cash component of Hilton 's offer . <p> Much to ITT 's astonishment , Bankers Trust , the trustee for the 401 ( k ) retirement plans at ITT and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted 5 million shares for Hilton . Bankers Trust also is financing Starwood 's bid . <p> Some shareholders who voted for Hilton say they were surprised by the margin of difference in votes . " We were a bit shocked , but in retrospect , we 're just glad it got to a shareholders ' vote , " said Brad Pacheco , a spokesman for California Public Employees Retirement System , the mammoth pension fund . Calpers voted its 750,000 shares for Hilton . " How we voted is a moot point now . Going forward , we 'll be looking at all the issues . " <p> And those issues certainly will involve Starwood Lodging Trust buying ITT . Starwood CEO Barry Sternlicht , who for weeks has had to defend the unusual tax structure of his real estate investment trust , said after the vote that the combination of ITT and Starwood is " a chance to change the paradigm in the hotel industry . " He said the new company could be " potentially lethal . " <p> Starwood is buying Westin Hotels , another upscale chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotels in 70 countries . The ITT deal caps a bold expansion over the past few years that has made Phoenix-based Starwood the USA 's largest real estate investment trust and a stock market highflier . <p> Untested in the casino business though , Sternlicht said he will give himself 18 months to assess whether he would want to sell ITT 's casinos after the deal 's anticipated close in late January . <p> Would he consider selling casinos to Hilton ? <p> " I 'm willing to look at anything that enhances shareholder value , " said Sternlicht , 36 . He added Starwood probably would sell ITT 's international telephone directory business and a chain of technical schools . <p> Earlier at the meeting , after the vote was announced , shareholders and colleagues shook Sternlicht 's hand and slapped him on the back . He told them he felt vindicated after his relatively unknown company was scrutinized so heavily for weeks . <p> The 90-minute annual meeting , delayed from its usual date in May , was so crowded that closed-circuit televisions had to be set up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handshake <p> The main ballroom was a sea of gray business suits . Cellular phones could occasionally be heard ringing . Ushers cruised up and down the aisles taking last-minute proxies being voted . In addition to a presentation from Sternlicht , the usual array of annual meeting gadflies made run-on speeches . <p> Bollenbach shook Araskog 's hand at the end of the meeting and apologized for some of the remarks he made the past nine months , including calling him a " weenie . " Araskog accepted the apology . <p> Bollenbach , who was recruited by Hilton to boost the company 's lackluster stock , said afterward that Hilton would n't try to buy another brand-name chain , but would look at buying individual hotels and casinos to build its business . He said Hilton 's profit on the more than 300,000 ITT shares it owns  --  more than $ 12 million  --  will help offset the cost of its failed takeover attempt . <p> Asked whether he might leave Hilton , Bollenbach says he plans to retire at 65 from Hilton . <p> If Bollenbach looked crushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it was a " bittersweet " day for him , knowing he 'll only be CEO of ITT for several more weeks . " I 've enjoyed my job and been criticized for enjoying it too much , " said Araskog , who was once labeled a poster boy for excessive executive pay . He was criticized for his $ 11.4 million pay package in 1990 . <p> Araskog , visibly upset in a news conference after the vote , talked about how he had been maligned as a manager . He said Hilton 's pursuit did n't allow him to realize his long-term vision for ITT , forcing him to prematurely sell several businesses and abandon the company 's sports-entertainment ventures , including Madison Square Garden . <p> " I was always looking at the year 2001 , " Araskog said . " We needed the time and we did not get it . " <p> As for Araskog 's future ? " I do n't know what I will be doing now , but I can guarantee you , I am going to have fun doing it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hilton Hotel 's nine-month battle for ITT reached a climax Wednesday when ITT shareholders re-elected ITT 's board , spurning Hilton 's offer . <p> The white knight <p> Barry Sternlicht <p> CEO of Starwood Lodging Trust <p> The guardian <p> Rand Araskog <p> CEO of ITT Sheraton <p> The attacker <p> Stephen Bollenbach <p> CEO of Hilton Hotels <p> Act I <p> Jan 27 : Hilton launches unsolicited cash and stock bid of $ 55 a share for ITT . <p> Act II <p> Aug. 6 : Hilton raises its cash and stock bid to $ 70 a share . <p> Act III <p> Oct. 20 : ITT agrees to sell itself to Starwood for $ 82 a share in cash and stock . <p> Act IV <p> Nov. 3-7 : Hilton raises bid to $ 80 a share . Starwood raises offer to $ 85 a share four days later .
