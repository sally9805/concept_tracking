Chapter One : The Drawing Beverly adjusted the jalousie on the living room window in order to view Carl . Among his blond strands stood some conspicuous grays . The gray hairs were coarser , sturdier than the blond wisps that had carried him through his fifty years . He swept his callused hand through his locks and settled into his wicker chair . " Carl , do you want something to drink ? " Carl waited for Beverly to come to the porch door , then shook his head . Beverly , dressed only in her underwear , walked out onto the porch and sat at his feet . The cold wooden planks touched her thighs and caused her shoulders to shiver . " Night 's creeping up on us , " she said . " I 've got to go home . " " Stay , Carl , please . I 'll make bouillabaisse and fresh garlic bread . " Carl shook his head . She knew he could see the river peeking out from behind the trees . His rowboat would be by the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would be home before dark . He rubbed his hands together , then stretched his arms out wide . As he brought his hands down to his knees to rise , Beverly grabbed one hand . " Do you love me ? " she asked . He looked at her without expression . With his free hand he reached into the pocket of his white trousers and pulled out a piece of paper . It was folded into a small square . Uninvited , she took the paper from his hand and unfolded it . There was her body , sketched out in pencil : her long legs , the slightly domed tummy with the pubic hair rising almost to her navel , the funnel-like breasts peaking in dark swirls , and the slender nape reaching up behind the earlobes . But it was the perfection of the facial features that gave her the confidence to smile up at him . He stood . " Tomorrow ? " she asked . Carl shrugged and moved down the steps to the gravel path . She waved , but he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some Mahler , she thought , finish the Nietzsche book that they had discussed earlier that day , and have a light supper . Most of the next day Beverly pecked at letters on her computer keyboard , forming words that ran into sentences . The drawing lay to the right of the keyboard . She was sorry she had n't asked him to sign it , " Love , Carl . " Maybe tonight . Beverly had dinner late that night . She did n't know whether to make it for one or two . Eventually she put single portions on the stove . At bedtime she plumped up some pillows along his side of the bed and threw her left leg across the bottom pillow . The pillow was still buried between her thighs when she felt a hand slide up her buttocks . She looked at the clock . Seven a.m . The hand felt rough against her . It coursed over her flesh like sandpaper levelling a rough board . His full lips touched her shoulder blades . Then she felt the hair of his chest rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreading across the pillowcase as her pelvis pushed into it . ******* Later , at breakfast , she noticed how dark Carl 's skin was , as if he had been working outdoors all the previous day . His blond hair had been whitened by the sun , almost camouflaging the grays . His hands were raw . Many calluses had broken open into wounds . " You must have worked hard yesterday . " He did n't say anything . " By the way , I 'd like you to sign the drawing . " He looked at her and shook his head . His handsome features were pensive . She saw a cruelty that had never been there before . " Why not ? " " I should n't have given it to you . I should have kept it for myself . " She smiled . " I 'm sure you can duplicate it . " She started to remove her bathrobe . " I 'll even pose for it . " Beverly dropped the robe over the back of her chair and stood . " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage a repeat performance . " A few hours later , there were a blank paper and a pencil on the nightstand . On the bed Carl and Beverly lay entwined . She was awakened by the jolting movement of his body . Carl was trying to reach for the drawing material . Beverly moaned . Carl gave up his attempt and instead lay still beneath her . His breath halted a second or two and then slowly gained its rhythm . She waited . Ten minutes , a half hour , a day later , she did n't know which , then she suckled his teat . Beverly spread her legs across his hips and sat atop his body ; she smiled , satisfied but hungry . He picked up the pencil and paper . Immediately she stood up on the mattress and heaved her auburn hair up across her forearms . He sketched . The drawing was not as perfect as the first . His hand was shaky , and the lines were not following her body contours . This seemed to anger him . " I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got up to prepare lunch . As she left the bedroom , she turned to look at Carl . His hands obviously ached , for he grimaced as he opened and closed his fists . He stopped only to shred the paper and let the bits fall onto the stained sheet . Beverly retrieved her robe in the kitchen and prepared an elaborate lunch . After setting the table , she found Carl dressed and in her office playing with the computer keyboard . " You 've got to turn it on if you want to produce anything . " She giggled from the doorway . She saw Carl glance at the drawing that she had left next to the keyboard . Every curve , every shading was in place . " Come on , Carl . Lunch is on the table . " She was already seated when Carl entered the dining room . " Slowpoke , " she teased . At the table Beverly kept staring at his hands . " How do you get those things ? " she asked , a forkful of pasta poised in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and callused hands . " I bury things . " " Bulbs ? " " What ? " " What do you bury ? Are you planting a garden ? God , it 's been , what , eight months since I 've been at your place . Remember ? It was the day I signed the lease for this house . " Carl nodded . " Can you imagine ? We 've been neighbors now for eight months and lovers for seven of them . " Carl smiled at her . " And it 's been days since you smiled at me like that . " " I 'm sorry , Beverly . I 'm under some stress right now . " " Is that why you 've been working so hard in the yard ? " He laughed . " As a matter of fact , that 's exactly why I 've been digging . " " You want to talk about it ? " " No ! " Beverly looked down at her plate and realized she could n't finish the pasta . " You 're a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . He squeezed them tightly . " I have to go . " " Please , Carl . You never wanted to leave in the past . You would spend as long as a week with me and go home reluctantly to check on your place . Now I ca n't get you to spend a single day with me . Why ? " His eyes seemed to shimmer under salty tears that never fell . As he got up , she watched his linen suit fall in wrinkles around his robust body . He still had the body of his youth , and Beverly assumed it was due to his penchant for digging . She watched him walk to the threshold of the dining room and stop . His hands reached up and grasped the lintel . He hesitated . Beverly rushed from her seat and threw her arms around him . She could smell his body through the cloth , rich and heady , stifling her breath . " I love you , Beverly , but ... " She waited for the " I ca n't make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to his right trousers pocket , almost slid his hand in , but stopped . Instead , he patted the pocket and pulled away from her . Beverly watched him walk down the gravel path until he was hidden by the fir trees . When she brought her hands up to her face to rub away the tension , she smelled the garlic embedded in her fingertips and remembered that she had to clean the dining room after the half-eaten lunch . After completing innumerable petty chores , she decided to hunker down to write . As she entered the office , she noticed that the drawing was missing . She searched the floor around the computer table , hoping that it had fallen . It was not there . Beverly sat on the hardwood floor and felt hot tears streaming down her cheeks . That night , in bed , Beverly lay naked upon her cotton sheet , the tan of her body emphasized by the white of the material . Her dark eyes penetrated the dimness of the moon-sprayed room . The ceiling fan whooshed the air above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for comfort as she closed her eyes . Whoosh ... whoosh . It became a lullaby amid the hyacinth smell of night . Beverly 's limbs softened on the verge of sleep , when suddenly her breath halted , and she found herself panting for air as her head turned toward the open French doors leading to the garden . She swallowed and choked , then with her hands she pushed her body up off the bed , scrambling to the floor . Finally , she was able to stand and move to the garden . The summer heat , cooled by the moon 's full glow , hugged her body . Her breasts , stimulated by the night chill , ached as she sucked in deep breaths of air . A dream , she said to herself as her breath started to come again . A dream , a nightmare , she thought . But sleep never came that night , and it seemed that over the next few days she dozed lightly only at the keyboard or while reading on the garden swing . Deep , dreamy , reviving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her shower Beverly stood in front of the full-length mirror that hung behind the door to her bedroom . She had been skipping meals , and when she did sit to eat she barely touched her food . However , her body seemed to be swelling . There was a gnawing inside her gut , a steady nibbling at her intestines . As she belched , she tried to push on her stomach . Then she noticed the nail on her right index finger was loose -- not just a portion of it , but the entire nail was coming free of its bed . She swung the bedroom door open and rushed to the bathroom for a bandage . " Shit , " she complained and wound the strip tightly around the finger . When she looked in the mirror , she saw two reddish , bloated cheeks beneath the dark semicircles that sagged under her big eyes . She had been pondering the possibility of an allergy or asthma , but these new symptoms frightened her . Could her ailment be more severe ? If Carl did not come today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had no telephone and no road led to his house , but she knew if she just kept walking upstream along the water 's edge she would reach his place . But she did n't have to , because at midday , as the sun was peaking , he arrived . He looked refreshed and even smiled when he saw her . Beverly moved awkwardly toward him as he entered her house . Her body felt full ; her skin was pigmented with splotches of dusky red tint . A stale , eggish odor emanated from the folds of her flesh . " Oh , Carl , I need you . " Carl held her and swept his long fingers through her thinning hair . " I do n't know what 's happening to me . It started the day you left . I 've had trouble breathing and  --  " Carl pressed his lips to her mouth and thanked her . " What for ? " she asked , moving her head back slightly so she could see him . " For what you 're doing . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back through the hallway to her bedroom and sat her on the bed . He knelt before her and undid the buttons on the front of her dress . His hands caressed her shrunken breasts and his tongue circled the hardened tips . Beverly was embarrassed , amazed , and soothed . Carl pulled the dress completely open and let his lips slide down to kiss her distended stomach as if she were pregnant from his seed . " Do you know what 's wrong with me ? " she asked . He nodded . " You 've taken my place in the grave , Beverly . " " What are you talking about ? " Her voice was louder than she meant it to be . " I 'm so afraid of dying , Beverly . I 'm afraid of the brown earth encasing me , swallowing me . Several years ago , when I found out that I was terminally ill , I travelled the Amazon , where I learned a trick , a means to stay alive , from a small tribe that lived in the dense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carve out an exact replica of someone in an enemy village . Then he personally would bury the reproduction deep in the soil . The deeper he buried it , the longer the spell would last . At times , it 's lasted as long as fifteen months for me . " " My God ! What are you talking about ? " " The drawing , Beverly . I buried it after I left here last time  --  I had to do it . I could feel the maggots starting to eat away at my innards . I would have bloated like you and  --  " Beverly screamed and grabbed her stomach with her hands . Her shoulders hunched upward as her body tilted forward to release a hoarse cry . Carl held her tight and kissed the auburn hair already lying rootless on top of her head . " I love you , Beverly . That 's why I almost gave you the drawing . But it was too late for me to find someone else . Neurological control had dissipated in my hands to the point that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be created by my hands . A photograph would n't do . The original drawing was made when we first slept together . Then I did n't mind the idea of using you , but later it preyed on my conscience . I thought of how I would miss you  --  but this is the greatest act of love you could give me , and I realize you 've always been braver than I. Probably loved me more , too . " " Carl , stop it . Why are you telling me this stupid story ? " " Because I thought that if you knew the truth you 'd allow me to help . I can make your passing gentler . " " Passing ? Are you saying I 'm dying ? " " Oh , no , Beverly . You are dead . Now the decay starts . " " I do n't believe you . How could you make light of my illness ? " " Beverly , you are beyond illness . Look at your hands . " She spread her fingers in front of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb . Was it a bruise ? she wondered . Her touch did not cause pain , but the skin began to scale . And what of the roil inside her body ? Her hands returned to her stomach . " What about me , Carl ? What about my life ? " " I 'll always think of you , Beverly . When the time comes to take your remains down to the river , I promise to pray for you . I built an elaborate casket for your image . It 's sturdy ; should hold up for quite some time . It 'll make the decay take place more slowly . Give you time to settle any matters you think are important . " " What if I go to the police ? " " And say what ? " Beverly swung her body down across the mattress and rolled over onto her right side while still clutching the churning life in her stomach . " I lined the casket with the best white satin I could obtain and smoothed the drawing across the bottom among some rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image , and I sang a hymn as I lowered the coffin into the grave . It was a moving ceremony , really . This is the first time I 've ever buried someone I loved . " Beverly was screaming . Was it inside her head or coming up through her body ? She was too confused to know for sure . Carl rolled her over onto her back , and she felt him trying to enter her . Her hands beat against his head . She pounded and kicked to release herself from this bringer of death . From far away she heard him say that he was leaving ; he could n't stand to see her like this . " You did it ! You did it ! " she yelled and watched him walk out of the room . She slid off the bed and stumbled into her office . Alone in the house now , she sat at her desk , remembering every detail of Carl 's face and form . She tried to duplicate him on paper but failed . If onlyher hands could mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the pronounced cheekbones , the straight , slender nose ... What the hell am I doing believing this crap ? She flung the paper and pencil on the floor . She needed medical help , not ridiculous voodoo . She wrung her hands together , and as she did sheaths of skin dropped onto the desk blotter . Her howling reached as far as Carl , who was about to push his boat into the river .
