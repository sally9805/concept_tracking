During the Carter Administration , potter and arts advocate Joan Mondale , the wife of then-Vice President Walter Mondale , turned their official residence in Washington , DC , into a showcase for the work of American craftspeople . Now President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton , who are said to have a personal interest in craft , have given it an even bigger stage  --  at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue . It all started with the Clintons ' wish to celebrate their first White House Christmas  --  and 1993 as the proclaimed Year of American Craft  --  by decking the halls with handmade holiday adornments . With help from Michael Monroe , curator-in-charge of the Smithsonian Institution 's Renwick Gallery of the National Museum of American Art , President and Mrs. Clinton last summer invited 3,000 artists to create ornaments for the White House Christmas tree . The response was overwhelming : 7,500 objects were contributed ( many , at the First Lady suggestion , depicting angels ) . Going further , and again assisted by Monroe , the Clintons invited each of 70 artists  --  both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or her work toward the establishment of a permanent White House collection of contemporary craft . The unveiling took place December 9 at a reception hosted by the Clintons and attended by many of the artists . There were enough ornaments to decorate a number of trees around the residence , as well as the official 18-foot-tall Fraser fit in the Blue Room , which featured a skirt of 57 fabric pieces by makers from every state , territory and possession . the 70 works in the newly formed collection  --  in clay , glass , metal , fiber and wood  --  were exhibited atop mantles , tables , consoles and cabinets throughout the public areas of the White House , all to superb effect , reports Monroe , who oversaw their placement together with Mrs. Clinton 's social secretary , Ann Stock . " We 'd been concerned because this was a very historical building with lots of period furniture . But it was wonderful to see how well everything worked together , " Monroe says of the installation . " There is a linkage . All crafts join traditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will be displayed on special occasions , such as a recent dinner for the nation 's governors where selected objects served as centerpieces . <p>
