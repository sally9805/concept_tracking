YEP , I 'M GAY <P> " I 'm not sure America is ready for her , but I can only cast my vote in favor of Ellen DeGeneres for having the courage to be honest . " KRISTINA BURKE Highlands Ranch , Colorado <P> Hooray for Ellen DeGeneres ! It is hard being gay , and it is especially hard to admit publicly that you are TELEVISION , April 14 . Ellen 's coming out will help everyone else see that gays are not freaks but are normal and sometimes even famous . No one chooses to be gay ; we are born that way . But even in today 's world , there are folks who are still closed-minded . A lot of us work hard to hide our sexuality for fear of being outcast , harassed or fired . Ellen has helped us take a step in the right direction . NAME WITHHELD ON REQUEST Beaufort , South Carolina <P> Your report was an affront to decency in general and the troubled family unit in particular . Amid a world in chaos , as America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softens , you place on your cover a glorification of unnatural sexual behavior . Shame on you , TIME ! JACK E. SHULER Londonderry , New Hampshire <P> Your cover article was terrific ! Not only was it presented with class , but it also provided an overview of TV firsts that was informative and eye-opening . DeGeneres should be applauded for her courage . Those of us who know the struggle of discovering our sexuality  --  especially that feeling of not fitting in  --  and our individuality are deeply indebted not only to DeGeneres but also to all the other actors who have braved uncharted waters so that the rest of us can understand and be understood . TAMMY K. ALVOID Gahanna , Ohio <P> Frankly , my dear , I do n't give a damn . JEAN ROBERT Quebec City , Canada <P> As a conservative Roman Catholic , I had a preconceived idea about how I would react to your report on DeGeneres and others who live a gay life-style . However , my reading of the superbly objective article , coupled with the knowledge that God showers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that obligations are placed on us to offer more love to all God 's creations and try to understand the uniqueness God intended . HENRY T. DOHERTY Miami <P> I find it very disturbing when homosexuality is portrayed as a normal , alternative life-style . TV quite often glamorizes what happens in real life . Someone needs to take a stand on moral values . MARGARET WIEBE Winnipeg , Manitoba <P> DeGeneres may not want to represent the gay community , but she does represent its promise . Maybe now Americans will begin to realize we are not all a bunch of freaks . Thanks , Ellen , for being brave and putting yourself on the line . KEITH ANYON Santa Monica , California <P> Ellen , relax . It 's the type of person you are that counts . RON CARMEAN Philadelphia <P> It is none of my business if DeGeneres is gay , and I do n't like her trying to make it my business . DeGeneres , keep your private life private or get help . JAMES R. STAHL Findlay , Ohio <P> The more visible gay and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will face . It is my dream that one day coming out as a gay person will not be cover-story news .
