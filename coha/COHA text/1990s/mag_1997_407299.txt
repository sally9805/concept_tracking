Needle Points BY JUNE ROGERS Like the feathery seeds of a milkweed plant on a windy day , microscopic viruses and bacteria are propelled into the air by a cough , a sneeze , and softly land on a hand , a toy , a cup . With the germs now on her hands , a baby need only rub her tired eyes or scratch her itchy nose to unwittingly infect herself . In the case of a garden - variety cold virus , she may have the sniffles for a few days , but eventually her immune system will throw off the invader . In the case of the more serious infectious childhood diseases such as polio , pertussis , measles , mumps and rubella , the consequences can be much more grave . That is why , since the late 1800s , medical scientists all over the world have been formulating vaccines to try to eliminate as many diseases as possible , but especially those that would maim or kill our children . Immunologists begin with the premise that when the body 's immune system fights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antibodies against that disease to ward off a second attack . Vaccines work in the same way . By isolating a less virulent form of a live virus , or by killing it , and then injecting the substance into the body , the immune system responds in the same manner , but without the disease 's serious side effects . The body , therefore , has a defence system already in place when the real threat arises . Many vaccination campaigns have been effective in reducing the number of people who contract certain diseases ; others have succeeded even further . According to the World Health Organization , smallpox has been eradicated , and polio has been eliminated in the Americas . In an effort to do the same with measles , many countries have implemented a two - dose immunization program . In some cases , such as in the Caribbean , they 've actually eradicated measles . And just last year , most Canadian territories and provinces began their catch - up campaigns . The reason for the second dose is that the first one was only 95 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining five percent of non - immune children would fuel a measles epidemic across the country . They noted that , in 1993 , only 203 cases were reported nationwide . In 1995 , the number jumped to over 2,300 . ( In contrast , before the vaccine was introduced in 1963 , 20,000 - 80,000 cases of measles were reported every year . Measles can lead to complications , including ear infection , pneumonia and , more rarely , encephalitis , an inflammation of the brain , and death . ) Says Philippe Duclos , chief of the division of immunization at Health Canada 's Laboratory Centre for Disease Control : " Canada had 50 percent of all reported cases of measles in all of the Americas last year 1995 . We were the only developed country that had not started a catch - up campaign . " Adds Ontario 's Chief Medical Officer of Health , Dr. Richard Schabas : " The measles vaccine is an outstanding vaccine . But we were seduced into believing that no booster was needed because we thought it was more effective than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised concerns with some parents , adding more fuel to the ongoing debate about the safety of vaccinations in general . Questions about immunization started increasing in the 1970s , when groups sprang up in the United States , Britain and Australia in reaction to reports that children were being harmed by vaccinations , especially the one for pertussis ( or whooping cough ) . Edda West , spokesperson for the Toronto - based parents ' organization formerly called Vaccination Risk Information and Alternatives Resource Group ( Variance ) , says that she was inundated with calls after the measles campaign began in Ontario in January 1996 . " I spoke to hundreds of people who said that they had not received enough information about the risks of the measles vaccine , " says West . Most parents wondered why , if only five percent are susceptible , all two million Ontario school - aged children have to be revaccinated . Dr. Schabas explains that it would not have been very cost - efficient to have ordered blood tests on all those children to find out if they were immune . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine cost 85 cents . He also says that the only serious risk of measles revaccination is a severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis , which occurs in less than one in a million cases . Public health nurses administering vaccinations are trained to deal with this condition on the spot . Children who are allergic to eggs ( the virus is incubated in chicken embryos ) or the antibiotic neomycin , the vaccine 's preservative , should be exempted . Still , Edda West can relate to those concerned callers ' unease . In 1977 her third and youngest child , Keri , had a bad experience after the measles , mumps and rubella ( MMR ) vaccine when she was 15 months old . After the injection , Keri developed a 40degreeC fever for five days or so before a measles - like rash appeared . " I was an experienced mom and I had never seen a child so sick , " she attests . Even years before , when her two older children got measles , she says , they were n't that ill . West maintains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine and was frustrated when the doctor refused to believe that Keri had n't been exposed to someone with measles . That denial catapulted her into lobbying against compulsory vaccination in Ontario . Then in 1992 she formed Variance ( now called VRAN ) , which has 200 members across Canada . Even though some parents are opposed to immunization , the majority do go ahead with the recommended schedule of vaccinations . In fact , Health Canada surveys suggest that less than one percent of Canadian parents ever refuse , says Duclos . However , he acknowledges that another five to ten percent " sit on the fence . They do not feel wholly comfortable about vaccination . " The reason may be the various controversial reports that parents have heard about vaccines  --  particularly the pertussis vaccine , which was developed in the 1930s . Dr. Ron Gold is a recently retired infectious - disease specialist at Toronto 's Hospital for Sick Children ( as well as a consultant to government and to Connaught Laboratories , a vaccine manufacturer ) . He explains that " the pertussis vaccine formulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe reactions . " Specifically , it caused high fevers and accompanying febrile convulsions . Dr. Gold says that some children also began a condition of high - pitched crying or screaming that would last for hours after the injection . Its questionable reputation persisted well into the ' ' 70s . At that time , the deaths of two Japanese children from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome were blamed on the pertussis vaccine . Despite an investigation into the cases that exonerated the vaccine , many parents subsequently refused to immunize their infants against the disease . That massive boycott prompted the Japanese government to change its public policy and allowed parents to postpone their children 's first pertussis shot ( until the age of two years , instead of at two months ) . Meanwhile , in other countries , the pertussis vaccine 's safety record was also being questioned . British anti - vaccination groups were claiming a link between the vaccine and neurological damage . At this news , the British public boycotted the vaccine in droves ; immunization levels fell dramatically . The boycott resulted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1976 and 1979 , which concluded there was insufficient evidence to link the vaccine with permanent brain damage . The unfortunate consequence of the British boycott was a dangerous upsurge in pertussis : In 1976 , there were about 3,000 cases ; in 1978 , that number rose to more than 65,000 . Pertussis itself can cause brain damage and death ; some 400,000 children around the world die annually from the disease . ( In Sweden , for example , where the vaccine is not used , pertussis cases are 16 times higher than in Ontario . ) In other countries immunologists began surveys of their own . " There were three large studies in the United States , for example , that could not identify any link between the pertussis vaccine and brain damage , " says Gold . Over the past seven years , Health Canada and 11 children 's hospitals across the country have been watching for any serious reactions to the pertussis vaccine . When a child under the age of two enters these hospitals with any acute neurological problem , hospital staff records that child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer database . Notes Gold : " As yet , we have not received any adverse reports . " But , he adds , it is very difficult to prove that the pertussis vaccine never causes brain damage . All the controversy around the current pertussis vaccine may now be a moot point , given the introduction of a new injection that is already available in Japan . A similar vaccine has been licensed in Canada and will be introduced soon . This new vaccine is made with only a portion of the bacteria 's cell wall instead of the whole organism . Gold says that the new vaccine , called acellular pertussis , has drastically lessened the side effects of fever and convulsions , so much so that Japanese children are again being immunized at the age of two months . And Sweden , which shunned the old vaccine , has been using acellular pertussis since last April . Despite all the assurances by the medical establishment , there are still some parents who have chosen not to vaccinate . When Heather Stephen of Toronto was pregnant with her daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get her hands on . One in particular piqued her curiosity : What Every Parent Should Know about Childhood Immunization . When it came time to have her two - month - old immunized , she hesitated . Her doctor , who is a personal friend , explained the risks and benefits and supplied her with some background reading on the issue . Stephen did more sleuthing . She contacted Toronto 's Connaught Laboratories to obtain more information , and talked to an expert on the measles vaccine at Health Canada . Armed with all that research , Stephen and her husband have decided not to have Nicole , now two , immunized . " I will concede that vaccinations have reduced the incidence of diseases , but we 'd rather have Nicole get measles , for example , and handle that than inject her with a vaccine . " And although she is afraid that her daughter might suffer from other diseases , she still believes that the risk is worth it . Larry Hough of Toronto , father of Olivia , also two , feels just the opposite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about vaccinations and we know about the fears . Our paediatrician explained all the risks of immunizations , including fever , allergic reactions and brain damage . But we felt that the risks of not having the shots are a lot greater than the risks of immunization . " Ron Gold realizes that parents must weigh the risks and the benefits of vaccines , but says they should keep the risk in perspective . " There 's much more risk involved in driving your child to the doctor 's office to get a vaccination , than from a vaccine itself , " he notes . While not all parents are totally reassured by such statements , others , like Larry Hough , feel the choice is clear : " Why would we make any people suffer the consequences of the disease themselves if we can help it ?

Making Decisions With Your Doctor Much of the information available about immunization is conflicting , fuelled by strong emotions from the various sources . Because of this , your relationship with your child 's doctor becomes essential in choosing your course of action . You need to feel confident that the doctor will listen to your concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adverse reaction to an initial vaccination , that the doctor will take this new information very seriously . In no way should parents have to convince a physician of what they observe in their child and the resulting need to reassess further immunization . In fact , a previous severe reaction to any vaccine is the one contraindication agreed upon by both the medical and the anti - immunization communities . Most children do not have any reaction to the shots , but some can experience a mild fever , rash and soreness at the site of the injection . If your child has a high fever , convulsions or other symptoms you are not sure about , consult the doctor immediately . There are other contra - indications . A child with a history of seizures , or with a sibling or a parent who has seizures , should be carefully assessed . A child with a severe allergy to egg protein should avoid immunization against measles , mumps and rubella . Any child with cancer , leukaemia or lymphoma , or other diseases that affect the immune system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three vaccines as well . Most children , of course , are in good health . However , should your child become moderately ill ( a fever or an illness more serious than a cold ) on the day of vaccination , postpone your appointment . Some parents have considered delaying the timing of the first vaccination  --  from two months to four or six months . This is a decision to be made with your doctor . The idea behind this delay is to give an infant 's immune system a chance to mature before introducing the stress of vaccines . However , it 's vital to consider important factors such as whether the baby is breastfed , and whether he is in group daycare . There are other options , too . For example , parents can request that their child receive only the diphtheria and tetanus without the pertussis part of the DPT vaccine if this is the component they most want to avoid . They can also ask to have their child 's blood tested after the first MMR shot to see if she has developed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a second dose . Parents who decide not to vaccinate may need to get an exemption . Health ministries across Canada strongly recommend immunization as a preventive measure , and some provinces have laws in place to cover school - aged children . Under the Ontario Immunization of School Pupils Act , for example , parents who choose not to have their child vaccinated on medical , philosophical or religious grounds must obtain an exemption form , available from their local health department . Be aware that if you exempt your child , for example , from the measles vaccination , he may be required to stay home for two weeks should a measles outbreak occur . Wrestling with immunization decisions does n't have to be done alone . Make sure your doctor respects your questions and concerns . Keep in mind , too , that your point of view may change over time , and you should feel comfortable enough with your physician to discuss issues openly as they arise . Time for a Shot ? DPT + Polio + Act - HIB ( at two , four , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a serious and potentially fatal bacterial infection of the throat . It releases a toxin into the bloodstream that can damage the heart , nerve tissue and throat . Pertussis , also known as whooping cough , is a bacteria that causes mucus to clog the airways of the lungs , which makes it difficult to breathe . It is extremely dangerous for babies under the age of 12 months , who may fail to get enough oxygen . Tetanus is a rare but serious bacteria commonly found around farms , on rusty metal , and in household dust , garden dirt and gravel . It usually enters the body through a scrape or a cut with anything from a rose thorn to a piece of barbed wire . Tetanus makes a toxin that causes uncontrollable muscle contractions first in the jaw muscles ( thus the name lockjaw ) and then the rest of the body . If the spasms affect the muscles involved in breathing , death can result . Polio is a viral infection of the spinal cord and nerves . Most cases only cause a fever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those children recover completely . The virus can also cause paralysis and death . The Haemophilus influenza type b bacteria was , until very recently , the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in young children . Meningitis is a potentially fatal inflammation of the membranes , or meanings , that sheathe the brain and spinal cord . MMR  --  Measles , Mumps and Rubella ( at 12 months and a second shot recently required after a minimum one - month waiting period ) Measles is a highly infectious viral disease . A child may suffer from the symptoms of a cold with a high fever , and then a rash of brown - red spots . Complications can include ear infection and pneumonia . Encephalitis , an inflammation of the brain , occurs in one out of 2,000 cases and can lead to brain damage . Mumps , another viral infection , causes the salivary glands to swell up , which can make it painful to swallow . Sometimes there is fever and the testes or ovaries may also become distended , creating pain in the lower abdomen .
