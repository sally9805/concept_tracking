<p> Illegal immigrants are n't causing Colorado 's problems <p> The April 30 op-ed column by Tom Tancredo , executive director of a conservative " think tank , " contained misleading stats on the supposed number of illegals in Colorado and their financial cost to taxpayers . <p> Now I know Tom , and it 's not the numbers that are bugging him . We have debated California 's Proposition 187 on AM 760 KTLK radio , and debated everything else on public television station Channel 12 's public affairs show . No , with Tom it 's not the numbers , it 's " culture . " Tom fears a cultural Apocalypse if the U.S. does n't clamp down on illegals . <p> Quoting John O'Sullivan , Tom writes , " Immigration and the multiculturalism it feeds are threatening to dissolve the bonds of common nationhood and the underlying sense of a common national destiny , bringing forward the danger of a balkanized America . " <p> Tom is so fearful he even suggests that legal immigration threatens our republic . In an article appearing in Denver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we face a cultural " meltdown of the bonds that held us together as a country . " <p> Tom 's cultural fascism is beyond annoying - it 's dangerous and obnoxiously ignorant of historical fact . <p> This great country was " multicultural " at its founding , notwithstanding that at the time of the 1787 Constitutional Convention , its framers chose not to bestow constitutional recognition to its Indian , black and female residents . Well , there was some recognition : for taxing purposes , one slave was to be considered 3/5 of a person . <p> I am the first to acknowledge that illegal immigration carries a financial price tag to our state , and that U.S. immigration policy and enforcement are in need of serious and thoughtful reform . But it 's not illegal immigration that has Colorado , or this country , on the brink of Apocalypse . <p> If we are experiencing a meltdown , it 's due in large part to those of us who were born and raised right here in the good ol ' U.S.A. : it 's American teens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't have a clue how to love and provide for ; it 's American fathers who have run out on their emotional and financial obligations to their children ; it 's American legislatures and voters who underfund education and treat teachers with contempt ; it 's American kids who treat education and discipline as a joke . <p> And in Colorado - who is clogging our highways , turning Interstate 70 into a sluggish mass of steel and exhaust - fouling our air , fouling and depleting our drinking water - slapping a housing development or a mall on every precious bit of soil in our state ? It 's not illegal immigrants - although they might be tapped for the low-paying , no-benefits jobs servicing the hordes of new , legal arrivals gravitating to our mountain and resort communities . <p> But Tom wo n't let these facts or common sense get in his way . This is war - culture war . Immigrants , legal and illegal , are in the cross hairs . <p> DANI NEWSUM <p> Denver <p> Children are n't protected by El Paso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Springs offers troubled families second chance , " describes a new program in El Paso County that creates a " non-adversarial " without court oversight ) program to offer help to families whose children have been abused or neglected . Bob VanCleave ( El Paso 's Social Services director ) lauds his program . However , there are serious concerns : <p> 1 . The program VanCleave describes is in place in Missouri . A subcommittee of Colorado 's Recodification of the Children 's Code is considering a similar program for Colorado . Because there are no long-term statistics defining child safety , it is hoped that the program will be combined with citizen oversight to ensure child protection . The abuse must be first-time abuse . <p> 2 . EPDSS 's guidelines are shocking . Families must have children under age 12 ( the most vulnerable child population ) and fewer than four contacts with social services . A child may have been raped or brutalized three times , yet , at the most tender age , will not be provided protective oversight by a court system . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children may be denied true protection from further damage , again and again . This program must deal only with first-time offenders . <p> 3 . VanCleave asserts that this program will enable Social Services to do things " for families , not to families . " Abusive parents have already done something to their vulnerable children . Reality and common sense demand that chronic abusers must understand further brutality against their children may result in negative consequences . <p> El Paso taxpayers should demand clearer , tighter guidelines for child protection . <p> ADOREE BLAIR <p> Littleton <p> Airlines do n't make money at an alarming rate <p> While much has been written about commission caps and the plight of the agents , as an agent I believe that perhaps we should change the focus to the airlines and their plight . Airlines needed to impose the commission caps due to their inability to make money over the last several years under deregulation . As a newcomer to the industry , but an observer of business in general over the last 20 years , I have noticed that airlines do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pursue the problem of consistent red on the bottom line of the airlines with some rational ideas about the general conduct of business . How many businesses can you name that make money by consistently infuriating their largest group of customers ? The business traveler is punished consistently by having to pay the highest fares and travel subject to the most restrictions . <p> The leisure traveler can be flexible and travel when the fares are best , buying tickets to see Aunt Martha or Grandma when the fares are lowest . They consistently stay out of the market and wait for the next " fare war . " After the airlines see that their seats are not filling up at $ 600 from Denver to Florida , they lower the price to $ 250 and sell out their inventory . After a few years of this practice , leisure travelers have caught on . <p> The practice of pricing products based in some way on the costs involved in their production does not alienate your customers ; in fact , it is the sign of a competitive market . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small businesses <p> I am writing in regard to two articles on Small Business Incubators in The Denver Post 's Business section April 23 and 24 . <p> The articles coincided with Small-Business Week , and I assume they were written to provide comprehensive information to citizens , entrepreneurs and the business community in general . <p> Both articles omitted coverage of our incubator except for a phone number in a little box under the article . <p> This incubator was formed as a non-profit corporation to create jobs through small business development . Being between housing projects in the Curtis Park neighborhood , it gives opportunities and positive role models for minorities . <p> Even with all the barriers to success that come with the stereotype of this location , we won the " Milestone Achievement Award " from the Denver Chamber of Commerce in 1994 and " graduated " nine small companies this past year . <p> DAVID M. GONZALES , Ed.D . <p> Denver Enterprise Center Inc . <p> Denver <p> Why should taxpayers pay <p> for Envirotest 's training ? <p> In the private sector , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obligation of that vendor to deliver . <p> It is clear that Envirotest was not , and still is not , prepared to do the emission testing . <p> State Sen. Sally Hopper asks , " How can we perfect the system if it is shut down ? " <p> Frankly , perfecting the system is not our problem , Senator Hopper . <p> Asking the taxpayers to underwrite Envirotest 's learning curve is an unreasonable burden . <p> Here are some other reasons to suspend the process for one year : <p> 1 . This is an unfunded mandate . <p> 2 . There are not enough stations . I just had my 1994 GMC Sierra tested . The drive was 25 miles in each direction . Think about the added pollution . <p> 3 . The system is too expensive . <p> 4 . It has failed in other states . <p> 5 . No one understands the rules , i.e. , " How does the repair cap work ? " <p> 6 . The competency of Envirotest employees is suspect . <p> Support a one-year suspension . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CASCARELLI <p> Evergreen <p> Is the news selected <p> to support Post 's views ? <p> Can you possibly represent your report on What Coloradans Think on Today 's Question , " Is it a good idea to make it easier to get concealed weapons , " as a fair sample of what Coloradans really think ? <p> When you present responses from six individuals , all with the same position , is that your way of being objective in assessing a true perspective of public opinion on this or any issue ? <p> As is too often the case with The Denver Post , you take a position on an issue and then you start your
