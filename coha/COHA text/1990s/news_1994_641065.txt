<p> After a very good year for the state economy , many Colorado business leaders have strong expectations for 1994 . <p> They also have high expectations for the Clinton administration , which finished 1993 on a strong economic note after a stumbling start . And they 're deeply worried about social issues . <p> Most of the business people we talked to for this informal survey , gave President Clinton relatively high marks for talking the right talk . His jawboning on health care , for example , has helped curb price increases for 1994 . <p> But business leaders increasingly are worried about the nation 's social agenda . Their concern is a reflection of the fact that guns have moved from the street to the workplace . <p> And businesses are beginning to recognize that the nation 's education problems are beginning to affect America 's competitiveness in the world economy . <p> Attacking violence in our society and in the workplace , improving education and taking a firm but flexible approach to reforming health care are the headline issues of The Denver Post 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Chairman , CEO <p> Public Service Co. of Colorado , Denver <p> President Clinton has framed the right issues , now he 's got to walk the talk . <p> Violence is a major problem and it needs to be dealt with . My perception is that there 's an awful lot of money being poured into possible solutions but the effort needs better direction . We need more local control over funds and more flexibility to deal with each community 's problems at a grassroots level . <p> I think President Clinton needs to put great emphasis on deficit reduction and have courage to step up to entitlements and make some changes . You 've got to begin with Medicare and Social Security . We hesitate to talk about these issues but we know where the dollars are . <p> In the energy business , the Department of Energy must step up to its nuclear-waste commitments . The government has collected tons of money from our industry but the money for nuclear waste disposal has n't been spent . <p> Mo Siegel <p> Founder , CEO <p> Celestial Seasonings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stop the violence in this country . We need to do something about health costs . They 're going up like crazy . <p> I 'm unhappy that Clinton raised taxes ; it 's been nerve wracking to me . But basically , I 'm bullish on future of our economy . <p> I think the next five years will be stellar and I ca n't see us not doing well as a country and as a world . There is a propensity for the world to do well in the last decade of a century and this is also the end of a millenium . <p> Let 's keep interest rates down and concentrate on helping companies like ours make money . Finally , I 'd offer this advice : Thing are generally going in the right direction so do n't screw up the landing . <p> Joyce Meskis <p> Owner , Tattered Cover Bookstore , Denver <p> First , a humorous suggestion . President Clinton should close the government down for a day , except the libraries and order everyone to read a book . The creative exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On a more serious note , I think that there 's a great temptation to act , but many of the world 's problems require lots of thought . <p> Problems that have n't been created in a day ca n't be solved with 24-hour solutions . <p> From an economic perspective , we need healthful economic development , we need to be attentive to health care issues and we need a mentally healthy society . We need tolerance and an open-minded society . <p> There 's a lot of violence in the streets but we may be on a slippery slope to losing freedom - rights for all if we act to quickly . We have to act , but we need to act responsibly in the long run , not in the way one special interest wants us to . <p> Bill Daniels , <p> Cable pioneer , chairman Daniels &; Associates , Denver <p> We 're in the middle of a telecommunications revolution . The cable industry can compete with satellite companies and telephone companies , but we must keep the government out of micro-managing any venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money around to invest but you 've got to give people an incentive to back new entrepreneurs and new ventures . This is a nice way of saying we need to cut capital gains taxes . <p> In Colorado , cable now employs more than 10,000 people in the state ; the more incentives you give people to invest the faster they 'll invest the money and the faster the jobs will grow . <p> On other issues , we 've heard no real conversation about controlling the deficit . And we must overhaul the welfare system ; the idea of having a second or third or fourth generation of people growing up on welfare is unthinkable . <p> Joel Edelman , <p> President and CEO , Rose Medical Center , Denver <p> The president has a tendency to try to do too much all at the same time . He 's got to reinvigorate his efforts on health-care reform ; he seems to be turning a little soft on that issue . <p> But whether it 's ' 94 or ' 95 he 's got to show some political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a favorable impact on the economy if he does n't go down the road of higher taxes . <p> I 'd be very concerned about any more taxes that would snuff out the recovery . <p> Norman Brownstein , <p> Denver lawyer , political fund-raiser <p> The major issue for 1994 is health-care reform . The only way it will get done is if Clinton leads us through the morass . <p> I 'd warn him to be very flexible . For example , he 's said that everything was negotiable except universal coverage - coverage for everyone . But universal coverage has to be dealt with very carefully . The costs related to it are astronomical . Health care reform has to be done judiciously . <p> Joseph Hardiman , <p> CEO , president , NASDAQ Stock Market , Washington , D.C. <p> The president should continue to push hard on the North American Free Trade Agreement and GATT - trade initiatives which have been very successful in 1993 . <p> We need to flesh out this success with initiatives to help small business enterprises , either through tax benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Lastly I would urge him to address the whole issue of the workforce that 's going to be available to American businesses in the latter part of this decade . There is an urgent need for education and training of that workforce . <p> Ernest Tafoya , <p> Chairman , Hispanic Chamber , Denver <p> Education is the key . Starting from grade school on , there are a a lot of costs , including health-care costs , could be kept down by education . If the education system worked better , we could make investments in young people that would pay off down the road . <p> We could make better use of a lot of the social tools already in place , making them more effective . My advice would be this : If it is n't broke , fix it again . <p> Neel Levy , <p> Chairman , Colorado Black Chamber , Denver <p> Bill Clinton should continue to be aggressive and innovative in pursuing small business advantages . His approach has been positive so far . <p> One of major concerns is health insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it and small businesses ca n't afford to buy it . <p> Bill Ellis , <p> President and chief operating officer , Piper , Jaffray , Hopwood , Minneapolis <p> The Federal Reserve has done a good job of managing interest rates and I 'd urge the president to leave the Fed alone . Do n't stimulate the economy too much , having slow growth is OK . <p> I think the ultimate goal is balancing the budget ; that means spending should come down . <p> I 'd say that when it comes to setting spending priorities education , crime and the legal system are out of kilter and need to be fixed . I 'd watch out for the hidden cost of health care . I 'd take a look at what 's working in Minnesota ; we 're making good headway on health care without government mandates . <p> Our economic system is working with cheap land , cheap labor and cheap capital , let 's keep our competitive juices flowing .
