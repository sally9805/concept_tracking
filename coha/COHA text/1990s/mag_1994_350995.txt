It 's hard to remember , and perhaps you tried to forget , but Hammer and Vanilla Ice were the two most popular rappers in America just four years ago . Hammer 's album Please Hammer Do n't Hurt ' Em and Ice 's To the Extreme each sold more than 15 million copies worldwide . Both albums were pure Top 40 , accessorized with rap cliches . But then the kids started listening to low- ridin ' , gun-totin ' , allegedly **27;1344;TOOLONG ' rappers like Snoop Doggy Dogg , and Hammer and Ice seemed about as corny as silver medalists at a Disney parade . <P> Now Hammer has a CD titled The Funky Headhunter , Ice has one called Mind Blowin ' , and both are presenting themselves as OGs  --  Original Gangstas . Where Hammer used to wear harem pants and dancing shoes , he now appears in jeans and combat boots . After all , who 's afraid of a guy in puffy pants ? Hammer also now indulges in the requisite rapper carnality : in the video for his new song Pumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cavorts with bikini-clad women . Most of the parties involved are slathered in enough body oil to spawn a sequel to On Deadly Ground . As for Ice , his blond pompadour is gone in favor of droopy dreadlocks . Instead of looking like a tour guide for Graceland , he resembles yet another long-lost heir angling for a piece of the Bob Marley estate . <P> Although Hammer and Ice are both attempting to break with their unthreatening pasts , neither can resist recalling the anodyne megahits of yore . " Twenty-five million records , 20 countries and got love from 100 million , " Hammer boasts in a spoken introduction to The Funky Headhunter . " You know you ca n't fade it . " On his album , Ice raps , " My first LP went way over 11 million/ So do n't front ' cause I know you were an Ice Fan . " Both are also eager to avenge past slights . " Bust ' em in the back of their head , " goes the chorus to the title track of Hammer 's album @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " And Ice threatens , " A few suckers need their throat slit/ Jealous ' cause I went multiplatinum/ Now I 'm going to blast ' em in the head till they 're dead with my Magnum . " Do n't call it gangsta rap ; call it sulking-star , self-pity rap . <P> Amid all the posturing , though , the two albums actually contain a few good songs . Hammer is a classy guy , businesslike and religious . Although he 's trying to act tough , the most successful numbers on The Funky Headhunter  --  Clap Yo ' Hands and One Mo ' Time  --  have him riding the current wave of laid-back rap . The two songs grind along at an easy pace and feature sweet melodies that are n't obscured by Hammer 's usual rhythmic assault .
