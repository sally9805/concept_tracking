It 's a clear night , the first after a long spell of cloudy weather . You 're eager to finally get an evening 's use of your telescope . Saturn is well placed in the sky and you 're looking forward to a great view . But wait . Instead of crisp images , you see a featureless blur . Has something gone wrong with your telescope ! No . Chances are the culprit is n't your optics but turbulence in the atmosphere . Even when the weather cooperates with cloudless skies , you may find yourself faced with what 's known as " poor seeing conditions . " You might think that poor seeing would be like the weather itself  --  one of those things that everybody complains about but nobody can do anything about . But this is n't entirely true . You can take several steps to minimize the blurring effects of turbulence so you can get the most out of those much-anticipated clear nights . LOOKING SHARP Ideally , a telescope 's optics take parallel light rays from the sky and bring them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rays travel through a long column of air within Earth 's atmosphere before reaching the telescope . Air , like the glass in a lens , bends light , and the column of air in front of a telescope is as much a part of your optical system as any lens or mirror in the telescope . Air bends light differently depending upon its density which , in turn , depends on the air 's temperature . If a column of air has the same temperature all along its length , then the image formed by the telescope will look sharp and steady . Under these ideal conditions , you 'd get the sharpest possible view . But on most nights , the air column is riddled with layers of varying temperature . In this case , each layer acts as a lens with a different refractive index  --  each bends the incoming light slightly differently . This causes light rays making up an image to arrive at the telescope via different pathways and to arrive at slightly different spots in the eyepiece . The result is a less-than-perfect image  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus . Perhaps it will waver or move around . Only occasionally will it snap into focus . Stars will look like bloated , squirming fuzzballs , not crisp points . Close double stars will merge into elongated blurs . Unfortunately , viewing on most nights is hampered by some degree of poor seeing . Sometimes it 's like looking through the rising heat waves over a road during a hot summer day  --  the image is a hopeless blur . But on most nights , the effect of poor seeing is much less noticeable . The differences from night to night , or even during a single night , arise because the disturbances in the atmosphere change size . It is the size of these disturbances compared to the size of your telescope 's aperture that affects how bad the seeing will appear . A common dictum is that small telescopes are not affected as much by poor seeing . For example , set two telescopes side by side , a 4-inch and a 16-inch , and aim both at Saturn . The 4-inch telescope takes in a 4-inch-wide column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider . If the waves of disturbed air are about 4 inches across ( as is typical on many nights ) , Saturn will look satisfyingly sharp in the 4-inch scope  --  the air within the column is relatively stable . But the entire air column is moving back and forth as a whole . As a result , the image in the 4-inch wobbles around the field . Now look through the 16-inch scope . Its large aperture is looking through several waves at once . Saturn now stays put , but looks blurry and is beset with ripples washing over its disk . At first glance the image in the 4-inch looks sharper . It does n't seem to be wavering in and out of focus as much . But watch carefully through the 16-inch scope . Occasionally , Saturn settles down . If conditions are average , this wo n't happen often . But when it does , it will be like lifting a veil from the image . The 16-inch scope will definitely show more detail than the 4-inch , but only during fleeting moments of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , large telescopes , more often than small , are affected by poor seeing . It takes an exceptionally steady night for a large-aperture telescope to perform at its best . However , no matter what size telescope you own you still have to contend with turbulence in the air . After a while you realize that poor seeing takes different forms . For practical purposes , we can divide seeing conditions into three major types . KEEPING YOUR COOL : TYPE 1 SEEING During what I call Type 1 seeing , images undergo rapid changes . The limb of an extended object , such as the Moon or a planet , appears to shimmer . The edge of the Moon or a planet splits into two or more separate limbs and the image oscillates rapidly from one limb to another . Point sources , such as stars , occasionally appear double or even triple . The image of an out-of-focus star appears granular or boiling . You might be able to catch glimpses of fine details on the Moon or a planet , but for the most part , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get a good look . The causes of Type 1 seeing are air currents with very small sizes relative to the telescope aperture ( approximately one-tenth to one-fourth the aperture of the telescope ) . The disturbing waves are often within the telescope tube itself or very close to the telescope . These small waves effectively divide the telescope into a number of smaller apertures which are in constant motion with respect to each other . This explains the multiple images . The sources of Type 1 disturbances include a telescope tube and optics not cooled down to the night air temperature , heat waves conducted from your body to the telescope tube , heat waves from people near the telescope , and heated dew caps . To eliminate this type of seeing , always allow at least 30 minutes for the telescope tube to reach ambient temperature . ( Cool-down can take an hour or more if the night is cold or the telescope is large . ) If you have a reflector with an open tube that you normally cover with a cloth light shield , then leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once the telescope tube has cooled down , avoid it . Move the telescope tube by grabbing the mount or tube handles instead . To keep heat waves from wafting in front of the telescope , stand downwind from the tube as much as possible . Do n't walk or stand in front of your telescope . When observing in a group , allow plenty of space between you and other observers . FURTHER AFIELD : TYPE 2 SEEING With Type 2 seeing , images do n't move as rapidly as they do under Type 1 conditions but are decidedly blurred . The limbs of lunar and planetary disks appear single but indistinct  --  planets appear surrounded by a glow . Fine details on lunar or planetary disks are invisible . Overall contrast is diminished . Star images are not pinpoints but spread out . Out-of-focus images of stars show colorful twinkling . Type 2 air currents have sizes that are typically one-half your telescope 's aperture . The effect of waves of this size is to impart different focal lengths to different parts of your mirror or lens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optical flaw in which the main mirror or lens has no precise focal point . Type 2 seeing originates in the lower atmosphere , often from heat waves rising from the ground and from nearby buildings . Different materials radiate heat at different rates . Concrete and buildings radiate heat more rapidly than grass does . Land radiates heat more rapidly than water . If you are looking over an area where two dissimilar terrains meet , you 'll be looking through air of different temperatures and densities . At night , for example , cool air from a mountain top will turbulently tumble down the mountainside into a valley , creating cool mountain breezes and poor seeing conditions . A similar situation occurs near bodies of water . Shortly after sunset , the land will be cooler than the water . As warm air continues to rise over the water , cool air from the land rushes in to replace it , giving rise to sea breezes . After a cold front passes and skies clear , Type 2 seeing can occur over a large area . In this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colder air mass above  --  the ground radiates heat into the air , causing a widespread Type 2 disturbance . The best remedy for Type 2 seeing is to move your telescope to a better location . Avoid areas overlooking heated buildings , parking lots , or large expanses of heat-retaining concrete . Select a location well inland rather than near a beach , lake shore , or river . Open areas within flat grassy fields are good locations . An observing site on top of a broad hill or mountain plateau is often better than one in a valley or on a downslope . If you ca n't move , you can always wait . Most cooling of the surroundings is completed by midnight or 1:00 a.m . Because of this , lunar and planetary photographers often get their best photos in the early hours of the morning . If you own a 10-inch or larger scope , try stopping-down your telescope 's aperture . ( Use a mask with a 4- to 6-inch hole in it . ) Although your telescope will perform like a smaller scope , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing sometimes outweigh the loss of resolution from the reduced aperture . LOOKING UP : TYPE 3 SEEING With Type 3 seeing , images look fairly sharp most of the time but are subject to fast ripples . The limb of the Moon or a planet looks single but wavers noticeably . You can see fine lunar or planetary details but they shift slightly in position from moment to moment . Star images are crisp but are also in slight motion . They appear to dance in small circles or patterns . The cause of Type 3 seeing lies in the upper atmosphere , far above the telescope . These disturbances have wavelengths that are very large relative to your telescope 's aperture , often three or more times larger . Their effect is to distort the image and its position slightly , much as waves on the surface of a swimming pool or pond distort the apparent position of something in the water . If you get the impression that you are viewing through rippling water , then you are probably dealing with Type 3 seeing . Because its source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to improve this type of seeing . Stopping-down your telescope is worth a try . In this case , however , the loss of resolution from the smaller aperture usually outweighs the small improvement in seeing . There really is nothing you can do about Type 3 seeing ( as there is little you can do about the weather ) . But happily , its effects are usually mild . A Type 3 night is still a good night for viewing . Of course , dividing up atmospheric seeing into three neat types is an ideal situation . In reality , the three kinds of poor seeing often occur in combination . On those nights , your eyepiece will present a confusing picture . Still , if you take care to correct the sources of Type 1 and Type 2 disturbances , you should see a noticeable improvement in the view through your telescope . Getting around the sources of bad seeing that are beyond your control simply takes the patience to wait for nights and moments of steady air . On those happy occasions , you 'll be rewarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stars as your telescope is capable of .
