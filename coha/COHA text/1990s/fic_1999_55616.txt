BEAUTY IS NOT A VIRTUE . And beauty is not in the eye of the beholder . Beauty is a fact like height or symmetry or hair color . Understand that I am not bragging when I say I am the most beautiful woman in the bar . <p> Normally I can make this claim without hesitation , because this is my regular bar . But tonight the circus is in town , and there are strangers here , including four showgirls at a table between me and the jukebox drinking what look like vodka tonics  --  tall , clear drinks with maraschino cherries . <p> Whenever the circus comes to the Palace , I attend , as I did tonight with my sister , who now drums her fingers on the bar beside me . <p> " What did you like best ? " she asks . <p> I shrug . My sister gets annoyed when I refuse to talk , but I do not like to answer questions I have not thought about . <p> " How about that rhinoceros ? " she says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that woman did n't slide off . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Why do you come here ? " asks my sister , spinning around once on her stool . " There 's nothing to do . " She spins again . " You should tell them to get magnetic darts or something . " <p> My sister always chatters this way . She is warm , communicative , and generous , and I am not  --  just ask any of my three ex-husbands . If you want to know the other difficulties of being close to me , you will have to ask them or her , because I do not intend to enumerate my faults . My sister and I have similar eyes , mouths , and hair , and it is a puzzle why I am more beautiful than she . Perhaps it is because she has developed so many other interests . She is a social worker in a hospital , helping fifty families a day in whatever ways she can ; she belongs to a softball league ; she has a husband who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will probably have her first child . I work at a hotel , where part of my job is to look good . <p> " If you 're not going to talk to me , I 'm leaving , " my sister says . " I 've got stuff I can do at home . " She downs her cranberry juice and heads for the door . <p> This is a typical end to our evenings together . I can not explain to her that , though I love her company , I do not want to talk . As she exits , two big men in circus coveralls enter , accompanied by the smallest man in the world . The big men have identical builds , but one is white with blond hair and slightly crossed eyes , and the other is black and scruffy-headed . Both give the impression that the coveralls are the only clothes they own . When they reach the bar , these two bend in unison , and the small man straightens his arms and allows himself to be lifted onto a stool , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his credit , Martin the bartender does not ask for identification , but brings the small man his whiskey and soda in a professional way that does not suggest surprise that such a tiny man would want a drink , or indeed that a man would be so tiny . <p> As usual , I sit at the far end of the counter , on the brass-and-leather stool nearest the wall , so I can see everyone in the place . The wooden bar curves away from me and stretches thirty feet , halfway to the front door , and is stained a reddish color beneath layers of polyurethane . The wall opposite me is raw brick , lined with low-wattage fixtures designed to look like gas lanterns . After working all day in bright light , ! find the dimness comforting . <p> The smallest man in the world looks at the patrons one by one , then settles his gaze on me and nods . His hair is thinning . With a closed mouth , I smile . He holds up his drink in my direction , in appreciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciation of his smallness . <p> I have compared beauty and height , but there is more in common between beauty and smallness : conciseness , the correct arrangement of parts in a confined area . Space has not been wasted on the smallest man in the world . He is perfectly formed , with limbs , trunk , and ears all in proportion . Only at the most perfunctory glance does he look like a child , for he has a serious forehead and a square jaw . His face is slightly swollen , most likely from drinking , but his size obscures this fact . An art teacher once showed me the trick of making a black ink drawing and then shrinking it on a copy machine  --  in the reduction , the flaws are less perceptible . <p> As appears to be the case with the smallest man in the world , I sometimes drink too much . When I develop that swollen look , I disguise it by loosening my hair . Drinking is , of course , an ordinary addiction ; it is not peculiar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal-sized people drink too much . Take , for instance , the sweaty man who has been coming in for the last few months with his shirt buttons more and more strained  --  he has the look of a man embroiled in an unpleasant divorce . That woman at the other end of the bar must be seventy , maybe with grandchildren , and she drinks to excess nightly , done up in foundation and blusher . The edge of her glass is smeared halfway around with lipstick . <p> My sister appears in the doorway behind the made-up old woman and makes her way back to me , jangling her keys . <p> " I forgot that I drove you here . How are you getting home ? " <p> " I can take a cab . Do not worry about me , little sister . " <p> " OK , take care of yourself . I 'll see you soon . " She touches my shoulder to prove her concern . My sister is a caring person , no doubt , but I get the feeling she is worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wherever I came I brought calamity , " Tennyson quotes Helen of Troy . My sister knows that when I get drunk I become friendly , and she knows that men who came into the bar with perfectly nice women or who have left at home women as pretty and caring as my sister will risk future happiness in order to spend the night with me . Some may consider my willingness to go home with such men reprehensible ; you also may blame the Trojan War on Helen 's misbehavior . Keep in mind , though , that Helen did not launch a single warship . And in the end she paid a great price for her affair with Paris : while you and I are able to toss off married names for fifty dollars and some paperwork , she remains Helen of Troy for all eternity . No matter that she settled happily with Menelaus in Athens and had a child . <p> My sister almost brushes against the circus men on the way out , and the white guy turns to watch her leave . She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . <p> A pale-skinned couple enters and sits on stools halfway down . Perhaps they have been to a play . They move in unison , their once-independent bodies working as complementary parts of a whole . He helps her take off her coat , and she gets him something from her purse . The smallest man in the world jumps down and walks toward the jukebox , onto which his friends lift him . When a song skips , Martin the bartender looks over coolly , but to his credit does not yell , " Get off the jukebox . " Though it has never occurred to me before , I consider this bartender a good friend . <p> Twenty years ago , when I was in high school , my mother and sister , hoping I could make friends , encouraged me to enter my first and only beauty contest . But even then I recognized most of those girls as shallow and hopeless bits of fluff , unaware of what freaks we were making of ourselves . And , of course , they hated me for winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself pioneered the modern beauty contest , recognizing that striking beauty was fundamentally no different from any other aberration . Such absurdly perfect integration of a woman 's features and shape was not unlike a third arm growing from the center of another woman 's back . Barnum was the first to realize that strangers would pay to see this sort of female oddity paraded before them . <p> The sweaty man with the strained buttons walks by on his way to the bathroom . When he glances at me , he trips over a carpet runner ; he catches himself and regains his balance awkwardly , as though his body has recently become a stranger to him . I tend my body with such care that I can not imagine losing touch with it  --  I am far more likely to lose my mind , something nobody notices . The man looks away as he straightens himself up , and a few minutes later he returns to his seat by a circuitous route . <p> In a thick accent , the smallest man in the world yells something to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Brandy , " he then shouts , several times , and I first think he is ordering a drink . " You looking pretty tonight . " His voice is nasal and high-pitched , sadly comical . <p> The red-haired woman turns and shouts . " Why 'd you follow us here ? find your own bar , shrimp . " <p> " You are my loving , Miss Brandy . " His voice is far more sad than comic . The showgirl shakes her head and turns back to her friends , who laugh . She lights a cigarette . <p> At the jukebox the two men who accompany the smallest man in the world stand near him so they form an equilateral triangle , as if this can protect him . They are heartbroken at what transpires between their small man and the showgirls . After all , they must love him ; they have become attached to his smallness the way men become attached to my beauty . When a man is with me , he can not forget my beauty the way he forgets everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are meals created with attention to every detail of taste and presentation . Even the loveliness of naked breasts can mean nothing when those remain covered for too long . But his size is a constant reminder , as is my face . <p> I do not like to see my own face , because , despite my makeup , I look sad  --  sometimes as sad as that rouged old woman slumped over the bar down the way . When I fix my face in the morning , it often occurs to me to make myself up as a clown by lipsticking a massive smile onto my cheeks . Or exaggerating the sadness by painting a frown and a few shiny tears . I have heard that each circus clown must register a face with the national clown organization , that they can not co-opt the faces of others . Maybe women should have to do that , women who are famous for stealing the full lips and long , curving eyebrows of teenage runway models ; perhaps women could be forced to be themselves , the way my sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming some days that I even fantasize about joining the circus , although anyone , including my sister and ex-husbands , will tell you that I am not funny . <p> The smallest man glances away from the showgirls and looks at me . He sways slightly , drunkenly , against the music . He whispers to the black man , sending him to the bar . The smallest man then jumps down , walks over to the showgirls , and disappears from my sight . <p> Martin brings another drink before I have finished the one in front of me . He nods over his shoulder and says , " The small guy sent this to you , says it 's for ' the most beautiful woman . ' " from him the compliment means something , and it means something to me that Martin conducted the message . " Have you been to the circus ? " Martin asks . <p> " I went tonight with my sister . That was my sister with me . " My arms , a bronze color that makes unclear precisely what my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some people assume I come from an island where all the women are beautiful . <p> " She looks like you , " Martin says . My hair is swept off my face , twisted softly at the back of my head so that my neck is bare . Martin 's gaze washes over me ; he never lets his eyes linger , perhaps out of respect or maybe because he does n't trust me , having seen me leave with dozens of men . Martin is about to lift his foot and place it on a shelf under the bar , which means he will lean toward me and say something privately . But the look-alike couple interrupts our moment by motioning to him . They want a bag of nuts . <p> Shrieks erupt from the showgirl table , and I do not see the smallest man , but soon the red-haired woman screams , " You little pervert midget ! " The smallest man emerges from under the table on all fours , brushes himself off , and returns to the jukebox . He holds a black platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare feet and grabs it from him . Her skirt is very short . The smallest man grins , but the two big men look anxious . <p> Though there is no table service on weeknights , Martin walks around the bar and brings the showgirls another round . The women must have been wearing wigs during the performance , because all of them have close-cropped hair . Their eyes are painted large . The redhead has long , muscular legs , the legs of an athlete , legs smooth and strong enough to turn a bartender into a waitress . Martin lets his gaze wander all over those legs , even after he returns to his post . These are probably the kind of women he prefers : energetic , acrobatic , clever . <p> One showgirl holds her fingers an inch apart toward the jukebox , and when the smallest man looks over , all the women burst out laughing . Their mouths seem large enough to swallow his whole head . When the red-haired showgirl notices me staring , she narrows her eyes . I turn back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They think I have cheated in order to look this way . Have I had surgery ? They wonder . They assume that , one way or another , I have sold my soul to the devil . <p> And I understand why the smallest man in the world ca n't leave them alone . For the same reason that I ca n't resist beautiful new men who come into this bar  --  because desiring them is uncomplicated . It is not the showgirls ' fault that the smallest man humiliates himself  --  their cruelty is ordinary , and they could not possibly know what it means to be tiny . <p> The showgirls were best during the halftime show , when all the animals and performers came out in a Wild West spectacular ; the showgirls wore fake-leather miniskirts with oversized pistols on their hips . ! should have told my sister how much I liked the halftime show . My sister was right  --  the girl riding that sweaty rhinoceros practically had to do the splits as she bounced on its wide , slippery back . <p> There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to county fairs for that kind of grotesquerie , or else watch television . This July I traveled thirty miles and paid two dollars each to see the world 's smallest horse , the fattest pig , the longest alligator . You must take for granted that they really are the longest , the smallest , and the fattest . Who is to say that the posted weight , height , or length is even honest ? Who is in charge of freak-show weights and measures ? <p> Surely the man who bought me this drink is the smallest man in the world ; the greatest show on earth would not lie so boldly . Before I finish my second , the smallest man has ordered his third . He seems drunk already , the way a regular-sized man would be had he taken three or four times as much . <p> On my way to the bathroom , I look straight ahead , avoiding the eyes of the red-haired showgirl , but on my way back , I walk slowly enough to study their heads and shoulders and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily , perhaps to disguise sweat . Though they portray beautiful women , they are not particularly beautiful . Real beauty would be too quiet on the arena floor , and it could not compete with the menagerie of elephants and horseback riders . Beauty can not transmit over long distances , could not possibly stretch into the upper tiers of a stadium ; costumes do a better job than the real thing . Helen 's beauty was transmitted by hearsay ; how many of those men who died at Troy ever saw her ? The showgirls are not as young and foolish as they seem in costume . They are actors and magicians , good with the sleight of hand , the sleight of face . <p> Even the smallest man in the world used a few tricks . When he appeared in the center ring at halftime , sitting and then standing on the seat of a circus-painted stagecoach , he wore a suit jacket that had been cut long so his legs , which are actually in perfect proportion to his body , looked short . The wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any human . <p> A crack like thunder sounds through the bar , but the showgirls do not look up . They are accustomed to elephants stampeding , vendors hawking , cannons blowing humans across arenas . <p> " Off the jukebox , " says the bartender . He says it quickly , directly , without sharpness , and he is already turning away to avoid a confrontation . Martin is a genius . The smallest man in the world has not taken offense . He holds out his arms , signaling to his friends that he wants to be carried . <p> A man in a dark suit approaches this end of the bar and catches my eye . He has not been in here before . He is perhaps twenty-five and has on his face a look of mild astonishment . If my attention were not elsewhere , I might nod and invite him to sit beside me . He leaves one empty stool between us and motions to the bartender . His jacket hangs from broad , straight shoulders ; the material is gray , tending toward blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the hotel desk , or later tonight in a hotel bed . <p> At the hotel , I mostly work behind a glass wall , filling out forms , designing staff schedules , and making phone calls , unless there is a problem . In that case , I walk on three-inch heels from behind the glass , and I say in the most elegant voice you can imagine , " Is there a problem ? " My mouth is perfectly darkened , and I do not open it again until the customer and the clerk have said all they want to say , and still I wait a little longer in silence . Only occasionally do I have to refund money . <p> Before I can speak to the man in the dark suit , the two men in coveralls carry the smallest man in the world to the bar . From here I can not tell if the jukebox glass is cracked . Now they are playing a very old heartbreak by Hank Williams Sr.  --  the circus people have been playing all country-western . <p> I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way I think about growing less beautiful . Perhaps he and I could live together , drink less , entertain in our home . I know how difficult it would be to really know the smallest man in the world , to see beyond his height , and I would work for us not to be strangers , Along the stairway to our bedroom , beside the studio shots of our children , would hang photos of our old deformed selves . Thirty-five is not too late to start a family . My second husband , who already had two daughters , said I was too selfish to be a mother  --  but I could change . My late-born children would have an easier time than his girls . When my girls looked at photos of me , they would say , " You were so beautiful , Mommy , " and that past tense would be much easier on them at thirteen than " You are so beautiful . " My husband would say , " I used to be the smallest man in the world until I met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I genuinely looked forward to growing plain , I should skip the facials , the weekly manicures , and the constant touchups for my auburn highlights ; I should let my hair hang in an easy style like my sister 's , or cut it short and convenient as the showgirls have done . Well , you may as well suggest to a tall man that he slump ; for me to neglect my beauty now would be a denial of the facts . <p> Though I try to ignore the stranger beside me , my body moves toward his the way a flower bends to the sun . I close my eyes in an attempt to resist , but when I open them he is looking into my face . He smells musky and a little smoky , and his eyes are cocktails with black olives . I would continue to slide closer , except that the smallest man in the world is making a fuss . He has jumped onto the bar and is standing with hands on hips , like the most outrageous , arrogant child in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " You 're going to have to get down , " says Martin . <p> The smallest man shouts in a language I have never heard in the hotel  --  Hungarian , perhaps . He is angry and hurt , but his two friends , black and white , continue to man the second and third corners of his triangle . They love him too much to encourage him to climb down . He is not a child , after all . He wears what look like a boy 's sneakers , but his pants are tailored , and his safari-style jacket is cut to his figure . He stands tall , enraptured in hostility toward the bartender , and I hope I do not have to choose sides . The showgirls have finally noticed , and they are watching too  --  everybody loves a spectacle . <p> The smallest man in the world turns and looks across the room , not at them but at me . " Beautiful lady ! " he shouts , in that accent . " Help me ! " He hands his highball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar toward me . The old woman with rouge clings to her drink at the other end . The smallest man leaps over most of the glasses between himself and me but knocks over both drinks of the pale look-alike couple . They lean back on their stools , a Siamese twin , both mouths limp in one expression of confusion . The man beside me jumps up and moves away . The smallest man in the world holds out his arms to me , and without hesitation I put down my drink and open my arms . With my beautiful but sad eyes I promise that if he reaches me , I will protect him . I will hold and shelter him like my own first child , embrace him as my blood brother , honor him as my true husband . I stand and step slightly back from the bar . If he is brave enough to jump , I will catch him . <p> <p> By BONNIE JO CAMPBELL <p>                   @ @
