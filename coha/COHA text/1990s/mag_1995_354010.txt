POLITICS ABHORS A VACUUM , AND Newt Gingrich last week was feeling its tug . Even before Senate majority leader Bob Dole 's uninspired performance during Wednesday 's televised forum in New Hampshire for G.O.P. presidential candidates , Gingrich had phoned key Republicans around the country and wondered aloud whether he should launch his own bid for the White House . Already on the previous Saturday , over dinner at the Connecticut home of Henry and Nancy Kissinger , Gingrich had fretted about Dole and launched into a detailed analysis of his own presidential chances . <P> Gingrich is clashing with two different Bob Doles . The Speaker ca n't control Dole the campaigner , but he needs to have influence over Dole the Senator in order to push through the extensive collection of spending cuts and tax reductions promised in the Contract with America . So last week the Speaker took control of the legislative stream , persuading Dole to create a task force of House and Senate leaders designed in part to ensure that the Senate majority leader and other moderate Senate Republicans would not unilaterally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of congressional bargaining . The Speaker also anointed himself the Hill 's master strategist and tactician . When the time came for Republicans to take a harder line toward Bill Clinton , it was Gingrich , not Dole , who set the tone . And when the time came to secure a powerful ally for the G.O.P. 's embattled overhaul of Medicare , it was Gingrich , not Dole , who cut the deal , by winning  --  some would say buying  --  the endorsement of the influential American Medical Association . <P> Gingrich 's message to Dole is simple : Follow me , or get out of the way . In leaking to allies his latest presidential ambitions , the Speaker sought to make it appear that what worries him is a presidential run by Colin Powell , since the general is an avowed moderate who might threaten the Speaker 's agenda . Of Powell 's candidacy , Gingrich spokesman Tony Blankley says , " As long as the Speaker is reasonably assured that whoever the standard bearer is going to be is willing and able to carry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very happy being Speaker . " <P> But those words are directed as much at Dole as at Powell . In public last week , Dole and Gingrich made unusually overt displays of cooperation  --  twice holding joint press conferences to castigate the White House for failing to negotiate in good faith . In private , hard feelings are hardening . Dole suggested two weeks ago on national television that Republicans might not be able to deliver all the $245 billion in tax cuts they have promised . The admission so infuriated Gingrich that he telephoned three prominent Republican Governors and told them , in effect , " I 've had it with this guy . " Although the Senate Finance Committee unveiled a proposal for the full tax cut last Friday , Gingrich knows as well as Dole that it is unlikely to survive negotiations with the White House . What Gingrich could n't believe was that Dole would show his cards in the middle of the poker game , thus panicking freshman Republican lawmakers and corporate interest groups .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
