Aretha Franklin 's forthcoming CD , A Rose Is Still a Rose , is the 55-year-old singer 's first album in seven years and her finest in two decades . Rose , due out March 10 , boasts an all-star squad of producers , including Sean ( " Puffy " ) Combs ( who 's worked with rapper the Notorious B.I.G. ) , Jermaine Dupri ( Mariah Carey , Usher ) , and Lauryn Hill ( of the hip-hop band the Fugees ) . Still , this is Aretha 's show . Numbers like the cardiotonic title track urge female self-esteem ; another song , the sweetly epiphanous ballad Love Pang , links the everyday chores of life to recollections of romance . Franklin talked with TIME in her hometown of Detroit . <P> TIME : Some fans might be surprised to hear the Queen of Soul singing hip-hop . <P> Franklin : I 'm a very versatile vocalist . That 's what I think a singer should be . Whatever it is , I can sing it . I 'm not a rock artist . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never Leave You Again on my album . It 's very jazzy , very cool , very easy . <P> TIME : You have n't given a full-length interview to TIME , or almost anybody else , in 30 years . You 're also working on a memoir with music writer David Ritz . Why are you speaking out now ? <P> Franklin : There have been a number , not a lot , of inaccuracies about my career , and me . I think it 's time to correct the record . One of the main things  --  and this happened with TIME in 1968 ... <P> TIME : Do n't blame me for that . I was only a year old in 1968 . <P> Franklin : You 're younger than me , then . Anyway  --  one of the worst things that was ever said in my career was that my mother had deserted my family . That simply is not true . My mother was a very respectable person . We were with her regularly , whenever she was supposed to be there . So that really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Why do you live in Detroit ? <P> Franklin : I like the camaraderie of the people . It 's a real community . I met Detroit Pistons basketball star Grant Hill once . I was outside the locker room after a game . I told someone to tell him Janet Jackson was outside . <P> TIME : Are there any singers out there who you think really represent the future ? <P> Franklin : Erykah Badu is a very good vocalist . I like her wit . She 's kind of a cross between Diana Ross and Billie Holiday . Mariah Carey has done some things I like . Her vocals and production have a very tight quality . <P> TIME : You work with some younger performers on this album . As a veteran , did you have any words of wisdom for , say , an up-and-comer like Lauryn Hill ? <P> Franklin : I was ripped off here and there when I was younger ... So I told Lauryn nobody is going to tell you anything in the recording industry . So you have to investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , managers , agents and such who have your best interests in mind . I also thought her generation should give our generation a big party  --  annually  --  because we put out so much information for them and they are capitalizing on it . <P> TIME : Your songs are often about painful relationships . Have your own relationships with men been painful ? <P> Franklin : I write a lot of songs . I do n't just sit around and write songs about pain ... I could go back today to any man I 've been with . I 'm friends with , or could be friends with , all of them . <P> TIME : Will you ever get married again ?
