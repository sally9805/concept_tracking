To investigate the hypothesis that sulpiride potentiates stereotyped locomotion at an intermediate dose of amphetamine , rats were assigned to one of four treatment groups ( n=7 per group ) : vehicle + saline ; 20 mg/kg sulpiride + saline ; vehicle + 3.5mg/kg amphetamine ; 20 mg/kg sulpiride + 3.5 mg/kg amphetamine . An automated tracking system was used to record distance moved and sequences of movements between quadrants in a circular open-field . The results showed that amphetamine increased horizontal distance moved , and increased the number and proportion of thigmotaxic trips around the perimeter of the apparatus . Sulpiride reduced amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and the number of perimeter trips . but had no effect on the proportion and maximum run length of perimeter trips . Thus sulpiride reduces the hyperactivity produced by an intermediate dose of amphetamine , but does not appear to affect the stereotyped nature of locomotion under the drug . <p> The clinical effects of antipsychotic drugs are thought to involve dopamine receptor blockade . Consequently , a popular technique for detecting novel antipsychotic agents involves assessing the ability of a compound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and amphetamine . Considerable attention has been focused on amphetamine-induced focused stereotyped behaviors such as sniffing , licking , and gnawing because these behaviors are reliably antagonized by classic antipsychotics such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine ( Szechtman , Eilam , Teitel'oaum , &; Golani , 1988 ) . However , it is now clear that a group of clinically effective drugs , so called " atypical " antipsychotics , do not antagonise all the components of amphetamine-induced stereotyped behavior . <p> A typical antipsychotics are not a homogeneous class of compounds . They show a wide spectrum of biochemical effects on dopaminergic mechanisms ( Tamminga &; Gerlach , 1987 ) , and they vary in their ability to antagonize specific amphetamine-induced stereotyped behaviors ( Tschanz &; Rebec , 1989 ) . Sulpiride is an atypical antipsychotic that shows an unusual spectrum of activity on the behavior of laboratory animals . It has been called a " silent neuroleptic " ( Worms &; Lloyd , 1979 ) because of its weak ability to antagonize stereotyped behavior produced by the dopamine agonist apomorphine . A paradoxical finding was reported by Robertson and MacDonald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stereotyped head movements and sniffing induced by 2.5 and 5 mg/kg amphetamine . Similar results were reported by Sharp , Zetterstrom , Ljungberg , and Ungerstedt ( 1986 ) who found that 50 mg/kg sulpiride prolonged the stereotyped head and forelimb movements produced by 2 mg/kg amphetamine . <p> The paradoxical effects of atypical antipsychotics on stereotyped behavior , and the observation that atypical antipsychotics are less likely to produce the Parkinsonian-like extrapyramidal side effects which are associated with classic antipsychotic drugs , has cast doubt on the utility of amphetamine antagonism as a screening technique for antipsychotic potential ( Robertson &; MacDonald , 1985 ; Tschanz &; Rebec , 1989 ) , and led to the suggestion that antagonism of amphetamine-induced stereotypy predicts a compound 's potential to induce unwanted extrapyramidal side effects in humans ( Ljungberg &; Ungerstedt , 1985 ) . Recently it has been argued that the shared ability of classic and atypical neuroleptics to reduce amphetamine-induced hyperactivity may form the basis of a more satisfactory test of antipsychotic potential ( Ljungberg &; Ungerstedt , 1985 ; Rebec &; Bashore , 1984 ) . <p> Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locomotion ( Fishman , Feigenbaum , Yanai , &; Klawans , 1983 ) , noradrenergic and serotinergic systems may play a role in determining the spatial distribution of locomotion within an open field ( Geyer , Masten , &; Segal , 1986 ) . <p> Traditionally , a distinction has been drawn between amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and focused stereotyped behaviors elicited by the drug ( Szechtman et al. , 1988 ) . However , several authors have argued that amphetamine-induced forward locomotion has stereotyped properties . For example , amphetamine-treated rats often repeat a particular route through the apparatus ( Schiorring , 1979 ; Mueller , Hollingsworth , &; Cross , 1989a ; Mueller , Kunko , Whiteside , &; Haskett , 1989b ) . Mueller et al . ( 1989a ) introduced the term " trip length " to describe the qualitative nature of this type of locomotion under amphetamine . A trip is terminated when the animal changes direction or completes a tour of the perimeter of the apparatus . A length 4 trip involves the rat entering each corner of an open-held in turn before returning to the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scored when the animal moves from one corner to an adjacent corner . It is important to emphasize that the length 4 trips studied by these authors are distinct from " pivoting " which involves the animal revolving in tight circles without walking forward ( Teitebaum , Pellis , &; DeVietti , 1990 ) . <p> In order to quantify the repetitive and invariant ( stereotyped ) nature of locomotion under amphetamine , Mueller et al . ( 1989a ) devised a statistic , gamma , which is the probability that an animal will repeat the trip length that it has just completed . Gamma can be thought of as a measure of the " sameness " within a series of trips . Unfortunately gamma does not vary in a straightforward dose dependent fashion ; Mueller et al ( 1989b ) found that gamma was significantly greater under 2mg/kg amphetamine than under saline , but did not increase further under higher doses of the drug . Moreover , in an earlier paper , they reported that low doses of amphetamine ( 0.75-2.25 mg/kg ) had no effect on gamma ( Mueller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vary in a more reliable dose dependent manner under amphetamine . Under saline and low doses of the drug ( 1 to 2 mg/kg ) the majority of trips are of length 1 ; length 4 trips are exhibited under higher doses of amphetamine ( Mueller et ah 1989a ) . This thigmotaxic patrolling of an open-field boundary can be exhibited in a stereotyped fashion ; Mueller et al . ( 1989b ) reported that under 3 and 4mg/kg amphetamine " A subset of rats repeated trips of " 4 " exclusively " ( p 505 ) , but unfortunately no details of the number of repeated trips were given . Nevertheless , the repetitive and invariant nature of this behavior suggests that at certain doses amphetamine-induced locomotion is stereotyped . Perimeter circling is not simply an expression of increased activity ; caffeine and low doses of amphetamine ( 0.75 to 2.25 mg/kg ) increase locomotion , but do not increase the proportion of length 4 trips ( Mueller et al. , 1989a ) . <p> In view of reports that sulpiride potentiates amphetamine-induced focused stereotypies ( Robertson &; MacDonald , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effects of sulpiride on amphetamine-induced stereotyped locomotion as measured by changes in gamma , and the proportion and run length of perimeter trips . METHOD <p> Animals <p> Twenty-eight male ( 370-450g ) Wistar rats , the descendants of stock supplied by Olac , Bicester , Oxon , were used . Animals were housed in groups of four with free access to food and water . Clock controlled lights were on from 0600 to 1800 hours and room temperature was maintained at 22 + - 3 degrees C. Testing was carried out between 1000 and 1700 hours under dim red light . <p> Apparatus <p> A circular open field ( 75-cm diameter , height 30 cm ) constructed from black perspex was used . A closed circuit TV camera ( Hitachi model HV-62S with SGI HF9A lens ) was mounted approximately 170 cm above the floor of the field . In a separate room the camera picture was analysed by an HVS Image Systems V unit which converted the video signal into a stream of XY coordinate pairs representing the position of the animal ( Renner , Pierre , &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was relayed to an Opus PCV microcomputer which sampled 3 XY coordinate pairs per second . The subject 's pattern of movement was analyzed using software , described in detail elsewhere ( Kenyon , 1990a ) , which was modified to accept input from the V unit . <p> Drug treatments <p> Animals were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups ( n=7 per group ) : vehicle + saline ( VEH-SAL ) ; 20 mg/kg sulpiride + saline ( SUL-SAL ) ; vehicle + 3.5 mg/kg amphetamine ( VEH-AMP ) ; 20 mg/kg sulpiride + 3.5 mg/kg amphetamine ( SUL-AMP ) . D-amphetamine sulphate ( Sigma , UK ) was dissolved in 0.9% physiological saline and administered IP in a volume of I ml/kg . Sulpiride ( Sigma , UK ) was dissolved in 1% lactic acid ( vehicle ) and administered SC in a volume of 1 ml/kg . <p> Behavioral Observation <p> Each subject was exposed to the open held for 30 min approximately 24 hours prior to drug treatment . The next day they were injected with sulpiride or vehicle and placed in the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apparatus , injected with amphetamine or saline , and replaced immediately in the center of the open field where they remained for the 105 min test session . The apparatus was washed between subjects each day . <p> Data collection and analysis <p> During the 105-min test session the output from the camera and the HVS image analyzer was monitored on a TV screen . The path taken by the subject was displayed on the computer screen by the TRACKER software . The screen showed a representation of the floor of the open field subdivided by lines into four equal sized areas . The software tracked the animals ' movements between these quadrants . <p> At the end of each session a printout was produced showing distance moved ( in cm ) during 5-min time intervals . These data were subjected to a two-we , repeated measures ( drug treatment x interval ) ANOVA . The printout also contained details of each subject 's sequence of movements between adjacent areas of the open-field . The sequence was subdivided into a series of trips ( Mueller et al. , 1989a ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1990b ) . A single trip consists of a sequence of movements between adjacent quadrants of the open field . A trip is terminated when the rat changes direction , or completes a tour of the perimeter of the apparatus . Trip length is defined as the number of regions entered ( lines crossed ) during a trip . Trip length can take values of 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 in an open field divided into four regions . A trip between quadrants that are diagonally opposite each other is scored as length 1 and recorded as a " center " trip . The effect of drug treatment on the number of length 4 trips was assessed with two-way repeated measures ( drug treatment x interval ) ANOVA . The proportion of trip lengths was calculated for 15-min time periods of the 105-min session . Arcsin transformations were performed on the trip proportion values before statistical analysis ( Winer , 1971 ) . The proportions of trip lengths 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 sum to 1.0 and therefore trips of length 3 were discarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each drug treatment group were analyzed by separate two-way repeated measures ANOVA ( trip length x interval ) for each drug treatment condition . The proportion of length 4 trips made by the SULAMP and VEH-AMP groups was compared with a two-way repeated measures ( drug treatment x interval ) ANOVA . <p> Two successive trips of the same length were scored as a repeat trip . Two successive trips of different length were scored as a change trip . Gamma is defined as the number of repeat trips divided by the number of repeat trips plus the number of change trips ( Mueller et al. , 1989a ) . Gamma scores were calculated for 15-min time intervals and compared with a two-way repeated measures ANOVA ( drug treatment x interval ) . <p> All post-hoc comparisons were made using the Tukey HSD test ; p &lt; .05 was used as the criterion for statistical significance . RESULTS <p> Distance moved <p> Distance moved was significantly affected by drug treatment across the session ( F ( 3,24 ) = 16.20 ; p &lt; .001 ) . Figure 1 shows that 3.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VEH-SAL vs VEH-AMP ; p &lt; .0l , Tukey 's HSD ) . Sulpiride tended to reduce the distance moved ( mean SUL-SAL = 485m ; mean VEH-SAL = 754 m ) but this effect was not significant across the session . Horizontal movement was significantly increased by amphetamine in rats pretreated with sulpiride ( SUL-SAL vs . SUL-AMP ; p &lt; .05 ) . However 20 mg/kg sulpiride significantly reduced the effect of amphetamine on distance moved ( SUL-AMP vs . VEH-AMP ; p &lt; .01 ) . There was a significant interaction between drug treatment and session interval ( E ( 60,480 ) = 3.53 ; p &lt; .0001 ) . Examination of Figure I shows that sulpiride did not antagonize the effect of amphetamine during the first 30 min but reduced the peak of hyperactivity 40-45 min after amphetamine , and reduced the duration of the effect of amphetamine on distance moved . <p> Number of length 4 trips <p> The time course of the effect of amphetamine on the number of complete trips around the periphery of the open-field ( length 4 trips ) is shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly affected by drug treatment across the session ( F ( 3,24 ) = 9.69 ; p &lt; .001 ) . Saline treated rats made relatively few trips around the perimeter of the open-field ( mean VEH-SAL = 0.24 , mean SUL-SAL = 0.19 ) . Amphetamine increased the number of length 4 trips ( VEH-SAL vs . VEH-AMP ; p &lt; .01 , Tukey 's HSD ) . Sulpiride pretreatment significantly reduced the number of length 4 trips in amphetamine treated rats ( SUL-AMP vs . VEH-AMP ; p &lt; .05 ) . There was a significant interaction between drug treatment and session time ( F ( 60,480 ) = 2.89 ; p &lt; .001 ) . Figure 2 shows that sulpiride reduced the peak intensity and duration of amphetamine-induced trips around the apparatus . Comparison of treatments at 20 , 40 , and 60 min revealed significant differences between VEH-AMP and VEH-SAL groups at 40 ( p &lt; .01 ) and 60 min ( p &lt; .01 ) . The SUL-SAL and SUL-AMP groups were significantly different at 40 min only . The SUL-AMP and VEH-AMP did not differ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amphetamine at 40 ( p &lt; .01 ) and 60 min ( p &lt;.05 ) . <p> Animals treated with amphetamine exhibited several unbroken runs of repeated trips around the field perimeter . The maximum number of times that an animal repeatedly moved right around the apparatus without changing its direction of movement showed considerable variability within groups . Nevertheless , the maximum run length was significantly greater in the VEH-AMP group ( mean=12.4 ; SE=3.9 ; range 3-30 ) than the VEH-SAL ( mean=1.2 ; SE=0.2 ; range -2 ) group ( p &lt; .05 ) . Pretreatment with sulpiride did not significantly reduce the maximum run length of type 4 trips under amphetamine ( SUL-AMP , mean=7.6 ; SE=3.2 ; range 2-21 ) . <p> Proportion of trip lengths <p> The proportion of trip lengths 1 , 2 , and 4 under each treatment as well as the percentage of subjects that remained immobile during 15-min intervals , are shown in Figure 3a-d . <p> Vehicle-Saline ( VEH-SAL ) <p> Figure 3a shows that the majority of trips made by rats in the VEH-SAL group were of length 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .001 ) . There was no significant variation in trip type across the session . There were significantly more length I than length 4 ( p &lt; .01 ) and length 2 trips ( p &lt; .01 ) . There was no significant difference in the proportion of length I and length 2 trips under this treatment . <p> Sulpiride-Saline ( SUL-SAL ) <p> A number of rats treated with sulpiride were immobile during the second half of the session ( Figure 3b ) . Therefore , the subsequent analysis was restricted to the first 45 min of the session . Rats treated with 20 mg/kg sulpiride showed a preponderance of length 1 trips ( F ( 2,12 ) = 36.98 ; p &lt; .001 ) , and there was no significant variation in trip type across the session . There were significantly more length 1 than length 4 ( p &lt;.01 ) and length 2 trips ( p &lt; .01 ) . There was no significant difference in the proportion of length 4 and length 2 trips under sulpiride . <p> Vehicle-Amphetamine ( VEH-AMP ) <p> Figure 3c shows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengths as a function of time interval across the session ( F ( 12,72 ) = 7.25 ; p &lt; .001 ) . There was a significantly greater proportion of length 1 trips than length 4 or length 2 trips during the first ( 0-15 mini p &lt; .05 ) and last ( 90-105mini p &lt; .05 ) intervals . The proportion of length 1 trips declined , and the proportion of length 4 trips increased , during the session , so that there were no significant differences between the proportions of trip types at any 15 min interval from 15-90 min . <p> Sulpiride-Amphetamine ( SUL-AMP ) <p> A number of rats treated with sulpiride and amphetamine were immobile during the last 45 min of the session ( Figure 3d ) . Therefore , the subsequent analysis was restricted to the first 60 min of the session . In sulpiride pretreated rats , amphetamine produced a significant change in the proportions of trip lengths as a function of time interval across the session ( F ( 6,36 ) = 3.63 ; p &lt; .0064 ) . There was a significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length 2 trips at intervals 0-15 min ( p 's &lt; .01 ) , 15-30 min ( p 's &lt; .05 ) , and 45 60 min ( p 's &lt; .01 ) . Figure 3d shows that the proportion of length 1 trips declined and the proportion of length 4 trips increased at 30-45 min . There were no significant differences between trip proportions at this interval . <p> Examination of Figure 3c and 3d suggests that the proportion of length 4 trips was similar in the VEH-AMP and SUL-AMP groups . A separate two-way ANOVA with interval as the repeated measure confirmed that during the first 60 min of the session the proportion of length 4 trips was not affected by 20 mg/kg sulpiride in animals treated with 3.5 mg/kg amphetamine ( F ( 1,12 ) = 1.35 ; p &lt; .27 ) . <p> Gamma <p> A number of rats in the SUL-SAL group were immobile during the second half of the session ( Figure 3b ) . Therefore , the subsequent analysis was restricted to the first 45 min of the session . The effects of amphetamine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistic are shown in Figure 4 . Values of gamma can range from 0 , indicating the absence of stereotypy ( no repetition of any trip length ) , to I which indicates that a particular trip length was repeated exclusively of all other trip lengths ( maximal stereotypy ) . Figure 4 suggests that amphetamine reduced stereotyped locomotion ( VEH-AMP ) , and that this effect is not modified by sulpiride pretreatment ( SUL-AMP ) . In contrast , rats treated with saline ( VEH-SAL and SUL-SAL groups ) obtained high gamma scores . Analysis of the significant interaction between drug treatment and time interval ( E ( 6,48 ) = 3.74 ; p &lt; .01 ) confirmed the unexpected finding that amphetamine significantly reduced scores on this measure of locomotor stereotypy ( VEH-SAL vs VEH-AMP ; p &lt; .05 ) . The gamma statistic is essentially a measure of the " sameness " between trip lengths . Examination of trip sequences revealed that rats in the VEH-SAL and SUL-SAL groups made repeated length I trips with relatively few change trips and consequently obtained high gamma scores . Gamma scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip sequences contained more changes between length I and length 4 trips . DISCUSSION <p> In agreement with previous findings , 3.5 mg/kg amphetamine increased open field locomotion , as well as the number and proportion , of length 4 trips around the periphery of an open field ( Mueller et al. , 1989a , 1989b ) . Pretreatment with 20 mg/kg sulpiride reduced amphetamine-induced locomotion . This finding is consistent with previous reports that sulpiride reduces the hyperactivity produced by intermediate doses of amphetamine ( Ljungberg &; Ungerstedt , 1985 ; Sharp et al. , 1986 ) . Also sulpiride reduced the number of perimeter trips made under amphetamine . This effect is perhaps not surprising because sulpiride reduced the amount of forward locomotion under the drug . <p> The most intriguing finding in the present study was that even though sulpiride reduced horizontal activity and the number of complete perimeter trips , sulpiride did not reduce the proportion of length 4 trips during the period of greatest hyperactivity induced by amphetamine ( 0-60 min postinjection ) . Furthermore sulpiride did not reduce the maximum run length of repeated circular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this measure . These findings suggest that the stereotyped nature of locomotion produced by amphetamine is not antagonized by this dose of sulpiride . Of course , at higher doses , sulpiride is likely to reduce locomotion to such an extent that stereotyped locomotion would also disappear . <p> A number of rats injected with sulpiride ( SUL-SAL and SUL-AMP groups ) did not move between the quadrants of the apparatus during the last hour of the test session . Visual observation of these immobile subjects revealed that rats injected with sulpiride ( SUL-SAL ) were standing still or lying down during this period . In contrast , subjects that became immobile following treatment with sulpiride and amphetamine engaged in continuous head movements that were directed at the junction between the wall and floor of the apparatus . <p> A principal aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that sulpiride would potentiate amphetamine-induced stereotyped locomotion . The intermediate dose of amphetamine used in this study ( 3.5 mg/kg ) was selected because it provides a suitable baseline for detecting either facilitatory or inhibitory effects of sulpiride on stereotyped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported that approximately 40% of trips were length 4 in the period 20-40 min after 3 mg/kg amphetamine . Similar changes in the proportion of trip types 1 and 4 were found in the present study . Nevertheless , we could find no evidence that sulpiride increases those aspects of locomotion that are exhibited in a stereotyped manner under 3.5 mg/kg amphetamine . Thus , 20 mg/kg sulpiride did not increase either the proportion of length 4 trips , or the run length of repeated length 4 trips . This lack of effect of sulpiride on stereotyped locomotion contrasts with previous findings that the drug potentiates amphetamine-induced stereotyped head movements and sniffing ( Robertson &; MacDonald , 1985 ) . It is unlikely that sulpiride 's failure to potentiate stereotyped locomotion was due to procedural factors such as : the length of time between sulpiride and amphetamine injections , sulpiride dose , or route of administration because this study , and that conducted by Robertson and MacDonald ( 1985 ) injected 20 mg/kg SC 30 min before amphetamine . <p> The observation that amphetamine-induced stereotyped locomotion was not disrupted by sulpiride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block selective components of amphetamine-induced stereotypy ( Tschanz &; Rebec , 1989 ) , and reinforces the view that drug-induced stereotypy should not be thought of as a single behavioral response ( Rebec &; Bashore , 1984 ) . <p> Sulpiride has been called a " silent neuroleptic " because of its weak ability to antagonize apomorphine-induced stereotyped behavior ( Worms &; Lloyd , 1979 ) . A similar analogy helps to express our main finding . Sulpiride appears to act like the volume control on a radio . The drug reduces the loudness ' of a piece of music but the melody , ' which is made up of changing proportions of trip lengths , can still be heard . <p> Our results highlight how difficult it is to quantify stereotyped locomotion . According to Mueller et al . ' s ( 1989a ) gamma statistic , amphetamine significantly reduced stereotyped locomotion in the present study . However , closer examination of the changing proportions of length 1 and length 4 trips under the drug suggests that this result was due to the way gamma is calculated rather than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of sameness ' in a sequence of trips . Thus , an animal that repeats length I trips receives exactly the same gamma score as another animal which repeats the same number of length 4 trips . Mueller et al . ( 1989b ) reported that under saline typical gamma scores were 0.17 ; approximately 19% of trips were length 4 and 33% of trips were length 1 . However , in the present study , length 4 trips were rarely made under saline ( VEH-SAL and SUL-SAL groups ) ; the majority of trips were length 1 in these groups and consequently these animals obtained high gamma scores . <p> There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy . The present study used a circular open-field whereas the apparatus used by Muller et al . ( 1989ab ) was square . We are currently investigating the effect of open-field shape on stereotyped locomotion . <p> Habituation procedures differ between the studies . In the present study each subject was placed in the open field for 30 min on two separate occasions before data collection began . In contrast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately prior to testing . Mueller 's group is currently investigating the effect of habituation on the gamma index ( Mueller et al. , 1989b ) . Finally , the timing of washing the apparatus also differs between the studies . We washed the apparatus before each habituation trial whereas Mueller et al. , ( 19896 ) washed the apparatus after the habituation period , while the subject was being injected . Thus , in the present study the presence of subject-generated odors , and the longer period of habituation , may have reduced exploration during the test session , particularly in saline injected subjects . <p> We found that gamma scores actually declined under 3.5 mg/kg amphetamine . This was associated with a reduction in the proportion of length 1 trips , and an increased proportion of length 4 trips . Close examination of Mueller et al . ' s ( 1989b ) report reveals similar effects of the drug in their animals . For instance , they reported a statistically significant decline in gamma scores following 3.5 mg/kg amphetamine . Figure 6 in Mueller et al . ( 1989b @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reduction in the proportion of length 1 trips and an increase in the proportion of length 4 trips . Furthermore , this interaction between trip type with time after injection was significant . This finding is very similar to our observations on the changing proportions of length 1 and 4 trips after amphetamine . In their discussion , the authors point out that " Locomotor stereotypy was usually accompanied by repetitions of trips of ' 1 ' . " ( Mueller et al. , 1989b , p. 505 ) . Stereotypy , as measured by gamma , actually declined in both studies with the emergence of length 4 trips . <p> Clearly further work is needed to develop a measure of stereotypy that takes account of the particular change in locomotion under amphetamine , which is manifested as an increase in patrolling around the perimeter of the apparatus . One possible route to explore is the temporal characteristics of this behavior . If the behavior is stereotyped then there should be a reduction in the coefficient of variation of the times taken to complete perimeter tours under the drug . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coefficient of variation measures to explore regularities in the spatial and temporal aspects of open field behavior under amphetamine . In addition , more research is needed to clarify the conditions under which atypical neuroleptic drugs reduce locomotion in amphetamine treated rats particularly if this technique is to be used as a screening test for novel antipsychotic drugs with low incidences of extrapyramidal side effects . <p>
