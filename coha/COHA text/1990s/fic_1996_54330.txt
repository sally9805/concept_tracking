When Michael Martin wrote " Spelunking at the Cavern , " he was living in San Francisco , traveling up and down the West Coast selling Marvel Comics to the direct-market comic book specialty stores . He was hired away by Dark Horse Comics in Portland , Oregon  --  and during the transition ( quite literally ) , he learned of his first short fiction sale . He notes that he owes Harlan Ellison a great debt of appreciation for all of his support . <p> It is n't every day that you run into yourself . The first time it happened to me , I was standing outside , a noisy dive on Mathew Street in the gray heart of the dockside warehouse district m Liverpool . I 'd been inside the club only once and already did not particularly want to go back . The din was frightening , and the place lacked even the most rudimentary air conditioning . The sweat of the leather-clad multitudes packed inside ran in dank rivulets down the walls . I had n't come all the way back to 1958 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , the nature of my mission made visiting this place a sorry necessity . <p> The Critical Incident , the event that would change my subject 's life forever , was n't due to happen until next Tuesday evening and it was now Saturday afternoon . I decided to use the time to reconnoiter , maybe do a little research and reading at the local library , maybe take some photos . But the first priority was to take in a meal . <p> Across Mathew Street from the Cavern Club lay an old-fashioned British fish-and-chips and beer pub of the sort that had flourished nearly two centuries ago , which is to say now . The light was dim in the comers of the tiny place , and the upholstery was old . The place stank of stale grease , but none of the other dozen or so patrons seemed to notice . I took a booth near the back and had just picked up a menu when I locked eyes with the man I least expected to see . He saw me , too , and came over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , regarding the face that stared back at me each morning from the shaving mirror . He did , and thanked me . <p> " What brings you to mid-twencen ? " he asked . <p> " Same thing as you , I guess , " I said . " Temporal trails . Evidence of time-tampering . You 're here , after all . Maybe that 's reason enough . " <p> " And I thought I was drawn here by all that stomping they 're doing right now over at the Cavern Club , " my doppelganger said with a chuckle . " Are you here from Alternitech , too ? " <p> I nodded . " Publishing Division . " <p> A buxom sandy-haired barmaid laid two pints of Guinness before us . I did n't remember ordering anything . He took a long quaff while I regarded my mug more reticently . I suppose on some of the time-lines of the multiverse , I 'm quite a tippler . <p> Wiping the foam from his lips , he said , " I work on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A &; R. " <p> I must have looked stupid , because he added , after a moment , " that means ' Artists and Repertoire . ' " <p> I frowned at the condescension . Sometimes I could really piss me off . " You do n't suppose , " I said , " that we could both have been sent here from our respective timelines to safeguard the same subject ? " <p> " I do n't know , " he said . " Let 's compare notes . " <p> I reached into the valise I always carried on my time-jaunts and withdrew several paperback books . Old , familiar childhood classics , really . Novels of imaginative fiction with titles like The Walrus Men , The Sun Kings , and All Shine On and anthologies with titles like Walls and Bridges of the Imagination and War Is Over ( with Jerry pournelle , with a reprint of the original Stuart Sutcliffe cover ) . My counterpart picked up a book , casually at first , until he recognized the name on the spine . His face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . He flipped through all of them , pausing here and there to actually read some of the prose . An attitude of seeming reverence crossed his features as he read . <p> " I 'll be damned , " he finally said . " I did n't know he had this in him . I mean , on my timeline he wrote a couple of books of Lewis Carroll-inspired nonsense , but never a coherent , sustained narrative like this ! " <p> " What did he do on your timeline instead ? " I asked , finally pausing for a moment to pay proper attention to my beer . " The Altemitech you work for must have valued it as much as my Alternitech values his contributions to the science fiction field . " <p> My alter ego drained his mug and gazed into the uneven rafters as he composed his answer . " In the word of Dr. Winston O'Boogie , ' you shoulda been there . ' " <p> " Meaning what ? " I asked , leaving some money on the table . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little club across the street and I 'll show you . " <p> The Cavern Club was just as noisy , sweaty , crowded and close as it had been during my first cursory reconnaissance visit . The place was stuffed with gum-chewing teenagers , leather-clad teddy boys and natty suit-and-tie lunch-crowd types . The stage had just been vacated by what the locals called a " skiffle " band ( guitar , bass , and tea chest ) as we made our way to a conveniently vacant table near the front . To get a table so near the stage in this crowd , my counterpart must have had some pull with somebody . The band , a scruffy , antisocial-looking lot , was swiftly replaced by another just as we took our rickety/wooden seats . <p> All five of the musicians in the new band were clad in black leather pants and western shirts with string ties . The drummer was a brooding James Dean type , his hair thrown up into a huge pompadour , his expression a narcissistic , brooding pout . Agawky , incredibly young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beside him stood a slight , intense young man in shades , a bass guitar nearly as massive as himself slung across his slight shoulders . At the opposite side of the stage stood a young man with a backward-strung guitar , an Elvis haircut , and the big puppy eyes of a Japanese cartoon character . And center stage , right before the stage 's single microphone stood the man whose life I was here to guide , the man whose career and eventual literary output I was here to safeguard . <p> My Subject , a man I 'd only seen in holos and book-jacket photographs , stood staring down the crowd , arrogantly myopic . I knew he could n't see anything without his glasses . I also knew that he was renowned for hating crowds . Maybe not being able to see them made them easier to face . My Subject lifted a black and white Rickenbacker guitar and slung it onto his body , holding it low , looking dangerous . <p> He counted fast to four and the band began a loud , discordant rendition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( remember , I never followed such stuff , at least not on my timeline ) . He sang or screamed rather , about twisting and shouting and shaking it on out , to an ebullient chorus of du-wops from the too-young guitarist and the big-eyed kid . The audience drank and stomped and danced and hooted and fought . They repeated this response even more vehemently during the second number , whose lyrics consisted largely of a greed-soaked litany of " Money , that 's what I want . " <p> I was confused . Sure , my Subject had dabbled in this stuff , this " rock ' n ' roll " , nonsense , during his art school period , but not for very long . This certainly was n't what history would one day immortalize him for . Rock ' n ' roll would be a mere footnote in his career , really . A curiosity . At least that 's the way it would play on my timeline . <p> I had to find out more . I noticed that my counterpart had lost himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Fender amplifiers , but there were questions I needed answered . I grabbed him by the arm and put my face next to his ear . <p> " I ca n't hear myself think m here ! " <p> I dragged him through to the door , weaving like a bee dancing the location of a cache of pollen , and maneuvered us through the spastic crowds . In the street , and around the corner , I spun my counterpart about to face me . <p> " Your John Lennon is a rock star ? " I asked incredulously . <p> Dusk lay over the English seaport town like a thin , cold blanket . My Other and I found ourselves in a small booth in yet another dockside pub . Two live pints of Guinness , amid several dead soldiers , lay on the table between us . By now we 'd decided to trust each other enough to exchange our palmtop computers as we exchanged stories and agendas . After fifteen minutes or so of this , I handed his palmtop back to him and he returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I slurred , " that after Lennon 's mother dies he becomes embittered and devotes himself entirely to this . . . music . " <p> " That 's right , " he said , lighting a cigarette . I wished he 'd quit that . " He was never the same after Julia Stanley was taken from him . " <p> " On my timeline , " I said , " she nearly outlived him . And Lennon himself lived to a ripe old age . How long does he live on your timeline ? " <p> " He 'll be shot to death just after turning forty , " he said sadly . " A crazed fan . " <p> I shook my head . " He 'd be a lot better off on my timeline . " <p> He sloshed his mug absently , the cigarette dangling from his lip . " So we not only have the same Subject to protect , but the same Critical Incident to oversee . " <p> " Then we have a huge problem , " I said . " Julia Stanley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her on Tuesday , July 15 , 1958 . Otherwise , my Subject will never have the opportunity to write all the books he 's responsible for back on my timeline . " <p> " On Tuesday night a drunken off-duty cop is going to drive down her street just a little too fast , " he said deliberately , meeting my eyes and holding my gaze as though trying to make his sincerity absolutely convincing . " She 's going to be walking home that night from her sister 's house . The cop wo n't see her , and she 'll be killed . If you change that , Lennon 's adolescence will cascade into completely different and unrecognizable channels . " <p> " I recognize them , " I said belligerently . <p> " The world will never hear about a rock band called the Beatles . " <p> I shrugged . I could see that this meant a great deal to him . But stacked next to Lennon 's literary output on my timeline the events my counterpart described on his seemed rather frivolous . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Silver Beetles , or whatever the hell those noisy , posing thugs had called themselves . On the other hand , my Other had never had the pleasure of reading The Sun Kings . It made sense that he would be as resolute as I was , given his experience . And given the fact that the man across the table from me was me . <p> " Your Alternitech , " he said , " must have an Emergency Procedures Manual just like mine does . " <p> " It does , " I said . <p> He quoted : " ' In the event of an encounter with another agent from a parallel reality or at temporal cross-purposes with your mission , that agent is to be considered a shoot-on-sight enemy . ' " <p> " I 'm supposed to kill you , too , " I confessed levelly , studying him , noting that he carefully kept his hands visible atop the table . <p> He chuckled . " If the Everettists up in Theoretical are right , then that order I quoted is pretty paranoid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep your reality from wiping out mine . I have to snuff you so the wave-function will collapse in my favor . " <p> I shook my head . " That 's pure Schrodinger . Your Everett-followers should believe , " I said , keeping my hands on top of the table , " that both our realities lie side-by-side , neither one a threat to the other . " <p> " We 're both here from the future , are n't we ? " <p> " Different futures , " I said . <p> " Same present , " he said , smiling . <p> " If Everett was right , there is n't a problem , " I said . " If Schrodinger was right , one of us is going to lose the coin-flip . It 's one hell of a gamble to stake an entire reality on . " <p> " I did n't say I accepted the bet , " he said , his smile falling . " I do n't need to know the answer that badly . " <p> " The Everettists did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Schrodingerites did . The wave-function is going to have to collapse one way or the other . " <p> He was suddenly all business . " Maybe you can shoot some faceless agent from another timeline . But can you shoot yourself. ? " <p> I stared into my beer and said nothing . I noticed that his hands were still on top of the table . <p> " I did n't think so , " he said . " But put that issue to one side for a few hours . Why not explore this timeline a bit more before doing anything irrevocable ? <p> I shook my head slowly . We were at an impasse . So for the fourth time that afternoon , I drained my mug , throwing my head back to catch all the foam . Drinking a Guinness was like eating a small loaf of very tart bread . As I put the mug down , I noticed the figure standing near the door . A man in a hat and trench coat . Staring . How long had he been there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chewed on a toothpick nervously , casting furtive glances toward our booth . He looked familiar , too , but with the hat obscuring his features , I could n't place him . I nodded in the direction of the man in the coat to point him out to my drinking companion , who abruptly turned to take a look at him . That must have spooked Trench , since he jerked into motion just then and strode quickly for the door . <p> One thing a veteran clandestine time-traveler finds annoying is being noticed . Being observed and stared at makes me feel positively undressed . Evidently , my drinking buddy felt the same way and the two of us decided without the need to exchange any words not to let Trench get very far away from us . <p> Once outside on the street neither of us could see which way he 'd gone . But I knew he could n't have gotten far . I pointed to the south end of the grubby asphalt lane and began to run in the opposite direction . My Other took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up should make our man easier to find , I reasoned . My Other and I could settle our differences later . <p> Turning the corner and running into a trash-strewn alley , I literally ran into Trench , practically knocking him down . He lurched onto one knee and as he struggled , to right himself I saw the little black gun in his hand . He leveled it straight at me and began to rise to both feet . For a single , frozen instant his eyes locked with mine and once again I had that eerie sensation of staring into the mirror . <p> The pistol jerked with a muffled pop and my forehead seared from the heat of the muzzle flash . At the same time , my trench coated doppelganger took another bad step , the flap of his coat having somehow gotten underfoot . I seized the wrist of his gun-hand and with a woosh of deflating lungs we sprawled in a flailing heap onto the alley 's smelly cobbles . <p> He tried to knee me in the groin , but I swiveled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forearm , trying to get him to open his hand . Needless to say , we were fairly evenly matched . <p> Then the gun gave another silenced , jerking report . <p> Sweaty , scraped , and shaken , I retraced my steps through the alley to the front of the pub . My slacks were tom at the knee , the pantleg slick with blood . Several sailors and rough-looking dock-worker types passed-me at the front door , but nobody favored me with so much as a glance . Street brawls were evidently as common here as the gum wrappers and bottles and cigarette butts lining the gutters . <p> " What the hell happened to you " asked my Beatle-fan alter ego , from behind me . I spun about to face him . I could n't stop shaking . <p> " I very nearly got killed by a not her one of you . Another one of me , I mean . Where the hell were you just then ? " I started to laugh at the absurdity of it . Could I have counted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd just now gotten killed in the alley , would n't his mission suddenly have gotten a whole lot less complicated ? <p> " Did you kill him ? " he asked soberly . I nodded . <p> My Other closed his eyes as though in silent prayer . Was he , too , imagining the horror of having to kill one 's self ? " What a thing to have to do , " he said at length . <p> " I saved you the trouble , " I said , maybe a little too harshly . I dug into a jacket pocket and withdrew the palmtop computer I took from my dead Other 's body . <p> My living Other seemed to rouse himself all at once , putting aside his horror . " We still have our original difficulty , " he said . " I am here to protect and preserve the timeline which produced John Winston Oho Lennon , the leader and founder of the Beatles . " <p> I touched a few keys on the palmtop , watching the screen as the machine booted up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coolly , " on behalf of John Winston Gemsback Lennon , one of the greatest New Wave science fiction writers who ever lived . " <p> " It 's one or the other , " he said . " Simple . " <p> Scrolling through a file on the palmtop , my spine recoiled as though charged with freon . I wondered absurdly if someone were walking across my grave . <p> " No , " I said . " It 's not simple . " <p> " What ? " <p> " Who first invented the timefield generator ? " I asked . <p> My Other shrugged . " Who knows ? Once it was invented , it must have spread into everywhere and everywhere . I 'm sure there are some good theories , but I 'm just a perceptive A &; R man who can push buttons with the best of ' cm . If you need that kind of information , you 'll need to consult a specialist from Paleo-Technical . " <p> " And they would n't just tell us something like that . The inventor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if just anybody could find out his or her identity . " <p> " Okay , " he said . <p> " So you do n't know how to build a timefield generator from scratch ? " I asked my Other . <p> He laughed . " Of course not . " <p> " Me neither . We 'll just have to hope he 's sharp enough to figure it out on his own . " <p> " What the hell are you talking about ? " my Other said , looking perplexed . <p> The barmaid tried to charge past us , but I stopped her with a piercing whistle . She looked startled . So did my Other when I ordered six Guinnesses . <p> " Two for you , two for me , two for John , " I explained . Then I handed him the dead man 's palmtop . " Read this . Then we 're going to invite a guest to our table . " <p> John Lennon was smashed before he got halfway through the second pint . He did n't look half as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was onto the cracked upholstery . He squinted first at my Other , then at me . His glasses were nowhere in sight . Nearly knocking his pint over , Lennon once again picked up the dead man 's palmtop unit , turning it this way and that . <p> " Gear toy , " ' he slurred . " Sort of , you know , like magic . Always loved that . Magic , I mean . " He pronounced loved like luvved , very scouse , very working class , and , I thought , very affected . <p> I stood up , suddenly conscious of my bladder after the copious drinking . " That 's it , then , " I said . " It 's yours . If you figure out how it works and what it does , you 'll quite literally change the world . " <p> Lennon smiled disarmingly . " Got that covered already , " he said . <p> " No doubt , " said my Other , also rising . looking a bit awed . " One way or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiously , just for a second , before going back to his new toy . My Other and I backed away . <p> After a trip to the men 's room , we were outside again , watching the bits of trash blow across the cobbles as afternoon settled into evening . Some of the dock-worker types were evidently heading off for evening shifts . The nattily clothed office types had begun drifting away after the Beatles ' last set and were now entirely gone . It was getting quiet . <p> My Other looked troubled . " Do you think that was the smartest thing we could have done ? " <p> " How should I know ? The Manual does n't cover this . We had to improvise . All we know for sure is that our dead friend came here from some other timeline 's version of Alternitech . From the Technology Division . " <p> He nodded . <p> " And his palmtop told us enough about his mission to make rock ' n ' roll and even literature seem trivial alongside the larger issue . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to terms with our truce . <p> I pulled my own palmtop from my coat pocket and held it up before my Other in a kind of salute . It vibrated pleasingly in my hand as it powered up , the energies of the timefield washing over me . <p> " So which timeline survives after we leave the here now ? " my Other asked , I presumed rhetorically . <p> Does it matted I wondered . Whatever Lennon 's destiny as an artist , I hoped my Other and I had at least preserved the most crucial part of the life of our mutual Subject : John Winston Ono Wells Lennon : the discoverer of practical time travel . <p> " Goo Coo G'Joob , " said my Other just before he vanished from sight . <p> <p> By Michael A. Martin <p>
