Mary Soon Lee 's last appearance in these pages was one of her SF stories , " Universal Grammar , " just a few months ago . Now she proves herself to be equally adept with fantasy . The gentle tale that follows grew out of the writing workshop that she attends in Pittsburgh , where she lives . <p> A seagull flew through Fera 's dreams all that night . Its wings stirred the air over her head , its cry stirred a yearning she could not name . <p> Fera woke with that yearning , a wild , irrational thing that she thrust aside impatiently . Today would be as yesterday , and the day before , and the many years before that . Wishing would n't change that . She stood up from her bed , her claws clicking on the marble floor . Standing hurt her back . After a minute , she sank down onto four legs and padded into the bathroom . <p> Gold and silver fittings winked at her in the winter sunlight . The mosaic floor showed lilies and yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only in the cobwebbed splinters of the fractured mirror did Feta see ugliness . She made herself stare at her shaggy , brutish reflection , as she had every day but the first  --  that long-ago day when she had torn through the castle , saliva slobbering down the matted fur of her face as she yowled in madness . <p> Fera twisted the tap on with one awkward paw , and bent forward to let the water stream over her head . The chill water braced her , but something was wrong , an emptiness lurking inside her . With dripping wet fur , she paced out to the garden . Snow crusted the lawn , iced every twig and branch , frosted the edges of the winding paths . <p> At her coming , the birds flew away , calling out warnings to each other : Alarm ! Alarm ! The monster approaches ! <p> Fera stalked across the snowy lawn , her damp clotting with frost in the piercing cold . She understood the bird 's speech , and every warming call bit into her , hard though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend who would listen to her without running away . She left the garden and entered the wood where Wolf lived . <p> " Wolf " called Fera , her tail wagging in anticipation . <p> No answer . <p> " Wolf ! " still no answer . Fera stopped and sniffed the wind , scenting for Wolf . There , to the east . But there was another smell too , a human smell , and an iron undercurrent flavoring the air . Blood . She raced toward the smells . Intruder : there was a human intruder . <p> She came to a glade where a silver-gray carcass by gutted on the ground , where an old man crouched over Wolf 's body , the warm blood coating his fingers , a knife in his hand . <p> The man had not heard her approach . In a great leap Fera knocked him over . The knife dropped soundless into the snow . She opened her jaws over the wrinkled folds of the old man 's thin neck . <p> " Please , " croaked the old man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth dimpling his skin . Maybe because he did n't struggle underneath her , maybe because it had been so long since a human had spoken to her , she raised her head and let the old man free . She covered the fallen knife with one heavy paw . " Why ? Why should I spare you ? " <p> The old man started as he heard her speak . He pushed himself into a sitting position , shivering . " I beg your forgiveness . I lost my way in the snowstorm . I was cold , I  --  " <p> " You trespassed on my lands and murdered my friend . " Fera looked at Wolf 's still body . Her throat closed up , and she could not speak . <p> The old man fumbled and pulled a leather bag from under his coat . " I have money I can give you in compensation  --  " <p> Fera growled . " I do n't want your money . You will come to my castle . If you are civil company , I shall let you live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " But my sons , " said the old man , " my sons are waiting for me . They will think me killed . " <p> " I care not what they think , " said Feta . With one claw , she ripped the gold chain that was all she wore from around her neck . Gently , she laid the chain on Wolf 's open chest . Gently , she pressed her nose against his cold nose , and for the last time breathed in his deep , comforting odor . <p> Then she turned to the old man and bared her teeth again . " To the castle . " <p> At supper that night , the old man sat at the . opposite end of the banquet table . His eyes widened as he studied the crystal goblets , the green jade bowls resting on the jade plates . He did n't ask why the goblets were empty , the plates bare of food . <p> " Supper , " said Fera . The banquet hall darkened for a moment , shadows appearing and disappearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soup steamed in the bowls , roast beef waited on the plates , and raspberries and tangerines lay heaped beside jugs full of cream . <p> " That 's a useful trick , " the old man said dryly . <p> Fera grunted in reply . The old man was trying so hard not to show his discomfort with her , nor surprise at his surroundings . He had said nothing when he first entered the castle , but she had watched his gnarled fingers rub at the silks and jeweled ornaments , as if he did n't quite believe they were real . <p> Now she watched as he lifted his soup spoon and sipped at it . Lowering her own head , she licked up the soup from her bowl . Over the rim of her bowl , she eyed the old man . He looked at her , looked back at his soup , looked at her again , and then picked up his bowl and drank from it directly . <p> Feta raised her head , soup dribbling down her chin . " I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perhaps not , but I 'd feel awkward , " said the old man . And when he 'd finished the soup , he picked the meat and vegetables up in his fingers . <p> Neither of them spoke again until the meal was over . Then the old man said softly , " The wolf that I killed , could it speak too ? " <p> " Aye . " Feta stared fixedly at the white expanse of the tablecloth . <p> " I am sorry , " said the old man . " I would give much to undo that slaying . " <p> Fera looked up from the tablecloth and met his gaze . " I would know your name . " <p> " Petrov . And yours ? " <p> " Fera . " <p> " And your friend the wolf 's ? " <p> " I called him Wolf , nothing more . " Silence fell between them again . <p> The silence stretched into the second day , and the third day , and the fourth , broken only when Feta ordered supper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were kept , or how he should clean his shirt . <p> They spent most of the time in the library . Feta paged clumsily through book after book . Sometimes she was distracted by Petrov shifting in his chair , and she would glare at him , all the more irritated if he was too absorbed in his reading to notice . Sometimes she stared out the tall narrow windows at the snow , remembering how Wolf tossed his head when he was amused , the way the coarse hairs of his coat had shaded from red-brown to silver-gray over the years . <p> On the fifth evening , Petrov looked up from a history book and asked quietly , " When may I go home ? " <p> Feta growled deep in her throat but said nothing . <p> Firelight played in the hearth behind Petrov . He looked old and shrunken against the bright flames . " May I leave here in the spring ? " <p> " No , " said Fera . She gazed into the flames , seeing a silver-gray carcass spread-eagled in the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " No , " said Feta . " You killed my companion . Now you will keep me company . " <p> Petrov raised his eyebrows . " Well , that makes perfect sense , seeing how much pleasure you 're deriving from my company . " <p> His tone was dry , but when he turned back to his book something in the set of his shoulders , in the way the lines pulled in around his eyes made him look sad . Feta shook her head impatiently : why should she care how the old man felt ? She picked up her own book , but her muscles ached , and she could n't find a comfortable position in the chair . <p> With a growl , she set the book down . " Do you play chess ? " <p> Petrov nodded slowly . <p> " Will you play a game with me ? " <p> Petrov nodded again . " I 'd like that . " <p> Feta showed him where the chess set was . Without any fuss Petrov set the pieces up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fera 's paws . They played in silence , but Petrov smiled as he laid down his king at the end . " Good game . Do I get a return match ? " <p> And so they played another game , and played again the next day . A week later they were varying chess with backgammon and cards ; a week after that they discovered a mutual interest in mathematical digressions . On dry days they shared brief walks outside , Petrov cocooned in a ridiculous abundance of scarves and sweaters . When it snowed they wandered inside the castle . <p> Petrov liked to visit the art gallery on the second floor best . Each time the paintings were different , save for the one at the end of the first hallway : a portrait of a young girl with ivory-smooth skin , red lips curved in a smile , gold-bright hair . Petrov often paused there , and raised his eyebrows in question to Feta . <p> But the spell held Feta silent : she knew that once she had been the girl in the portrait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say anything of her life before the curse was laid upon her . <p> In the third month of Petrov 's stay , they were walking together in the garden . The lawn was mostly clear of snow , the air full of smells and growth and green . Feta sniffed busily , and pointed out the first crocuses , not yet in bloom . <p> Petrov beamed , his mouth crinkling at the corners . He sat down on a bench , and rubbed at his left knee . " Spring 's my second favorite season . Do you have a favorite ? " <p> " Summer . " Feta growled softly , remembering warm nights spent in the woods , rolling over in the long sweet-scented grass . <p> " Summer 's too hot and proud , " said Petrov . " I liked it best when I was a child . Then when I was a young man , I switched to preferring winter , just because no one else liked it . My wife ... " He stopped , and for a moment he looked frail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I do too , from harvest through to first snow . Crisp apples , the colors of the leaves , bonfire days . I remember her best in autumn . " <p> Feta scowled , her insides knotting up . Petrov was unhappy and she , she felt guilty . But she should n't  --  he was the trespasser , the murderer . She thought of Wolf and tried to summon anger , but it twisted into grief . " I 'll be back soon . " <p> She left Petrov alone , and ran for the cover of the trees . There in the shadowy gloom , where the snow still lay on the ground , she paced back and forth . She 'd take Petrov to the gallery again this afternoon . He 'd put this mood behind him soon enough . She turned it over and over in her mind , but it was useless . Guilt still ate at her . <p> Finally , furious with herself , she galloped back to Petrov . " Go , " she growled . A burning , prickling sensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . Take what you need from the castle  --  boots , food . " <p> " My thanks . " Petrov stood up . His face was stiff , unreadable . He laid one hand on her shaggy back . " I 'll go home to my sons . " <p> " Aye , " said Feta . " Do that . " <p> Petrov 's hand tightened on her fur . " I 'll miss you . " <p> Feta stared at him , but none of what she wanted to say would emerge . In the end , she just muttered , " Go . " <p> " I 'll come back , " said Petrov . <p> " There 's no need . " Feta turned and walked away . <p> In the weeks after Petrov departed , Fera stayed in the woods . She ate grubs and squirrels , mice and rabbits , taking fierce pleasure in their squeals as she caught them , savoring the blood-scent as she trapped small creatures in her claws . <p> She did not speak . She tried not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halves of conversations . At night she slept in the glade with Wolf 's body , by now a cage of bones open to the rain and wind , the two of them silent . <p> Gradually she lost track of time . It might have been a month later , it might have been two when she heard a distant clattering , the faint boom of the bell at the gate to her grounds . <p> Petrov . Fera raced for the gates , muscles pumping the long mile till she reached the iron gates . <p> Outside stood a young , exquisitely handsome man . His full lips curled in disgust as he looked at Feta , then altered to a forced smile . He held out one smooth white hand in greeting . " Good day , milady . My name is Omegon , son of Petrov . " He pulled his hand back after barely brushing Fera 's extended paw . <p> " Petrov 's son , " said Feta , trying to keep the disappointment out of her voice . " Come in . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , since my father has told me so much about you , I thought I should pass on his good wishes . " Omegon gestured behind him at a black horse and two saddlebags . " If you would see that my belongings are taken care of . " <p> Feta stepped toward the horse , and watched it skitter backward . " Maybe Petrov forgot to mention that most animals are scared of me . You will have to take the horse to the stables yourself . " <p> " Very well , " said Omegon , but two spots of high color stood out beneath his elegant cheekbones , and Feta did n't like his peevish tone . Indeed , apart from his appearance , she was n't sure that she liked this young man at all . But she thought of his father and tried to stay civil . <p> " The stables are over there , " she said . " I 'll be waiting for you at the main entrance to the castle . " <p> Ten minutes later , Omegon joined her at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 0 " as he took in the marble hallway rising to the wide curve of the mahogany stairs . He swiveled his head to study the ornate ceilings , the details picked out in gold and silver , the sculptures and paintings , and the fifteen-foot tall crystal windows . <p> His delicate pink tongue licked his lips once . " I see my father did not exaggerate the beauty of your castle . " After a moment 's hesitation , he added , " Or of your gracious ladyship , of course . " <p> Fera snorted before she could control herself . Petrov would never have described her as beautiful : sturdy , maybe , or muscular . Recovering some of her manners , she asked , " Have you journeyed far ? Are you hungry ? " <p> " Two days ' ride , and I confess I am a little hungry . " <p> Feta led him to the dining hall . Her feet left muddy tracks on the floor , and she was acutely aware that she must smell like a barnyard . She noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was seated at the far end of the banquet table , he seemed to relax . Indeed his eyes positively sparkled after Feta had said " Dinner " and the dishes had filled with food . He took out a thin leather book from his pocket and flicked through the pages . <p> " What is that ? " asked Feta . <p> He flushed . " Nothing , just a hobby of mine . I , ah , study the lore of enchantments . " <p> " I 've studied the.history of enchantments , too , though I have been unable to find any texts that contain much more than hearsay . " Fera leaned forward in her eagerness , a chunk of meat dangling forgotten from her claw . She caught a glimpse of the cover  --  illustrated with something that looked like a frog  --  before Omegon thrust the book away . <p> " I 'm sure my humble book would n't interest you , milady . " His knuckles whitened on his silverware , and he sliced one neat portion of meat . He lifted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taking a sip of wine , he added , " Has anyone ever told your ladyship how eloquent your eyes are ? " <p> Fera snorted . " I would n't have guessed that Petrov would teach his sons to be flatterers . Or did you come by it naturally ? " <p> Omegon had the grace to look discomfited . " It 's not , that is , I do realize your ladyship 's appearance is unusual . But there can be much beauty in the unexpected . " <p> Feta blinked . In the long-ago , men had whispered to her such sweet things as this young man did . But now , now either he had too much wine , or he was shortsighted , or he was a liar . She found herself hoping it was one of the first two . Even if only for one evening , she would like to be able to pretend that she was beautiful again . <p> Omegon stood up , and rested his arms on the back of his chair . Smiling at her , he started to sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a crown , ten thousand look for beauty where they know it will be found . " <p> His voice was pure and rich , taking the simple tune and giving it depth . Feta closed her eyes and listened . <p> " A princess in a palace , a rainbow in the sky , let thousands look for beauty where they know it will be found . But I would see the cactus bloom , and I would see you smile , and know your love I 'd found . " <p> Warm , sweet breath wafted over her face . Fera opened her eyes just in time to see Omegon lower his lips to hers , and she believed , yes , she believed that he loved her , as youth must surely sometimes love , wildly and without rational cause . <p> For one moment his mouth pressed against hers , and then he stepped backward , his expression darkening . " You look just the same ! " <p> Feta touched her lips with the edge of one paw , probing the spot where he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she did n't recognize . " How else would I look ? " <p> The young man sank into a chair , and buried his face in his hands . " Beautiful , like a princess . My father was right . I 'm nothing but a fool . " <p> The thin book slipped onto the table , and Feta saw the title " On Enchantments to Recover Ensorceled Princesses . From Frog Princesses to Beasts . " <p> She laughed , because anything else would have been too painful , and because she had been as much of a fool as this young man . More so , since she was old enough to know better . Not every curse can be lifted , even by a young man 's kiss . " At least , " said Feta finally , " you sing well . " <p> Face still hidden in his hands , Omegon muttered , " I am sorry , Feta , for lying to you . I , I think I 'd like to leave now . " <p> And he ran from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the main gate , the book clutched tight in one paw . " I believe you forgot this . " <p> " Thank you . " He hesitated . " That song , my father made it up when he came home . He thinks you found him too old and too boring . He thinks that 's why you sent him away , but he never stops talking about you , on and on and on . " The peevish note had returned to Omegon 's voice , but Feta barely noticed . <p> Something stirred in her , wildly and without rational cause . " Tell him I miss him . Tell him I would like it if he came to visit . " <p> And on a day in early summer , not so many weeks later , Petrov came riding to the castle . His hair was gray and his skin was wrinkled , and his knuckles were swollen with arthritis . But Feta found him beautiful enough . And if , in the darkness of some night , they held each other close for comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By Mary Soon Lee <p>
