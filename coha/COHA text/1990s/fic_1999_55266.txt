died . The two were related . " Willpower ! " my father said . " I will keep my tooth from decaying . " But decay it did . Every day he 'd show us his molar as proof of the immense powers of his will . We saw the hole grow bigger , work its way down the side of the tooth , eat into my father 's gums . <p> " Why is the word ' gums ' plural ? " said my youngest sister . She was very literal that way . <p> My father was not my mother 's husband . Her husband was gone , somewhere . I had called her husband " Dad , " and now I called my father " Dad . " I had called other men " Dad . " I had fathers coming out of my ears . <p> My mother used to evaluate men with a number : " sixty " ( said disparagingly ) ; " forty " ( said with disgust ) ; " seventy-five " ( said with some interest ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was talking about how much money she thought they made , in thousands . She used to collect money memorabilia , things like a paperweight with a dollar bill preserved in glass , and a pillow with " Love is nice but get the ice " embroidered in red thread . On the living room wall hung a picture of Ginger Rogers looking like a goddess and wearing faux coins over her breasts and groin . <p> My mother looked younger than her age  --  " That 's the single biggest advantage of being Japanese . Are you memorizing this ? "  --  and her skin was gold and flawless and radiated with what I can only call invitation . In fact , my three half sisters and I were memorizing her every word . My half brother , Raymond , did n't have to memorize anything , since he would grow up to be the hunted , not the hunter . As such , he was both more special and less interesting than us girls . <p> My mother kept her jewelry collection in a safe deposit box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my older sister Marilyn to the box to look at its contents . Perhaps I remember it as more grand than it was . But to me it was splendid , and it was all appraised , the occasional phony parceled out to Goodwill or the Salvation Army . " Even poor women like to look nice , " said my mother . " A man who gives a woman a fake diamond is not a man at all , " she said . " It 'll all be yours when I die , girls . " She said this last in a cooing voice . At the bank I picked up the heavy gems and weighed them in my hand . It was as if I were weighing my future . She said her collection was worth " a hundred . " She took a bracelet from my hands and turned it in the light . She gazed at Marilyn and me proudly as we leaned against each other , gaping . " You understand , " she said softly . " I can tell you do . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She and Marilyn admired the pearls , which looked strangely like a shiny noose around my sister 's throat . My mother suggested we each take one item home , to spend the night with . <p> At home later , I sat in the bathtub for an hour wearing only a diamond bracelet while my sisters pounded on the door screaming that they were going to wet their pants . I held up my wrist to the light or laid it on my stomach and watched the diamonds glisten wetly . <p> I aspired to be my mother , but my mother did not have high hopes for me . Mostly , I was what she called her " little nitwit , " because I liked animals , which were " totally useless , " and I had only passable manners . She practiced good manners  --  " A woman without good manners might as well be dead "  --  but she did n't believe in them . They were just a way of getting another bauble . There were other things a woman might as well be dead without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without blinking , and that certain curve at the waist . She did not believe in exercising because she feared it would destroy that certain curve . Marilyn and I used to spend hours dissecting our mother 's every word , and examining ourselves in the mirror , wondering just when we might actually develop the coveted curves . Unlike our mother , we were both skinny girls . Both of our fathers were thin . <p> My mother was not Raymond 's mother . We did not know my half brother well . Over the years , he had stayed the night with us occasionally , when our father and my mother were out on a date . But he had only come to live with us a few months earlier , when Marilyn 's dad moved out and my father moved in . We girls secretly used to call Raymond " Mr. Pedestal " because he never had to clean up or learn all the tricks we were learning . All he had to do was watch TV and get straight A 's at school . He had first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we wanted to watch a show , we had to cajole him . The only exception to the first-choice rule was Hawaii Five-O , which he always let us watch since he understood the futility of trying to resist the force of four girls screaming at him . He knew girls possessed powers he could not understand . We liked the theme song for Hawaii Five-O , and we all planned to live in Hawaii when we grew up . Book ' em , Danno ! <p> My half brother was like a little emperor , soft and rosy-cheeked , smug and imperious , the kind of boy who would n't get girls in high school but would marry some pretty little meek thing when he grew up . He watched us while we cooked and told us when to add salt , and how much , and while we scrubbed the kitchen floor he would point out places we 'd missed . " There , in the corner , a spot ! " <p> While we practiced walking in our room with books on our heads and earrings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already acquiring my father 's stentorian overtones . Every so often , during a gap in the music we listened to , we would hear him demanding , " Ou est la biblioteque ? " Or , " Et vous , qui etes vous ? " <p> " Vous , tu , nous , " we whispered , giggling . Sometimes , to torment him , we 'd whisper in his ear , " Vous etes le king . " " Vous etes all powerful . " But he was above that , and ignored us . <p> My father was one of my mother 's few Japanese lovers , and he was taller than her only by virtue of the lifts Marilyn and I discovered in his shoes one day . My father hoped to save my mother from her own depravity , partly with his incipient ( and half-hearted ) Christianity , but , more importantly , with his understanding of the differences between right and wrong . " Wrong is tricky ! " he explained one day over dinner . " Right comes at you straight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! From the food in front of you ! From delicious food ! Sit up straight , Katie . " He poked at my shoulder blades , and I sat up . Then he poked at my stomach . " Wrong can come from inside here , and from other places , deep inside you . " Evil resided deeply , he said . He nodded knowingly . From the side of my eyes , I could see my sisters looking at me . I knew what they were thinking : " I 'm glad he 's not my father . " But they called him " Dad , " too . We all called all our dads " Dad . " <p> I thought I knew what my father meant , but he never asked . I thought he meant that in modern times people are held back by their conventions . They 're sneaky bad . They had nice families and stuck their hands down your pants . They had good jobs and made you pay higher rates for their loans . Every so often , my father would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a day or even a week earlier . The trick was , you could n't just repeat what he 'd said . " Explain it with your own twist ! " he 'd shout . " With your own twist ! " So I was ever ready to agitate on the subject of right and wrong , if only he would ask . I was also ready to comment on the Cubs problem , the inferiority of the American League , and the successes and failures of the Chicago school system . <p> My father was one of those Japanese for whom you could never be American enough . He did n't like us to eat Japanese food . Fish cakes , for instance , were pink , and pink was a come-on , it was a frill , it had no substance . Raw fish was a health hazard . Fermented soybeans ! You knew from just looking at fermented soybeans that they were not meant to be eaten . <p> So instead we ate pancakes , hamburgers , Chef Boyardee pizza , Spaghetti-Os , Campbell 's Chicken Noodle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate at IHOP . They gave you all the syrup and butter you wanted , and it was real butter , not margarine like we had at home . His only bow to Japaneseness was rice , which he could not live without . In fact , from listening to him talk , you 'd think the biggest problem between him and his former wife had been that she fed him potatoes every night . <p> Meantime , I was screwing my way into hell for sure  --  with Jimmy Dime , no less . What a name . We screwed in concrete passageways , on the rocks at the beach near the Evanston-Chicago border , and in Susie Fitzgerald 's mother 's bed . Susie Fitzgerald 's mother worked nights , so that was kind of convenient . <p> My parents did their screwing after they thought we were all asleep , but the extraordinary noises always woke us up . He made love to her with a passion bordering on violence . He was consumed with her . Some nights at dinner , he did n't lecture at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . <p> The first day of summer , my father took us to Grant 's Park to see what he called the bums , which is what he called many young people . We had been to Grant 's Park many times , but always to see the fountain or the skyline . In fact , we 'd been to Grant 's Park just that winter , but with another dad . I remembered that we girls wore miniskirts , and bitter cold stung our thighs . Now , in our cutoffs and sandals , we watched the bums . My father was " dressed down " in a stiff golf shirt , golf trousers , and a beret over his crew cut . The bums were n't doing anything , really , but every so often my father would lean in and say to Raymond , " Look at that one . " Many of the men admired my mother . Such a beauty crossed almost all lines , Democrat , Republican , bum , executive , man , woman , or what have you . <p> My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . My sisters and I walked behind . Raymond turned around and caught my eyes . He took several Matchbox cars from his pocket . " Here , carry these for me , " he said . " They 're too heavy . " <p> He handed them to me as my father watched benignly . I knew it would be hard to carry the cars , since my pants were so tight you could not have slipped a playing card into the pockets . I looked to my mother for support . She just smiled sublimely . Did I forget to mention ? My father was a rich man . He had his own company , which made shoelaces . Even the shoelaces on the very sneakers I wore to P.E . classes were made by his company , though Marilyn 's father had bought the shoes for me at Woolworth 's . <p> My sisters and I walked like princesses following the emperor and his parents . We held our heads high , the way we had learned . Books on our heads . I carried the royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his hips looked at my mother . " Yum ! " he said , licking his upper lip . He leaned forward and reached out toward one of her nipples , barely , or maybe not even , touching it . He sat on a bench with several other young men . <p> My father whipped toward him , startling all of us . <p> The man 's eyes lit up . " Really ? " he said with delight . He stood up , ready to fight my skinny little father . But the young man did not understand my father and his inner angers . With the back of his hand , my father slapped him so hard he fell back . Then my father continued to slap him repeatedly . We all watched , stunned , while the man fell to the grass and my father kicked him , over and over , thud , thud , thud . <p> " Dad ! " I screamed when no one else moved . " Dad ! " I grabbed at him from behind , pulled at his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He came to , straightened out his shirt . The man lay on the ground with his mouth bleeding and a tiny blue convertible next to his ear . His friends leaned over him but looked up at my father . My father turned to my mother . " Are you okay ? " he said . She was fine . Even the wind had not stirred a hair on her ravishing head . <p> Later , on the El home , my father said to Raymond , " A man defends his honor . " That did not explain the beating . I think my father , insecure about his size and race and even insecure about his insecurity , could not believe this beautiful woman was his , as indeed she was not , nor was she any man 's , or , rather , she belonged to all of them who could afford her . One of the loveliest necklaces in her collection was from my father . He walked in her spell , and incidents such as with the young man broke the spell in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father could not tolerate . <p> " Close the door when you enter the bathroom ! " my father often shouted . He made us wash our fingernails when we peed . We felt defiled when we pooped . When we pooped , we had to wash especially well . I usually spent the time with the water running while I played with my mother 's cosmetics . For my younger sisters , there could be no more toilet humor . This only made such humor all the more precious to them . Whenever I saw them huddled together laughing and whispering insanely , I knew they were making toilet jokes . <p> And then it happened . First , a car struck Raymond as he walked on the sidewalk . After the accident , I gave him my blood because we shared a rare blood type and because my father did not believe in blood transfusions from strangers . While studying Raymond 's blood , the doctors discovered he had leukemia . My father 's son , my half brother , the little brat , was sick , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marrow could save the future emperor , maybe . <p> " Why me ? " I cried to my mother . " He treats me bad ! " <p> " I would n't wonder , with such an attitude . " <p> My father shook his head at me . " An attitude like that comes from the darkness deep inside of you . " <p> So I gave my marrow , which I admit was painless ; and , later , I gave more blood . My father said Raymond had a rare blood type because Raymond was special . <p> The doctors were shocked at my body 's reaction to the marrow transplant and the blood donations . My skin turned pale , then white , then gray . My father wanted to fatten me up , figuring I 'd have more marrow that way , in case more was needed . I got chubby , but also grayer . I made my father pay me a dollar a week for standby donation services , and demanded five dollars should another blood or marrow donation be necessary . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the color in his bratty cheeks made me feel ... something . <p> At school the other kids called me Gray Girl . I put lipstick on my face , brighter and brighter . I used my mother 's amazing makeup palette that could turn her into an angel . I got kicked out of music class for wearing too much makeup . And still Jimmy Dime kept screwing me . <p> I never ate so much liver . Liverwurst , pate , liver and onions , chicken liver omelettes , liver and mushrooms , and even , when my father got desperate , raw liver . Chicken liver , turkey liver , calf liver , beef liver , veal liver , and one day goat liver , though where my father got this and what was so special about it I still do n't know . My father begged the doctors to take more of my marrow . " It 's good marrow , " he insisted . <p> Every morning , I had to get up early to give the room a chance to stop spinning . My fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under my eyes crinkled like an old woman 's . My ears rung . The ringing sounded like singing . It sounded like Smokey Robinson . Very pretty . At school I sometimes lost my balance and fell into the lockers while the hallway full of children spun . <p> My father watched TV with us every night after he got back from the hospital . We watched dramas . Comedies . Good stuff . But he never noticed . He watched the screen with dead eyes . <p> Every so often , as much out of curiosity as anything , I accompanied my father to the hospital . One day , we stood in my half brother 's room as he slept . I saw something funny in my father 's eyes . I 'd never seen it before , and could n't place it . I studied his plain face , trying to understand what exactly I saw . Then I knew : it was love . I stared at my father . He did n't notice me . I 'd seen my father 's eyes filled with pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship , but never love . I 'd thought his heart incapable . <p> I 'd known for a couple of weeks that I was pregnant , but I had n't told anyone . I felt fear , dread , and hope . For a moment , seeing my father 's love , I thought about telling him of the baby inside me  --  me , his soon-to-be-fourteen daughter . But I did n't tell him , because I realized the love in his eyes was not meant for me . <p> My half brother was on a respirator . My father took one of his hands , and motioned me to take the other . My father closed his eyes and began murmuring , " Willpower ! You will not die . Willpower ! You will not die . " I got a weird feeling as I held Raymond 's hand , which was even clammier than mine . I felt as if he had also given me blood , as if the same blood coursed through both of us , as if we were Siamese twins . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was the first person in the world to know how lonely he had been in his short life , pointing out spots , reciting his French , friendless except for my father . I was also the first in my family to know he would die very , very soon . <p> Jimmy Dime got a car that winter . It did n't run , but it was good for screwing , if we kept our parkas on . There was a long seat in back , and I could stretch myself out fully , or fold my flexible legs up over my head as Jimmy pounded . After the first time in the car , we lay contentedly afterwards . " I 'm getting fat , " I said . <p> " There 's just more of you to love , " he said . Jimmy Dime loved a good cliche . He kissed my cheek . <p> It was a cold , cloudy evening . Earlier , walking home from school , I had delighted in the clarity of the blue sky . Now , the clouds hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm pregnant , " I said . <p> That was what finally made Jimmy Dime want to stop screwing me . Not the avoirdupois , not the gray skin . Those special words , " I 'm pregnant , " that have struck fear in the hearts of millions of young men throughout the ages . " It 's not mine , " he said , and that was the last time I saw Jimmy Dime , except spinning through the hallways with the other kids . <p> I lay on the car seat and let the cool air caress my knees . In truth , silly me , I felt I was ready to be a mother . <p> Jimmy Dime should n't have worried . A couple of weeks later , I lost my baby at Susie Fitzgerald 's apartment . I was walking home one evening from the Reach Out Center , where kids went " to keep off the street , " when a pain in my stomach staggered me . I struggled to Susie 's , pounding on the door . She let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was a minor celebrity because his father 's second cousin played in Johnny Carson 's band  --  on the living room couch . Frank gazed at me dazedly from among the leopard-skin cushions . I stumbled into Susie 's mother 's familiar room , and collapsed onto the bed . Susie followed me in , worried . " Are you drunk ? " she asked . <p> " Yes , drunk , " I said . <p> Then she seemed annoyed . " That bedspread cost fifty dollars , " she said . " If you 're going to throw up , please please go into the bathroom . " So I got up and had my miscarriage instead on Susie Fitzgerald 's mother 's bathroom floor . I took off my skirt and panties and felt the sticky blood spread down my thighs . I cried . I prayed . I wanted God , but would have accepted the Devil . But nobody came to me . My blood trickled down my legs and onto the tile . I thought I could hear my mother saying , " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I carefully moved my skirt away from the blood . The tile was cold on my cheek . A funny feeling came over me , unlike any feeling I 'd ever had before . I concentrated , trying to place the feeling . Disconnected words entered my mind : God ... blood ... pate . And then I thought , Why me ? Not , why could only I save my brother ? Rather , why could I not save him ? <p> Why ? <p> The day he died what was left of my father 's tooth fell out . He did n't even notice . Would a dead man notice if a tooth fell out ? <p> Later that night an eerie silence fell over the city as the first blizzard of the season hit . It seemed like the quietest blizzard I 'd ever been in . Years later , I lived in Los Angeles . After the riots of 1992 , and the earthquake of 1994 , I knew similar eerie silences . These silences reminded me of that night my brother died , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have never heard such sobs , animal-like groans that came from somewhere deep inside of him where I thought only wrongdoing resided . <p> The clock glowed orange . <p> At three in the morning , I heard my mother in the kitchen , and I got out of bed and went to her . My father still sobbed in the background . I do n't know what I wanted to say . My mother , still dressed , was heating milk . Finally , I said , " Mom , have you ever been happy ? " <p> She stroked my face and spoke gently . " I have bigger fish to fry , " she said . <p> I went back to bed , lying in the quiet that was broken only by my father 's sobs , and thought about the men who had loved my mother , how for years they came and came , like locusts . How eager they were to have their hearts broken , their egos crushed . Some of them were really nice . I mean , really and genuinely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about my brother , his straight A 's and his Matchbox cars that he played with alone for hours . It was getting light out . Still my father sobbed . What were these fish my mother had to fry ? <p> Gray skin , bums , locusts , diamonds . Wrong , right . I was half-asleep . At some point , my father stopped sobbing . Spaghetti-Os . The silence was finally complete . Finally , silence . <p> <p> By Cynthia Kadohata <p>
