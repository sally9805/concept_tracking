<p> Gen. Colin L. Powell , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , is opposing the use of military force to rid Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction , as the Bush administration resumes what has been an intermittent debate over how to deal with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein , according to officials . <p> Iraq 's resistance to United Nations orders to destroy its remaining ballistic missile equipment has again raised the prospect of a military confrontation with U.S.-led forces . But Powell has told his military service chiefs that a new bombing campaign would be unlikely to destroy the bulk of Iraq 's non-conventional weapons or compel Saddam to do so , according to authoritative sources . Other senior officers , who describe themselves as sympathetic to Powell 's views , said a military strike would carry substantial peril for U.S. forces and risk a political backlash among moderate Arab states . <p> Ranking U.S. officials yesterday cautioned against expecting any imminent military move , saying they expect Iraq to back down from its current resistance to U.N . mandates . But the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared detailed contingency plans , and there have been conspicuous moves recently of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf  --  including F-117A " stealth " attack jets , F-4G anti-radar planes and the USS America carrier battle group  --  that officials said were intended to send a message . <p> The long war of nerves with Baghdad , already complex and contentious , has been further complicated by the start of the presidential campaign , which U.S. officials said yesterday has forced Bush to weigh more carefully the potential domestic political implications of any action he takes . <p> " Anything he does will be seen as politically motivated , and anything he does or does not do has the potential to affect the election big-time , " said one official . <p> A political adviser to the president said a confrontation with Iraq has " enormous down sides now " and denied that Bush might order one for political gain . " If he uses military force and it does n't work , he 's Jimmy Carter in the desert , " the adviser said . " If he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gotten Saddam the first time . If he does and it works , a lot of people are still going to be suspicious it was politically motivated to take our minds off domestic troubles . " <p> Senior and mid-level administration officials yesterday described ongoing work at the White House and Departments of Defense , Treasury and State as contingency planning aimed at assembling options for Bush . At the same time , senior officials at both the White House and State Department said the president intends to proceed only as part of an international coalition , and almost certainly would seek additional authority from the United Nations before ordering a strike on Iraq . <p> " We are not going to go it alone , " said a White House official . <p> Powell 's resistance to the use of military force , shared by at least some of his fellow chiefs , is said to rest on the belief that imperfect intelligence and Iraq 's demonstrated ability to move its weapons put " surgical " removal of the targets beyond U.S. reach . <p> Moreover , Saddam is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily be far smaller than one during the gulf war , and he might even be strengthened , one officer said , " by standing up again to this enormous military machine . " <p> Powell 's view puts him at odds , at least in emphasis , with national security adviser Brent Scowcroft , who was described by officials as taking a harder line on the need to demonstrate U.S. resolve and put an end to a pattern of confrontation and retreat in dealing with Iraq . These differences mirror the somewhat contrasting positions taken by the men in the months following Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 . <p> In the end , said a ranking Pentagon official , " there 's only one person 's vote that matters . " <p> The president was widely described by White House officials as frustrated over Saddam 's continued defiance and " disposed " or " predisposed " to take military action if a U.N . inspection team , which is due to arrive in Baghdad on Saturday , leaves Iraq March 29 without results . <p> At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.N . commission charged with disarming Iraq , said that the March 29 date is not a deadline , and spokesmen for the State Department , White House and Pentagon yesterday emphasized that point . <p> Besides the military option , Bush 's aides have offered a series of coercive and punitive measures to use against Saddam . They include seizing the $ 1.5 billion in Iraqi assets frozen after the invasion of Kuwait . A senior official said yesterday that Bush has authorized the State Department to begin consulting other governments for their approval to take that action . The assets would be turned over to the United Nations to pay for expensive inspections and enforcement measures ; dispatching of teams of U.N . inspectors to investigate and publicize human rights abuses in Iraq ; and using U.S. warplanes to further restrict the airspace available to Iraqi helicopters . <p> Meanwhile , Marine Gen. Joseph P. Hoar , who succeeded Army Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf as commander-in-chief of the Central Command , has orchestrated his forces and deployments in ways intended to remind the Baghdad government of U.S. military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources , an additional complement of F-117A jets  --  the centerpiece of the gulf war 's air campaign  --  flew into a southwestern Saudi Arabian air base near Musayf . Their arrival was described as part of a routine " swap-out " of aircraft already in Saudi Arabia , but the planes they are replacing have not departed . Depending on the repair status of the complex planes , there are now said to be 15 to 20 operational  --  nearly half the U.S. inventory  --  on any given day . <p> Also last week , the USS America brought its 85 combat aircraft and four support ships into the Persian Gulf , where no carrier had been deployed since Feb. 4 . Also with the America is the Aegis cruiser USS Normandy , capable of firing Tomahawk cruise missiles . Numerous other Navy ships in the gulf region , including two Los Angeles-class attack submarines , are also capable of firing the unmanned Tomahawks . <p> Yesterday , in an unusual public announcement , an Air Force spokeswoman in Germany said that F-4G anti-radar attack planes were flying to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relieve F-4G 's already in the gulf . Known as the " Wild Weasel , " the F-4G fires HARM anti-radiation missiles and would be used to suppress Iraqi air defenses in the event of renewed attack . <p> Pentagon sources said significant portions of Iraq 's air defense network  --  including radar installations , surface-to-air missile sites and anti-aircraft artillery  --  either survived the gulf war 's extensive attacks or have been rebuilt since . The result is that any renewed bombing could not be accomplished without some risk to U.S. pilots , according to a combat aviator with access to intelligence . <p> " It 's not like we can just stroll right in and bomb with impunity , " the source said . Although much of Iraq 's air defense network was destroyed in the first five days of the air war in January 1991 , " they had a lot of stuff warehoused . We would destroy radars and a couple of days later they would be back up because they were taking them out of the warehouse , " said the aviator . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some targets , such as surface-to-air missile sites near Iran , because they were not relevant to any specific military objective . <p> Iraq has apparently been able to reestablish communications links between air defense " nodes " that had been severed during the war . " They 've had a year and they 're good engineers , " he said . " They have a very high percentage of computer-literate people . " <p> Apart from the F-117A and F-4G , Air Force aircraft in Saudi Arabia and at Incirlik air base in Turkey include F-15E and F-16C attack jets and EF-111 radar-jamming planes . The British Royal Air Force , diplomats said , has a squadron of about 12 Tornado bombers at Incirlik as well . <p> Also in the region is the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit of more than 2,000 Marines , whose reinforced battalion of infantry is the only nearby U.S. ground combat capability . <p> Although all administration spokesmen were cautious yesterday , the Pentagon seemed especially eager to play down expectations of imminent combat . " Right now we think the appropriate way to resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production facilities is to work for the U.N . special commision , " said Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams . " There are a lot of administration people out there talking , saying various things , some of whom appear to have no idea whatsoever of what 's going on . " <p> Ekeus said the U.N . inspection team expected to arrive in Baghdad on Saturday will try to reach agreement with Iraqi authorities on a list of missile-related equipment that the U.N . wants destroyed and a plan for disposing of it . <p> However , Ekeus reiterated that while the team is scheduled to leave Iraq on March 29 , he does not regard that as a deadline by which Iraq must comply or face military action . Ekeus said that if his inspectors are obstructed in efforts to get an elimination plan , he will report to the U.N . Security Council that Iraq is not complying with its obligations under the Persian Gulf War cease-fire agreement . <p> Staff writers John Lancaster and David Hoffman and special correspondent Trevor Rowe at the United Nations contributed to this @ @
