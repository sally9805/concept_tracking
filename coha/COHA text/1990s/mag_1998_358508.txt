Usually when a movie star dreams up an extravagantly ambitious and costly project , the world shudders , knowing the result will be an overblown , unwatchable exercise in narcissism . With Tom Hanks , though , things are different . Hanks is so modest and so intelligent that if he invests himself in a film there 's good reason to believe it has merit . There is also reason to hope it will be a success . While it 's satisfying to see certain stars get their comeuppance , Hanks seems to be someone who deserves to flourish . <P> The extravagantly ambitious and costly project Hanks has dreamed up is From the Earth to the Moon , a 12-part mini-series for HBO that tells the story of NASA from the first Mercury mission in 1961 to the last flight to the moon in 1972 . It will be shown in one-hour episodes on various dates over a six-week period , beginning this Sunday , April 5 , at 8 p.m . E.T . Hanks , who starred in the movie Apollo 13 in 1995 and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the production . It was an extremely complicated undertaking , involving scores of actors , elaborate special effects and several directors  --  among them Sally Field and Hanks himself ( he also wrote one episode , in which he appears , and co-wrote three others ) . With a budget of $68 million , From the Earth to the Moon cost 10 times what HBO usually spends on an original program . <P> The result ? Based on the five parts available for viewing , this mini-series is anything but a vanity project . Rather , it is a diligent , well-crafted work that never spins out of control despite its grandiose conception . And yet , as anyone with an ear for faint praise can tell by now , it is pretty dull . That may seem hard to believe , given the subject matter  --  space exploration !  --  but watching From the Earth to the Moon induces a state of cognitive dissonance . The acting is first-rate ; the details look right ; still , the overall effect is boredom . <P> How can this be ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Moon tries to tell is too vast to be contained even in 12 hours . The movie Apollo 13 was a success largely because of its simple , intense narrative  --  guys go up in space , look as if they 'll die , succeed in not dying . The mini-series is much more diffuse . Hanks and his colleagues have tried to be selective , but the smaller stories they tell either are not the right ones or are not dramatized effectively . <P> For example , episode 2 , set in 1967 , concerns the investigation into the causes of fire on Apollo 1 that killed three men . The technical sleuthing is mildly interesting , and the two engineers at the center of the tale are sympathetic , yet the episode never crackles . The hour that follows focuses on Wally Schirra , leader of the Apollo 7 mission , who is played by Mark Harmon . In an irritating device , Peter Horton is a documentary filmmaker who questions Schirra and others . The result is an aimless string of interviews ; Schirra talks more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
