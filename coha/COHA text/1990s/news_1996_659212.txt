<p> This is a story for anybody who has ever stared off in the distance , thought of a long-lost love and wondered , " Whatever happened to ... ? " <p> This is the ultimate Valentine 's tale , the saga of a blind college wrestler who fell for a nursing student , and of the 20 years they spent apart while never quite forgetting each other . <p> Start with a disapproving mother , toss in a note undelivered , and mix in marriages to other people ; it seemed as if Gene and Mary Ann Manfrini were not fated to be together . <p> But something had happened when Gene met the shy nursing student in 1953 , something about her voice , something about her he can not define , and could never forget . And so , all those years later , he tracked her down . <p> In many ways , the Manfrinis ' story is echoed in a recent study of people who have loved , lost and then , after many years , reconnected with their old heartthrobs . Hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objections , moving away , the passage of time and other marriages . Reunitings happen at all ages , says psychologist Nancy Kalish of California State University . <p> And it 's usually the man who takes the first step . <p> Like Gene Manfrini , now 67 , who bounds from room to room in his New Jersey home with such authority you 'd think he 'd leave a wake . Blind since age 2 , he needs only a quick touch on the kitchen countertop as he passes to get his bearings . <p> " Wrestling did a lot for me , " says Manfrini , who excelled at it at Columbia University in New York . " It gave me the confidence to do anything I wanted . " <p> Mary Ann Manfrini , 64 , a tall and slender former nurse with short salt-and-pepper hair and a direct manner , is more reserved than her ebullient husband . " He 's the one with all the romance , " she says . <p> The story started when a 25-year-old Gene auditioned a 21-year-old Mary Ann to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girlfriend . <p> It started with that something in her voice . And later , he says , " when I finally got my arms around her , that felt nice , too . " <p> Mary Ann was quickly drawn to the handsome , muscular athlete who played piano , got around town without even a white cane and " just took control of everything . " <p> " When we decided to go out , all the arrangements were made . He would tell me when he would pick me up . Wherever we went , he took me and brought me home ( by bus and subway ) ... To me , this was quite a feat . " <p> For three months , they dated . Gene could n't afford anything fancy . So they walked through city parks . They went to Columbia football games . He got student tickets to the opera , way up in the top tier . <p> And for the first time in their lives , each began to think about marriage . <p> One night , after a performance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Bronx and kissed her goodnight , as usual . <p> It was the last time he 'd be with her for years . <p> Suddenly , she started refusing all his calls . Gene was devastated . What was going on ? <p> It was her mother , " a very dominating force in my life , " Mary Ann says . Gene was not what she wanted for Mary Ann . Breaking off the romance was " easier than fighting with my mother . " <p> Once , about a year later , Mary Ann sent him a note suggesting they get together - but by then , he was living with a woman , who , he says , saw Mary Ann 's note and did n't tell him about it . <p> When Mary Ann realized no reply was coming , " I felt he just did n't want to be bothered with me . " <p> Gene married the woman in 1954 , and Mary Ann went to the wedding , sitting in back of the church and saying nothing to anybody . She left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that was the final thing , " she says . <p> Three years later , she married a classmate . <p> By then , Gene Manfrini had found that colleges were n't interested in hiring a blind man to teach music . He turned to piano tuning , which combined his musical ear with his wrestler-strong hands . This career took off , and he eventually handled instruments for the likes of Vladimir Horowitz , Arthur Rubenstein and Irving Berlin . <p> But his marriage , which included two daughters , was not going well . He thought about Mary Ann quite a bit . <p> " I just wondered how she was , " he says , " how she was doing . ... I never forgot her . She was just engraved on my mind . " <p> In the late 1960s , he finally called Mary Ann 's mother to satisfy his curiosity , and she later mentioned the call to Mary Ann . <p> But once again , Mary Ann did n't want to see Gene . Not now . She had enough complications . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 4-year-old daughter . <p> Yes , she had thought of Gene over the years , especially during the bad times in her marriage . " I said , if I had just made up my mind to marry Gene Manfrini , I would n't be in this mess I was in . " <p> Too late now , she told herself . " You do n't fool around with somebody else 's husband . " <p> And so it remained until 1974 . Gene , divorced and unable to locate Mary Ann , happened to meet a friend who ran a detective agency . Could he find a long-lost friend ? <p> Soon , a private eye went up to the Bronx neighborhood where Gene had kissed Mary Ann good night so long ago . Her parents had moved away , but he found a neighbor who knew how to reach them . <p> It 's urgent , the detective said : An old patient of Mary Ann 's had died and wanted to leave her a pile of money . Much later , the detective would explain the whopper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone would respond to it . " <p> And it indeed worked . Curious about who this benefactor could be , Mary Ann told her mother she 'd take a phone call . <p> " Do you know a Gene Manfrini ? " the private eye asked . <p> " Oh my God , did he die ? " <p> " No . He 's very much alive . And he 'd like to see you . " <p> Soon after , on a cold January day , Gene took a long bus ride to Glens Falls , N.Y. , where Mary Ann was now living . <p> She spotted him at the bus station . <p> " Hello , Gene , " she said . <p> He put his arms around her and kissed her . And he was shocked . <p> " I thought , ' I have the wrong person ' ... My whole world is feel and hearing . She sounded the same , but I was stunned ... I said to myself , ' What happened to her ? ' " By his arms ' reckoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , she was still Mary Ann . And before long , they were running up $ 300 phone bills . <p> In March , the normally reserved Mary Ann asked him over the phone , " Are you going to marry me or what ? " <p> He was so surprised he could n't answer at first . But he recovered enough to say , " Of course , I will . " <p> They wed on April 19 , 1975 . <p> Now , they live a short stroll from an Atlantic Ocean beach . At their anniversary this year , they 'll be able to savor the triumph of being married for as long as they were kept apart . <p> " If somebody has made an impression on you , you always wonder , " Mary Ann says . " You do n't forget about it : Where are they ? What are they doing ? " <p> " If you 're in a position to go find that person , " she says , " I 'd say go . "
