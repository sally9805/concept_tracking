At Knopper 's Bank , Steven was a nephew with a place to make where two sons and a brother-in-law had precedence . When the American was announced , he broke off dictation , clapped his hands to tell Audace to close her book , and released her . Not much had to be explained to her . In the two years she had I been with Knopper 's she more often cued him than the other way around . <p> The American was waiting in the reception hall . Audace had acquired the firm 's taciturn manner , and said only , " How do you do , Mr. Rowell . Mr. Steven Knopper is expecting you , " paused , and indicated that she was to be followed . " Please ? " He did n't mind at all . Her few words rang musically , Huh do y ' dooo ? Mr. Rowellll ? His ear said Irish or Scottish . How nicely she had accented How , as if she expected an answer . <p> An impression of a freckled face chimed off her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few seconds to appreciate her figure before she stepped aside for him at the office door . He looked directly into her face and saw , in the biblical phrase , that it was good  --  that is to say , well formed , with intelligent bronze eyes , and a thumb-like nose that gave her the look of wading in , taking things on . For her size , a formidable field-hockey player : she would have a leg or a stick or a hip in when the opposition thought it was in the clear . <p> He was already thinking in campaign terms : She would be congenial to talk with . She carried herself as if she could dance . He liked figures he did n't have to turn the lights on to see . If she was Scottish , the odds were good that religious issues would not be a problem between them . He decided she was Scottish . He thought of introducing her around at annual gatherings of the Murdocks , his mother 's side . <p> Calvin Rowell had been sent over to straighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the top bosses would be on him . If he did as well here as he had in Bangkok and Sydney , the numbers would be impressive and the chairman and CEO would know . The road to manager of Fanston , Europe , was open . In Dallas they did n't know such a job existed . It was in Cal Rowell 's head . <p> This was his first meeting with the London bankers who would introduce him around . In the course of the meeting he learned that the Englishman had been with Alexander , Auchinleck , and Montgomery in Africa . Rowell had been on destroyers in the North Atlantic . The men bonded so thoroughly that one of the introductions Cal said he would like  --  on second thought , not an introduction , clearance , he wanted clearance ( " If it 's in order , Steven . I do n't want to do anything that will make anybody uncomfortable . I expect you to be candid with me " ) to ask the young lady to have dinner with him . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go ahead , ask her , if that 's what you 're thinking of . Only do n't steal her . She 's been with me two years and she 's priceless . " <p> In 1954 women at Knopper 's were still thought of as girls at twenty-seven , and it was understood that if they took work with the firm , they should not aspire to something different from secretary . When they were in their forties and had been passed along to their second partner , they were addressed no longer as Agnes or Cynthia but as Talbott or Merlydock . Talbott , can you take care of that ? Merlydock , how do we do this ? This was thought of as a promotion . Steven 's wife would have preferred that he have a secretary of Knopper 's Bank 's surname generation , but settled for the conviction that the bank was his shot at a very high place and that he had too much grit to be distracted . She was right . <p> Steven felt that Americans of the business class took girls out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratified that Rowell had foreseen complications in asking to date the secretary of a man he did business with . <p> Audace was neither Scottish nor Irish ; she was Welsh . Her name was not Jones , Edwards , Evans , Cadwallader ; it was one of those railroad-station names that looked as if the typist 's fingers had shifted on the keys . <p> " Audace Llanrwst . Have I got it right ? " <p> " Right . Lenrist . Let me introduce you and say a word on your behalf . " <p> " All right . Do n't make it an order . " <p> " You will be serious with her , wo n't you ? Think of her as my sister . " <p> " I 'll do better . I 'll think of her as mine . " <p> He took Knopper 's suggestion and left up to her what to do on a May evening in London . She did n't accept " Whatever you think , " nor did she nag for answers . She offered alternatives and inspected his replies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife knows how to throw a party . " He liked to see sights , he liked restaurants that served people from the neighborhood and whose kitchens did simple foods well . <p> The Thames launch made a ceremonial pass under the bridge to review the roofs and spires of Parliament . Standing beside him , she read off the cardiogram of the British heart that had , within that decade , on the word of an authority , survived in its finest hour : the Clock Tower , Westminster , Jerusalem , St. Margaret 's , Victoria Tower . <p> " Love you , love , " the launchman said , " you 'll have me job , " and reversed to head downriver . The launch bucked as it met the tide . They had to lock themselves in place . Their eyes met , amused . <p> " Reminds you of the North Atlantic , does it ? " <p> " It lacks only a submarine watch . " <p> " You got the radar from us , did n't you ? That was part of our share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything in money , is it . " It was a philosophical observation , not a question . <p> They came back to London every year or two after they were married , and the city for him always was Audie at the rail of the launch , ringing the names of Parliament , of buildings and bridges decorated like desserts  --  There now , Cal , the Tower of London , the Tower Bridge  --  designed to be served by men wearing pantaloons and nutty hats fit for an English queen . Saying the names of wrecked majesties of the Industrial Revolution and Nazi air raids  --  docks , warehouses , iron masses of derrickage , and power plants : Cannon Street , Oliver 's Wharf , St. Katharine 's , Deptford . Of empire : Greenwich , Royal Observatory , Naval College . <p> That evening , respectful of her Thames-guide performance , he asked , " How do you know all that ? You 've lived here only two years . " <p> " We were taught it was impolite not to remember . " She would remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanged biographies . Released from the habit of the office , she spoke freely , and he missed a detail here and there only because he kept falling into entrancements . He had given up thinking of her as his sister . Thinking of her as Steven 's was feasible . She had been brought up at St. Cyllans , the keep of Lord and Lady Rhysden , one of the great castles on the Irish Sea coast of Wales  --  " But not that part of the castle . We had our own cottage . My mum was the cook , and my papa was an agriculturalist . Rhysden azaleas are famous . In the catalogues you see many well-known cultivars worked up by Evan Llanrwst . " <p> He thought he understood what a cultivar was by the context . People would say , " Azaleas ! If you want to see azaleas , take a look at Audie Rowell 's . " They would want her for president of the garden club . <p> " The Rhysdens and Clynnevins are quite important families . When I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Queen , and the Yorks with Elizabeth "  --  whose coronation had been the pageant a year ago . " She was my age . " Audie showed a slyly humorous grain he had suspected . " It must be some distinction to be the same age as a Queen . You might ask your new advertising agency if it would get my name in The Times . " <p> " Why do n't you ask directly and save the commission ? " <p> " It seems self-serving . If you had the distinction of being the same age as the Queen , would n't you want somebody else to mention it first ? Ha ! I 'll tell you who else came to St. Cyllans when George was still York  --  Lord Rothschild . The Duke of York and Lord Rothschild were agriculturalists . They came especially to see Papa . They talked by the hour in the greenhouse . The French Marshal Foch was a guest at St. Cyllans . " That was all past . " I clerked at Birmingham Hospital during the war , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and came to London to do better . " <p> " And you did . " <p> " Oh , yes . Mr. Knopper is very fine to work for , and I have met an American . " She slid it in so that it took him a second to hear that she had kidded him , and she was on to something else , asking with acute interest , " Is your work going wellll ? Mr. Knopper is set on your doing well . He spoke to Mr. Porcelli . He told him the bank is highly interested in Fanston . Do you find Porcelli a competent firm ? " <p> Yes , the subcontractors had the facilities , and they had not flinched at the proposed stocking arrangements . He was interviewing sales managers and thought he had a hire . He would probably take the accounting manager introduced by Knopper . <p> " You work at a ripping American speed , do n't you . I like that . " <p> He wondered how somebody as good-looking as this , who kept the ball in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted it . Had so few English men survived the war ? Was she a lesbian ? No , she would have said as much . She knew how to make known what she wanted . Was she holding out for somebody with evidently greater gifts than his ? Did she already have somebody ? Being a competitor , he got off that track . He had long ago decided that there was no benefit in making cases against himself . <p> The light dissolved in another coronation as the sun fell behind western chimneys . May or not , it was cool on the water . He thanked her for bringing her brother 's sweater . She was wrapped in a scarf the size of a hammock . Her brown felt hat bore a badge that would have bluffed a sheriff . The English sure knew hats . The evening rapidly went from cool to chilly . Her cheeks bloomed ; she cuffed a handkerchief to her nose . The meaningless act , an intimacy implied , bred desire in him . <p> The launch pulled shoreward . She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lit in the dining room ? " <p> They were let off at an iron stairway up to a street where a restaurant had a cannel-coal fire and a window side toward the river . Men with open collars and women in sweaters and skirts had supper and draft at tables around them and seemed as much at home as the more obviously affluent . The barley soup was thick and hot , the sole fresh-caught , the asparagus as edible at one end as the other . White potatoes snapped under the fork . Oil barges , hooded refuse lighters , launches , police boats , became firefly lights , while in the higher sky black bulks were profiled by the retreating sun . <p> The way to the taxi was narrow and cobbled , silent , dark ; all commerce had fled . A single building walled in the street on the side they walked ; on the other , dark facades irregularly admitted doorways and alleys . Each next light was twice as far away as his eye judged it should have been . The lamps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not yet come on after the latest . He supposed the area was safe . He did n't want to ask . His mood was that she trusted him . He would give a good account of himself if necessary . Enough light remained for a sign lettered beside a door to be read : NO HIRING . <p> " Were you ever without work ? " she asked . <p> " No . I went from college into the Navy . When I came out , Fanston took me on as a sales trainee . " <p> " How well you 've done ! I think that must be the deepest ditch , between work and no work . " <p> " Were you ever without work ? " <p> " I was fortunate not to be , and my mum and papa were secure on the estate , but Wales  --  you could cry at the willing men with families and no work in Wales . Except in the war , it 's been that way since I was a child . " <p> He told her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had gone under with debt during the Depression . He had never been close to his father and had n't been comfortable being taken for a walk around the block and talked to about choices that were made in life . He had thought his father was telling him to study harder . That night his father had shot himself . He was glad to have the cover of the dark , and clenched his jaw to keep his eyes dry . He found his arm linked with hers without intending it . <p> They would say , " You can talk to Audie Rowell . She understands . " He thought that after waiting for it longer than others he knew , this might be a love that would last . He thought how to go about it with Steven 's sister . <p> He came back again in August for a family wedding in the parish church attended by the Llanrwsts . He apologized to Steven Knopper for stealing her  --  something he had been explicitly instructed not to do . Steven said it was unforgivable , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a village of inkwells , salt trays , seal boxes , quill holders , dogs , cats , landscapes , and other relevant Georgian matter . <p> Now , thirty years later , the Calvin Rowells were in London for a few days , quartered in a hotel 's corporate suite that when first leased , in the sixties , had been dirt cheap , and now outpriced anything in New York . Cal made a note to think this over before his audit committee raised the question . Today Audie had people to see , and the chairman of Fanston International was having lunch in Knopper 's Bank 's dining room with his old friend the managing partner . <p> Neither of them had anything to do anymore with ad agencies , sales managers , subcontractors ; that was the business of younger men . The shop they talked , at a table set with baroque silver , carved glass , china thin as a Dixie cup , on linen of strawlike shining grain , was of acquisitions , government policies , their mutual health and the health of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple gossip about mutual acquaintances who had run off the road- <p> " How could I have forgot ! " Steven interrupted himself with the exclamation . " Would you and Audie like to meet the Queen ? " <p> Did anyone answer no to a question like that ? <p> " Day after tomorrow , Thursday , at four o'clock . This wo n't be at Buckingham , although , if you 'd like it , on the next day honours are listed  --  " <p> " Let 's first get past Thursday . What happens Thursday ? " <p> " Thursday , Her Majesty will dedicate a collection at the London Small Treasures Vaults . This is an extraordinary group of sporting subjects of considerable antiquity , gold and silver and glass and so on . I have been somewhat instrumental in gathering the pieces and furbishing the gallery . I have only to ring up the Queen 's deputy secretary and have your name put on the list . Shall we do that ? " <p> " Audie will want to know what she has to wear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Audie will know what to wear or whom to ask . This is an informal occasion . People will be standing about , looking at the objects . " He pretended to try for a look at his friend 's feet . " Come as you are , if you are n't wearing brown shoes . " <p> " Striped shirt ? " <p> " Quite all right . You 're an American . It will be rather official for me , so I 'll wear striped trousers and black sack . " <p> " Not a striped shirt . " <p> " Ask Audie . She 'll know . " <p> Steven had not said , " Ask Audie to ring up Constance if she has any questions , " and the two men knew why . The first time Steven had them down to Usselton Hall , Lady Constance had been flawlessly courteous , if austere . The second time , they met mostly people who had business with the bank . The third time , Lady Constance had been unavoidably in Edinburgh on a family matter . Audie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be expected to associate in an intimate way with a woman who had been her husband 's secretary and was the daughter of a cook . <p> " Steven and Lady Constance have had a discussion , " Audie said . " Steven did n't quite lose , but he did n't quite win . " <p> Cal said angrily , " We do n't need that . It wo n't happen again . " <p> " I would feel very bad if this interfered between you and Steven , " Audie said . " It does n't bother me . It 's the way she was brought up . If you look at it the right way , do n't you see its comic side ? " <p> " I see it as deliberately insulting . " <p> " Constance thinks the opposite . She thinks she is being very good at avoiding insult . No insult has occurred if none is intended . She is the one obliged to wiggle ; we 're not . Think of it as a comedy . " <p> " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendar because his firm underwrites a hundred million dollars of Fanston paper . " <p> " You and Steven would be friends however you happened to come together . You are cut from the same cloth . Keep on playing it by ear . Just let 's talk it over before you accept any invitations Steven extends for weekends in the country . " <p> They had gracefully avoided Usselton in the years since . However , the invitation to meet the Queen on the neutral ground of the Small Treasures Vaults was certainly not anything like an invitation to Usselton . It presented no issue of snobbery or sycophancy . Queens were scenic , like pyramids or cathedrals . If you were in their vicinity , you looked . <p> Rowell treated the invitation as a surprise package and did n't open it until they had showered and robed , folded down the silk cover , and lay flat out to nap before dinner and theater . <p> " How would you like to meet the Queen ? " he asked the circlet of plaster roses on the ceiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought she might have missed the question . <p> " I 've met the Queen . " <p> He got up on an elbow . " You never told me that . You told me the royal family visited the castle . " <p> " You may not have listened . When I was a child at St. Cyllans , Lillo came every year . We played together . " <p> " You called her Lillo ? " <p> " We were eight , nine , ten . " <p> " I thought she was Lilibet . " <p> " Not at St. Cyllans . " <p> " You played with her ? What do you play with royalty ? Hopscotch ? Dolls ? " <p> Audie locked her hands together to hold the memory . <p> " We had a playhouse at St. Cyllans , like a real house , except that the ceilings were too low for grown-ups . The door openings cut off grown-ups at the chin . It was our house , for the children of the estate . After the Yorks arrived , Lillo would rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We played Receiving Queue . Like all children , we played Doctor . We played Cook . The people of Wales had a house made exactly like it and sent it to Windsor . Y Bwthyn Bach  --  " She inched back to the scene . " The Little House . Ours at St. Cyllans and Lillo 's at Windsor had the same name . I contributed my shilling at church . Lillo was quick at jacks . " <p> " Jacques ? " <p> " Jacks . Throw and pick up . You know ? We said rhymes with the tosses . Maudy Bominam ... " She set herself to recall the rhymes . " I guess that was ' Birmingham . ' Children just say sounds- <p> ' Maudy Bominam Throws down Picks up Throws down/Picks up This way/counts two Maudy Bominam/takes one/that 's done Takes two/do n't rue Takes three/chase a bee Try again/Not in vain ' <p> " The others shout , <p> ' In vain ! In vain ! Maudy , Maudy/Try again ! ' " <p> Audie could not contain her joy . She swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two miles a day on the nearest park path or treadmill . She poised to curtsy , saying with the act , " Extend left leg , point toe , dip right knee , back straight , eyes down . " She held out her hand limply . Imagination dripped off her fingertips . <p> " Would n't miss seeing Lillo ! She never came back to St. Cyllans after Edward took off with Mrs. Simpson . She was suddenly the daughter of a King and being made ready to reign . Do you think Queens are extraordinarily happy people ? I do n't . " <p> The next day Audie had shopping to do . She especially needed a little off-the-face hat , something she seldom wore and had n't had any reason to pack . <p> As Instructed , the party of more or less forty guests assembled in the gallery a half hour ahead of the appointed time . The treasures were displayed in cases and on tables , so conversation among strangers was easy , for if it failed to take fire from the runners carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another strike could be tried at <p> hunting scene enameled on silver gilt ( France , 16th century ) . Lady Constance , who came right up to the mark of kindness without crossing it , and Sir Steven introduced the Rowells to guests who were charmed ( glad , pleased , delighted ) to meet them , and others who may or may not have said something complimentary ; their views could not be determined through immobile lips and eyes that regarded the Rowells as if they might be sheltering a communicable disease . Offense could not be taken , as it was the way they looked at their wives and husbands . <p> " All now , please , " said Sir William Hessley , the deputy , a feisty gentleman who gave the impression that he would be more at home on a less cultural assignment . They should refer to the list and queue over there in sequence , as they would then match his list . He spoke to them as if he were making it up as he went along . <p> " That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He will prompt me . You know , I ca n't know everybody . Often I do n't even know the people I know . I get stagestruck . That does n't sound right . Stage fright . That 's better . The sponsors will be astute enough , I 'm sure , to stand in the area of the presentation to catch up Tommy if he has a problem with a name . Her Majesty and party , including Sir Seymour Teagle , Governor of the Vaults , will enter through that door in fifteen minutes and be announced . The guests will come forward behind Tommy . I will present . Everything will be quite informal , you know . The curtsy is not  --  not  --  necessary . An indication of a bow would be nice , do n't you think ? Like so . Well , if you laugh , that will only encourage me to play the fool . If Her Majesty offers her hand or a word or two of conversation , why of course respond . You all have common sense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require an audience , that 's quite another matter ; write to me at Buckingham . Her Majesty will speak briefly , and then proceed to view the treasures , guided by Sir Seymour and Sir Steven Knopper and Lord Cunningly . As Her Majesty has already viewed them privately , that should go quickly . We shall follow at a discreet distance , not to hurry those ahead of us . The royal party will proceed to the Governor 's suite , where we shall all have a cup of something and a protein . Now , if you will assemble ... Loosely is well enough . " <p> The Queen and party entered . <p> " I should say ten minutes for the presentations , Your Majesty . " <p> Scholars , dealers , donors , spouses , began to move toward the Queen behind Tommy 's lead . Without exception , they would have been annoyed if pressed to say exactly why they had cleared their schedules , refreshed their wardrobes , rehearsed their manners , for the privilege of having their names uttered to a woman whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their spouses '  --  whose position was not of her own making , for whom not even the League of Empire Loyalists claimed a power to heal the sick . Some things do not want to be looked at too closely : it was unnecessary ( even undesirable , considering that it led in one direction to hilarity and in another to whatever civil arrangement the Brits would devise to replace revolution ) to go beyond the fact that the Queen of England , Scotland , etc. , was the foremost person in any room in the world she chose to enter , save in Italy , Iran , and China . Of course one wanted to meet her . <p> This was far from a unique occasion for Sir Steven and Lady Constance , and when they arrived before the Queen , she gave her hands at once to both and was forward in saying their names unprompted . They inclined their heads and said , " Your Majesty . " <p> " This collection is certainly splendid . You should feel gratified , Sir Steven . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of it , Majesty . " <p> " How did you get the two Hedwig glasses ? Our German friends must have bid for them . " <p> His bone-lean face creased to show he would very much enjoy telling the story , but there was Hessley 's queue to keep in mind . He stripped it to essentials- <p> When he had been with Alexander in Cairo , an Egyptian boy had made himself useful , especially turning up with condiments and sweets not in the ration . The boy had a large wen on the lid of his left eye . Knopper had asked a medico if he could whisk it off . Two years ago Knopper had been in Cairo . He had looked up a dealer , Aboufari , he had heard great things about . They had been chatting for a few minutes when the fellow said , " You were in General Alexander 's army , were you not ? " <p> Yes , he had been with Alexander . <p> Aboufari put a finger on his eye . And of course- <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the story until later  --  secretary wants to move the queue . " <p> " Later , then . " <p> " Your Majesty , may I present our American friends , Mr. and Mrs. Calvin Rowell . Mrs. Rowell is our own , born in Wales . Mr. Rowell 's name you will recognize ; he is a foremost industrialist , chairman of Fanston International . " <p> " Oh , yes , " said the Queen . " How nice that you are with us , Mrs. Rowell , Mr. Rowell , " and extended her hand to a woman as aging as herself , whose head , wearing a clever rainbow-ribboned toque , lifted from a slight , concealing kowtow . The woman 's hand advanced to take the royal hand . <p> Her Majesty saw dozens of vaguely familiar faces every day . When she was onstage , any face in the United Kingdom caught by her eye was rewarded with the greeting that the always-known  --  film stars , politicians , royalty  --  have for the abstractly known . Audace Rowell received such an acknowledgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lillo could not be relied on to remember the face of a ten-year-old playmate at St. Cyllans . <p> Nor did Audie plan to pile on words of recollection while the Queen struggled with the message , pretended she had it , and the deputy secretary chafed at somebody 's going on and on , giving the rest of the queue a bad lead . Knopper 's Egyptian inning had already been unsuitably long . <p> Audie relied on the handshake , in which she transferred a spiky object from her hand to Lillo 's , and said , " From St. Cyllans , Your Majesty . " <p> The Queen 's hand involuntarily snapped back an inch until caught by the firm thumb and forefinger of the American 's wife . <p> Seeing the Queen startle , the deputy secretary stepped forward to give his life . He flashed on the idea of a poisoned Borgia ring , which had impressed him , when he 'd read of it in his youth , as a hell of a topping idea . Anytime an Italian was in the queue , Hessley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person was one of the U.K. 's own- <p> Coming alive in the background were two men the American industrialist had already classified under Queen 's Security . Restraining himself from making an unseemly fuss , Calvin Rowell nevertheless leaned to interpose his body between them and his wife . In Dallas two or three bystanders would have been within a second of being blown away . Audie would escape with a scratch from the bullet that first went through him . For a month the spokesman for the department would maintain that the first shots had come from the Rowells . <p> The historical reflection of the deputy secretary on the crimes of the Borgias , the alert of security and the counteralert of the American industrialist , the arousal of the Queen 's physician , who daydreamed through these things , all occurred in the same instant Queen Elizabeth needed to hear " St. Cyllans " and identify tactilely the shape in her hand . <p> She showed the jack to the deputy secretary to disarm him while she tried to compel the presence of a St. Cyllans name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had not been brought up to lose names from where they were supposed to keep . hey sometimes lingered on her tongue . She opened her mouth and one popped out : " Audace ! " Probably the first authentic delight she had experienced all year . Her upper lip rose to the gum , exposing strong and perfect teeth . A mask of laugh wrinkles sprang across the bridge of her nose , squinching her eyes . <p> " Audace ! " <p> " The very , Your Majesty . " <p> " It 's a joy to see you . " <p> Astonished at its own sudden unsteadiness , the ship of state began at once to right itself . Her Majesty tamped her emotion . She had to consider the queue , the Queen 's day , with another dedication and a diplomatic dinner before it ended . This event was rather fun but had run its course . <p> " My dear Audace , it is so very thoughtful of you , and amusing . I shall keep this treasure very near my hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasant memory . " <p> The Queen nodded assent . Sir Steven Knopper moved his party ahead . Behind them the deputy secretary said , " Your Majesty , may I present Dr. Estrella Martin , the well-known Egyptologist . " <p> The Queen must have had a sense of unfulfillment in the episode , for after the queue cleared and she made her dedicatory remarks and moved on to see the collection in its installed splendor , she said something aside to Sir Steven Knopper that brought him back to the guests , who now idled in the wake of the royal party . <p> " Audace , the Queen requests that you join her . Not you , Calvin "  --  he put a restraining hand on his friend 's arm . " Not at the moment . As we move along , however , drift forward . We 'll fall together . " <p> Not until they were alone on the leather cushions of the hired car , being driven back to their hotel , did they have a chance really to talk to each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I thought you might try to talk me out of it . I was determined to hand her that jack . " <p> " I would n't have said anything . You 're a better judge than I am of anything like that . But you overlooked a detail . I 'm surprised . You 're usually more thorough . " <p> " Oh ? " <p> He told her about the security men , and his guess that if anything like that happened in Dallas , " it would be the last scene in Hamlet . The Queen would be the first to go . " <p> She thought that was comic . " But not as comic as Lady Constance 's face . It was like a purse something had been stuffed in and she could n't snap shut . The Queen was going on about St. Cyllans and how I liked it in America and how you and I met  --  and yes , mind you , our children . I thought Her Majesty was going to show me family snapshots .

" <p> She thought about whether she would like it or not . <p> " Oh , I do n't think so , Cal . I would n't want to have to come back to England again for anything like that . I do n't want it to get to be one of those things where I have to entertain her if she comes to America . " And more : " I do n't want to start exchanging Christmas cards and wonder if I should wait to get hers first , so she wo n't feel forced to reply to mine , or if she will feel I did n't intend to send her a card until I got hers . I 'm trying to simplify my life . If it 's all right with you , I think Lillo and I have done it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking at . <p> " Up to you . There 's nothing going between Her Majesty and me . " <p> The most enviable lives have more than a fair share of loss , hardship , and monumental disasters , and it was something to be married to a woman who was a curator of life 's small treasures as well : gardens , the names of distant aunts , memories waiting to be drawn out of others to their delight . He knew he was going to hear that monologue again as a star turn at one of Audie 's famous dinner parties .
