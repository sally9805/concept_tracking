Henry handed his passport to the slender , uniformed man sitting behind the desk . <p> " How long will you be staying ? " asked the man . <p> He had n't thought about how long this might take . He knew that once everything was in order it would take only a few hours , twelve at the most , but how long to prepare ? <p> " A couple of months . " He smiled nervously . " I 'm doing some research . " <p> " You are with a university ? What kind of research ? " <p> " No . . . I 'm here on vacation . I mean I 'm doing research yes , but it 's personal . I 'm studying the churches here . " <p> " Well , we have many churches in Venice . Enjoy your stay . " He handed Henry his passport and a thin white card with a stamp that read Venezia , Porto . <p> Henry had been studying maps of the city for the last two days while aboard the Festos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen on the starboard side as the ferry made its way along the Canale della Giudecca to the edge of the city , finally coming to rest on the concrete shore of the port . Henry made his way down the metal gangplank , dodging freight trucks and other motorists , and onto Venetian soil . He breathed in heavily , but was disappointed with the still-present smell of automobiles . He followed the Canale della Scomenzera and the train tracks , until he found a bridge that crossed over the water and into the city . Passing through the Piazzale Roma , he began following the signs to the Piazza San Marco . He walked for an hour and finally decided he should find someplace to stay for the night . <p> Henry crossed the Grand Canal at the Ponte di Rialto and made his way to the Campo della Fava where he found a small inexpensive hotel , the Alla Fava . Henry 's room overlooked the Rio della Fava . It was old and furnished inexpensively with a bed consisting more of spring than mattress , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a private bath in this room and Henry was thankful that he would n't be sharing with others the embarrassment of bathing . <p> The room was somewhat dark and smelled of a moistness that had soaked into the walls and ceiling over so long a period that they had turned from warm colors to the cool , dark colors of old age . The most redeeming aspect of his room was not in the room at all but out of his window . There Henry could see the statues atop the Chiesa San Salvador . Henry loved Catholic churches and the thought of seeing one by simply looking out of his window brought a slow satisfied grin to his face as he stood , hands stuffed deep into the pockets of his grey flowing pants . He stood in this position long enough to watch the sun set over the church , reflect off the Rio della Fava , and fill his eyes with the warm light of God . Henry knew as he watched that God was with him , smiling on him , giving him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body 's need for food . Although he was hungry , he removed his clothes , lay down on the wide bed , careful not to make much noise , closed his eyes tight , and felt himself alone in his room . It was n't working . He felt too far away from God , too hungry , too much like a man who had no purpose . <p> He began to wash himself with a damp cloth , but decided instead to run a bath of tepid water . Standing naked before the water , he rubbed a bit of oil on his skin . He felt soothed by this and stepped into the tub , immersing himself in the water . When he raised himself out of the water he placed perfumed oil on his body . Feeling somewhat renewed , Henry dried himself with a large linen cloth . He then took up his dark gray trousers and put them on . He went back into the room , stood in the middle of it , his back to the window , his face to the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All-powerful God , Father of our lord Jesus Christ , by water of the Holy Spirit you freed your sons and daughters from sin and gave them new life . Send your Holy Spirit upon me to be my helper and guide . Give me the spirit of wisdom and understanding , the spirit of right judgement and courage , the spirit of knowledge and reverence . Fill me with the spirit of wonder and awe in your presence . I ask this through Christ our Lord . <p> Henry remained in this position , kneeling before the bed , silent , waiting for his prayer to reach the ears of God . When he felt that the spirit of God was upon him he rose and finished dressing . He turned off the lights in his room and went out to find a place to eat . <p> As he made his way through the poorly lit walkways of Venice , between one campo and the next , he was overwhelmed by the throngs gathering in the streets , as if on some sort of pilgrimage to the city where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed , down one of the larger streets , not too far from his hotel , a small restaurant called Marco Polo 's . He liked to think of himself as a Marco Polo , a traveler in a strange land making discoveries . This is why Henry was here , to make discoveries . <p> For years Henry had felt God breathing down his neck with the breath of life , filling his head with images of immortality in a seat next to Christ himself . But he feared , not just God or the responsibility that came with being a saint , but even more , that he might never be quite able to attain the perfection of spirit that God required of him . Henry felt weak in the presence of God ; this is why he continually asked for strength . He looked at his watch-twenty-five past the hour . He ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio , drank and ate bread sticks , and smiled with the smile of a man given new life by God . Henry ate well , finished his bottle of wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fava hotel where he slept like a child among the watchful eyes of heaven that flowed through his open windows . <p> The next morning Henry , feeling the effects of too much wine , walked the short distance to San Salvador . Upon entering the church , he placed his fingers in blessed water and made upon his body the sign of the cross . He walked along the black and red marble of the ambulatory to the front of the church and took a seat facing the opposite side . He knelt there and prayed to God for forgiveness of his sins . When he opened his eyes he saw her . She seemed almost too young to know , but when she looked at him through her tortured eyes he knew that she was the one God had chosen . Yet he had to be sure . A strange beast took over Henry 's insides and he doubled over in pain as he felt his stomach begin to rise . He stumbled over the knee rest of the wooden bench before him as he ran outside , bumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone posts . He ran . Out the wooden front door , through the tourists and weary walkers sitting on the steps before the church , coming to rest halfway between the church and a flower shop just across the way . <p> The pedestrians flew past him at a dizzying speed , the buildings moved . He felt people staring at him , pointing at him , children eating ice cream and laughing at him . Next to the flower shop he fell against the wall . On his knees , arm against the firmness of stone , hand against the moistness of brow , he slowly began to breathe , not in rapid bursts as before , but with a conscious effort common for him when he felt the call of God . As he regained his composure he noticed , on the lower right portion of his sport coat , a bit of vomit that somehow escaped his mouth . He removed his coat and carried it over his arm as he strode away from San Salvador , to the left between two buildings , finally sitting down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his coat for a sack of pigeon food he had purchased the day before while walking through the city . He fed the pigeons for a bit , put the bag away , and decided to walk on . He was at first tempted to head for the Grand Canal but decided against this because he was not fond of tourists . No matter where he seemed to go in this city he could n't get away from people . Just then , as he looked up from the path in front of him , he noticed that there , in the building across from San Salvador , was a Picasso exhibit . He paid the 10,000 lire and went inside . It was a small exhibit but he liked the work of Picasso ; it helped him to relax . As his mind began to clear he considered that he had been wrong . That was not the child God had chosen . But when he turned around she was there . She was small . Her hair was the most beautiful shade of brown and it framed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paleness of her skin was nearly more than Henry could bear to see . Her eyes were sunken with the pain of living , but her movements were innocent . <p> Henry held back his urge to run , once again , from his duty . He reached into the pocket of his trousers and brought forth a small vial of oil . He smiled at the girl as she looked at him . She returned his smile with one of her own , but her smile seemed fainter , not quite lifelike . Henry sat . He tipped the vial of oil onto the index finger of his right hand . He placed the vial back in his pocket and motioned for the child to come near him . She tilted her head slightly to the left , no , to the right but she was facing him so he was confused at first . She walked to him , floated almost , glided across the floor between them . She put her hand out . Henry began to reach for her . The woman standing next to him took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . How could he have been so careless ? He was here to do God 's work but what human could understand ? Henry was doing as God asked him to do , just as so many before him had done , and he had almost acted too quickly . He had to be patient . God would provide the time , just as He would provide the lamb . Henry , feeling tired and a bit ashamed of his impatience , returned to his room to sleep . As he lay down he noticed the clock read seven past the hour . <p> When Henry awoke he felt the cool stillness of the morning . He 'd slept almost fifteen hours . Henry pulled his suspenders over his shoulders , put on his slippers , and brushed his hair back . He headed down the three flights of stairs , straightening his shirt as best he could . He took a table near the door after he made himself a cup of tea and filled a plate with assorted pieces of food . As Henry sat eating , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . He could not see her , but knew she was there . Henry could not eat . He simply waited . <p> Soon she walked by him . She was alone . He closed his eyes and felt peace . This was the time . He rose , slowly , so as not to arouse suspicion . He followed her as she playfully ran up the stairs , her Abraham close at her heels . At the second floor she left the stairs and went into the hallway . <p> He waited . If this was truly what God wished , she would return . A door opened-then closed . He waited . A door opened and closed . Voices . No . A couple passed by , looking at him as if standing near the stairs was an act of a madman . A door opened and closed . Wait . A man in street clothes . Patience . Minutes dragged by . More people . These coming up the stairs . Those going down . A door opened and closed . Hair , wet , hung about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his temples , eyes closed against the world . A voice . Small . Is he feeling all right ? The oil . In his pocket . There , not too much . Can I help ? she asks . It 's my back he says , could you help me to my room . Her arm , so tiny , so frail , under his . His hand , his finger , on her temple . He anoints her , she is sick . No one has seen . A door opened and closed . She never felt the blow , it was too fast . <p> He kneels , face down in the bowl . He has filled it . His breathing returns . He is in control . He draws a bath of tepid water and immerses himself . He dries and puts on his robe . She lies on the bed . He sits in a chair facing her . Her breasts are so tiny . He stands over her , in her presence , feeling that he is under the eye of God . He washes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . It would n't be right . He sits again . Her skin is so smooth , so soft . She is without blemish . The time is drawing near . He must finish . He kneels before her and prays : God , the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , by your gracious spirit you have established the plan which now lies before me . You choose all , oh Lord , for you are Almighty God and we must but follow your plan . He stands . From a small piece of cloth he removes a ring and places it upon her finger : In the name of the Father , and the Spirit , I make of you a bride for our Lord Jesus Christ . <p> Into the wall above the bed Henry has placed three large hooks . First , binding her ankles and wrists with gauze , he hangs the child , arms outstretched like Christ , from these hooks . The skin of her wrists and ankles stretches and twists under the cloth from the weight it now supports . He returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soft gray , and places his bag near the door . He walks back to the foot of the bed and kneels before this angel that God has chosen . The first rays of the setting sun lick the room , bathing it in an immense brightness , engulfing the child , reflecting off her smooth , untarnished skin in such a way that she absorbs it and reflects it both at once . Henry 's hands are flat against each other , held before his chest . His eyes focus on the angel he has erected . He waits for God to speak . <p> She is engulfed slowly , from the ends of her hair , down the slight frame of her body , so that the light enters her and pours forth from her . Henry is blind with joy . <p> As the last rays of sunlight leave the room , when God 's hand no longer touches her , Henry stands . He is refreshed , renewed . He walks to the door , grasps the wooden handle of his leather bag , touches the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room one final time , opens the door , and walks forward with the spirit of God fresh in his soul . <p>
