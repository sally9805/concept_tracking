<p> Cooking with beer no longer means wienies and sauerkraut . Chefs in the Washington area and elsewhere are using fine beers as ingredients . They 're finding that beer does things that wine ca n't . In fact , there are those who think beer is more versatile than wine in the kitchen . <p> " There are far fewer food combinations with wine than beer that taste good , " says Charles Finkel , chairman of Merchant du Vin , a Seattle-based specialty-beer importer . Finkel , an alumnus of the wine business , attributes this to beer 's low alcohol content and its subtlety and finesse of flavor . Like bread , beer is made from grain . " What foods ca n't you have bread with ? " asks Finkel . <p> Dan Litwin , owner , chef and brewmaster of the Blue-N-Gold Brewing Co. , a brewpub in Arlington , suggests there 's only one occasion when a cook needs to have wine available : " When you do n't have the appropriate beer . " He estimates that a third of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change weekly and depend heavily on the beers available . Litwin has allowed beer to drive the menu to the point that his restaurant specializes in Creole cooking because " it 's bold enough for some of the fuller-flavored beers . " <p> Beer 's versatility in the kitchen is also due to its breadth of style . Never trust a recipe that calls for beer of unspecified style . Beer covers the gamut : sweet , sour , dry , herbal , dark , light , roasty , caramel-y , astringent , wild , tame , full-bodied , light-bodied , smooth , fruity , round and more . Beer writer Michael Jackson has said that more than 120 compounds have been identified in beer . <p> It 's hardly surprising anymore to discover that the restaurant down the street is hosting a beer dinner . And upscale brewpubs continue to buck the notion that beer is meant to be consumed with chicken wings , nachos and burgers . But until recently , writing on cuisine a la biere has frequently exhibited little understanding of the subject . Jackson cites an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  whatever that means  --  should never be used in cooking . <p> Litwin believes we 've only seen the tip of the iceberg in beer cookery : " It 's a matter of giving chefs the time with the ingredients . A year from now , it will be going in a lot more directions and will have a lot more depth . " <p> At the Virginia Beverage Co. , a brewpub in Old Town Alexandria , chef Bill Farrell is working on several new dishes incorporating beer . Farrell is new to beer cooking but reports , " I 'm having lots of success with maltier beers . " He has discovered several interesting combinations , including a beer fondue made with Extra Special Bitter , a salad dressing using barley wine and a steak sauce that includes strong ale . <p> One of the most basic guidelines governing beer in cooking , according to Litwin , is that , " A lot of wine goes a little way ; a little beer goes a long way . " Virtually all beers have a certain amount of hop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content evaporates ) . And Geert Piferoen , executive chef at the Belgian embassy , says too much reduction can change a beer-based dish 's color . So , better to add the beer toward the end . While hop bitterness is accentuated by long cooking times , it 's also true that the flavors themselves can evaporate  --  another reason to add beer late in the cooking process . <p> Until you 're familiar with individual beers , it 's best to add them late , and with a light hand . " You have to know the beer very well before you cook with it , " says Piferoen . Litwin suggests using about half as much beer as you would use wine in a recipe . <p> Another rule : Do n't cook with beer you do n't enjoy drinking . A mainstream American lager may be refreshing when consumed at close to frozen on a hot day , but it adds precious little in cooking . " Never try to cook with Bud or Coors , " says Daniele Johnson , chef and owner , with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Occoquan , Va . " If you cook with bad beer , you 're going to ruin the dish . Use very high-quality beer . " <p> What Cooks With What ? <p> Selecting a beer for a recipe calls for knowledge of each beer 's characteristics . The chef must decide whether the beer should complement or contrast with the other ingredients . <p> Litwin exploits beer 's aromatic properties to arouse the flavors in his dishes . He makes a chocolate silk pie filled with chocolate mousse made with his Old Crankcase barley wine . " It has a very molasses-caramel-like flavor , " he says . Herbs such as basil , parsley and mint can complement hop flavors . He cooks shellfish with lighter , hoppier beers like Pilsners . <p> For seafood , Daniele Johnson suggests a light beer , perhaps a Pilsner or wheat beer , or a Belgian gueuze for some acidic bite . A heavy brown beer like a Trappist dubbel will hold up well in a stew like carbonade a la flamande and wo n't impart excessive hop bitterness over a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sour beer like gueuze to wake up the flavors in sweet meats like rabbit and pork . These beers also make excellent marinades ; their acidity is thought to help break down fibers . She recommends a wheat or fruit beer to bring out the flavor in chicken . " It 's easy to overwhelm chicken , " she says . An acidic beer like Rodenbach helps cut the fattiness of duck . <p> " I love to make desserts with fruit beers , " says Johnson , citing kriek lambic ice cream as an example . She suggests melting chocolate with a splash of Trappist dubbel ale instead of water . An acidic framboise lambic can be the basis of an excellent salad dressing . <p> If he uses a bitter beer , Piferoen likes to sweeten the dish with a bit of honey for contrast , or accentuate the bitterness with endive . For marinades and red meats , he favors a red beer like Rodenbach or a dark one such as Chimay Red or Grande Reserve . A heavy blond beer  --  Duvel , Corsendonk Monk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meats . Piferoen is cautious with yeasty bottle-conditioned beers : " You have to be careful . Yeast gives the dish a dirty taste . " <p> What Drinks With What ? <p> To select a beer to accompany a dish , consider the principles of cutting , contrasting and complementing . And let your taste guide your selection . " You do n't have to go , ' white beer with white meat . ' Do n't be afraid to drink porter with fish , " says Litwin . About the only rule about matching beer with food , says Litwin , is , " Do n't lose the food or the beer . " <p> A light , acidic beer will cut a rich , creamy dish . As an example of contrasting , consider a sour kriek or framboise lambic or a bottle of Rodenbach with a sweet dessert . A Schwarzbier , Rauchbier or stout complements the smokiness and caramel flavor in barbecue . The chocolate-sherry notes of a Trappist dubbel ale complement coffee and chocolates . Finkel suggests a hoppy India Pale Ale to complement spicy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Running Press , $ 35 ) devotes several pages to matching beer and food . Jackson suggests a hoppy ale or Pilsner to arouse the appetite . Stout or porter with oysters is widely recognized as a ticket to nirvana . Full-colored , fruity ales pair well with red meats , while a malt-accented lager complements the sweetness of pork or chicken . With fish , a hoppy Pilsner is the analog to a dry white wine . Strong , sweet beers , such as Doppelbocks , barley wines and Scottish ales are excellent aperitifs . <p> Yes , but what about pizza ? Litwin says the malty palate and hoppy finish of Samuel Adams Boston Lager is perfect for refreshing the palate between bites , while Jackson believes the malty spiciness and sweetness of a Vienna-style lager complement the dish 's basil spiciness and cooked-tomato sweetness . <p> While you 're waiting for the pizza to arrive , here are some recipes featuring beer from both sides of the Atlantic . <p> BARLEY WINE VINAIGRETTE <p> ( About 2 cups ) <p> From Bill Farrell , chef , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ olive oil <p> 1/2 cup finely diced shallots <p> 1/4 cup barley wine ( strong British ale ) <p> 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar <p> 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme <p> 2 tablespoons Pommery mustard <p> Salt and pepper to taste <p> Put 1 teaspoon of the olive oil in a saute pan over medium heat .
