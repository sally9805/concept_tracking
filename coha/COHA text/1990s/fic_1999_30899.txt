In which I am told an extraordinary fortune June 23 , 1777  --  Trois-Ilets , Martinico . I am fourteen today and unmarried still . Without a dowry , what hope is there ? Mother says the wind takes hope and dashes it into the sky , just as the big wind took our house , picked it up and dashed it , leaving nothing but debts in its place . Oh , what a black mood has possessed me . Is not the celebration of one 's birthday supposed to bring one joy ? After dinner , after eating too many doughnut fritters with guava jelly , I took my leave and climbed up to my special place in the kapok tree . It was cool in the shade of the leaves . I could hear Grandmother Sannois and Mother arguing in the front parlor , the slaves chanting as they pushed the cane stalks through the rollers in the crushing hut , a chicken scratching in the honeysuckle bushes . I felt strange up there  --  peering out at my world , enveloped in gloom on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bitter-tasting quimbois Mimi got me to drink this morning , a drink of secret spells . " Something manbo Euphmie made for you , " she whispered . She 'd knotted a red and yellow scarf tight around her head . " Euphmie David  --  the teller of fortunes ? " The obeah woman , the voodoo priestess who lived in the shack up the river . Mimi pushed the coconut bowl into my hands . " It will bring you a man . " I regarded the liquid cautiously , for it smelled vile . " Quick ! " She glanced over her shoulder . For Mother does n't hold with voodoo . Mother says the Devil speaks through the mouths of the voodoo spirits . Mother says the Devil is hungry for girls like me . Mother saystge ? " France ! " Grandmother Sannois pushed her two pug dogs off her lap . " I 'd keep that girl well away from Madame Dsire . " Grandmother Sannois does n't approve of Aunt Dsire , or any of the Taschers for that matter ( especially Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Laniantin , " she said , downing her laudanum : seven drops in a jigger of brandy . " What 's wrong with that Beal boy ? " Algernon Beal ! The fat boy we all call Algie . " Monsieur Beal requires a dowry , " Mother said . " Monsieur de Beal , I believe it is now , " Father said , " the manufacturer of shackles and branding irons , the owner of three gilded carriages , twenty-two fighting cocks , an English Thoroughbred stallion and one dim-witted son . " Father coughed and emptied his glass . " Monsieur de Beal and I had occasion to converse at the slave auction in Fort-Royal last month . He told me at length and in great detail how large a girl 's dowry would have to be , how noble her bloodline , how abundant her bosom and intact her maidenhood even to dream of marrying his pimple-faced boy  --  " Manette had her napkin stuffed in her mouth to keep from laughing . " Well , there 's always the convent , " Grandmother Sannois said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be my future ? I yearn for so much more ! But it 's too late now , I know , for on this , my fourteenth birthday , Aunt Dsire made no offer , and , for the first time since I can remember , Father made no promise ... and I liked it better before , to tell the truth , with glittering false hopes to brighten my day . June 24 . This morning I gave my ten livres to the slave-master to divide among the field-ha nds . I am grown now and more aware of the sufferings of the world . But Mother found out and got cross , accusing me of being like Father . " Generous " Father who would let his family starve to feed a friend . " Crazy " Father with his wild stories and dreams of glory . " Dreams from the rum god , " she cursed . " Promises like clouds on a summer day . " Father who is never home . Already he 's off to Fort-Royal  --  " to play games with the Devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the she-devils , " Mother said quietly under her breath . Sunday , June 29 . Dear Diary , I have been giving thought to my sins , making repentance . I am guilty of wishful thinking , of extravagant imaginings . I am guilty of gazing at myself in the pond . I am guilty of sleeping with my hands under my bedsheets . There , it is written . The ink is drying as I write . I must close this book now  --  I can not bear to look at these words . Sunday , July 6 " Mademoiselle Tascher , " Father Dropper called to me after church this morning . " Your grandmother asked me to talk to you . " I fingered the pages of my missal . Outside I heard a horse whinny and a man shouting . " You are coming to an age of decision , " he said . His big nose twitched . " Yes , Father . " I could see the outline of his vest under his white frock . He paused . " I advise you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of service . " I felt my cheeks becoming heated . Father Dropper handed me a handkerchief . " The life of a nun might satisfy that hungry heart of yours . " Through the high open window I could see the head of the statue of Christ in the cemetery , His eyes looking up at the clouds . The hunger I felt was for ftes and silk sli ppers , for the love of a comely beau . He bent toward me . " I was young once , too , " he said . I could smell rum on his breath . " I would die in a convent ! " Forgive me , Father . I backed away . At the door I turned and ran . July 24 . This afternoon Mimi and I were playing in the ruins when Mimi saw a spot on my chemise . I twisted and pulled my skirt around . Blood ? " It 's the flowers , " Mimi said . I did n't know what to do . " Tell your mother , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper . So Mimi got me a rag which she instructed me on how to use . She told me she washes hers out in the creek , early , when no one is around to see . " Where we bathe ? " How disgusting . " Farther down the river . " I move around the house aware of this great cloth between my legs , thinking that surely everyone notices . This is supposed to be the big change in me , but all I feel is ill . Saturday . Mimi is teaching me how to tell the future from cards , how to lay them out , how to know the meaning . Today we practised on my sister Catherine . The card in the ninth place was Death . Catherine protested . " It 's not really death , " Mimi said , taking up the cards . She sniffed the air . Later , I questioned her . " Why did you stop ? " " Did n't you smell cigar smoke ? " she whispered . " The spirit of Death is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31 . Dear Diary , something terrible has happened ; it hangs over my heart like a curse . It began with a lie . I told my little sister Manette that Mimi and I were going to the upper field to see if Father 's ship was in the harbour yet . " You stay here , " I told her . Mimi and I headed up the trace behind the man ioc hut , but at the top of the hill we took the path that led back down to the river , toward Morrie Croc-Souris . We had n't gone far when Manette caught up with us . " I told you to stay , " I told her . " You lied . You said you were going up the hill . " Mimi glared at her . " Can you keep a secret ? " " I never tell ! " It was dark by the river ; the moss hung thick from the trees . We heard a chicken squawking before we came upon the fortuneteller 's shack . " That 's where the werewolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked at Mimi . " Is this it ? " In front of the hut was a charcoal brazier . The air was thick with the smell of roasted goat . In the shadows of a verandah roofed over with banana tree leaves , I saw an old Negro woman sitting cross-legged . Euphmie David  --  the voodoo priestess . As we approached she stood up . She was wearing a red satin ball gown fringed with gold , much tattered and stained and too big for her . Her hair was white and woolly , standing out around her head like a halo . A rusty machete was propped up against the wall behind her . Mimi called out something I could n't understand . The old woman said something in the African tongue . " What did she say ? " I asked . " Come , " the old woman said . A puppy came out of the shack and growled at us . " I 'll stay back here , " Manette said . Mimi pushed me forward . " Are n't you coming too ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was there to be afraid of ? Entering the shade of the verandah , I was surprised how small the old woman was , not much bigger than Manette . Her loose black skin hung from her neck . She held a shell bowl in one hand  --  pigs ' knuckles and coconut , it looked like  --  and was eating it with her fingers . She threw a bone to the puppy to finish . The old woman and Mimi began talking in the African tongue . I looked back over my shoulder . Manette was standing by a calabash tree , watching . A crow called out warning sounds . Mimi touched my arm . " She says your future is all around you . " " What does that mean ? " The old woman went into the shack . She returned with a basket which she pushed into my hands . In the basket were a gourd rattle , a wooden doll , a stick , two candles , a bone , bits of frayed ribbon and a crucifix . The old woman said something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , " Mimi told me . " Anything ? " I took a candle , the doll and the crucifix out of the basket . " She wants you to put them down , " Mimi said . " In the dirt ? " The old woman began chanting . I looked to see if Manette was still by the calabash tree . I shrugged at her . I remember thinking : See , there is nothing to fear . The old woman began to moan , rolling her head from side to side , the whites of her eyes cloudy . Then she looked at me and screamed  --  a sound I will never forget , not unlike a pig being stuck . " What is it ! " I demanded . I was not without fear . " Mimi ! Why is she crying ? " The old woman was shaking her head and mumbling . Finally she spoke , slowly , but strangely . " You will be unhappily married . You will be widowed . " I put my hand to my throat . The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying out words I could not understand . " Mimi , what is she saying ! " The old woman began to dance , singing with the voice of a man . I backed away , stumbling over a gnarled tree root . I fell in the dirt and scrambled to my feet . You will be Queen , she said . Copyri ght 1995 by Sandra Gulland
