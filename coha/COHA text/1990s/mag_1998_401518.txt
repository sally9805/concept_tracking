New , wooden clothespins , with their smoothly finished surfaces , are the nicest kind of material for craft work . You can build many toys with them and the work is lots of fun ! Eighty clothespins will be a good-sized " lumber " pile for building a fort . We shall build a log bridge first . Then we will set up a stockade such as pioneers of this country used for protection against Indians . Inside of the stockade we will build a blockhouse . Log Bridge 1 . To build the bridge shown in Figure 1 , cut a strip of thick cardboard 11/4 inches wide and 6 or 7 inches long . Corrugated cardboard from a box is best . 2 . Slip the clothespins over the edges of this supporting strip , first one on the right edge , then one on the left , then another on the right , as shown in Figure 2 , and so on until the entire length of the strip has been covered . 3 . Bend the cardboard to give it the arch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the bridge to represent water . Stockade The stockade shown in Figure 3 is built in the same way as the bridge . However , a longer strip of cardboard is needed to support the clothespins . Cut it 12 or 14 inches long so that it will reach from corner to corner of the stockade . To save clothespins , you may build only two sides to the stockade . Blockhouse 1 . The blockhouse is built in sections . Figure 4 shows the first story Build four walls like the one in Figure 5 . Cut a strip of cellular ( corrugated ) cardboard 11/4 inches wide to support the sides . Slip clothespins over this strip , placing them on the right and on the left as you did with the stockade . But let the heads project about 1/8 inch as shown . Make the walls five clothespins high . 2 . When you have built the four walls , place the ends together so that the projecting heads will interlock , as shown in Figure 4 . If you find that the walls do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the clothespin ends . // 3 . Cut a piece of cardboard 6 inches square for the second floor , as shown in Figure 6. 4 . Then build the second story . Figure 8 shows a second-story wall . Each wall is made in the same way that the first-story walls were built , but the walls must be longer . The way to make them long enough is to make the heads project 2 1/2 inches on either side of the cardboard strip . 5 . When you have built the four walls , interlock the ends of the clothespins and tie them together with rubber bands . 6 . Cut another piece of cardboard 6 inches square for the base of the roof , as shown in Figure 9 , and build the roof upon it with four triangular pieces of cardboard . A full-size pattern for the roof pieces is shown in Figure 10 . This pattern has been drawn across the page , partly in dotted lines . // 7 . Make a tracing of the pattern and cut it out . Then mark out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 8 . To assemble the roof , fit the four pieces together as shown in Figure 11 . Then join them with masking tape or strips of paper glued over their edges , as shown . The fourth strip of tape or paper will bring together the edges of the first and fourth roof pieces , completing the shape of the roof . It will not be necessary to fasten the roof to the walls . <p>
