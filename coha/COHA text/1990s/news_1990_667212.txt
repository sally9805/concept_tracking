<p> Wistful tales of 100-pound salmon are making their way up Washington 's Elwha River . <p> Fish stories ? Not if two concrete dams that churn water to power a pulp mill near Olympic National Park are removed - an estimated $ 20- to $ 80- million task - American Indians and environmentalists say . <p> The Elwha and Glines Canyon dams are but two of many targets in one of the most contentious water fights in the history of hydrolectric power . <p> Reason for the fuss : Operating licenses on some 200 aging hydroelectric dams expiring between 1990 and 1993 . For the first time since the dams were built 20 to 50 years ago , people can have a say in what changes should be required as operators seek new licenses . <p> " This represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to improve some of the country 's most popular and most valuable rivers , " said John Echeverria of American Rivers , a conservation group based in Washington , D.C. <p> Weighing in with opinions : Hydropower operators , farmers , environmentalists , homeowners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are weighed when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decides whether to issue new licenses for up to 50 years . <p> " These dams have been genocide to the resources and watershed and what it was intended to provide , " said Rachel Kowalski , member of the fishing- dependent Lower Elwha Klallam tribe and fisheries manager . <p> Elsewhere , issues are equally fervent : <p> - American Rivers wants to see the 154-year-old Edwards Dam on Maine 's scenic Kennebec River torn down so that prized Atlantic sturgeon runs can be restored . <p> Negotiations that would have seen the 1,000-foot-wide by-40-foot-high dam removed in 2000 broke down last month between owner Edwards Manufacturing Co. and state officials . Now , Edwards Manufacturing plans to seek a 30-year relicensing to generate six times more power at the dam . <p> - White-water rafters lured to western Massachusetts ' Deerfield River at the height of summer often meet " a creek about to dry up , " said Bruce Lessels , owner of Zoar Outdoor in Charlemont , Mass . " People come out to the river , they see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lessel says New England Power Co. , owner of eight dams along 73 miles of the Deerfield , does n't need to lower dams , just raise water . The company is trying to compromise . " But we generate based on the need for electricity , not on the need for recreation , " said Leo Sicuranza , New England Power 's environmental affairs officer . " We need to balance the recreation benefits with all the other benefits . We do n't want to solve one problem to create another . " <p> - Some 300 bird species - including threatened whooping cranes and bald eagles - have lost much of their wetlands habitat along 250 miles of Nebraska 's Platte River . After the Kingsley Dam and three diversion dams were built across the Platte for power and irrigation , it went from a shallow , 5,000-foot wide waterway , to just 1,000-feet-wide with vastly fluxuating levels . <p> - Residents along the Wisconsin River - where Wisconsin Valley Improvement Project operates 21 dams - want to tame wildly varying reservoir levels behind dams so they can boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Few believe rivers can be restored to original states . " It 's not going to be a pristine system again , " said John VanDerwalker of the Platte River Maintenance Trust . <p> Sharon Hyland of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said changes will be required at many of the dams that remain in use . " When most projects were licensed , there was not the emphasis on environmental issues that we have now , " she says . <p> Dam improvements may include switching water release schedules , upgrading power plants , cleaning contaminated sediment and building passages so fish can easily migrate upstream and downstream . <p> But changes can be costly and may diminish power generation at a time when U.S. energy policies are under scrutiny - particularly the dependence on Persian Gulf oil . <p> " Hydropower is on the side of the angels . It 's a 100-year-old technology , one of the most efficient and one of the least expensive , with multiple benefits : recreation , flood control , power , " says Barbara Flynn of the National Hydropower Association in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakdown of the number of hydroelectric dams up for relicensing and the percentage of each state 's power generated by dams : Dams up Hydro- State for review power Ala. 2 14.7% Alaska 0 20.1% Ariz. 0 23.3% Ark. 0 8.3% Calif. 4 19.2% Colo. 7 6.6% Conn. 2 1.2% Del. 0 0.0% Fla. 0 0.0% Ga . 12 4.7% Hawaii 0 0.0% Idaho 0 100.0% Ill. 2 1.0% Ind . 0 0.0% Iowa 0 4.7% Kan. 0 0.0% Ky. 0 5.0% La. 0 0.0% Maine 29 26.6% Md. 1 6.0% Mass. 5 1.0% Mich. 28 1.0% Minn. 15 2.5% Miss . 0 0.0% Mo . 2 3.9% Mont . 1 52.5% Neb. 0 8.3% Nev. 1 18.0% N.H. 10 17.9% N.J. 0 11.6% N.M . 0 1.0% N.Y . 37 25.1% N.C. 2 8.3% N.D. 0 9.6% Ohio 0 0.0% Okla. 0 9.6% Ore . 3 89.9% Pa. 0 1.0% R.I. 0 0.0% S.C . 7 8.3% S.D. 0 86.1% Tenn. 0 16.2% Texas 0 1.4% Utah 5 4.1% Vt. 13 16.6% Va . 9 71.0% Wash . 4 86.1% W.Va. 2 1.0% Wis. 61 3.4% Wyo. 1 1.9% Source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : CONCERNED : ' Our culture and heritage were taken away , ' says Lower Elwha Klallam tribe member Rachel Kowalski.
