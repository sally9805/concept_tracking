<p> Vince Foster 's ' depression ' <p> With a fatalism that struck me as odd at the time , President Clinton asserted after his childhood friend Vince Foster 's death : " No one can ever know why this happened . " The death , Clinton said , was a " mystery . " <p> Hillary Clinton , Foster 's longtime law partner and friend , told someone after the suicide : " Of a thousand people , of those who might commit suicide , I would never pick Vince . " ( This from Sidney Blumenthal in the Aug. 9 " New Yorker " ) . <p> But the no-one-can-ever-know phase soon gave way to reports that Foster was overworked , losing weight , acting strangely , not sleeping , angry , upset about the White House travel office mess , unfit for the capital , stung by the press , concerned that he 'd done a bad job as deputy White House counsel . <p> ( His job , incidentally , was a tricky one . It included investigating Supreme C ourt nominees , acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House decorators ' bills , and more . ) <p> It 's now being widely asserted that a motive has been established : mental illness , specifically depression . Many commentators have used the word . Two psychiatrists who did n't know Foster virtually diagnosed his condition in Thursday 's New York Times as " major depression . " <p> This diagnosis seemed a bit likelier following the release of all but one mysterious piece of a torn-up note Foster wrote . The note sounded bitter , lonely , agitated , put-upon . <p> So perhaps that 's that . Maybe the no-one-can-ever-know phase is now inoperative . <p> But I 'm still puzzled . <p> Do we have enough evidence yet to feel confident that Foster was suffering from suicidal depression ? <p> And apart from his note ( which sounded as " depressed " as millions of non-suicides feel every day ) , what are the sources of the evidence for suicidal depression ? <p> Foster 's widow ? The Clintons ? Other intimates ? Foster 's doctor in Little Rock ? His boss , White House counsel Bernard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearsay and suggestion and unattributed tales . <p> Had Foster been subjected to unusual criticisms ? By his standards , yes . He was n't accustomed to the sort of journalistic-political attack The Wall Street Journal subjected him to . And Foster was unusually sensitive about a lawyer 's " reputation " ( his word ) . <p> But was he catching hell from Nussbaum , too ? From Bill ? From Hillary ? <p> The president has spoken of his last conversation with Foster as a 20-minute phone call , mostly about business , the night before Foster 's death . But I 've seen nothing about Foster 's last conversation with Hillary . When and where did that take place , and what was its nature ? <p> Another friend of Foster - Associate Attorney General Webster Hubbell , who was a former law partner and friend of Hillary , too - reportedly did sense something wrong and invited the Fosters on a Maryland holiday to cheer him up . Did **29;252;TOOLONG partner Hillary sense the same thing ? <p> Did Foster speak to any of these people about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm thinking of financial , legal , romantic and medical problems ; of delusions ; of a relatively rational desire to avoid some looming public shame , or a feeling of impossibly conflicted loyalties . <p> People kill themselves for reasons in addition to " major depression " - to avoid physical pain , to gain heaven or honor , to let someone collect the insurance , etc . <p> Some say we should let the poor man rest . If only we could . Foster sounds like a person of real integrity . It also seems quite possible that he really was mentally ill . <p> But there is more than curiosity at work in the media 's poking around . <p> Foster , in his torn-up note , made allegations of serious wrongdoing by the press , the White House , the FBI and others . Foster 's boss , Nussbaum , has been accused of removing evidence . And the evidence for the theory that Foster was suicidally depressed remains thin . <p> There 's another reason to keep digging . The Clintons were Foster 's close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be none of our business - it may be more relevant to history than to politics - but a multiple tragedy in the White House is no small thing . <p> The mystery of C. Dickens <p> I 've sometimes wondered why the prices at C. Dickens , a rare-book store in Lenox Square , seem very high . So I talked with the owner , Tom Hamm . <p> A mystery turned into several . <p> One <p> Hamm says his prices are not high . " There is a market value for them , " he said of old books and first editions . His prices are within the usual scale - and " frequently at the lower end of it . " <p> Truly ? $ 15,000 for a limp first issue of Hemingway 's " The Sun Also Rises " in a chipped dust jacket ? $ 750 for a faded copy of " The Great Gatsby " with no dust jacket ? $ 3,750 for GWTW in an ordinary second-state dust jacket ? <p> The store 's prices are in these and many other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Book Prices Current , " " Bookman 's Price Index , " " Collected Books " by Allen and Patricia Ahearn and other conventional sources . <p> Two <p> Employees at C. Dickens do n't talk like the employees at other rare book stores . Whenever I enter C. Dickens , I sense a tension between the cost and rarity of the books , on the one hand , and the staff 's introductory patter about what a " rare " or " collectible " book is , on the other . <p> But Hamm set up shop in a shopping center - something unusual in the rare-book business because of high rents and the kinds of customers who pass by . <p> In any case , business is " excellent , " Hamm says , " way up over last year , " and the store has " millions of dollars " worth of books . It uses scouts and computers to search for " tens of thousands of titles " from " eight or nine thousand sources , " and it has " specialist " customers as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they really do n't know what that is . " <p> Three <p> Theft has been a problem , Hamm says . <p> In 1991 , for example , a former employee of C. Dickens was arrested after she sold some of its books to other rare-book dealers . She later agreed to restore the value of the books . <p> Hamm says he has been robbed several times . And this year a man named Robert Schraeder ( never an employee ) was arrested and charged with receiving stolen property after he allegedly sold several valuable books that turned out to have been stolen from C. Dickens . <p> " He said he bought them from a guy he met at an antique store , " Atlanta Detective Ken Cullifer told me . <p> Only a few of the books C. Dickens subsequently reported stolen have been recovered , Cullifer said . About 30 others have not . <p> Hamm says security at the store has been greatly tightened . <p> Anyway , he has some beautiful old books . <p> Colin Campbell 's Diary appears Sundays and Wednesdays in @ @ @ @
