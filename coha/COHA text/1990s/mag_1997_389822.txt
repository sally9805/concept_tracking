There 's no doubt about it-you 're bony . Photograph // But billions of years ago , all creatures were soft and slippery and there was n't a bone in sight ! Scientists ca n't tell us why things got so bony , but they can tell us that over thousands of years new characteristics , such as a little more fur or a slightly different colour , will pop up from time to time . About 450 million years ago , a bit of bone just happened to appear in the skin of an animal . This slightly bony skin helped the creature survive long enough to reproduce and have slightly bony babies ! Many animals today still have this suit of armour : For instance , crocodiles have bony plates just beneath their skin , and a tortoise 's shell is actually made of bone . Scientists still do n't know how our bones moved inside our bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , some fish-like creatures with a spinal cord appeared . Gradually , vertebrae ( backbones ) developed to protect this cord . One thing we do know is that an internal skeleton is handy . It lets you move about more freely than snails or worms can , for instance , and because it supports and holds up the soft parts of your body , it lets you grow bigger than most creatures without skeletons . Your ribs make a bony cage to protect organs such as your lungs and heart Your ribs are attached to the sternum ( breastbone ) and wrap right around you to join your backbone . There are 12 ribs on either side and the bottom two ribs are only attached at the back . How many vertebrae can you feel ? All together you have 33 . They go from your neck to your coccyx ( tail bone ) . Vertebrae protect your spinal cord , the thick " bundle of nerves " that runs from your brain , down your back .
