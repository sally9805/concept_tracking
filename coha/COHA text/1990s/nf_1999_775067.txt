When I was nine years old and growing up in Hartford , Connecticut , a city that I knew from the age of four would not be the city of my life , my aunt Harriet , my mother 's sister , a maiden lady as well as a former Catholic nun who quit the convent  --  a subject that fascinated my brothers , sisters , and me , although it was a subject that was never discussed by my parents  --  took me on a trip out west that summer . Our first stop was Los Angeles . For me , it was a breathtaking experience . I had always been starstruck , one of those kids who preferred movie star magazines to baseball cards . I believed everything I read in them . I believed that Paulette Goddard did something unspeakable to the director Anatole Litvak under the nightclub table at Mocambo . I believed that Louis B. Mayer , the all-powerful head of MGM , had taken Paul Bern 's suicide note  --  " Forgive me for last night , " he wrote to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Jean 's hands and destroyed it before the police got to the scene . I believed that Lana Turner had been discovered by Mervyn LeRoy at the counter of Schwab 's , the famous drugstore on the Sunset Strip . // On the tour bus that took us to the movie star homes , I sat right next to the guide so I would n't miss anything ; actually I knew more about the stars than the guide did , although he knew all their addresses . For years afterward I could remember their streets and their houses . Shirley Temple lived on Rockingham in Brentwood , just a few houses away from where O. J. Simpson lived years later at the time of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman ; Deanna Durbin lived on Amalfi Drive in a house where Steve Bochco , the television mogul , later lived . Clark Gable and Carole Lombard lived in a house on the flats of Beverly Hills , right up to the time she was killed in an air crash while on a bond-selling tour in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Pickfair , behind ducal gates , but you could n't see her house from the street . Jean Harlow , who was soon to die at the age of twenty-six at the peak of her MGM stardom , lived in a big white movie star house on Beverly Glen . I remembered stuff like that . // We went to the Brown Derby for lunch and had Cobb salad , which was a specialty of the house . The Brown Derby was built in the shape of a derby . I already knew that Louella Parsons and Barbara Stanwyck often lunched there , but they were n't there that day , much to my disappointment . We went to Schwab 's , and I tried to imagine on which stool Lana Turner had been sitting when she was discovered by Mervyn LeRoy . Schwab 's was full of starlets drinking coffee at the counter , buying makeup , and reading what I learned were the trade papers , the Hollywood Reporter and Daily Variety . It was perfect . We stayed at the Ambassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One night we had dinner at the Coconut Grove , the famous nightclub at the Ambassador , where glamorous women wore evening dresses and gardenia corsages . Eddie Duchin 's orchestra played , and Eddie , who was in a white dinner jacket and had a deep tan , looked like a million bucks leading the band . The next day in the Ambassador pool , Eddie Duchin spoke to me . He was the first celebrity I ever talked to , and I can still remember the whole conversation . He told me I should put suntan lotion on my freckling shoulders . I was tongue-tied . I could only mumble , " Thank you . " Later I learned that his wife had died after childbirth . Eddie Duchin 's son , Peter , grew up to be a famous bandleader himself , as well as a friend . Peter 's second wife , Brooke Hayward , appears in this book during the time of her earlier marriage to the actor Dennis Hopper. // The rest of the trip out west with Aunt Harriet was a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had fallen in love with a place . I knew that Los Angeles was going to play an important part in my life . I also knew with the certainty of a child with a vision that the day would come when I would walk in the front doors of the houses I had peered at from the tour bus window . // Hartford was a terrible letdown after Los Angeles . My family 's position in Hartford then was perplexing to me , and I used to think that all of my problems would be solved if only I could be an Episcopalian . We were the big-deal Irish Catholic family in a WASP city . My brother , the writer John Gregory Dunne , once wrote that we 'd gone from steerage to suburbs in three generations , which was pretty accurate . A school was named after my grandfather , Dominick Burns , who made his fortune in the grocery business and later became a bank president . I always played down the grocery part of his life and played up the bank president part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never forgot that he had been born poor , and giving to the poor was a mainstay of his life . My mother and my aunt sometimes feared there 'd be nothing left if he kept giving away so much , but it was a source of great pride in our family when he was made a papal knight by Pope Plus XII for his philanthropic work for the poor of Hartford . My father was a famous heart surgeon , who had received medical acclaim for an operation on a twelve-year-old boy whose heart he held in his hand while removing a bullet . The boy lived . // There were six of us , two boys . two girls , and then two more boys . I was the second oldest . I was n't good at sports , causing early paternal consternation , but I was very good at cripple walks . I could keep my sisters in hysterics with my repertoire of limps , if you get the picture of the kind of kid I was . We lived in a big gray stone house with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next-door neighbors had a swimming pool , an unheard-of luxury in those days , especially in Hartford , Connecticut . We went to private schools , and to Mrs. Godfrey 's dancing classes , where the boys wore white gloves . We belonged to the Hartford Golf Club , the club of choice , where we learned to play tennis in the spring and to ice-skate in the winter . We had a country house for summers . We were venerated by the Catholics of the city but only tolerated by the Protestants . At the age of twelve I fell madly in love with a girl named Lydia Ingersoll . Her parents were old guard Hartford , with a governor in their background , and they lived in a great gray stone mansion on Prospect Hill . One Friday night Lydia gave a dinner party before Mrs. Godfrey 's dancing class . Her mother wore a blue velvet dinner dress and pearls . All the Irish maids , who wore black uniforms , white aprons , and little caps , beamed at me in approval . They were all patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a silver tray of lamb chops . It was a dilemma in my moment of triumph . Back then Catholics were brought up to believe that if you ate meat on Friday. , you would go straight to hell when you died . I was so tempted to take a lamb chop , but I did n't . I blushed fiercely , the brightest of red tones , and declined the lamb chops , shamefaced . Then Lydia , who had enormous grace even at age twelve , came to the fore and said to a maid , " Perhaps an omelet for Mr. Dunne . " // Irish Catholics did n't come into social respectability until after Jack Kennedy married Jacqueline Bouvier and became the thirty-fifth president of the United States . Consequently we were never quite accepted in Hartford society , which certainly was a factor in the hectic and aggressive social quest of my young and middle adulthood . I knew where I wanted to go , and I knew I was going to get there someday . // Later in life I heard from Lana Turner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mervyn LeRoy , as I had fervently believed in my childhood . It was only a publicist 's story put out by the studio . By then I understood things like that , creating appearances . I was to become quite good at it myself . // YEARS PASSED . IN JANUARY OF 1944 , at age eighteen , I was drafted out of my senior year at Canterbury , a Catholic boarding school in Connecticut , did six weeks of basic training at Indiantown Gap in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania , and was sent overseas on a troopship called the Mariposa out of Boston . I was shy . I stuttered . I was terrified . I went into combat . My closest friend from the day I went into the service to the day I got out was named Hank Bresky . He was a year older than me , had gone to Choate , and been drafted out of his freshman year at Yale . We stuck together like glue . The other soldiers in our battalion did n't hold us in high regard , referring to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from home came from Louis Sherry , lavender tin boxes of chocolates , and treats like that . Theirs always looked like loving-hands-at-home parcels , crushed boxes with Milky Way bars falling out . When we landed in England , we took a troop train by night to the camp we would stay at until crossing over to France . The train was buzz-bombed . You could hear the bombs coming down . Everyone was terrified , no one more than us , but Hank and I became hysterical with laughter . We screamed with laughter . We could n't stop . Every bomb brought forth more torrents of helpless laughter . We became forward observers with the field artillery of the Ninety-fifth Division . The highest rank I ever achieved was corporal , but our sergeant ripped my stripes off me and demoted me back to private  --  probably because I was scared  --  in a dramatic ceremony outside Metz . We were in the Battle of Metz , the Saar valley , Ruhr , and the Belgian Bulge . On December 20 , 1944 , during a retreat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hank and I rescued two wounded soldiers who had been left behind and carried them to safety , for which we each won a Bronze Star , a salute from a general , and a picture in the newspaper back home . Winning a medal was the only thing I can ever remember doing that won any admiration from my father , with whom I had had a constantly stressful relationship , having to do with manliness , from earliest childhood until the very day I left for the army , when we parted without speaking . An early cleverness at repartee had long been silenced within me by his mockery . The experience of war was so overwhelming that I could not discuss it for years afterward . Forty years later I ran into Hank Bresky at the counter of Oscar 's , the coffee shop at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York . He recognized me before I recognized him . Seeing Hank again brought forth all the suppressed memories of that astounding period of my life . We talked without stop for four hours , sitting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first time I ever put into words the extent of the fear that I had felt the whole time , even when we laughed so hard . It was the first time I ever put into words the astonishment with myself that I had had the physical strength to carry a dying soldier for quite a long way . I remembered for the first time in years that the man had squeezed my fingers in thanks as we lifted him into a Red Cross ambulance . It was a chance meeting , which turned out to be valuable for both of us . Hank told me he had become very successful in life . I told him that I was n't exactly chopped liver . // After the war I went to Williams College in Massachusetts , where I acted in plays and yearned for a life in show business . In an early example of the coincidences that are a constant occurrence in my life , the sergeant who had demoted me before the Battle of Metz turned up at the Zeta Psi house , where I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served us lamb chops and peas at dinner . It was a private 's dream come true . But it was awful , embarrassing for both of us . We never spoke about what we had been through two years earlier . One night he vanished and was never heard from again . My father died during my freshman year , and we never had the obligatory talk that might have freed me from some of my demons of inadequacy that haunted my life for so many years . It was at Williams that I became friends with Stephen Sondheim , whom we used to call a genius even then before his fame . We were rival actors at the Adams Memorial Theater . We both tried out three times for the lead in Night Must Fall , the part that Robert Montgomery had played in the film . Steve got the part . Steve was already a prot ? g ? of the great lyricist Oscar Hammerstein , who recognized his talents before anyone else , and through Steve I was invited to attend the final run-through in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the opening night in New Haven of The King and I , starring Gertrude Lawrence and Yul Brynner , events so momentous that I can still remember the thrill of it all . Steve would say things like " Oscar says Gertie Lawrence ca n't hit the high notes , so they 're going to have to lower the key . " I loved to listen to talk like that . When Gertrude Lawrence died . Steve and I went to her funeral at St. Thomas 's Church on Fifth Avenue in New York , but an usher turned us away , recognizing us as mere fans . // In 1947 , between my sophomore and junior years at Williams , I talked my mother into letting me spend the summer in Guatemala , ostensibly to learn Spanish , but I ended up spending most of my time at the country villa in Antigua , an hour outside of Guatemala City . of the young writer Gore Vidal . Gore was already famous from his novel Williwaw and about to be more famous with his second novel , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a friend named Andres Devendorf , a sophomore at Wesleyan University , whom I had met in the army at Camp Blanding , Florida , after returning from overseas . In retrospect , Andres Devendorf reminded me of Sebastian Flyte in Brideshead Revisited . He was a glamorous young man from a rich Venezuelan Catholic family who lived in New York , Long Island , and Miami . Through Andres I began to be invited to the New York debutante parties , where he was a popular figure . My father had disliked him , but nothing was ever said . Andres and Gore had known each other in East Hampton , Long Island , where both their fathers had summer houses , and a chance passing on the street outside the University of Guatemala on the second day of the summer term changed our plans for the entire summer . Gore 's other houseguest was the noted and exotic diarist Ana ? s Nin , more than twice our age , who wore her red hair in braids entwined in brightly colored yarn , magenta-and-lavender shawls , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sophistication of Gore and Ana ? s thrilled me . She talked openly , with details , about her love affair with Henry Miller , the subject of which was later made into a film . I had not read her books or even heard of her until then , but her theatricality utterly fascinated me . I loved listening to her stories . One night there was an episode in a neighbor 's swimming pool ; Ana ? s was doing a backstroke and I was doing a breaststroke over her , and no one had on any clothes . I wo n't go into details , but subsequently she autographed her book Children of the Albatross to me in this manner : " For Nick , Will you float me home ? Ana ? s . " I treasure it still . Committed though I was , I was also a natural-born star fucker even then , before I 'd ever heard the term . We went on to Acapulco , which was still a sleepy fishing village , with Ana ? s , where a younger fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was my first brush with literary celebrity and what I thought was the literary life . I loved it . I saw Ana ? s on and off through the years , usually in bizarre artistic circumstances . Once I happened to pass by as she was sitting in the window of a shop in Greenwich Village dressed as a Gypsy fortune-teller , with her hands on a large crystal ball , as part of an experimental movie a young male friend of hers was directing . Our eyes met . She winked in recognition , then went right back into her Gypsy character . Finally , just before the end of her life , she came to my office in Beverly Hills to meet my son Griffin , then in his teens , who was transfixed by her published diaries . He disbelieved my bragging that I had known her when I was only a few years older than he . She had cancer , was using a walker , had lost her hair , and was wearing a red wig braided with brightly colored yarn , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in 1947 . When she saw Griffin , who is very good looking , something extraordinary happened to her . For an instant she ceased to be old . Leaving her walker behind , she walked over to him and said , " You 're the same age your father was when I first met him . " // After Williams , through fortuitous circumstances , I landed a job at NBC in New York in the new industry of television . It was 1952 , and few of the people I knew even owned a television set . Starting with me at the same time were Arthur Penn and Delbert Mann , who went on to become great directors in films and television , and Bud Yorkin , who went on to become a great producer . I became the stage manager of Howdy Doody , which was then the most popular children 's show on television . I knew Buffalo Bob , Clarabell the clown , and Princess Summerfallwinterspring . I seated the kids in the Peanut Gallery , and my name was on the credits at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doody was where I learned everything about live television , but I yearned for drama and stars . Then Robert Montgomery , the former MGM star who had played opposite Garbo and Norma Shearer and Rosalind Russell , asked me to become the stage manager of his weekly anthology show , Robert Montgomery Presents , in which Montgomery 's old friends from Hollywood would fly in each week to star in an episode . Montgomery was a glamorous fellow who played backgammon at the Racquet Club on Park Avenue every afternoon , married the very social Buffy Harkness the second time around , moved in swell circles , and on occasion brought the duke and duchess of Windsor to watch the live Monday night telecasts . There was a pageboy in a blue uniform named Jack Schwartz , who kept guard outside Studio 8H during rehearsals and when the show was on the air . Years later he would show up in a different identity to play a role in an important episode of my life . Every Monday night at eight the program started with me on the floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balcony above , " One minute , Mr. Montgomery , " and Montgomery would call back , " Thank you , Nick , and good evening , ladies and gentlemen . " How I loved that job . // ( Continues ... )
