THE FIRST TIME I MET MY HUSBAND-TO-BE , I HANDED HIM MY RESUME . I WAS N'T LOOKING FOR A SPOUSE  --  JUST A SUMMER INTERNSHIP . BUT I ENDED UP GETTING BOTH , ONE FIVE YEARS AFTER THE OTHER . I 'M NOT SURE WHEN PROFESSIONAL REGARD TOOK ON A PERSONAL DEMEANOR . I CANT NAME THE MOMENT OUR RELATIONSHIP CHANGED FROM COLLEGIAL TO CONSENSUAL . PERHAPS IT WAS WHEN I NOTICED THAT HIS EYES MATCHED THE BLUE OF HIS CHAMBRAY SHIRT , OR THE AFTERNOON I DROVE BY THE OFFICE JUST TO SEE WHETHER HIS CAR WAS IN THE PARKING LOT . I KNEW IT WAS RECIPROCAL WHEN HE GAVE ME A TRILOGY OF TOM ROBBINS BOOKS , WRAPPED IN A ROAD MAP , AS A GOING-AWAY PRESENT BEFORE I RETURNED TO COLLEGE . " KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE NEWS , AND WITH ITS CHARMING , ALBEIT CYNICAL , EDITOR , " SAID THE ENCLOSED NOTE . " JUST BECAUSE HIS HEART IS COLD LIKE STONE DOES N'T MEAN HE IS UNAPPRECIATIVE OF A SMILE ON A PRETTY FACE . " I STILL HAVE THAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MEMENTOS OF OUR RELATIONSHIP  --  BOXES OF LETTERS , OUR WEDDING ALBUM , OUR SON 'S FIRST LOCK OF HAIR . So FINDING LOVE IN THE OFFICE SEEMS LIKE A GOOD IDEA TO ME . And I 'm not the only one . Most offices are awash in romance today . According to several recent studies , about 80 percent of employees have either observed or been in a romantic relationship at their workplace . In a recent marriage announcement in the New York Times , the groom , who had met his bride at work on Wall Street , took time out from the proceedings to tell an observer : " If we think our employees are n't having romances , we 're crazy . We need to come up with a productive way to deal with it . To say this ca n't happen is ignoring the reality of men and women . " Perhaps in this era , where singles are seeking full disclosure , it 's wiser to begin a relationship under fluorescent lights rather than moonlight or candlelight . Secrets are n't as seductive as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dangers of making the wrong choices in bed , along with higher expectations about compatibility in marriage . " Not being into the bar scene , I was more comfortable meeting at work , " said David Kamp , who met his wife , Karen , on the job at a defense contractor plant . " We had common ground to begin with ; we did n't have to create it . " The emerging awareness of love at the office reflects a whole set of changing rules and relationships in the workplace . Companies that find a way to accommodate love among workers may be fostering the psychological health of modern men and women . The approach could have a positive impact on the competitive health of the company itself . THE GENDER SHIFT WITH THE SEXUAL INTEGRATION of the workforce ( now 46 percent female ) , an increase in age at first marriage , and longer work hours , the office has become a natural place to find an intimate confidante , sex partner , or suitable mate . Sociologist Pepper Schwartz , Ph.D. , sees this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news is old news says Schwartz , professor at the University of Washington . " There was a time when men and women were linked economically as well as for emotional survival . Now we think of couples as just emotional units . But before that , they were a survival unit . Well , the world has taken another rotation , and we 're back to being economic partners  --  by preference as well as necessity . " Historically , few women worked outside the home until the late 1800s , and men and women seldom mixed socially after marriage . In the 1890s , women began to move into the workplace , albeit in subordinate roles . Even in the 1970s , 99 of 100 business travelers were men . It 's no wonder , then , that as women enter the workplace at higher levels , new ways of relating are emerging . Lisa Mainiero , Ph.D. , a management consultant and professor of management at Connecticut 's Fairfield University , began researching women in the workplace several years ago . She found tons of material on career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know was whether they should be dating the good-looking man in their office . It 's as if they were saying , " Now that we 're here , let 's look around . " Old codes of conduct have become as dated as the slide rule . The 1950s black-and-white snapshot of identically attired young male executives sitting behind rectangular desks , forming a work force that was easily defined and contained , has been replaced by an interactive , full-color CD-ROM graphic of diverse employee teams working in offices without walls . The gender revolution in the workplace has mirrored a shift in gender roles at home . Being economic partners on equal footing , and sharing similar work loads and job demands , brings interdependence to marriages . It takes the pressure off men to be the sole providers and gives women more rights and respect . LOVE IN A CORPORATE CLIMATE AS READY AS EMPLOYEES MAY BE FOR THIS NEXT EPOCH in the sexual revolution , human resource managers are agnostic about the value of romance at work . The prevailing corporate attitude has long been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of favoritism and nepotism , sexual harassment , and fatal attractions . For decades , the professional literature on love at work has focused solely on the negative impact of such relationships . Anthropologist Margaret Mead asked flatly in 1978 for " incest taboos " against dating in the workplace . " A taboo enjoins , " Mead wrote . " We need one that says clearly and unequivocally , " You do n't make passes at or sleep with the people you work with . ' ' " A former editor of the Harvard Business Review , Eliza Collins , declared in 1983 that when love blossoms between executives , it can " break down the organizational structure " and should be treated as a conflict of interest between the couple and corporation . She concluded that a senior manager should ask the employee least essential to the company to leave . Unfortunately , she admitted , that would most often be the woman . Where love has broken out , it 's often been on the sly , to avert such a punitive response . In the 1990s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tailhook in the hallway , and Disclosure on the big screen , company liability for employees ' sexual shenanigans is a major concern . " Companies are a lot more conscious about sexual harassment . Probably some companies have tightened up , " says Phillip Way , Ph.D. , professor of economics at the University of Cincinnati who , in 1990 , surveyed 121 executives about their attitudes toward workplace dating . Supervisors ' other concerns , he found , are favoritism and breached confidentiality . The fear is that when business talk becomes pillow talk , professional standards and secrets are sacrificed . So why is n't office dating verboten and flirting a firing offense ? Because corporate honchos have discovered a simple truth : You ca n't outlaw love . The new gender balancing of the workplace makes it virtually inevitable . As journalist Leslie Aldridge Westhoff , author of the book , Corporate Romance ( Random House ) , puts it : " Corporate romance is as inevitable as earthquakes in California . " Executives are becoming , if not enthusiastic , at least accepting . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine , three-quarters said romances between workers are " none of the company 's business . " And more than half said they 're seeing more married couples at the office than they were 10 years ago . These CEOs can breathe easy : When handled properly , experts say , workplace romances can actually benefit companies . Once employees get past the initial ditzy , infatuation stage of being unable to concentrate on anything except their new love , an office romance has been found to raise worker morale , stimulate performance , enhance creativity and boost productivity . Love transforms . It can turn recluses into socialites , grumpy critics into team players , and sloppy , disorganized employees into models of efficiency . Romances that have been encouraged and supported by colleagues can bring vicarious energy to the office . And if the lovers span departments , another positive can be improved communication and coordination between those departments . If the relationships turn into long-term commitments , companies can gain happier , more fulfilled , loyal employees  --  preferably with 30-year mortgages . " In most cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the day-to-day work habits of the participants , " found James Dillard , a Ph.D. , a professor of communication arts at the University of Wisconsin . " If performance at work is perceived to change , relationships are more likely to show positive change than negative change . " WHY WE GO FOR COLLEAGUES AN OFFICE PROVIDES THE PERFECT ENVIRONMENT FOR attractions to form . Coworkers have similar traits and goals , are familiar and accessible , and share in each other 's excitement , frustrations , and celebrations . It beats 1-900 chat lines and Aunt Nora 's offer of a blind date , at the least . Many of the romantic relationships forged in the office are long lasting . In fact , according to a 1988 study from the Bureau of National Affairs , more future spouses will meet at work than at school , social , or neighborhood settings . Taking a look at why we 're more likely to fall for colleagues , and the consequences of acting on those percolating emotions , may help us figure out whether workplace romance is worth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and benefits and then just say , " OK , I 'm talking about a partner for a significant portion of my life  --  I 'll dance it and take the consequences , " Way says . * Proximity . We fall in love with coworkers , well , because they 're there . The more you 're around someone , studies show , the more you tend to like them . And liking , if other conditions are right , can evolve into deeper feelings . Being near someone can be powerful on a sexual level , as well . You do n't get a chance to smell her perfume or notice those tiny hairs on the back of his neck otherwise . Propinquity can be either physical , such as desks being located near each other , or functional , as in working together on a project . It can even be occasional or incidental , such as running into him in the snack bar or elevator , or being sent with her to the same seminar . Repeated exposure leads to familiarity , which leads to trust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In one survey , 94 percent of the office romances reported were between employees in the same building ; 34 percent were in the same or adjoining offices . Close working conditions encourage shared confidences . When you get a call at work saying your apartment is flooded or your mother 's ill the person you tell first is often someone sitting near you . Computer message systems have taken functional proximity to a whole new level . Cyberspace pen pals can be floors apart , yet find common ground when linked by a mainframe . The New York Times recently profiled a couple who conducted a prolonged correspondence through interoffice E-mail before their wedding . The wife described the experience as " a wonderful combination of old-fashioned courting and , at the same time , up-to-the-minute technology . " Through extensive computer networks within companies , " bytes and blips have become yet another means for the endlessly inventive human heart to make connections , " said the article . And , computer courters claim , it 's safe  --  there 's no physical contact until an emotional connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be completely private ; employers have the right to monitor the message system . And clever coworkers can gain access to office mates ' mail . * Safety . We all know the free-wheeling , penicillin-resistant demons out there that have sabotaged the free-love generation . There 's not only AIDS but other sexually transmitted diseases . Then add the psychopath lottery ( pick your numbers and take your chances that the cute guy walking by at the beach is n't a Ted Bundy or Jeffrey Dahmer ) . And throw in the free-floating anxiety associated with our increasingly anomic society . Enter your coworkers . You 've seen the pictures on their desks , the relationship they have with their ex- , the way they handle pressure . You know their favorite foods , the kinds of jokes that make them laugh , the name of the dog they had in third grade . " We 're a highly mobile society . Work is the only community we have , it 's the main thoroughfare for our lives , " says sociologist Schwartz . " There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locate . In the workplace , there 's a sense of safety and familiarity . " It 's that old choice , the known vs. the unknown . Corporate offices have replaced singles bars as a prime mating market and are usurping churches , neighborhoods , social clubs , and family networks as the way couples meet . College is the only other place where we are brought together with so many like-minded peers . But since more marriages are delayed until after graduation ( the median age at first marriage is now 24.5 for women , 26.5 for men ) , colleague relationships are taking the place of coed mating . " Human resource offices may attempt to ban the notion , but men and women working together is a more romantic setting than a school campus , " says Bill Powers , a retired Belk Lindsey department store executive who met his wife at work . " Work actually serves as a natural courtship ground , because at work , communication is encouraged . An exhausting job performance over a period of time will remove the veneer from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are continually being sent and received . " * Similarities . We tend to work with people who are like us in many ways  --  similar social class , education and income levels , interests , attitudes , and values , with the corollary being that " like attracts like . " Mainiero , whose pioneering research led to a book on Office Romance : Love , Power and Sex in the Workplace ( Macmillan ) , says that because companies choose employees who fit into the corporate culture , they have , in effect , prescreened large groups of qualified romantic candidates . " In a way , the corporation has now taken the place of dating services . " Since her study of love in the workplace , Mainiero has received hundreds of letters recounting workplace dating experiences . " I found that there is a positive side . Until then , there had just been a negative impression , based on bad experiences with hierarchical relationships . " The advent of peer relationships has revolutionized love at work as well as at home . Office peers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coworkers who become involved generally admire each other as teammates first , lovers later . " Today 's office romances are very different than the " powerful boss seduces beautiful young secretary ' variety of the past , " says Maureen Scully , Ph.D. , who focuses on organizational work ethics as an assistant professor of management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan School of Management . " These are professional colleagues working together on intellectually stimulating problems . There 's the aphrodisiac of cooperation . " Workplace couples are as likely to have been irresistibly attracted to each other while troubleshooting a quirky software virus as dancing to an orchestral love song . Biologist Phil Crow , 46 , first met his wife , Janet , as she was dissecting the spleens of fetal mice in the northern Virginia laboratory where they both worked . " I was very impressed with her technique , " he recalls . " You have to realize the mice were the size of a bean , and the spleen was the size of a pinhead . It was amazing to watch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related , but others are surprisingly personal . Betty Ivra met her husband , Rod , at Harris Corporation in Melbourne , Fla . They were both new to Florida and eager to visit the sights . " At first , he was just someone to go to Disney World with , " Betty said . Then the couple discovered how much they had in common : They had previously lived within a mile of each other in the Washington , D.C. , area . And , in a scene right out of 101 Dalmatians , they had a matching set of golden retrievers  --  Angel and Roca . " They say people have dogs who are like them , " Betty said . " It was definitely a positive  --  here 's a man who likes the same animals I do . " * Arousal . Workplaces can be exciting , challenging , dynamic , stimulating , creative . Or they can be dull , rote , clinical , lonely , frustrating , and boring . Either way works to Cupid 's advantage . When the environment is intense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call . We become aroused due to job conditions but transfer those feelings onto the attractive man or woman working nearby . " Physiological arousal can come from a myriad of work factors , such as time deadlines , physical exertion , extreme temperatures , dangerous working conditions , competitive demands and other anxiety-provoking situations , and can be mislabeled as sexual or romantic feelings for an opposite-sex coworker , " says Charles Pierce , Ph.D. , professor of psychology at the State University of New York at Albany . He presented a study , " Attraction in the Workplace : A Model of Organizational Romance , " at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Society in July . In other words , work is a turn-on . You shower , dress up in a power suit , go to a place where you are valued for your ideas , energy , and ability to get things done . You hang around other people who are also at their best and brightest . Then you 're thrown into situations that get the adrenaline flowing . Office romances are especially common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together under intense circumstances , and sometimes depend on each other in matters of life and death . Hospitals , police stations , newspaper offices , and law firms are hothouses for love . L.A. Law , Homicide : Life on the Streets , and E.R. may turn up the melodrama , but some of those simmering sexy subplots are reality based . " You get turned on by competence , by being a team that wins , by being better together than separate , " says Schwartz . " That 's very erotic and compelling . " Conversely , romance can add spice to jobs that have become routine . Having a crush on a coworker can perk up an employee 's productivity , studies show . Romance brings emotions back into the cubicles of corporate sterility. * Perks . Workers often welcome a midday break from office routine and grow close to regular lunch partners . Project teams , already bonded by hundreds of late-night , stress-filled , deadline-driven hours at work , may also socialize after hours at parties and dinners . Architects Joe and B. Barnes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on several projects together in a New York firm but did n't start dating until they 'd been coworkers for two years . " There was a strong social group in the office , and we 'd go out for drinks , Mets games , the firm softball team , and parties on the weekends said B.J. " We were part of a core group of 10 to 15 people who were similar ages and had similar life situations , " said Joe , who was engaged to someone else at the time . When Joe 's relationship broke up , he found himself crying on B.J. 's shoulder . " One night , after we had drinks together , I went to get her a cab . I kissed her on the cheek , then I kissed her more passionately . The next day , I called and asked her out . " Some companies also reward top employees with business soirees , out-of-state conferences and conventions , health-club memberships , even cruises . Food , travel , and camaraderie forged through accomplishment and celebration can provide the backdrop for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held in check by a conservative corporate culture , business travel might suspend office norms and let the lure of a strange city and anonymous hotel rooms breathe life into boardroom fantasies . * Convenience . With workaholism striking , by some estimates , almost half the American population , a large part of employees ' lives is spent on the job . If each workday you put in 10 to 12 hours at the office , sleep for seven , eat for two , and commute for one , that leaves between two and four hours for everything else , including washing your underwear . For upwardly mobile singles compelled to work nights and weekends , finding someone you want to date can be a time-consuming , nearly impossible feat . " If I did n't date at work , " said Patty Walters , a single marketing consultant from Santa Cruz , Ca. , " I might as well not date . " With 60-hour workweeks , it 's difficult to understand how couples who do n't work together ever see each other . Co-worker couples can share commuting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than pick up the phone , and work on late projects together instead of stranding one spouse at home . Cyndi and Kevin Renckens , who met while working in financial services for Martin Marietta , share the half-hour drive to work twice a week . " Life gets so busy , commuting offers us a great time to talk and not have any outside distractions , " Cyndi says . They also provide emotional support to each other during the day . " Just seeing her at work can lift my spirit , " Kevin confides. * Biology . Employees are not only socially motivated but biologically primed to become attracted to coworkers . Hormones flow in the office as well as outside it . THE RELATIONSHIPS ON-THE-JOB ROMANCES INVOLVE VARYing degrees of intimacy , passion , and commitment . They may range from one-night flings to long-term marriages . But all have a sexual component , unlike the deep friendships , mentor relationships , and unrequited crushes that also develop at work . " An organizational romance exists when two employees have acknowledged their mutual attraction and have physically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dating or otherwise intimate relationship , " according to psychologist Herman Aguinis , Ph.D. , of the State University of New York at Albany . These office romances are far from platonic , and the participants do n't seem to have grasped the concept of delayed gratification : a quarter of employees say they 've had sex on the premises of the workplace . Another 18 percent claim having had sex with a a coworker during work hours . But there 's more to workplace romance than just sexual flings . To call a deep relationship that involves love and marriage potential an " office romance " tends to trivialize and oversimplify the phenomenon , finds Marcy Crary , Ph.D. , an associate professor of management at Bentley College in Waltham , Mass. , who is an expert on male-female relationships in the workplace . " Most of us have been socialized into thinking of intimacy and work as two separate compartments in our lives ; intimacy takes place at home , work at our place of employment . " But in a study of attraction and intimacy at work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For many , the realities of day-to-day experiences belie these rational arrangements of our worlds . " Indeed , in the 1990s , the proliferation of home offices and office romances are signs that the boundary between work and home is not as rigid or impermeable as it once was . The elements that Sigmund Freud , more than 50 years ago , said make up a healthy individual  --  work and love  --  have become overlapping spheres once again . Integrating the fragmented parts of our selves promises to bring emotional balance to our lives . And for singles , it 's legitimizing the only place left to look . MOTIVATIONS FOR HER STUDY , CRARY INTERVIEWED professional men and women , primarily in their 30s and 40s , about their experiences with attraction in the workplace . She received such a detailed description from one woman that she included it in her article as an exhibit : " First , I 'll find myself noticing something about his physical appearance . Then , I 'll ruminate over some personal data about him . The person may appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about himself , watch how he is with other people , perhaps get in conversations with friends at work about who 's cute or not , and think of him , perhaps giggling at his joke more . I 'll initiate more conversations with him . I may covertly pass on information about my availability . I move into a more personal state and seek contact with him outside the workplace . " Office romances tend to develop in predictable stages . From her interviews with more than 100 executive men and women around the country , Mainiero has identified four common stages : Fantasy . A sudden romantic interest in a colleague develops ; it may result in dressing up , daydreaming , and working harder to try to impress the potential lover . Honeymoon . The employees realize the attraction is mutual and act upon it . They go on a date , begin a relationship , and may be distracted at work , with eyes only for each other . Renewal . The relationship enters a stable phase ; concentration on work returns . The couple feels comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Climax . The couple makes a decision to head toward a long-term commitment , such as marriage , or to break off the relationship . There 's often a painful period of self-evaluation . As workplace couples negotiate such personal landmarks , they must also worry about their status as employee and coworker . About two-thirds of workplace couples try to keep their relationship a secret . But most office couples are known to be an " item " long before any formal announcement . While employees might prefer to keep their romantic involvement in quiet , colleagues tend to be incredibly sensitive to even subtle changes in the behavior of someone in their work group . After all , keeping attuned to the office 's hidden alliances is critical to employees ' corporate survival , and gossip can spread faster than a global memo . Even at work , everyone loves a lover . Coworkers tend to be most supportive of an office romance when they sense the couple is in love and headed for commitment , concludes Robert Quinn , Ph.D. , an associate professor of organizational behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 126 professionals , reported in Administrative Science Quarterly , Quinn looked at the " Formation , Impact and Management of Romantic Relationships in Organizations . " He detected three types of motivation : * Love Motives . Employees look for companionship or marriage . The couple tends to be monogamous , committed , careful not to let their work slip . * Ego Motives . Employees seek excitement , adventure , or a sexual fling . The trouble comes when expectations do n't match . * Job Motives . Employees seek advancement , money , power , or promotion . Coworkers feel cheated if the romantic relationship gives the employee an unfair advantage . Reports Quinn : " When two participants are perceived as being sincerely in love , the relationship has a different meaning than when the male is perceived as always looking for his next conquest and the female is thought of as being on her way up the organization . " DANGER SPOTS THE COROLLARY IS , NOT EVERY OFFICE romance goes smoothly and not all company couples are looked upon favorably . Hierarchical romances , extramarital affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource managers recite to support a skeptical view of workplace romance . Supervisors want things to run smoothly , and emotional issues can gunk up the gears with sticky situations and tangled obligations . * Dating the Boss . Supervisor-subordinate dating is the most hazardous to an employee 's reputation and career . These relationships , say researchers , evoke company censure , ill-will from fellow workers , and possible lawsuits . If the relationship breaks up , the lower status employee may be forced out of a job or feel emotionally unable to work for the ex-lover . If the relationship endures , jealousy and resentment among coworkers may surface . Coworkers who believe they were passed over for promotion due to such a relationship can claim " paramour preference " in court . When two peers are dating , status issues do n't come into play . But when a manager is sleeping with an employee he 's also supervising and evaluating , it disrupts staff morale and becomes a human resource director 's nightmare . " The main issue is not sex , or even gender , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal relationship would be two single peers in two different departments who have very different career paths . It 's cleaner that way . It will always raise eyebrows if an employee is reporting to their lover . There 's a fear by coworkers that power is being traded for sex . " Colleagues become alienated or envious , believing that they wo n't receive the same consideration or attention from their boss as his or her lover . Even if a lover is given a deserved promotion , it wo n't be perceived as such . Exhibit A is the well-publicized early-1980s relationship between president William Agee and his then-executive assistant , Mary Cunningham , at Bendix Corporation , a Fortune 500 maker of industrial and aerospace equipment . Cunningham , an MBA in her late 20s , was quickly promoted to vice-president for corporate and public affairs , then to vice-president of strategic planning . Rumors flew that the rapid rise of " Bendix Mary " was due more to her relationship with Agee than to her competence . Cunningham left the company , and later wrote about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " That I happened to be the most convenient pawn around was merely coincidental . My fortunes were inextricably tied to Bill 's . If he fell , I went , too . Probably my biggest error was ignoring all the warning signals in the name of duty or loyalty . " Nevertheless , the romance had a happy ending : The Agees were married in 1982 and commissioned an ice sculpture for their reception of two adjoining hands , symbolizing " the bonds of business partnership and matrimony . " As more women move into management positions , the boss in a hierarchical work romance is as likely to be female as male . The part of the hardened editor having an affair with a bright young reporter in the movie , The Paper , was played by Glenn Close , not Robert Duvall . Whatever the gender order , dating up the chain of command is the only arrangement that almost all companies , even the most liberal , firmly prohibit . Most companies have written policies banning supervisor-subordinate relationships and enforce them by transferring or even dismissing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a young crew here , most in their mid-20s , and I know dating happens . There 's no policy , nothing formal about it says Kelly Candelaria , a human resources officer of Ticketmaster 's Los Angeles office . " Except that there 's no dating your boss . " But if romances were so readily controlled , the whole issue would be moot . The fact is , bosses fall in love , too , consequences be damned . Mark , a grocery store manager for a large Florida chain who asked that his last name not be used , moved in with one of his cashiers . He had to switch stores and took a $10,000 a year pay cut . " I kind of admired that they made me move , rather than her , " he said . " But it 's taken me about three years to get back up to the salary I had then . " * Extramarital Affairs . About one-third of office romances are extramarital affairs , which tend to be uncomfortable for other colleagues . Coworkers feel caught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes angry about the impropriety of the situation . Both participants may find that they have damaged their careers by engaging in behavior seen as unprofessional . " Levels of tolerance toward affairs seem to depend on three factors , " says Mainiero . " How discreet the affair is , the motives of the couple having the affair , and the level of conservatism in the company . " She cites the case of a man whose wife had been committed to a state mental hospital who began an affair with a woman in his small real estate office . The other employees were pleased that he had found some happiness and supported the relationship . Wal-Mart used to prohibit dating between employees , if one or both were married , and fire anyone who committed adultery with a fellow worker . But after a New York woman , who was legally separated , was fired for dating a single coworker , she sued the company and won , although the company was vindicated in an appeal . Wal-Mart has since changed its corporate policy and ignores all dating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breaking Up . It 's always hard to do , but it 's even harder in the office . Continuing to see an ex-lover day-in , day-out can be torture , a constant reminder of the failed relationship . There 's no such thing as escaping into work . A coworker breakup can create a war zone in the office , with employees taking sides . Breakups also bring out the worst in people  --  and not uncommonly give rise to charges of sexual harassment , whether real or manufactured . The bitter residue left by personal rejection can translate into office fights and vengeful paybacks . One jilted lover continued to send computer messages to her ex-boyfriend that alternated between pleading for his return and threatening his job and new relationship . He finally made a printout of the harassing comments and took them to a supervisor , which was enough to stop the behavior . Mainiero suggests that both parties sign a contingency plan at the beginning of their relationship . Such a document should contain general guidelines for how to rationally handle a breakup , including agreeing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing to act professionally with each other as colleagues . " * Sexual Harassment . The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission defines unlawful sexual harassment as either quid pro quo ( job favors in return for sexual favors ) or environmental ( hostile or offensive work environment ) . The behavior must be unwelcome , deliberate or repeated , and result in economic or psychological damage . An office romance is distinguished from sexual harassment in that it is jointly desired . Mutual attraction can be fickle , however , and charges of sexual harassment may emerge later . " A lot of sexual harassment cases started with what at least one side said was a consensual affair , " observes attorney Carole Katz , a partner in the Pittsburgh firm of Reed , Smith , Shaw , and McClay , who specializes in employment law and works preventively with companies on the issue of sexual harassment . " The employer then gets dragged into a personal fight that usually involves one employee 's word against another 's about something that happened behind dosed doors . " On a cautionary note : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later file a sexual harassment suit against their former dating partner may be seen as less innocent , and the accused treated with more leniency , than in cases where there was no previous consensual relationship . In a 1992 survey , 98 M.B.A . candidates asked to judge a hypothetical situation of sexual harassment viewed the woman as more complicit , and the man as less guilty , if there had been a prior romance . Companies will go to great lengths to avoid sexual harassment suits , since they often involve moral scandal , negative publicity , and  --  more importantly  --  big bucks . The Navy , after the spectacle of Tailhook , put together a 64-page handbook full of rules and regulations for on-the-job conduct and , in fact , n have set up a toll-free " sexual harassment advice line " as an emergency romantic reference . In civilian life and in the military , those who find themselves interested in a coworker are proceeding with caution , in light of the new sensitivity toward sexual harassment . " Men are starting slower and are careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they might now : " Would you , could you , does this bother you ? " COMPANY POLICY Most companies take a hands-off approach to office dating unless the relationship interferes with work . In a 1991 survey by the Society for Human Resource Management , 92 percent of members said their company had no policy at all regarding love at work . " With the changing nature of the work force  --  opposite-sex work teams and working more days of the week  --  it 's human nature , " insists psychologist Charles Pierce . " How can you put a policy on it when it 's going to happen ? " " Employees have legitimate and legally protected private concerns , " says attorney Katz . " Society recognizes and encourages the right of employees to associate freely and to pursue personal relationships that do not affect their job performance . " When problems related to office romance do surface at work , companies are taking an increasingly progressive attitude . In the late 1980s , they proved more open to taking positive action , such as discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970s , when reprimands and transfers were more common . " Even no policy is a policy on this issue , " says Robert Ford , Ph.D. , professor of management at the University of Central Florida in Orlando . To ignore the issue is tantamount to approval , given employees ' social and biological inclinations . Only one company of the 245 Ford surveyed had formal policies against single employees dating each other . Just 2.4 percent had formal policies against married workers having affairs with other employees  --  although more managers said they would ignore the former more so than the latter . By contrast , 43 percent of the companies had formal rules about displaying nude pictures or obscene cartoons at work Ford is adamant that the mixing of love and work is " the beginning of a horror story . " He contends " companies are taking a chance on two out of three bad outcomes . The couple could end up hating each other . Or they could get married , which brings up the concern of nepotism . Or they could return to a neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do his " best to discourage dating at work . It inhibits a sense of professionalism and builds an indulgent company culturer . " How companies look upon love at work has a lot to do with how they look at workers  --  whether they see them as whole people with hearts and libidos intact or as cogs in a flow chart . The business world has long attempted to manage emotions by removing them from the workplace , under the illusion that " a healthy business personality is different from a healthy human personality , " says Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ellen Goodman . Indeed , observes the University of Wisconsin 's James Dillard , there were historical forces that desexualized the workplace  --  religious morality , the idea that workers must be efficient and logical , with control over their emotions "  --  the Mr. Spock model of man . But management s thinking has moved away from the puritanical notions that workers must be saved from their baser animal instincts . Today , says Dillard , the workplace has become more balanced in terms of gender and expectations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working together not just as machines but they are interacting . " The corporate culture  --  its personality  --  defines how companies respond to workplace romance . Companies that are slow paced , conventional , and conservative tend to discourage office dating , whereas fast-paced , dynamic , liberal companies take office relationships in stride . In the new , global economy , companies that are flexible and adaptable may well be the ones that survive . Anything that increases employee satisfaction decreases costly employee turnover . On-site daycare , quality circles , flextime , job sharing , holistic health plans , stress-reduction seminars  --  these are all signs that companies are becoming more progressive on social and family issues , because they have to . The social amenities a company offers , and a sense of community engendered among employees , already have become drawing points for attracting new talent in the most highly competitive markets , like that of software development . Companies that are progressive about social and environmental issues tend to have enlightened views about office romance as well . Ben &; Jerry 's , headquartered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on-site childcare , and winter solstice parties with subsidized hotel rooms so no one will drink and drive . " We expect that our employees will date , fall in love , and become partners , " says Liz Lonergan , human resources manager . " If a problem comes up , we encourage employees to let us know and we 'll talk about it . At Ben &; Jerry 's , we feel that people can be who they are . I 'd hate to think that it 's okay to be gay and be out , but you have to keep it hidden if you 're dating someone at the same site . " Even in settings as conservative as law firms , office dating is not uncommon . " You 're talking about people who do n't have anything but their job , " says partner Don Steele of employees in his Los Angeles law firm . With 80 associates in the firm , he says , dating is inevitable , but " very carefully done . " Sexual harassment issues are a concern , and attorneys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The relationships that do form , like the one between a senior associate and her coworker husband , tend to be " solid , not the spicy stuff on L.A. Law , " says Steele . Then there 's that ultimate arbiter of modern mores , Miss Manners herself , aka Judith Martin . She 's pro-office romance  --  within proper limits , of course . " I 'm in favor of having them conducted in people 's private time . If you want to give someone meaningful stares , and they 're staring back at you in a meaningful way , and it does n't disrupt the entire office , and you 're having a hot romance after hours , I wish you much happiness . " Long before women entered the work force and romance became an issue , the rules and roles of power were inscrutable and arbitrary . Favoritism and hidden agendas were established parts of the office scene . Deep friendships and old loyalties have led to many a questionable promotion or inflated annual raise . Female employees have long contended that promotions are handed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy-hour beers excludes women who are trying to find equal footing on the corporate escalator . The reality , says Goodman , is that there are " all sorts of political and personal alliances in the corporate power structure that are untinged by sex ? Love looks benign by comparison . <p>
