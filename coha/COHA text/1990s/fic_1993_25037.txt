 | " Mr. Chee is with the Navajo Tribal Police , " she said , motioning Applebee into the booth . " As you know , he does n't like seeing our part of the world made a dumping ground any better than I do . And he is used to listening , and keeping what he hears to himself . " " Tribal Police , " Applebee said , examining Chee . He smiled . " Do you know Sergeant Eddie Nakai over at Many Farms ? He sold me a silver pollen flask once . Very , very old . I sometimes collect the old stuff . " " I 've met him , " Chee said . That produced from Applebee a smile . " Are you assigned to this business ? " " No , " Chee said . " No . Just interested . " The Applebee smile disappeared . " Well , " he said , and hesitated , caught his lip between his teeth , released it , exhaled . " I 'll give you a rundown first . The bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington , everything is go in the Interior Department . Continental has its well-placed buddies , and your friend Zeck went back there last week to join in the lobbying . We 're told that the Bureau of Land Management has agreed to withdraw the acreage they hold from graz-ing  --  with a payoff to the leaseholders of course . That 's bad , but it 's what we expected . That leaves the Navajo Nation and Tano . " He paused , acknowledged the waitress standing beside him , and ordered a hamburger . " Coffee ? " " What kind of tea do you have ? " The waitress was a plump Navajo teenager from Two Grey Hills who had often waited on Chee since his TONY HILLERMAN transfer to Window Rock . She raised her eyebrows , puzzled . " Iced , " she said . " Iced tea . " " No . No . I mean what kind of herb tea . Do you have Lemon Zinger ? Almond Sunset ? Or any of those Celestial flavors ? And hot tea . Just bring me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Applebee looked back at Janet . " We also think we have some hope in Tano . Governor Penitewa is still favoring the idea as far as we can tell , but they have their election coming up in January and a lot of people in that pueblo do n't want that dump on Pueblo land . The governor can be beaten . There 's a way we can beat him . " Applebee paused . The waitress was still standing there , looking indecisive . " Just bring me a cup , and a pot of hot water , and any tea bag you can find in the kitchen , " he said . " How about here ? " Chee asked . " Will the Tribal Council approve moving that toxic stuff across our land ? " " Not so good , here , by the looks of it , " Applebee said . " Councilman Chester is working hard for the dump . We 're worried about that . " Chee was watching Janet . She said nothing , which pleased him . That was properly polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . City bred , city raised , Navajo only by her father 's blood . She had to learn what it was like to be one of the Dineh . He would help teach her . Happily . Lovingly . If she would let him . Applebee decided he was n't getting the expected sounds of support and approval . " Well , " he said , " let 's talk about Mr. Chester . " He looked at Chee . " Do you know him ? "  | " From Horse Mesa Chapter ? " Chee asked . " Jimmy Chester ? I know him a little . " " What do you think of him ? " Chee shrugged . " I 'm a policeman , " he said . " We do n't have opinions about politicians . " " How about your aunt ? " Janet asked . " The council-woman . " " She 's a former councilwoman now , " Chee corrected . " It 's allowed to have opinions about kinfolks . " " I just did n't want to say the wrong thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Applebee said . " Nope , " Chee said . " I can say I know he 's a big operator in the cattle business out in the Checkerboard . And the people I knew when I was working out of Crownpoint thought Chester was a jerk . " Applebee seemed relieved to hear this . " Well , " he began , voice lowered , " We hear ... " He stopped , and waited silently while the waitress deposited cup , saucer , tea bag , a large coffee thermos from which steam was rising , and a slice of lemon . He read the label on the tea bag , frowned , and made tea . " We hear that Councilman Chester is a consultant for Continental . " He looked at Janet and then at Chee . Clearly this was the reason for this meeting , the message to be delivered . It seemed to Chee more of a firecracker than a bombshell . But Applebee was checking their faces , looking for reaction . " Taking money , " he explained . " It 's probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be bad politics and he 's up for reelection in the spring . " Applebee looked surprised . " Really ? You think it 's legal ? "  | " I 'd have to check the tribal code . It prohibits councilmembers from voting on anything in which they have a personal financial interest . I doubt if it goes beyond that , but I 'll check . " Applebee looked disappointed . " So it would just mean Chester could n't vote on the dump issue . I was hoping we could put the son-of-a-bitch in jail . " " You have some evidence ? " Janet asked . " Do you know how much they 're paying him ? Any details ? He 'll be trying to get the Horse Mesa Chapter to pass a resolution backing the dump . The Tribal Council usually goes along with whatever the local chapters want in their own district . And if the people out at Horse Mesa know he 's being paid to sell them on the dump  --  well , it makes them suspicious . " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gestured disappointment with his hands . " Nothing you 'd call concrete evidence . " " Nothing he ca n't deny ? " Janet asked . " What 's your source of information ? " Applebee examined his teacup and ignored both questions . " I think I can get something , " he said . He sipped , thoughtful . " Something ? " Janet asked . Applebee smiled . " Something useful , " he said . " I think I know how I can get something he ca n't deny . " 711  | THE WAITER in the Dowager Empress had long since abandoned hope of freeing his best table for another set of diners . He was outside the kitchen door , leaning on the wall , sneaking a smoke and enjoying Flagstaff 's cold autumn air and the dazzle of stars overhead . At the table inside , Joe Leaphorn and Professor Louisa Bourebonette sat side by side . The assorted dishes of Chinese food on which they had dined were gone , replaced by a clutter of maps . " How about this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight to Hong Kong , transfer to Air China to Beijing . I want to do some work in the library  | there . About two days , maybe . Or three . You could either do the tourist thing , sort of get used to China and Chinese food and their way of doing things , or you could take a flight north from Beijing and see what you could find out about contacts in Mongolia . And I could join you because I have some stuff I want to get copies of there . Now these Chinese airline schedules are from when I was there three years ago , but it looks like ... " Leaphorn found himself only half-listening to Boure-bonette 's recitation of flight schedules to places that sounded totally unreal . He was looking at the top of her head , bent over the schedules . He was thinking that the hair was gray but looked alive . Clean and healthy . ( Emma 's hair to the very end had remained a glossy black . ) He was thinking , Louisa needs to get her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maps . Emma always balked at getting her eyes examined . He was thinking of how being alone in China 's interior held no terrors for him . It would be strange . Speaking not a word of Chinese would be a problem . But it would be exciting . Louisa had said arranging an interpreter would be no problem . Easy but expensive . So what ? What else did he have to spend his savings on ? Professor Bourebonette looked up at him and smiled . " That sound all right ? We can always change it . " " Sounds fine , " Leaphorn said , thinking , Dilly Streib was right . She is a lovely lady . Thinking of what Dilly had implied about sex with her . Thinking of all the things she was doing for him ? taking him along as dead weight on this trip . What did he owe her for that ? What would she expect ?  | The waiter appeared at Leaphorn 's shoulder , smelling of cigarette smoke . " Anything else I can get you ? Refill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leaphorn said . " Louisa ? " Professor Bourebonette gathered up her maps . " I think we 'd better go , " she said . " If you 're driving back tonight . Do you have to ? " " I have a lot of work to do , " Leaphorn said . Actually , he did n't intend to go home . He 'd spent four hours on the highway this afternoon . That was enough . He was tired . There was a Motel 6 on the way out that always had a vacancy once the tourist rush was over . " I have a guest room , " Bourebonette said . She laughed . " Or something I call a guest room . Anyway , you 're welcome to use it . You 're tired . That 's almost two hundred miles from here to Window Rock . " " Two hundred and eighteen , " Leaphorn said . She was studying his expression . Her own was whimsical . " I guess ? " she began , then shook her head . " Think how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interstate and run into somebody and kill yourself . " " I could get a motel room , " Leaphorn said . " I do n't want to be any trouble . " " Thirty-five bucks . Or probably forty-five these days . Just think how much that money would buy out there in Mongolia . " And so Joe Leaphorn 's GMC Jimmy followed Professor Louisa Bourebonette 's little Honda Civic to her house . It stood on a narrow street only four blocks from the campus of Northern Arizona University , a brick bunga-  | low , aged and small . The guest room was also small ? very small , and crowded with a small couch , a work table , chair , computer , printer , supplies , books , odds and ends . Everything , it seemed to Leaphorn , except a bed . " The couch folds out . Just grab those tabs at the bottom and pull . I think it 's already made up , " she said , disappearing back into the hall . " But I 'll have to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converted itself into a thin , narrow bed . It looked lumpy and uncomfortable under a fresh white sheet . Professor Bourebonette 's voice came through the doorway . " How about a glass of wine first ? Make you sleep . " There was the sound of things being moved . " Sorry . I forgot . How about a cup of tea then ? I have a box here of something called Sleepytime . ' " " Fine , " Leaphorn said . " Although I do n't think I 'll need it . " He sat in a well-worn recliner in the living room and looked at a framed print of a Georgia O'Keeffe landscape on the wall across from him  --  a landscape of red and black erosion . Probably near Abiquiu , he thought , but it could have been done a thousand places on the Big Rez . He shifted in the recliner , relaxing , comfortable , glad he had n't gone to a motel . What would be would be . In the kitchen , a teakettle began to whistle . Cups clattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old groove . This was when he did his best thinking  --  just before sleep . He would review whatever puzzle was bothering him , turn the facts over and over , look at all sides of them , knock them together , and then explain it  | all to Emma  --  as much to organize it in his own mind as to ask her opinion . But her opinion was often wise . Louisa Bourebonette appeared carrying a tray . Two saucered cups , a steaming teapot , a little pitcher of cream . She put the tray on the table beside Leaphorn 's recliner , handed him his cup , dropped a tea bag into it , poured in hot water . " I would have offered you coffee , but I 'm out of decaf . And you should n't be drinking the high-octane stuff this late . " " This is fine , " Leaphorn said . " Better for me . " " It really is , " she said , perching on the sofa across from him with her own cup . " Especially this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Leaphorn said , and found himself surprised as he said it . " Puzzles ? " " I 'm working with an officer named Jim Chee , " Leaphorn said . " You met him last summer . " " I remember Jim , " she said . " He 's my assistant now . Brand new . Just started . We 're working on an odd case together . " He paused , watching her expression . " It 's a homicide . Somebody killed a teacher out at a mission school on the Checkerboard Reservation . " He paused again . " Go on , " she said . " I 'm waiting for the puzzle . " " It may not really be a puzzle , " he said . " Just a little oddity , probably . But , being a Navajo ? " He grinned at her . " I have to start at the beginning . " " The perfect place , " she said . " Two cases , " he said . " Two incidents . Unconnected . But are they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Eric Dorsey , the telephone tip , the circumstances that had led to the arrest of Eugene Ahkeah , and his denial of the crime . " Sounds like no mystery there , " she said . " Exactly , " Leaphorn said . " It sounds typical of the homicides we work on on the reservation . Too much whiskey . " " And that , I 've guessed , is why you do n't drink wine , " she said . Leaphorn sipped his tea . " Then , a day later and a long ways off at the Tano Pueblo , we have another homi-cide . " " I read about that one , " she said . " The koshare killed at his kiva right in the middle of a kachina ceremonial . Created quite a sensation . Nothing like that had ever happened before . " " That one 's not our case and I do n't know everything about it . But from what I do know , they do n't have a suspect , or a motive , or anything much to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the plaza where the koshares dress and rest and so forth . He hit this guy on the head and nobody saw a thing . " Leaphorn paused again , watching her . She sipped her tea , looked at him over the rim , put down the cup . " Go on , " she said . " If the story stopped there you would n't be telling me . " " It just happened that Jim Chee was there when the homicide took place , " he said . He told her about the effort to find the Kanitewa boy to keep his Navajo grandmother happy , and what had happened , and about Chee going back with Sergeant Blizzard , the cop from the BIA. 84  | Finally , he told her the connection Chee had made about the boy 's behavior after he 'd heard the broadcast report of Dorsey 's murder . Bourebonette picked up her cup again and sipped . " What do you think ? " Leaphorn asked . " Do n't rush me , " she said . " You 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your time . " " Right off the bat , I 'd say you picked a smart assistant . Pretty smart , Chee . Good thinking . Making the connection with the radio broadcast . " She paused , thinking . " Or was it hearing the broadcast that caused the boy ? what was his name  --  caused him to run back to see his uncle again ? " " Kanitewa , " Leaphorn said . " Tomorrow , when I get back on the job , we 'll see if we can find out . " " He 'll tell you ? " " Why not ? If we can find him . And unless it has something to do with his religion . " " I was thinking that . He 's a teenager . Old enough to be initiated , I 'd think . I do n't know much about Tano specifically . But I 'd think they 'd be like the other Pueblos . " " So would I , " Leaphorn said . " But how do you think the two things connect ? Kanitewa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five miles from Thoreau . " " What do you think could have been in that package ? The one Chee mentioned , wrapped in the news-paper ? " " We 'll try to find out tomorrow , " Leaphorn said . " Probably will . "  | " If it 's not something religious . " " Yeah , " Leaphorn said . He felt an intense urge to yawn , stretch . Instead , he settled deeper into the chair . " The trouble is , we do n't have enough details to specu-late . " " We can speculate anyway , " Professor Bourebonette said . " Maybe the boy had some way of knowing what's-his-name . The teacher who got killed . Maybe there was some connection between Kanitewa 's uncle and the teacher . What 's your theory ? " Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn did n't answer , having gone soundly to sleep in the recliner.  | JIM CHEE noticed a neat stack of papers in his in-basket when he walked into his office . He ignored them for a moment to stand staring out his window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a slightly larger one when he was transferred from Shiprock to Window Rock . From it he could look eastward at the ragtag southern end of the Chuska Range , the long wall of sandstone along which Window Rock had been built and which , because of the great hole eroded through it , gave the capital of the Navajo Nation its name . He looked out today into a windless autumn afternoon . No traffic was moving on Navajo Route 3 and a sin-  | gle pickup truck was ambling northward up Route 12 past the Navajo Veterans Cemetery . The trees at Tse Bonito Park were yellow , the roadsides were streaked with the purple of the last surviving October asters , and overhead the sky was the dark , blank blue . Chee exhaled a great sigh . Would she go to Gallup with him tonight ? She had neglected to answer that question . Or , worse , avoided it . Or , worse still , forgotten it . He sat behind his desk and fished the papers out of the basket . They were clipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat script and the initials J.L. I 'm going on an extended leave at the end of next week . Attached find items I 'd like you to clean up before then . The first item was the file on the Todachene hit-andrun case . It was relatively old now , old enough normally to be dumped into the suspense file . This one was alive twenty-five percent because of the inhuman callousness involved and seventy-five percent because it had caught the chief 's eye . Chee remembered most of it but he flipped glumly through the attached reports to see if the patrol officers had found anything new . Nothing had been added to what Leaphorn had told him . He put that aside and picked up the next one . Offering sergeant stripes for solving that one was sort of like the offers you heard about in fairy stories . You can marry the princess if you do something impossible  --  like putting a mountain in a pea pod . Flow in hell could you  | solve a hit-and-runner with no clues , no broken headlight glass , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of another parallel . How in hell could he expect to win the princess , a full-scale city girl lawyer , if he could n't make sergeant ? He 'd heard of the second case , too . Theft of an antique saddle and other artifacts from the Greasy Water Trading Post . Under that was one he had n't heard of  --  a series of fence cuttings and cattle thefts around Nakaibito . He flipped through the rest hoping for something unique or interesting . No such luck . The final item in the stack was another memo sheet , initialed J.L. Do n't forget to find the Kanitewa boy . Chee made a rude noise and dropped the memo back on the stack . Trying to find Kanitewa was typical of the whole list . What do you do ? First , you let everybody you can think of know you want a call if they see the kid . If he shows up at school , they call you . Well , he 'd done that . What else can you do ? . The same with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Call every place that fixes cars and tell ' em to tip you if somebody comes in for body work . Stake out the auto supply stores for somebody buying the right kind of right front headlight . Then , for the cow stealing , you do about a thousand miles of back-road driving around Nakaibito finding out who saw what and when , and who was eating fresh beef or drying cowhides , and The telephone rang .  | " Jim Chee , " Chee said . " This is Blizzard , " the voice said . " You still interested in that kid ? " " Kanitewa ? Sure . " Chee felt a mixture of surprise and pleasure . Blizzard was n't quite as hardassed as he 'd thought . " What do you hear ? " " He 's back at school , " Blizzard said . Chee let that sink in for an unhappy moment . So much for promises . That principal said he 'd call just as soon as the boy showed up . Chee could still see the man , shaking his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've got your number right here on the blotter . " The secretary had promised , too . So much for promises . " How 'd you know ? " Chee asked , trying not to sound bitter . " I 'm calling from the school , " Blizzard said . " Just dropped the little bastard off there . I found him near the bus station at Grants and I gave him a ride . " Chee did n't ask how Blizzard knew Kanitewa would be at the bus station at Grants . The Cheyenne had staked out all the bus stations where the kid might show up . Chee had n't thought of doing that . Maybe that 's why the Cheyennes beat Custer . " He was headed back to school ? " " He said he was , " Blizzard said , sounding sour . " That 's about all he did say . " Chee looked at his watch . " So he was going back to live with the Navajo side of his family . With his father ? That what he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Chee said . " Appreciate the call . I  | owe you one . Anytime I can be helpful . " He picked up the memo , wadded it , flipped it toward the wastebasket . It hit the rim and dropped on the floor . " Yeah , " Blizzard said . " How about right now ? " " Like what ? " Chee said . " I 'm city In-dun , " Blizzard said , picking up the Navajo pronunciation . " I do n't understand these sheep camp Ind-uns yet . Polite as I am known to be , I think I must say the wrong things sometimes . Not come on just right . " Blizzard paused , awaiting a comment , and , getting none , went on . " Back at the Kanitewa house at the pueblo , you got his mama to talking . You think you could get the boy to talk ? " " I do n't know , " Chee said . " Not if it 's anything to do with his religion . " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What I want to know about is what his mama told us . About why he was in such a sweat to see his uncle , and why he had to go back and see him the second time , and what he had in that package he brought for him . " " It must have been something long and narrow . Maybe something rolled up in a tube . Did n't you guys find anything like that in Sayesva 's place ? " " Nothing , " Blizzard said . He paused . " Well , hell , there was plenty of long narrow stuff in his house , you know . It could have been anything . " " And the boy would n't tell you ? " " Just shut totally up , " Blizzard said . " You asked him specifically ? About what he 'd brought for his uncle in the newspaper ? "  | " He said it had to do with his kiva . His religious outfit . Said he could n't talk about it . " " He wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't think you Cheyennes have that philosophy . We do n't either . Our religion is family and the more that take part in a ceremony the better it is . But the Pueblo people , it diminishes the power if people who should n't be involved in a ritual are told about it . Or see what they should n't . Or photograph it . He 's not going to tell me . " There was a long silence . Then Blizzard said , " Uh-huh , " in a tone which said a lot more than that . " Well , then , thanks a lot and to hell with it . " " Wait a minute , " Chee said . " I 'll have to get out there anyway . " He delivered a self-deprecatory laugh . " I 'm supposed to get him to call his grandmother . So when I get out there , I 'll see if I can get anything out of him . If I do , I 'll call you . " " Yeah , " Blizzard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Anything I can provide you ? " Blizzard finally asked . " I do n't think so , " Chee said , sounding puzzled . " You got my phone number ? " " Oh , " Chee said . " No . " " I did n't think so , " Blizzard said , and gave it to him . Chee copied it , read it back . " I 'll call , " he said . " Like about when , you think ? " Blizzard said . " Maybe today ? " " What 's the hurry ? " " The hurry is my agent-in-charge . I told him about , the two visits , and the package . And that got him all heated up . He has n't got another damn thing to work on  | in this case . So then when I found the boy and let him off at the school , I called the son-of-a-bitch . And I told him what the boy said . About it just being religious business . The package and all . And he wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , " Chee said . " Or bring the kid back to Albuquerque for him to question him . " " Fat lot of good that will do , " Chee said . He was thinking of the Grandmother Councilwoman , who would be plenty pissed off , and would pass it along to Leaphorn , who would ? Would what ? He had just worked for the man a few days . How would Leaphorn react ? " But I guess you do n't have much choice , " Chee concluded . " Well , some , " Blizzard said . " While I was talking to the feds in Albuquerque , the kid took off again . " " Oh , " Chee said . " Not again . " He was silent a moment , absorbing the disappointment . Back to square one . It did n't surprise him much . But it was interesting . So was Blizzard . Chee found himself thinking of the man not as a Cheyenne but as a cop new to the territory , not knowing the people , lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell you what , " he said . " You get yourself something to eat in that diner by the gas station , and then get over to the Crownpoint police station . I 'll meet you there . The lieutenant in charge is a man named Toddy . Try to be nice to him . It 'll take me maybe two hours , and if anything hangs me up , I 'll call you there . " " Done , " Blizzard said , and hung up . Chee put on his cap , his gun belt , and his jacket . He  | called the dispatcher and told her he would be driving to the subagency office at Crownpoint . He sat for a moment , thinking , then picked up the phone book and extracted the number of radio station KNDN . The woman who took the call was cooperative . She put him on hold for a few moments , and then read him the transcript of the six P.M. news of three nights ago . It included five items : the change in schedule of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runway of the landing strip at Kayenta , the death in the hospital at Gallup of the former chairwoman of the Coyote Pass Chapter , the replacement of the retired principal of the Toadlena school , and the murder of Eric Dorsey at the Saint Bonaventure Indian Mission . Chee took two steps toward the door . Then he turned and sat , cap , jacket , and gun belt on , typing a memo for Lieutenant Leaphorn . He had worked for the lieutenant long enough now to make it a long one .  | " HE SHOULD BE in just about any time , " said Virginia Toledo , examining Chee over her glasses . " He went to Flagstaff yesterday and he called a little while ago and said he 'd be late . " " Called from here ? " Chee asked . " Or called from Flag ? Or radioed in from somewhere ? " He was holding a folder in his right hand and his uniform cap in his left . Virginia Toledo had not yet decided what her relationship would be with Officer Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning . For the past twenty-three years her job title had been Administrative Assistant , Navajo Department of Public Safety , and she  | was , in fact , the workaday nerve center of the Window Rock operation . What 's going on ? Ask Virgie . Why 's Desbah not in his office ? Virgie will know . What happened at that meeting last night ? Get Virgie to tell you . Virgie knew exactly how to deal with everybody in the building , including Joe Leaphorn , Chee 's boss . But now this young Jim Chee was holding down that little office upstairs . She did n't know him . She 'd heard he was sometimes something of a screwup . She inspected him over her glasses . His tone had struck her as unduly demanding . He was a college man . Maybe he 'd been around white men so long he 'd lost his good manners . Maybe he 'd picked up the bilagaana attitude about women . She checked his expression , looking for some sign of irritation or arrogance . She saw only excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 're going to get excited , that was the age for it . " He called from his house , " she said . " Just about ten minutes ago . " " If he calls again , " Chee said , heading for the stairs , " would you tell him I 'll be waiting in my office ? And I need to see him . " He stopped , turned , and smiled at Administrative Assistant Virginia Toledo . " Please , " he said . " And thank you . " The door to Leaphorn 's office was about fifteen feet from Chee 's door . He tapped on it on his way past , got no response , tapped again , and turned the knob . Of course it was n't locked . He 'd heard it would n't be  --  that one of the lieutenant 's several idiosyncrasies was a refusal to lock his office . " If you have to lock your door in the police station , " Leaphorn would say , " then it 's time to get new  | policemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the department . Nobody locked doors at the Tuba City station either . Nor , come to think of it , at Crownpoint when he 'd worked out of there . Chee said , " Lieutenant ? " in a loud voice , and looked around . Neat , tidy , the desk top clear . No sign of dust . Dust would n't dare . In his own office , Chee reread his newly revised report . Blizzard had been waiting in the parking lot outside the Crownpoint station  --  sprawled across the front seat of his car , long legs dangling out the open door , head resting on his jacket folded against the passenger door , reading a book . The book , Chee noticed , had a dust jacket that looked science fictionish and bore the name Roger Zelazny . He had put it on the dashboard , pushed himself erect , looked at Chee and then at his watch . " I see you 're operating on Navajo time , " he said . Chee had let it pass and let Blizzard tell him what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the boy to wait at his car while he made his telephone call to Albuquerque . When he finished talking to his agent-in-charge and came back to the car , the boy was gone . " The school buses were loading up and leaving when I went in to use the phone . So I found out which one he 'd take to get home , and chased it down , but he was n't on it . Then I found out where he lived and went out to his daddy 's place . His stepmother was there but she said she had n't seen him since he took off the first time . "  | " So he did n't go home , " Chee said . " That 's funny . " " Maybe not , " Blizzard said . " When I picked him up there at Grants he was walking out toward the interstate . I did n't ask him where he was going . I just let him in the car , and he was in before he knew I was a cop , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to his school . " " So maybe he was actually headed somewhere else . " " I should have found out , " Blizzard said , sounding repentant . " He told me he 'd gone in the bus station to buy a ticket but he did n't have enough money . I figured the ticket was just to Thoreau . " " Probably right , " Chee said . " Maybe , " Blizzard agreed . " He acted nervous . I think I told you that . " " His stepmother . Did she give you any guesses about where he might be staying ? Kinfolks ? Friends ? " " She said she had no idea . Did n't have a clue . She was n't very talkative . " That had n't surprised Chee . He had stopped thinking of Blizzard as a Cheyenne and was thinking of him as a city man . Chee had concluded years ago that not many city people knew how to talk to country people . Delmar Kanitewa 's Navajo stepmother would definitely be country people . Blizzard had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school bus driver , " Chee said . That had proved easy . His name was Platero , he lived less than a mile from the school , and , yes indeed , he could tell them who was Delmar 's best friend . It was a boy named Felix Bluehorse . " Sometimes Felix gets off at his place , and sometimes vice versa , " Platero said . " Blue-  | horse used to go to school here , before he switched over to Thoreau , and we still give him a ride sometimes . They 're good buddies . " Even better , Felix Bluehorse 's mother worked for the Navajo Communications Company and lived in Crownpoint . Better yet , Felix was home when they got there and was anxious to talk to somebody . But first , he wanted to see their police identification . Felix was small and about sixteen , with enough white blood mixed with his Navajo genes to make him vulnerable to acne . He stood in the doorway of his mother 's mobile home looking down on them . Obviously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be careful who I talk to , " Felix said . " Somebody 's after Delmar . " He looked at Blizzard , then at Chee , savoring their reaction . Chee waited . They were in Navajo country , but it was Blizzard 's case . " Who ? " Blizzard asked . " Why ? " " The man who killed Mr. Dorsey , " Felix said . Abruptly , it was n't Blizzard 's case . Now it was Chee 's case . " You know what , " Chee said . " I think you have some very important information . Can we come in and sit down and talk about it ? " In the crowded Bluehorse living room it developed that Felix Bluehorse did have quite a bit of information , if one could only calculate what it meant . Chee was thinking of that now , going over it in his mind , reading through the report he 'd typed for Lieutenant Leaphorn , wondering if he 'd left anything out . If  | he had , it was too late to do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it opened , and the lieutenant looked in at him . The lieutenant looked old and tired . " Virginia said you were looking for me . " " Yes sir , " Chee said . He stood , handed Leaphorn the file folder . " You find him ? " " No sir , " Chee said . " Well , not exactly . Blizzard found him ... Leaphorn 's expression stopped Chee . It was a broad , happy grin . Chee hurried on . ... at Grants , and he picked him up and took him to Crownpoint . " Chee swallowed . " But he got away again . " Leaphorn 's grin disappeared . He tapped the folder . " It all in here ? " " Yes sir . " " I 'll read it , " Leaphorn said . His tone suggested to Chee that reading it would not have high priority . " It connects the Kanitewa boy to the homicide at Thoreau , " Chee said . Leaphorn took his hand off the doorknob , flipped the report open , scanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk in my office , " he said . But before they talked , Leaphorn eased himself into the chair behind his desk , put on his glasses , slowly reread Chee 's report , placed it on the desk top , restored his glasses to their case , put the case in his shirt pocket , and looked at Chee for a long moment . " What 'd you think of the Bluehorse boy ? " " He seemed like a nice kid , " Chee said . " Ile wanted  | to cooperate . Enjoying the excitement , somebody paying attention to him . Liking being important . " " He said he had no idea where Kanitewa was hiding out . You think that 's true ? " " Maybe , " Chee said . " I doubt it . I 'd bet he could give us two or three guesses if he wanted to . " Leaphorn nodded . " He told you that Kanitewa thought the man who killed Dorsey would be after him ? " " Right , " Chee said . " And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chee said , embarrassed . " I think he actually said Kanitewa told him it was a man he 'd seen at Saint Bonaventure Mission . You know , you 're dealing with a hearsay , secondhand description . He said Kanitewa said this man was medium-sized and kind of old . I think we just took for granted we were talking about a Navajo because he did n't say white , ' or Chinese , ' or Hispanic . ' " Leaphorn produced an affirmative grunt . He extracted his glasses , reread part of the report . " You say here Bluehorse said he did n't know whether Kanitewa had actually witnessed the crime . " " We pressed him on that . He said he was n't sure . Maybe Kanitewa had actually seen it . But he did n't tell him he had . I 'd say if Delmar had seen it , he 'd have said so . And he would have yelled . Reported it . " " Yeah , " Leaphorn said . " I 'd guess that when he heard the radio broadcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going into the shop and put two and two together . " Leaphorn nodded . " Could it be Eugene Ahkeah ? " Chee asked .  | Leaphorn said , " Big . Kind of old . That could be just about anybody . Could be Ahkeah . He 's not much older than you . But for a teenager , kind of old ' is anybody over twenty . " " And Ahkeah was there that day , " Chee said . " Other people saw him ? " " Yep , " Leaphorn said . He sighed , got up , walked to the window , and stood , hands in his pockets , looking out . " We 've got our man in jail , " he said , finally . " We 've got him at the scene . There 's no question he had the opportunity . We 've got a good motive  --  theft plus drunkenness . And we have physical evidence tied to him . All that stolen stuff . Now it seems as if we have another witness who must have seen something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The trouble is , I was thinking we had the wrong man . " " Why ? " Leaphorn shook his head , laughed . " Be damned if I know why . I used to think I was logical . Usually I am . It 's just that this Ahkeah seemed wrong for it . " He walked around behind the desk , rummaged in the drawer , and took out a box of pins . " Ever have that happen to you ? Your brain tells you one thing . Your instinct another . " " Sure , " Chee said . " I guess so . " " And which one is right ? " In the map on the wall behind his desk he put a pin at Tano Pueblo , and another between Crownpoint and Thoreau , about where Kanitewa had stayed with his father . Chee noticed they had pink heads , the same color as the pins already stuck in the map at Thoreau , and at the place in Coyote Canyon where Ahkeah 's family lived . Leaphorn dropped the sur-  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever wonder why I fool with those pins ? " " Yeah , " Chee said . He 'd heard of Leaphorn 's pin-littered map ever since he 'd joined the force . Captain Largo , his boss when he worked the Tuba City district , told him Leaphorn used them to work out mathematical solutions to crimes that puzzled him . Largo could n't explain how that worked . Neither could Chee . " I do n't know myself , exactly , " Leaphorn said . " I got into the habit years ago . It seems like sometimes it helps me think . It puts things in perspective . " He tapped the pin at Tano with a finger . " For example , we seem to have a connection now between two crimes . Or do we ? About seventy miles apart on the map . Does the Kanitewa boy connect them ? It sure as hell looks like it now . " " It does to me . I 'd bet a year 's pay on it , " Chee said . Leaphorn made a tent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? " he asked . " Why are you so certain ? " " Because ? " The telephone on Leaphorn 's desk interrupted him . Leaphorn picked it up , said , " Call me back in ten min-utes , " and hung up . He looked at Chee , motioned for him to continue . " Because of the package , mostly , " Chee said . " Because of the chronology . " Leaphorn nodded . " Yes . I think so too . But what was in that package ? " He was asking both of them the question . He looked at Chee . " Any ideas ? " " None , " Chee said . " Except Kanitewa must have thought it was in some way connected with his religion . That 's what he told Blizzard . And he took it to his uncle .  | To the koshare . We know that . And we think we know that he picked it up in Eric Dorsey 's shop . " Leaphorn swiveled in his chair , looked at the map a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report reads , Kanitewa 's dad was driving in to Gallup . The boy had his dad drop him off at Thoreau because Bluehorse had been making a silver bracelet in Dorsey 's class . Bluehorse wanted to give it to his girlfriend that night and he 'd asked Kanitewa to pick it up for him . We do n't know when his dad dropped him off . Probably midmorning and probably it does n't matter . The next thing we have an approximate time on is when Kanitewa called Bluehorse and asked him to come and get him . That was late in the noon hour because Bluehorse remembers he 'd just finished eating lunch . Am I getting this right ? " " So far , " Chee said . " Kanitewa told Bluehorse he was calling from the pay phone out in front of the mission . He said he had Bluehorse 's bracelet , he could n't wait for his dad to come back from Gallup , and could Bluehorse come and get him . Pick him up , but not at the mission but at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kanitewa was very excited . It was very important . Do n't let me down , friend . That sort of thing . So Bluehorse borrowed his mother 's pickup truck and drove over to Thoreau and pulled up at the video place . But Kanitewa was n't just sitting there waiting for him . So Bluehorse went inside to look for him , and when he came out , Kanitewa was sitting in the cab of his pickup . " Leaphorn paused , studying Chee .  | " You remember what I was saying the other day about putting in the details ? Your report reads : When Bluehorse came out Kanitewa was sitting in his pickup . ' But was he crouched down out of sight , or sitting up ? That 's an example . If we knew that it would tell us something about how scared the boy was at that point . " Chee allowed himself to make a minuscule nod . He was not in the mood for a lesson in report writing . " Kanitewa gives Bluehorse the bracelet , " Leaphorn continued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen Dorsey . He must have given Dorsey the note from Bluehorse  --  the receipt for the bracelet . Otherwise Dorsey would n't have turned it loose . Right ? " " I 'd think so . As far as we know , Dorsey had never met Kanitewa . " " Now you need to know some things , " Leaphorn said . " That bracelet was probably in a cabinet in a little storeroom between the shop and Dorsey 's office . That 's where Dorsey kept his supply of silver ingots , and turquoise , and the more valuable stuff the kids were working on . To get it for Kanitewa he 'd have to leave the shop , or his office if the boy had found him in his office . " Leaphorn paused , checked Chee 's expression to determine if he understood the implication of this . Chee understood . It meant Kanitewa would have had an opportunity to steal something . Perhaps something to be taken away , wrapped in a newspaper , and delivered to his uncle , the koshare . " The cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chee asked . " Is that right ? " " Unlocked , " Leaphorn said , looking thoughtful . " And  | a lot of stuff that had been in it was missing . The silver and the other stuff found in the box under Ahkeah 's place , all of that came out of the cabinet . " " All of it ? " Chee asked . " That 's a good question , " Leaphorn said . " I think Toddy was jumping to that conclusion . But I do n't know for sure . " " It probably does n't matter , " Chee said . " No . But how do we know whether it does or not ? " They thought about that for a moment . For the first time , Chee found himself feeling comfortable with the lieutenant . Leaphorn had swiveled again and seemed to be looking at the map . Now he made a dismissive gesture , and turned back . " Bluehorse told Kanitewa he did n't have enough gas to take him all the way to Tano , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interstate 40 and he could get a ride there , " Leaphorn said . " That correct ? And Bluehorse did n't see the package until Kanitewa got out ? " " Right . " " But it was already wrapped in the newspaper ? Whatever it was ? " Chee nodded . " And Bluehorse asked what it was and Kanitewa said he could n't tell him . It was religious . " " Something from Dorsey 's office ? " Leaphorn said . " Probably . " They thought about that . The telephone rang . Leaphorn lifted one end of the receiver with a finger to break the connection . " You see any other possibility ? You think maybe he brought it with him when he came from his home ? "  | " He could have , " Chee said . " But I think somehow that whatever it was , it was the object that caused all the excitement . The big excited call to Bluehorse . That ca n't wait for dad ' business . All the game playing . " Leaphorn considered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiver , broke the connection with his forefinger , laid the receiver on the desk . " Yes , " he said . " I think you 're right . And how about chronology now . Was Dorsey alive and well when Kanitewa left him ? " " I 'd say yes . " " Yeah , " Leaphorn said , nodding . " But when Kanitewa was leaving , he saw somebody coming in . I 'm guessing now , but am I right ? Maybe Ahkeah . Maybe somebody else . " " I think you 're right . And they saw him . And he knew it , " Chee said . Leaphorn considered that , nodded . " So when the boy heard the radio broadcast , when he heard Dorsey had been killed , then everything clicked . He rushed off to warn his uncle about it . " " Maybe , " Chee said . " At least I ca n't think of anything better . " " So what did the koshare do then ? As far as we know , he ignored the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kachina dance , the koshare performance . " He did his duty , " Chee said . " From what little I heard at Tano , and mostly from what Blizzard picked up and passed along , I think he was that kind of a man . Blizzard said everybody he interviewed liked him . He said it was more than just do n't speak bad  | of the dead , ' more than just the usual everybody being nice you get when somebody gets killed . Blizzard said they really respected him . Admired him . He must have been a good man . " " The kind they 'd call a valuable man , " ' Leaphorn said . He stood up , put the telephone receiver back on the hook , looked at the map again . " You know , " he said . " Maybe we 've got another connection here . This Dorsey was also a valuable man . " He smiled at Chee . " How do you like the idea of a serial killer who hates valuable men ? " " Bluehorse told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or supposed to be gay . He said he drove the water truck . The one the mission runs to refill water barrels for old people who ca n't get around . He took them meals . All that . " " That 's right . You better read the file on it , " Leaphorn said . He dug it out of the basket on his desk , handed it to Chee . " See if what you know about the Sayesva case connects with anything at Thoreau . " " Okay . " " And one more thing . I still want you to find Delmar Kanitewa. "  | THE TROUBLE WAS Chee could n't find the Kanitewa boy . Neither could Harold Blizzard . Now both the Albuquerque and Gallup offices of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , each with its own separate and individual federal-reservation homicide case , decided it was important to have a chat with Delmar . Gallup was wondering how on God 's green earth Chee had let him slip away and Albuquerque was asking the same question of Sergeant Blizzard . Blizzard resented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , You just walked into the school and made the telephone call and left him sitting there ? " '  | Blizzard had raised his voice two notches to represent the voice of the agent-in-charge at Albuquerque . " And I say , That 's because there 's no telephone in the patrol car . ' And he says , You did n't think about taking him into the school with you ? ' and I say , If I had known he was going to slip away we would n't be having this stupid con-versation. ? Chee laughed . " Did you really say that ? " They had met at the Gallup police station and decided to leave Blizzard 's car there and take Chee 's pickup to begin another phase of what Blizzard called The Great Delmar Hunt . Now they were jolting down Navajo Road 7028 about fifteen miles west of the Torreon Trading Post , looking for a dirt road which would , if they could only find it , lead them across the south fork of Chico Arroyo and thence to the place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paternal clan relative of Delmar 's . Blizzard was driving , giving Chee a rest . It was early afternoon , and both were tired of driving down bumpy dirt roads , tired of searching for people who were n't at home , of asking questions of people who did n't know the answer  --  and maybe would n't have told them if they did know . Besides , Chee 's back hurt . His lower back , about where the hips connect . " Well , " Blizzard said . He had been silent so long that Chee had forgotten what they were talking about . " Maybe not exactly those words , but he got the idea . " He gestured out the windshield . " Look at that , " he said . " Those colors . In the clouds and in the sky and in the grass . I think I could get used to this . Nothing much to do out here in the boonies , but lots to look at . "  | Chee shifted his thoughts from back pain to landscape . Indeed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , low in the southwest , and shadows slanted away from every juniper . They formed zebra stripes where the slopes ran north and a polka-dot pattern where they slanted . The grass was never really green in this land of little rain . Now it was a golden autumn tan with streaks of silver and white where the sickle-shaped seeds of grama were waving , tinted blue here and there by distance and shadow . Miles away , beyond the hills , the vertical slopes of Chivato Mesa formed a wall . Above the mesa stood the serene blue shape of Tsodzil , the Turquoise Mountain which First Man had built as one of the four sacred corner posts of Navajo Country . And over all that , the great , arching , multilayered sky  --  the thin , translucent fan of ice crystals still glittering in the full sun . Thousands of feet lower , a scattering of puffy gray-white cumulus clouds  --  outriders of the storm the weatherman had been predicting  --  marched eastward ahead of the wind . " It 's beautiful . I 'll give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some way to pull it together a lot better . Everything is too damn far apart . " " You get used to that , too , " Chee said . " Somebody once wrote a book about it . They called it The Land of Room Enough , and Time . " " We 're sure wasting enough of that today , " Blizzard said . " You keeping track of the mileage ? " " The man said it was 16.3 miles from the gas pump at the trading post , " Chee said . " That ought to be it there . "  | Up ahead , tracks led from the gravel into the roadside borrow ditch , climbed out of it , crossed a cattle guard between two fence posts , and wandered erratically through the grass toward the horizon , disappearing on downslopes and reappearing on ridges . " Not exactly the Pennsylvania Turnpike , " Blizzard said . " And when we get down it , Gray Lady what's-hername wo n't be home . " " She 's home , " Chee said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benally . " " She wo n't be home . I 'll bet you , " Blizzard said . He reached for his billfold . " You lose , " Chee said . He pointed . " See the old boot stuck on the fence post ? The toe 's pointed in . If it 's pointed out , they 're gone to town and you save yourself the drive . Blizzard stared at him , impressed . " My God , " he said . " That 's pretty damn clever . Wonder if us Cheyennes figured out anything like that . " " You 've really never been to your reservation ? Never lived out there with your people at all ? " " Just once , " Blizzard said . " When my dad 's mother died , we went out for the funeral . I think we just stayed a couple of days . I remember the night . I was little and about all I could think of was how cold it was in my uncle 's shack . And I remember the other kids did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , " Chee said . " They were country kids . Bashful . They figured you 'd be stuck-up . " He grinned , trying to imagine this hardassed cop as a boy . " I bet you were , too . "  | The dirt track to the Benally place proved to be smoother than the washboard gravel of Route 7028 . It led a mile and a half to an expanse of packed dirt on which stood a log hogan with a dirt roof and one of those small frame houses which , before the era of aluminum mobile homes , were hauled around on flatbed oil-company trucks to shelter crews of drilling rigs . It had been painted white once but not much paint had survived the winters . Two standard fifty-five-gallon oil drums stood on a platform beside the door . An empty corral was behind it , with too many poles missing to make it useful , and behind the corral , a brush arbor sagged . A woman with a shawl over her head leaned in the open doorway , watching while Chee parked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little older , with a onceround face now shrunken by the years . " I hope you are well , Grandmother , " he said in Navajo . He told her his mother 's clan , and his father 's , and that he was a tribal policeman . " And this man beside me is a Cheyenne Indian . His people were part of those who beat General Custer . And we have come to find out if you can help us with a problem . " Gray Old Lady recited her clans , including being born to the Bitter Water People of Delmar Kanitewa 's father . She invited them in , signaled them to seat themselves on a bench beside the table , and offered them coffee . While the pot heated on the wood stove against the wall , Chee made his pitch . It was the fifth time he 'd made it since morning and he hurried through it , making sure the old woman knew they did n't want to arrest the boy  --  only to talk to him .  | She poured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for a half-cup for Chee and Blizzard . None for her . She put it back on the shelf . " I know the boy , " she said . " My grandson 's son . We called him Sheep Chaser . But I have n't seen him this year . Not for a long time . " Chee sipped the coffee . It was strong and stale . Through the doorway into the other room he could see a form lying motionless under a blanket . " Does Sheep Chaser have any good friends around here ? Somebody he might be visiting ? " " I do n't think so , " she said . " He goes to live with his mother 's people . The Tano People . I do n't know anything about him anymore . " Which was exactly what Chee had expected to hear . He translated the gist of it to Blizzard . Blizzard nodded and grunted . " Tell her I said thank you very much for all the assistance , " Blizzard said . " We thank you , " Chee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone in your family ill ? " She turned and looked into the bedroom . " That is my husband , " she said . " He is so old that he does not know who he is anymore . He has even forgotten how to walk and how to say words . " " Is there anyone helping you ? " Chee said . " Taking care of things ? " " There is the bilagaana from the mission at Thoreau , " she said . " He comes in his truck and keeps our water barrel filled and twice a week he brings us food . But this week he has n't come . " Chee felt sick . " Is his name Eric Dorsey ? "  | Gray Old Lady produced an ancient-sounding chuckle . " We call him our begadoche . Our water sprinkler . Because he brings our water . And because he makes us laugh . " The memory of laughter produced a small , toothless smile . " He has this thing , like a duck , and he pretends to make it talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands up to her chest , looking worried . " Except this week , he did n't come . " " How much water do you have ? " Chee asked . " One barrel is empty , " she said . " The other one , maybe about this much . " She demonstrated six inches of water with her hands . " When he comes he always looks into the barrels , and last week he said he would fill them when he came this time . But he did n't come . " Blizzard had said polite words to the old woman in English and was walking back to the car . She kept her eyes on Chee , looking worried . " Do you think he will come next week ? " she said . " If he does n't come next week I will have to use less water . " " I will send someone out here to fill your water barrels , Grandmother , " Chee said . " I will send somebody from the mission at Thoreau or somebody from the tribal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell them that you need help . " " But the bilagaana has helped us , " she said , looking puzzled . " In many ways . " She pointed at the rocking chair . It was beautifully made , with simple lines , and looked new . " He made that for us , at the school I think . I le said that chair would be better for my back when I sit beside the bed . And with the duck he would make my husband laugh . "  | " Grandmother , " Chee said . " I think the bilagaana who helped you is dead . " She seemed not to hear him . " He brings us food and he fills our water barrels and he took my man in to see the bilagaana doctors . And he helped us when my daughter had rugs to sell . He told us the man at the trading post was not paying enough . And he sold them for us and got a lot more money . " " Grandmother , " Chee said . " Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen . " The trader had been giving us fifty dollars but Begadoche got three hundred dollars once , and once it was more than six hundred . And when I had to sell my necklace and my bracelets because we did n't have any money he told me the pawn place in Gallup did n't give us enough , and he knew someone who would pay a lot more because they were old and he got them out of pawn and the man he knew gave us a lot more money . " Chee held up his hand . " Grandmother . Listen . The bilagaana wo n't come anymore because he is dead . I will have to send someone else . Do you understand ? " Gray Old Lady Benally understood . She must have understood all along because even while she was talking her cheeks were wet with tears .  | LOOKING BACK on it , trying to analyze how it came to be , Chee finally decided it was partly bad luck and mostly his own fault . They had left Blizzard 's car at Gallup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the direction of Chee 's place to get it . Bad luck , again . It happened that way because the very last people they 'd wasted their time checking lived over by the Standing Rock Chapter House . So they drifted homeward past Coyote Canyon on Navajo Route 9 . That took them right past the Yah-Tah-Hay intersection , which put them almost as close to Chee 's trailer in Window Rock as to Blizzard 's car in Gallup . And somewhere before then  | Blizzard had said he was just too damned tired of driving to drive home . That brought them to the part that was Chee 's own fault . " Why do n't you get a motel room in Gallup ? " Chee said . " Then you can just call your office tomorrow . Find out if they 're ready to let us give up on this one . " " I 'll just sleep in my car , " Blizzard had said . It was at that point Chee had screwed himself up once again . Maybe it was being tired himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Window Rock ? or maybe it was feeling sort of guilty for thinking Blizzard was such a hardass when actually he was just new and green . Or maybe it was sympathy for Blizzard  --  a lonesome stranger in a strange land  --  or maybe he was feeling a little lonely himself . Whatever the motive , Chee had said , " Why do n't you just bed down at my place ? It 's better than the backseat of a car . " And Blizzard , of course , said , " Good idea . " And so there they were , Blizzard deciding he 'd sleep on the couch and saying he 'd volunteer to cook supper unless Chee wanted to go back into Window Rock and eat someplace there . Then the telephone rang . " It 's Janet , " the caller said . " I got the impression the other day at the Navajo Inn that you wanted to talk to me about something . Was I right ? " " Absolutely , " Chee said . " So I have an idea . Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as extras , and they were supposed to be Cheyennes but they were talking Navajo , and saying all the wrong things ? The one that they always bring back to that drive-in movie at Gallup ?  | Sort of a campy deal , like The Rocky Horror Picture Show ? " " Yeah , " Chee said . " Cheyenne Autumn . A couple of my relatives are extras in it . " " Well , it 's back again and I thought ? " But Blizzard was eavesdropping . He overheard . He entered the conversation . " Cheyenne Autumn , " he said . " Yeh ! " " Who was that ? " Janet said . " You have company ? " " A BIA policeman . Harold Blizzard . " " You told me about him , " Janet said . " He 's a Cheyenne himself , is n't he ? I bet he 'd like to see that movie . Why do n't you ask him to come along ? " " I 'm sure he 's already seen it . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a voice Chee felt was inappropriately loud . " I 've heard about it , but I never have seen it . " " He has n't seen it , " Janet said . " I heard him . Why do n't you bring him along ? Do n't you think it would be fun to get a Cheyenne 's reaction ? " Chee did n't think so . Janet did n't know this Cheyenne . He glanced at Blizzard , sitting on the edge of his couch , looking expectant . " You wan na go ? " " Sure , " Blizzard said . " I 'd love to go . If I wo n't be in the way . " " We can talk after the movie , " Janet said . Of course . But they could have also talked during the movie . And talking about the movie during the movie  --  celebrating the small victory of The People over the white man that this John Ford classic represented ? was the reason Navajos still came to see it , and the rea-  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . And besides talking during the movie , if things developed as Chee had hoped , there were things to do besides talk . So here they were in Janet Pete 's Ford Escort , parked fifth row from the screen with pickup trucks on both sides of them , with Janet sitting beside him and Sergeant Harold Blizzard hulking over them in the backseat . But one might as well make the best of whatever fate was offering . " Right in here , " Chee said . " Just a minute now . She 'll be the first girl you see doing the drumming . There she is . That 's Irma . My oldest sister . " The scene was solemn . Three Navajos playing the roles of three Cheyenne shamans were about to pray to God that the U.S. government would keep its treaty promises  --  a naive concept , which had drawn derisive hoots and horn honkings from the rows of pickup trucks and cars . A row of Cheyenne maidens were tapping methodically at drums , accompanying the chanted prayers . " How about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navajo , too ? " Blizzard was leaning forward , chin on the seat back , his big ugly face between Janet and Chee . " Sort of , " Chee said . " It 's a kind of modification of a song they sing at Girl Dances , but they slowed it down to make it sound solemn . " This was not the way Chee had intended this date with Janet Pete to turn out . Richard Widmark , commanding the cavalry detachment in charge of keeping order at this powwow between  | government bureaucrats and the Cheyenne , was now establishing himself as pro-Indian by making derogatory remarks about the reservation where the government was penning the tribe . Since the landscape at which Widmark was pointing was actually the long line of salmoncolored cliffs behind the lyanbito Chapter House just south of Gallup , this produced more horn honking and a derisive shout from somewhere . And so it went . Scenes came in which somber-looking Cheyenne leaders responded to serious questions in somber-sounding Navajo . When converted back into English by the translator the answers made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience , and prompted the " What did he really say ? " question from either Janet or Blizzard  --  and often both . What he really said tended to have something to do with the size of the colonel 's penis , or some other earthy and humorous irrelevancy . Chee would sanitize this a bit or put the humor in the context of Navajo customs or taboos , or explain that the celebratory honking was merely noting the screen appearance of somebody 's kin-folks . It was a long movie , but not long enough for Chee to come up with a plan that would have disposed of Blizzard . The most obvious solution was to simply drive by the Navajo Nation Inn , drop him off , and tell him you 'd pick him up in the morning . But that was blown by the fact that Blizzard had left his briefcase at Chee 's place and the briefcase contained ( as Blizzard had proudly told him ) " everything you have to have if you get caught somewhere overnight . " Coming up with something better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar at the projection center to buy another bucket of popcorn and driving off without him , was ruled out by Janet 's unexpected behavior . She seemed to have developed a liking for the man , laughing at his jokes , engaging him in discussions of their mutual childhoods as city Indians , quizzing him about what he knew about his tribe , and so forth . And so , movie finally over , Janet drove them home . And there , with the car still rolling to a stop , Harold Blizzard did something to reestablish himself in Jim Chee 's esteem . " Janet , " Blizzard said , " this has been a lot of fun , and I hope to see you again , but now I 'm going to rush right in and get some sleep . " And he had the door open and was out even before he finished the sentence . Janet turned off the engine . And the lights . Without a word they watched Blizzard disappear into Chee 's trailer . " I like him , " Janet said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , " he said . " And he was right . It was fun . " " It was , " Janet said . " And it was sweet of you to bring him along . " " It was , was n't it , " Chee said . " But why do you think so ? " " Because you wanted to talk to me . " " Yep , " Chee said . " About what ? " " Us . " " Us ? " Light from the autumn moon lit her face . She was smiling at him .  | " We 've been friends a long time , " Chee said . " Two years , I guess . More than that . Ever since you were trying to nail that old man I was representing up at Farmington . Almost three years if you add in that time I was away at Washington . " " I was n't trying to nail him , " Chee said . " I was looking for information . " " And you tried to trick me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Remember ? I found out what I needed to know . " " I remember , " she said . " But now I think I 'm ready to forgive you . " And with that , Janet Pete leaned across , put her hand behind Chee 's head , pulled his face down , and kissed him , and sighed , and kissed him again . It was quite a while later , although the moon was still illuminating Janet 's face , when she said , " No , Jim . No . Time to stop . " " What ? " he said . " Why ? " " Because , " she said . " I think we sort of stopped being just friends . So now we have to get better acquainted . " " That 's just what we were doing , " Chee said . " No , " Janet said , sitting up straight , buttoning buttons . " I tried that way once . It does n't work . It hurts too much if you 're wrong . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law school . " " Not this time , " Chee said . " This time you 're not wrong . It 's me . And you 're right . " . Janet looked at him , and then out the windshield , thinking . " When you 're a certain age , " she said , " when  | you 're young , and you fall in love  --  or think you have ? then you think that sex is the way you prove it . Prove that you 're in love . " She was still staring out the windshield , straight ahead . " But it does n't prove a damned thing . " Chee thought about that . " What you 're saying " What I 'm saying is I know I like you . Maybe I like you a lot . Even an awful lot . But it does n't have anything at all to do with ? " She paused . Looked at him . Grinning , at him now . " To be exactly correct , it does n't have much to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lanky frame , and all those muscles . I started liking you because you 're kind to people . " " If I had known that , I would have been even kinder , " Chee said . " But I 'm not going to be just another of Jim Chee 's girlfriends . " " Hey , " Chee said . " What do you mean by that ? " " I mean we hear about things . We women . " " No truth to it , " Chee said . " I 'm too busy . " Janet laughed . " Exactly what I hear , " she said . " Very busy . A girl at every chapter house . " " Come on , Janet , " Chee said . " Knock it off . " " Remember , " she said . " You told me about the schoolteacher at Crownpoint . The one you were in love with . " " A long time ago , " Chee said . Janet was silent for a moment . " How about her ? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christmas card , " Chee said . " Wrote Happy Holidays ' on it . "  | Janet smiled at him , her face illuminated by the moon . " That sounds safe enough , " she said . " Now it 's your turn . How about The Attorney at Law ? " It took her a while to answer . And while he waited , Chee felt his stomach tighten . What would she say ? How would she say it ? She said , in a small voice , " I do n't like to think about him . " And Chee , who really wanted to drop it , knew that he could n't . He said , " Tell me why not . " " Because it makes me feel so totally stupid . Naive . Dumb . " She slammed her fist against the dashboard . " What the hell was I thinking of ? I get so angry I want to cry . " " You do n't love him anymore ? " " I do n't think I ever did . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophisticated . And glamorous . He made me feel important , or something , to have an important lawyer interested in me . But , actually , I do n't even like him . " He put his arm around her , pulled her against him , and talked into her hair . " I can understand that , " he said . " I 'll tell you why . Because way back when you and I got acquainted , fairly early on , I got to thinking sort of like that . I 'd think , I 'm a kid out of a sheep camp . Janet 's beautiful . She 's a sophisticated city girl . A lawyer . All that . Yet I think she likes me . ' It made me feel great . Made me feel about nine feet tall . " Janet snuggled against him . " Ummmmm , " she said . You know how to make me feel good . My mother 's a Scot , but if she was Irish , she 'd say you were full of blarney . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know if the Navajos , if we Navajos , have a word for it . But we certainly should . Sort of like baloney . Or maybe bull . " " No , I 'm not , " Chee said . " But if real lawyers impress you , I should tell you I might get made into a real ser-geant . " " Well , I think it 's high time that happened . But were n't you already a sergeant once ? " " Acting sergeant , " Chee said . " But that only lasted a few months . " " I remember . It was when you worked at Crownpoint . Before you burned your hand so terribly . Trying to open the door on that burning car . " She snuggled against him again . " But tell me about getting promoted . " Chee found himself wishing he had n't brought it up . It was n't likely to happen . " I probably wo n't , " he said . " It 's really more like a joke . But the lieutenant told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guy in that Todachene hit-and-run thing I told you about . The one where the driver backed up and took a look at the pedestrian he 'd hit and then drove away and let the man bleed to death . " Chee produced a mirthless chuckle . " The lieutenant says that if I can find the guy , I 'll get promoted . " " Oh , " Janet said . " The catch being that there is n't a clue . Everything you can check out in a case like that has already been checked . The garages , paint shops , people who might have seen something . There 's nothing to go on . " " That 's not fair , " Janet said . " You should have been promoted a long time ago anyway . But so what ? "  | " But what you said about burning my hand reminds me , " Chee said . " I 'll tell you what made me really feel great about you . I 'll never forget it . " He waited . She snuggled again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead and tell . " " They let me out of the hospital at Albuquerque with that hand all wrapped up so I could n't use it , and when I got home I found you 'd gotten into my trailer and washed all the dishes , and swept , and got the windows all shiny , and cleaned out the refrigerator , and put in some fresh milk and eggs and things like that , and did the laundry , and ? " " Women lawyers like to play housekeeper now and then , " she said . " And you had the blues , too . Remember that ? You were really down . I did n't want you to come home to a dirty house . All alone , and everything 's a mess . I 've done that often enough to know it 's awfully depressing . " " Anyway , I loved you for it . And I still do . " And having said that , he put his hand under her chin , and treasured the silky feel of her skin , and raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And this went on for quite a while . And , having done that , he knew it was time  --  in fact it was way past time  --  to pose the question he had been dreading to ask . " You remember when I asked you about your dad ? About where he was from . What part of the reservation . And what his clans were . And you said he was just little when his parents were relocated to Chicago and he never talked about it , and you said you really did n't know . You remember that ? "  | Janet 's head moved against his face , her hair incredibly soft , smelling clean , smelling beautiful , looking beautiful in the moonlight . It was an affirmative nod . " And you said you 'd ask him next time you talked to him ? Get him to be more specific . " Another nod . Chee took a deep breath . He should have handled this a long time ago . But he was afraid to press it because it seemed presumptuous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was afraid of what the answer might be . Chee 's mother 's clan was the Slow Talking People , and his father was born to the Bitter Water Clan . If Janet Pete 's father belonged to either of those on either side of his family , then what he and Janet had been doing here was wrong . It violated one of the most stringent taboos of the Navajos  --  the rigid and complex rules by which The People prohibited incest . Probably Mr. Pete did n't belong to either of them . There wen , about sixty-five other clans he could belong to . But then there was Janet 's paternal grandmother 's paternal clan , and his own family 's linked clans . They , too , would make any sexual relationship between Janet and him taboo He had to find out . But Janet was n't saying anything . " Did he tell you ? " " He was n't sure , " Janet said . Chee wanted to think about that . He had never known a reservation-born Navajo who did n't know Ills clans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man or woman . But perhaps this man 's mother- living In a white man 's city a thousand miles from the sacred  | mountains  --  had wanted to make a white man out of her son . That sometimes happened . Or maybe Janet 's father simply did n't want to tell her . Or was kidding her for some reason . Chee could n't imagine why he 'd do that . " Did he have any idea ? Could he tell you anything helpful ? " " He was sure he did n't know about my grandfather 's clans , because Grandfather had died before they moved . When Dad was just a little boy . But he said he thought his mother might have belonged to the Hunger People . He said he remembered her joking about that . Saying it was appropriate for their family . " Chee probed through his memory . " Hunger People , " he said . " That 's the Dichin Dine'e . " Janet sensed his mood . " Why all the questions ? " she said . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out here long enough to know the answer to that one . " She pushed herself away from him . " Well , " she said . " How did I do ? Am I eli-gible ? " She laughed as she said it . " I 'm like your dad , " Chee said . " I 'm not sure . Maybe I 'm poison for you . " He tried to make it sound like a joke . They sat in the cold moonlight . Janet sighed . " You know what ? " she said . " I have a long day tomorrow . And you have to do whatever you policemen do on Tuesdays . So , if I can think of a way to get you out of the car , I 'll go on home and get some sleep . " This was not the way Chee wanted this evening to end . He was n't ready to step out into the cold night . " I want to ask you about something , " he said . " Did you notice when we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't feel like any more questions . " " This one 's about Blizzard , " he said . " Did you notice how different his reaction was to some of the scenes in that movie ? We Navajos would be laughing and honking our horns at our private joke , and he would be looking sad . Same scene , exactly . He 'd be watching the destruction of his culture . We 'd be watching our kinfolks making fun of the white folks in the movie . " " Different for me , too , " Janet said . " My Navajo was n't good enough to get the joke most of the time . " She frowned at him . " How do you know how Blizzard was taking it ? You were watching him in the rearview mirror , were n't you ? " " Yeah , " Chee said . " And me too , I bet . " " Mostly you , " Chee admitted . " Sneaky , " Janet said . " Why watch us ? " He wanted to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to look at you . Because I have stupidly , hopelessly , allowed myself to fall in love with you . But he did n't say it . There was the problem of t ho Dichin Dine'e . Was his memory correct ? Was there soma linkage of that little clan and one of his own ? A long limo ago , on a winter night when such teaching is appropriate , Hosteen Frank Sam Nakai , his Little Father , had given him the history of his Slow Talking People  --  tracing it all the way back to the mythic times just after Changing Woman had left The People to rejoin her lover , the Sun . He had been a boy then , and some of the clan to nections had seemed vague and unimportant . But now  | the name of the Hunger People stirred something in his memory . And now it had become terribly important . It determined whether Jim Chee and Janet Pete were permissible as friends but taboo as lovers . So instead of saying what he wanted to say , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cowboy sitting on t he roof at Tano  --  watching the kachina dance . Cowboy 's I lopi , and he 's in one of the Hopi kachina societies himself , so he saw a lot that we missed . But not as much as the Tano people . All of us up there on the roof were outsiders , I mean . Like the Cheyenne watching the Navajos retending to be Cheyennes . He missed a lot . We missed lot , too . I wonder what . " " Me , too , " Janet said , voice glum . " I mean , me and lizzard , too . There was a lot I did n't understand at the ovie . Not understanding Navajo very well . And to tell e truth , not understanding about being a Navajo . " Chee studied her profile . He realized , abruptly and with shock , that she was trying not to cry . He expericed a sudden jarring enlightenment . He was seeing a fillet Pete he had never even dreamed existed . He was ' Ong a lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy mounded by the town kids in boarding school ; he , who el been the country bumpkin among the sophisticates the University of New Mexico ; he , of all people , should ha , ve recognized what Janet would have encountered on is **34;0;TOOLONG . But he had n't . He I seen only the shrewd attorney who looked great in pensive clothing , who wore the armor of wit , humor , education , intelligence . He had n't seen the girl who was trying to find a home . lie felt an almost overpowering  | urge to pull Janet Pete to him , wrap his arms around her , comfort her , warm her against this cold moonlight , tell her he understood , tell her that he loved her and would care for her forever , and would die to make her happy . Almost overpowering . He could have done it a week ago when they were friends . Now there was the question of the Hunger People . They had moved into that territory beyond friendship and Chee did n't know the way back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Chee could n't think of it . So he simply looked at her profile , as she sat , forlorn , shoulders slumped , staring out the windshield . And he said : " Remember at Tano ? The koshare had come tumbling down off their roof and a couple of them had grabbed one of the kachinas . They were doing a lot of loud talking , gesturing , that sort of thing . And the crowd was laughing . Good-natured . Everybody was having fun . Getting into what was going on . And then the clown camo in dressed up like a cowboy , riding the stick horse . And the clown with the little toy wagon , selling their stuff to the guy dressed up like he was supposed to be a tourist , or a trader . And remember , sort of suddenly the laughing stopped there for a moment . Everything got quiet . " " Okay , " Janet said . " Okay . I remember . " " I wonder what we missed , " Chee said . " I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what that meant , " Janet said . " I have no idea . But I guess this conversation we 're having right now means we have reverted back to our traditional status . "  | " Traditional status ? " " Back to being old friends , " Janet said . " Good buddies . Remember ? Back to telling each other our troubles . Giving each other all sorts of bad advice . About our love affairs with other people . " " I would n't say that , " Chee said . He could n't think of anything more sensible to say . " But do n't you have any ideas about what might have been going on there at Tano ? Any ? " Janet leaned across him and opened his door . " Out , " she said . " Go to bed . Be a cop tomorrow . " In the trailer , Chee dropped on his bunk still in his jacket and boots and managed not to think of Janet Pete . Ile thought of the Todachene case . The case without leads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ byway used mostly by reservation locals . That meant the driver was probably a Navajo . No matter how drunk he 'd been , he must be aware by now of the nature of his crime . He would feel the guilt . It would force him out of hozho , out of that state of harmony which is the goal of Navajo metaphysics . If he was traditional , he would be calling on a shaman for help . Tomorrow , Chee ought , he would begin putting out the word to the edicine people in the Checkerboard and on the northeast side of the Big Rez . If he was patient , maybe some formation would come drifting back . A ceremonial re for a man who had been involved with death . The an was probably a drunk , someone who had left the Navajo Way . But it was worth a try . The second thing he would do tomorrow would be to ) vide the lieutenant with a memo about the Sayesva  | homicide . Leaphorn had made it clear he did n't want Chee intruding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigid as he was , Leaphorn was also smart . He 'd earned his reputation . The memo would inform the lieutenant that something odd seemed to have transpired at the Tano ceremonial , something involving the performance of the clowns . Leaphorn could take it from there . And with that thought , Chee sat up , undressed , and got under his blanket . He listened to the night sounds , which on this night included the heavy breathing of a sleeping Cheyenne . And he thought about the choice he might have to make between Janet Pete and the religion that had always given his life its purpose .  | THE NEXT DAY was a day off for Officer Jim Chee . He drove Blizzard to Gallup to pick up his car at the police station . He went to the office on the chance he might catch Leaphorn and did n't . He typed up the intended memo and put it in the in-basket on the lieutenant 's tidy desk . He spent a moment examining the oversized map that decorated the wall behind Leaphorn 's desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still connected the Tano Pueblo homicide with the one at Thoreau . He nodded to Virginia on the way out and spent the rest of the morning at Gallup Quality Electronics getting the Citizens Band radio in his pickup truck back in  | working order . That done , he drove north on U.S. 666 , along the east flank of the Chuska Mountains , past Tohatchi , and the Naschitti Boarding School , and the Sheep Springs Chapter House , to the Newcomb turnoff ? and then climbed westward , past the little cluster of buildings that was Two Grey Hills , past the old Toadlena boarding school , and onto the old rutted road that led to the sheep camp of Hosteen Frank Sam Nakai , the elder brother of his mother . He had been thinking , as he left Gallup , of anything except Janet Pete . Time enough for that later . After he had talked to Hosteen Nakai . After he knew what to think . Now he thought about his vehicular homicide case . Apparently hopeless . Nothing to go on . Nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approve of luck . He thought about why Leaphorn , in the face of fairly solid evidence , did n't seem to believe that Eugene Ahkeah had killed Eric Dorsey , or anyone else . He thought about where he might look next for Delmar , his sneaky little problem . And about why the crowd had fallen silent when the clown 's wagon appeared in the Tano plaza . If Leaphorn was interested how that crime connected with the Dorsey case , he would ask the right people at Tano and find out about that . Then , as his truck jolted higher into the summer pastures of the Chuskas , and ponderosa pine replaced juniper and pinon , and the air was colder in his nostrils and brought the old high-country smells back to him , he thought of Hosteen Nakai , the Little Father of his boyhood . Nobody was home at the summer shack of Hosteen Nakai . Chee found Nakai 's mixed flock of sheep and  | goats in a meadow a mile away , and his uncle sitting on a rotted log with his horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the log beside him , apparently tuned to KNDN . From it came the impassioned voice of D. J. Nez singing , " My heroes have always been Indians . " " Dichin Dine'e , " said Hosteen Nakai . " That would have been way back , a long time ago when we got mixed up with them . Let me think about that a little bit . " While he thought he extracted a package of cigarette papers and a sack of Bull Durham from the pocket of his shirt , offered both to Chee , and made himself a cigarette . " It would have been back when the army made us prisoners and herded us off to Bosque Redondo . Back when we made the Long Walk . Everybody got mixed together then and there was some marrying back and forth . Even some marrying with the Apaches . They had a bunch of Mescalero Apaches penned up there with us . " He lit the cigarette . Exhaled . " Why you interested in the Hunger People ? It sounds to me like you finally found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I do n't know . Her father 's mother was born to the Dichin Dine'e , you think . But what 's her father 's clan ? What 's the rest of the family connections ? " " She does n't have a born to ' clan , " Chee said . " Her mother is a white woman . Her dad 's a Navajo . But they 're one of those relocation families . The government moved his family off the reservation in the 1940s . He was just a kid when it happened and I guess his family raised him white . He thinks his mother was Dichin Dine'e . Says he does n't know about his father 's clan . "  | Hosteen Nakai considered this , exhaled a cloud of blue smoke , muttered some imprecation under his breath . " Tell me about this woman , " he said . " And tell me about yourself . Tell me about the work you are doing . " Chee told Hosteen Nakai about Janet Pete , the city Navajo . And he told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside Navajo Route 1 and left the man to die beside the highway . Could Hosteen Nakai spread the word about this man among the small fraternity of medicine people ? Nakai said he would . Chee told him about the deaths of the Christian at Thoreau and the koshare at Tano , and how nobody seemed to know why either one had died , and about his frustrating hunt for Delmar Kanitewa . Nakai asked questions , about the Christian , about the koshare , about the grandmother of Delmar , about the package Delmar had carried . Five goats had separated themselves from the flock and drifted downslope . Nakai whistled to his dogs , resting in the tall grass beside the aspens . He pointed . The dogs raced down the slope , circled , brought the reluctant goats back to the fold . The autumn sun was low enough now to begin giving shape to rolling plains far below them . Chee could make out the dark line of shadows cast by Chaco Mesa forty miles to the west . North of that , the yellow-tan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and color  --  the slate erosion of the Bisti Badlands and the De-Na-Zin Wilderness . Beautiful . Peaceful . But Chee was nervous . Pretty soon Hosteen Nakai would be finished thinking and be ready  | to talk . For the first time Chee noticed that his uncle had become an old man . Now , what would he say ? " The man who hit the old man , and left him to die , " Nakai said . " I will ask the right people . You are right , if he is following the Beauty Way of the Navajos he would want to be cured of that . But why do you want to find him ? What good does it do for the man he killed ? What good does it do him ? I think you would put him in jail . That wo n't help him . " Nakai shrugged , dismissing it . He allowed the silence to take over , giving Chee time to frame his response . Chee simply nodded . " The Christian and the koshare . Two good men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Usually the people who get killed like this have worked at it themselves . " He puffed on the cigarette , exhaled . " You know what I mean . They fooled with somebody 's wife . They got drunk and hit somebody . They butchered some-body 's cow . Did something wrong , usually . They got out of harmony with everything so somebody might kill them . But not this time , you tell me . Two good men who helped people , hurt nobody . And they were a lot alike in other ways . The koshare , you know about them . I used to know a Hopi man who was a koshare at Moenkopi . He would say to me : Compared to what our Creator wanted us to be , all men are clowns . And that 's what we koshare do . We act funny to remind the people . To make the people laugh at themselves . We are the sacred clowns , ' he said . He is dead now , a long time , but I remember that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thoreau was funny , too . A good man and he made the children laugh . " Hosteen Nakai tapped the ash from his cigarette  | and looked at Chee , thoughtfully . As if wondering whether Chee could extract any meaning from this . Chee gave no sign that he had . " Two good men who made fun and helped people . Valuable men . But somebody killed them . There has to be a reason . Everything is connected . So you have to look for something outside of them . Something evil that somehow both of them touched . If you find the driver who killed the man , you do nothing for anybody . But if you find out why it was that these valuable men were killed , you do good work then . " Nakai pushed himself up from the log , stretched , looked down at Chee . " But you want to hear about the woman . That 's why you came here . The incest taboo . You know about it . How it makes you sick , makes you crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of harmony . So be careful about that woman for a while . " He took another drag on the cigarette . " I know an old man who lives over near Crystal . That 's where the Hunger People used to be a long time ago before the army moved them to Bosque Redondo . He 's a hataalii . He sings the Mountain Top Way , and the Red Ant Way , and some of the other cures . I will talk to him about this woman . I think he will know something about the Hunger People and our Slow Talking Clan . When I know , then I will tell you . " " How long will ? " " Young men are impatient when they see the woman they want , " Nakai said . " I know that . I will start tonight . " " Thank you , " Chee said . 140  | " One more thing . This boy you are looking for . You think he is running away because he is afraid . Does his grandmother still call the lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chee said . Why had n't he thought of that ? " No . Not for several days . " " Then the grandmother knows where to find him , " Nakai said . He exhaled smoke and stood looking into the blue cloud hanging in the still air . " And she also knows , I think , that the boy has some reason to be afraid . "  | THE VERY FIRST thing Jim Chee intended to do when he reached his office the next morning was call Tribal Councilwoman Bertha Roanhorse . The memos Virginia had left on his blotter asked him to return calls from Lieutenant Toddy at Crownpoint and Captain Largo at Tuba City . They could wait . So could the manila envelope Virginia had dropped in his in-basket . As it turned out , so could Jim Chee . The Navajo Communications Company telephone book listed a Roanhorse number among the nineteen telephones served by the Toadlena exchange , but a stern feminine voice on an answering machine instructed Chee to leave a message . He did . Then he  | called the Legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tribal Council committees on which Mrs. Roanhorse served was meeting today . He left another message . Next , he called the Navajo Nation Inn . Yes , Councilwoman Roanhorse was registered . She did n't answer the room phone . Chee left a third message . Having exhausted all possibilities he could think of , he returned the call to Captain Largo . Largo was out , but the Tuba City dispatcher had a message for him : " Tell Chee we have drawn a blank on front end repairs here in his hit-run case . " He called for Lieutenant Toddy at Crownpoint . The lieutenant was in . " I just wanted you to know we did n't forget you guys in the Navajo Nation 's Capital City , " Toddy said . " We have n't forgotten , but if your vehicular homicide suspect was somebody around here nobody seems to know about it . " So much for that . The day was off to a bad start . He 'd call Blizzard and tell him that he 'd deduced that Councilwoman Roanhorse was hiding Delmar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't in . Chee took the manila envelope out of the in-basket . He 'd see what Virginia had left for him . The envelope had FOR OFFICER CHEE printed across it in big letters , but nothing else . He tore it open and poured out an audiotape cassette . He turned it over . Nothing on either side to suggest what it held . He dialed Virginia to ask her who had left it . Virginia was n't at her desk . The radio on the shelf behind Lieutenant Leaphorn 's desk included a tape player . He 'd borrow that . But the lieutenant , like Virginia , and Blizzard , and  | Roanhorse , was not in . Chee left the door open behind him , turned on the radio , and slipped in the tape . It produced the buzzes and clicks characteristic of amateur taping , then ' ringing sounds , and then a voice saying , " You have reached the office of Councilman Jimmy Chester . I ca n't come to the phone now but leave a message after the beep and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then a beep , and then a second voice : " Jimmy , this is Ed Zeck . If you 're there pick it up . I need to talk to you . Otherwise , call me down at the motor inn . It 's room 217 and I 'll be there until ? " " I 'm here , Ed . What do you need ? " " I need your opinion . I hear some things that worry me . " " Like what ? " " Like maybe the American Indian Movement is going to mix into this . You hear that ? " " Forget it . AIM does n't amount to anything out here . They 're city Indians . Besides , far as Navajos are concerned , they always get on the wrong side of the argu-ment . " Chee stopped the tape . What the devil was this ? Obviously , a telephone conversation . He recognized the scratchy voice of Zeck . Presumably the man responding to Jimmy Chester 's answering machine was , as advertised , Jimmy Chester . But should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The Nature First guy ? What was his name ? Applebee . On Leaphorn 's telephone , he buzzed Virginia 's desk . Now she was there . " What package ? " Virginia asked .  | " Actually , a manila envelope . " " Not me , " Virginia said . " Somebody must have just dropped it on your desk . None of you guys ever lock a door or anything . You do n't even close them , half the time . You think nobody steals from you because you 're policemen . Well , I 'll tell you what . People walk right in here and steal your purse off your chair . Steal your jacket . I had that happen . I 've been telling the chief for years he should have a rule about keeping the doors locked . When you 're out . Or at least closing them . " Virginia paused for a breath , giving Chee an opportunity . " It makes everything more efficient , " Chee said , wondering why he was arguing about this . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and see if he 's there , or if he 's busy . That 's the way they did it at Crownpoint , too . When I was stationed there . And that 's the way it was at Tuba City . " " Well , do n't blame me , then , " Virginia said , thereby ending the conversation and leaving Chee staring at Joe Leaphorn 's radio . Maybe the tape itself would tell him who had brought it . He pushed the PLAY button . The memo he 'd written for Leaphorn yesterday was still in the lieu-tenant 's in-basket . Maybe Leaphorn was out working the Eric Dorsey case , or another crime of some importance . Or maybe he had assigned himself a drive over to Flagstaff . According to the department scuttlebutt , he was supposed to have something going with a woman professor over there . The tape stopped whirring , clicked , and abruptly began speaking in a rumbling male voice with a West Texas accent .  | " ? what I hear . But I 'll take your word for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the people at the Navajo Times ? " " Not much . I know the reporter who covers council meetings . He interviewed me last month . That 's about it . " " I did n't want to get a big argument going in the press about the dump . Silence is golden sometimes . Especially when you 're dealing with tree huggers . But the paper started running letters bitching about the project . They had one in there from a tribal cop . You think we should react ? You know , see if we can put a stop to getting politics mixed in with the Tribal Police . Lot of people would feel strongly about that , Jimmy . " " No , " Chester said . " Just hope for the best , you mean ? Hope nothing gets stirred up . " " Yes , " Chester said . " Let 's talk about my money . " The speakers emitted the tinny sound of Zeck 's laughter . " The check 's in the mail , " he said . " Just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing , " Chester said . " The bank 's not laughing . I 've got to pay off that note . Remember , it was me that signed the paper . " For a moment the only sound was the tape running . " All right then , " Zeck said . " Twenty-two thousand something . I 'll have to do some transferring around . Tell ' em you 'll have it for ' em Monday . " " And none of this check in the mail ' crap , " Chester said . " I 'll make it a cashier 's check , " Zeck said . " And what do you hear from Tano ? "  | " Nothing much . I think we 're all right there . Bert Penitewa 's for it . He 's a popular man there and Tano pretty well does what the governor wants . It 's not split like your Navajo council . There , the governor 's also the big man in one of the religious kivas . " " I know , " Chester said . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything else going on I ought to know about ? " " Nothing , " Chester said . " You go on down and get that money transferred . And it 's not twenty-two thousand something . It 's twenty-two thousand five hundred and thirty . Maybe those banks do n't charge anything to loan money to you bilagaana guys , but us Navajos have to pay interest . Twenty-two thousand five hundred and thirty . " " And some-odd cents , which we 'll round off . So yaa ' eh t'eeh for now . " There was a click , and then only the sound of the tape running . Chee let it run until it shut itself off . Then he rewound it , replayed the conversation , and rewound it again . He had decided where it must have come from . Who else but Roger Applebee ? The environmentalist had said he knew a way to get some evidence proving Jimmy Chester was corrupt . And he had gotten it . Probably with an illegal wiretap . Actually , not a wiretap these days . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversations . He 'd seen one in an electronics supply store in Farmington . But still , the tape would n't be usable in court or even before a grand jury . If it was illegal , and it probably was , how could it be used ?  | He was thinking about that when the telephone rang . " Joe Leaphorn 's office . " " Joe ? Is Jim Chee still working on that hit-and-run vehicular homicide case ? " It was the voice of the Window Rock dispatcher . " The one where ? " " This is Chee , " Chee said . " The lieutenant 's away from his office . " " Hey , man . You lucked out . Your suspect just confessed . Right over the radio . " " Confessed ? What d' ya mean ? " " He drove up to KNDN in Farmington , and walked in where they have that open mike for the public to make announcements on , and he said he did it , and he was sorry , and he was going to make restitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know he 'd hit the man . " " Who was it ? " " We have n't got him yet . He walked out and drove away . " " Wonderful , " Chee said . " Did n't they call the cops ? The people at the station ? " " I guess so . Everybody 's looking for him . Farmington police , New Mexico state cops , San Juan Sheriff 's Department . Our people at Shiprock . Everybody . " " Well , " Chee said . " I guess I 'll go join ' em . " It was three hours over the mountain to Farmington , but the hit-and-run was his baby . Jimmy Chester would have to wait .  | " WHERE ALL did you look ? " Dilly Streib asked . He was standing in the door of the Saint Bonaventure School shop , looking across the clutter . " Where ? " said Lieutenant Toddy . He waved his arms in a gesture that encompassed the cosmos . " I guess you 'd have to say everywhere . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , " Streib said . " How about you , Joe ? You got any ideas about where to start ? " Leaphorn shrugged . " It would help me if I knew what the hell we 're supposed to be looking for , " Toddy said . He started examin-  | ing the array of chisels , awls , punches , hammers , nail sets , files , and planes racked on the wall . Streib maintained his position , leaning against the doorjamb . " If you ask Lieutenant Leaphorn that question , he 'll tell you to look for clues . Then you ask him how you know it 's a clue , and he 'll give you a wise look . " " I 'm in favor of just looking , " Leaphorn said . " You never know what you 'll find . " " That 's Joe 's theory , " Streib said . " You do n't look for anything in particular . You just look and if you look long enough you reach retirement age . " " At exactly the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " How about this ? " Lieutenant Toddy asked . He showed Leaphorn a mallet . " Could that be blood ? " Leaphorn looked at it , scraped with a thumbnail , showed the result to Toddy . " Dried paint , " Toddy said . " I 'll tell you what we 're looking for , " said Streib . " We hope to discover a Polaroid photo of Eugene Ahkeah with his bludgeon raised , about to hit Mr. Dorsey on the back of the head . See if he left it in the wastebasket . " Toddy was not enjoying Streib 's humor . " We went through the wastebaskets . Went through everything . " " I was just kidding , " Streib said . He pushed himself off from the doorjamb and began opening drawers . " I wonder what these things could be for . " He displayed a small , shallow wooden box . " They 're forms for sand-casting metal , " Toddy said . " You put wet sand in and make the shape in it that you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what-  | ever you 're working with . That one looks like the size you 'd use to cast a belt buckle . " " How about this one ? " Streib handed Toddy a much deeper box , almost a cube . " Maybe some sort of jewelry ? " " No idea , " Toddy said . He put it on the workbench . Leaphorn picked it up . It was newer than the more standard casting forms and looked carefully made . The sand inside it was packed hard and crusted by the intense heat of the metal it had formed . He stared at the indentation . An odd shape . What could it have been ? One of those fancy desk cigarette lighters maybe . But it looked too round for the Aladdin 's lamp shape favored for those . In fact , the shape pressed into the sand must have been close to a perfect hemisphere . Maybe just a little ovoid . But Leaphorn now saw it had had lettering on it . He could make out the shape of what might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eighteen . But what next ? Beyond the eight was a mostly erased shape that might have been a six , but the sand was too disturbed to keep a legible imprint . He placed the form carefully in the drawer of the workbench . He 'd waste a little time later trying to find out which student was working with it and what sort of object the box was forming . They spent almost an hour in the shop before Toddy declared the press of duty at Crownpoint and left . Streib decided he should question Mission volunteers again . He disappeared toward the living quarters . l.eaphorn remained . Except for the sand-cast form , he had found nothing that provoked interest except some shavings from a wood much heavier and darker than  | the oak , fir , and pine that almost everyone seemed to be using . Nor did it match the various half-finished tables , benches , table-lamp bases , rolling pins , and kitchen shelves racked in the workshop storeroom . Leaphorn put a sample of it in an envelope and into his pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or perhaps he would simply forget it . It had more relevance to his personal curiosity than to this homicide investigation . It had always seemed to Leaphorn that the question without a satisfactory answer in this affair was why it had happened . If a man was drunk enough , not much motive was required . But Ahkeah had to have had some reason . Dilly suggested that he 'd run out of whiskey money , had come here to borrow from Dorsey , had been turned down , and had killed Dorsey in the resulting rage . And if a drunk Ahkeah 's reason had been money , why had n't he sold the silver ingots he 'd taken ? It would have been easy enough to cash them in . Why stash them away in a box under his house ? Any pawnshop in Gallup or Grants , or any of the places that sold supplies to jewelers , would buy them . Or , if he was worried about the sale being traced , Ahkeah probably knew a dozen Navajos or Zunis or Acomas or Lagunas  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were making silver stuff and who would n't ask questions if the price was right . Leaphorn still had motive on his mind as he worked his way methodically through the grade books he 'd found in a workbench drawer . He was reading the man 's notes on class projects when he heard Father Haines . The priest was standing hesitantly at the door , a thin , gray man , slightly bent .  | " Any luck ? " " None , " said Leaphorn , who had never believed in luck . He motioned Haines toward the chair beside him and carefully removed the cube-shaped form from the drawer . " You have any idea what this form is for ? " Father Haines inspected it , frowned , shook his head . " It looks like there might have been some writing pressed down in there . Maybe it was some sort of medal . A trophy for something . " " It looks like the wrong shape , " Leaphorn said . " I think it must have been something sort of round  --  like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He always tried to get the kids to make useful things . Or things they could sell . " Haines laughed . " I think Bonaventure School is flooding the market with authentic Navajo sand-cast silver belt buckles and bracelets and so forth . " " And it sounds like ? " Leaphorn tapped Dorsey 's class notes . " ? these kids were making pretty good stuff . " Haines laughed . " Actually , some of them were . Some of these kids are really talented . But Eric had this policy of trying to make these youngsters feel a little more artistic than they actually were . I do n't think he ever saw a student-made belt buckle he could n't find something good to say about . " " There was n't much turquoise here , " Leaphorn said . " Was it all accounted for ? " " Probably . He did n't ever have much . No budget for it . If one of the boys was doing something special , he 'd usually just dig up some money and buy some stones in Gallup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eugene did it , do you ? "  | " I do n't know . You saw the box they found under his place . It looks like he was the one . " They thought about it . Father Haines had been on the reservation long enough to have learned from the Dine'e something that some whites never learn in a life-time  --  that there 's nothing wrong with mutual silence . The clock above the door made one of those sounds that old electric clocks sometimes make . The high notes of a shout and a dog barking drifted faintly through the glass . All the smells of a high-school crafts shop were in the air around them  --  machine oil , wood shavings , resin , turpentine , wax , paint , sawdust . Healthy smells , Leaphorn thought , that covered up the smell of a good man 's blood . " Last winter Eric and some of the rest of us had gone down to that big Giant Truck Stop beside Interstate 40 . We were having dinner at the coffee shop there . Eric got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nephews ? was calling from here to tell him that Eugene was having car trouble . So Eric wraps his hamburger and his fries in a napkin and says he has to go . I remember I said , Eugene can wait a little while . Sit down and finish your supper . ' And I said , He 's probably half-drunk anyway ? feeling no pain . ' And Eric said , Yeah , that 's why I 've got to hurry . " So " So you do n't think Eugene killed him . " " I do n't know , " Haines said . " With whiskey involved , you ca n't tell . Mothers kill their children when they 're drunk . Or drink when they 're pregnant , which is about as bad as killing them . " But , Leaphorn was thinking , even with whiskey  | there has to be some sort of reason . Something to ignite the lethal rage . He extracted the envelope from his pocket , shook the shaving onto his palm , and showed it to the priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It looks like it came off a table leg or something like that . It looks like a shaving from a lathe . " " What kind of wood ? " Haines inspected it . " Dark and tough , " he said . " I know what it 's not . It 's not any kind of pine , or fir , or cedar , or oak unless there 's some species that has a darker color . It 's not redwood . I 'm pretty sure it 's not mahogany and I know it 's not maple . " " Something exotic , " Leaphorn said . " Maybe teak or ebony or something like that . " " I guess so , " Haines said . " I have an idea that ebony is real black and teak 's lighter . Maybe ebony . But I 'm no expert . " " How often is this room swept out ? Cleaned ? " " Every evening , " Haines said . " Dorsey did it himself . He was a very neat man . " He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you walked in here when a class was n't in session you 'd find it slick as a whistle . No sawdust anywhere . Working surfaces all clear . Everything in its place . Not like this . " He made a disapproving face at the cluttered room . " But after we found Eric 's body , and the police came , they asked us to lock the room and not touch anything until the investigation was finished . " Leaphorn laid the shaving on the desk . " There was quite a bit of this dark stuff over by the lathe and some more of it over on the bench with the woodworking 155   vise . So I guess it had to get there the morning he was killed . " " Yes , " Haines said . " Eric always swept up . And he used one of those shop vacuums and a dust cloth . He said that was one of the things he wanted to teach the kids . You want to be a craftsman , or an artist , you have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did he allow some of the students to take out the projects they were working on ? " Haines looked surprised . " I do n't think so , " he said . " Maybe if they were sanding something . Something they could do at home . But the silversmithing projects , we kept them locked up in the storeroom . " Leaphorn touched the shaving with his finger . He said , " I searched through the storeroom , and every place in here I can think of . I ca n't find anything that looks like this wood . " " Oh , " said Father Haines . He considered . " Maybe one of the students was working on ? " He left the sentence unfinished . " Maybe , " Leaphorn said . " We 'll talk to the students and find out what everybody was doing in woodworking . But Dorsey kept a list of what the kids were making . Nothing looked like it would be using a fancy wood . " " So you 're thinking that maybe ? " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to see if I can find it there . " And he was also thinking that he would do a little crossing of jurisdictional lines . Dilly Streib could arrange it for him . They 'd make a trip to Tano Pueblo just as Jim Chee had suggested in that memo he 'd left . Leaphorn  | had decided as soon as he 'd read it that he wanted to find out what was in the wagon the clown was pulling . What was it that had caused the people of Tano to quit laughing and suddenly become serious ? And he wanted to see if he could find something made of heavy , dark wood in the place where Francis Sayesva stayed when he came home to Tano . Came home to educate his people , or maybe to warn them about something . And to die .  | SAMMIE YAllIE seemed to be in charge of radio station KNDN when Chee pulled up off of Farmington 's Main Street into the parking lot . He was about Chee 's age , with a neat mustache , a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed the excitement of broadcasting a confession earlier in the day it had worn off long ago . " I do n't know what else I can tell you . Like I told the deputy , and the Farmington police , and the state cops , and the tribal policeman who got here this morning , the guy just walked in and went to the open mike there and did his thing . "  | " I 've got the police report , " Chee said , displaying the copy he picked up at the Farmington police station . " It gives the facts : medium-sized , middle-aged male , probably Navajo , dressed in jeans and jean jacket and billed cap with Cat symbol on crown , wearing darkrimmed glasses , driving a dirty green pickup , possibly Ford 150 or Dodge Ram . Parked in front , walked in , went to the open mike , said he wanted to broadcast an announcement . Was told to wait until end of record . Waited . Was given signal . Then he made his statement , walked out . Drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " That 's what happened . Except I think Ellie told the officers that she could n't read the license plate when she went to the window to look . And the bumper sticker . " " Yeah . That 's in here . " He read again : " ' License obscured by dirt . Witness noticed sticker on tailgate : ERNIE IS THE GREATEST . ' That 's a funny thing to put on a sticker . You have any idea where it 's from ? " Yazzie shrugged . " That 's a new one to me . Maybe it 's one of those you get made up . Like , My kid 's an honor student at Farmington High . ' Or My kid can whip your honor student at Farmington High. - " Maybe , " Chee said . " How about shoes ? Boots ? " " You better talk to Ellie , " Yazzie said . " She got the best look at him . " Ellie looked like she was about a year out of high school and was still enjoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Boots ? " she said , and closed her eyes to show that she was thinking hard and had long , pretty eyelashes .  | " No . He had on high-top work shoes . I remember because I noticed he had tracked in dirt and I looked . " " Anything else ? That might be useful ? " " How would the boots be useful ? " " Well , " Chee said . " What if he was wearing tall laceup boots ? That might tell us he worked for the telephone company . Or the power company . A lineman . Pole climber . " " Oh , " Ellie said . " Or if he wore those big heavy shoes with the steel cap in the toe , maybe for the pipeline com-pany . " " Right , " Chee said , returning her grin . " Now if we 're lucky you 'll remember he had a patch on his jacket that said MEMBER SAN JUAN COUNTY SHERIFF 'S POSSE , Or LIONS CLUB . Something easy like that . " Ellie displayed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I just remember he looked sort of nervous and scared , but that 's not unusual . Lot of people are nervous when they pick up the mike . You know . About to broadcast on the radio . And he was kind of old . " Chee looked at the report . " It says middle-aged here . Was he older than middle-aged ? " " That 's kind of old , " she said , and shrugged . " You know . Maybe past thirty . And nervous . " It would be natural to be nervous , Chee was thinking , when you 're going to tell the world you killed some-body . " Nervous , you said . But he did n't ask anybody how to use the microphone ? How to turn it on ? How far to hold it from his face ? Any of that ? "  | " I do n't think so . " " He just picked it up and seemed to know how to do all the right things ? " " Yeah , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the people who come in to make announcements need to be told . You know , they 're from out in the country . Wanting to announce a funeral , or a sing , or a Girl Dance , or a meeting of the grazing committee at their chapter house . Something like that . And they do n't know anything about using a microphone . " " One other thing , " Chee said . " I understand these open mike announcements are taped while they 're broadcast . " " That 's a government requirement , " Ellie said . " We have to do that . It 's automatic . " " Could I get a copy ? " " We already made one for the sheriff , " Ellie said . " And for the Farmington cops . " " How about for me ? " Ellie inspected him , and giggled . " Why not ? " she said . " You 'll have to wait a minute . " While he waited , Chee peered out into the parking lot at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this range he could n't read the COURTEOUS DRIVING SAVES LIVES Or the BUCKLE UP , IT 'S THE LAW stickers on his own bumper . He made out the National Rifle Association membership sticker on the adjoining truck only because it was familiar . If Ellie had read the Ernie sticker on the suspect 's truck it must have been printed large . He 'd ask about that when she got back , which was at that very moment .  | " Here it is , " she said , handing him a cassette . " No charge to a policeman . " " Thanks , " Chee said . " You remember where the man 's pickup was parked ? " " Right there , " she said , pointing . " The nearest spot . " " You 're certain about what the bumper sticker said ? The report says the truck was muddy . There was dirt on the license plate . " " Not on the sticker , " Ellie said . " It looked brand-new . And it was great big . The letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " thanks a lot . " He handed her two cards , one identifying him as a Navajo Tribal Policeman and giving his office number , the other identifying him as a hataalii and a singer of the Blessing Way and giving the number of the telephone in his trailer . " Home and office , " he explained . " Would you give me a call if you think of anything else ? Anything at all that might help me find this guy . " " The only other thing I can think of that was funny was the cap he had on . " Ellie blinked at him , exposing eyelashes against a smooth cheek . " Funny like how ? " " I do n't mean ha-ha funny . Funny strange . It was one of those baseball caps like everybody wears but it looked like somebody had sat on the bill . It went out straight from the crown and then it was bent up , like this . " Ellie raised her right hand to her forehead . She recreated with her fingers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill was broken . " She made a disapproving face . " That was a good thing to notice , " Chee said , smiling  | at her . " It 's the sort of unusual thing which might help us find him . Can you think of anything else ? " Ellie 's expression said she was trying . She thought of something , considered it , looked doubtful , went back to thinking . " You thought of something , " Chee said . " What was it ? " She giggled . " I do n't see how this will help . But I remember the funny way he smelled . " She wrinkled her nose , and laughed . " He smelled like onions . " " I 'll bet he 'd been eating a hamburger , " Chee said . " Maybe a Lottaburger . They have lots of onions . " Which was the reason Chee favored them himself . " No , " she said . " It was morning . And it was his clothing , I think . Strong enough to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards he 'd given her . " You 're a hataalii , " she said , looking up at him . " Really ? I did n't know you can be a medicine man and a policeman at the same time . " " I 'm beginning to think you ca n't , " Chee said .  | ON HIS WAY out to his pickup Chee decided his next step would be to check places in Farmington where bumper stickers were printed . Probably he 'd find no more than one or two . He 'd ask at the city police station and check the telephone book . And when he 'd found the one that had printed the ERNIE IS THE GREATEST business he would have another shot at finding the cold-blooded bastard he was looking for . Then he 'd complete this investigation . He 'd make the arrest . He would impress Lieutenant Leaphorn , sew on his sergeant stripes , and add about five hundred bucks to his monthly income . Then he would be in much better shape to persuade Janet to  | marry him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People Clan did n't link with one of his own and make her his sister and therefore sexually taboo . And if Janet would forgive him for the clumsy way he 'd handled that . If he 'd done it as badly as he remembered , that did n't seem likely . Finally , there was the original question of whether a sophisticated , urbane graduate of Stanford Law School and member of the bar would marry a sheep camp boy turned cop , under any circumstances . And what if she was a clan sister ? What would he do then ? Chee did n't want to think about it . He drove down Main toward the police station deliberately not thinking about it . Instead , he got himself better organized mentally on the Lieutenant Leaphorn front . Leaphorn had made it abundantly clear that his help would not be welcomed by the BIA nor by the Albuquerque FBI in the Sayesva homicide . " Stay away from Tano " was the lieu-tenant 's final instruction . And then there was the matter of the Councilman Chester bribery business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that tape he 'd left in the tape player on the lieutenant 's desk . Not that much explanation would be needed . It would be clear enough to Leaphorn . Someone had tapped Jimmy Chester 's telephone  --  or maybe Ed Zeck 's . Ed Zeck was an old-time Indian Country lawyer  --  a regular lobbyist at tribal council meetings . So you had a tape of Chester dunning Zeck for his bribe money . A very businesslike arrangement , so it sounded . It sounded as if Chester was accumulating interest on his twenty-grand payoff . And apparently Chester had borrowed it from the bank to be  | paid back when Zeck delivered the money . Sort of an advance , or maybe a way to launder it . Such high finance , the way banks operated , was far , far from Chee 's zone of expertise . The Farmington police , it turned out , were way ahead of Chee . Chee was referred to Sergeant Eddie Bell . " We handled that right after it happened , " Bell said . " There 're seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but two will do bumper stickers if you want a thousand or so , and three of ' em would run off a single if you were willing to pay the preparation cost , and not a damn one of them remembered doing an ERNIE IS THE GREATEST job . " " Well , hell , " Chee said . " You 'd think somebody would remember an odd one like that . It would have to be one of those places that does singles , I 'd think . " This concept was new to Chee . He had admired thousands of bumper stickers , from assurances that God loved him , to recommendations for saving the planet , to obscenities , to dire warnings about following too closely . Declarations of RED POWER , and even one that simply said BUMPER STICKER . But he 'd never given a thought to where they came from . " Do they do that ? " he asked Bell . " You just walk in and tell them what you want and they print you one ? " " Sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next block will run one off for you in five minutes . But it 's pretty expensive that way . Not like so much a thousand . So they do n't do many , and everyone we talked to says they thought they 'd remember that ERNIE IS THE GREATEST . It 's sort of weird . "  | " I guess he must have got it printed somewhere else , " Chee said . Sergeant Bell 's expression said he thought that was a statement too obvious to need saying . " We asked for checks of printers at Albuquerque , and Gallup , and Flagstaff , and Phoenix . So far they all came up blank . But you know how that is . " " Yeah , " Chee said . People tended to be way too busy to do other people 's work . Or to do it well . He was disappointed and Bell saw it . " Look . If you 're going to keep working on this sticker business , be careful with it . It 's an easy one to spot . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll scrape it off . And if he does n't scrape it off , we 're going to have him sooner or later . " Now Bell also had said something too obvious to need saying . They were even . And Chee was back to square one . The only thing he had that probably had n't been worked by the state cops , or the Farmington police , or the San Juan County Sheriff , was the smell of onions . The man must have smelled strongly  --  not just onion breath . And it was , as Ellie had said , too early to be eating hamburgers . She 'd said it seemed like the odor came from his clothing , and it must have been powerful . Chee drove down to the Garden Spot Produce Company on West Main , checked the vehicles parked there without scoring a green pickup with an ERNIE IS THE GREATEST sticker , and parked himself . He 'd scanned through the typed copy of his man 's confession which Bell had given him . Now he got out the taped copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player .  | The voice was that of a young woman , talking in halting Navajo . Chee frowned . They 'd given him the wrong tape . The woman was reporting the death of her maternal aunt , obviously reading something that had been written for her in English and stumbling over the translation . The family was getting together at the home of the deceased in Mexican Water to talk about what to do with her horses , and her grazing lease , and other property , and there was going to be a funeral service at the Assembly of God Mission at Kayenta . The halting voice told Chee that the woman was born to the Streams Come Together People and born for the Towering House Clan . But , Chee thought , whatever her clans , she had gone onto the Jesus Road . Before he could ponder that and whether it would affect the incest taboo , another voice came on . " I tell the family of Hosteen Todachene that I am sorry . I heard the truck hit something , but I was drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't drink hardly ever so when I did drink that night I got drunk . I would have helped him if I knew he was there . Now I am sorry . I will send money every two weeks to help make up for the help he gave you . I want you to know I am sorry . " End of tape . Chee rewound it and played it again . The words rushed out  --  a man tense with emotion and , understandably , in a hurry . He played it again . The speech sounded memorized , as if the man had written it out . He must have thought about it a lot . In this third time through Chee was impressed with the emotion . The man sounded as if he were holding back tears . He switched off the tape , turned on the radio ,  | punched the AM button . At the moment , KNDN was broadcasting a singer asking , " Why did you leave me , Lucille , with three little children and a crop in the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat trying to visualize the man . Medium-sized , middle-aged , Ellie had said , wearing jeans and a jean jacket and a baseball cap with a long bill bent up in the middle like somebody had sat on it . On the tape he sounded like a childhood Navajo speaker  --  probably not boarding school . A lot of middle-aged Navajos had a limited vocabulary in their language because in those days the BIA would n't let them speak it in school and that was the age period when you grow out of your childhood vocabulary . This man spoke it well . He knew the verbs to convert an English-language situation into fluent Navajo . Chee switched off the radio and went into the produce store . The clerk pointed him to a telephone . He called the Farmington Police number . Yes , Sergeant Bell was in . " You know in that broadcast , the man said he was going to send money to the Todachene family , " Chee said . " Do you know if he 's done it ? " " He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He laughed . " Unfortunately , he forgot to put his return address on the envelope . " " Was it mailed around here ? " " Farmington postmark , " Bell said . " Apparently he mailed it two days after he ran over the guy . " " How much ? " " Six twenties , two tens , and a five , " Bell said . " Wish he 'd sent a check . "  | " That 'd be a hundred and forty-five dollars , " Chee said . " Does that mean anything to you ? The amount ? " " Not a damn thing , " Bell said . " At least he did n't spend it getting drunk again . " " Well , " Chee said , " thanks . If I learn anything I 'll let you know . But I have n't got much hope . " " Hey , by the way , did you hear it happened again ? Down at your place this time ? " " What happened ? " " Somebody showed up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Navajo Tractor Company beside the highway . This guy walked in and broadcast a tape of one of your tribal councilmen talking about a bribe . " Chee sucked in his breath . " Did what ? " " I did n't hear it , " Bell said . " But we got a bunch of calls about it and somebody went down to see about it . They told him this guy walked into the dealership there and got in line with the people waiting to broadcast their announcements . The microphone 's in a little box on the wall in the lobby and you just wait your turn . He said , What you are about to hear is telephone talk between tribal councilman so-and-so and such-and-such , the lobbyist for some company or other . ' And then he played this conversation . Held his little tape recorder up to the mike . " " Be damned , " Chee said . " Who was it ? " " Who knows . People come in every day during the noon hour to make announcements and nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last one at the station in Farmington. "  | " Did you get a description ? " " Not much of one . White man . Maybe five-eight or - ten . Maybe forty or forty-five . Had a jacket on and a hat . Nothing on what he was driving , or how he got there . The manager said there 's always a line of Navajos coming in to use the mike during that period for making announcements . The people working there are selling tractors , farm equipment , and stuff , and not paying attention to the mike . It 's just a public service gimmick with the station . Probably they get a trade-out on their radio advertising or something . " " That description does n't narrow it down much , " Chee said . It did n't need to be narrowed down for him . The man would be Roger Applebee . Applebee had found a way to use an illegal tape that could n't be used in court . He hung up and stood with his hand still on the telephone , considering his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of trouble , he had no doubt of that . But it was n't his trouble . Not unless the lieutenant changed his mind and let him investigate what was going on with the toxic-waste-dump business . That was n't likely . His trouble was the Todachene hit-and-run . Chee 's thoughts turned to the six twenties , two tens , and one five , and to the voice of a man promising to send money every two weeks . " Thanks for the telephone , " he said to the clerk . " Could I ask you something sort of semi-personal ? " The clerk looked doubtful . " Do you people working here get paid once a month , or once a week , or every two weeks , or what ? "  | " Once a week , " the clerk said . That took care of that . The bins beside him were stacked with fruit . Oranges , then three varieties of apples , then pears , then bananas , then grapes . Bins along the wall held a mountain of potatoes , then yams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then onions , then The clerk was counting out change for a customer . " Where do you get your onions ? " Chee asked . " Onions ? " the clerk asked . Chee pointed . " Onions , " he repeated . " I think they 're local , " the clerk said . " Yeah , we get them from NAI . " " From Navajo Agricultural Industries ? " Chee said . " Right over across the river ? " " That 's right , " the clerk said , but Chee was already heading for the door . Why had n't he thought of that ?  | EVEN BEFORE he had finished reading Chee 's memo , Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn had come to a couple of conclusions . The first was that he had guessed right about Chee . He was young , and he still had the crazy idea that he could be both a hataalii and a tribal cop simultaneously , and he had a tendency to do things his own way . But he was smart . And in this job , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The second conclusion was t hat he should clear up this question of the link between Eric Dorsey and Francis Sayesva now , and the place to start was exactly in the unlikely place that 's Chee 's memo had suggested .  | He picked up the cap he 'd just taken off and headed for the door . The first step was to talk to Dilly Streib . Streib would probably still be lingering over his breakfast at the Navajo Nation Inn , where Leaphorn had just left him . He 'd get Dilly to make the proper calls to assure that no jurisdictional toes were bruised . Then he 'd make the long drive to Tano . Perhaps Dilly would like to go along . Dilly would n't . He called the Albuquerque FBI office , and got the proper people at the BIA Law and Order Division to set things up across the jurisdictional boundaries . But as far as making the trip was concerned , he told Leaphorn , " Sorry , I got other sheep to shear . " Maybe you 've got the time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not me , " Streib said . " Besides , my tailbone 's hurting from all the driving we 've been doing . " So , a little before noon , Leaphorn arrived at Tano , stopped at the pueblo administrative office , asked appropriate questions , and got directions to the house of Teddy Sayesva . Teddy Sayesva showed no enthusiasm for giving a Navajo policeman the fifth repetition , as he put it , " of what damn little I know about how my brother got killed . " But the Tano culture 's demand for hospitality quickly overpowered his irritation . He prepared coffee in the pot on the cookstove , and then perched stiffly on the edge of a kitchen chair  --  a small , thin man with a burr haircut and wire-rimmed glasses that looked too youthful for a face that was lined and tired . No , he had n't been at home when his nephew had come to see his brother Francis . He  | was a member of a kachina society and had duties to take care of at the kiva society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been home to witness , he could think of nothing unusual happening that evening . He recited what had happened as if he 'd memorized it . Francis had driven in from his home in Albuquerque early in the afternoon . As always during ceremonials , he used Teddy 's place as his home base . At supper he 'd seemed preoccupied , maybe worried , but Teddy presumed that was because he had to go the next week to testify before a federal grand jury . Teddy paused after mentioning that and glanced at Leaphorn to see if it needed explanation . It did n't . Leaphorn had read of that in the FBI report . It seemed to involve an auditing technicality in a banking case with no connection to this homicide . Leaphorn nodded . Teddy resumed his recitation . Teddy had left for the preceremonial meeting at his kiva . When he got home , Francis was in bed , sound asleep . He was still asleep when Teddy had left the next morning before dawn for prayers at the kiva . " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teddy said , looking down at his hands as he said it . " The last time I saw Francis he was sleeping . " He pointed into the next room . " Sleeping in that bed there . Where we both used to sleep when we were boys . " " That would be a hard loss , " Leaphorn said . He thought of telling the man of Emma 's death , comparing the loss of the wife of your lifetime to the loss of a brother . But he could see no consolation in that . For either of them . Instead he said :  | " The FBI agent 's report indicates that you had no idea what your nephew brought over here that night to give to Francis . Is that correct ? " " No idea , " Teddy Sayesva said . " The man told me it was supposed to be something long and narrow and wrapped in a newspaper . Like I said , I was n't here when Delmar came with it . And I did n't see anything like that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't see anything different at all . " He gestured , taking in the small , cluttered room . " Where would you put something in here where I would n't notice it ? Right here in my own house . Anyplace he might have put it , we 've looked . We did n't find anything . " " We think it might have been something made of wood . Of a heavy dark wood , " Leaphorn said . " Oh , " Teddy Sayesva said . His tone indicated that this interested him . " Your nephew said this object , whatever it was , had religious significance , " Leaphorn added . " That it had something to do with the ceremonial . " " Delmar told you that ? " Sayesva 's expression showed his shock . " He should n't ? " He let the sentence hang . Leaphorn cleared his throat . " Actually , he told the officer that he could n't talk about what was in the package . He said he could n't talk about it at all because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion to anyone not initiated into his kiva . " " Oh , " Teddy Sayesva said . He looked relieved . " That 's right . He could n't talk about it if it concerned his religious duties . "  | " And he did n't talk about it , " Leaphorn said . " When the BIA officer told him he would have to take him in to Albuquerque to be questioned by the FBI if he did n't tell them what it was , then Delmar ran away . " Sayesva nodded , approving both Delmar 's action and this Navajo 's understanding of it . He got up , walked quickly to the door , opened it , and stood for a moment looking out into the cold autumn sunlight . A pickup truck rolled down the alley past the porch . Teddy Sayesva waved , and shouted something unintelligible to those who do n't speak the language of Tano . Then he looked up and down the street again , shut the door , and sat down . " You 're Navajo , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pueblos ? Are any of your family married into our people ? " Leaphorn said no . " I will have to tell you a little bit about our religion then , " Sayesva said . " Nothing secret . " He produced a wry smile . " Just former secrets  --  things that the anthropologists have already written about . " He got up , poured coffee from the steaming pot , handed a mug to Leaphorn , and sat again . " You know my brother was the leader of our koshare society . Do you know about the koshares ? " " A little , " Leaphorn said . " I 've watched them at kachina dances . The clowns , with the striped body paint , making people laugh . I know their duties are more than just to entertain . " " In our pueblo , and in some of the others , men who have jobs in towns and live away from us ca n't be mem-  | bers of the most sacred societies , the kachina societies . They ca n't spend enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that is sacred too , but in a different way . " He paused , seeking a way to explain . " To outsiders , they look like clowns and what they do looks like clowning . Like foolishness . But it is more than that . The koshare have another role . I guess you could say they are our ethical police . It 's their job to remind us when we drift away from the way that was taught us . They show us how far short we humans are of the perfection of the spirits . " He paused , an opportunity for a question . Leaphorn said , " An old friend of mine , a Hopi , told me their koshares are like policemen who use laughter instead of guns and scorn instead of jails . " Sayesva nodded . " You 've been to kachina ceremonials , " he said . " Lots of Navajos like to come to them . " " Sure , " Leaphorn agreed . " We are taught to respect your religion . " " Then you 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greedy , reminding us of how badly we behave . That 's the purpose . If you had been to this last one , you would have seen the clowns come in . They work with the clown team , to help teach the lesson . This time one of the clowns pulled in a wagon , and one of my cousins was there with the big billfold and the big dollars play-acting , pretending to buy sacred things . That 's what my brother had decided to warn the people about that day . Selling things they should n't sell . What Delmar brought him in that pack-  | age , I do n't know . But I think it must have been something to put into the little wagon . Something symbolic . " Teddy Sayesva looked at Leaphorn over his glasses . Shrugged . Sipped his coffee . " Something made of dark wood and silver ? " Leaphorn said . Sayesva looked up from his cup , shook his head , produced a wry smile . " Silver , too ? Black wood and silver ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casting something in metal . About this big . " Leaphorn made a small , round shape with his hands . " And with letters in it . " " Found it where ? " " In the school crafts shop at Thoreau . " " Where that man was killed ? " Leaphorn nodded . " Do you know what it was ? " Sayesva 's expression said he knew , and that the knowledge hurt . But he did n't answer the question . " Whatever it was , it seems to have been made in the shop that morning . We think Mr. Dorsey probably made it . We think it was taken about the time he was killed . Maybe before , maybe after , but about that time . A friend of Delmar 's says Delmar went to the shop about that time to pick up something the friend had made . When the friend came to pick up Delmar , Delmar had the package with him . " Sayesva shook his head , rejecting what he was fearing . He looked very tired . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . " We have a suspect in jail at Crownpoint , " he said . " He 's a Navajo named Eugene Ahkeah , a maintenance man at the school . He was seen  | before . Warned against selling sacred things , I mean . But the cane was another matter . There are n't any rules , exactly , about what the clowns can do , or what they can ridicule . But they do follow traditions . And traditionally , the clowns do n't get involved in politics and they do n't get personally insulting . Putting that cane in there was like accusing Bert of being willing to sell it  --  and God knows what some collector would pay for something that old and sent out by Abraham Lincoln himself . It would be a personal insult because the governor is the keeper of the cane . A sort of a sacred trust . " " So that broke with tradition ? I mean putting the cane in the wagon ? " Sayesva nodded . " Everybody 's been talking about it . Maybe as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Francis was a valuable man . He did n't do foolish things . People wonder what he was telling them . " " If your brother did n't have that cane made , do you have any idea who might have done it ? " Sayesva thought , shook his head . " No idea . " They sat , with Teddy Sayesva considering what he now knew along with what he had known before  --  considering how a cane taken from a murdered man 's shop came to be made part of the symbolic cargo of a clown 's toy wagon . Leaphorn was content to give him time . He let his eyes wander . Sayesva 's kitchen was the kitchen of a man who lived alone . Leaphorn saw the same untidy clues he saw in his house since Emma 's death , the grimy stove , the cluttered sink , the unkempt shelves . He saw the sad look of loneliness .  | " I talked to Henry Agoyo , " Sayesva said , finally . " Henry is the chief clown  --  the one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sayesva hesitated , looked at Leaphorn , made a wry face , and continued . " I 'm talking too much . About things we do n't talk about . But something very strange has happened here . I think we should try to understand it . I talked to Henry . I asked him what he knew about putting the cane in the wagon . Why in the world did they do that ? He said it was n't planned that way . He said Francis brought it to him that morning ? just a little while before the ceremonial started . He said Francis told him to put it in the wagon , and he did n't want to do it . But he said Francis seemed very upset . Disturbed . He said put it in and Henry said , Do you know what you 're doing , ' or something like that , and Francis said he was n't sure , and maybe he was wrong , and he hoped he was wrong , but to put the cane in the wagon . " Sayesva picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down again . " Henry knew my brother real well , " Sayesva said . " They were in the same class in school and they both drove trucks at the Jacks Wild Mine , before Francis went to the university to become an accountant . " " What does Agoyo do now ? " Leaphorn asked . " He runs a road grader for the county . " " He said Francis hoped he was wrong , " Leaphorn repeated . Sayesva nodded . " Anything else ? Could he tell you where the cane is now ? What happened to it after the ceremonial ? " " lie said Francis came when the clowns left the  | plaza and said he had to have the cane , and took it out of the wagon . " Leaphorn connected his memory of what Chee had described with this new fact . There had been very little time between the end of the clowning skit and the death of Francis Sayesva in the room where he had gone to remove his costume . Only the few minutes Chee had spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cane with him when he was killed , He thought : Find the cane , find the killer . " So putting the cane in the wagon was a last-second addition , " Leaphorn said . " They had n't planned it that way . " " That 's what Henry Agoyo told me . " " You think probably your brother did n't know about the cane until Delmar brought it to him ? " " That 's what I think , " Sayesva said . " So what was that shop teacher 's motive for making it ? " Leaphorn asked , as much to himself as to Sayesva . " And why was the shop teacher killed ? " Neither of them could think of an answer .  | NOR COULD Bert Penitewa , the governor of Tano Pueblo . Leaphorn had walked from Sayesva 's house , across the plaza and around a corner and down a narrow street walled with adobe houses . As Sayesva had told him , the governor 's home was the third on the left . A middle-aged woman answered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head . Yes , Governor Penitewa was home . She was his daughter and she had to run to see about something a neighbor had asked her to do . But she ushered him in , invited him to sit on the sagging sofa , called her father , and left .  | The governor of Tano Pueblo was a short , heavybodied man , probably in his late seventies . But like many of his race , he did n't show his age . His hair was thick and black , his face hardly lined , and while his belly bulged over the belt of his jeans , his back still resisted the slump of the aged . " I 'm sorry Della had to leave in such a hurry , " he said . " She makes much better coffee than I do and I want to offer you a cup . " " I 'm afraid I 've already had my quota for the day , " Leaphorn said . Penitewa gestured him back onto the sagging sofa by the front window and seated himself behind a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind the desk , Leaphorn could see into the bedroom from which the governor had emerged . To his left , a doorway opened into the kitchen . To his right he could see into what seemed to be another bedroom . This living room was small , crowded with worn furnishings , its plank floor covered with a good Navajo rug , its walls decorated with photographs and a framed print of Christ crucified . Beside the kitchen door a shelf held three kachina figures , a seed basket , two good examples of Acoma pottery , and a plastic clock made to represent a coyote howling . On the wall behind the table where Penitewa sat , two canes hung side by side . One was made of a light wood with a head of heavy ornate silver tied with a black cord and dangling a black tassel . The other was a simple ebony stick with a round silver head . The Lincoln Cane . " How about iced tea ? I should offer you something , " Penitewa said . " I presume this is an official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That has n't happened at this pueblo for many , many years . " Leaphorn was n't quite sure how that remark was intended . As he remembered history , Tano had been hostile to the Navajos during what Frank Sam Nakai called " the Kit Carson wars . " But then , just about all the Pueblos had joined the Americans in that campaign . Only Jemez Pueblo had remained forever friendly . " I think the best we could call this visit is semioffi-cial , " Leaphorn said . " We had a teacher killed on our reservation a little while ago . " He explained the evidence that the victim- had made a copy of the Tano Lincoln Cane , that a Navajo suspected of the homicide was in custody , and that Delmar Kanitewa had apparently brought the cane to Tano and had given it to Francis Sayesva , and that it had subsequently been taken when Sayesva was killed . Penitewa listened in silence , motionless , face impassive . But his eyes betrayed surprise and interest . " So , that 's it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Apparently , that 's it , " Leaphorn said . " The evidence is circumstantial . But it 's strong . We found shavings of what looks like ebony wood in the teacher 's shop , and what seemed to be a mold to cast the silver head . The Kanitewa boy was there at the right time . He brought a package of the proper shape and gave it to Francis Sayesva . But , of course , we have n't actually had our hands on it . " " I saw it in the wagon , " Penitewa said . " It was quite a shock . At first I thought it was the real one . I thought someone had come in here and got it down off the wall . "  | " Could that have happened ? " Governor Penitewa smiled at him . " It could have , but it did n't . I came right home to look and it was still on the wall . " He turned and pointed . " There 's the original . Would you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaphorn said . He glanced at his watch . Penitewa hoisted himself out of the chair , took the black cane from the wall , and handed it to Leaphorn . The weight surprised Leaphorn . Ebony was a heavy wood indeed . He ran his hand down the smooth surface , looked at the tip  --  which seemed to be made of steel ? and then at the head . Silver , inscribed A. LINCOLN , PRES . U.S.A. and 1863 . Above that was the name of the pueblo . He ran his thumbnail under the L and examined the nail . What it had scraped away looked a little like wax but it was probably something more professional than that . Probably some sort of molding putty sold in art supply houses for just this purpose . Penitewa was watching him . " Are you checking whether I 'm a neat housekeeper ? " " No sir , " Leaphorn said . He got up and showed Penitewa first the head of the cane and then the residue on his thumbnail . " I think someone stuck the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they made an impression of it to make the copy . Could that be possible ? " Penitewa looked surprised . " Who could it have been ? " He sat again , put the cane on the table in front of him . " Lot of people , I guess . " It 's always left on the wall like that ? " Leaphorn said . " Or do you lock it up somewhere ? "  | " It 's the governor 's symbol , " Penitewa said . " Whoever is governor , it hangs on the wall in his office . It 's the tradition . When I was a little boy , my great-grandfather was governor . It hung on the wall in his house . " Leaphorn wanted to ask if anyone had ever stolen it , which would have been a stupid question since there it was , in the governor 's hand . But Penitewa seemed to sense the thought . " I think President Lincoln sent nineteen of them out from Washington  --  one for each of the pueblos . The Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavier cane . " Some of the pueblos got another one  --  three canes altogether  --  one from the Mexican government when Mexico won its independence . And a couple of pueblos , so I 'm told , do n't have any anymore . " " Stolen ? " Penitewa shrugged . " Disappeared , " he said . " Who knows what happened to them . But nobody has ever tried to steal ours . " " If someone made a molding of the head of this one , it probably happened fairly recently . Have you had any unusual visitors this month ? Anyone you left alone in here long enough for that to be done ? Anyone suspicious ? " Penitewa considered , shook his head . " How about Delmar Kanitewa ? We think he brought the replica from Thoreau to his uncle . " " Delmar , " Penitewa said . He thought . " No . He 's been away living with his dad . " " How about Francis Sayesva ? " If the governor had needed to think about that , it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Francis was my friend . " " I heard that , " Leaphorn said . " But I was told you disagreed about a lot of things . Where to put the grade school when it was built . Whether the pueblo should lease the old Jacks Wild Mine for a dump . Where to locate the new housing when the Bureau of Indian Affairs wanted it built . Things like that . " Penitewa laughed . " Francis loved to argue , " he said . " Somebody would want to do something , Francis was always the one to tell the council why not . Somebody wanted to stop something , Francis was there saying why to do it . But he was a good man . He was one of the valuable people . " " You do n't think he had the copy made ? " " No . Not Francis . " " Teddy Sayesva said that Francis told Henry Agoyo to put the Lincoln Cane in the wagon . Teddy said this would be a terrible insult to you and that Agoyo did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did you know that ? " " Of course I knew it . One of my nephews was the other clown helping with the wagon . " The governor smiled . " Tano is a small place , Lieutenant . Not many interesting things happen . Everybody was talking about that cane . " " Was it an insult ? You said Francis was your friend . Why did he do it ? " The governor smiled again . " If you had known Francis you would know the answer . He must have thought I was going to sell the cane . That would be terrible . So he was willing to do whatever he could do to stop it . Even if  | it was against an old friend . He was what you call ' an honorable man . ' " Leaphorn considered this . It demanded another question that was hard to ask . He cleared his throat . " I am a stranger to Tano culture , " he said , " but it would seem to me that if Francis was your old friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that way in public if he did n't think it was true . Do you really believe he thought you were going to sell the Lincoln Cane ? " " He must have believed it , " he said . " That bothered me , too . It still does . I do n't think he would have done it if he did n't believe I was about to betray the people . " Another hard question . " What would have caused him to think that ? " " I do n't know , " Penitewa said . " I am trying to find out . " He looked at Leaphorn . " It hurts when you think an old friend like Francis died thinking you were a traitor . "  | THE NAVAJO Agricultural Industries project tended to affect Jim Chee in different ways  --  depending on his mood . If he drove past it in a " patriotic Navajo mood " it filled him with both pride and regrets . He was proud of what the tribe had done with its water rights from the San Juan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regrets focused on what might have been had not the whites wrested all the good rich bottom land away from the tribe . On the north side of Highway 44 , the ocean of sagebrush stretched away into the Angel Peak badlands . On the south side of the highway where the NAI held  | domain , the black-gray-silver of the sage had been replaced by mile after mile of green , the shade depending on the crop and the season . Dense stands of cornstalks alternated with thousands of acres of potato fields , followed by great circles of kelly green alfalfa , and incredible expanses of onions , watermelons , cantaloupes , cucumbers , sugar beets , whatever crop the market demanded . And all of this had been made possible by a rare and seemingly small Navajo victory over white land-grabbers . Chee had found an account of it in the depths of the Zimmerman Library while a student at the University of New Mexico and had read it happily . Way back in Civil War times , and maybe before , the Navajos had built a header @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrigate their cornfields . Whites had already driven the Navajos off most of their rich bottom-land farms along the river and seized it for themselves . They moved in on this irrigated land as well , even though it was part of what had by then been declared Navajo Reservation . But when the Navajos prepared to fight for their homes , the U.S. Army moved in and  --  for the first and only time  --  sided with the tribe and made the squatters move out . The old Cornfield Ditch was expanded into the Fruitland Canal in the 1930s , irrigating almost 1,500 acres . More important , it maintained Navajo legal rights to the river water . While the whites had taken nearly all the good bottom land , the Navajos still owned the water and an infinity of worthless high desert hills . Now , from planting season until harvest , that water was showered out over the desert through elaborate mobile sprinkler systems . It  | turned the hills lush and green and produced jobs for hundreds of Navajos . When Jim Chee was feeling patriotic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were using their water and not letting it drain down into the Colorado to produce golf courses in Las Vegas and fill the hot tubs of Beverly Hills . Today , however , he was feeling religious . When he felt that way , the NAI bothered him . He had stopped at the NAI administrative offices and gotten directions from a puzzled clerk , who obviously wondered about this policeman 's interest in the processing of the onion crop . He turned off Highway 44 southward on the road to the warehouse complex where marketing and shipping were handled . He looked out at the stubble fields of autumn , at millions of dollars ' worth of mobile irrigation pipes parked for the winter and already being buried under the tumbleweeds blowing in from the desert ; at the power lines that made it all work , and beyond this to the hills sloping southwards toward the Bisti Badlands and the De-Na-Zin Wilderness . The hills were still black and silver with sage  --  as nature had made them before the NAI bulldozers had ripped away plant life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birds that fed upon them . He saw the hills as the great spirit Changing Woman must have seen them , She who had taught that the earth was our nurturing mother and that earth , and all she produced , must be treated with respect . Was this business of reducing nature to great irrigated circles becoming the Beauty Way of the Navajos ? This and the immense scar of the  | Navajo Mine , and the sawmill operations in the Chuska Mountains , and What was wrong with him ? Why this lousy mood ? He knew why . Her name was Janet . But what was her clan ? And what the hell was he going to do about it ? He did n't know that . He could n't decide what he would do until he knew for certain that he had to decide . First he was going to catch this hit-and-run son-of-a-bitch and then he was going to drive back to Frank Sam Nakai 's place and find out what his uncle had learned . And if his uncle had learned nothing yet  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to know  --  then he would take Hosteen Nakai to find the old man . Or if his uncle would n't go , he would go himself . He did n't want to wait . But it is a policeman 's fate to wait . The working day had not yet ended at the produce warehouses . He cruised slowly through the gravel parking lot , looking for a dark green pickup truck with an ERNIE IS THE GREATEST bumper sticker . There were seven greens among the ranks of trucks and cars , three of them about the right vintage to match the description . If any of them had ever worn the bumper sticker , they were n't wearing it now . Chee parked his own pickup where it was partly concealed by an old Chevy conversion van , then glanced at his watch . Seven minutes until five , when the warehouse closed . He sat , not thinking of Janet Pete . He switched on the radio , still tuned to KNDN . A group Chee remembered hearing at a Tuba City Girl Dance was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but loving them or not , had still stolen their Chevy Blazer . All was in Navajo except the truck 's trade name .  | The reader of the commercial that followed had a similar problem  --  there are no Navajo nouns for Purina Pig Chow . A door at the side of the warehouse slid open . A man emerged wearing coveralls , followed by a procession of other men . Still more men emerged from around the building , with a scattering of women . Chee scanned them , studying them without knowing what he was looking for . A medium-sized , middle-aged , Navajo male . That narrowed it a little . It left out the women , and the very tall , and the very round , and the young bucks whom Ellie would definitely have been able to describe in more detail . Eight or ten fit the medium-middle cate-gory  --  probably more . One of them was standing beside the warehouse door , holding a clipboard , discussing something with two younger workers . Another was walking almost directly toward Chee . He gave Chee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engine . Chee looked back at the man with the clipboard . Probably a foreman . He was wearing jeans and a jean jacket and a long-billed cap . The bill seemed to be bent sharply upward as if the cardboard stiffener in it had been broken . " Aah , " Chee said . He leaned forward . Staring . Too far away . He started the pickup engine and eased it forward into the stream of vehicles leaving the lot , then turned out of the traffic flow to coast past the door . The man was still talking to the two , his back turned . Chee drove past the doorway , circled , and parked again where he could watch Clipboard . The man was still talking , his cap still met the description . But a bent-billed cap is  | scanty proof . The truck would be crucial to any chance of getting a conviction . Where had the man parked it ? At the warehouse door , the conversation ended . Clipboard disappeared inside . The two young men split . One disappeared around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chee . He was grinning . Chee got out of his pickup , glad he was n't wearing his uniform . " That guy you were talking to , " he said . " With the clipboard . Was that Billy Tsossie ? " " You mean the foreman ? " He looked back toward the warehouse door , now closing . " No . His name 's Hoski . Clement Hoski . " " Clement Hoski , " Chee said . " Yeah , I thought he looked familiar . I need to talk to him . You know where he parks his truck ? " " I think he 's in a carpool , " the man said . " He comes in with a bunch who live out in NAI housing . " Clement Hoski emerged from the warehouse , shut the door behind him , and trotted to a white Dodge Caravan . He climbed into the back and it pulled away , spraying gravel . " Thanks , " Chee said . " I 'll try to catch him . " The Caravan delivered the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built for NAI on the hillside north of the marketing center . It pulled back onto the asphalt road . Chee gave it almost a quartermile start . The empty road made undetected following difficult but it also made losing someone almost impossible . About three miles later the van pulled off on the shoulder . Chee slowed . Hoski emerged , waved at the  | departing van , and walked up the hill where , Chee guessed , his house must be located . Right . As Chee drove past , Hoski was walking up a dirt road toward a plank house with a pitched tin roof . An outhouse stood some fifty yards down the hill , proclaiming that unlike the NAI houses this one lacked plumbing . A pole supporting a power line behind the house declared that it did have electricity . A pile of firewood against the wall suggested that it was n't served by a gas line . But where was the green pickup ? Hoski was out of sight now . In the house , Chee guessed . He continued past Hoski 's access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turned the pickup around , and got his binoculars out of the glove box . From here he had a better view across the fold of the hill . A basketball backboard and net had been mounted on the electric pole  --  suggesting that Hoski had school-age children . He seemed old for that . Maybe someone lived with him . A single-wide mobile home sat on blocks behind the house . It was windowless and empty as far as Chee could tell through the binoculars . The green truck might be parked between that and the house . If it was , there would be no way to see it short of driving in there and looking . Why wait ? Chee started the engine and drove down the hill . But at the access road he parked again . Where was the truck ? If he alerted Hoski and the truck was n't there , he would never find it . The truck was the key . When a fender hits a human hard enough to kill , there 's always evidence . If he picked up Hoski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if Hoski had any sense , he  | would then make sure that the truck would never be found . Chee thought about it . A yellow van pulled up across the highway from him . It was small for a school bus but the legend on its side read BLOOMFIELD SCHOOL DISTRICT . A boy climbed out . He was about fourteen , Chee guessed , a tall , skinny boy wearing a black jacket and blue pants and carrying a blue backpack . He walked across the asphalt toward Chee 's truck , smiling . " Hello , " he said . " Hello , mister . " " Hello , " Chee said . What would he tell the boy he was doing , parked here ? He 'd say he was looking for someone . " Is this your truck ? " the boy asked , still smiling . " It 's pretty . " The boy 's eyes were a little too far apart , the bone structure of his face just a little wrong . The smile a little too innocent for fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids with damaged brains , or bodies , or emotions , or sometimes all of those . And Chee recognized this boy 's problem . He had seen this physical evidence before . Seen it too often . They called it fetal alcohol syn-drome  --  the doom the mother imposes on her child when she drinks while pregnant . It was another of the reasons Chee hated alcohol , hated the people who made it , and advertised it , and sold it , and poisoned his people with it . " It 's my truck , " Chee said . " But it looks prettier when I get all the mud washed off it . " " I think it 's pretty now . " " I think maybe I 'll get it painted . Would green be a good color ? "  | " Sure , " the boy said , his smile unwavering . " Green 's good . " Chee was aware that he was not feeling good about this . But he said , " Do you know anybody who owns a pickup that 's green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is green . " " Where does your grandfather live ? " The boy pointed over the hood , at the house of Clement Hoski . " Have you come to see your grandfather ? " " I live there , " he said . " Me and Grandfather Hoski , we live there . " The boy laughed , a sound full of absolute delight . " Sometimes he lets me do the cooking . I cook eggs in the morning . And I make oatmeal . And I make tortillas . And Grandfather Hoski is going to show me how to make a pumpkin pie , and mutton stew . And how to roast pinon nuts . " " Your mother and dad ? They live there , too ? " The boy looked puzzled . " They 're gone , " he said . " It 's just me and Grandfather . He 's my friend . He goes to work and I go to school and then when we get home he teaches me how to read , and about numbers , and then we play games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week we do things together . We hunt rabbits and sometimes we go look at things . " " In his green pickup truck ? " The boy laughed , utterly delighted . " It 's green . He lets me drive it . When we are way out on the dirt roads . He says I 'm going to be a great driver . " " I 'll bet you will be , " Chee said . He took a deep breath . " Where does he keep it ? "  | The boy looked at Chee , puzzled . " The truck . Where does he keep the truck ? " " Up there behind the house . It 's there between our house and the old empty place where we keep things . You want to go see it ? I 'll show you . It 's pretty . " " Your name 's Ernie , is n't it ? " " Ernie , " he agreed , nodding . " Grandfather had my name printed and put it on the back of our truck . You want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chee said . " I want to think about it . "  | JOE LEAPHORN had n't had much sleep . He had stayed up late  --  sitting in what they had called their guest bedroom in the days when Emma had been alive and they had entertained guests . Now it had become , slowly and with no real planning , Leaphorn 's office away from his office . The guest bed had become the flat surface on which things that needed to be spread could be spread . On it , Leaphorn had arranged airline timetables , railroad timetables , maps of China , maps of Mongolia , an assortment of the odds and ends one needs to plan a trip when you 're half-afraid of taking it . Contrary to Leap-horn 's nature , this business had become rushed and hur-  | ried  --  last-minute planning . In just two days he would meet Louisa at the Flagstaff airport . They would fly down to Phoenix , thence to Los Angeles , and from there it would be off to another world  --  to Peking . Beijing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made reservations for them at the Tianlun Dynasty for the three days they would be there . " They 're so expen-sive , " Louisa had said . " I thought we could share a room . " And into the silence she had added , " It has two beds in it . " These three days were to allow him time to work his way through any bureaucratic snarls that going north into Mongolia might entail , and to allow her the time she needed in the Beijing libraries , and to meet with the folklorists with whom she had been working . " And to allow us a little time just to be tourists . " She had reached over and squeezed his hand as she said it , looking intensely happy . As happy as a child . He had been touched , and was touched now , remembering it . " You 've got to see Mao 's Tomb , the old Summer Palace , and the Friendship Store . The world 's wildest variety store . " He looked at the map again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where Louisa had written to a linguist and other scholars and made reservations for him , and she would head south to Xian , and Nanjing , and more meetings with her fellow citizens in the small world of folklorists . Then they would meet again in Shanghai for the trip home together . He had spent almost two hours reading through the guidebooks she had loaned him , working out the best schedule he could  --  disgruntled because it had to be based mostly on guesswork . And then he had started  | packing . " Layers , " she had advised him . " That 's the secret in China . It seems like it 's always cold outside and too hot inside . So take sweaters , and long johns , and some stuff you can peel off . And do n't take too much because it 's easy to get stuff washed . And you are the right size . You can buy Chinese clothing . " She had studied him , smiling . " In fact , I think you could pass for Chinese . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had pushed the maps aside to make room for his suitcase , folding in shorts , and undershirts , and socks , and in the process uncovering his pajamas . Emma had bought them for him . She had bought him his first set for his birthday two weeks after their marriage , looking at him shyly as he opened the package , wondering how he would take this hint . He had worn pajamas for years in deference to Emma 's modesty , and gradually had become used to them , and to receiving a gift-wrapped new pair whenever a present was appropriate and the previous pair had worn thin . But Emma had died . There had been no more new pajamas then . No more wearing the old ones . Putting them on had provoked far too many memories . He had picked them out of the drawer , inspected them , and found them in fair condition . A little tight around the stomach , as he remembered , but he had lost a little weight eating his own cooking . One room with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been overpowered by the desolation of this empty , silent house , and the knowledge of loss and loneliness . He had gone out into the darkness , and walked up the gravel street . When he became aware that his feet were hurt-  | ing , he sat on a boulder where he could watch the last half of the moon rising over the ridge east of Window Rock , and the occasional car rolling down the highway toward Fort Defiance . Finally , when even the highway was silent and the moon was high and the cold had seeped up his pant legs and down the back of his jacket , he got up and walked stiffly home . In his real office now he felt the lack of sleep . He glanced at his in-basket . It had collected a stack of notes and mail in the days he 'd spent working at Thoreau and Tano . But that stack could wait . So could everything else except the Eric Dorsey homicide . He had just a day left to work on that before he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's number . He 'd talk to Chee about what he 'd learned at Tano . If nothing else , it would help him judge Chee 's intelligence . The memo Chee had left him showed good instincts . He 'd sensed that the people at Tano had seen something Chee had missed . Maybe the boy would come up with something from the Lincoln Cane business . But Chee did n't answer his telephone . Leaphorn buzzed Virginia . " Just a minute , " she said . " I think there 's a note in the overnight file . " The minute passed . " He called in . He said he 's been working on that Todachene vehicular homicide case . He said he has to take the rest of the week off . He 's going to charge it to his annual leave time . " Virginia 's tone had become disapproving . " I did n't see any paperwork on that , " she said . " Did you put through the paperwork ? " " Did he leave a number where I can reach him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that here , " she said . " You want me to call the Shiprock office ? " " Please , " Leaphorn said . " And let me know . " It would n't do any good , but it would get Virginia off his telephone . He hung up , feeling sleepy and disgruntled . This **26;36;TOOLONG business exactly fit Chee 's reputation . When the kid had worked out of Tuba City , Captain Largo used to complain about the trouble he had getting Chee to follow regulations . At Crownpoint it had been the same story . There his brains had gotten him acting sergeant stripes when he was still green , and his habit of doing his own thing had gotten him busted just as fast . Ah , well , Leaphorn thought , it was worth the gamble . In this office it did n't matter so much . Less routine and more innovative thinking required . Maybe he could get Chee saddle-broken just a little bit , just enough to keep him . But where the hell could he be ? Could Chee still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it . Maybe Chee had found a customer and was off doing a curing ceremonial someplace . If he was still doing the Blessing Way  --  the full eight days of the ceremonial  --  that could become a real problem . His telephone buzzed . " Leaphorn , " he said . It was Virginia . " The chief wants to talk to you . Line two . " He punched two . " Yes sir , " he said . And then he listened , placid at first , then frowning .  | " Yeah , " he said . " Yes sir . I did n't actually hear it but I read about it . I was over at Flagstaff . There was a piece about it in the Arizona Republic . Hell of a funny ... " He stopped , interrupted . The frown converted into conster-nation . " In the tape player on my radio ? " He looked at the radio . The tape player was empty . " Let me get this straight , " Leaphorn said . " Sergeant Yazzie was walking by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . And that was before it was broadcast by KNDN ? Is that what you 're telling me ? " Leaphorn listened . " Be damned if I know , " he said . " There 's no tape in there now . Did somebody come in here and take it ? " Listened again , the frown resolving itself into a stolid anger . " All right , " he said . " I 'll be right down . " He trotted down the stairs . The chief 's door was open . Bennie Redhair , who served as the chief 's secretary and gofer , was sitting behind his desk looking very , very nervous . His smile at Leaphorn came out more like a grimace . Beyond him in the inner office was Councilman Jimmy Chester , wearing a black hat with a silver band , sitting across the desk from the chief . Councilman Chester glowered at Leaphorn . The chief 's expression , as he motioned Leaphorn in , was a mixture of worry and puzzlement . " Close the door behind you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out it was almost thirty minutes later . He climbed the stairs slowly and eased himself into his swivel chair  --  staring at the radio . How could this  | have happened ? The specifics were obvious  --  to him if not to Councilman Chester and the chief . Someone had come in , put a tape of that telephone wiretap in his radio tape player , and turned it on . And left it turned on for a while , apparently , because Yazzie 's report said he had heard parts of it at least twice . Once walking down the hall , and once on his return trip . Then , after the notorious broadcast over KNDN up in Kirtland had stirred up an uproar , Yazzie remembered what he had heard . He 'd reported it . A check was made and the tape was found , still in Leaphorn 's radio . The question , of course , was who , and why . Leaphorn had n't the faintest idea of how to answer either question . The councilman had no such problem . He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why was to destroy the councilman 's reputation . Just why would Leaphorn want to do that ? Because the councilman , as chairman of the Justice Committee , had opposed the idea of setting up Leaphorn 's separate Special Investigations Office . And because he suspected Leaphorn was one of the tree huggers fighting the waste dump proposal . And because way back years ago one of Leaphorn 's maternal uncles had lost a grazing-rights dispute with the councilman over in the Checkerboard Reservation . And what was to be done about this misconduct ? The councilman wanted Leaphorn charged with illegally tapping his telephone , a third-degree felony . He wanted Leaphorn dismissed from the Navajo Tribal Police for using his office to interfere in the politics of the Navajo Nation . It ended , as such affairs always seem to end , with an  | unhappy compromise . The chief would assign Captain Dodge to handle an investigation  --  to determine exactly what had happened and to collect the evidence needed to prosecute the guilty party . " Investigation , " Councilman Chester had snorted . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for a moment , with Leaphorn thinking that Chester , having presided over many of them himself in thirty years on the council , should know . And so it was decided that Captain Dodge would be given ten days to wrap it up and report . " And how about him ? " the councilman had asked , nodding toward Leaphorn . The lieutenant , said the chief , would be ordered to cooperate fully with the investigators , to make himself available at all times , to provide all relevant information . " Come on , " Councilman Chester had said . " Give me a break . He 's one of the top brass around here . What kind of cooperation is Dodge going to get in this department with him looking over everybody 's shoulders ? " " Lieutenant Leaphorn will be off duty until this investigation is completed , " the chief said . And with that Councilman Jimmy Chester left , slamming the door behind him . " That mean I 'm suspended ? " Leaphorn asked . And , of course , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of what this suspension would mean . For one thing , all of this meant he could n't follow his instinct to cross-examine everyone in the building . Surely someone would have seen somebody come up  | here and get into his office . And if they had n't , that too would tell him something . But he could n't do that now . Captain Dodge would be doing it . Leaphorn wished someone a little brighter had been picked . Why Dodge ? He was always reliable . And come to think of it , he was also one of the Towering House Clan . And so was Councilman Chester . Which explained why Chester had seemed moderately satisfied with the deal , and why the chief had picked Dodge . Where the hell was Chee when he needed him ? Leaphorn got up and peered absentmindedly out into the parking lot . No sign of Chee 's always muddy pickup truck . What if Chee had done it ? Leaphorn considered that . Chester had labeled Leaphorn a tree hugger , but it was Chee who wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wanted this office to go on a corruption hunt . Chee was always in and out of his office , but so were Dodge , and Virginia , and Yazzie , and just about everybody else . Chee had the opportunity . How about motive ? Leaphorn considered that . The young man resented him , that was plain , but Chee also respected him . Liked him , too . And he was way too damned smart to do an illegal wiretap and then be so careless with it . It would n't be Chee . How about Yazzie ? Nope . Yazzie was a friend , sort of a protege , and a member of Emma 's clan . Dodge ? Maybe . But only if Councilman Chester had somehow engaged Dodge in some sort of weird conspiracy to discredit Leaphorn . He could think of no possible scenario for that . And so he dropped it and did what he had been dreading to do . He picked up the telephone , got an out-  | side line , gave the operator his AT &T; calling card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand why he could n't go , but she would be disappointed . " I like to travel , " she had told him . " But it can really remind you of your loneliness . When you 're tired , and you 're having trouble with the language , and you 've gone all day with not a soul to talk to , then it really hits you . " The telephone in Louisa 's faculty office rang , and rang , and rang . No classes this morning , he remembered . She would be at home . He dialed again , thinking how he would put it . He would want her to know he simply had to cancel until this was over . With even a hint of a criminal investigation aimed at him , he could n't leave , and he certainly could n't leave the country . But he would n't want her to worry . He 'd already done too much to take the fun out of this trip for her . On the fourth ring , her answering machine kicked in  --  her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone . Well , maybe it was better this way . " Louisa , " he said . " This is Joe . Bad news . I 'm sort of suspected of being involved in that Councilman Jimmy Chester telephone tapping thing . The one in the paper where it sounded like Chester was soliciting a bribe . I 'm under orders to stay here until it 's cleared up . If it can be cleared up fast I could still make it , but that 's about one chance in a million . So if it does n't drag on too long , I 'll try to catch a later flight and join you in Beijing . " But there was no real chance of that , and she would know it . He paused , searching for something to say , knowing that he would n't be taking a later flight . Things did n't  | work out that way with him . " Louisa . I feel terrible about this . I 'm really going to miss you . " He paused again . To his surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than that . He might say I think I love you , or maybe even I love you . But then the answering machine clicked off .  | LEAPHORN HUNG UP the telephone and looked at his watch , unusually conscious of time . He might be finished with the Navajo Tribal Police . If the person who had set him up had planned it carefully , Leaphorn might never really be cleared of doubts . In that event he would resign , and if he did , he wanted no loose ends left behind him . He had a possible hook now on the Eric Dorsey homicide . At least he thought he did . He wanted to know . For Captain Dodge , he typed one of the detailed memos for which he was noted . In three precise , singlespaced pages he provided a chronology covering every  | step that might apply , answering every question he thought Dodge would be asking , suggesting people Dodge might want to contact . Finished , he read it through carefully , thought a moment , and stuck the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this office , of course , until this matter is resolved , but I will check in with you periodically in the event I am needed . He signed it , stuck the sheets into an envelope , dropped his office key into it , sealed it , and addressed it to Captain Dodge . On his way out , he handed it to Vir-ginia . Virginia looked uncharacteristically solemn . She glanced at the envelope , and up at Leaphorn , raising her eyebrows in an unspoken question . " I 'm going to tell you something , " he said . " And then I am going to ask you for a favor . " " Something bad has happened , has n't it , " she said . " Bad enough , " Leaphorn said . " By tomorrow morning , the word is going to get out that I 've been suspended . What I want ? " Virginia 's expression stopped him . It went from shock , to sorrow , to anger , and the intensity of it surprised him . Virginia is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't he appreciated that before ? Why was he so blind about such important things ? " Suspended , " she said . " It has to do with that Councilman Chester telephone call . The one that was broadcast . "  | " That son-of-a-bitch , " she said . " I thought it would be him . " " We 'll get it worked out , " Leaphorn said . " But until we do I could use your help . " " Anything , " Virginia said . " About tomorrow , I 'd guess , you 're going to be hearing rumors about this . Captain Dodge is going to have to be asking around , questioning people , so it wo n't be hard to figure out that an investigation is going on and that I 'm the target of it . Word will be leaking out . What would help me a lot would be if you could sort of slow it down . When people call to ask , could you laugh it off ' ? Could you maybe make them think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em it 's a damned lie , " Virginia said . " I 'll tell ' em nobody would be that crazy . Not even this bunch . " She held her hand out to him . It took him a second to understand the gesture , then he took it , and felt his hand being squeezed . " What about the trip ? " she said . " To China . You were going tomorrow . " Leaphorn shrugged . " Those bastards , " she said . " Do n't they have any sense ? " He patted her on the shoulder . " Ah , come on , Virginia . The chief 's just doing his job . " Leaphorn called the Crownpoint office from home . Lieutenant Toddy had left for home but the dispatcher said he would get the message to him .  | " It 's Meet Lieutenant Leaphorn at Saint Bonaventure Mission at ten tomorrow morning ' ? Is that right ? And bring the key to Dorsey 's office and his Dorsey file . " " Right , " Leaphorn said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answering machine , and could think of nothing to add to what he 'd already told it . He sat in the gathering darkness with no motivation to switch on the light , or the television , or to begin unpacking his bags . He thought about the tape and how it might have come to be . Roger Applebee , the lobbyist for Nature First , was the only one he could think of whose cause would be helped . He called the Navajo Nation Inn . Yes , Roger Applebee was registered . He was in room 127 . No , Roger Applebee did n't answer his telephone . Leaphorn picked up his car keys and walked out to the driveway . He 'd go to the Navajo Inn for a hamburger or something . Maybe Applebee would be having dinner . Most of the parking spaces along the two-story wing that held room 127 were empty , but at Applebee 's door a dark blue Range Rover was parked . Leaphorn stopped his car behind it . A decal on the back displayed a picture of earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , IT 'S THE ONLY HOME WE HAVE . Probably Applebee 's car . Leaphorn moved his car forward , planning to park and knock at the door . Then he saw a man  --  a big man who looked vaguely familiar  --  turn the corner and come hurrying down the . walk toward him . Leaphorn let his car roll , parked it a half-dozen spaces down . The big man stopped at 127 and tried the knob . Then he knocked , knocked again , rattled the knob ,  | turned to inspect the Range Rover briefly , and then pounded on the door . Leaphorn joined him . " I 'm looking for Mr. Applebee , " Leaphorn said . " Seems like he 's not home . " The big man looked at Leaphorn , glanced back at the Range Rover . " That 's his car , " he said . " He ca n't be far away . " " Maybe in the dining room , " Leaphorn said . He recognized the man now , but the name eluded him . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient , odd , or beautiful . One of those who show up at tribal fairs , rug auctions , ceremonials , even postfuneral family gatherings looking for the sort of things for which collectors are willing to pay big money and for which they will offer very little money . With that thought came recognition . This was Asher Davis , one of the exceptions . Mister Fair Price . The first time he 'd heard the name was at a coffee shop in Tuba City , at least twenty years ago . Captain Largo , young and thin then and a sergeant , telling an old woman not to sell her grandfather 's concha belt until she could ask Asher Davis what it was worth . " I checked the dining room , " Davis said . He banged on the door again , half-heartedly this time . It was less a summons than an expression of frustrated anger  --  a gesture devoid of hope . " He 's out here lobbying the Tribal Council about something , " Davis said . " Maybe he 's off somewhere with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | Davis really looked at Leaphorn for the first time , taking in polished boots , pressed jeans , silver belt buckle , blue shirt , denim jacket , gray felt hat . " Friend ? " he said , and shook his head . " Unfortunately , yes . Old friends . " The tone was sarcastic . Davis made a wry face . " Ever since grade school . " Suddenly , his face lit with recognition . " Hey . Did n't you used to be with the Navajo police ? Years ago ? Is your name Leaphorn ? " " Joe Leaphorn , " Leaphorn said . " And you 're Asher Davis . " " Right , " Davis said . " You remember the first time our trails crossed ? " Leaphorn did n't . Probably at the Navajo Nation Fair at Window Rock , or the Crownpoint Rug Auction . In fact , he now remembered chatting with Davis at the auction years ago . " Crownpoint Rug Auction , " he said . " Long before that , " Davis said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navajo police . At Chinle . And I got in this crazy mess ? " He gestured toward the door of 127 . " Applebee again . He and I were in Farmington on some business or other , and he 'd let his credit card expire so I let him use mine to rent a car there . He 'd flown in on Mesa Airlines and he had to go to Canyon de Chelly to meet some people . Make a long story short , next thing I knew he 's sent me the keys from San Francisco with a little sketch showing where the car 's parked there at the canyon . " Leaphorn 's memory produced the incident  --  a hard one to forget . " Yeah , " he said . " You called the station to see if we  | could find you someone who could drive it back to Avis at Farmington . " " Before I went broke paying the overdue rental fees , " Davis said . " I owe you a favor for that . " As it had happened , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Farmington , so it had n't been a problem . He had met Davis in person the next year at the rug weavers ' cooperative auction at Crownpoint , and Davis 's thanks had been embarrassingly effusive . But now Leaphorn did need a favor . " I really need to talk to this Applebee guy , " Leaphorn said . " You have any idea where I could find him ? " Davis frowned . " I know he 's here to lobby against that waste dump thing , but I do n't know who he 'd be working on this evening . No idea . " " I always wondered how you got stuck in that rental car situation . What happened ? " " Well , " Davis said , and looked past Leaphorn out across the parking lot . He shook his head . " That was a long time ago . Roger was getting his Nature First thing off the ground and he found out these big environmentalists from Frisco were coming out to see some Indian Country . Things were going well and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he rode down to Flagstaff with ' em and went on back to California so they could introduce him to some other rich folks . " " I meant , What happened next ? Did you break his arm or what ? " Leaphorn thought then that perhaps Davis 's reputation as an honest Indian trader was due to his face . It  | was an honest face , not practiced at stealth or secrecy . Now it showed a flash of anger , which faded into bitterness , which faded into something like sorrow . " Old friends , " he said . He thought about that a moment , shook his head , and produced a sardonic chuckle . " He 's done worse to me . " Leaphorn extracted his card from his billfold and handed it to Davis . " If you find him before I do , would you ask him to contact me ? At the home number . " Davis glanced at the card , and back at Leaphorn , and back at the card . When he looked up again his honest face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , banged on the door of 127 again , and walked away . Leaphorn arrived at Saint Bonaventure School a little early and found Lieutenant Toddy waiting . He was sitting on the little foldout doorstep of the dilapidated little trailer that had been Dorsey 's home and office  --  drinking a Pepsi and looking bored . He broke the seal that secured the door , unlocked it , and held it open for Leaphorn . " You know Streib already searched this place , " Toddy said . " I do n't think he found anything interesting . " " He did n't know what to look for , " Leaphorn said . Toddy suppressed a grin and restored his expression to almost neutral . " That 's supposed to be better , is n't it ? Did n't I hear somebody saying that just a little while back ? If you know what you 're looking for , then you look for something specific and you do n't see something that might be more important . ' Somebody was saying that . "  | " Well , " Leaphorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this time we 're a little wiser . We know that Dorsey made an ebony cane with a silver knob  --  a copy of the antique cane the governor keeps at Tano Pueblo . Let 's forget that stuff somebody told you and look for anything that would tell us who he made that cane for . " " Or the cane itself ? " " That 'd be nice . But apparently the Kanitewa boy got his hands on it and took it to Tano and gave it to his uncle , " Leaphorn said . He was looking around the tiny room , barely high enough to stand in and not much longer than the foldout cot against the opposite wall . Everything was tidy , everything neat , nothing relaxed , nothing comfortable . A tiny table , a single chair , the cot with a filing cabinet at its foot , a small desk . On the wall , a framed family photograph  --  mother , father , three boys , and a girl . Beside it , another framed photo of a bearded young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall a bit , a picture of St. Francis of Assisi . Leaphorn paused to read the poem under it . He had conversations with the crows , This brother to the moon All he asked of his Lord Was to be God 's fool . " This should n't take long , " Toddy said , " searching this place . " It did n't . Leaphorn started at the desk , which he guessed Dorsey must have made himself . It was fitted carefully in the area between the entrance and the slid-  | ing door which opened into a space that held a shower , a toilet stool , and a wash basin . Four wooden desk-organizer boxes stood in an exact line on the desk top , labeled UNFINISHED BUSINESS , GRADED , UNGRADED and TO BE FILED . The " graded " and " ungraded " boxes were empty but the other two held neat stacks of papers . If anything relating to the cane was here at all ( and suddenly that seemed unlikely ) , it should be in the " unfinished business " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny room never to return , the business of the cane was in fact unfinished . But if there was nothing there , Leaphorn would sort through the gray metal three-drawer filing cabinet that occupied the space at the foot of the narrow bed . He would search everywhere . It was the only lead he had , the only chance . He found what he wanted right on top of the stack in the " unfinished business " box , as if Dorsey might have dropped it there just before he left for his shop . Streib must have looked at it , but then it would have meant absolutely nothing . It was a sheet of poor-quality typing paper . On one side a poster advertising a meeting had been printed . On the other someone had neatly penciled in sketches of the Lincoln Cane and had scribbled a scattering of explanatory notes on dimensions and tapering and a line of jottings on the margin . " I think this is what we 're looking for , " he told Toddy , displaying the sheet . He sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the sort Leaphorn had himself once made in woodworking shop long ago when he was a  | student in a Bureau of Indian Affairs boarding school . Little lines marked margins , and numbers between arrows marked dimensions in inches . One sketch was of the cane itself . The other was of the head , with the details of the legend carefully drawn in : A. LINCOLN , PRES. u.S.A. , 1863 , and TANO . Across the page was written " Misc . File . " Notes , in tidy handwriting that Leaphorn presumed was Dorsey 's , ran down the right margin of the paper : ebony  --  get dark as possible tip  --  cast iron . neat fit . try farrier at Farmington. grind . head  --  buff . avoid dust . $450 , $250 advance . delivery on/before Nov. 14 . November fourteenth . The day Eric Dorsey died . Leaphorn handed the paper to Toddy . " It looks like Dorsey got cheated out of his last two hundred , " he said . There was nothing else related to the cane in either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealt mostly with classwork , warranties on power tools , operating instructions , and orders for supplies . Leaphorn checked through those , sorting out invoices from Albuquerque Specialty Woods . An invoice on a September 13 shipment listed " One ebony , 2 x 2 x 36 . " He showed it to Toddy . " Here 's when he bought the wood , " Leaphorn said . Toddy grunted . There were other Specialty Woods invoices in the  | file . Leaphorn checked through them , backward in time , in his advertised mode of just looking without knowing for what . " Be damned , " he said . " Look at this . " " Well , now , " Toddy said . " It looks like Mr. Dorsey was in the cane-making business . " The form principally covered an order of walnut , mahogany , and clear white pine . But the last item read , " No. 1 ebony blank 2 x 2 x 36 . " Leaphorn looked at the date . The shipment had been made more than two years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Leaphorn found the " Misc . File " folder in the back of the bottom drawer . In it was a thick packet of letters secured with a rubber band , copies of correspondence about an overdue VISA card payment , notes that seemed to deal with Christmas presents , and assorted sheets of paper bearing notes . One bore a neat pencil sketch of a Lincoln Cane . Leaphorn extracted it . On this sheet the instructions had been typed . They gave dimensions , details of the finish of the silver head , of how the cast-iron tip should be ground . The dimensions of the letters to form the legend were specified in millimeters . And now the legend read , A. LINCOLN PRES . U.S.A. 1863 POJOAQUE . Pojoaque . Leaphorn had been there long ago . A tiny place beside the highway north of Santa Fe . Leaphorn flipped through the bundle of envelopes . Thirty-seven letters , the first of them with the same return address in Fort Worth , Texas , the rest from the Veterans Administration hospital in Amarillo , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had come about a week apart at first and then less frequently . Leaphorn returned them to their hiding place in the bottom drawer . He handed Toddy the Pojoaque Lincoln Cane sheet . " I 'd say he made two of them , " Toddy said . " And the second one he finished right on the deadline . " " Yeah , " Leaphorn said . " That was the date , was n't it ? " " It was . So now we know Dorsey not only got killed . He got screwed . " " Out of his final payment , " Leaphorn said . " That 's right . He just had twenty-something dollars in his billfold . But maybe he got paid in advance . " Toddy shrugged . " No difference , now , " he said . " You finished here ? " " I think so , " Leaphorn said . " Has Streib released this stuff so his kinfolks can claim it ? Is somebody coming after it ? " Toddy was looking at the family photograph . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The oldest boy . " He moved from the photograph to the framed motto . " Did you read this ? " " No , " Leaphorn said . " I think it 's out of the Bible . Maybe one of the psalms . " Toddy read it , in the voice one reserves for reciting poetry : " One thing I will ask of the Lord , This will I seek after : That I may dwell in the House of the Lord All the days of my life .  | " I think it 's one of the Psalms of Solomon , or maybe it was David . " " It 's a lot like some of the verses from our Blessing Way , " Leaphorn said . " You notice that ? " Toddy 's expression said he had n't . But now he did . " I see what you mean , " he said . " The House Made of Morning Mist , the House Made of Dawn . " He turned and looked at the motto . " May I always walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family coming to get his stuff ? " Leaphorn repeated . " No , " Toddy said . " Nobody seems to want it . Let 's get out of here . "  | FATHER HAINES had his coat on and his hat in his hand when Leaphorn tapped at his office door . " I just wanted to know if I could borrow a tele-phone , " Leaphorn said . He displayed his AT &T; calling card . " I need to make some long-distance calls . " " How about mine ? " Haines said . He pointed to his desk and glanced at his watch . " I have a meeting in Gallup , so just make yourself comfortable . " Comfortable it was . From its looks , Haines 's chair had been made about fifty years ago and heavily used . Its seat was well-padded leather . It swiveled , and tilted , and felt generally substantial . And the Haines telephone was  | one of those heavy black rotary-dial jobs made back when Ma Bell ruled . Leaphorn used it to dial information and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desmond Clark was in , and wanted to know how Leaphorn was doing , and when they were going to go deer hunting again , and why did n't Leaphorn retire , and how his health was holding up . Past all that old-friend exchange , they came to business . " You know all about the Lincoln Canes , I guess , " Leaphorn said . " What would one be worth to a collector , and who would buy one ? Fill me in on all that . " " That 's easy , " Clark said . " Nobody would buy one . Everybody would know it was stolen property . You could n't display it . Or brag about it . " " How about the Zuni War Gods ? " Leaphorn said . " Somebody bought them , knowing they had to have been stolen . And the Hopis have had lots of stuff disappear and then it turns up in collections . And ? " " Okay , " Clark said . " I see what you mean . The underground market . Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leaphorn said , and waited . " I believe of Honest Abe sent nineteen of those out during the Civil War . Eighteen or nineteen . So they 're extremely rare , and they 're extremely unusual , and they look great . Ebony and silver , you know . And everybody 's favorite national hero had them made with his name on them . So if you were a Lincoln man , or even a Civil War buff , one would be worth a ton . I 'd guess bidding would start at a hundred thousand . Maybe better . But a stolen one ? I do n't know . I guess dealers who know the Lincoln  | trade could find a buyer . My field is Native American collectibles . I would n't know . " " But you think as high as a hundred thousand ? " " If it was a legitimate sale . Certified authenticity . All that . Say , for example , Taos Pueblo decided to sell its cane . All legal and everything . I 'd say that would be low . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Civil War crazies all competing for it . But now you 've got to tell me why you 're asking . " " In a minute , " Leaphorn said . " Let 's say it was n't a public sale . Let 's say a dealer just approached a collector and said he had acquired one and wanted an offer . " " The collector calls the cops . " " Let 's say he was an unscrupulous collector . " " He still calls the cops , " Clark said . " Even quicker . He figures it 's a sting . He 's being set up . " " Okay , " Leaphorn said . " How about another possibility . Have n't some of those canes disappeared ? Down through the generations . Got lost or something ? What if ? " " Aah , " Clark said . " That opens a new can of worms . Yes . I 'm no authority on these Lincoln Canes . You could find out in the library . But I think some of the pueblos do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through pretty troubled times , you know . Like little Pojoaque , and Tesuque once , and Picuris . " " So let 's say somebody who really knows about such things gets his hands on one of those lost canes . Could he sell it ? " Silence while Clark considered . Then he said , " I doubt it . Probably not . " " Why not ? "  | " He would n't have any documentation . There are a few dealers who could do it , I think . People with such reputations for absolute integrity that their word would be accepted . " Clark considered what he had just said for a moment . " Well , " he added , " I 'd say their word plus a longish letter explaining the chronology of where the cane had been , whose hands it had passed through , and how it had come into their possession . " " Who are these honorable dealers ? " Leaphorn asked . " Besides you , I mean . " Silence again . Leaphorn wondered if that had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way it sounded , " he said . " This is nothing to joke about . " " Okay , " Clark said . " Maybe Clark Gallery , although we do n't do much of that big-money rare stuff . Let me think who else . " Silence again , and then he named an old but small gallery in Taos , another Santa Fe trader , one in Albuquerque , one in Gallup . " And a few independents , I think . I 'd say Elliot Pew down in Tucson , and J. D. Regis in Albuquerque , and Asher Davis in Santa Fe , and maybe old man Fishbien , if he 's still in the business . " Silence again . " It 's a short list . And there 's a lot more honest dealers . But the thing is it takes years to get that word-is-his-bond reputation . And collectors , they 're paranoid . If one of them gets screwed , or thinks he did , he spreads the word in that very small world and right away you could n't sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . Nobody 'll touch anything you 're selling . " " How would I find out if anybody has one of those missing Lincoln Canes ? "  | " You probably ca n't , " Clark said . " But if you want to try I 'll give you a name of a guy in Chicago . A guy named Bundy . He buys some little stuff from me but mostly he 's into Lincoln . For about forty years . He 'd be as likely to know as anyone . " The telephone in Chicago was answered by a man who switched Leaphorn to a woman . She identified herself as Mr. Bundy 's assistant , listened to his identification , took down Desmond Clark 's name , and put Leaphorn on hold . " This is Bundy , " the next voice said . It was an old voice , with the sound of smoke damage and too much whiskey . " I 'm Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn , Navajo Tribal Police , " Leaphorn said . " Mr. Clark thought you might be able to help me track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You know about the Lincoln Canes given to ? " " Of course , " Bundy said . " What 's your question ? " " It concerns the one Mr. Lincoln sent to Pojoaque Pueblo . Have you ever heard whether it has turned up in any collection , any museum ? " Silence . Then a hoarse , hooting laughter . " Excuse me , " Bundy said . " I 'll be damned . " " You 've heard something ? " Leaphorn asked . " I thought it was bullshit , " Bundy said . " Just a rumor I heard last summer . " He laughed again . " We have a little meeting , we Lincoln people . Annual get-together . Have a speaker in from one of the history departments , compare notes . One of my friends there said he 'd heard that a fellow , Florida fellow I believe it was , down in Miami ,  | had bought the Pojoaque cane . Said it had turned up somewhere out in the West . I did n't believe it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . I guess I could try to find out , but it 's probably going to take a day or two . What 's this about ? Is it impor-tant ? " " It 's about a murder , " Leaphorn said , and gave Mr. Bundy his home telephone number . Then he sat , and rocked back in Father Haines 's swivel chair , thinking about it . How about Asher Davis ? he thought . Perhaps Asher Davis had killed Dorsey . He put together a scenario that would explain how he might have been motivated to do it . But that left two big questions . Could there possibly have been two killers with separate motivations  --  making the link of the Lincoln Cane irrelevant ? If so , who had killed that koshare ? And why ? But that was more than two questions . And there was another one . How could he find a single shred of evidence to connect Davis to the Dorsey homicide ?  | THEIR HOUSE had never seemed emptier . Leaphorn had walked into the kitchen intending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would boil some water in the coffeepot and open one of those little sacks of dried soup . But as he walked across the linoleum tile , he became aware of the sound of his footsteps . That had n't happened to him since the days after he had returned from Emma 's funeral . He had left her mother 's place out beyond Rincon Largo and come home with a sense of personal failure  --  rare for him and thus all the more disturbing . He had fled on the second day of what Emma 's clan called " the time of blackening " ? when  | everyone wore at least a symbolic smudge of soot to make themselves invisible to the chindi . It had simply not been possible for him to think of the wife of his lifetime as a malevolent ghost . Emma existed in his mind ( and would always exist ) as someone laughing , beautiful , gentle , full of joy  --  someone who loved him even when he least deserved it . And so he had fled , skipping two of the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Emma 's clan demanded . Its purpose was worthy  --  lending the thoughts of those who loved her to accompany Emma on her four-day journey into what someone had called " that last great adventure . " But he hungered for isolation to become acquainted with his own sorrow . To get it , he had been willing to suffer the disapproval of Emma 's very traditional people . It was a weakness he had always regretted and often remembered . He remembered it now as he stood beside the sink  --  reminded by the sound of his own footsteps in an empty kitchen . He turned on the tap , watched it fill his glass , and took a small sip . The sound of crows overhead came through the window . They gathered each twilight in the cottonwoods around the Navajo Nation administrative offices for their nightly roost  --  a precise reminder of the earth 's turn away from the sun , of the inevitability of darkness . Where the devil was Jim Chee ? He took another sip of the cool water . Supper could wait . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken had this Chester problem not developed would be landing in Los Angeles just about now . If all went on schedule Louisa would have a bit more than an hour and a half to  | get to the international terminal , show the proper people her passport , and whatever other formalities were required . She would call him . He had dialed her number again last night , heard her answering machine 's voice , and hung up . Probably she would call him from the terminal . Perhaps she would be angry at his desertion ; perhaps she would be offended , her feelings hurt . He , doubted that . She seemed a very sensible person . Logical mind . Practical . She would have understood that circumstances made it impossible for him to go . He stood by the sink , holding the half-empty glass , wishing he could remember exactly what he had said in that message . Had he been specific enough ? That brought him to the question that he had been keeping buried somewhere . Why had n't she called him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office after he 'd deposited his message on her machine and he had n't been back . If she 'd called him at home , there was no machine to record it . He put down the glass and walked into the living room . He would turn on the television and watch the news . He would not think of Louisa Bourebonette . Instead , he found himself watching a car dealership commercial and thinking of Chee . Had he and Emma had a son he might have been like Chee , a complicated mixture of intelligence , romanticism , logic , and idealism . If Emma had been his influence he would have been , like ( ' hoe , at least trying to maintain his traditionalism . Had he taken after his father , he would have been  --  like Chee seemed to be  --  incompetent to understand women . Clearly the boy had his troubles there . Clearly he was  | enamored of that young lawyer . Miss Pete . Judging from signs of unhappiness Chee had been showing , that must not be going well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain Chee 's disappearance . Perhaps the rift had been healed and the lawyer and the cop were off somewhere enjoying each other 's company . The doorbell rang . That had been an unusual sound in this house for a long time . Who could that be ? Maybe Dilly Streib had uncovered something he wanted to tell him . Maybe Virginia had suggested that Streib drop by . Or maybe , with the same circumstances , it was Jim Chee . Where had Chee been ? He 'd have to make sure this absence without explanation business did n't happen again . Janet Pete was standing at his door , her little Ford Escort parked on the street . Miss Pete looked tired , slightly disheveled , glum , and nervous . " Well , " Leaphorn said . " Good evening . Come on in . " She followed him into the living room . " I apologize for coming like this , " she said . " Intruding into your privacy , I mean . But I could n't get you at your office and Virginia said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's perfectly all right , " Leaphorn said . This is another coincidence , he thought , happening to me , who does not believe in them . I am worrying about Chee and this young woman , and she appears to talk about him . It will be something personal . So what can I tell her ? He smiled at her . " Could I get you something to drink ? Something legal , of course . Possession of which is not prohibited in the Navajo Nation . I think I have some sort of soda pop in the refrigerator . Or I could put  | on some coffee if you 'd like it . And meanwhile , have a seat . " " Oh , no , " Miss Pete said . " Nothing for me . " But she sat in the chair he indicated . " I can only stay a moment . Just long enough to represent a client . " " Ah , " Leaphorn said , and sat across from her , thinking this was his week for guessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eugene Ahkeah , " she said . " So I heard . " " We had a long talk today , " Janet said . " Over at Crownpoint . " She hesitated . She will tell me something , or ask me a favor . Or perhaps both , Leaphorn thought . But she 's making this visit on an impulse . Worst possible time , right at supper . She has n't thought it through . She may change her mind . " Does Mr. Ahkeah have something to tell me ? " Leaphorn said . " No , " she said . " Well , not exactly . I guess I do . " She laughed , shook her head . " Your assistant , Officer Chee , suggested that I tell you my client is innocent . After today , I 'm sure he is . He did n't kill Eric Dorsey . He did n't steal all those items you found in the box under his house . " " Chee said you should tell me Ahkeah was innocent ? When ? Did you see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , surprised at the intensity of his tone . " It was last week . " " Not something he knew , then , " Leaphorn said , making a gesture of dismissal . " We 've been working on separate things and I have n't seen him for a few days . I thought perhaps you were bringing me a dispatch from wherever Chee is spending his time these days . "  | Miss Pete looked faintly alarmed . " I think he has some days off , " she said . " Correct , " Leaphorn said . " And he 's taking them . " Miss Pete had collected herself . " This may sound unprofessional  --  my coming to you instead of going through the usual legal channels . But I know going to the U.S. attorney would n't do any good , and I 'm not sure what you will say and so the worst I can do is waste some of our time . " She paused , picked up the handbag she 'd placed on the chair beside her , and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize you have a lot of circumstantial evidence , " Janet said . " The stolen materials under his house , principally , although no search warrant was issued as far as I can find out so far and that probably wo n't be admitted in court . I guess you can probably place him at the scene of the homicide at about the right time , and perhaps you have some other evidence . But given time I think I 'll be able to show he was set up , that the crime was actually done by the man who made that anonymous telephone call about the box under Ahkeah 's house . " She paused , awaited a Leaphorn reaction to all this , received a smile and a nod instead of the argument she 'd expected , and hurried on . " There 's simply no motive for Ahkeah to have done it . The prosecution will argue that the motive was theft . He needed to get money to buy whiskey . But he did n't sell the stuff . He did n't buy whiskey . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . Miss Pete flushed slightly . She picked up the purse  | and put it on the chair beside her and cleared her throat . " Totally aside from his innocence , Mr. Ahkeah is certainly no risk to become a fugitive . He has no connections off the reservation . He does n't have any money , no way to run and no place to hide . He does n't even speak very much English . There 's really no reason to hold him in a cell under a bond he ca n't possibly raise . " Miss Pete stopped , looked at him , waited for a response . " What would you like me to do ? " " I came to ask you if you would ask Mr. Streib to recommend to the court that Mr. Ahkeah be released on his own recognizance . " Leaphorn thought a moment . " All right , " he said . Miss Pete looked startled . She picked up the purse and put it down again . " All right ? You mean you 'll do it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at his watch . " I 'll give him time to eat his supper . I think he 'll go along with it . Mr. Streib is usually pretty reasonable . " He was watching Miss Pete , who was struggling to replace the amazement on her face with something less revealing . She won the battle , and then produced a nervous laugh . " You know , " she said , " Jim said : Tell the lieutenant Ahkeah is innocent and he 'll turn him loose . ' I thought he was just kidding . " " He was , " Leaphorn said , smiling at her . " It just happens that I agree with you . Even if Ahkeah did it , he is n't going to run anywhere that we ca n't find him . And you may be right about him being not guilty . "  | Miss Pete had recomposed herself . " I wish the police would concentrate on finding who it was who set Ahkeah up . I think that 's what happened . Whoever killed Mr. Dorsey saw Ahkeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decided he 'd be perfect as the fall guy . " " Possibly , " Leaphorn said . He was thinking , I like this young woman . I like the way she works for her client , and maybe I will be needing a lawyer myself if they decide to charge me with concealing evidence of an illegal wiretap . And he was thinking that he could see now why she appealed to his assistant . " Do you know where I can find Jim Chee ? " Miss Pete looked surprised . " No . " " Or how to get a message to him ? " " No . " Leaphorn allowed himself to look disappointed , which was easy , because he was . " I thought you might , " he said . " I have gotten the impression that Jim counts his time wasted when you are not nearby . " It seemed to Leaphorn that Miss Pete looked sad to hear this . " We 've been friends a long time , " she said . " He tells me his troubles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a shrug , but her expression canceled that . " It 's good to have someone you can talk to like that , " Leaphorn said . " I apologize . I must be sounding like an overaged cupid . I guess I read Jim all wrong . We have an old hit-and-run case  --  totally hopeless  --  but the chief wants it solved and there 's probably a promotion there for whoever can nail the guy . I think Chee 's working on it  | hard because he thinks with sergeant stripes he would look to you more like a worthy marriage prospect . " Miss Pete 's expression , if Leaphorn read it right , went from irritation , to surprise , to sorrow . She exhaled , picked up the purse again , and put it down . " I do n't normally behave like this , " Leaphorn said . " Normally I 'm pretty good at minding my own business . Herd your own sheep , ' as my mother used to teach us . I 'm Jim 's boss and I like him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about him too , " she said . " But I think you have sort of misinterpreted things . " She produced a weak smile . " So did I. 1 was thinking in terms of Romeo and Juliet . The wrong families and all that . " It took Leaphorn a moment to understand . " Clans , " he said , and made a wry face . " Well , actually I think the clan business is all very ambiguous . Only my father was a Navajo . And it 's hazy on his side , too . But Jim , you know , I think maybe he 's not the marrying kind . So , even a hazy , ambiguous clan taboo can be useful . " " Ummm , " Leaphorn said . What in the world was he doing , he thought , behaving just as Emma would behave , trying to be a matchmaker ? This was absolutely none of his business . But he had found that he liked Janet Pete . Ile had n't expected to like her . And when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim Chee , too . So , to hell with it , he would continue interfering . Emma would n't believe he was doing this , but she would certainly approve . " ' There 's something hard for normal people to  | understand about Jim Chee , " he said . " He 's an odd sort of idealist . He wants to become a practicing hataalii . He wants to be a bona fide traditionalist . To be a singer of the curing ceremonials . Not just to be a shaman , but to be a really effective one . " Leaphorn paused , looking for some general statement to sum this up , and his own attitude toward it . " It makes any sort of taboo more powerful than it would be to me  --  and probably to you . Officer Chee wants to save his people from the future . " Janet Pete had listened to all this intently , without fiddling with her purse . Now she picked it up , and got up , and said , " I have to go . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " I guess Officer Chee will show up again someday . " " I guess so , " she said , and turned to look at him . " Were you serious about calling Mr. Streib ? " Leaphorn looked at his watch . " Right now , " he said .  | JIM CHEE , born to the Slow Talking Dinee ' , born for the Bitter Water Clan , whose real , ceremonial , and secret name was actually Long Thinker , awoke on the floor of Gracie Cayodito 's hogan just when dawn was invading the extreme eastern edge of the night . He was awakened by the voice of his uncle , who was standing outside the east-facing door of the hogan , singing his blessing song to the new day . As Chee lay there , stiff from a night on this unyielding bed and still only half-awake , a second voice joined the husky baritone of Frank Sam Nakai . This one was older , cracked and scratchy  --  the sound of Hosteen Bar-  | bone shouting his greeting to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own dawn prayer a bit later , after he 'd started the coffee perking and the eastern sky was red with morning . He groaned , pushed himself upright , tucked in his shirt , and fished out from under it the buckskin medicine pouch , which contained his corn pollen . When in Rome , he thought , one does as the Romans do . He did n't want to worsen the bad impression he had already made on these old men . But later , with the sun up and the town of Window Rock in view through his windshield , he was pretty sure the perfect knowledge he 'd displayed of the morning blessing had n't made any difference . The problem was the generation gap . The problem was theological . The problem was how one defined the concept of hozho , that idea of harmony which was the very root and foundation of the Navajo religion . This kind of problem was n't what he wanted when he 'd gone back up the mountain to find his uncle again . He 'd been in a crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did had been the last straw . Too much ambiguity , uncertainty , indecision . He wanted no more of that . He would go to the mountains and get a ruling on whether he could marry Janet Pete and still be a Navajo in the traditional sense . That took him through Farmington , right past the Quikprint shop . He slammed on the brakes , backed , pulled into a parking place . He had three different bumper stickers made , timing the process . It took almost thirteen minutes and , yes , it was expensive . Then he drove faster than the law allowed , making up for the lost time . He 'd wanted a favorable ruling . He had imagined  | the scene  --  an old , old man recounting the history of the Hunger People from the clan 's day one , proving that these people had never joined with his own ancestors , never made common cause , never did any of those things that would make them linked in blood . Then he would tell Janet . And what would she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me I 'm taboo . Like maybe I had AIDS . And I do n't meet your high Navajo standards . And then you can come back and say I passed your test . Well , screw you , old friend . Or maybe the ruling would be negative . Even a negative ruling was better than this ambiguity . With that he could at least make a clear-cut deci-sion . But the great conference at the Cayodito hogan had drifted away from anything specific into the misty world of Changing Woman , First Man and First Woman , Talking God , and the great galaxy of other yeis . Frank Sam Nakai had heard Chee 's truck coming up the muddy road and was standing in the doorway of his hogan . " I have been asking and I have found the man who will know about the Hunger People and your own clans , " his uncle had said . " He lives over by Crystal . We will go and listen to what he will tell us . " The man who would know was named Barbone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was called " Hosteen " in respect for his years and his wisdom . But , of course , when they turned off the pavement of Navajo Route 32 and jolted down the road past the old Crystal trading post and up the crooked tracks into the aspen grove where Barbone had built his hogan , they discov-  | ered that Hosteen Barbone was not at home . His daughter , who seemed to Chee to be about seventy-five , said he had gone to the place of Gracie Cayodito to decide what sort of ceremonial was needed to cure a Cayodito grandchild of an illness . On the road again , eastward out of the Chuskas to Route 666 , north to the Two Grey Hills turnoff , then back into the Chuskas on the road which led  --  when and if weather permitted  --  to the Toh-Ni Tsa forest fire lookout tower . A badly used Chevy Blazer and a pickup truck were parked at the Cayodito place . Gracie was there . So was Hosteen Barbone , looking old enough to have a daughter over seventy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sat a woman who looked even older than Barbone . Old Woman Mustache . Chee had heard of her somewhere  --  had heard that she was the wise person of the Streams Come Together Clan . About an hour into the ensuing discussion , Chee decided that Old Woman Mustache either was mute or had fallen asleep . Hosteen Barbone covered the genesis of the Hunger People , how the clan had formed and gotten its name during Naahondzibd , the " Fearing Time " when the American army had joined the Mexicans and Utes in the war against the Dinee ' , and the men were afraid to leave on a hunt because they might return to find their hogans burned , their wives slaughtered , and their children taken by the soldiers , to be sold in the slave market at Santa Fe . " They say that 's when the Hunger People began . They say that Kit Carson came through there , came through about where Many Farms is now , with horse sol-  | diers and some Utes . They killed the people they caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the corn and pinon nuts and blankets , and gathered up the children to sell them in Santa Fe . My grandmother said they got a hundred and fifty dollars for her . A rancher way down the Rio Grande bought her and had her baptized but she ran away and got back to the Jemez Pueblo and they sent her back to where her family was but her family was all gone . They say that only one man in that camp had a gun and when he tried to fight the soldiers with it , it would n't shoot . The soldiers killed that one and just a few people got away up into the mountains . And they found other people hiding there , mostly women and children . They say they were from all over . From other camps where the soldiers had come through and cut down the orchards and burned the food and stolen the horses . A lot of them starved or froze to death during that winter , but Carson never did capture them so they did n't go on the Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans released the Dinee ' from that prison and they came back to Dine ' Bike'yah , these people had their own clan . They say that since they came from all over they could n't name them with the place they came from , so everybody called them the Hunger People . " Hosteen Barbone had given them the beginnings of the Hunger People , as he had heard it . Now he would give them the rest of that clan 's history . And when that was finished , they would hear from Gracie Cayodito , and perhaps from Old Woman Mustache if she was n't asleep . Chee had been raised among the traditionals ,  | among the sheep camp and hogan people . He knew how to sit comfortably and be patient . If he was lucky , Bar-bone 's account would never , in any way , link the Hunger People with the clans of his own mother or father . And so he listened , trying to keep track of contacts and relationships between maternal clans , paternal clans , offshoot fragments of clans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Barbone fell silent . The silence extended long enough to signal that his account was finished . He had talked about an hour , Chee thought , but he resisted the impulse to confirm this with a glance at his watch . Into the silence Old Woman Mustache spoke . " Too much talk about those father 's clans , " she said in a voice that was very old but surprisingly clear . " Remember in the Fourth World when the women got tired of the men and went across the river and pleasured themselves . Remember what the Holy People taught us then . That men have their things to do , and women have their things to do , and one of the woman 's things is the family . Remember what they taught us then . The mother 's clan , the clan you 're born for , that 's the one that is important . " Having said that , with long pauses for breathing between sentences , Old Woman Mustache closed her eyes and rested . Gracie Cayodito spoke next . She began with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navajos pass along information without making any personal claim to it . In the case of Gracie Cayodito the form did not represent any self-doubts . She took them through the histories of Chee 's two clans .  | Since her sources of data considered the Bitter Water Dinee ' one of the original four formed by Changing Woman herself , she took them back to the mythic days when the spirits called Holy People still walked the Earth surface world with the humans they had formed . Gracie Cayodito covered this history with relative speed , but digressed often into the heresies being committed by the contemporary shamans who violated the old rules of ritualism , and , with hard looks at Jim Chee , related the horrors produced by violations of the incest taboo . " People who have sex with their sisters , " she said , looking at Chee . " That causes craziness . That causes people to jump into the fire . " ' But , alas , when she had finally finished , whether Janet Pete was indeed his sister remained unclear in Chee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more strongly than Hosteen Barbone did about adapting ceremonials as old as the dawn of time to the terminal years of the twentieth century . Then Hosteen Frank Sam Nakai spoke  --  not long , but long enough to underline the important points . First , nobody could tell for sure whether or not this daughter of the man from the Hunger People was a clan sister of this son of the Slow Talking People and the Bitter Water Dinee ' , and second , the Beauty Way of the Navajo people was being undermined by young shamans who were too lazy to learn the rules the Holy People had taught , or too willing to do ceremonies the wrong way and thus adapt them to the world of the bilagaani . Chee parked his muddy pickup in the POLICE CARS ONLY area at the office and waited for the place to offi-  | cially open at 8 A.M. He would check in with Leaphorn and then ... But no . He 'd forgotten . Leaphorn would be gone . Off on his great China trip . Gone for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have checked in with the lieutenant yesterday . Should have told him good-bye and gotten his final instructions . Leaphorn would probably want him to do something about the Jimmy Chester-Ed Zeck telephone call . He 'd probably want to talk about how they could get some evidence against Chester that could be used in court . Probably want to bring in Dilly Streib . Maybe help set up an FBI sting operation . He glanced at his watch . Couple of more minutes and Virginia would be there . If he 'd guessed right about the lieutenant , there 'd be an envelope awaiting him , full of instructions on what to do and how to do it . He allowed himself a final review of what last night 's session meant to him . Whether Janet was his clan sister , even vaguely , remained in doubt . But , but , but ... There was no doubt at all that for Hosteen Barbone and Gracie Cayodito and , much worse , Frank Sam Nakai , his own Little Father , mere absence of proof was not good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank Sam Nakai had finished his summation they had all sat in silence for a while , watching the fire burn down under the smoke hole . And then the old woman had spoken : " You have wasted words , " she said . " Too much talk of men and the man 's clan . Nothing matters but the mother 's clan . " But what the devil did that mean to him ? Janet 's mother was a white . There was no mother 's clan . lie  | climbed out of the truck , and slammed the door behind him . Virginia looked no happier than he felt . " Where have you been ? " she demanded . " Lieutenant Leaphorn was looking everywhere for you . " " Took my days off , " Chee said . " Did he leave anything for me ? " " Not with me , " she said , and glared at him . Nor , to Chee 's surprise , was there a fat envelope in his in-basket . There was absolutely nothing in it . Leaphorn 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was locked . Unusual , but understandable under the circumstances . He would n't want to leave it open for a month . Chee trotted downstairs , past Virginia 's now-vacant desk , and out to his car . This felt odd . With Leaphorn in China for a month he was totally on his own . Well , not quite . He probably should report to the chief , as the lieutenant did . But that could wait until he had a little time to think . To do that he 'd go home . Maybe he 'd even get a little sleep . He pulled his truck out of the lot , stopping to let the northbound traffic pass . The third car looked like Leaphorn 's . And Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn was driving it .  | WHEN JOE LEAPHORN realized that the dirty pickup truck tagging behind him belonged to Jim Chee and saw , through the mud-speckled windshield , that Chee was driving it , his instinctive reaction was to pull off on the shoulder and start asking questions immediately . But he resisted that impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own street , pulled into his driveway , and turned off the ignition . By the time Chee had parked on the street , Leaphorn was standing beside his truck . " Where have you been ? " Leaphorn asked , pleased that he 'd kept the emotion out of his voice . " I thought you 'd gone to China , " Chee said . It was  | the wrong thing to say . Chee realized that instantly from Leaphorn 's expression . " I had some days off , " he added . " You 've been out of communication for two days , " Leaphorn said . " You know the rule about that . " " Yes sir , " Chee said . Leaphorn stared at him . " Are you telling me that since I was supposed to be in China you could take off without going through the procedure ? " " No sir , " Chee said . " I forgot . I had other things on my mind . " " Like what ? " Like Janet Pete , Chee thought . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her by telling her she was taboo . But to hell with Leaphorn . That was none of his business . " Like I think I may have solved that Todachene hit-and-run case , " he said . And as soon as he said it , he regretted it . " And like what to do about Ed Zeck and Councilman Chester , " he added , hoping that would change the subject . " Ed Zeck and Councilman Chester , " Leaphorn said , with a question in his voice . " Yeah , " Chee said . " What did you think of that tape ? The one I left in your tape player ? " Through years of police work , of questioning people to whom he did n't want to show his reaction to their answers , Joe Leaphorn had learned to control his expression . He could hear the best news , or the worst , behind the same bland and neutral face . But not now . His cheeks flushed , blood rushed to his forehead , the lines around his mouth tightened . Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only lasted a moment . Relief replaced fury . The veils of mystery had fallen away . He was n't the victim of some unknown malice , the target of a shrewd and secret enemy . He was a victim of simpleminded boneheadedness . No more suspension , or risk of dismissal , or hiring a lawyer to defend against a charge of conspiracy to suppress evidence . All of that could be fixed tomorrow morning . Leaphorn felt weak with relief . He leaned a hand against Chee 's truck . And then he remembered what this boneheadedness had cost him . " Why did you leave that tape in my player ? " His expression was neutral again , but the voice was cold . Chee hastily explained how that had happened , and why the call telling him the Todachene suspect had confessed over KNDN up in Farmington had caused him to rush away without an explanation . " I wanted to get right on that before it got cold , " Chee concluded , and looked at Leaphorn to see if the explanation had created the mollifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it in Leaphorn 's expression . Leaphorn stood there studying Chee , saying nothing . " About the Chester tape , " Chee said . " You were asking me if I knew of any evidence of bribery . I know it ca n't be used  --  the tape , I mean . It must have come from an illegal telephone tap . But maybe it will persuade the federals to so something . " " What do you know about how it came to be broad-cast ? " " Just what was in the police report , " Chee said . " The standard middle-aged , middle-sized ' man walked into the Navajo Tractor Sales office . The radio station has an  | open mike there for announcements . He got in line with the other people and when his turn came he held the tape player up to the mike and broadcast it and then he just walked out . " " You had nothing to do with it ? " " No sir , " Chee said , loudly . " Nothing . Absolutely nothing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . " Chee paused . " Except I guess Roger Applebee did it . The lawyer lobbying against that toxic waste dump . " He told Leaphorn how he 'd met Applebee while having lunch with Janet Pete and what Applebee had said about getting some concrete evidence . " It ca n't be used in court , of course . But maybe he thought it would cause the FBI to get interested . Maybe to set up a sting . Something like that . " " I doubt it , " Leaphorn said . Chee was surprised . " Well , " he said . " They 're into that sort of thing now , the federals are . Running stings . They 've been nailing politicians here and there for accepting bribes . And twenty-something thousand dollars is a lot of money . " Leaphorn studied Chee a moment , sighed , and made a decision . Under the circumstances , when he was Chee 's age he might have done what Chee had done . " Councilman Chester and Ed Zeck have been in the cattle business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They run bred heifers on Chester 's grazing lease and a Bureau of Land Management lease that Zeck holds . The twenty-something thousand dollars is exactly what it takes to pay off a Farmington Bank of New Mexico loan  | Chester signed to buy the heifers . Zeck sold them to the feed lot people , but he had n't deposited the check . " " Oh , " Chee said . " Only thing wrong about the deal was the price of beef went down and they lost a little money on the proj-ect , " Leaphorn said . " But Dilly Streib is going to want to talk to you about an illegal wiretap , and maybe about that radio broadcast . " " Sure , " Chee said . He wanted to ask Leaphorn why he was wearing civilian clothing on a workday . Maybe he 'd misunderstood . Maybe it was tomorrow that Leaphorn was leaving for China . " Call Streib and tell him , " said Leaphorn . " And call Captain Dodge and explain the tape business to him . And let 's get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chee said . " The Todachene thing . Have you found him ? " " Well , " Chee said . " I think I have the driver spotted . But I need to find the truck before we have any evidence . I have n't located it yet . " He stopped , hoping Leaphorn would n't press him for details . Leaphorn did n't . " Let that go for a while . We want to pick up that Kanitewa boy and find out if he saw anything that day at Eric Dorsey 's shop . " He told Chee what he had learned about the Tano Lincoln Cane and the Pojoaque Lincoln Cane and about collectors of historic rarities , and his conclusions about Asher Davis . " It 's like your Todachene suspect , though , " Leaphorn said . " We do n't have any concrete evidence . Just circumstantial stuff . Unless the Kanitewa kid saw something helpful . "  | Chee cleared his throat . " You mean , " he said , " Asher Davis killed Eric Dorsey ? " " Except we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chee said . " Asher Davis was out on the Hopi Reservation when Dorsey was killed . He was out there with Cowboy Dashee , buying stuff from Dashee 's relatives . About the time Dorsey was killed they were eating lunch with Dashee 's uncle at the Hopi Cultural Center . " Leaphorn lost his neutral expression again . But only for a moment . " Well , now , " he said . " That 's interesting . " Chee cleared his throat again . " Lieutenant , was I wrong about you taking leave and going to China ? Did I get the date wrong ? " " No , " Leaphorn said . " I had to call it off . I got suspended and I had to stay for the investigation . " " My God ! " Chee said . " Suspended ! Why would you get suspended ? " Leaphorn told him .  | " THE OLD BATTLE-AX did a lot of talking , " Harold Blizzard said . " She 'd talk about absolutely everything except where she was hiding the kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go out there myself , " Chee said . " You just do n't seem to be catching on about how to interrogate people . " " I can interrogate people all right , " Blizzard said . " Normal people , I have no problem . It 's you Navajos . You know that stereotype about us Indians being taciturn ? " Blizzard raised a huge palm toward Chee and growled " Ugggh " to illustrate his point . " Well , that 's based on the rest of us Indians . Cheyennes , Cherokees , Choctaws ,  | Comanches , Chippewas , Modocs , Kiowas , Seminoles , Potts , Hopis . Normal Indians . But whoever decided Indians were silent had n't run into you talkative Navajos . " " You 're telling me she did n't just flat-out deny she knew where Delmar could be located ? Is that right ? She just was n't willing to tell you ? " Blizzard used his big right hand to demonstrate lips flapping . " She 'd just talk about what a lousy job we policemen did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And how would she know Delmar would be safe if we had him in our custody ? And how she knew we would n't post a guard on him , or anything like that . And on , and on . " " Did you ask her why she thought he needed a guard ? " " Sure , I did . And she 'd then just give me five more minutes about how lazy we cops were . And then I 'd tell her she was judging us by the performance of you guys . " Blizzard cut off his own chuckle and Chee 's response to that by signaling the waitress and pointing to their coffee cups . " Hey , " he said . " There 's your lawyer lady . We 're going to need another cup . " There , indeed , was Janet Pete , standing in the entrance of the Navajo Nation Inn coffee shop , looking hesitant . She saw that Chee had seen her , and turned away . Pretending , it seemed to Chee , to be looking for someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stood , waving . Harold Blizzard was far too large , far too loud to be ignored .  | Janet came . She looked at Chee and looked away . " Hello , Harold , " she said . " Hello , Jim . " Chee stood and pulled back a chair for her . " I met a friend of yours the other day , " Blizzard said . " Jim 's friend , too , I guess . Fellow named Asher Davis . He said if he was n't about sixty pounds overweight , you two could provide him a perfect alibi in that homicide over at Tano Pueblo . " " Oh , " Janet said . She glanced at Chee , and away . " He 's on the list the feds gave me of people to check out . About a thousand or so . " " I guess he 's right , " Janet said . " He went there with Mr. Chee and Cowboy Dashee and me . And when we decided to watch the ceremony from the roof , he decided he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That was before the clowns came out with the wagonload of stuff ? " Blizzard asked . " Or was it after ? " " I think it was before , " Janet said . " Yes , it was right at the very beginning . " " That 's the way I remember it , too , " Chee said . He was thinking Leaphorn told Streib about the Lincoln Canes , and Streib told the Albuquerque FBI , and Blizzard knows his business better than I gave him credit for . " Are you thinking of Davis as maybe a suspect ? " Blizzard gave him a stern look . " Just my native curiosity , " he said . " I understand Davis looked good for it after the business of the Lincoln Canes came out , " Chee said . " But it turns out he was with an Apache County deputy sheriff over on the Hopi Reservation when Eric Dorsey was killed . "  | Blizzard looked surprised , then angry . " God-dammit , " he said . " Why do n't anybody ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis was a suspect , " Janet said . " And wait a minute . I thought you were talking about the Sayesva case . What 's the Dorsey killing have to do with that ? Which one are you talking about ? " " Nobody tells me about anything either , " Chee said . " I 've been out of touch . I just heard about the phony Lincoln Canes this morning . " " Phony Lincoln whats ? " Janet said . " I still have n't heard about them . " And so Chee explained , skipping  --  Navajo fashion ? back to the very beginning with the Spanish King Charles sending canes to the Indian pueblos in the seventeenth century , from there to 1863 , thence to Leaphorn 's discovery of the sketch on Dorsey 's desk . He concluded finally with the presumption that the package Delmar Kanitewa had taken to his koshare uncle was a copy of the Tano cane , and the koshare put it in the wagon to warn against selling pueblo artifacts . " I 'd never even heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is it your official theory of the crime ' now that this cane ties the two homicides together ? Same killer for the man who made it and the man who used it ? " " I 'd say so , " Chee said . " More or less . " " How 's it work ? " Janet asked . " Sort of like this , " Chee said , happy that Janet was once again talking directly to him and even looking at him . Maybe we 're almost back again to being old friends ,  | he thought . And maybe that was all he could ever hope for . " Somebody hires Dorsey to make the Pojoaque cane , knowing he can sell it to a collector of Lincoln rarities because the cane from that pueblo disappeared generations ago . So he has Dorsey make such a cane , not telling Dorsey what it is or about the fraud . Then he decides to try again with the Tano cane and gets Dorsey to make it . Delmar Kanitewa shows up at the shop while Dorsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he 's a Tano kid . Delmar tells Dorsey what it is . " Chee paused , looked at Janet . " You have to understand this Dorsey is a genuine straight arrow . Into doing good . Now he figures something crooked must be going on and he 's being used . Probably he figures the real cane is going to be stolen and this one used to replace it so the theft wo n't be noticed . So he gives it to Delmar to take to his uncle with a warning about the impending theft . And then the guy who commissioned it shows up to collect it , and Dorsey jumps on him about it and the guy kills Dorsey to protect his secret . " Blizzard made a wry face . " It sounds too damned complicated , " he said . " I like ' em simpler . Like the janitor walks in drunk and tries to borrow money and gets turned down and gets mad and knocks off Dorsey and steals some stuff . " " I do n't like that Blizzard theory at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know about the other one either . " She thought . " How could this guy sell the second cane ? Nobody would buy it . Collectors know about these things or they would n't be collecting them . They 'd know that Tano Pueblo still had its Lincoln Cane . And so they 'd  | know that the one they 'd bought was a fake , or , worse yet , the one they bought was stolen . " " So they could n't brag about it . Or show it off , " Blizzard said . " So why buy it ? " " And why use Dorsey ? " " He had connections with some traders , " Chee said . " We know that because he was helping some of the Navajos out on the Checkerboard get better prices for their stuff . " He paused , remembering what the old woman with the ill husband had told him . " Including some old stuff that the real collectors go for . " " Okay , but I still see holes in it , " Janet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Chee admitted . The waitress arrived , bringing Janet a cup of coffee and a refill for Chee and Blizzard . " You know , " Blizzard said . " I think maybe all three of us are in the same boat I was in at that Cheyenne Autumn movie the other night . I could n't understand why all the Navajos were hooting and blowing their car horns . Different culture . Different perceptions . There 's probably some Tano Pueblo connection here we just do n't fathom . " He made a wide , Blizzard-style gesture with his hands . " Different value systems , you know . Hard fortis outsiders to comprehend . " " Yes , " Janet said in a voice almost too low for Chee to hear . " Hard to comprehend . " " Janet , " Chee said . He reached his hand toward her . - ('here 's something I 'd like to explain . " She put down her cup and sat back , not looking at him . " Well , now , " Blizzard said , hastily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He picked up the ticket . " You get the tip , " he said to Chee . " See you later , Janet . " And he was gone . " Me too , " Janet said . " I 've got to go . " " Where ? " Chee said . " First to Crownpoint . The federals are releasing Ahkeah and I have to do the paperwork . " " I 'm going that direction , " Chee said . " Could I give you a ride ? " " I have to go on from there up to Aztec . I have some business at the San Juan County courthouse . " " That 's right on my way , " Chee said . " I 'd better take my own car , " she said . " You 'd have to wait for me . " She got up , dropped a dollar on the table . " My share of the tip . " " Janet , " Chee said . " I want to talk to you . " " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking up at her . He could think of nothing to say . But his expression must have said something to her . " What could we talk about ? " she asked . " Do you think we can go back to being friends ? " Chee shook his head . " I doubt it . I do n't think I could . " He put his hand out . She looked at it . Then took it . Her fingertips felt soft and warm against his skin . " Just a few hours , " he said . " What do we talk about ? " " The weather . The landscape . Old times , maybe , if we 're careful how we handle it . And I think maybe I want you to help me make up my mind about something . " She extracted her hand .  | " Not about Navajo clans , " he said . " About something you must have studied in law school . Justice . Retribution . Social revenge . Ethics . All that . " She managed a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In fact , they talked very little on their way to Crownpoint . East of Gallup , Chee pointed to the places along the red sandstone cliffs of Mesa de los Lobos where various movies had been shot . He explained that Thoreau was pronounced " threw " because the village had been named after a railroad engineer and not the poet-essayist . He pointed southward to Little Haystack Mountain and told her how a Navajo prospector named Paddy Martinez had found a vein of radioactive pitchblende near there and opened the great Ambrosia Lake uranium mining district . He told her , finally , about the chain of events that had gotten Leaphorn suspended , and had caused the lieutenant to miss his trip to China . " It was a stupid thing to do , " he said . " Leaving that tape in there , I mean . Leaphorn did n't make much out of it , but I feel terrible about it . " " I did n't think I would like that man at first , " Janet said . " But I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to just think he was smart . " " He 's smart , all right . " " That 's what he thinks about you , too . " " Why do you say that ? " " The way he talked about you . " " What do you mean ? When did you talk to him ?
