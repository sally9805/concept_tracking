Glenn Thrip failed to notice the bullet hole in the rear window of his pickup until several days later , after they had removed his wisdom teeth . Snowed on codeine , he was clearing the Nissan 's floor of pennies , trying to extract the keys from beneath the mat , when he looked up and saw the fresh Amnesty International emblem in the window 's lower left corner . A silver filigree of cracks ran from the edges and into the safety glass . He peeled back the sticker and found an identical black and gold emblem holding the window together from the outside . The hole was nearly the diameter of his ring finger , and he tested the edge . It was too much . Glenn Thrip was only fifty-six hours past his confrontation with the oral surgeon , and at that moment , facing anything more than the rote act of driving seemed well beyond reason . He began an inching U-turn across Valentine Place . Out on East State , descending toward his now cooling order of takeout lasagna , he remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could recall Marni Coe , yesterday on the phone , before she returned the truck , asking if he had any preferences in bumper stickers . Offhand , Thrip did n't , which surprised him , as there were definite preferences for nearly everything else . People used to think of Glenn 's surname as a kind of verb . " I thrip . You thrip . We 're in the grip of thrip , " they 'd say and laugh . <p> In front of his landlord 's house on North Geneva , Thrip reached for the stereo , forgetting that it would be the Ramones . The Ramones or nothing , that 's how the world had been for a while , as the tape was stuck in the deck . After completing a vague series of left-hand turns , and convinced that he 'd undershot the lasagna , Thrip began trying to picture his navigational mistake , when the take-out place materialized at the corner . He slowed as a black Celica with smoked windows pulled quickly around him . Violet-white light spilled from the undercarriage and reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the four-lane traffic of Route 13 sliding out on a spectral pillow of purple . <p> Inside Roma 's the tanned kid behind the counter in a lacrosse jersey had just hung up the phone . " People always say I ordered an hour ago . Always an hour ago . " His flour-dusted fingers snapped in the air . " What am I supposed to do ? Feel guilty ? " Thrip nodded . The remote on the counter was wrapped in plastic . <p> They bagged his order while Thrip examined the dining room beyond the TV as if it were a wall-sized painting . And why not ? Why should n't it simply be another psychic law of the universe ? That the person you most wish to avoid is always randomly and immediately accessible ? In among the booths , Marni Coe sat across from a burly man with the beard of a physicist . She waved Glenn over . <p> " Greetings , Thrip . " Marni apologized , but his name did still sound like a salutation . Thrip smoothed the back of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a gesture he often made when faced with a surprise . Marni Coe was a horticulture grad student and tiny . A turf grass specialist with deep-set , unpredictable eyes . In truth , she was actually a friend of Eleanor 's , and had borrowed Thrip 's truck to move Walter 's stuff into storage before he left for a post-doc in Seattle . Walter stopped dismantling the white garlic pizza and squinted . His beard appeared to have sprung from his face with no sense of direction and simply curled . Was he applied or theoretical ? Glenn could n't remember . <p> " You 've looked better , " Marni said , regarding the greenish-yellow bruises on Thrip 's jaw . The sockets , the spaces where his wisdom teeth had been , still throbbed . This was better than yesterday , though , when Thrip could barely open his mouth and had to stay on the couch sucking tea bags to control the bleeding . " Walter thanks you for the truck , " Marni Coe said . <p> And how does one bring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small one , but still . " When did you bring it back ? " Thrip asked . <p> " This morning , but early . I thought you 'd be asleep so I did n't knock . Any news from Eleanor ? " <p> " Nope . " When she was n't doing field work in Louisiana , Eleanor lived with Thrip . It was a romantic arrangement that Thrip , at times , thought could clearly go either way . " Soft food , " he said , lifting the white bag and backing toward the door . In the truck , he saw that Marni Coe had left him a full tank of gas . <p> Nobody expected Thrip at work , particularly on a Friday , but the next afternoon he woke from a dream where he 'd been assigned to stuff pillows into blue jars , as container ships headed for open ocean beyond his window . Thrip arched his back . He had been sitting around the house far too long beneath this shroud of left-over anesthesia . How many forgotten bowls of mashed potatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some larger lethargy ? He would go in and open envelopes , maybe use a few paper clips . <p> Work waited across two gorges in a cluster of half-timbered chalets at the university 's fringe . Thrip did permissions  --  he was the Czar of Permissions  --  for a small academic press . He evaluated requests , reexamined contracts , hunted lost volumes , and released letters with bills attached back to the world . " In reply to your recent request we are pleased to grant you one-time rights to quote from page 237 of the Zeiss volume in your upcoming : Beewolves : A Saga of Solitary Ground Nesting Wasps . " Thrip 's second-floor office had once been a kitchen . <p> Compensationally challenged or merely income-impaired ? These were questions his older brother , the water rights attorney , asked late at night from San Antonio . " Be a big picture guy , " he 'd say . " Detail is a drug , " he 'd explain . " Have a direction , " he 'd suggest , as if it were a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconnoiter from after one and a half nonessential master 's degrees . Thrip saw that . Yet he had been up there for more than <p> year , immobile and baffled , wending his way into the long term , and now he could imagine a fair portion of his life streaming by below , filling in like bitter petrified wood . <p> Fat number-ten envelopes were splayed across Thrip 's desk like fish . Seventy-two fish , to be exact . He culled the foreign ones , saved their stamps for his niece , and paired up the duplicate requests . September was a bad time for permissions , as all the college copy shops wanted immediate action on their course packets . Even so , when the dentist saw Thrip 's impacted wisdom teeth , he called this " a good window , " an occasion to confront the decay . Later , during the preliminary examination , the oral surgeon gave Thrip his choice of anesthesia . Yet after she said , " These two in the bone might come out in bits , " and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what I 'm doing , " and finally , " Oh my , this one 's inflamed , " Thrip agreed to skip the local and take the general . One week later , his mouth dry from the pre-op tranquilizer , the needle went in , and Thrip disappeared from time . He woke as a rubbery male voice said , " Walk to the chair . Breathe " and Thrip 's feet went on ahead . After a friend from work got him home and up the steps , one of the neighbors came over , convinced that Thrip had been in an accident . <p> Now , an hour into the hazy control of classifying , the phone rang . " You 're not recuperating , " Marni Coe said . <p> " I am , too . " <p> " That 's likely . Know what I forgot to tell you ? This woman yesterday blocked me in your driveway . Short hair ? Shoulder pads ? Big gray detective 's car ? " <p> " Never saw her , " Thrip said . He watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one he 'd found on the street and did n't dare eat . <p> " She tried some keys out on your front door and then came after me to see if I lived there . What 's this supposed to mean ? " Marni Coe asked . <p> When Thrip and Marni Coe met two years ago at an improvised Thanksgiving , they argued about anthropology . Marni Coe insisted that romantic love was innate while Thrip claimed it was <p> twelfth-century construction . From the start , he had imagined her as someone capable of nibbling plums in the grocery store without guilt , or opening a few test bags of cookies before deciding to purchase . <p> " You sure you 're okay ? " she asked . <p> " I have no idea , " said Thrip , to both questions . <p> Outside it was still dim , but Thrip felt like squinting . This town remained besieged by clouds so much of the time that you developed the need for sunglasses when it was simply bright and gray . From September to April , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seem nearly normal . Bands wrote songs about it . <p> In the truck , Thrip 's foot slipped on a cluster of dimes before finding the clutch . There had to be at least twenty dollars of change at large in the cab , and Thrip left it that way deliberately , deciding it prudent to allow chaos a corner of its own . Backing out of the press lot , Thrip heard the refracted echo of field drums and a horn line , so he coasted down the wall of the valley , beneath the abandoned Ithaca Guns smokestack , and past the falls . At the high school , Thrip adjusted his sunglasses and climbed the stands until he became slightly dizzy . This appeared to be the final rehearsal before an away football game . Buses idled by the tennis courts , as the band pulled into a tight fist on the far sideline and spun through the first sixty-four bars of the show again and again . At the fifth time through , Thrip decided that there would be a message from Eleanor waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsistent entomologist , had been piling up dissertation data for three months at a field station south of Shreveport . She would drive for five or six days at a time , hunting leaf hoppers ; insects with brains the size of commas , yet smart enough to catch thermals and ride the jet stream straight to Minnesota . She was gracefully tall , freckled , and habitually looking for something  --  a place to eat , better funding , a watch with enough functions  --  yet always in such an indecipherable way that Thrip never understood how the parts could fit into an overriding whole . Her phone messages had become increasingly vague , and now he did not know when she might be back . Two weeks ago her taped and wispy voice reported only that she 'd found a Ziploc bag with a dog 's heart and a condom in it at the edge of <p> state forest . What , Thrip wondered , am I to do with this ? <p> The house on Valentine Place was minute , but reasonable , and Thrip had moved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as roommates and evolved . Thrip initiated it , as that had been his pattern . At first he saw her as intriguing and oddly principled . She was fascinated by folk dancing , pleased that her name belonged to another generation , and refused to wear anything with words on it . In May they 'd had a falling out , " a period of disengagement , " Eleanor said , before she went south . Thrip could n't place what had shifted or how it had moved so quickly . It was akin to working in mist . Long ago he concluded that he was simply not bright at this type of thin  --  B-minus at best . Instead , Thrip held the fort , a task he found much less exasperating alone . Before , he would discover Orange Milanos in the medicine chest , a garlic press behind the plates , unopened beers among the empties when he got to the deposit counter at Tops ; all of which he kept quiet about , deciding that in the future these kinds of problems would simply be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seams . Thrip felt <p> faint warmth and rested his head against the edge of the next row up . He 'd played trombone in high school , and band was as close as he ever got to being on a team . From the field , though , you could never imagine what a show actually looked like . It was always too large . This band kept getting stuck at a long arc with a spiral on the north end , a spot where one side could n't keep up and he music slipped out of phase . The director 's voice sprang from the bullhorn with corrections , and everyone sprinted back to try again . <p> When Thrip woke up , the band and buses were gone . On the soft red track , four people ran hurdles in the rising twilight , weaving from lane to lane . <p> Late Saturday morning , Thrip sat cross-legged on the floor , examining a Matchline ad in the free weekly paper . " Vampire , attractive , 34 , works nights , wants man for fun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was one from : " Operative , seeking aloof , athletic counterpart , indifferent to Communists . " Why was he reading these at all ? Thrip wondered . There were no messages from Louisiana . <p> Thrip 's tongue toured the sockets . The oozing had stopped , but his mouth tasted like chewed yarn . It would take a year for the soft tissue to fill in . He pushed the Weather Channel 's tornado video back into the VCR , and on the screen , the TV crew once again raced a black funnel along a Kansas interstate . At the overpass they sprinted from the van and took shelter up under the girders as the tornado caught up . Every time he saw this , Thrip wondered about the slow car , the one that tumbled from the frame just before the column of wind hit the bridge . Everyone under the girders survived . <p> Marni Coe appeared in his kitchen without knocking . Or maybe she did knock , Thrip thought , and it did n't register . Her dark hair was pulled back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a container of sherbet in the freezer before Thrip could say hello . <p> " You 're progressing , " Marni said , settling into the couch . " Down , I 'd say , from pumpkin head to a squirrel face . " Marni Coe on the raspberry-colored couch . " Am I interrupting anything ? " She looked tired and blamed it on the mockingbird . " It 's a northern mockingbird and it sings every night from eleven to three-thirty , directly below my window . " She waved at the screen . " What is this ? " <p> Thrip explained , as a wall of black sucked up clothes , tricycles , and roofs , ground these together at ten thousand feet , and rained down the parts . He could n't get used to it . A quick and specific swath , a cleaving of past and present . He had even been learning his clouds ; the anvil shape of the nimbus , the difference in altitude and attitude between altocumulus and cirrostratus . Lately he had begun to imagine a future in meteorology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , Thrip made it to the back door . As soon as he opened it , a flushed , middle-aged woman with blunt hair and confident shoes stepped right up on the threshold . <p> " Excuse me , " she said , " but I am showing this house . " She crossed the kitchen as a puzzled older couple wearing tan windbreakers followed in the perfumed slipstream . Thrip looked at his bare feet and noticed that he was n't really dressed , just sweats and a bathrobe . <p> " This house should be empty , " the woman said , giving the seven-foot ceilings a glance of appraisal . She blocked the television screen and dusted smooth the arm of her coral jacket as Marni Coe headed for the bathroom . <p> Thrip tightened the belt on his robe . " Who are you supposed to be ? " he asked . <p> " A real estate agent , " the woman said , " in the midst of a tour . " This was her second try , she explained , and the owner kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She gave Thrip a piercing smile and aimed the frowning couple upstairs . <p> A wall of wind slid across Wichita before the tape shifted to an explanation of the mechanics of tornado formation . Red and yellow spheres rose and spun like chemistry class molecules as Marni Coe emerged from the bathroom . " That was her , " she whispered . " The woman who chased me . " <p> " Why 'd you hide ? " Thrip asked . <p> " I 'm not a confrontation person . " <p> That could n't apply to him , either , Thrip decided , at least not anymore . Some days he was barely a **29;472;TOOLONG sort of person . Footsteps wound through the second floor bedrooms and congregated at the top of the stairs . Thrip heard the words " tiny " and " charm " used in several contexts . As the trio descended , the older man nodded , as if to say , That 's enough . <p> Once they were safely out on the sidewalk , Thrip shouted , " Thanks for stopping by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sentences coming out of his mouth would land . " Look at me . " He plucked his sweats taut . They were maroon , a pair from tenth grade . " I 'm a mess . " <p> " That woman did n't even see you , " Marni Coe said . " You were n't even in the room . " <p> She turned over the Priority Mail pouch on the coffee table . It was addressed for Louisiana and full of postcards , overseas letters , and direct-mail pleas that Thrip could n't get around to forwarding . Marni flipped it back while Thrip tried to explain his landlord situation , in that Mrs. Tibbits actually owned the property , but Gary , her son , managed it . " He 's a hammerhead , " Thrip said , looking for the phone directory on the alphabetized bookshelf . He found last year 's under the VCR , and Mrs. Tibbits answered on the first ring . She would be in the hospital bed that filled her parlor , watching fragments of TV with the remote in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mrs. Tibbits , except that it was chronic . " We 've been visited by a real estate agent , " he told her . <p> " Oh , you two . " Mrs. Tibbits coughed . " Squatters . Squatters so many months in arrears that my son sent the sheriff to have you evicted . " She hung up . Thrip called bad , but Mrs. Tibbits would n't answer . Gary 's number remained busy . <p> " I write the checks , " Thrip said . " I know I do Marni Coe ran the tornado around at double speed . " Why 'd you come over ? " he asked , genuinely perplexed . <p> " To see how you were . " She gave him a quizzical look . " Besides , I needed a walk . We could also drive somewhere . I like driving things the size of your truck . " <p> Thrip discovered his checkbook and showed off a recent rent stub . Marni hummed . Eleanor , before she left , had signed six months ' worth of rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Marni said . " We 're going bowling . " <p> " That 's silly . " <p> " Be a sport . " <p> " I do n't think I can bowl , " Thrip said . <p> She paused the tape . " Anesthesia is fat-soluble . It 's like a curse , which is why you 've got to burn it away . There 's only one way out . You know , that little window at the top of the room ? We might as well get on with it . " <p> Marni Coe drove , and Thrip noticed that she did n't have to readjust the seat . He filed this away as they entered the bowling alley and prepared to rent footwear . <p> " One good thing about bowling is that you get people 's shoe sizes without asking , " Marni said . " You can tell a lot about a person 's personality from their shoe size . " <p> Thrip felt his pockets for quarters . " Yeah , like usually I 'm a nine and a half , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , generally , " Marni said . She paid for both pairs . " You , for instance , tend to exaggerate misfortune . " Thrip thought he should have been annoyed , but she turned away so quickly that he could n't be sure . <p> The bar in the bowling alley was called the Noon Gun Lounge , and initially Thrip saw this as the proper place for their discussion . He had never owned anything with a bullet hole in it . Or even an object that had been shot at . But as they walked toward the lanes , all the distant pin explosions seemed amplified , yet somehow occurring in a different time zone . It was disorienting , so Thrip went to the bathroom and did another dose of codeine . He liked the distance it gave him . However , when he emerged , the bar and the alleys had been overrun by gangs of seven-year-olds embarking on pizza parties . <p> Thrip tried to concentrate on his feet as he laced his shoes up next to Marni Coe . But he kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hand-sized rock into his truck 's rear window , taking out the remaining safety lass and the bullet hole in one dean swipe . To block this away , he began to tell Marni about the condom machine in the men 's room with " Do n't buy this gum . It tastes awful " scrawled across the front . <p> " That is getting pretty standard , " Marni said . She smiled watchfully and investigated the futuristic overhead projector at the scoring island . A second later , she rolled the ten-pound ball with the peanut-butter swirl along the edge of the gutter and did n't even check the two pins ' worth of damage it caused . " Okay , " she said , " bowl your weight . " <p> Thrip had done that once . He 'd rolled a 175 back when he was still holding the ball wrong . He only saw how to use the finger holes correctly two weeks ago from a woman in a car ad holding <p> bright green ball as a prop . The elemental thrill of bowling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocking things over and then getting to do it again . Everyone is enamored by the possibility of repeated perfect events . <p> In the eighth frame , Thrip began to recognize certain pin groupings as distant sets of incisors waiting for rearrangement , so he asked Marni Coe about her work . He only had a thin notion of what she did , but Marni confided that it was not going at all well , which was another reason to be bowling . " Lots of bowling coming up , " she explained . " A windfall of bowling When she was working , Marni Coe created ways to make turf grass grow more slowly , mainly by developing new varieties or applying retardants . " We 're lawn-addicted already , " she told him , " but you save a lot of everything , energy , money , whatnot , if you make it so people ca n't mow all the time . " <p> " And you 're happy with this ? " Thrip asked . <p> " Saving the world through turf grass management ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many blades to an acre ? " <p> " Depends , " Thrip said , feeling sage . <p> " 564,537,600 , " she said . " Average . I win lots of bar bets . Lots . That and most people spend thirty hours a year moving . Almost a week of vacation . See , I 'm lowering stress rates for the future . " She balled up the empty bag of cheese doodles and began a new frame . " Thing is , you 've got to try visualization . " <p> " I do that and they all go down in the wrong lane , " Thrip said . <p> As they climbed Route 13 , away from the lake and past the lone dead car that was always on the shoulder near the crest of the hill , Marni Coe refused to explain where they were headed . " We 're having a caper , " she said amid the open-window rush , as Thrip began to plead . " Did your drugs run out ? " she asked . <p> " No , " Thrip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole ? " Marni acted as though she could n't hear . " The safety glass Thrip gestured , but the stickers were gone . The rear window was whole . He reached back to pat the spot . <p> " It really does n't concern you , " Marni Coe said . " It 's fixed . " She pulled into the driveway of a blue-stained split-level house and backed up to the garage . <p> " I 'm still concerned , " Thrip said . <p> Marni frowned in a way that said , Sorry , pal , too late . " Maybe you just need a new world view . You know , out at Walter 's , there was cat throw-up on this hood and I wiped it off . Just in time . Did you a favor . The acid in it stains your paint . " <p> Thrip felt at once outflanked and apprehended . " Whose house is this ? " <p> " Some friend of Walter 's , " she said . " This guy who designs speakers that biologists use . Sub-woofers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the field . It is neat , but we 're here to steal a bed . Actually , it 's a frame that I found and Walter turned into an issue . He hexed it . " <p> Marni Coe pulled a key ring with a small globe on it from her pocket , yet none of the keys opened the garage . She peered in with her palm against the glass . In the cab , Thrip was preoccupied . He was remembering a time last fall when Gary broke a screwdriver off in their kitchen door while trying to change the locks . Mrs. Tibbits must have given the real estate agent her old keys , ones that never could have worked . Mrs. Tibbits , Thrip realized , had put the house on the market behind Gary 's back . <p> Glenn Thrip reserved Sunday afternoon to deal with Mrs. Tibbits , but on the phone , Marni Coe claimed to have found another set of Walter 's keys . She wanted a new try at the bed . Thrip was just waking up . The skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do both , " Marni said . " You 'll come get me . " And he agreed . <p> Marni 's apartment was the second floor of a bright-aqua , World War I-era house on the flats , near the end of Lake Street . Her ancient and stooped downstairs landlord no longer had a lawn , as he had converted the entire yard to tulip beds . In the truck , Marni asked Thrip if he had a plan , an actual negotiating strategy for Mrs. Tibbits . " It is prudent to rehearse this , " she explained . <p> " I did , " Thrip said , looking cornered , " but there were lots of versions . I kinda got lost . " <p> Mrs. Tibbits 's shingled and once-grand Victorian now sported a satellite dish beside the cupola . The windows on the upper two floors were shuttered , as once Mrs. Tibbits became bedridden the activity of the house collapsed into the front parlor . The license plate of the black Celica in the driveway said BLCELICA . Gary lived just beyond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the front porch intercom . After a pause , which he timed at one minute and forty-three seconds , the lock on the leaded glass door buzzed . The hall smelled of burned toast . The runner to Mrs. Tibbits 's parlor was criss-crossed with blue whorls . <p> " What gall , " Mrs. Tibbits said " The squatters are here , in my house . " Her voice was high , almost girlish . The hospital bed had been cranked up , and she leaned lightly against it , wearing a pale sweater and matching peach slacks . Both hands held a translucent switch which was connected to a wire that ran along the oak baseboards to the front door . " Where are my funds ? " she asked . <p> " Mrs. Tibbits  --  " <p> The buzzer interrupted . Thrip went to check the door until he understood that this was her method of controlling the conversation . " My son reports that you two have refused to pay rent for eight months , " Mrs. Tibbits said . " Eight . I am through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even told the child . " <p> He was suddenly weary , weak-in-the-knees tired . He wanted to sit , but Marni already had the fan chair in the corner . He opened the envelope his bank statement came in and handed Mrs. Tibbits the canceled rent checks . She turned the first three over to examine her son 's endorsement . " Could these be fakes ? " she asked . <p> Thrip shook his head . Mrs. Tibbits set the checks on the bed as Thrip replaced them with a stack of copies . " I believe our lease is still in effect , " he said , not realizing until later how ludicrous and lawyer-like it sounded . <p> Mrs. Tibbits waved vaguely . " Be gone , " she said , crumpling a tissue . " I will discuss this . " <p> Freeing the bed turned out to be disarmingly easy , given the right set of keys . As they drove up East Hill , Marni explained that Walter 's friend , Peyton , who owned the blue-gray house and lived alone , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed itself turned out to be a maple , nineteenth-century beast of a thing . It came with sleigh ends , scalloped rails , and a freezer bag of hardware . When Thrip tried to help load the parts , Marni shooed him upstairs . " There 's cool stuff on the walls , " she said . " Wavy pastel landscapes . " <p> In the living room , Thrip ignored the tinted and manipulated photographs and investigated Peyton 's vast collection of small plastic figures . The bookshelves had been converted to dioramas . Dinosaurs battled Teutonic knights . A Redcoat waited to ambush an ambulance driving wizard . Napoleon went hand to hand with Richard Petty . <p> The garage door closed , and Thrip heard his truck start . The bed was roped in and veiled with a blue plastic drop cloth . It seemed to take no time at all . <p> Under pressure , Thrip could recognize a pattern , so as Marni Coe drove downtown , he acted as though destinations no longer mattered . He enjoyed watching her drive . He liked gliding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon Thrip found himself behind the front window of a bar , in a chair with a loose leg and using both hands to clasp a bottle of Rolling Rock . The sky had darkened with astonishing speed , and the orange streetlights in front of Woolworth 's sparked to life . Incoming cumulonimbus , Thrip decided . <p> Marni Coe landed a basket of golden popcorn at his elbow . " This is death to my sockets , " Thrip said . " Parts 'll get stuck . My face 'll blow up . " <p> " Ca n't have that . " She moved the basket to the table behind her . <p> " How involved are you and Walter ? " Thrip asked . The words jutted out . <p> " Past or present ? " Marni did n't even look surprised . " Pretty much , until recently . I mean , we were kinda everywhere . " She retrieved the popcorn , and Thrip took some , anyway . He attempted to guide the sharp parts toward the roof of his mouth . " See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Marni explained . " Really . I mean , he spends a lot of time lately worrying about what he 's eating or how he 's getting out of bed . Putting spells on viruses . He was forever a project but  --  I do n't know . There 's some reason I ca n't have this bed , only I 'm not sure what it is . We 're in mid-drift . " <p> " Who started it ? " <p> " I did . " Marni Coe crossed her legs . Two one-way streets met at the corner beyond the glass . " I love this seat , " she said . " It 's bad-idea central . Traffic-violation city . Once an hour , minimum . " <p> Thrip watched with drowsy surprise as the black Celica , the one with the purple undercarriage sheen , made an illegal left-hand turn and headed the wrong way up Cayuga Street . " Jesus , " Thrip said . " That 's Gary . " The license plate matched . " Man oh man , is he going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows ? " Marni said . " I mean , that his cash cow 's on the market ? " <p> Thrip shook his head . " Gary 's one of those people who decides you can put purple lights under your car and just become somebody else . Like you can get away with anything . You 've got forcefield protection . " <p> " Nothing wrong with the concept , " Marni Coe said . " It could be that simple . " This she said almost to herself . " Could n't Gary have raised your rent , not told his mom , and skimmed off the top ? " <p> " Maybe . " Thrip nearly laughed , but it stopped halfway up . " The boy 's just missing that overarching view . " Yet as he said the words , Thrip noticed a shift , a peculiar change in pressure . How he had arrived here , late in the afternoon in this precarious chair , right before the rain ? He was not at all comfortable with the question . <p> " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Marni Coe said . She draped her hand at the back of Thrip 's chair and smiled into the middle distance . " It 's pretty . And you 're holding up how ? " <p> The entire neighborhood was in a fog when Thrip left Marni Coe 's apartment early the next morning . The streetlights had chilly halos , and Fred Lively , her landlord , was out searching for unraked leaves . " How 'd you like that blue jay last night ? " he asked . The rake was painted to match the house . <p> " Fine , " Thrip said , though he did n't understand what Fred Lively was talking about . Thrip zipped up the too-large motorcycle jacket he 'd found on a chair in Marni 's kitchen . His thoughts were spongy . The world sounded like a tape with extra vibrato . Driving appeared impossible , so Thrip left the truck in front of Marni 's house . She already had a key . She must have , he thought , or she would n't have been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill made Thrip 's sockets pulse . The blood vessels felt too close to the surface , and he worried about his dots . He did n't want them to break . Yet as the fog brightened , Thrip understood that down below , on the porch , Fred Lively had meant the mockingbird . " Is n't that a stupid blue jay ? " someone had shouted last night on the street , just after a bar on the corner had closed . " No , it can do a blue jay , but it 's not a blue jay the other voice explained . As Thrip drifted off , the bird began mimicking a distant car alarm . " Trwiip . Dwiip . Trwiip . Dwiip . Trwiip . " Thrip had to work to ignore it . <p> At the higher plain of Stewart Avenue , Thrip discovered an expanse of light blue sky . The fog was in fact only a large cloud crowded into the valley . You could walk across the top . He granted himself permission to disregard work and head toward home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fall . Thrip woke late that afternoon , but in his dream the oral surgeon had exclaimed , " We have to go back There 's more to take " Even if that turned out to be true , Thrip reasoned , at least now he 'd know what to expect . He took a bracing dose of codeine and counted the remaining pills while listening to a phone message from Mrs. Tibbits 's daughter . It explained that all future rent checks should be made out to Mrs. Joyce Chaning , Gary 's sister , and sent to an address in Corning . <p> Marni Coe appeared with the truck around dinnertime . She wore her green-checked flannel shirt like a jacket and under that a black top that said MAD MAX in letters that looked homemade . " Salvation Army , " she explained . " You knew I made a truck key ? " <p> " Guessed , " Thrip said . Invasive procedure or invasive personality ? The phrase came from his dream . <p> " What if I lost yours ? " Marni said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't sure . You 're more difficult that way than what I 'm used to . " Marni pointed to the bowl of mashed potatoes in Thrip 's palm . " Those you can bring in the truck , " she said . " You 'll want Walter 's jacket , too . It might be cool later . " <p> Going past the airport , in a direction that seemed to spell Cortland , Thrip said , " If this is contra dancing I 'm getting out now . " Over the years he had developed a deep fear of contra dancing . Usually this event happened at some VFW with quilts on the walls , and as soon as Thrip caught on , they changed the moves , leaving him terminally on the wrong foot and propelled from hand to musty hand . " Like being on a midway ride gone wild , " he explained . " Your face gets sucked back by unbearable G-forces . " <p> Marni Coe had a deep and musical laugh . She turned on the tape deck . It came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be Sedated . " From her shirt pocket , she handed Thrip a crisply rolled joint . <p> " Another oldie . " He punched in the cigarette lighter and wondered aloud how much longer those would still be in cars . " Want some ? " <p> " Got ta drive , " she said . <p> " That 's admirable . " A lavender motorcycle helmet rolled around in the truck bed behind him . They passed a drive-in which had succumbed to life as a mobile home dealership . Blue spruce climbed to conceal the screen . Thrip rubbed his eyes and lost track of where they were . Marni Coe , he saw , wore a friendship bracelet on her right wrist woven from brilliant tropical-colored threads . <p> " You still want to know what it was ? " she asked . <p> " Sure , " he said , not certain what the question referred to . <p> " A pellet gun , " Marni said . " I did it . Walter left it loaded . I had it in the front seat sticking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out your rear window . " <p> The various greens and golds making up the fields appeared to expand . Thrip could barely imagine the things he might have said , even as recently as last week . The words swelled like an impressive wave that would never make it to the beach . How could it not matter ? he thought . A bullet hole ? But the reflected sun kept coming at him from the rearview mirror . He tried instead to look ahead , past the vibrating pastures at the sides of his vision , to a spot where the landscape was still in miniature . <p> Several oiled roads later , on top of a hill overlooking Route 81 and across from the Blodgett Mills Gun Club , the Skyway Raceway sat fenced and surrounded by a freshly carved ravel parking lot . It was a low-banked dirt track : five eighths of a mile , two turns , and an infield of puddles . The blue and white numbers by the pit area were painted to match the stands . A stake-bed pickup , driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circled as the heavy woman in back wielded a wand , dampening down the dust . <p> Marni eased in to park among the Blazers and station wagons . She paid the five-dollar cover and tossed the motorcycle helmet into the cab . " I 'll put us in the family section , so no one 'll mess with you , " she said . Only six-packs were allowed in the family section , according to the sin . <p> A race had just started . The cars looked normal enough from a distance , aside from the roll bars , the wire mesh on the windows where the safety glass had been , and the hand-painted ads for siding companies and bakeries on their doors . The noise rose up to Thrip as the unmuffled roar of throaty mammoths . When they reached the family section , Marni Coe checked her watch . " Will you be okay for a while ? " she asked . Marni went to wander , as Thrip grew accustomed to the question . <p> Alone , things became dear in a way that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several senses . Decisions had actually been made months ago . Thrip now knew that . He could think of this dismantling as his idea , but it was in fact a favor from Eleanor . He was only now catching up , and embarrassed by the bits of wrongly imagined future , he had carried along . <p> At a quarter to eight the lights came on . The white-haired woman beside Thrip in the Agway jacket yawned , and a small bug flew into her mouth . " That about sums up my day , " she said . The announcer ordered all Spectator Race contestants to bring their release forms and helmets to the start-finish line . Thrip wondered where Marni Coe was , exactly . <p> When the three cars and the lone white truck lined up two across for the first heat of the Spectator Race , Thrip understood . These were the cars people had arrived in . They were the vehicles they drove to work . His pickup had the inside slot on the second row . Marni Coe , wearing the lavender helmet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civic . <p> " They 're here to have their hearts stopped , " said the loudspeaker . " And you , in your heart of hearts , know you could be out there , too . " <p> Three laps . The crowd thought this was hilarious . Racing with repair consequences . It was a monthly event . " Next week it 's trailer races , " the woman beside him explained . " They tow pop-up campers and things . Snowmobile trailers . " <p> " That 's my truck , " Thrip told her . " The white one . " <p> The woman turned to appraise him from a different angle and patted his knee . " Good for you , " she said , as if he had finally begun to branch out . " Good for you . " <p> Thrip 's truck spewed clumps of mud through the long corners . It might have been a loud mural , set in motion against the deep forest . Marni Coe passed the Civic , and her back wheels made an elegant sideways hop into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . He had been chosen . He saw that this might not be a compliment , but that turned into a choice the moment you could recognize it . He was supposed to be unnerved . That was the underlying game here . <p> The Cadillac held the lead until it blew a tire at the finish and slid across the line behind the Civic . A kind of happy pandemonium rolled through the stands . Marni came in third . She grinned and pounded the steering wheel . The woman beside Thrip hooted and said that next he 'd have to worry about finding a pit crew . <p> As the crowd stood , Thrip gave in to examining the clouds . Altocumulus in solid regular rolls . A middle-level line of tubes over a magenta sky . Moisture masses heaped and headed in one direction , only to be cut by vertical currents of unstable air . It felt like acting , all of this , here in the family section of the Skyway Raceway . He bean to wonder if on a certain level the mechanism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that simple . With a release of pressure , events would always swirl in to fill a space . <p> When Glenn Thrip could see the track again , the woman and the boy with the tank truck were spraying it down for the next heat . Thrip followed the white roof of his pickup into the dotted parking lot and watched as Marni , still laughing , backed into an empty space . There was nothing to stop this from continuing . <p>
