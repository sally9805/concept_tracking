Populism and Louisiana 's ghosts <p> David Duke chats with supporters and reporters on the oak-shaded lawn of the antebellum courthouse in Clinton , Louisiana . This is not a rally but a handshaking stop of rural parishes during the primary campaign . Aside from the gap-toothed biker with the long beard and the intense , thin-mustached gentleman with the American flag on his sleeve , Duke 's supporters appear to be the conservative , small-town , working-class citizens who generally attend his rallies . Then , as Duke speaks , a middle-aged woman in a turquoise dress whispers : " Well , he certainly is the most handsome candidate . " When Duke turns to enter the courthouse , she approaches and extends her hand , drawling , " Why , yes , Captain Butler , I remember you . " She takes a ring from her finger and presses it into his hand . UI want to make a contribution to your campaign . This is worth about $100 . " The woman turns and sashays off , and Duke , after staring dumbfounded at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ma'am , ma'am , I do n't think the Campaign Finance Law will allow me to accept this . Now if you 'd like to write a check to the campaign . " <p> In his unsuccessful bid for re-election this year , Louisiana Governor Buddy Roemer relied heavily on television commercials that bore the tag line : " We ca n't turn back the clock . " He had it all wrong . In this state the past , whether in the form of Rhett Butler or otherwise , is always near at hand . Louisiana 's clock , which never kept good time to start with , broke sometime in the 1980s when the oil money dwindled and the excessive , corrupt hayride it fueled crashed and burned . The current gubernatorial runoff between David Duke and Edwin Edwards centers not on shaping the future but on digging up the past in search of , if nothing else , someone to blame . <p> Both lay claim to Huey Long 's ghost . The flamboyant , silver-tongued Edwards expanded on Long 's vision of spending free-flowing oil revenues on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patronage to his friends . The oil-bust depression and two subsequent federal trials , however , ( including testimony that Edwards paid off Las Vegas collectors with $500,000 in cash stuffed in suitcases ) alienated Edwards from the white , working-class end of his base . Until then he 'd admitted - even joked about - his gambling and womanizing . But after the trials , the stigma of the high roller and competent crook remained , even though Edwards was eventually acquitted of all charges . <p> In 1987 many of those white , rural Democrats-who had supported Edwards and whose parents had supported Long - turned to the angry agenda of Harvard-educated Representative Buddy Roemer , a former political consultant from rural northwest Louisiana , to cure the excess and corruption of government grown too big . " I love Louisiana , " he told campaign audiences , " but I hate Louisiana politics . " Like George Bush , Roemer ran from the right but then tried to move his Reaganite revolution to the center to find the real solutions to Louisiana 's massive problems . Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense to hold the center and the right . After the legislature dealt him some bruising setbacks and his second wife left him , Roemer turned to the self-help readings of Robert Fulghum and emerged less interested in the chase of politics . Gone was the zealous , butt-kicking , maverick campaigner . Gone also was his appeal to Huey 's old populist flock . Buddy let go of the reins of anger that drove his revolution , and David Duke was there to seize them . <p> When Duke ran for state representative in 1989 , he exchanged his white power spiel for more moderate Reaganism , laced with concern for " our Christian European heritage , " He broadened the Reagan brand of conservative populism to include opposition to free trade , especially the recent trade agreement with Mexico . Though a conservative , Duke appeals to many of the children and grandchildren of Long 's old populist constituency . Except that today the scapegoats have changed : the rich man is replaced by the welfare cheat , big business by big government . When he announced for governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Huey Long . But we need a Huey in reverse , someone from outside the system to bring it back under control . " <p> Duke spent the summer in the countryside , away from the media centers , retracing his steps from his 1990 Senate campaign . His rallies and barbecues attracted big crowds in burgs most statewide candidates never saw : Goldanna , Marthaville , Vivian , Bordelonville , Holly Beach . By the time Roemer made one of his first campaign stops , at the Pickin ' and Ginnin ' Festival in the cotton town of Rayville , Duke was there to greet him . <p> " Welcome to Duke Country , governor . " <p> " Thanks , Dave , I thought this was Louisiana . " <p> " Louisiana is Duke Country , governor . " <p> A photographer asked for a picture and captured their frozen smiles . Over the photographer 's shoulder , Roemer could see what Duke was talking about . One out of four festival-goers clogging the main drag wore blue Duke stickers or carried Duke placards . The governor walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting with business supporters at the local bank . Duke stood by his campaign booth and the people flocked to him , treating him more like a celebrity than a candidate . " I like what you stand for , " said a young woman with Duke-stickered children in tow . " We 're all for you down at the gin , " said the sunburned cotton farmer <p> By fall the rallies moved to the cities and grew larger and more middle class , as computer programmers and nurses joined the ranks of welders and waitresses . " Duke 's vote did n't surge in the end , " said unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate Sam Jones . " It surfaced . " Though it did n't show up in the opinion polls , the Duke vote was there all along , as it was in 1990 when he received 43.5 percent of the vote against U.S. Senator J. Bennett Johnston . Then his showing was attributed to his supporters ' fears of unemployment and resentment against federal welfare and affirmative action programs . Voting for Duke was seen as sending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same issues would play in the race for governor , with its executive responsibility for a $9 billion budget and management of 75,000 employees . <p> But by the summer of 1991 Duke 's heated rhetoric began filling the vacuum on the right created by the idling Roemer . Duke pushes the same buttons Ronald Reagan did , just as expertly . Like Reagan , he understands the power of the anecdote that oversimplifies a problem and foils any attempt to put it in proportion . Never mind that food stamps is a federal program and that Louisiana 's share of welfare payments is one of the stingiest in the nation . Or that Governor Roemer passed a strong workfare bill ( and that Representative Duke voted against it ) . When Duke talks about " people on food stamps who buy hamburger while you 're buying Hamburger Helper and then use their welfare checks to buy alcohol or lottery tickets , " the crowds roar their affirmation . As with any anecdote , the sympathetic listener only has to have seen the same thing once to accept the generalization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder to shoulder , and that proximity does not always foster understanding . <p> Duke 's claims went unanswered because Roemer , far ahead of Duke in the polls until the very end , did not want to acknowledge the challenger 's issues - Reagan 's issues . Duke made the most of his free ride . At every stop he resurrected the retired schoolteacher living on a $378-a-month pension Vho ca n't afford to turn on her air-conditioner while prisoners - murderers and rapists - have central air , heat , and color TV . " <p> There is no out-Duking Duke . When Roemer aired a television commercial boasting of executing five convicted murderers , Duke countered : The problem is there have been over 2,000 murders in the last four years and that wo n't go down until we start executing more than five . " And the story that always provokes a cheer or a chill , depending on the listener : Duke tells of a constituent who was accosted by thugs in her Metairie shop . By the time the police answered her 911 call , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone receiver . " The officers grabbed them and threw them against the wall and said , ' Are you guys crazy ? Do n't you know this is David Duke 's district ? ' Ladies and gentlemen , wo n't it be great when every law enforcement officer in Louisiana can say the same thing ? " <p> Duke 's bond with his audiences immunizes him against his past . Ask a supporter about Duke 's Klan and Nazi activities and the typical response is : " Everyone has a past . " A pipeline engineer says , " There are things in my past that I 'm not proud of . " A retired veteran from rural north Louisiana is not bothered by Duke 's Klan membership : " Years ago my father and my grandfather all belonged to secret organizations . The KKK was just one of them . " An LSU student at a Duke rally in Baton Rouge says , Tm a Christian and I believe you can change . Three years ago I was lost on alcohol and drugs and I 've changed , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rice Festival parade route in Edwards 's Cajun hometown of Crowley says , " There are too many people looking at him . If they could prove he was a Nazi , which I doubt , they would have done it by now . " <p> By late in the primary campaign , the more that recent anti-Semitic statements were attributed to Duke , the greater the resentment built against the messenger , the press . " The press never mentions David without calling him a Ku Klux Klan wizard and a Nazi in the first sentence , " said a New Orleans woman . They do n't say Edwards was indicted every time they mention him . " In a way the local and national press coverage of Duke 's past , the documentation of his Klan and Nazi activities , even the condemnation by President George Bush , seem to strengthen the bonds between Duke and his followers , When Duke is attacked , they feel they are being attacked . " He said he 's sorry . What more do you want ? " said a mechanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accustomed to being disparaged for their laissez-faire politics , show wider tolerance for rogue mavericks , from the eighteenth-century pirate Jean Lafitte to modern-day pirates Huey Long and Edwin Edwards . David Duke , the Most Politically Incorrect Man in America , qualifies for that club . <p> Duke 's past obviously does not bother the 491,000 voters who backed him in the open primary , just 32,000 fewer than the front-runner , Edwards . But what of the 410,000 Roemer voters and the 130,000 for the other candidates ? For the most part Roemer voters are college-educated city-dwellers who generally abhor Duke 's past more than they do his current conservative views . But Duke has an antidote : Edwards 's past and the hard-core " anyone-but-Edwin " vote . In 1983 many current Roemer voters were part of Edwards 's 64 percent majority against Republican incumbent Dave Treen . Yet shortly after Edwards took office , unpopular tax increases and the federal indictments , combined with the disintegrating economy , turned those middle-class voters hard against him . " I 'll cut off my right arm before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dentist . Now the dentist has a problem . <p> Edwin Edwards started the day after the primary to fashion this most unlikely winning coalition . After he promised not to scrap Roemer 's major reforms , the state 's major newspapers and business leaders recognized little choice but to endorse their old nemesis Edwards . So did environmentalists , moderate Republicans , and women 's groups once loyal to Roemer . Even Roemer , in his characteristic tortured style , said he could vote for , though not endorse , Edwards . Jewish businessmen began the morning after the primary raising hundreds of thousands of dollars in Louisiana and around the country . Maurice " Hippo " Katz of New Orleans declared : " David Duke thinks he hates Jews now . Wait till we 're Finished with him . " Edwards is basking in the establishment 's embrace and promises to make the best of " this great opportunity " not only to pull the state together but " to prove to you that I can be a great governor . " At 64 , he says he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But many of the conservative voters who will decide this campaign remain convinced that Edwards is more competent than sincere . " As I see it , if Duke wins he 'll only last four years and wo n't get anything done , " says a Baton Rouge homemaker and Roemer voter . " If Edwards gets in , he 's in for eight and it will take years after that to get out of the hole he put us in . " For cynical voters , Duke at his worst will be merely ineffective , while Edwards at his worst will be all too effective . <p> Business leaders are warning that Duke 's election would mean economic devastation for a state struggling out of bad times . Several large associations have informed New Orleans tourism officials that they will pull their big national conventions from the city if Duke is elected . Some industrialists say Louisiana would be all but redlined from future plant expansions . That argument will be pounded home by election day , but perhaps with mixed results . Convention tourism is principally a New Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city do not travel far upriver . Most other state industries are based on natural resources - and are not easily moved . Beyond that , employers fear they carry little influence with their workers ' votes , many of whom cheer Duke 's opposition to affirmative action . Finally , the more dire the economic warning , the more likely that workers will feel they are being dared to vote for Duke . Never dare the voter . <p> Edwards says he will not make the mistake of directly attacking Duke and his past , though third-party groups are coming out with ads exposing Duke 's false claims of military service and his anti-Semitic statements , including his stated beliefs that the gas chambers of the Holocaust actually were used for delousing . One group , the Coalition Against Racism and Nazism , ran a full-page ad in the New Orleans Times Picayune showing before-and-after plastic surgery photos of Duke below the headline : SOME CHANGE is ONLY SKIN DEEP . The paper 's profile of Duke recounted some of the more bizarre incidents from his past , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overthrow the government of the island of Dominica ( Duke later took the Fifth Amendment before a federal grand jury ) ; his celebration , according to friends , of Hitler 's birthday until recently ; and his authorship , under pen names , of an urban guerrilla manual for black militants and of a soft-porn sex manual for women . But even this help from the press and others leaves Edwards , the veteran attack campaigner , with a problem : he ca n't attack Duke 's record in government because he hardly has one ; and he ca n't attack Duke 's positions on issues because they are Reagan 's issues , and thus fairly popular with the swing Roemer voter . <p> Duke has no such problem . He immediately opened up on Edwards 's past record of lax increases , environmental neglect , and cronyism . He charges that Edwards is out selling every Cabinet and board position , " some three and four times , " though Edwards challenges him to name one instance . At the end of the statewide televised debate last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said Edwards " sold or gave away . " <p> Edwards predicts a comfortable margin of victory , but the polls are n't promising . The first poll after the primary showed him with a 46 percent to 42 percent lead , with 12 percent undecided ( 10 percent white , 2 percent black ) . Of the undecided , 58 percent said they thought Duke was more honest ; 5 percent said the same for Edwards . It is the highest that Duke , who always underpolls , has ever polled . In the Mason-Dixon poll . Duke had 58 percent of the white vote to Edwards 's 28 percent , while Edwards had 93 percent of the blacks with the rest undecided . <p> Just making the runoff is an important victory for Duke 's suddenly rocketing political career . Though he would clearly relish winning , a close second may serve him almost as well . Several congressional districts in Louisiana would make inviting targets in 1992 . Also , the timing is natural to enter the spring presidential primaries to take his message national and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual contributors in this race live outside Louisiana ) . By 1996 he could be the best-known Republican presidential candidate next to Dan Quayle , with a popular message , universal name recognition , and his past even further behind him . Like Huey Long , David Duke is a candidate for hard times . If the national economy is as bad in 1996 as Louisiana 's is now , the Republicans ' worst mistake would be to underestimate him . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : DRAWING BY VINT LAWRENCE FOR THE NEW REPUBLIC <p> <p> By John Maginnis <p> <p> JOHN MAGINNIS , author of a book about Edwin Edwards , The Last Hayride ( Gris Gris Press , 1984 ) , is writing a book about the 1991 Louisiana election . <p>
