<p> To the Editor : <p> " P.R . Firms Head to Capitol Hill " ( Business Day , Jan. 4 ) contains one specific error of fact and a more serious misinterpretation of public relations history . <p> Error of fact : When Edward L. Bernays opened his publicity office in a remodeled house at 19 East 48th Street in New York City in the summer of 1919 , his was the eighth such agency , not the first . Bernays saw the possibility of this new vocation while he and Carl Byoir were conducting a campaign to win United States recognition of Lithuania 's independence . ( Byoir would not come back to public relations until 1930 . ) <p> The country 's first publicity agency was the Publicity Bureau , established in Boston in 1900 by three former newspapermen , George V. S. Michaelis , Thomas Marvin and Herbert Small " to do a general press agent business . " Its early clients were Charles W. Eliot of Harvard , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the American Telephone Company , then in Boston . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The second agency , clearly a response to the mounting attacks on big business on Capitol Hill , was started by William Wolf Smith , who left his job as a reporter for The New York Sun in 1902 " to do a publicity business . " Wolf saw the need for corporations to have help against attacks in the press and by regulatory bills . <p> The third agency , Parker &; Lee , was formed late in 1904 by George Parker , who had served as President Grover Cleveland 's press agent in his three campaigns for the Presidency , and was engaged to direct the Democrats ' 1904 campaign . Parker hired Ivy Lee to assist him because he saw in Lee " a lively writer . " Lee had quit his job as a New York reporter in 1903 because of " the low pay " and having to get home at 2 A.M. <p> Thus the use of public relations to influence legislation and regulation in government is nothing new . It had its genesis in the Progressive era of political revolt and reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public by railroads , corporations and financiers came to be reflected in President Theodore Roosevelt 's Square Deal and his trust-busting efforts . The first instinct of capitalists under attack was to rely on their lawyers to fix things and their advertising agents to stem press attacks . These tactics did n't work . <p> Foresighted financiers and public relations practitioners saw that big business could no longer rely on lawyers to stem the tide with pressures , campaign contributions and occasional bribes . Among these were the financial mogul J. P. Morgan , who chose Judge Elbert H. Gary to head off criticism of his new massive United States Steel and brought Theodore N. Vail back to American Telephone &; Telegraph to repair and redeem its deteriorating situation . Another was Ivy Lee , who quit Parker &; Lee to go work for the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1908 as its first publicity director . <p> This basic shift from sole reliance on lobbying to influence legislation and regulation can be seen in the history of the railroads of the early 1900 's . In 1906 the railroads employed the Publicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a futile effort to head off Roosevelt 's railroad reform legislation , the Hepburn Act . Roosevelt 's skillful use of the press and the stump carried the day . In 1910 the Eastern railroads again relied on their lawyers to win a 5 percent freight increase . Again to no avail . <p> When Ivy Lee returned to the Pennsylvania , after a two-year leave in London , he argued that he should work on the policy level and was made an executive assistant , the first public relations person moved to the policy-making level . Lee persuaded the railroads to mount a campaign to win public support for the rate increase . The executives agreed they had failed because they had not told their story to the public . <p> Lee argued : " If you go to the people and get the people to agree with you , you can be sure that ultimately legislatures , commissions and everybody else must give way in your favor . " Lee 's campaign won the freight increase in 1914 . Shortly thereafter he went to work for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of linking public relations with legislative relations to gain governmental favors . <p> Ivy Lee saw corporate lawyers as the problem , not the solution : " I have seen more situations which the public ought to understand and which the public would sympathize with , spoiled by the intervention of a lawyer than in any other way . Whenever the lawyer starts to talk to the public , he shuts out the light . " <p> This conflict between the legal counsel and public relations counsel continues to this day , often to the detriment of the institution , for example , Exxon 's handling of the Valdez disaster .
