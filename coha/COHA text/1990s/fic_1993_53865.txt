I 'll tell you what I know . Although my name is in that wonderful program  --  " Melissa Halliday " is me , right there under " Principals "  --  I know myself enough to know that my shining moment was a mistake , which is okay since my mother taught me self-respect , my father taught me common sense , and living with my brother has put the fear of God into me about being stupid . I 'm only sixteen , but I know all about this cut-throat business I 'm in ; it 's hard , especially for a girl , and especially for a black girl with not enough ambition . I learned that from Caitlin , right before she got her wish to get out of Philadelphia and disappeared back to New York . I know I 'm only a good dancer , not great , not even really good . I know I would n't have gotten the chance without her , without that messed-up thing she did to get me my moment in the sun . <p> And although I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what else I know about it . <p> It 's a boiling July Saturday afternoon when me and Caitlin are sitting out on the nasty old brown carpet in the hallway downstairs at Philidance , right underneath that poster with the quote  --  I do n't know who said it  --  " Those who dance are thought mad by those who hear not the music . " I 've always thought it was corny , but a lot of girls like it . Anyway , we 're sweating half to death since the company 's too damn cheap to turn on the air conditioning except a little bit in the dance studios . As usual , the other girls have gone to the diner across the street where the air is on , but me and Caitlin are in the hot seat , ordered to stay close-by ; besides , Philidance is pretty cliquey and Caitlin does n't get along with people so well . <p> " Only in this ass-backward , white-bread Philadelphia , " Caitlin growls , so pissed off , in her put-on old lady voice like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all get shoved out of rehearsal because Little Miss Diva ca n't hack it anti starts bawling like a baby on Meredith 's shoulder . At Ailey  --  " <p> " I know , Caitlin , " I say . " I know all about you and Alvin Ailey . " <p> Caitlin 's all hunched over yanking off a toenail with her teeth , and she 's grumbling things like " Ai n't nothing but politics when a whiny , no-talent , arhythmic , billboard-assed , limp little bitch of a bunhead blimp like that takes my solo , " and although I do n't agree I whistle , marveling how ferociously she can jam on insults when she does n't like someone . I do n't get involved , except I can sort of see her point , so I say , " Hmm . " <p> She pops her toe out of her lips and spits a flake across the hallway . " That all you can ever say is ' Hmm ' ? " <p> " No , " I say , not about to get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . She just rolls her big green eyes , takes her foot fiat in both hands like a piece a Wonder Bread , shoves it back in again , and mumbles with a mouthful of foot , " Gedit y'own dan self ! " So I go into her dance bag and shove aside her sweaty garbage , and I see inside she 's got a nine-pack of rubbers , which I hold up to her . <p> Still chewing , she says , " Least I got a use for them . " I think , Yeah , at least she 's got a use for them , but I only say , " With all them bobby pins and junk in your bag , they 've got holes in them anyway . " She looks at me funny for a second , then breaks up chuckling when I put the butt between my lips and try to flick my empty Bic . <p> " Damn , girl , gim me that ! Do n't you know how to suck ? ' Course not , you nasty old clam-licking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rips the butt away , pops it in her lush lips , and bugs her eyes out crazily , making sex sounds . I laugh and laugh , and we fall all over each other acting giddy and I just love her . Even the way she always talks like a construction worker  --  I mean , " bitch " and " nigger " and " faggot " and " douche bag " are her greatest terms of endearment  --  but I just chalk that up to her being from New York . She 's older than me , almost seventeen , and I just imagine she must have seen some things . Besides , I like her rough edges . They keep her from being too perfect . <p> Do n't think that I worshipped her , though ; we disagreed on lots of things . For one , I 'm a ballerina of sorts , and Caitlin thought ballet the wimpiest form of dance ever invented . For another , she had a nearly insane paranoia about lesbians , so strong it made you wonder . Well , okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I suppose that 's what really got her in trouble from day one , mouthing off about it in front of Meredith , the ballet teacher  --  " clam lickers " this and " muff divers " that . This certainly did n't win Caitlin many friends here . She never explained it , but my theory is it 's something to do with her mother . They do n't have the best relationship , and Caitlin sometimes mentioned her mom 's " friends , " and I never heard her say one word about her dad . I always would tell her she picked the wrong profession then , but she would n't hear it . When she kidded me about being one , I would say , " Unlike you , Caitlin , I am not a natural dancer , my parents are not rich , I go to school still , and I work at waitressing to pay for classes and have no time or energy for any social life at all . So how do you suppose I manage to be gay ? Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frankly in no hurry . " She would tease me but that 's all , saying , " Philadelphian , virgin  --  same thing . " <p> So , while rolling around on each other laughing , we hear Miss Diva let out a wail inside the studio , and Caitlin becomes all serious again and picks herself off of me . " Damn , " she says , pulling down her wiry , burnt sienna  --  colored hair , " we 're gon na be waiting here for hours . " She holds the lit cigarette out to me . I do n't say , " It 's your own fault , " but instead I try to cheer her up . <p> " I 'm not smoking that , " I say , " with your spit and toe-jam all over it . " <p> She just huffs , pulls up her knees to her chest , and knocks her head back against the wall . We listen to her competitor crying inside for a while . Caitlin looks to the ceiling , French-inhales , and blows a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her eyes are almost Asian-shaped , olive-green grooved with brown flecks like the underside of a mushroom . She looks dignified and sad , but I do n't think she 's sorry . <p> " Please stop gawking at me , Trina , " she says . While my name is Melissa , that 's Mel , " Trina " is short for " Ballet-Katrina , " which is another name like " bunhead " that the modern dancers call people like me and Miss Diva . <p> " I ca n't help it , " I admit . I tell her yet again I think she 's the most beautiful dancer in class . When she says which class , I say , " Modern , jazz , and ethnic . " <p> It 's not that she ca n't be a beautiful ballerina , too , if she wanted , it 's just that she does n't want to ; she 's got fantastic technique , God-given lines , perfect extension , and strong arches , but she thinks ballet 's boring . She lifts weights and is lean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has a woman 's body already  --  her breasts are not bumps , and there 's no mistaking her from behind for a little boy . But she has no weight problem and can eat whatever she wants , and I sometimes hate her for that . And it 's true that Caitlin should easily be a soloist at least in the second company ; and I suppose it 's also true that Miss Diva is slightly baby-fatty and ugly and only got the role because she 's tall and the token white girl in our section and cries like nobody 's business . <p> And so I 'm watching gorgeous Caitlin blow smoke rings , and working myself up to being outraged on her behalf , when the door to the studio opens and Meredith steps out into the hall followed by a sniffling Miss Diva , who 's rubbing her knee where she fell on it when Caitlin tripped her . Meredith is a Trina-type , and her one eyebrow is slanted into a furious V as she glares down at me and says , " You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caitlin . " You , " she says , pointing , steaming , then giving up , " just you better be in my office in five minutes , girl . " Caitlin blows out a billow of smoke and shrugs ; I think this is no time for her to be defiant . Then , I know it 's also true that Caitlin is just a plain big mouth with too much attitude , which is what landed us out here in the hall in the first place and ensured that she would never get her solo at this company . <p> I look over at Julianna  --  to give Miss Diva her real name  --  and see her face flushed like pink lemonade , her eyelids swollen , her forehead all pimply from using too much hairspray to mat her hair back , her clavicle bones protruding , her thin chapped lips quivering . I 'm thinking , She 's what they want , the kind of ballerina people like the old folks at the Academy of Music will pay money to see . I 'm thinking , Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Swan . But I 'm also thinking what a bloodthirsty business I 'm in , and almost feel lucky that I 'll probably never get beyond the corps or maybe a Sugar Plum Fairy . Almost lucky . <p> I eye Julianna and think she could use a little paint on her face . " Ug-leeeee ! " is how Caitlin put it once , going off on the new girl with an old Moms routine . " Her face is sooo ugly , chile , honest to goodness it hurts my feelings ! " An exaggeration , I think , but then Julianna does look so sickly : always talks soft like she ca n't breathe , holds her head or stomach like she 's carrying around a whopping migraine or constant cramps . She 's thin enough to wear that pink leotard and those shrinkwrapped Levi 's , but her skin is soft and puffy like a child 's , making her look fatter than she is . As I 've seen her do so many times before , Julianna nervously puts one hand over her ear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see that the knobby tip of her elbow is blotched with freckles . I try to be generous , but next to Caitlin she looks like a big , gawky white mouse . <p> Philidance is no place for the kinds of ballerinas people pay money to see . <p> Meredith turns from us and starts down the hall . Julianna waits for a second , then follows , shaking , unable to look at us . As she 's passing , Caitlin sticks out a foot to trip her , just as she did in rehearsal , and starts singing " Ebony and Ivory . " Julianna manages to hop over , but Meredith swings around , yanks Caitlin up by the collar of her sweatshirt , and knocks the Newport out of her mouth onto the brown rug , where it starts to make a stink like burning plastic . <p> " That 's supposed to be funny ? " Meredith says , her thin face looking haunted like a mummy 's . <p> " I think so , " says Caitlin , not blinking . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands there shaking , clutching Caitlin 's shirt for a long time . Behind them , Julianna starts sniffling again . Then Meredith says , " We 'll see about that , Caitlin , " and releases her grip . She puts her arm around Julianna , and says , " I do n't know what 's wrong with you girls , you 're like animals , " and heads down the hall again . I 'm uneasy that she includes me in the statement , and feel lousy all the way around . <p> " They must be fucking , " Caitlin whispers to me , still posing , staring after them , but I can tell she 's nervous . She slumps to the floor beside me and watches them walking away , both looking so awkward , tiny Meredith in her black unitard holding beanpole Julianna in her too-tight jeans . <p> " Look at her twist-twat , " Caitlin hisses to me , meaning the way the crotch seam of Julianna 's pants are so tight , it seems you can see her privates . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no place to go but Philidance  --  and I stand up . <p> " Where 're you going ? " she asks , grabbing my elbow . <p> " I 'm going in to practice , " I say . " Some of us do that , you know ? <p> " I 'll go with you , " she says , hauling up her big bag covered with buttons from Broadway shows and stickers with dancewear logos , stuffed so full of rubbers and sweaty things it 's half as big as she is . I think to say , " Uh uh , you 've got to go get yours from Meredith , " but I ca n't talk . <p> We walk into the studio smelling of rosin dust and coffee and sweat , and turn on the overhead lights . Caitlin pushes into the sprung floorboards with her feet ; the movement is as natural for her as blinking . We walk through the choreography , quiet , me watching her in the mirror , and her watching her in the mirror . And she says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I answer yes . " I 'm better looking , I know that , " she laughs . We mark the phrase one more time , and she says , " And I belong here more than her . " I watch her carefully , trying to figure her . She begins to whip around , not marking but really dancing , like a . . . like a what ? A juggernaut . She sweeps across the room to the mirror , stops , and lifts her right leg until her flexed foot touches her ear . Without looking at me , she says , " And so do you . " <p> " That 's right , " I say . " And I 've got nowhere else to go . So I do n't need you making waves for me . You know ? " <p> " Did you ever think about moving to New York ? " she says . " Would n't that be fun , you and me , living together in New York ? Like sisters . My mother would get us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just love you . " She places her leg down and looks at me . I see she does n't think much of what she sees . " You could get into Ailey with me , " she tries . I frown . " I 'd help you , " she says . " What do you think ? " <p> " I think that 's stupid , " I say . At that moment , we hear Meredith 's voice calling down the hall . Mad . Caitlin smacks the mirror with her fiat palm , spins out a fierce pirouette , then walks up to me , breathing angrily . <p> I shake my head , and say , " Your dancing 's fine , Caitlin ; it 's your big mouth that 's the problem . Do n't say anything stupid to her in there , okay ? At least for me , think about me . " <p> " I do think about you . We 're best friends , are n't we ? I take care of you , do n't I ? " <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's hard for me to commit myself . We hear Meredith yell again , angrier . Caitlin goes on alert , looks to the door , slaps me with a glance from those olive eyes , and I can tell my answer is important to her . My throat squeezes shut , but I finally get it out  --  " Yeah . " She seems to grow five inches ; she grabs the strap of her bag like she 's strangling it . I say , " Just be calm , do n't get her madder , okay ? Do n't mess up this show for me , okay ? " <p> But like a machine , Caitlin switches on attitude . Posing with one hand on a hip like a runway model , the other hand flying in an arc of rapid-fire snapping fingers , she says , " I 'm willing to be a little fish in a big pond , or a big fish in a little pond . I am not going to be treated like a little fish in a little pond . Step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> She brushes by me , pinches my rear hard , and says , " I 'm going to dance this solo . " <p> " Not if you get kicked out , " I say . <p> " Then you 'll get your big break . " <p> Being a little fish in a little pond myself , I did n't know what she meant . I did n't think . I did n't know what it was like to be a threat to anybody , and I did n't know what it was like to be a shark out there with other sharks . I looked Caitlin square in those big , luscious eyes and knew she was up to no good , but all I could say was , " Hmm . " <p> Although I was dying to listen in , I stayed in the studio to dance off my shot nerves by marking the choreography again by myself . I was hungry for this performance ; that 's what makes me feel guilty about the whole thing . Caitlin did n't need it  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dances . But me , I guessed I only had this one , or at most maybe two more until my senior year , when I 'd start getting ready for college . Not to say that I did n't have fantasies . I 'm a realist , though . My favorite thing , really , is just to dance by myself . I do n't even need to look in the mirror . I may not look beautiful , but I can feel beautiful . <p> The night I fell in love with ballet was the same night I realized I would never be a dancer . My parents made me take classes since I was nine . I had little recitals and stuff and I was okay , but in ballet , okay is already not good enough even for a nine-year-old . But then they took me for my twelfth birthday to the outdoor theater at the Mann Music Center to see Gelsey Kirkland in The Sleepwalker . I remember feeling each delicate step like a kick in my stomach , and crying all the way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parking lot . I drove them crazy all the way home , still crying until I went to bed that night . I made them buy me a video of it for Christmas , and I often fast-forward to the part where Gelsey , walking in her sleep , floats down the stairs , en pointe , carrying a man 's body in her arms , in her nightgown looking like a ghost . I force myself to watch it over and over again sometimes ; even though it kills me , I ca n't help it , like you ca n't help picking off a scab . I knew that first time watching her I would never , ever , ever be that graceful . <p> I know this for a fact , and I know all about hunger . People go to see ballet like they want to have a good dream , hungry for the " mystique " and all that , angry if they do n't get it . But now , after some years at it , I watch Gelsey and know that although she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your toes crushed up feeling like they 're being sucked down a bathtub drain ; being a stick but only seeing in the mirror a fat bull toad ; you got girls that barely have their periods taking drugs and talking like used old maids , weary , trying to be strong as a man and act like a woman and look like a child and dance like a ghost in a dream . Now , Caitlin does n't understand about that , but she could do it . <p> So that 's what I 'm thinking then , feeling angry at Caitlin for wasting time  --  mine and hers  --  when I hear the shouting echoing down the corridor . A door slams , and I step into the hall  --  no sign of Meredith or Julianna or any of the other girls yet , only Caitlin standing by the locker-room door , her head down . <p> " Rehearsal 's canceled , " she says , her voice scratchy like she has laryngitis . She goes inside , and even though I do n't really want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room is dark and dead quiet and cluttered with junk like a robber 's cave . Usually , it 's full of the girls chattering away , sounding like the exotic birdhouse at the Fairmount Zoo . It just about smells like that , too , with baby powder and rotten fruit and coconut-smelling Jerri-Curl and shellac and cheap perfume . One beat-up wooden bench runs between the two rows of gray metal lockers to a windowless wall and the opening to the bathroom . On the mounted mirror , someone has written in permanent ink : What are you looking at , fat bitch ? Above the mirror are the posters , the usual Harvey Edwards , one of Judith Jamison in Cry , the group shot from Blues Suite , the half-naked one of Bill T. Jones that makes my knees shake . And of course , on just about everything are the stickers reading Capezio with the tiny white stars poking out of a black background . <p> When I walk in , Caitlin turns away from me . I hear a faucet dripping , and her breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stuck up over her head but I can tell she 's rubbing her eyes . Maybe it 's stupid , but seeing someone like her cry sort of scares me , and I forget all about being mad at her . I watch her slip off her tights , waiting for her to talk . She straddles the wooden bench , all varnished and grooved and etched with the names of hundreds of girls like us . She twists her arm up around her back and fumbles at the safety pin tucking the neckline of her ripped leotard under her bra strap . I could help her , but she does n't ask , and so I let her grab at it until it flops open , stabbing her , and she curses and gives up . " Gim me a hand already , will you ? " she says , and I sit down behind her and remove the pin . She reaches into her bag and pulls out a Newport , even though we 're not allowed to smoke in the locker room , and so I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her waist and unsnaps her bra , and I can see her bare back ripple with all that pumping iron when she sucks at the cigarette . <p> " I wan na go over to your house for a while , okay ? " <p> I say , " Okay , " which seems to make her feel better . She throws her leg around , faces me on the bench , and takes my hands and we play a clapping game , which ends up a game of scissor , paper , rock . " They 're definitely fucking , " she says , and , turning up a rock to my scissors , she whips me a vicious one then leans back on the bench laughing . Puffing her chest up in the air like a Playboy model with me as the photographer , she then extends her legs and squeezes my ears with her crusty , tape-wrapped feet , and I am frankly nervous . <p> " What are you doing ? " I say , gulping . " Get off . Put your shirt on , whore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , French-inhales , and in Julianna 's squeaky , overpronouncing tone says , " Ooh , Meredith ! Oh , my baby , baby , how you tickle me so ! " <p> And that 's when we hear the scuffling in by the toilet stalls and know we 're not alone . I snatch the Newport out of her hand , stamp it out on the bench , scramble for a can of hairspray in my bag , and spritz the room with its sugary scent . But Caitlin , stalking out bare-chested like Sheena of the Jungle , heads in toward the toilets and begins peeking under the stalls and fiddling with the latches . I scan the room , all cluttered with dance bags and clothes and food wrappers and butts . Then I notice the two open lockers . One is Caitlin 's ; and hanging over the corner of the other half-open door are Julianna 's special-ordered pointe shoes from Freed 's of London . Before I can run in there , I hear the thump of a forced-open stall door , a scared squeal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl freshener , but no one ever turns on the fan since a couple of pigeons have shacked up in the vent . I step up behind Caitlin and crane my neck to look over her broad , bare shoulders . And there 's Julianna , her ankles bound up by her tight jeans , sitting folded in on herself and wriggling , looking trapped like the frogs we had to pin onto those white wax lumps in Biology class . She has her glasses on now , and her eyes seem to take up half her face as she moves them from me to Caitlin and back . The only movement in the room is the drip of the faucet and the one ball of sweat that crawls through the spiky hairs on the back of Caitlin 's neck , rolls up and down over her shoulder blades , down to the small of her back , soaking into the black cotton gathered there . I clear my throat , ready to tackle her , but she finally steps back into me and slams the door , making the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She turns and shrugs at me . " Did n't know anybody was in there . " <p> Before we head to my house , I wash the smoke off my hands and face with the neon pink liquid from the soap dispensers ( just in case my mom is home ) and brush my teeth while Caitlin gets dressed . I try to hurry because as long as we 're there , Julianna wo n't come out of the toilet stall for anything . After a while , I ca n't stand the silence . I say , " Julianna , your ankle looks like it 's getting better , today . " I 'm not talking loud , but my voice bounces everywhere ; it 's stupid , but I feel like a Benedict Arnold for talking to her . After a second , her thin voice comes out , " It 's better . Thanks . " The words echo like she 's inside the toilet bowl herself . Another pause , and she says , " You looked really good in the second movement today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in frowning and taps me . <p> " We 're ready to go , " she says . <p> I nod and spit . As I 'm walking out , Caitlin says from behind me , " It stinks like dead fish in here , " then flips the long-unused ventilation switch . There is a tired whir , a hum , then sounds of pigeons scrambling and a crackling like an axe through a wicker basket . I grab her and drag her outside fast . <p> The whole walk home , she refuses to say anything about what happened with her and Meredith . Instead , we have a mock argument . To get to my place , we have to walk past the house of the back-to-Africa group called Move ; the TV calls it a " headquarters " but to me it just looks like a nasty old rundown stinky little house . I 've lived in this part of West Philadelphia all my life and the neighborhood around here is actually pretty nice , but folks have had trouble here , and the house does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go a little out of my way to walk on the opposite , upwind curb . Caitlin is babbling , talking about her solidarity with them , which of course comes from being cheated out by Julianna . I groan . One part of her tough act which drives me nuts is pretending she 's poor and downtrodden ; she tells people she 's from " Uptown Manhattan " in a way that implies Harlem rather than her mom 's fancy condo on Central Park West . She even carries around a little ki-Swahili phrase book with her and tries to teach me words , mostly as a joke , but today I 'm not laughing . <p> " Let 's go up there and ring the doorbell and run , " she says , giggling . I grab her by the arm and drag her on . She can talk , with her own apartment and free lifestyle , dropped out of school , never having to work . She probably does n't know what it 's like to be made late for ballet classes , trapped in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white . And as we turn the corner and approach my stoop , I 'm slightly ashamed even though it 's a nice , two-story house on a clean block . I 'm ashamed , too , of my brother , Kevin , who 's sitting on the step with the radio blaring , scanning Caitlin with bloodshot eyes made fat through his gazillion-dollar , thick-lensed Gazelles . He probably did n't go to summer school today ; I see he 's high on pot from the way he giggles and stands up to assume fifth position like a crippled stork , mocking me . I walk past and ignore him . I do n't fail to notice that Caitlin 's making eyes . <p> It 's hot . We make sandwiches , make lemonade , and zone out with some TV . I 'm hoping she 'll tell me what happened in the office , but then dumb old Kevin comes in and plops his lazy butt on the couch next to her . Caitlin takes off her blouse , leaving only a cut-off half-tank top  --  a green color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat . <p> " Kevin , " I say , " the air conditioner is still broken . " <p> He covers his mouth with his hand , goes , " Hmm , " and looks away . <p> " The repairman was supposed to come today , right ? " <p> " I do n't know , " Kevin says , looking at Caitlin , not me . " I was n't here . " <p> " Damn it , Kevin . You were supposed to come home right after school and let him in ! " <p> " What are you , Mel , my mother ? " he says , chuckling like a goon . Caitlin laughs , too . <p> If you live in this city during July without AC , you know all about the four-shower-a-day cure . It 's irritating me , them making googly eyes on the couch , and it 's so hot I decide to take a long , cold one . As I 'm going up the stairs , I hear them giggling and think I hear a lighter flicking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . Go on the stoop ! " I say , then go up . <p> " What are you , his mother ? " Caitlin yells . " Do n't be in there all day , douche bag ! " <p> Kevin 's room is right across from the bathroom , and hanging on the door is a message board where he writes stuff like , " Do n't wake me up , " or " No , I did n't clean it yet . " I scribble " Jerkoff " on it and have my shower . <p> I 'm relaxing , forgetting about the day , playing with the shower massager and singing . It feels so good , easing my aching doggies with the loofah , I think I never want to get out . Then , after about thirty minutes , I hear the bathroom door creak open . I ca n't believe it . Through the plastic curtain , I see a shape , Caitlin 's , naked and shiny , rounded and dark red-brown like a violin . I can also make out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh my God , " I say , tearing aside the plastic , reaching for a towel to cover myself . <p> " What do you think you 're doing ? " I say , and I 've a funny , knotted feeling inside . Before Caitlin finishes saying , " We 're coming in with you , douche bag , " I see Kevin , also naked , grinning , lurking there in the hall like some doorman . I look back at her , check out her bunchy , shining cheeks , and know what she calls a " just-fucked glow " when I see one . <p> " Oh no you do n't ! " I shout , yanking Caitlin in by her hard arm . Kevin scratches himself , raises a gangly arm , points to the ceiling like he 's just hit on the answer to the theory of relativity , and goes , " Yo ! " <p> " Get lost , Lurch ! " I yell , slamming the door on his lousy grin . Livid , I shake Caitlin and beg , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dripping wet as I am , she hugs me , and I smell pot smoke in her hair . Seeing my face above her shoulder in the mirror , I feel used . Without really thinking , I grab a hairbrush off the sink and smack her with it . Kevin tries to poke his head in again , and I hurl it at his chest , shouting , " Moro 's gon na kill both of us , now ! " I hear a slam across the hall and the rattle of the message-board pen . <p> Gripping Caitlin by the elbow , I swing the door open , make sure the way is clear , and drag her down the hall to my room . Still wet , I throw on my purple sweats and sandals , go back out , pound on Kevin 's door until he throws out her clothes , and get her dressed . " I ca n't believe you , " I keep saying over and over , although I actually can . <p> " I do n't see why you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I drag her back down the hall , she sings out , " Bye , Kevin . " And from behind his door comes a muffled " Later . " The living room reeks of pot , but I ca n't find the roach ; Kevin usually eats them when he 's done . I pick up her bag and blouse from the couch , dump them in her hands , and throw her outside onto the porch . <p> " Where we going ? " she says , but I 'm too choked up to answer . <p> I push her ahead of me down the street , back toward Philidance and the bus into Center City , past the stinky house . I 'm thinking of things I want to say to her , but finally decide it 's just time for her to go home . Halfway there , she tells me she 's left her wallet in the locker at Philidance . My heart sinks . That means I 'll have to go in ; if Meredith saw Caitlin like this . . . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathetic , embarrassing me . " You know I love you . " <p> " You shut up , Caitlin , " I say , still choking . " You 're just fucked up , that 's all . " <p> " You 're angry , " she says . Can you believe it ? " It 's all that lesbo white bitch 's fault . . . " <p> " Are you crazy ? ! " I yell , unable to control myself . " Have you just lost your mind or something ? It 's not Julianna 's fault , it 's your fault ! This whole day has been one big waste ' cause you go acting like a mental patient , walking around all slutty and half-naked thinking you 're the Queen of Sheba , fucking my brother , terrorizing Julianna , mouthing off to everybody , getting me in trouble at rehearsal and at home . . . " She flinches as if I am hitting her , but sort of giggles , too , her eyes fixed on the Cats button on her bag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You know , girl , " I say , " the only thing I love more than having fucked-up people telling me how they love me over and over again is having an argument with them when they 're too stupid to get it . Look at you , all giggling and bobbing your head like one of those Moonies that ca n't speak English . " She does n't answer , so I just damp my mouth shut , feeling ready to pop . <p> We turn the corner and tramp up the block back toward Philidance . She keeps looking all around like she 's lost . I have to tug her by the sleeve . " Why do n't we move to New York together , Mel ? You and me . " <p> " You shut up now , Caitlin . " <p> As we come up opposite the red brick building , I glance into the diner to see if any teachers are there , but it 's empty . I tell her to stay there and wait for me . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staring into the sky . " I 'm gon na get a cab . " <p> " Whatever , " I say . <p> " You got ta wait so long for a cab in Philadelphia , " she whines , taking it as a personal insult . <p> " Whatever , " I repeat . I check for traffic , then run across and up into the building . Usually , we have to knock on the door until Jimmy , the security guard , comes to let us in , but the front doors are still unlocked . I slip in  --  hallway 's clear , office door 's closed  --  and head to the locker room . After three tries , I remember the numbers on her combination lock and curse as mounds and mounds of junk tumble out at my feet . I go through the pile , nothing . I reach up over the top shelf , come out with a package of Twinkies , a Prince cassette without the box , a photo of Caitlin and some thirtyish-looking guy down at Penn 's Landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallet . Then I see in the back a man 's dance belt hanging from a hook like a trophy , and the black eelskin wallet nestled inside its crotch pouch . I kick the pile of junk back into the locker and dash out again . <p> In the hall , I rush past old Jimmy , who looks a lot like my granddad just before he died . He waves his rank cigar at me . As always , he shouts out in that gravelly , one-lunged voice , " Close dat do ' behind you ! " <p> " Okay , Jim ! " <p> When I reach the front stoop , I see the yellow-checkered cab at the curb , with Caitlin and Julianna standing by the open rear door . Expecting the worst , I run down crazily going , " Hold it ! Hold it ? Julianna stands with one arm crossed in front around her stomach , the other fluttering on her fiat chest . She does n't look too nervous , but she does n't look too comfortable either . Caitlin , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hands on hips , slightly rocking forward , staring at the hand like a drunk kitten watching a moth . Only the sweaty-faced , blond-bearded cabbie actually turns to look at me . <p> " What are you doing ? " I demand , breathless . <p> Caitlin looks at me for a second and says , " Oh ! Where did you go ? " She lets out a whooping laugh , doing Moms Mabley again . " Me and Jules here just been patching things up ' tween us . Is n't that right , chile ? " I look to Julianna , who crinkles up her freckly forehead and nods , but slides the hand up to her ear again . It occurs to me now that she may do this simply because of the volume of girls ' talk at a place like Philidance ; we get pretty loud compared to the backstage twitter at a place like the Pennsylvania Ballet . Caitlin is practically screaming in her ear , " Tell Mel how I ' pologized ? <p> " Sure , " Julianna says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " That 's right ! " Caitlin bellows , beaming at me . I hand over her wallet and nod , but do n't trust her for a second . " I even suggested we take this here cab together , did n't I ? But we going in opposite directions , right ? " She unsnaps the wallet , starts leafing intently through it , and answers herself , " That 's right , Jules . Well , I feel soooo bad for giving you a hard time , a new girl like you . Tell you what , you take this cab . " She walks around to the front passenger-side window and calls the cabbie to attention . " Hey , baby . " Suddenly springing to life , he slaps the Obsession cologne dispenser on the dashboard and spins around . " Call up on that radio to get me another ride , okay ? Make him a cutie , too . " The man strokes his gold beard all sad , kissing his dream fare goodbye . <p> " You do n't have to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , throwing a hand up like a traffic cop . <p> " No , I feel so bad . I want you to . Guess I was just a little jealous , you know , with you being new and all . I guess I thought , was hoping , maybe me or Mel here should a had the part , but that 's nothing . Best girl won , is all . Go on , take the cab . " I feel my face take on an amazed expression that must make me look as stupid as Kevin . Caitlin bends to lean into the cab , and again I fixate on the bumps of her lower spine , like a dinosaur 's , exposed when her half-top creeps up . The cabbie makes no effort to pretend he 's not ogling the cleavage and round skin tumbled towards him , but only nods when she says , " Take gooood care of my girlfrien ' here , baby ! I 'll find you if you do n't . She gon na be a star someday ! " She flashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the open rear doorframe and returns to her wallet-search , and I know now something is definitely wrong . <p> " Well , okay . Thank you , " says Julianna . She hesitates , then holds out a hand to shake , but Caitlin is too wrapped up in digging through her wallet , so she throws her bag in across the seat . " Thank you very much , Caitlin . " Ducking her head , bending with difficulty in those skintight jeans , Julianna scoots butt-for-ward halfway into the cab . At that moment , Caitlin lets out a chilling whoop and swings on me ; puffing her cheeks and squinting her eyes , she shouts , " Where 's my money , witch ? ! " <p> " What ? " I am staggered . <p> " I trust you to get my wallet ' cause I 'm not feeling well , and you go and rip me off like this ? How was I supposed to get home ? You think of that ? ! " <p> I 'm wondering , What the hell is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got the wrong wallet . Then I 'm thinking , Maybe she just wants an excuse to make Julianna have to share a ride . Pulling me into some kind of game . I try to nip it in the bud . " I got money , Caitlin , " I say . " You 'll get home . " <p> But she just twists up her face uglier , meaner , steps into me chest-to-chest , hisses , " Damn right I will ! Gim me my fucking money , nigger ! " I 'm so floored I ca n't talk , ca n't move , just let her push me back a step . I 'm thinking , Or maybe Julianna ripped her off out of revenge ? In the corner of my eye , I see the pale girl paralyzed , frozen one leg in , one leg out of the cab , not knowing what to do  --  to help me or not . I know she did n't do it . <p> " You gon na get yours ! " Caitlin howls , jumping at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in the sides with rabbit punches , but not hard enough to hurt . I 'm wondering , What the fuck . . . ? And then , just as I 'm giving her the lightest of shoves , I see her grin . <p> I can swear I hardly touched her . But that 's not what makes me guilty . My memory sees it like a slow-mo replay of a pole vaulter  --  mouth open , sharp shoulder first  --  but really it took less than a blink . Even though I did n't know what was going on , I sort of did . This cloudy , fleeting thought zapped out of my head like a piece of burnt toast popping out of a toaster too late . Big break , are the words I thought . Julianna did n't have time to move . <p> Under her own force , I 'm sure  --  off those legs that could press two hundred pounds easy  --  Caitlin hurls back through the air wearing a big Cheshire grin . That muscular back meets the window glass , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African dance poses blots out the yellow and black checkers of the door . There 's a white flash of sun off the chrome handle . I see the blue denim and the crisscross laces on the white girl 's bare , freckled ankle . I see her sandal sole still glued to the melting black street tar , then rust on the yellow metal edge of the door . A crunch like a heavy suitcase slamming bounces down the steamy , empty street . The cabbie only shuts his eyes and throttles his beard . And I hear the howl floating up and up like a ghost mixed with the flapping and squawking of the pigeons which scatter from the sidewalk and zip out of sight over the roof of the dance school . <p> That 's how my name got into that program . <p> When I came back out of the office from calling 911 , the sun still hung there high and hot , but tired . The cabbie stood a foot or two from the car , trying to decide whether to keep his hands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sniffing his beard . He had removed his shirt  --  to wrap the leg , I suppose  --  and I saw a tattoo of a skeleton holding up a banner reading Baby-doll on his shoulder , and rings of clumped , soggy powder under his armpits . I saw the clotted red-brown like barbecue sauce already baking into the nooks of the tar . I did n't look inside the taxi . Obviously , Caitlin was nowhere to be seen . <p> I missed her call the next day , as Meredith was forced to hold a string of emergency rehearsals with me and a new group of girls , but I had already figured she was on her way back to New York . Walking in that Sunday morning , I stopped at the diner and got a coffee in an " I Love Philly " paper cup and a pack of Newports from the machine . Then , I went straight in , was asked by my reflection , " What are you looking at , fat bitch , " dialed the combination by memory , and moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After I told some parts of this story to Meredith a couple of times , she said that I had been doing much better , though not in the way you 'd say it to a big fish . Like I said , I 'm an okay dancer , and there are lots of girls trying to do this who are less than okay , especially in the summer months when the first company is away touring or on vacation . It was n't a great show , but it ran for a week and people liked it . I was pleased by the applause , and people came up afterward and smeared lipstick on my face and told me I was fierce and that made me feel good . My mom and dad brought flowers , and they forced Kevin to sit through it , too . I even got a write-up in two little weekend tabloids ; one of them even called me " graceful . " <p> But like I said , it 's a hard business . Since that time , I 've only performed in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as jazz is sexier and only works with women 's bodies . It 's okay , though , since I 'm mostly occupied now preparing to take the PSATs for college . My favorite thing still is coming in alone on a weekend , closing the door politely for old Jimmy , reading that sign by the front , <p> Those who dance are thought mad by those who hear not the music . <p> Stirring up the rosin dust on the sprung floors with my eyes closed , sleepwalking , trusting I 'll sort it all out later , I just figure that right now I 've got all the moments in the sun I need . <p> <p> By Stewart David Ikeda <p>
