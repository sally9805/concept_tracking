I wish this was over , " the President said . " after I leave this place , I never want to see it again . " Bill Clinton on Monday night , after his sorta culpa ? No . President Ulysses Grant in 1875 , after scandals had smudged his Civil War gloss . Clinton has been reading about Grant , who he believes got a " bum rap . " Both men were subjected to all manner of low-grade calumny : mostly financial scandals for Grant , mostly Monica for Clinton . For both , the accusations were constant , painful and irrelevant to a majority of the public . Grant remained the nation 's most popular politician even postscandal . Ditto Clinton . But today Grant is considered an utter failure . Can Clinton avoid that fate ? " He 's probably going to be driving himself even more , because he will want more than ever for history not to carry this as the headline , " says Clinton 's former chief of staff Leon Panetta . Some of the President 's options : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ronald Reagan steered deliberately to the center , hoping to end his presidency on a good note . He made sure to pass a couple of solidly popular domestic measures with bipartisan support . For Clinton , that could be rewriting the managed-care files and saving Social Security from bankruptcy . Overseas he needs one clear win . Reagan had a Soviet arms-control deal ; Clinton could try for progress in the Middle East peace talks . <P> THE HOUSECLEANING FORMULA The idea here is to set a new tone as quickly as possible . Clinton might announce that he will immediately drop all appeals of the various legal privileges and answer any questions Kenneth Starr cares to ask . Clinton could also release his grand jury testimony . He might even ask for the resignation of anyone who tried to help Monica Lewinsky find work , such as Energy Secretary Bill Richardson or deputy chief of staff John Podesta , no matter who asked them to do so . Problem : that could leave people wondering why Clinton is still there . <P> THE COMEBACK-KID STRATEGY It 's Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road , and let the pictures tell the story . Go overseas . When you come home , tout those transportation-bill projects . Raise money for the Democrats now and through 2000 . Pray for Al Gore . <P>  --  By John Cloud .
