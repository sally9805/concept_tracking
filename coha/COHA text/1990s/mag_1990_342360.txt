Harry Weinberg was a pugnacious businessman who probably had his share of enemies when he was alive . But the real estate baron made a final gesture that will win him friends for years to come . Weinberg , who died last week at 82 , willed nearly $1 billion to a family trust to help the poor . The sum represents his entire estate , except for $3 million he left his grandchildren . The trust will distribute up to $45 million a year to the needy as Weinberg dictated : one-quarter to Jewish charities , one-quarter to non-Jewish groups and the rest to organizations that serve the poor , regardless of race or religion . <P> A grammar school dropout , Weinberg built his fortune by buying Baltimore real estate at bargain prices and later investing in transit companies and Hawaiian properties . Weinberg 's largesse was not entirely a surprise . During a 1984 visit to Israel , he donated $1 million to buy air conditioners for the country 's nursing homes .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
