For one moment last week , it seemed possible that the Senators might unravel the tight bundle of polite obfuscation that is Clarence Thomas , Supreme Court nominee . Delaware 's Joseph Biden , who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee , jabbed him with questions and snappy comebacks on Thursday morning , and Thomas was briefly thrown off his monotone . But his Republican handlers called for a break , and both Thomas and his Democratic inquisitors returned to a harmless game of parry and dodge . <P> After 22 hours of testimony , the 14 members of the Senate Judiciary Committee extracted little from Thomas . He told them the Constitution embraced a right to privacy but refused to offer any thoughts on the Supreme Court 's Roe v. Wade abortion decision . He did not repudiate his writings favoring the use of " natural law " but said they were the musings of a part-time political theorist and would have no bearing on his interpretation of the Constitution . The Democrats had to admit they were stymied . " Who this man really is , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wisconsin . The Republicans happily bragged about their strategy . " It 's O.K. not to give the answer as long as it 's not because you do n't know the answer , " said a senior Administration official . <P> If the hearings revealed little about Thomas , they said much about the limits of a body that has become one of the liberals ' last redoubts on Capitol Hill , the only place where Democrats , locked out of the White House for the past 10 years , can attempt to fend off conservative nominees to the court . Even when Biden and Massachusetts ' Edward Kennedy teamed up four years ago to defeat Robert Bork , it looked as if the Democrats could only briefly prevent the Reagan White House from seizing control of the Supreme Court well into the 21st century . That proved a Pyrrhic victory . <P> After Bork , the White House devised a sort of Ferdinand the Bull strategy for future nominees : it taught them to win by refusing to engage . " There is n't much that the Senate can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nominee has to say is , ' I have an open mind , ' " says Yale Kamisar of the University of Michigan Law School . With that strategy , the White House easily slipped through the innocuous but no less conservative Anthony Kennedy and the enigmatic David Souter . Says Kamisar : " The lesson is that the Bork hearings were an aberration . " <P> So why have Supreme Court hearings at all ? For more than 100 years , the committee did without them . And even after they began in 1925 , there were nominees like William O. Douglas in 1939 who waited patiently to be questioned only to be sent home . But while this public bar exam has become de rigueur , its rules have changed from nomination to nomination , with Republicans and Democrats often contradicting themselves on what questions are appropriate . Some examples of Senators who condemn " litmus tests " at one hearing but brandish them at the next : <P>  --  When Lyndon Johnson picked Justice Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice in 1968 , conservatives like South Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; after 10 days on the hot seat , Fortas was ultimately rejected . But during the Bork hearings , Thurmond argued that his colleagues should consider only the judge 's competence , temperament and integrity .
