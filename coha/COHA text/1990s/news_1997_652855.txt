<p> NEW YORK 's trophy apartments  --  the Village charmers with front-and-back fireplaces , the TriBeCa lofts with three exposures , the prewar dowagers with haughty architectural bones  --  probably inspire more action-packed dinner party tales than big-game safaris ever did . <p> But most of us working stiffs live in ordinary places , apartments with eight-foot ceilings and five-by-seven bathrooms  --  apartments without a trace of excess , accident or eccentricity , but heavy with the sense that the meter was running when the apartment was being built . Many of these efficiency digs are in so-called " vanilla " buildings  --  bland postwar apartment blocks with glazed white-brick facades . For apartment snobs , such buildings occupy the mid to lower genealogical limbs of Manhattan 's real estate tree . For architects , their down-to-the-square-inch plans allow little room for maneuvering . <p> Fredericka Taylor , an owner of the TZ'Art &; Company gallery in SoHo and a member of the architecture and design committee of the Museum of Modern Art , lived in a trophy apartment on Ninth Street in Greenwich Village with drop-dead coziness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carved-plaster ceiling dating from the eclectic 1920 's . In 1989 , it was renovated by the New York architects Henry Smith-Miller and Laurie Hawkinson , and widely published . Ms. Taylor lived there happily until her two grown daughters left home , which netted her two spare bedrooms in an apartment that needed painting . It was time to move . <p> Chafing at the narrow dimensions of the town house , Ms. Taylor realized she wanted a more expansive environment : " I wanted a place with outdoor space and a view . " <p> The hunt led her to the upper floors of an antiseptic white building in the Village with a Cinemascopic terrace view of the Hudson and the great valley of buildings between the Village and Wall Street . The terrace , however , came attached to a gaggle of small , maximally efficient apartments that had the potential to become a 2,000-square-foot " loft . " <p> " I was totally taken with all the outdoor space and views , " Ms. Taylor said . " Henry and Laurie hated it on first sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told them it was too late . Now it was their problem . " <p> Styles of course come and go , but what is particularly telling in architecture is that moment when overlooked buildings like this iceberg suddenly edge their way back into visual consciousness  --  when the familiar and invisible recapture the eye . " I like it for its ordinariness  --  the banality , the anonymity , the lack of pretension , " she said . " I suppose 60 's architecture has come back along with 60 's furniture , and nontrendiness now is trendy . " <p> Ms. Hawkinson , who was the partner in charge of the apartment 's design , said , " Freddie 's an insightful art dealer and had the kind of vision to imagine all of these rooms together . " Ms. Taylor 's instinct was encouraged by a friend , the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas ( author of " Delirious New York " ) . <p> " Rem saw it and said it 's so quintessentially New York , " Ms. Taylor said . " He absolutely loves this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan 's verticality . " The low horizon line of her interiors complements the wide terrace panorama and recalls the influence of the open , flat landscape on America 's Prairie School architects , especially Frank Lloyd Wright . <p> " I 'm sympathetic with the 50 's and 60 's period , and a great admirer of its building stock , but of course the horizontality meant we had no height to manipulate , " Ms. Hawkinson said . " We had to invent a way to work with what we found . " <p> Smith-Miller &; Hawkinson was accustomed to her needs , having previously worked with Ms. Taylor on a prewar classic on East 93d , her gallery and the offices for an arts foundation , besides the Ninth Street apartment . " She 's a modernist  --  the kind of adventurous client who does n't care to have a parlor , " Mr. Smith-Miller said . Among her requirements were open space and generous walls for the art she likes to live with before it appears in her gallery . <p> After designing two apartments , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed her . ( " By this time , they 're old friends , or enemies , for Henry and Laurie , " Ms. Taylor said . ) They include her grandmother 's antique desk and a hanging lamp by the early-20th-century Dutch modernist Gerrit Rietveld , as well as his complex wood De Stijl sideboard . " I 'm from Holland originally , and that piece becomes the heart of my apartments , " she said . <p> She asked for a guest room , a master bedroom and a kitchen open to a living area that would be large enough for receptions . The space also made its own demands . The basic functional issue was how to combine several apartments  --  which yielded a surfeit of kitchens and bathrooms , even for a woman who entertains frequently . There was also the esthetic issue of the space so tightly sandwiched between floor and ceiling . <p> " I think I always make Laurie and Henry do things that are slightly off what they would naturally do , " Ms. Taylor said . " It was the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in a way liberating for them , because the apartment did n't have any historical details to contend with . " <p> The architects proceeded by a process of elimination . " Rather than putting new things into an empty space , we were taking things away , " Mr. Smith-Miller said , describing a weeding process that turned out to be unpredictable . " With a recipe , when you reduce a sauce , you basically know what the end result is going to be . But in a subtractive process , you do n't , and we did n't . We just started taking out walls here , kitchens and doors and halls there . The things we could live without . Reduction is based in theory ; the subtraction came from the field . " <p> The architects embarked without a grand master plan or even a preconceived esthetic  --  " to find out what was there , " Mr. Smith-Miller said . <p> After they stripped away walls , the architects found immovable trees  --  that is , the plumbing chases , ventilator ducts , structural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the architects wrapped in steel sleeves and plaster , created a grove in the otherwise loftlike space , giving it a spatial porosity : the back living room is viewed through what they called a forest . <p> " The forest became a place for hanging art and placing sculpture that encouraged intimate viewing within an area you 'd move through , " Ms. Hawkinson said . <p> Mr. Smith-Miller said : " We 're dealing with very late 50 's modernism , but the developer had forgotten the open plan . We basically took out rooms that should n't have been there and made it into a generous open space . " <p> Within the overall strategy , the architects developed a tactic based on details . They removed paint from standard air-conditioning covers to expose the metal , and made light valances for paintings out of exposed steel . They laid floors of cold-rolled steel plate in the heavily trafficked kitchen and entrance . They exposed any and all mechanisms , like the tracks supporting a long sliding wall ( which doubles the wall space for viewing art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaster unpainted , emphasizing matter in the unstated battle every architect fights against the bland abstractions of plasterboard . In all ways they attempted to leave the mark of the hand , in response to the machine esthetic that had made the original apartments so dry . <p> All the decisions about materials and forms gather into an interlocking puzzle that confirms a law of chaos theory  --  that simple systems added together breed complexity . Perhaps the boldest move was to float a lowered ceiling down the walkway from the entry to the living room . Made of oak flooring , what the architects call their " surfboard " hyphenates the front and back spaces and gives the room a second height dramatized by backlighting . <p> Little by little , the boring , boxy interiors acquired an austere , elegant Shakerlike appearance , with blond wood and metal accents . Ms. Taylor furnished the interiors sparely with a red Eileen Gray sofa and a foursome of cube chairs by Le Corbusier . She brought her old Traulsen refrigerator along , which the architects displayed in the open kitchen like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideboard earned a niche of honor between the front and back living areas ; coincidentally , the piece presaged the layered richness of modernist space explored in this apartment . <p> With their laissez-faire approach , the architects found a certain " give " in apartments that were originally planned with designated places for beds , sofas and dining tables . The logic of the robotic assembly line had lived on in plans that implicitly regulated how people walked through their lives at home , as though on a factory floor . <p> " There 's a postwar mentality of industrial standardization embedded in these populist buildings , which were built as inexpensive housing for the masses , like vertical Levittowns , and you had to accept that posture because the plumbing and layout locked you in , " Ms. Hawkinson said . " We tried to subvert that . " <p> Granted , the architects had the luxury of 2,000 square feet , but they also freed the spaces of their cookie-cutter imprint and the concomitant idea that there are only one or two ways to occupy a room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a freely shaped kitchen island and a cantilevered pass-through cupboard , epitomizes the new informality . Relaxing the apartment 's attitudes proved that there was architectural life in the box yet , no matter the size . " I do n't think modernism has been exhausted , " Ms. Hawkinson said .
