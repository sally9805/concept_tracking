... Kitty and Eugene lived in a narrow row house at the corner of Baker and Rose , across from the old Milped Button Factory . The front door sat flush to the sidewalk without benefit of yard or porch . The exterior was maroon asphalt shingle with weathered white trim . Curtains were drawn in the front room . Upstairs windows were dark . I had pepper spray easily accessible in my jacket pocket , and my cuffs and stun gun stuck into my Levis . I knocked on the door and heard scrambling going on inside . I knocked again , and a man 's voice shouted something incoherent . Again , more shuffling sounds , and then the door opened . A young woman peered out at me from behind a security chain . " Yes ? " " Are you Kitty Petras ? " " What do you want ? " " I 'm looking for your husband , Eugene . Is he at home ? " " No . " " I heard a man 's voice in there . I thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a pinched face and large brown eyes . She wore no makeup . Her brown hair was pulled back in a ponytail at the nape of her neck . She was n't pretty , but she was n't unattractive either . Mostly , she was nothing . She had forgettable features that abused women get after years of trying to make themselves invisible . She gave me a wary look . " You know Eugene ? " " I work for his bonding agent . Eugene missed his court date yesterday , and we 'd like him to reschedule . " Not so much a lie as a half-truth . First we 'd reschedule him , and then we 'd lock him up in a dingy , smelly cell until his new date came around . " I do n't know ... " Eugene reeled into my line of sight through the crack in the door . " What 's going on ? " Kitty stepped away . " This woman would like you to reschedule your court date . " Eugene shoved his face up close . All nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ? " I repeated the baloney about rescheduling and moved to the side so he would be forced to open the door if he wanted to see me . The chain slid free and clanked against the jamb . " You 're shitting me , right ? " Eugene said . I positioned myself halfway into the door , adjusted my pocketbook on my shoulder , and lied my little heart out . " This will only take a few minutes . We need you to stop in at the courthouse and register for a new date . " " Yeah , well , you know what I have to say to that ? " He turned his back to me , dropped his pants and bent over . " Kiss my hairy white ass . " He was facing in the wrong direction to give him a snootful of pepper spray , so I reached into my Levi 's and pulled out the stun gun . I 'd never used it , but it did n't seem complicated . I leaned foward , firmly pressed the gadget against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eugene gave a short squeak and crumpled to the floor like a sack of flour . " My God , " Kitty cried , " what have you done ? " I looked down at Eugene , who was lying motionless , eyes glazed , drawers at his knees . He was breathing a little shallowly , but I thought this was to be expected from a man who 'd just taked enough juice to light up a small room . His color was pasty white , so nothing had changed there . " Stun gun , " I said . " According to the brochure it leaves no lasting damage . " " Too bad . I was hoping you 'd killed him . " " Maybe you should fix his pants , " I said to Kitty . There was already too much ugliness in this world without having to look at Eugene 's Mr. Droopy.
