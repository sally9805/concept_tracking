<p> The walls are carpeted , the ceiling 's low , the room is adorned with teddy bears and the students write in crayon . It 's a classroom , but there are no children here  --  just workaday adults stretched out on futons in their stocking feet . <p> Once a week they come to this Northern Virginia office building for a long night of soul-searching , role-playing , temperature-reading and confession . They are men and women struggling with the toughest assignment some of them have ever had  --  learning how to become good mates . <p> Some couples are here because their marriages are dangling from a ledge . Others are trying to avoid the mistakes of previous relationships . Some are just looking for more effective ways to communicate with each other . <p> " We certainly have people come in some level of distress , " said Ellen Haag , who teaches the 16-week class known as PAIRS ( Practical Application of Intimate Relationship Skills ) . " Sometimes it 's a quiet panic . They 've been together for a while and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't want to get a divorce . " <p> As the roles of men and women in American society have changed in recent decades , couples are finding it harder than ever to stay together . Census Bureau statisticians project that at least four marriages out of every 10 taking place today will end in divorce . The marriages that survive do so not because of luck , experts say , but because of hard work and skill . This is the age of negotiation in marriage : Who takes off work when a child is sick ? Who handles the family finances ? Who pays for the movie ? <p> " We 've gone from marriages where very little needed to be negotiated , " said Howard Markman , a psychologist at the University of Denver , " to ones where nearly everything needs to be negotiated . " <p> It 's the success or failure of that process that often determines the durability of relationships . That 's one reason for the growth of programs like PAIRS , which has counseled 30,000 people in the last 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey of 301 couples  --  conducted by The Washington Post , Harvard University and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation highlights the challenges couples face managing careers , raising families , divvying responsibilities and keeping their individual identities intact . While changing gender roles have considerably altered the way men and women relate to each other in schools , on dates and in the workplace , in the confines of marriage and home life , the shifts have not been so dramatic . The surveys portray an America where married couples have the same bifurcated lives that their parents and grandparents had , where men bring home most of the bacon , and women  --  though now forces in the workplace  --  continue to run the household . <p> From cooking and washing clothes to paying the bills and taking children to the doctor , women are carrying the heaviest load at home . Studies show that men are doing more around the house than they did in the past , but husbands mow lawns , shovel snow and fix toilets while wives shop for birthday presents , drop off kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It may be that men are still able to use their greater economic power to opt out of doing work at home , " said Andrew Cherlin , a Johns Hopkins University sociologist who has studied family and marriage . " Or it may be that people 's preferences are in reality less egalitarian than we thought . " <p> Ella and Gary Given , who were surveyed by the Post/Harvard/Kaiser poll , live in rural Buckhannon , W.Va. , where they are raising small children . A coal miner , Gary , 44 , wants to retire and stay home with the kids when a full-time job opens up for his wife , now a part-time mail carrier . <p> But Ella , 38 , is skeptical . " I 'm not sure I want that responsibility to be the full-time provider , " she said . She watched her in-laws go through a similar role reversal when Gary 's father retired from the mines and his mother kept working . She would come home and complain that the house was a wreck . And he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor is dirty . " <p> Gary understands . Although he helps around the house , especially with the children , he knows that women get stuck with the brunt of the housework  --  even those who are bringing home a paycheck . It 's not fair , he argued , but it happens . " The guy says , ' I 've done my job , I 'm tired , ' " Gary explained . " And the woman , she just has to go ahead and do it . " <p> Indeed , the Post survey of couples indicates that more women than men are bothered by the traditional division of duties . For instance , 38 percent of women , compared with 24 percent of men , have a problem with the amount of housework their spouses do . <p> Not surprisingly , women feel the most stress from the arrangement . Sixty-nine percent of women , compared with 50 percent of men , said there is too much pressure to have it all  --  marriage , family and a successful career . <p> Nevertheless , the poll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way their households are managed and couples are in general agreement on many aspects of their lives . Overwhelming majorities of both sexes say they are satisfied with how affectionate and attentive their spouse is , with the number of interests they have in common , with the money their families earn and with the amount of time they spend together as partners . <p> Married men and women also are in sync on adultery , a private issue that recently has become more public than ever given the ongoing independent counsel investigation of the president . For weeks , President Clinton has been battling allegations by a former White House aide that they had a sexual relationship . He has denied that such an affair existed , and Hillary Rodham Clinton has staunchly stood by his side . Respondents to the Post poll were asked if they would leave their spouses if they discovered an affair : Forty-nine percent of the men and 47 percent of the women said no . Thirty-nine percent of the women and 37 percent of the men said yes . And 14 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences between men and women on what 's important to them as individuals and in how they handle their relationship problems . It 's essential to married women that they be able to talk to friends about what 's happening in their lives ( 68 percent said it was important , compared with 55 percent of men . ) Married men , meanwhile , place a premium on having lots of free time to relax and pursue hobbies away from their mate ( 52 percent said that 's important , compared with 34 percent of women ) . <p> As marriages have become more complex and more difficult to hold together , many couples are finding help in places that did n't exist when their parents and grandparents were starting out . Once , there was only the psychologist or family clergyman to visit . Now , there are " relationship enhancement " courses , weekend retreats , marriage education conferences , videos , board games , Internet chat rooms . <p> David E. Sanford , a couples therapist in Maine , has created a playbook for couples called " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commonwealth University offers a five-hour " marriage enrichment workshop " designed to make solid marriages even stronger . Games Partnership , a San Francisco-based company , has developed a series of romantic games  --  the " Time for Two " collection , as it 's known  --  to put the spark back in relationships . " An Enchanting Evening , " for instance , calls for players to roll a die , advancing around the board answering questions about each other and following directives from the cards they select ( " Gently stroke something that your partner has two of " ) . The first person to the finish line is granted his or her secret wish . <p> Diane Sollee , director of the Coalition for Marriage , Family and Couples Education , said couples have far more options than they once did to address their problems . They also are getting better advice from professionals . <p> " We 're now convinced we were on the wrong track , " said Sollee , referring to the way marriage counselors used to ascribe marital problems to childhood character disorders or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who stay happy and those who crash and burn are skills . The notion of luck , finding Mr. or Mrs. Right , is overrated . It 's a skills game . " <p> Every Tuesday night for 16 weeks , couples gather in a Fairfax County meeting room to work on their skills . They are expected to absorb hundreds of pages of material and a new lexicon  --  terms like " emotional allergy " ( buried psychological injuries from the past ) and " Vesuvius " ( the venting of emotional steam ) . The instructors are fond of analogies : " When you throw up , " said Ellen Haag , urging classmates not to hold anything back , " you feel really good . " <p> In PAIRS , no topic is unapproachable . Not at a rate of $ 1,400 per couple . Haag and her partner , Chuck Purcell , encourage their pupils to dig deep . And they do . They talk about everything from orgasms to laundry . They write " letting go of grudges " letters in which they finish sentences like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass around gum , crack jokes , are soothed by New Age music and use posterboard and colored markers to communicate without speaking . <p> Bill and Linda Townsend are there . <p> After 17 years , they are still searching for the right groove . <p> " We love each other , " she said . " But I need to feel better about our relationship . " <p> Both admit they wish they were better at communicating with each other . <p> Bill , a 60-year-old former fighter pilot who is now a defense consultant , was raised in a traditional family ; his mother stayed home and his father was a career Navy man . One month after Bill graduated from the Naval Academy , he married his first wife , an admiral 's daughter . <p> " Talk about falling into the mold , " he said . " Did I have any appreciation about the differences of men and women ? No . Probably throughout my first marriage , I just took everything for granted . We never talked about our likes and desires , concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew up . You did n't talk about those things . " Linda , a banker , is very different from his mother and previous wife . <p> " I never had a realization that a woman could function in this world other than to be there for a man , " Bill said , " that she could be a friend , a business associate , a partner . " <p> Some of their difficulties have been trivial , some not . She believes he is n't affectionate enough . He says she expects him to know what she 's thinking without ever telling him . <p> Linda acknowledges she has trouble expressing what 's on her mind , but says Bill does n't listen well . " More often than not I just want someone to listen , to validate my feelings . If I wanted him to help me fix it , then I 'd ask him . " <p> Linda and Bill have spent a lot of time and energy on their relationship . At one point , Linda left temporarily . Now , they 're encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all they 've learned through PAIRS has paid off . <p> Unlike the Townsends , John Swanson and Liwayway Adkins have not been to the altar . Not yet . They are dedicated to each other and serious about learning the techniques of building a strong relationship . <p> Both have parents who 've been through divorce . " Divorce is something that 's burned in your psyche , " said Swanson , whose father , a school psychologist , raised the children . " We 're sometimes scarred by our parents ' absence of permanence . " <p> Swanson , 38 , is a civil engineer . Adkins , 31 , is working on her PhD in environmental economics . They met on a volleyball court in Vienna and were friends for six months before becoming romantic . <p> Both thought it would be a good idea , before the relationship turned toward marriage , to get counseling . The PAIRS class was " sort of like me getting an owner 's manual for myself , " he said . " The problem with most relationships is you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going . You know you want to resolve the problem , but you do n't know how . " <p> Every trying episode offers practice . <p> Adkins recalled a recent shopping excursion to Wal-Mart . She asked Swanson to grab a coffee maker from a shelf that was out of reach . He jumped up , as if to snatch a rebound , and the box came crashing to the floor . <p> " Boy , that was dumb , " Adkins said , going on to scold him further . Why had n't he stepped on one of the lower shelves to retrieve the item ? Later , when both returned to the car , she noticed that Swanson was quiet . She kept asking what was wrong and he kept talking in abstractions . Finally , she figured it out . He was mad because she had snapped at him about the fumbled coffee maker . <p> " It took me a while to decode his cryptic language , which made me upset , " she recalled . An argument ensued . And an evening was ruined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like him to grab me and tell me something 's wrong and get it over with , " she said . " He has problems expressing anger so he 'll bottle it up . Me , I 'm much more in touch with the things that upset me and much more comfortable expressing them , much to his dismay , I guess . " <p> Said Swanson : " I come from a family where men are supposed to take it and intellectualize . If the shoe was on the other foot , I would have laughed or looked the other way when the coffee maker came tumbling to the floor . My response would have been more protective of her . Her response was more parental than peer . " <p> They both decided they had handled that conflict poorly . But they used it as a learning tool . " I trust her now to deal with my anger , " Swanson said . " So , I 'll tell her , ' Hey , this is bothering me . ' At the same time she realizes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she must tread lightly in certain areas . " <p> " Two people who spend a lot of time together will always have a certain amount of incompatibility , " Swanson concluded . " It 's managing that incompatibility that counts . " <p> Husbands and Wives <p> Not all Americans say their marriages are perfect , but two-thirds of husbands and wives say that their relationships are at least " nearly perfect . " Still , about four in 10 say marital conflict often adds stress to their lives , according to a Washington Post/Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation/Harvard University survey of about 300 couples randomly selected from across the country . <p> Q : Which of the following best describes your marriage or current relationship ? <p> Among all husbands and wives <p> It 's perfect and could n't be improved 12% <p> It 's nearly perfect ; a few small improvements are needed 54 <p> It 's generally good ; but there are some problems 30 <p> It 's not so good , we 've got serious problems 3 <p> It 's in real trouble 1 <p> Q @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to do over , are you certain you would marry the same person , or is there a chance you might not ? <p> Women Men <p> Would marry same person 85% 88% <p> Might not marry same person 15 10 <p> Considering Divorce <p> Have you ever thought about getting a divorce ? <p> Women Men <p> Yes 27% 22% <p> No 73 78 <p> People were also asked whether they believed their spouses had thought about divorce . <p> Three-fourths of husbands and wives gave the same answer as their spouses <p> One fourth gave conflicting answers : <p> 14% worried their spouses had thought about divorce , when the spouses said they had n't . <p> 9% did not believe their spouses had thought about divorce , when in fact the spouses had . <p> Q : If you found out that your spouse was having an affair , would you leave your spouse and get a divorce , or not ? <p> Women Men <p> Yes 39% 37% <p> No 47 49 <p> No opinion 14 14 <p> Sources of Stress <p> American couples are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their relationships . About eight in 10 husbands and wives say they are satisfied with the amount of time they spend together as a couple , as well as the amount of time they have away from their spouse . <p> Couples with young children at home are somewhat less satisfied with the state of their relationships overall . <p> Husbands and wives rank the causes of life stress in a similar fashion , with a significant percentage saying that conflicts in marriage often contribute to stress . <p> Percentage who say each of the following causes stress in their lives " very often " or " somewhat often " <p> Women Men <p> Work-related pressure 57% 60% <p> Juggling commitments <p> between work and family 56 53 <p> Not having enough money 52 49 <p> Caring for children 54 42 <p> Conflicts in your <p> marriage/relationship 40 39 <p> Note : this series of questions was not asked of individuals over age 65 .
