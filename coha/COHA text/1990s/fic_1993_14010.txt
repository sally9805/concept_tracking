An unfinished basement in a working-class home in Providence , R.I. Architectural details are meager ; a few pipes , a water heater , a cement floor with a drain . There is an old cast-iron bed bolted to the floor , a small box refrigerator , a rocking chair and a stool . The only door has been framed with sheet metal with a viewing slot added . Beside the door is a speaker monitor . On the other side is an electronic keypad used to control access and egress from the inside by inserting a five-number code . In the room a sixty-five-year-old woman is finishing making the bed . She wears a housedress . The time is now . DU ( Singing the song K-K-K-Katy absently , her mind elsewhere . She finishes the bed and puts two pillows on it from the rocker . She starts the song again . The buzzer rings through the speaker monitor . Du moves to it and presses the button . ) Yes ? WALTER ( On the speaker . ) She 's here . ( Du stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's here . DU Yes . ( She pulls back the bedclothes neatly . Walter enters . He is a man of fifty , neatly dressed in inexpensive slacks , sport shirt and jacket . He wears a mask . He carries a suitcase which he places by the rocker . Du laughs. ) p. 3 WALTER I know . ( He looks over the room . ) You need to put yours on . DU ( Crosses to get her mask . ) I hope she 's not allergic . I scrubbed , but ( She gestures helplessly . ) Old basements uh you see . WALTER It 's fine . ( She puts on her mask . He moves to the door and speaks out it . ) WALTER Now , please . ( He re-enters . Moments later two men bring in a hospital gurney . On it is a young woman , early thirties , strapped in . She wears a hospital gown . She is unconscious . Over the foot of the gurney is a dress and , on it , shoes . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two men wear jeans and T-shirts or short sleeves . One is young ; one is n't . They pull the gurney parallel to the bed and unstrap it . They move the young woman onto the bed . One places the dress and shoes in the suitcase by the rocker . ) WALTER Thank you . ( One nods , neither speak . ) WALTER Please be at dispersal in twenty-three minutes , we are running seven minutes late . ( The two men look at their watches. ) p. 4 WALTER Seven twenty-two . ( One adjusts his watch . They take the gurney out and close the door . ) WALTER ( Speaks to Du . ) Is there anything needed ? DU ( Stands over the young woman , looking down . ) I do n't think so . WALTER The anesthesiologist says she might sleep through or she might not . ( Du stands looking at her . ) WALTER I 'll be back in four days . Someone will be upstairs . It went very smoothly and cleanly ; we have no reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he carries . ) Everything is here . Your husband wishes you well . Please memorize this .

( He suddenly leans forward and kisses her cheek . Du is surprised . ) WALTER We will prevail . DU I know . ( He goes out the door and closes it . Du inserts locking code into the keypad . A pause. ) p. 5 DU We 're fine . ( The viewing slot closes . Du turns , moves to the bed and takes the young woman 's pulse . She moves to the suitcase and opens it , taking out a fairly thick file folder . She thumbs through it . She finds what she is looking for . ) Right handed . ( She puts the folder in the bag and takes out a pair of chromed handcuffs . She goes to the bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the headboard . She makes sure this arrangement is comfortable for Keely . Now Du folds the clothes she has removed from Keely and places them back in the bag and re-zips it . Du goes to the bed and takes Keely 's pulse . Finished , she goes and checks the door and then moves to the rocker , where she sits watching the bed and its occupant . She sings " K-K-K-Katy , K-K-K-Katy " The Lights go down. ) @x Lights almost immediately up . Keely is moving . DU ( Experimentally . ) Keely ? ( Keely moves . ) DU Keely ? KEELY Ummmm . DU It 's all right , honey . Keely ? You 're all right , you 're just waking up . ( Nothing from the bed . Du sits a moment . She takes off her mask , thinks , puts it back on . ) Keely ?

KEELY I do n't know you . DU Well , I 'm easy to know . ( Keely drinks . ) DU Not too much now . ( She takes the cup . ) KEELY Thank you . DU You 're welcome . KEELY Dried out . ( Now aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll just come sit down with you KEELY What DU Right here .

( To Du . ) Who are you ? This hurts , it 's hurting me . Ow . Ow , ow . I ca n't stand this . ( She 's on her feet , yanking the cuffs , grabbing with her free hand . She tries to drag the bed . She tries to tip it over . She starts to cry out of frustration . She tries to go after Du , yelling . ) Let me go ! You better let me go ! p. 9 DU Please do n't hurt yourself . KEELY Get these off . My dad 's alone . He has to be fed . Do you understand that ? He ca n't move , do you hear me ? Come on , what are you doing ? Tell me ? What do you want me for ? Who do you think I am ? I 'm not anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Come on , I 'm not kidding . Listen , I got seventy bucks in the bank , I ca n't get laid off . ( Her diatribe becomes less and less controlled , builds to a peak and then declines into a beaten , exhausted silence that leaves her staring at Du , who sits in the rocker . ) KEELY Get this off me . I ca n't do this . Help ! Let me out ! Get me out of this . Do you hear me , are you deaf , or what are you , lady ? Help ! Help ! Help me , help me , help me ! ( She screams in rage and frustration . ) What are you ? Tell me what you want . Tell me what you want . Please , talk to me , talk to me . Please . Please . ( She stands , sweat pouring down her face , her voice hoarse , panting . She yanks against the cuff . She stands staring at Du . The lights fade. ) @x Lights up . Keely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a bucket of water a towel , washcloth and sponge . She puts the towel on the stool and the bucket on the floor . Keely sits bolt upright , startled . She stares at Du . DU Rise and shine , the British are coming . In the army my husband had a sergeant used to say that every six A.M. ! Heavens . Well would you like to wash up , Keely ? I hoped we 'd have a shower , but something about the pipes . ( Keely does n't respond . ) DU Are you a bath person or a shower person ? I was bath , but I changed over when I got so that I did n't like looking at myself You 're so aware of yourself in a bath , do n't you think ? Did you sleep at all ? Heavens , I do n't see how you could , I really do n't . ( Du reaches out to touch Keely 's shoulder , but she turns away . ) DU Keely ? KEELY Get away from me ! DU I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to me ! DU I thought you might want to wash yourself . KEELY You heard me ! DU ( Sits in rocker . ) You can tell me if you change your mind . ( Keely does n't move . The lights fade. ) @x In the dark , a tray falls . Lights up . Keely has knocked a breakfast tray presented by Du to the floor . DU ( Looking down . ) Well , honey , what is that ? What does that mean ? I would like you to keep my arthritis in mind when I 'm on my hands and knees cleaning that up . KEELY ( Eyes flaming . ) I 'll keep it in mind . DU You need to eat . KEELY I 'm not eating . DU Then they 'll feed you intravenously . Well , I 'm upset if that 's satisfying , I 'm not cleaning this up now . ( She sits in the rocker . She waits . Keely will not respond . ) DU No ma'am . No ma'am . Well , not everyone likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poached , and he 's still poached if you ask me . That boy was , is and will be a trial . It was his born nature and his grown nature , I swear I had no effect , bur that child can make you laugh ! Lordy . From this high . Three boys , and lived to tell the tale . Every single one of them on the basketball team , and if that 's not the dumbest human activity the mind could come up with , I do n't know what is . Run one way , put it in a hole , run the other way , put it in a hole . Lord have mercy . ( No response. ) p. 12 DU You can talk or not talk . You 'll be here almost five months , here in this room with me . How will we pass the time ? You have a special burden , I believe that . I would lift it from you if I could . You are not what I would have chosen , but wiser heads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll be having a baby ; perhaps we should start from there . ( Lights down. ) @x In the darkness we hear a buzzer . Walter , on the speaker : " I will be coming down . " Lights up . Du moves to the door , pushes the speaker 's button , and says : DU Yes ? WALTER I will be coming down . DU Yes . Good . ( She turns to Keely . ) I hope you are n't so angry that you ca n't listen because it would be important to listen now . Keely ? He is blunt spoken sometimes , and he is a man , do n't let that close your heart . Keely ? ( Du goes to the suitcase and puts on her mask . There is a light knock on the door . She goes to it and unlocks it . She opens the door . A man wearing a mask , dressed in a suit and tie enters with a briefcase . He speaks to Du . ) WALTER Good morning , sister . DU Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . He goes to the rocker and pulls it closer to Keely but still beyond her reach . ) Nana is taking fine care of you , I 'm sure . ( He looks at the tray on the floor . ) I see you 've had your breakfast . You seem alert and well . The anesthetic we used , 100 milligrams Ketamine , is very mild and will not harm the baby , we 're very sure of that . I know you have other concerns . Funds have been arranged for your father 's care . I wanted to reassure you . ( A pause . ) Will you talk to me at this point , Keely , or shall I just talk to you ? I know this must be hard to take in. p. 14 KEELY Who are you ? WALTER I am a member , Keely , of Operation Retrieval . We are a group of like-minded Christians motivated by a belief in the sanctity of life and the rights of unborn children . ( Keely puts her head in her hand . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to life-supportive principles as promoted by Hippocrates from 450 B.C. until the turn of the century . Since then , certain groups and individuals have been promoting death as a solution to social problems . I do not condone that . You are almost three month 's pregnant , Keely . KEELY I was raped . WALTER You were , Keely , and I find that horrifying . That a man you knew and cared for KEELY Wait a minute ; wait a minute . WALTER You are the injured party KEELY Yeah , right WALTER In God 's eye , and in ours KEELY And handcuffed , and kidnapped . WALTER but your unborn child is separate from that issue . KEELY No , it isn't. p. 15 WALTER It is a separate life which may not be taken to solve your very real problems . KEELY Hey , it 's cells , little cells . WALTER ( Very clearly . ) It is a separate life . KEELY And what about my life ? WALTER I need to clarify the situation for you KEELY ( Pulling on her restraint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are 1,500,000 abortion deaths on this planet each year , and that is spiritually unbearable . Now , you are one of four young women , geographically distributed , all with child , all seeking abortion , who have been taken into protective custody . Each of you sought out a clinic for different reasons and in different situations . There is , of course , a political dimension here . We chose you as a rape victim , Keely , Rape has always been understood as the extreme edge of abortion policy , and we must make clear that infant rights extend even into this catastrophic area . The rape victim must be given support on every level , but the fact of the child is critical . If medically we must lose or severely harm mother or child , we must choose . If both can survive , both must survive . We intend to document and assist these children 's lives , which would otherwise have been lost . p. 16 KEELY What do you mean , document ? WALTER Document , Keely . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Screw you people . I 'm not a goddamn teenager . You 're not God . I want an abortion ! WALTER Keely KEELY What do you want from me ? ! WALTER We want you to hold your baby . We will care for you here until the seventh month of your pregnancy and then return you home for the birth in the best medical circumstances . KEELY Oh , man . WALTER We assume the following responsibilities : all expenses relating to the birth of your child will be taken care of , adoptive parents eager to raise the child and capable of so doing will be in touch with you , should you decide to raise your child KEELY How the hell do you think I 'm going to do that , huh ? You knew I was pregnant , you knew I was raped , do you know I take care of my dad ? Do you know he 's paralyzed ? Do you know I hold his bedpan ? Is that part of what you know ? Do you know I work two jobs ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidy will be provided for the first two years , and there will be an education fund p. 17 KEELY What is your name ? What what who are you ? WALTER You 're going to be famous , Keely . You 're going to be a famous American . There will be many opportunities open to you and your child . This is difficult for you to understand , but your life has already changed for the better ( Keely laughs . ) WALTER I know it 's ironic . Are the handcuffs hurting you ? KEELY Yes . WALTER I 'm sure there is something we can do . Everything I know about you , Keely , and I know considerable , leads me to believe you will fall in love with your baby . KEELY My sister-in-law , she threw her baby on the floor . You think " in love with your baby " is all that 's out there ? WALTER It 's what should be out there . You are in your third month , Keely . Your baby is sensitive to the touch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist . KEELY You 're going to prison , mister . I 'll put you there . WALTER You may send me to prison ( He gestures toward Du ) we are both prepared for that spiritually and practically . We have committed our lives . What can I say to you ? I am a father , and caring for , learning from my children well , you would n't understand . They resurrected my life through our Lord Jesus Christ . p. 18 DU She 's exhausted . WALTER Keely , the abortion procedure you were seeking Wednesday morning is called Suction Curettage . A powerful suction tube is inserted through the cervix into the womb . The baby 's body and the placenta are torn to pieces and sucked into a jar . The baby 's head is crushed and then extracted . KEELY Screw off . WALTER It 's sometimes hard to recognize a friend at first , Keely , we need direction sometimes , we need people to tell us what to do when we act out of panic or confusion . I have limited your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step outside your runaway emotions . I will return your options to you when you are thinking dearly and ready for them . KEELY ( Indicating Du . ) She took off her mask , I 'll remember her . ( Walter looks at Du . A pause , and then he takes off his mask . ) WALTER There , now you 've seen us both . Hello . ( Keely does n't reply Du takes off her mask . Walter looks at her again briefly . He rises and moves to the door . ) WALTER I am a pastor if you wish counseling about your rape or your pregnancy . One of our doctors will visit you weekly . This lady is a registered nurse . ( A pause . ) You could be my daughter , Keely , and if you were I would do this for you . I 'll see about the handcuffs . Goodbye , Keely . ( He exits , closing the door behind him. ) p. 19 DU ( Goes to the door and locks it . Turning back , she cleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . ( Lights out. ) @x A tray crashes in the dark . Lights up . Du stands over another fallen breakfast . DU ( Looking down . ) My husband can eat the same breakfast one hundred times in a row . Goes the same route in the car to the same places . Buys the same color socks by the gross . He is very set in his ways . ( She kneels down and cleans up . ) Please talk to me . ( A pause . ) Please talk to me . ( A pause . ) My husband is n't much of a talker . Well , are they ever ? To us ? I do n't know . Oh , about some things . Not about others . I never could understand it . ( She pauses . Keely does n't reply . ) Now , Keely , truly , are we going to sit here like this ? You talked to him ; am I so much worse ? Well , he 's a good man if he does n't sound like one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he says where another man would swear ? Flub-a-dub-a-dub ! Right out in public . Flub-a-dub-a-dub . ( She laughs . ) KEELY Why should I talk to you ? ( Referring to the cuffs . ) Look at this . Why the hell should I talk to you ? DU ( She has finished cleaning . She looks at Keely . ) Because you have a life to lead , young lady . That is why " the hell " we should talk . And do n't play Miss Self-righteous with me , this is beyond that . None of this is going away , Keely . Deal with it . ( Keely stares at her , furious. ) p. 21 DU Foolishness . ( Lights out. ) @x The lights come up on Walter talking to Keely at the bed . She has her hands over her ears . Du stands somewhere above the bed . WALTER By twenty-five days , the developing heart starts beating ; by forty-five days , it has eyes , ears , mouth , kidneys , liver ; it has a brain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can hear me , Keely . KEELY No . WALTER Three months , right now , there is sexual differentiation . The baby sleeps and wakes and excretes and has vocal cords he even tries to use . KEELY You have no idea no idea WALTER At four months it has eyelashes and expressions you could recognize from your grandmother . KEELY Please stop talking . WALTER Why would n't you let the baby live , Keely ? You never have to see it again if that 's what you want . KEELY No . WALTER The baby is n't rape , Keely , the baby is a baby KEELY Please ( She starts to cry . ) WALTER Last year there were 700,000 people wanting babies who could n't get them listen to me p. 23 KEELY Do n't touch me . WALTER I know carrying this baby is difficult and emotional but , after abortion there are frightening side effects . KEELY Please WALTER serious depression , terrible guilt , mental illness , self destructiveness . DU That 's enough . WALTER Spare yourself , Keely , finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . KEELY Screw you ! WALTER ( Forcibly turning her face to his . ) Your mouth should be washed out with soap . DU That 's enough ! WALTER ( To Du . ) What are you doing ? DU I am suggesting that she is n't hearing you WALTER Yes ? DU They are important things , and we would want her to hear them . WALTER ( Coming hack to himself Understanding . ) Yes . DU That 's all I 'm saying . WALTER Thank you . p. 24 DU That 's all I 'm saying . WALTER Sometimes I do n't realize sometimes I am over-emphatic . ( To Keely . ) Please accept my apologies . ( He lightly touches Keely 's arm . ) That certainly wo n't happen again . ( She stares at him . ) WALTER I , umm I 'll be back this evening . DU I did n't WALTER Is there anything I can bring you ? ( No answer . ) WALTER Well , then ( He goes and collects his things . To Du . ) Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DU I just WALTER I 'm sorry , Keely . ( No answer . He leaves and closes the door . ) DU ( She goes to the door and locks it . She comes back and sits on the edge of the bed . ) I 'll just be here . I wo n't touch you . I wo n't say anything , I 'd just like to sit here . ( Lights down. ) @x Lights tip . Du is mopping the floor . DU so , the stock market crashed , three days later , there I was . The doctor asked my father what they planned on calling me " Calamity Jane , " he said . There were ten kids , I was the fourth . Would you like me to stop talking ? ( Keely shakes her head " no . " ) DU My mother , Jesus watch over her , died of leukemia at thirty-seven , leaving ten children , God help us , you can imagine . Well , God provides . I took care of the little ones , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So much to learn , such a stupid little girl . Thousands of meals I put together . Sometimes I would step into a closet for the peace and quiet . Oh , mercy ! Oh , my father was quiet , Lord he was silence in shoes , I mean it so tall he wore one suit , and he would move through the mess and noise and contention and tears , and he would pick up the fallen , dry the ones who were wet , find the lost and admonish the fallen away with an old wooden spoon . And then he 'd go and sit in the midst of the madhouse and read his Bible . When his eyes tired he 'd have me read it , on the floor beside him , one hand on my shoulder . You know , I remember a hundred things he did and nothing of what he said . He died of throat cancer , and he died so hard I do n't even like to think about it . ( A pause . ) What about your father ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Irritation . ) I think you 're spoiled rotten , what do you think ? You care for your father , and you think that 's hard ? It 's a privilege to do that , young lady . You work two jobs and think you 're put upon ? There are millions suffering because they ca n't provide . Your husband forced himself on you ? You should have gone to the police . You want to end the life of the baby you are carrying ? It 's contrary to God 's will , it 's murder , it 's not necessary , it 's as selfish an act as you could conceive , and we will not allow you to harm that child or yourself , You are better than that , you know you are , and how you feel or what trouble you might have is not so important as a life . Now grow up and talk to me . ( A pause . ) What about your father ? p. 26 KEELY My father ? He can move his right arm and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . KEELY He 's a cop who got shot during a drug bust . You mess with a cop 's daughter , they will skin you alive . DU I am truly sorry . KEELY You know what you get for kidnapping ? DU Well , not to the year I do n't . KEELY All you 've got left . All of your life . DU I 'm a Bible Christian , Keely , and you can have my life to stop the slaughter is my perspective , I suppose . Not that I could take the prison , Lord , I do n't even like low ceilings . I do n't know what I 'd do . But Isaiah 44:24 , " This is what the Lord says  --  your Redeemer who formed you in the womb : See , I set before you today life and prosperity , death and destruction , now choose life , so that you and your children may live .

I do n't have , you know , Bible reading to hold up . I 'm not some lawyer , all right , with this argument , that argument , put in this clause , fix the world . I ca n't do this , take care of my dad , get myself straight , take on a baby , I got , you know , nightmares , stuff like that , I see , whatsername , Princess Di , on some supermarket magazine , I 'm there crying , they have to call the manager , because what we 've got here , I could get messed up , who knows , killed by who impregnated me , not to mention I might , I do n't know , hate this baby , hurt this baby , throw the baby or something like that , I 'm not kidding , what 's inside me .

KEELY You 're sorry ? DU That was the act of an animal at that time . KEELY At that time ? You do n't know who he was , who he is . You do n't know who I am , and God knows you do n't care , with your scrambled eggs and your grandma act , either let me out of here or leave me alone , do you understand me ? I would n't eat I do n't know what if it came from your hands , I would n't touch it , I would n't let it inside me . You 're filth . I do n't care what church you come from or who your God is .
