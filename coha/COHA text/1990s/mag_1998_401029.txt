Your guide to the best times to fish // These charts were used for centuries by the ancient Polynesians , whose lives depended on their ability to catch fish . They knew that the biological clocks of all forms of life are inextricably connected to the cyclical relationships of the sun , moon and earth , thus enabling them to forecast the times of heightened activity for fish . How to Use the Charts Using the proper monthly chart ( see charts , following pages ) , look up the date when you will be fishing and make a note of the times indicated . Now locate your fishing spot on the map ( right . Identify the applicable time zone , and using the chart times for that day , add or subtract the number of minutes shown on the nearest vertical map line . For example : Lake McConaughy , Neb. , is located as shown on the map in the Mountain Time zone . The time correction for the nearest map line is minus 10 minutes . Therefore the corrected moon times for Lake McConaughy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Moonrise : 12:58 a.m. minus 10 min. = 12:48 a.m . Moonset : 03:33 p.m. minus 10 min. = 03:23 p.m . Moon Up : 08:15 a.m. minus 10 min. = 08:05 a.m . Moon Down : 08:43 p.m. minus 10 min. = 08:33 p.m . " Moon Up " indicates when the moon will be directly overhead I at the 12 o'clock position . " Moon Down " indicates when the moon will be directly underfoot . " Major Peak Periods " occur for approximately 1 1/2 hours on either side of Moon Up and Moon Down . " Minor Peak Periods " occur for about half an hour around moonrise and moonset . Also , all times are standard , so add one hour if daylight saving time applies in your area . Sunrise and sunset times are calculated at 40 degrees north latitude . // Find the spot you intend to fish on this map and use the correction for that time zone indictated on the nearest vertical line-as in the example for Lake McConaughy. // <p>           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
