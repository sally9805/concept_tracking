txt 50 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS CHANGING DEFINITIONS : WHAT IS IT ? Videotex initially had a very clear definition of being a home information service that used the telephone line for access , the home TV set for display , text and graphics in color , and information organized in a tree structure . Over time , the definition of videotex changed and broadened to include text-only information , full-motion graphics and video , and even conventional telephone service . By expanding the definition this way , the advocates of videotex never had to admit failure . If the past is prologue to the future , then we should soon see the superhighway ultimately defined to be the already existing telephone network and thus claim success . DIGITAL OVERLOAD The term " digital revolution ' is most certainly overused , particularly when most people probably have no idea what digital means . The concept of digital is decades old . In 1948 , Bell Labs ' scientists Bernard M. Oliver , John R. Pierce , and Claude E. Shannon invented the use of pulse code modulation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first implementation of their invention was in 1962 for the digital multiplex system known as T1 . Computers are digital machines ; people are not . People are analog creatures who read books and newspapers on paper , listen to music from loudspeakers and headphones , and watch videos on TV sets . All these media must create analog information for ultimate use by people . In our rush down the digital superhighway , we must not forget the human user . Markets are created by normal analog human beings , like you and me . Mass markets are rarely created by techies who embrace technology for its own sake . One example is the computer techies who seem to prefer to communicate with computers rather than directly with other human beings . But computer techies have created much of the interest about the superhighway . Guess now who is poised at the on-ramp ? ELECTRIC UTILITIES AT THE SUPERHIGHWAY ON-RAMP It seems that everyone wants to become involved with the information superhighway , and proposals are being made that electric utilities 5 . LESSONS FROM TODAY / 51 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the information superhighway and has suggested that the electric utilities should help build it . Indeed , electric utilities currently wire our neighborhoods and homes . But these wires carry electric power , and electric utilities know little of the two-way , switched nature of telecommunication signals . Electric power involves megawatts at kilovolts ; telecommunication signals involve milliwatts at millivolts . Electric power is transmitted at a single frequency of 60 Hertz ; telecommunication signals are sent at a wide range of frequencies from hundreds to billions of Hertz . Just because electric utilities string wire on poles does not mean they should be involved in telecommunication . I , for one , would not want the company that brought us the Three-Mile-Island incident to provide telephone or CATV service . The single frequency of 60 Hertz is about all they seem able to handle . Natural gas , water , and sewage are all carried over pipe . This does not mean that all three should be provided by the same company over a single pipe . But as we have seen , there is much nonsense along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine the success of today 's existing telecommunication infrastructure as a rejoinder to the hype of the superhighway . But before doing so , we will examine in detail the five factors needed for a successful venture . We will start with technology . TECHNOLOGICAL UNCERTAINTIES Technology is a key factor in suggesting and creating new options for the future . The recent success of the compact disc demonstrates the considerable impact technology can have on an entire industry in a very short time . The world of entertainment would be archaic without electronic television and its continued advances in technology . These dvances have made TV sets affordable to all . I can remember the first set that my parents purchased by monthly payments since it was so costly . Today 's TV set has a much better image , is far easier to tune , is considerably more reliable , and costs far less . It is tempting indeed to conclude that all sorts of new technological wonders will create the technological Utopia previously presented . However , although it is tempting to conclude anything is possible technology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF DREAMS the technology link needed to create market reality and a viable business venture . The next chapter explores these uncertainties . Chapter 5 TECHNOLOGICAL UNCERTAINTII Science fiction has created the widespread belief that almost anything possible technologically . I guess if we are willing to wait long enough most of these expectations will be fulfilled . However , from a real perspective , the technology must be available " off the shelf " if some product or service is to be provided today . We shall see in this chapter that there are many technological uncertainties that must be reso before the construction of the superhighway can begin . Many prom ( have ideas on how to solve these uncertainties , but commercial " of . shelf " solutions are not yet at hand . One must remember that fancy , ( brochures and plans on paper do not alone create reality . A HERTZ 'S A HERTZ AND A BIT 'S A BIT We saw in an earlier chapter that much of the superhighway resurrection of old ideas . In the early 1970s , it was first propose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? coaxial cable . This idea seemed sensible because all an signals occupy bandwidth , and once assigned an appropriate wide spectrum , many different kinds of signal could all be carried over same coaxial cable , under the philosophy that " a Hertz 's a Hertz . " combining of signals was to be accomplished through approp : frequency-division mutliplexing . The specific signals needed at home would be obtained through appropriate demultiplexing. return signals from the home would be multiplexed into approp channels on the cable for transmission back to the head end . 56 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS Today 's idea is to combine telephone service with television over a single broadband medium ? most likely optical fiber . This idea has developed because all signals can be converted to digital format and combined through time-division multiplexing , under the philosophy that all bits are the same , or " a bit 's a bit . " This idea of combining telephony service with television over a single medium failed in the 1970s and will most likely fail again because there is much more to the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A PICTURE 'S WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS One important difference between the video signals of television and the voice signals of telephony is bandwidth . As shown in the table , video requires about 1000 times the bandwidth of voice , regardless of whether the signals are analog , digital , or compressed . The old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words is confirmed . But capacity is only one dimension of the differences between television and telephony , and in particular , between CATV service and telephone service . CATV VERSUS TELEPHONY Television is a one-way medium . No matter how loudly you shout at TV set , your words will not be heard by the broadcaster . Telephone service is two-way . You both listen and speak . Telephone serviceinteractive in the sense that what you say affects another person then what they say to you in response . Television it 5 . TECHNOLOGICAL UNCERTAINTIES / 57 interactive ? unless clicking the remote to change a channel is broadly considered interactive . These and other differences are shown in the table below . figure Television is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one half hour in duration . Most telephone calls are short , usually a few mutes in length . The technical term for the length of a communication onnection is holding time . The same television signals are sent to veryone ; television is a broadcast medium . A telephone signal is connected to only one party ; telephony is a switched service . Everyone n watch television at the same time , and most people watch during the evening hours known as prime time . The telephone network is designed ho share resources among many potential users with the knowledge that ly a small percentage will want to use the phone at the same time . The only way in which CATV and telephony are similar at the local levle is in the medium used to carry the signals . Today , CATV uses the copper wire of coaxial cable , and the telephone uses the copper wire of fisted pair . In the future , both will increasingly use optical fiber . However , as we have just seen , there are far more differences than just a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 58 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS There is a last way in which CATV and telephony differ . The CATV firm controls both the conduit ? the cable ? and the content ? the TV programs sent over the cable . The telephone company owns and provides a switched , two-way conduit for communication but does not control , nor provide , the content of the communication . Indeed , the local telephone company is a monopoly , but the CATV firm is an even bigger monopoly . An even bigger monopoly could occur if the local telephone companies achieve domination over the provision of cable television while maintaining their control over the provision of local telephone service . The conclusion that I make is that the two services are so different that separate networks make good engineering sense . However , the transmission path might be shared in a common cable containing the twisted pairs of telephony and the coaxial cable of CATV or whatever the separate transmission media of tomorrow may be . FIBER TO THE HOME A few years ago , much media attention was attracted by the tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services , all in digital form . Voice , data , and video would be delivered to the home over the single , broadband medium of fiber . Thus , the concept of fiber to the home was invented , although it was simply a repeat of the promises of yesteryear 's broadband medium , namely , coaxial cable . A number of technical problems were discovered with bringing fiber directly to each and every home , and as a result , fiber has shrunk back away from the home . Fiber to the curb and then fiber to the neighborhood were the result . The next sections discuss the technological challenges and uncertainties of fiber in the local loop . THE DC BATTERY PROBLEM I recall attending a conference about six years ago at which a panel of experts was discussing the prospects for fiber to the home , or its unpronounceable abbreviation FTTH . The usual hype and futuristic promises from a convergence of telephone service and television on a single broadband medium were being presented . A person from the audience dropped the clinker by asking how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would he obtained , since optical fiber 5 . TECHNOLOGICAL UNCERTAINTIES / 59 does not conduct electricity . The look of outright surprise and puzzlement by most of the panelists said it all ? they had forgotten this little problem . Telephones require direct current ( DC ) to work . The direct current is created at the central office and is conducted over the twisted pairs of copper wire to homes and offices . In an emergency , large batteries at the central office take over and are able to power the telephone system for hours , until a diesel generator at the central office is switched into operation . The reliability of this power system is quite high , and we all can remember storms and earthquakes when the lights went out but the telephone still worked . There are technological solutions to the DC power problem . One obvious solution is to generate the dc at each home , or even at each telephone , by converting the 110-volt AC into DC , like the power adapter used for your telephone answering machine . The problem then is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not available , such as in an emergency . A battery backup could be used in the basement of each home for such emergencies , but then appropriate AC would be needed to charge the battery . Furthermore , rechargeable batteries ultimately wear out and would need replacement , thereby creating the question of who would be responsible for their replacement . Not only do telephones in the home need direct current , but the sophisticated electronics needed at each home to demultiplex television and telephone signals also require direct-current power . There are solutions to the DC battery problem . A system being developed by AT &T; sends direct current over coaxial cable along with TV and telephone signals . The sophisticated electronics in many of the new systems need to be protected from environmental hazards , such as heat , cold , and moisture . A solution is to bury the equipment in an underground vault , but even then , some protection in the form of air conditioning might be needed . But another big question is how to power this equipment and to protect it from power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AC of the local power company . But in an outage , back-up batteries will be needed , along with some form of small diesel generator . This power problem is solvable , but to do so is expensive . 60 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS NETWORK ARCHITECTURES AND TOPOLOGIES The telephone network uses centralized intelligence at the central office and robust , simple telephones connected to the central office by simple twisted pairs of copper wire . The CATV network is even simpler since the TV signals are sent in one direction down the coaxial cable and only need to be amplified along the way . A very inexpensive " tap " or connector is used to attach each home to the coaxial cable . The use of fiber for CATV avoids the cost of amplifiers , but the connection of each home to the fiber then becomes a very costly and complex affair . Similarly , extending multiplexing technology and intelligence from the central office for telephone service greatly increases cost and complexity of the overall system . How the network is configured to deliver telephone or CATV service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called a star network since each telephone is connected by its own dedicated twisted pair of wires to the central office . The CATV network is a tree network since the signals from the head end branch to each home . Computers are frequently connected to a single transmission medium in what is called a bus configuration . The topic of network configuration is known as network topology . The tree topology used for CATV is very simple and inexpensive . TV programs are multiplexed together at the head end and are then all sent down the coaxial cable . Along the way , the multiplexed signal loses amplitude and needs to be amplified every few thousand feet . Newer CATV system use optical fiber along much of the backbone to avoid these costly and sometimes noise-prone amplifiers . Homes are passed by the coaxial cable and are connected to it by very inexpensive connectors , called taps , that cost only a few dollars . A convertor box in the home selects and if necessary unscrambles the selected TV signal . The coaxial cable is a broadband medium and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are considering the use of compressed digital video so that more programs could be delivered over their existing cable . Some telephone companies are proposing a complete rewiring of the United States to deliver television over a totally new architecture and topology . In New Jersey , Bell Atlantic was granted regulatory relief in return for its promise to rewire the state with new digital network architecture . The question is how to marry the advantages of a tree topology for delivering TV to many homes with the star topology of individual 5 . TECHNOLOGICAL UNCERTAINTIES / 61 telephone lines for each telephone subscriber . One answer is the multiplexing of TV signals with telephone signals on the same transmission medium . If everything is converted to digital , then timedivision multiplexing is appropriate . However , the equipment needed to demultiplex and multiplex signals at the very high bit rates needed for hundreds of video and telephone signals is quite complex and costly . HYBRID FIBER COAX One solution is called a hybrid fiber coax ( HFC ) system , and AT &T; is pursuing this kind of approach in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to install the system for Pacific Telesis in California . In 1994 , Pacific Telesis predicted it would have 10,000 or more homes connected to HFC by the end of 1995 , a million homes connected by mid 1996 , and 5.5 million homes connected by the end of 1999 . These predictions have been overly optimistic , and by May 1996 , Pacific Telesis had connected 1200 homes in San Jose , CA in a technology trial of video over HFC with no commercial charges . Telephone service over HFC will come later . With the HFC system , shown in Fig. 5-1 , TV and telephone signals are carried over optical fiber from the central office to fiber nodes located in the neighborhood of customer homes . One optical fiber carries about 80 conventional analog TV signals . Two optical fiber pairs ( with one pair for redundancy backup ) carries digital telephone , data , and video signals . The TV and telephone signals are sent to the homes from the fiber node over a single coaxial cable shared by a few hundred homes . As many as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using about five coaxial cable buses . The connection of many fiber nodes to a single central office is a star topology and the coaxial cable network to the homes is a bus topology . The overall system is therefore called a star/bus topology . The HFC system is also being installed by Southern New England Telephone ( SNET ) in Connecticut . A few dozen homes are being tested in 1996 with about 1,000 to be connected by the end of 1996 . SNET predicts that the entire state will be HFC by the year 2009 . SNET has already applied for a CATV franchise for the entire state . FIBER TO THE CURB A so-called fiber-to-the-curb ( FTTC ) system manufactured by Broadband Technologies , Inc. and being installed by Bell Atlantic in Dover Township , New Jersey uses fiber to deliver telephone service and video to homes . The system , shown in Fig. 5-2 , provides 384 switched , compressed-digital TV channels , each at 6 Mbps using the MIF ( 1-2 compression standard . The TV signals are switched and combined with the telephone signals by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An HDT serves about 300 subscribers . Pairs of optical fibers carry the multiplexed signals from the HDT at the central office to optical network units ( ONUs ) with each ONU serving about eight homes . I ? ach home is connected to the pole-mounted ( ) NU by its own cable containing a coax for three digital video signals and five twisted pairs of copper wire for telephone and data service . Since all the fibers from the central office form a star topology and the cables from each ONU likewise form a star topology , the overall topology is therefore called a double star . I visited a Bell Atlantic demonstration facility in the Summer of 1995 and was convinced that the technology seemed real and at hand . Bell Atlantic told me that they expected to have 10,000 homes connected to it by the end of 1995 . By May 1996 about 5,000 homes were connected . There are problems though . Each ONU serves only eight homes and contains very costly technology , although neither Bell Atlantic nor Broadband Technologies would disclose the actual prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very costly system could ever compete economically with conventional CATV systems . Each ONU is connected all the way back to the central office by a pair of optical fibers and by a pair of copper wires for DC power . With 64 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS today 's twisted pairs of copper wire , about 10,000 pairs are connected to a typical central-office switching machine . The Bell Atlantic/Broadband Technologies ' approach simply replaces these twisted pairs of copper wire with pairs of optical fiber and heavy copper wires for power , although only about 1,000 pairs are needed . This is not an elegant solution . The key issue of most fiber-to-the-curb systems is their high cost . These criticisms of fiber to the curb were confirmed on my tour of the **28;91;TOOLONG installation in the Spring of 1996 . I was shown the Bell Atlantic central office as part of the tour . My initial response was horror when I saw the large frame of equipment needed to support all the fiber pairs and to perform the video switching . This frame of equipment was about 7 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fiber serving about 4,000 homes . A full installation to serve 10,000 homes will require about three of these large frames of equipment . It all looked extremely complex and costly to me , but clearly the equipment does work and is real . Interestingly , like the Pacific Telesis system in San Jose , the Bell Atlantic system is being used solely for video ? telephone service will come later . ASYMMETRIC DIGITAL SUBSCRIBER LINE Yet another approach is to use the existing twisted pairs of copper wire that are already in place . Twisted pair can carry as much as 6 Mbps over distances of a few miles , and most local loops are no more than a few miles from the central office . The approach , called asymmetric digital subscriber line ( ADSL ) , sends a 6 Mbps digital TV signal to the home along with conventional two-way voice telephony over a single twisted pair . The approach is simple and utilizes the existing local loop , but costly video switching for each loop is needed at the central office . ASDL is probably an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results of today 's trials . TOPOLOGY UNCERTAINTIES If you are like me , your mind becomes confused with all these different approaches and all their abbreviations and technical terminology . Which one is best ? How much will they really cost ? Are all the technical issues as resolved as the proponents of each one claim ? Many people already 5 . TECHNOLOGICAL UNCERTAINTIES / 65 complain about the price of today 's CATV service . Given the sophistication and complexity of all these new approaches , will anyone be able to afford tomorrow 's CATV service ? The high expectations of the phone companies to have 10,000 homes connected by the end of 1995 have already been greatly curtailed . I recall a study , done many years ago by Bell Labs when the world was analog , which concluded that the cost effective way to deliver both CATV and telephony was to use two separate networks : one using coaxial cable for TV and the other using twisted pairs of copper wire . There might however be cost savings if the coax and twisted pair shared the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be installed for Pacific Telesis in California . From solely the provision of telephone service , Pacific Telesis expects savings of about $50 per year per subscriber . However , the technology is sophisticated and costly , and we will need to wait and see what technical problems might arise with the various systems that are being installed . Today , the world is digital , and a fascination with video on demand has developed . What additional technological uncertainties are created when video on demand ? rather than conventional cable television ? is introduced ? VIDEO SERVERS A server is a computer that is attached to a network and performs functions that collectively benefit the various users of the network . Video on demand ( VOD ) and video dial tone ( VDT ) will require access to many videos by many users on a network . These videos will be stored in digital form and accessed by a video server . Thus , a video server is a device , probably some form of computer , that will store the videos and enable access by many simultaneous users . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even by today 's standards for technology . If a single video is stored in compressed form at 4 Mbps , then a two hour video will require a total storage of roughly 30 Gbits , or about 4 Gigabytes ( a byte equals 8 bits ) . To store 100 videos would then require 400 Gigabytes , or about one-half Terabyte ; 1,000 videos would require 40 Terabytes . Today 's hard disk technology stores in the order of a Gigabyte per platter , and a multi-platter hard drive could thereby store only about one video . One possible solution would be the use of a giant juke-box of video CDs , but 66 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS other problems remain . The problem of many simultaneous users who all want access to different portions of the video creates another challenge . Multiple heads could be used to allow access to each separate user , but physical constraints on the placement of the head mechanisms would probably limit the number of such users to about ten . What all this means is that the technology to allow hundreds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of videos simply does not exist today . There are ideas on paper about ways to develop such video servers , but commercial solutions are still far in the future . Video servers capable of handling a few hundred users and containing perhaps a hundred videos were promised for some of the video-on-demand trials , but the technology simply was not available . The trials have had to be postponed or other alternatives used , such as a bay of a few hundred VCR machines with a robot arm , or a high-school student , to load the requested videos . VIDEO SWITCHING Even if the video server problem were to be solved , the next challenge would be how to switch each video to each user . The switching machines in today 's telephone network are designed to switch speech signals at 64,000 bps , not video signals at 4,000,000 bps . Furthermore , the local switches are designed to handle only about 20 percent of customers simultaneously , which is why you have trouble obtaining dial tone during earthquakes and other emergencies when everyone tries to use the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during prime time , a video switching machine would need to handle 100 percent of the users simultaneously . Switching machines with the required capacity simply do not exist , and ideas on how to develop such machines are only now being designed on paper . In some respects , the electromechanical switching machines of the past were more appropriate for the bandwidths needed for video . These machines simply created a physical path through the switching machine by closing electrical contacts , and electrical contacts can easily accommodate the high bandwidths and bit rates needed for video . Today 's local , digital switching machines simply do not have the required capacity for video . Another unresolved question is whether circuit switching or pack 5 . TECHNOLOGICAL UNCERTAINTIES / 67 switching should be used . A number of technologists are promoting the use of packet switching in the form of the Asynchronous Transfer Mode , or ATM , which is a packet-switching technology allowing flexible packet lengths . Video has long holding times , unlike the short , bursty nature of most data traffic , and hence circuit switching might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technological uncertainty that must be resolved before the video switches required for video on demand are commercially available " off the shelf . " LANS AND ENGINEERING PRACTICE Local area networks , or LANs for short , are data networks that interconnect personal computers and work stations so that software and resources can be shared and messages interchanged . Early LANs used coaxial cable since it was thought that the large bandwidth and capacity of coax was needed . Later LANs used optical fiber which offered even greater bandwidths . An innovation in LAN technology was the use of twisted pairs of copper wire ! It was discovered that twisted pair was sufficient in terms of bandwidth and capacity for the short distances between personal computers all located in the same building or office . Furthermore , twisted pair was far less expensive as a medium . It is interesting when the use of old-fashioned existing technology is considered innovative , and this lesson should remind us that good engineering examines all alternatives from a number of perspectives , such as installation , user needs , maintenance , and cost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no place in sound engineering practice . DATA TRAFFIC The issue of network traffic has been controversial for decades . There are those who believe that data traffic will outstrip voice . Decades ago , such predictions were made and were incorrect . Today , such predictions are again being made and are used to justify broadband networks . In an attempt to bring reality to the issue , I performed a study a few years ago to estimate traffic for various services by quantifying each service in terms of total number of bits per year . The single largest yearly service was local and toll telephone traffic which in 1988 amounted to 14,000 x 10j5 bits for the United States . To estimate what e-mail and data 68 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS traffic might be , I assumed that all 120 million workers in the United States would access or create 200 screens of information per work hour . This came to only 300 x 1015 bits , much less than the traffic carried over the telephone network . Some proponents of broadband data communication criticized my findings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vast amounts of other data , between personal computers would create tremendous amounts of traffic . In response to their criticism , I estimated this traffic by assuming that 20 million personal computers would each transfer 20 Mbytes per day . This came to a yearly traffic of 1,200 x 1015 bits , still much less than the telephone traffic . According to my estimates , the only kind of traffic that would surpass telephone traffic would be switched video , such as the videophone or video dial tone . Facsimile has had great growth in the last ten years , but it is carried over the telephone network along with voice signals . Much late night international traffic carried over the telephone network is most likely facsimile . In a later chapter , we will discuss the Internet and the packet-switched data signals that it carries . Such data traffic is minuscule , though , compared with the traffic carried over the switched telephone network . DOWNLOADING Many years ago while I was at AT &T,; a colleague was squirreled away in his office working diligently on his new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines . I performed a back-of-theenvelope calculation and concluded that it would take over 40 hours to download one hour of CD quality music at 30 kbps , a fairly fast rate for a regular telephone line . Clearly , my colleague 's idea was not practical . Yet the idea of downloading video , which would require more capacity and time than audio , has surfaced . What continues to be forgotten is that the least costly way to deliver vast amounts of information is physically , such as a compact disc or a video tape or a newspaper . A network with electronic delivery is required only for timely information , and broadcasting the information is far less costly than a switched two-way network . 5 . TECHNOLOGICAL UNCERTAINTIES / 69 ANYTHING 'S POSSIBLE ON PAPER There will be those who will claim that they have solutions to all the technological uncertainties that I have listed in this chapter . But their solutions will frequently be ideas that thus far are only on paper .

Indeed , nearly anything is possible and solvable technologically , but ultimately there is a cost associated with technology . For example , the rewiring of the Nation proposed by many of the Baby Bells to bring us more TV programs utilizes very costly technology and does little more than conventional CATV . Will the service be affordable to consumers ? Who will finance the required investment ? These questions bring us to the next chapter in which we examine the financial viability of the superhighway . Chapter 6 FINANCIAL VIABILITY Ultimately someone must make a buck for any product or service to be successful in the real world . The financial investment required to create the infrastructure needed for the superhighway is quite large .

The following table gives industry revenue for 1993 resemebled from data reported in the Statistical Abstract of the United States 1995 . Telecommunication is the largest segment of the communication industry and is nearly twice as large as any other segment . The $48 billion in revenue generated by motion pictures includes $6 on from movie ' theaters and $7 billion from tape rentals , indicating extent to which tape rentals have grown in a short few years . The sale 72 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS of television equipment was $15 billion . Half of the $27 billion from CATV came from basic service ; pay-per-view and premium generated only about $5 billion . The newspapers , periodicals , and books produced by the publishing industry rival the revenues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and generated $8 billion of the audio industry revenue . Most of the revenue of the personal computer industry came from the sale of equipment . Physical delivery generated as much revenue as the entire publishing industry . Segment Some interesting observations and conclusions follow from the above table . The total revenue of the CATV industry is considerably 6 . FINANCIAL VIABILITY / 73 lower than that of the telephone industry , and the revenue generated from premium CATV is comparatively small . Why then is the telephone industry interested in CATV ? It would make much more sense for the CATV industry to provide telephone service , since telephone service generates considerable revenue and thus is a much larger target . The conventional accepted wisdom is that the revenue is in content and not in the conduit . Yet , the provision of telephone service , which generates no revenue from the provision of content , generated over half as much revenue as content-based cinema and television . Perhaps what this really means is that the provision of content is central to entertainment media , such as motion pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other segments of the communication industry . LESSONS FROM THE FINANCIALS The financial performance of a company is summarized in its consolidated statement of operations . Revenues and various expenses are deducted to determine the final profit , as shown in the table below . Deductions are shown in parentheses . Cash flow is sometimes called 74 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS EBITDA , for Earnings Before Interest , Taxes , Depreciation , and Amortization ; it equals revenues less direct expenses . Operating income equals EBITDA less depreciation and amortization . Pre-tax income equals operating income less interest and any miscellaneous revenues and expenses . These items are frequently expressed as percentages , or margins , on revenue . We will now compare the financials for a selection of media and telecommunication firms , including AT &T,; Bell Atlantic , TCI , Time Warner , and TCA . AT &T; is the former owner of the old Bell System and today provides long distance service , mobile telephone service , and manufactures various telecommunication and computer equipment . Bell Atlantic is one of the so-called Baby Bells . Tele-Communications , Inc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . At the end of 1995 , TCI supplied cable television to 12.5 million subscribers . Time Warner Inc. is a large multi-media company publishing various magazines ( such as Time and People ) and recorded music . Time Warner Entertainment Company , L.P. ( TWE ) was spun off from Time Warner , although Time Warner still owns 63 percent , and provides filmed entertainment ( Warner Bothers ) , television programming ( HBO ) , &; CATV . TCA Cable TV , Inc. is the 17th largest multiple system operator ( MSO ) , with 57 CATV systems and 580,000 subscribers . TCA provides CATV service mostly to areas that are not covered by conventional broadcast television , and thus TCA 's markets have a higher penetration of CATV subscribers than in those markets served by over-the-air broadcast signals . The table on the next page summaries the 1995 financial performance in terms of margins on revenue for selected media and telecommunication firms ranked by profitability . More detailed financials for these and other telecommunication firms are given in appendix B to this book . The bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are quite profitable with comparable profit margins of 16% and 14% respectively . TCI operated at a net profit margin of only 1% in 1994 , after having net losses in 1993 , 1992 , 1991 , and 1990 , although the size of these losses has steadily decreased . The reason for this low profitability is that in 1994 TCI paid nearly 16% of its revenues as interest versus TCA and Bell Atlantic which paid only 7% and 4% , respectively . Clearly , TCI is a debt ridden company without the profits to reduce its heavy debt . What is truly baffling is that in 1994 Bell Atlantic attempted to acquire The 6 . FINANCIAL VIABILITY / 75 acquisition of TCI 's debt surely would have reduced the financial success of Bell Atlantic . The only apparent rationale for the ill-fated merger was Bell Atlantic 's belief in the hype of the highway of dreams . Anyone who understood the negative implications of the financial aspects of this merger sighed with relief when the deal fell through . The above table shows how different some of these firms are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a telephone company or a small CATV company can be very profitable and successful . Bell Atlantic and TCA are money-making machines , with high cash flows , low interest , and healthy profit margins . However , being a large CATV company or a multimedia company is not necessarily very profitable . However , an extremely large CATV company ( such as TCI ) can generate considerable cash flow , although large payments of interest to service large amounts of debt greatly shrink the income . The multimedia company Time Warner clearly is having financial difficulties . TWE was spun off a few years ago to attract new partners , such as US WEST , Inc. ( 25.5% ownership ) , ITOCHU Corporation ( 5.6% ) , and Toshiba Corporation ( 5.6% ) . I lowever , TWI : is not performing that well either.The problem at both ' Dime Warners seems to be very high operating 76 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS expenses along with large interest payments . In 1993 , Bell Atlantic and TCI had quite similar cash flows and operating margins , but then the similarity suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TCI pays considerable interest on much debt . TCI thus is a highly leveraged company . Bell Atlantic was wise to cancel its planned acquisition of TCI , since Bell Atlantic would have dramatically and negatively changed its financial profile with this acquisition . The table further educates us about the pitfalls of manufacturing by showing the financial performance for AT &T.; Since AT &T; had pre-tax business-restructuring and other charges of $7.8 billion for 1995 , the financial performance for 1994 is used as being more typical . AT &T's; cash flow margin for 1994 was considerably lower than the cash flow margins for Bell Atlantic and the two CATV firms analyzed previously . The other margins are roughly half those for Bell Atlantic and TCA . The reason for this is that AT &T; is a diversified company with a large manufacturing component , and manufacturing traditionally has very tight margins . Although AT &T's; long distance business probably has very good margins , its cellular business obtained through the acquisition of McCaw Communications has most likely not been a strong positive factor on its overall margins thus far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former owner , one wonders why the Baby Bells ever wanted to be allowed into manufacturing , unless they are looking for ways to lose money . Many of the Baby Bell new ventures have not been great money makers . Another measure of financial performance is return on investment , or ROI . The return is profit either before or after taxes . The investment is assets minus liabilities and is also known as shareowners ' equity . For 1994 , the return on investment for AT &T; was 26% ; for Pacific Telesis , 22% ; and for TCI , 1.6% . One problem with return on investment is that it can be inflated if a company , like a telephone company , owns much plant and depreciates it slowly thereby increasing the value of its assets . Furthermore , return on investment will be deflated if a company has much debt , like TCI . Thus , return on investment can be a useful measure for comparing companies in identical businesses , but return on investment is not illuminating when used as a measure of comparison for companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a basis for regulation of telephone companies , but has been 6 . FINANCIAL VIABILITY / 77 replaced by caps on the prices charged to customers , subject to incentives for improvements in productivity . HOW 'S THE OLD BELL FAMILY DOING ? Appendix B gives the 1995 financial performance in terms of margins on revenue for each Baby Bell and also for AT &T; for 1994 . As before , cash flow equals revenues less direct expenses ; operating income equals cash flow less depreciation and amortization ; and pre-tax income equals operating income less interest and any miscellaneous revenues and expenses . The Baby Bells main source of income is their monopoly provision of local telephone service , and one would expect their performance to be similar . However , NYNEX 's performance is clearly below average . AT &T; has a large manufacturing business in addition to its provision of long-distance service , and all aspects of AT &T's; business are subject to intense competition . Not surprisingly , AT &T's; 1994 performance does not even come close to the performance of an average Baby Bell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes GTE , now the largest regional operating company . GTE had revenues in 1995 of nearly $20 billion making it larger than the closest Baby Bell , namely Bell South , which had 1995 revenues of nearly $18 billion . About one-fourth of GTE 's business is in providing local telephone service internationally , which makes GTE somewhat different than the typical Baby Bell . Regulators have traditionally regulated the return on investment of local telephone companies . However , the level of investment depends on depreciation and other discretionary factors . The financial community looks more strongly at margins on revenues , which is why the preceding analysis also uses such margins to examine financial performance . A measure of performance traditionally used in the telephone business is productivity , which is measured as the number of access lines per telephone employee . The table on the next page gives this measure as reported by each of the seven Baby Bells , although I worry that the criteria to identify and count telephone-related employees might not be identical for each . However , I have performed my own estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proportion of network revenue to total revenue , and my rankings are nearly identical to the Baby-13e11 reported figures . 78 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS One of the Baby Bells with the highest productivity is Pacific Telesis . This is the result of two factors : an intense campaign to reduce its number of employees and its divestiture a few years ago of nontelephone related business . Ameritech has the highest productivity , perhaps because of the seven Baby Bells , Ameritech has been most focused on its core telephone business . NYNEX 's poor financial performance is clearly related to its low productivity and indicates that NYNEX still has too many employees . The significant difference in productivity between Pacific and SBC , and between Bell Atlantic and NYNEX , raises questions about the outcome of these two mergers . Executive pay has become a touchy topic recently . Although NYNEX 's financial performance in 1994 was far below the other Baby // which was exceeded only by SBC Corporation 's chairman who received $1,952,000 . In 1994 , Pacific Telesis showed excellent financial performance and the best productivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was the lowest pay of the seven Baby Bells . The Baby Bells make most of their profits from their provision of basic telephone service , which is a utility business . One would perhaps expect that their chief executives would receive pay similar to that of other utility companies . Such large power utilities as Pacific Gas and Electric , Con Ed , and Public Service Electric and Gas each paid their chairmen less than $1 million in 1994 . Why then are most of the Baby 6 . FINANCIAL VIABILITY / 79 Bells paying their top executives such large amounts ? What is most illuminating about these financials ( see Appendix B for details ) is that in 1995 the seven Baby Bells had aggregate profits of $11.8 billion on an aggregate revenue of $91.6 billion . The Baby Bells generously pay a large percentage of their profits as dividends to their shareowners , actually as much as 80 percent for some . If the Baby Bells were to reduce the dividend pay-out ratio to 50 percent , t /tey collectively could have nearly $6 billion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collective financial power . But their track record at investing in new ventures has not been very successful , justifying the term " Baby Bells in the woods . " WHERE ARE THE PROFITS ? In early 1995 , I attended a financial conference at which Sprint presented very interesting data about the 1994 operating margins for its various businesses . Cellular and wireless had an operating margin of 14% ; long distance was only 9% ; and local service was 23% . The Sprint operating margin for local service is very similar to the operating margins for the Baby Bells and GTE . The surprise in the Sprint data is that the provision of local telephone service is such a great financial success ? more so than cellular or long distance for Sprint . It also becomes clearer why GTE sold Sprint and abandoned the long distance business . Perhaps the real cash cow is the provision of local telephone service . This conclusion is enough to create curiosity about how well the various new business ventures of the Baby Bells are performing financially . BABY BELL NEW VENTURES Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profitability of new ventures . It presented the financial and operating results for Pacific Telesis ' new ventures for 1990 through 1992 . Pacific ' Telesis International ( PTI ) operated cellular and paging systems in Germany , Portugal , Spain , Thailand , and Japan . PTI had a net loss for all three years with an accumulated loss of $93 million on accumulated revenues of only $78 million . PacTel Teletrac , a joint venture providing vehicle location service , also had net losses for the three years with an accumulated net loss of $78 million . Only PacTel Cellular and PacTel 80 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS Paging had net profits for the three years : a total accumulated net income of $312 million on accumulated revenues of $2,106 million ? a hefty profit margin of 15% over the three years . However , the analysis for 1992 presents a negative picture : $82 million net income for PacTel Cellular ; $16 million net income for PacTel Paging ; a net loss of $33 million for PacTel Teletrac ; and a net loss of $46 million for PTI . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only $19 million . In 1994 , Pacific Telesis wisely divested all its paging and cellular ventures into a new company called AirTouch Communications . US WEST , through TeleWest Communications , offers combined telephone/CATV service in the United Kingdom . The US WEST investment in TeleWest since 1989 has been $420 million , but in 1994 the UK telephone/CATV business had a loss of ? 58 million on revenues of ? 72 million , which is an increase over the losses of the previous years , although revenues have been increasing also . US WEST 's cellular subsidiary had a cash flow margin of 28% for 1994 , which is far below the overall cash flow margin of 42% for US WEST as a whole . What all this means is that many of US WEST 's ventures are either outright losers or , at best , drains on the overall profitability of the company . INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT A few years ago , studies mostly financed by the Baby Bells concluded that the telecommunication infrastructure in the United States had fallen behind other industrialized countries . Anyone who has visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the best , if not the best , telecommunication systems . Clearly , the studies were flawed and were little more than a thinly disguised attempt by the Baby Bells to justify less regulation to allow them to rewire the country . The fact is that telecommunication companies in the United States already invest heavily in improving and maintaining their networks . CATV companies and phone companies need to spend constantly in upgrading and maintaining their network infrastructures , and in this way , both industries are similar . For example , in 1993 Bell Atlantic spent $2,519 million , or 19 percent of its revenues , in upgrading and maintaining its telephone network . Also in 1993 , TCI spent $947 million , or about 23 percent of revenues , in upgrading and maintaining its CATV network . The investment needed for the video superhighway , however , would dwarf these figures . 6 . FINANCIAL VIABILITY / 81 The estimates of the investment needed to rewire each home for the video superhighway range from $500 to $2,000 . Let us assume an inbetween estimate of $1,000 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rewiring the 100 million households in the United States would then require an investment of $100 billion , which is nearly half/the value of the present local telephone system , which took over 10G years to create . Assuming an interest rate of 15 percent and a 20-year equipment life span , this level of investment is equivalent to $16 billion per year . Even the Baby Bells do not have these kinds of resources . ACCESS CHARGES : THE FINANCIAL GLUE OF THE TELECOMMUNICATION INDUSTRY Before the Bell breakup , whenever you made a long distance call about 60 to 70 percent of the charges were returned to the local telephone company as a form of subsidy to keep local rates low and to make telephone service affordable . After the Bell breakup , this subsidy has continued but is now justified as a reimbursement to the local company for the use of its local facilities to complete the long distance call . The reimbursement is known as an access charge . Long distance companies pay the local phone companies at each end of a call for access . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $3.50 per month for access . This user access charge is really an increase in local rates that is disguised by the local phone companies as some form of mysterious , FCC imposed charge . My guess is that some people believe that the fee goes to the FCC rather than directly to the local telephone company . In a way , the access charges paid to the local companies are like a divorce settlement . The access charges paid by long distance companies to the local phone companies are quite large and are a form of glue that keeps the old Bell System together financially . In 1993 , 24 percent of Bell Atlantic 's total revenues came from access charges , thereby making long distance companies Bell Atlantic 's biggest customer . In 1994 , AT &T; paid 41 percent of its revenues from the provision of long distance service in access charges and other interconnection charges . Thus , the local telephone companies , though currently forbidden from providing longdistance service , receive about 40 percent of long distance revenues because of access charges . These charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid 57 percent of its long distance revenues in access 82 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS charges . Over this eleven-year period , AT &T's; long distance revenues increased only 20 percent . In 1994 , 25 percent of the total revenues of the Baby bells came from the collection of access charges . Indeed , local phone companies need to be reimbursed for local access , but , making an honest determination of what these charges should be , is another matter . The local companies have a monopoly on local access and are a bottleneck to local access . The AT &T; acquisition of McCaw 's cellular business gives AT &T; a detour around the local companies . One can imagine AT &T; giving a lower long distance rate to its McCaw customers , who use the cellular connection as a direct route to AT &T's; long distance network , thereby bypassing the local phone company entirely and saving on any access charges . One phone company response to this bypass is to increase local rates to its remaining customers , so that the end result is revenue neutral to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone companies is to clamor to be allowed into long distance service itself . The Telecommunications Act of 1996 indeed allows the local telephone companies into long distance . As the largest provider of long distance service in the United States , AT &T,; through its payment of access charges to the local phone companies , is their single largest customer . In return , the local phone companies purchase AT &T; switching machines and are as a group AT &T's; largest customer . AT &T; and the Baby Bells are still intimately intertwined financially , although like parties in a divorce , they are battling more and more . AT &T; will spin off its manufacturing into a new operation , called Lucent Technologies . This will eliminate the customer/supplier relationship between the Baby Bells and AT &T; in the purchase and sale of switching machines , but now AT &T; and the Baby Bells will battle even more fiercely over long distance . INTERNATIONAL CALLING When you make an international telephone call from the United States , you are most likely subsidizing the telephone system or government of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling from the United States to most countries are much lower than the reverse rates for calling to the United States . In fact , in 1993 , over twice as many calls are made internationally from the United States than to the United States . This in itself is not a problem , but the way the costs of an international 6 . FINANCIAL VIABILITY / 83 call are shared creates an inequity . The process of computing tl/ese shared costs is called settlements . The settlement rate is shared equally between the two countries for an international call , and if traffic were equal , there would be no net flow of money . However , given the inequity in origination of international calls and also the artificially too high settlement rate , a large imbalance occurs . In 1993 , this imbalance was $4 billion from the United States and is growing . Many countries view this imbalance as a cash cow generating funds that can be used by the government for any purpose and thus are very reluctant to renegotiate the settlement rate to more accurately reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In many ways , the settlement rate is like the access charges charged to long distance companies . USAGE SENSITIVE PRICING Local telephone calls are usually free within a basic flat rate . This creates false economics when it comes to data traffic for which long connect times are involved . Long distance companies pay about 3 cents per minute to both the originating and terminating local phone companies for local access . If all local calls were charged similar rates , an hour of local connection would be priced at about $2 . We shall see in a later chapter how flat rates for access to the Internet create a subsidy to high volume users . The Internet and its precursor , the ARPANET , were subsidized by the federal government for over two decades . Commercial public data networks , which can not afford to subsidize users , charge for both connect time and the amount of data . PRODIGY : A FINANCIAL ANALYSIS IBM Corporation and Sears , Roebuck and Co. launched an electronic information service called PRODIGY ? a few years ago . The service was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop . It was further reported that in early 1995 the service had about 1.3 million paying users and about 750 employees . This is enough data to perform a rough financial analysis of Prodigy . The initial investment needs to be recovered with an adequate return . Assume that the initial investment was an average of the upper and lower estimates , or $750 million . Assume further that this initial 84 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS investment should be recovered over a period of 15 years with a return of 15 percent . This would require $128 million yearly . A recovery over a shorter period of 10 years at a higher rate of 20 percent would require $179 million yearly . This tells me that a business person would want Prodigy to generate profits in the order of $150 million yearly to recoup the original investment and generate a reasonable return . Prodigy 's income stream comes mostly from the monthly rates paid by its subscribers . Assume that each subscriber generates $13 monthly in income from all sources . With 1.3 million subscribers , this amounts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has loaded costs of $130,000 a year . The 750 employees thus create an expense of about $100 million . Additional expenses would be incurred for advertising , billing , maintenance , rent , and operations . Assume that these other expenses double the employee expense thereby giving total operating expenses of $200 million . These expenses would exactly balance operating revenues . Prodigy would thus not generate profits on an operating basis , and most certainly would not be generating enough profits to pay back the original investment . Prodigy clearly became a financial disaster for IBM and Sears . IBM and Sears must have had much faith and hope for the future to continue in the venture , although once the initial investment was made there seemed little that could be done to recoup it . It seemed that as long as Prodigy was not losing money on an operating basis , nothing much was lost by continuing a little longer . But faith frequently loses to reality , and IBM and Sears looked to dump Prodigy . In May 1996 , Prodigy 's management , with financial backing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported to be worth nearly $200 million . Given the fast growth of Internet suppliers and decreasing subscriber base to Prodigy , one wonders whether the new Prodigy owners will have much success . IBM and Sears , however , lost their shirts , and clearly a few $100 million is better than nothing . THE BELL ATLANTIC/TCI MERGER : A FINANCIAL ANALYSIS In early 1994 , the proposed acquisition of the CATV-giant TCI by Bell Atlantic came unraveled . The purchase price was never very clear but seemed to be at least $2,000 for each of TCI 's CATV subscribers . Assume that this $2,000 is an initial investment which must then he repaid and must also generate an adequate return . For a high-risk investment such 6 . FINANCIAL VIABILITY / 85 as this , a return of 20 percent over a period of 15 years would seem appropriate . Each CATV subscriber would need to generate profits of $35 per month to create such a return . The average CATV subscriber bill in 1994 was $33 per month . Since there are such costs as content , billing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of return just mentioned could only be generated by a substantial increase in CATV billing to perhaps $70 per month . Such a huge increase clearly would be impractical . The Bell Atlantic merger with TCI made no sense financially , as we already saw earlier , based on the differences in overall financial structure of the two companies . BANDWIDTH COSTS MONEY In a previous chapter on technology we saw that with optical fiber , bandwidth is virtually unlimited . This tremendous capacity has lead some experts to conclude that bandwidth will be essentially free in the coming world of the superhighway . In my view , this conclusion is flawed . Although tremendous amounts of bandwidth are now available in most telecommunication networks , bandwidth is not free . A large investment in technology has been required to install the transmission media that contain such bandwidths . Bandwidth in transmission media can be used to carry a variety of different services , with different services requiring different bandwidths , or capacities . How these different services are priced relative to each other can not be ignored . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission medium that can carry both digital telephone signals at 64 kbps per channel and digital TV signals at 1.5 Mbps . What this means is that 24 telephone channels could be placed in the capacity of one TV signal . If the common carrier charges considerably less than 24 times the telephone service for the TV service , an entrepreneur could purchase capacity at the TV rate and then provide telephone service at a lower price . This would undercut the telephone service provided by the common carrier who would then need to increase the TV rates in an attempt to achieve equilibrium . Bandwidth can not be divided without consideration to its economic value . 86 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS TV VIEWER MARKET SHARE As a market is divided again and again , the size of each segment is greatly reduced . For example , with 500-channel television , the average number of viewers for each channel would be 1/500th the total number of viewers . If each individual program cost $500 thousand to produce and distribute , then all 500 channels would need to generate $250 million per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , this amounts to a yearly revenue requirement of one trillion dollars ( or $1,000 billion ) . Clearly this makes no sense . The basic economic fact is that as the market is divided more and more , there is less and less money available for quality programming . One possible outcome is that quality programming would disappear . Another outcome is that the same program would be sent over a number of channels with each channel starting the program delayed 10 minutes or so . This would allow the viewer to watch the program whenever the viewer wanted to rather than at a fixed schedule . Such a scheme has been called " near video on demand . " TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND PRICE Indeed , technological innovation has greatly improved our lives . Technological innovation in electronics and in telecommunication has not only resulted in improved performance but also in much lower prices to consumers . I recall as a child that my parents purchased their first TV set on time since it was so very costly . Today 's TV set is priced much lower even without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliability , and quality . Video on demand might eliminate the need for a trip to the video store to rent a video , but the real question is how much this convenience is worth to the consumer . It might be that the trip to the video store is an excuse to leave the home and is not the inconvenience that is assumed . But , if video on demand is an improvement , perhaps it should follow the usual course of technological innovation in telecommunication , and cost less than renting a video from the video store . However , the promoters of video on demand assume that consumers will pay a premium . This assumption might be false . In the present chapter we have seen that there are many financial uncertainties and difficult financial issues that make the future of the 6 . FINANCIAL VIABILITY / 87 information superhighway very unclear . However , in the end these financial issues become intertwined with consumers and their needs . This then brings us to a host of questions about consumer acceptance and consumer need for the various services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers will be willing to pay for them . These are the topics of the next chapter . Chapter 7 CONSUMER NEED Technology is only successful if it satisfies the actual needs of real consumers . Decades ago , AT &T; discovered that all the promotion in th world could not convince most people that they needed a picturephone Technology offers ? but consumers decide . The present chapter discusses the consumer considerations am reactions that will shape the future of the telecommunication superhighway , giving examples from today . One example is caller-IL and the surprise of negative consumer reactions to it . The chapter end with some general background on the various means for determining consumer needs and their reactions to new products and services . CONSUMER NEEDS We already know that people have many needs , some more basic than others . People need shelter , food , and clothing . Although a tent of tree branches might have been adequate for our ancestors , many of us need large , fancy houses in specific neighborhoods , with rooms that might bi used only an hour a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin might have been adequate clothing for our ancestors , at entire fashion industry has developed to convince us that we need thi : season 's newest fashion rage to feel pleased with ourselves . So , the means for fulfilling these three simple basic needs have evolved into today 's large industries that convince and entice us to purchase their products and services . People have other needs too . We need security and means o 90 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS transport also . While we each might have carried a sword or other form of weapon not that long ago , such individualized security measures are today frowned upon and instead society hires police to secure our property and selves . The horse and buggy has become the automobile , but the automobile has evolved far beyond simple basic transportation to encompass style and status . We need to be entertained . Songs and stories around the fire that created a feeling of shared community have become variety shows and soap operas viewed on the TV set . These general needs are interesting to list and think about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the future . We need to be more specific . As an example , consider our need for privacy ? the need to protect the inner self . CALLER-ID Caller-ID is a service that allows you to know the telephone number of the caller before you answer the telephone . Caller-ID is based on technology known as signalling system 7 ( or SS7 for short ) that sends the telephone number of the calling party over the telephone network . The telephone number is then sent down your telephone line as a short burst of data before you answer the phone . The telephone company was convinced that many people would like to know who was calling before answering the phone . After all , who would open the front door without first knowing the identity of the person ringing the door bell . You can well imagine the surprise of the telephone company when people objected to the service , claiming that the privacy of their telephone number would be violated . In hindsight , this should not have been such a large surprise , since in many big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone number . A few years ago , I did a study that also helps illuminate the issue of caller-ID from a consumer perspective . My study questioned 43 graduate business students to determine their ratings of concern on a scale ranging from 0 to 5 ( with 0 being " no concern " and 5 being " very concerned " ) for a variety of communication situations . " Not knowing who is calling before answering the telephone " received an average rating of only 0.9 . " Your telephone number is displayed to the person you are calling " received a much higher rating of 2.5 . What this means is that the solution ? caller-II ) ? is of far greater concern than the problem it would solve , namely , not knowing who is 7 . CONSUMER NEED / 91 calling before answering the telephone . As a result of this consumer concern over caller-ID , some telephone companies have been required to give consumers an option to block the forwarding of their telephone number . Other telephone companies , feeling that administrating the blocking option was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service areas . Today some telephone companies charge for blanket caller-ID blocking on all calls , while others offer blanket blocking for free . We are thus starting to find significant differences in the nature of telephone service in different parts of the United States . INFORMATION SERENDIPITY I read the newspaper mostly for enjoyment , not to find specific facts or articles . I really do not know what information I am looking for . I read the L. L. Bean and other catalogs similarly for fun without any specific product in mind . When I wander through the bookstore , I am likewise just browsing to see if anything might interest me . If something does , then I rapidly scan through a book to determine whether I would enjoy reading it . Much information browsing is of a serendipitous nature , and this makes it very difficult to create an electronic profile so that an information service on the superhighway could know your information needs in advance . The capacity needed to enable me to browse electronically through the high-quality , color images on the pages of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless the government or somebody else subsidized the network , which indeed has been the case for the Internet . But even if the capacity were available and affordable , most people seem to prefer reading material on paper rather than on a computer screen . Earlier , in the description of the technological Utopia , we read about home real estate shopping by computerized profiles . Such systems have been developed and have failed , again because most people are not able to articulate their specific needs . A good real estate agent knows how to observe the reactions of a client and how to ferret out specific , unspoken needs and lifestyles to match the client to a home . There are times , however , when I actually look for specific information . Assume I know I want to buy a green widget in size 78 . I now want to know who has the best price and the quickest availability . 92 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS An electronic service would be very helpful for this form of information and could save me much time and trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not cost extra . CONSUMER EXPENDITURES The revenues that many promoters of the information superhighway expect to generate defy imagination . Realistically , consumers have finite incomes , although the information highway companies seem to have unlimited resources to spend in their quests for the Grail . A way to shed some light of realism on these extraordinary expectations is to examine how the average household currently spends its money each month . The following table presents an estimate of these monthly expenditures and is based on data reported publicly . Where indicated , the data is the number of households using each specific product or service , appropriately normalized. 7 . CONSUMER NEED / 93 The $33 per month spent on CATV looks like a tempting target , but only about two-thirds of TV households subscribe to CATV . It is reported that Bell Atlantic expects to generate $58 per month per subscriber for interactive video services : $28 for traditional video , $24 for video on demand and other interactive services ( shopping , games ) , and $6 for other services . Although the $24 for traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks overly optimistic given the high penetration of VCR machines , and video rental stores on every corner . VIDEO ON DEMAND : WHO NEEDS IT ? Today 's home is bombarded with an overwhelming variety of media delivered over an equally overwhelming variety of media . Audio entertainment is physically delivered to our homes on compact discs and audio cassettes and is delivered over the air by FM broadcast radio . We listen to talk shows on AM broadcast radio and obtain the morning news by radio and the physically delivered morning newspaper . Magazines , books , and advertisements are physically delivered each day to our homes . Video entertainment reaches our homes physically in the form of VCR tapes from the video store and on video discs . Video entertainment reaches our homes over radio waves broadcast over the VHF and UHF spectra and also directly broadcast to us from communication satellites in geosynchronous orbit over the earth 's equator . Video entertainment also reaches us over the coaxial cable of the CATV firm . More video entertainment reaches us than we could ever possibly watch , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is boring . Yet , according to market data , we continue to watch it for about five hours each day . But is the TV set simply on to keep us company while we do other things , such as read a book or eat dinner ? Video on demand is touted as being more convenient than making a trip to the video store . I suspect , however , that the trip to the video store can be an excuse to get out of the home and that wandering around looking at all the video boxes is actually in itself a form of entertainment and amusement . However , the tape still needs to be returned after its use , and this can be a chore . My guess is that video on demand will need to cost less than renting a video from the video store . If my conclusion is correct , the Baby Bells 94 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS are in for a financial fright . The low usage of video on demand in the Rochester , NY trial seems to confirm my conclusion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be increased greatly , perhaps even fourfold , because of the convenience and variety of offerings from video on demand over their network . There is yet another financial problem with video on demand . We know from telephone service that consumers do not like usage sensitive pricing where they pay for the amount of time for each local call . Consumers are accustomed to spending money to purchase and own a product or to rent a video tape . However , they do not like to pay each time they view a video . If going to the video store was a large problem , video delivery services would abound . If returning the tape were such a great problem , video return boxes would appear on every street corner . I can understand that popular videos might be out of stock , which could be frustrating . However , this is one area where technology could help . A popular video could be downloaded to the store over a network and a tape made immediately while you waited , perhaps browsing through other videos and ordering some popcorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for CATV in my area . The premium CATV channels offered mostly sports , and the basic CATV channels offered more of the same kinds of programs that were available from VHF and UHF broadcasts . To be truthful , I must admit that I do not subscribe to CATV and am more than satisfied by the " free " TV that I receive over my attic antenna aimed at New York City . CATV offers little extra to me , other than more of the same and more of the old same in the form of reruns of old network programs . If over-the-air TV was not available in my area , or if the signals were very weak and of poor picture quality , I would subscribe to cable TV . Many people in New york City subscribe to cable TV for exactly these reasons . A friend of mine in rural New jersey is not passed by the cable of cable TV , and hence he subscribes to the 150 channels of direct broadcast satellite TV provided on DIRECTVTM . I was overwhelmed by all the channels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most exciting program I found was world weather . If such program content is what CATV and DBS offer , then there indeed may even be a market for my boring lectures on the life of the sine wave . A problem with video on demand is that you must know exactly what you want to watch . An advantage of conventional television is that 7 . CONSUMER NEED / 95 the TV broadcasters think they know what you want to watch . The disc jockey exists to choose what to listen to for us . You could have access to all the world 's music , but you would then have to know exactly what you wanted to listen to . The broadcaster decides the specific music broadcast over radio so that the listener does not have to make any choices . Indeed , there are times when we know exactly what we want to listen to , but many times we are quite willing to allow someone else to choose for us . Of course , the system could program material based on your past listening habits , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio and CDs is that my patterns change and I like surprises . One way to approximate true video on demand is to transmit 500 or more TV programs to the home , the concept known as near video on demand mentioned earlier . The problem is how to search through 500 channels to find the one to watch . If you looked at each channel for a half second , then you would need over four minutes would be needed to surf through all 500 channels . Clearly some form of electronic program guide would be needed , but I wonder if looking at the program guide might not be more fun then watching the programs themselves . One way to use 500-channel TV would be to send the same program starting at different times , so you could watch a program at your convenience . However , most people already use their video cassette machines to record TV programs for viewing at a more convenient time . It is difficult from a consumer perspective to determine the advantage of 500-channel TV , but if it were available consumers might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information at your fingertips is what videotex promises , as does also the Internet and the World Wide Web . Access to all sorts of data bases containing all sorts of information , everything you ever want to know , is irresistible . Instant access to people all over the world through e-mail is equally irresistible . However , the vision can be a nightmare too . We certainly need information . But we are bombarded with information all day at work , and when we return to home , we are bombarded by junk mail and television . If anything , there is too much information . We enter a state of information overload . The way I obtain the information I really need is through other 96 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS people , mostly by speaking to them over the telephone . Perhaps I am just old fashioned and a technological Luddite , but my telephone really is my major means of electronic communication . Although my office has facsimile , I do not have a fax machine at my home offices . Nor do I have an address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overloaded with information nor will I allow others to program my time and priorities . E-mail is a good way to stay in contact with people , particularly for a team of people working together on a common project . However , although e-mail offers you contact with many people all over the world , it also offers all of them contact with you . The problem can again become information overload as you attempt to manage all the unwanted communication . And if speaking to everyone on the phone and reading all your e-mail is too much , imagine looking at everyone who calls you , which is what the videophone would offer . THE VIDEOPHONE : STILL UNWANTED I know I am getting old when half my audience has not seen the Stanley Kubrick movie version of Arthur C. Clarke 's 2001 : A Space Odyssey . Those who have seen it will remember the picturephone call from the orbiting space station to earth . While at Bell Labs , I was asked to suggest a design for the picturephone equipment used in this movie . So a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the logical extension of the telephone . Although the design I suggested for 2001 was clearly fiction , AT &T; spent $500 million in designing and manufacturing its picturephone of the early 1970s . Why then do n't we all have picturephones ? Whenever I speak to an audience about videophones I will ask how many people would like to see the other person while talking with them on the phone . There will usually be a showing of a few hands . I then ask how many people would be wiling to be seen while speaking on the phone . There are hardly any hands raised . This then is the basic problem with the videophone : very few people are willing to be seen while speaking on the phone . There is an intimacy to speaking on the phone that somehow is invaded by the visual dimension of the videophone . Most people when they want to really pay attention to what you are saying will close their eyes to block out the visual dimension . Thus , videophones simply do not add much to , and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CONSUMER NEED / 97 call . The videophone seems to be mostly a product of science fiction , and its only market is science fiction movies and TV shows . Most consumers do not want a videophone ? at any price . The negativism is so strong that the only way to make money with videophones would be to offer them as standard telephone service and then charge extra not to have them ! Some corporate executives want very much to be seen by their employees and hence use video as a means to broadcast their image to their employees . Such corporate video is typically one-way since the executives have little interest in seeing the employees . I suspect that video teleconferencing is also used by some people who want to project themselves over TV , perhaps in fascination with playing at being a TV news anchor . TELE-EVERYTHING Humans are social creatures seeking contact with other humans . Although I usually work at home a few days each week , I find that I need social contact with my colleagues . Hence , I commute to New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my office at the University of Southern California when I am on the West Coast , to meet with my colleagues . And along the way , I meet other people in various chance encounters . The technological Utopian vision of people always working at home , telecommuting to work , and maintaining contact electronically solely over the superhighway is greatly exaggerated in its scope . Computer " nerds " might want to avoid social contact , but most normal people crave contact with other people . Technology should never deny humanity but should serve the needs of humanity . Tele-eduction , distance learning , and the video classroom are likewise over promoted in importance and impact . Students come together to study and learn , and it is this physical coming together that creates a place of learning . One can imagine that when the book was first invented there were those who predicted the end of educational institutions , since students would now be able to study and learn from a book by themselves without the need to travel to the university . The university of the future will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overemphasis on educational technology , but instead uses technology to enrich the 98 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS educational experience at the university . Books are disappearing from libraries , not because of technology but because of theft and incorrect shelving . The electronic library ignores the fact that computerized books are difficult to read from a CRT screen and are even more difficult to browse . The problem in many libraries is that the book you want to find is not there . Technology has had great impact in computerizing the card catalogs and now needs to be used to protect books from theft and loss . Computerized searches have increased access to information , but have also made scholars lazy . Furthermore , much material has not been computerized and is not found in the electronic searches . THE KILLER APPLICATION When I worked on the AT &T; videotex project with Knight Ridder Newspapers , we attempted to present as many different applications as possible to the participants . We did this because we believed that no one single application would be sufficient to justify the service to most users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and states that a single winning application may indeed justify the whole system . The person who finds that application will make a financial killing ? hence the term " killer " application . If there is no such killer application , then it is quite possible that many promoters will instead themselves be killed in their search for the killer application . " The search for the killer application " sounds to me like a title for a horror movie . The truth is that the killer applications are known but are not acceptable socially . Gambling and pornography are the possible killer applications , but they both have very negative social connotations . CONSUMER INNOVATION Consumers sometimes are often better at innovating than the inventors of new technology . One example is the video cassette recorder or the VCR . The VCR was originally conceived as a means for consumers to watch pre-recorded tapes at home and to amass their own video libraries by recording shows off the air . Consumers did all these things but discovered that they could record shows and then watch the show at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VCR. 7 . CONSUMER N EED / 99 CONSUMER ELECTRONICS About a dozen years ago , I performed a study of consumer electronics to determine the fundamental driving forces that , in my judgement , seemed to produce positive benefits to consumers and thus account for market success . My study focused on entertainment-based products and services . I examined the history of a number of products and services and their technological evolution . One example is the evolution of the Edison sound cylinder to the 78-rpm disk to the long-playing record to stereo and to today 's digital compact disc . Improved quality , improved sensory appeal , long life , and compactness are some of the consumer benefits that emerged from this technological progression . The consumer benefits that appeared common to most entertainment-oriented consumer-electronics products and services were : sensory appeal , quality , ease of use , portability , personal , program variety , and on-demand use . My guess is that these are still the most important factors to most consumers . Of course , price is also very important , but as discussed earlier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in consumer electronics as the norm . Based on my list of driving forces , I predicted success for the then fledgling compact disc . Another aspect of my study was the bandwidth of entertainmentbased media compared to communication-based media , such as the telephone . I concluded that entertainment was mostly a broadband process , but that communication for exchanging information and views was a narrowband process . It also seemed that increasing the bandwidth of entertainment media was related to increasing sensory appeal and hence was desirable . For example , in audio , the progression from the Edison cylinder to today 's CD has been a progression of ever increasing bandwidth and improved sensory appeal . Telephonic communication is a relatively narrowband process . Attempting to make it broadband through the addition of the visual dimension of the videophone would clearly violate my model and thus failure would be predicted . It is interesting to note that such new communication services as e-mail are even more narrowband than the telephone . DIFFUSION OF INNOVATIONS I he cumulative market penetration of an innovation follows the so100 / HIGHWAY OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape , shown in the following figure . During the initial market entry , a small number of innovators try the new product or service , and they are then followed by the early adopters . The vast bulk of the market penetration occurs when the early and late majority of consumers adopt the innovation . Finally , the laggards adopt the innovation and the diffusion process is terminated . Prof. Everett M. Rogers has studied the diffusion of innovations intensively and has concluded that a number of attributes which emerge in answer to the following questions affect the diffusion process . What is the relative advantage of the innovation compared with older products , services , or methods ? Is the innovation truly better ? Is the innovation compatible with the values , beliefs , and needs of the adopters ? How complex is the innovation to use , understand , and purchase ? What is the social status of the innovation ? Can it be used easily on a trial basis ? Is use of the innovation observable to others ? DETERMINING CONSUMER REACTIONS How does one determine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service ? The simple way is to ask them . And this leads to a range of market research methodologies for performing the task of " asking , " such as questionnaires , interviews , observations , focus groups , and trials . Each methodology has its advantages and disadvantages . 7 . CONSUMER NEED / 101 A serious problem with determining consumer reactions to new products and services ? particularly those involving the superhighway ? is that most consumers have not had any personal experience with the new product or service . Under such unfamiliar circumstances , most people will respond positively , especially if the product or service is described only in positive terms and is positioned as high technology and futuristic . Few people want to appear negative toward technology and the future . There are solutions to these problems , though . The new product or service can be described in a neutral fashion , presenting both positive and negative aspects . There are a variety of methodologies for determining and measuring consumer reactions . The two broad means of determining consumer reactions are primary research and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies and production of data . Primary research is costly and time consuming , but the data is specific to the product or service being evaluated . Secondary research is the examination of data collected by others . Secondary research is inexpensive and fast , but the data is usually not exactly specific to the product or service under evaluation . Consumer research can be qualitative , in which general reactions are obtained , or quantitative , in which numeric values are assigned to the consumer reactions . The reliability of a study pertains to whether the results can be replicated and make statistical good sense . The external validity of a study pertains to whether the results can be generalized to a large number of consumers . Internal validity pertains to the internal design of the study and whether the results are meaningful measures . Consumer research can be conducted in a laboratory setting in which all variables are carefully controlled , but a laboratory environment usually is not very realistic . Field research is conducted in the real world and is realistic , but many factors that could affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently evaluated through observation of the behavior of the participants . Both laboratory research and field research can become contaminated through various factors , such as experimenter bias and improper selection of the participants . All research designs should be pretested to be certain that the design works and is measuring what is desired . In a manipulative design , the Independent variable refers to the factor being manipulated and the dependent variable is the outcome being measured . Surveys are perhaps the most frequently conducted method of 102 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS consumer research . Surveys are conducted through the use of questionnaires . Questionnaires can be self administered , usually on paper by mail or at a site , or they can be administered by a questioner , either in person or by telephone . Questionnaires are composed of a number of questions with responses that can be organized in a check list , ranked using various kinds of scales , compared by preference , or openended . The problem with questionnaires is whether the sample of consumers chosen for the study truly represents the larger external population to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if some people are more willing to respond than others . The size and constitution of the sample needs careful consideration . The questions themselves need very careful design and adequate pretesting to be certain that they are understood and produce responses that are accurate measures of the true feelings of the respondents . How a question is asked can bias the results . For example , asking people whether they want to see the other person during a telephone call can generate very different responses from asking people whether they are willing to be seen during a telephone call . A technique frequently used to obtain consumer responses to a new product or service is to use a focus group . A small group of consumers , usually chosen to have similar demographics , are assembled in a room and are lead in a discussion about the new product or service by a professional moderator . The sponsors of the study typically are in a separate room separated from the interview room by a one-way mirror so that they can not be seen by the participants . Each participant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can react themselves . While the results of focus groups are not statistically significant , a focus group can give an overall impression and suggest ways to market and position a new product or service . Focus groups are subject to the whims of the moderator , a single vocal participant can sway the whole group , and the small number of participants might not represent any larger population . Another means to determine consumer reaction to a novel product or service is to offer the product or service in a trial . Real consumers then will have real experience in actually using the product or service . The consumers might actually be asked to pay real money for the use , thereby giving real market information . However , all the promotion and attention given to most trials creates a sense of positivism in most 7 . CONSUMER NEED / 103 consumers , thereby skewing the results positively . It takes careful design and attention to avoid the problems of trials , along with independent evaluation . So important are the pitfalls of trials that a later chapter is devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own , in which the people implementing the trial would be the last to terminate their own jobs by presenting a negative finding . Most of today 's superhighway trials are technology trials testing whether the technology will actually work or not . The market trials conducted thus far use small populations of consumers thereby raising questions about how the participants were chosen and how representative they are of the population of normal consumers . BUSINESS AND THE CONSUMER We all probably agree that the consumer is the most important factor in shaping and determining the future . However , any new product or service is developed and provided to consumers by businesses . The culture of the business entity , corporate strategy , the pricing and billing mechanisms , the commitment to service , and other such aspects of the business comprise the last factor in shaping the future . Chapter 8 BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS The most wonderful new product or service is of little value without an appropriate business to provide it to the public . In this chapter , we examine some of the various business considerations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BUSINESS STRATEGY " Strategy " and " strategic " are much in vogue today , and even universities are attempting to think and plan strategically . But an objective comes before a strategy . A strategy is simply the plan and actions to achieve the objective . And objectives should be consistent with the mission of the organization . So we have mission , objective , and strategy . It certainly sounds simple and should be , but I have seen many lengthy and meaningless mission statements . A few years ago , an op-ed piece that I wrote about the AT &T; acquisition of NCR was published in The New York Times . In it , I accused AT &T; of having a confused corporate mission and suggested that AT &T; should divest manufacturing and concentrate on network services . In its response , also published in The New York Times , AT &T's; chief strategist , Richard Bodman , disagreed with my advice and criticism , and stated that AT &T's; " mission is broad and deep : to be the world leader in information technology . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was even more confused than we had thought . How do you measure " world leader " ? What is " information technology " ? Both these terms are so " broad and deep " as to be meaningless and unmeasurable . Later in this chapter , we shall see that AT &T; ultimately decided to divest 105 106 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS manufacturing in 1995 . Many companies and universities do not really understand strategy , mission , and objectives . The mission statements are apple-pie and motherhood with unmeasurable objectives and confused lengthy strategies . AT &T; has become more focused today and has concentrated on providing communication service . The announcement in 1995 of its planned divestiture of its manufacturing businesses is consistent with this more focused mission as also was the acquisition of McCaw 's cellular business . However , the McCaw acquisition places AT &T; in direct competition with the cellular ventures of the Baby Bells , and perhaps this was a factor in the clamoring by the Baby Bells to be allowed to provide long-distance service in competition with AT &T.; Before the mergers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional holding company providing local telephone service in the United States . GTE used to be a mini version of the Bell System with its own manufacturing arm , Automatic Electric , and its own long-distance company , Sprint . But GTE divested its manufacturing and long-distance operations , and also its Sylvania lighting division . GTE developed a clear strategy to focus on the provision of local telephone service . Given the large profit margins of local service and also GTE 's excellent profitability , this strategy has clearly paid well for GTE . However , there are murmurings that GTE is thinking of re-entering long distance . Pacific Telesis decided to concentrate its efforts on providing local telephone service , and thus divested its cellular and other ventures into a new company , AirTouch Communications . In 1995 , Pacific Telesis had a profit margin of 12 percent , but AirTouch 's profit margin was only percent . Telesis 's cash flow margin was 43 percent versus AirTouch 's percent . Clearly , the provision of local telephone service is a very profitable enterprise and focusing on it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two businesses : one to its local telephone business and the other for its ventures into entertainment and multimedia . This might ultimately lead to separation of local telephone service from the other ventures , which th far have been much less profitable . Of course , the hope is that the cellular and new ventures , though risky , will ultimately become great financial successes . But for 1995 , the US WEST Media Group ? the new venture company ? had a profit margin of only 6 percent versus the profit mar of 12 percent for the US WEST Communications Group ? the telephone company . US WEST is not alone in discovering that the provision of local 8 . BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS / 107 telephone service is very profitable ? much more so than entertainment and multimedia . THE BABY BELLS ' PURSUIT OF STRATEGY All the Baby Bells became linked with each other in various combinations through a series of joint ventures in the cellular and entertainment businesses announced in 1994 . Bell Atlantic , NYNEX , and Pacific Telesis joined together in 1994 to develop home entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artists Agency , but the venture was dissolved a year later . Ameritech , Bell South , and SBC Corporation ( formerly Southwestern Bell ) joined in 1994 with the Walt Disney Company to develop new video entertainment services . Pacific Telesis divested its cellular and other new ventures in 1994 to create AirTouch which then linked that year with US WEST in a joint cellular venture . Bell Atlantic and NYNEX also joined in pursuit of a linked cellular venture , while a higher level linking of the Bell Atlantic/NYNEX and AirTouch/US WEST cellular ventures was also being contemplated . At the end of 1995 , Bell Atlantic and NYNEX were reported to be considering a merger , perhaps also with Pacific Telesis , to provide seamless local and long-distance telephone service . In February , 1996 , SBC announced its plans to acquire Pacific Telesis . In April 1996 , Bell Atlantic and NYNEX announced their intent to merge into a single company . One needs a map to follow all these joint linkages , mergers , and cquisitions . All this linking simply makes the relationships of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances for competition between them . US WEST has been the most active of the Baby Bells in pursuing the entertainment business . In 1992 , US WEST joined the CATV-giant TCI and AT &T; in a trial of viewer-controlled CATV . In 1993 , US WEST rchased a 25 percent interest in Time Warner Entertainment . In 1995 , WEST created two US WEST companies , each with their own stock , one for telephone service and the other for entertainment and other lures . Not only US WEST , but many of the Baby Bells are pursuing riot 's new ventures involving the provision of entertainment and of TV service . We must ask what they really know about the entertainment business , although their antics have certainly been 108 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS entertaining . The Baby Bells one day clamor to be in manufacturing , the next day in long distance , and then in video entertainment . What they do not seem to want to provide anymore is local telephone service . When Theodore Vail and his AT &T; gobbled up the local phone companies at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction and apparently kept the Bell companies under control . Now that the Baby Bells are free of AT &T,; they seem to be struggling for a sense of purpose and direction . The glamour and glitz of Hollywood has indeed stricken them with media mania . But it is not only the Baby Bells who seem to have Hollywood fever . Many other firms are lusting after Hollywood , convinced that great pots of gold are at the end of the media rainbow . We therefore are seeing many mergers and acquisitions as many grab a partner before it is too late . Nobody wants to take a chance of being left outside in the cold when the warmth of sunny southern California and Hollywood beckons . We are reminded of Sony 's and Matsushita 's excursions through sunny California and of the billions of dollars they both lost on their purchases of studios . Yet the frenzy increases as computer software giants and newspapers join the party forming their own strategic alliances , mergers , and acquisitions . Although mergers and acquisitions seem to be gripping the communication industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific Telesis ' divestiture of its cellular business to create AirTouch . In the next section we will examine AT &T's; " breakup II . " Given all the nonsense , fear , and panic that seem to be gripping the communication industry , the best strategy is to sit on the sidelines and wait . Nothing will happen quickly , other than big losses . When the future becomes more certain is the time to act and join with the few successes . AT &T; BREAKUP II In 1990 , I performed a financial analysis of AT &T; and concluded that AT &T's; manufacturing business was losing money and dragging down AT &T's; overall profitability . My calculations showed AT &T; was losing from $1.5 billion to as much as $5 billion from the sale of products , although these estimates did not include any internal sales within AT &T.; I concluded that AT &T; should divest its manufacturing business and 8 . BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS / 109 concentrate on providing telecommunication services such as its profitable long-distance service . When AT &T; announced its intentions to purchase NCR in early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase further its exposure to the losses and low margins of manufacturing . As mentioned earlier , I wrote an op-ed piece in The New York Times stating that " AT &T; should probably be unloading its losing product business " and that " a proper strategy for AT &T; would involve developing and articulating a corporate vision to make the company the leading force in telecommunication services . " AT &T; did not then follow my advice . AT &T; continued to believe that there was some form of synergism between telecommunication services and computing . In a response to my op-ed by AT &T's; chief strategist , Richard Bodman , AT &T; claimed that " products and services are increasingly hard to separate . " Clearly within four years AT &T; changed its mind and finally followed my advice with its announcement in the Fall of 1995 that manufacturing and NCR would both be divested by 1997 . It does take courage finally to take action that admits and corrects a mistake . I guess it is " better late than never , " although I hate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the four years . AT &T; will break apart into three major companies : a new AT &T; dedicated mostly to providing telecommunication services , such as long distance and cellular ; a telecommunication products company , to be called Lucent Technologies ; and a computer company , to be called NCR . AT &T; further announced that it will sell its majority ownership of the AT &T; Capital Corporation and use the proceeds to reduce debt . My financial analysis of AT &T; Breakup II is based on figures from AT &T's; 1994 Annual Report and also from some details of the announced breakup . The Annual Report gives revenues for many of AT &T's; separate business along with direct costs . However , research and development ( R &D); and selling , general , and administrative ( SG &A); expenditures are stated only from a corporate perspective and are not allocated to the separate businesses . The trick is how to perform these allocations so that each business can be assigned all its costs and than reassembled according to the new breakup . R &D; expenditures for 1994 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be assigned to the new AT &T,; and that the remaining 22,000 will be assigned to Lucent Technologies . If we assume that NCR 's R &I); 110 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS is a high 11% of revenue , then R &D; for NCR would be about $0.5 billion , leaving $2.6 billion to be allocated across the new AT &T; and Lucent Technologies according to their share of the 26,000 Bell Labs people . This works out to $0.4 billion for the new AT &T; and $2.2 billion for Lucent Technologies . AT &T's; SG &A; expenses for 1994 was a large $19.6 billion . The allocation of SG &A; expenses across AT &T's; various businesses clearly has a large impact on the net profitability of each business . I investigated two approaches to performing this allocation . The first method allocated SG &A; expense in direct proportion to the revenues of each business after eliminating access charges . Access charges are collected as revenue by AT &T; but are then paid as an expense to the local telephone companies . Access charges in 1994 were a high 41% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the allocation of SG &A; if they were included in revenues . The second method allocated SG &A; in direct proportion to the direct costs of each business , again net of access charges . This approach is perhaps more meaningful than allocating by revenue since a business with high direct costs will probably also have high SG &A; expenses . A major surprise from the analyses is that no matter how SG &A; expenses are allocated , NCR is profitable , with a 4% estimated profit margin using revenue allocation and a 6% profit margin using cost allocation . At the time of its acquisition by AT &T; in 1991 , NCR was just barely profitable with a downward trend . It indeed is a miracle if AT &T; somehow had made NCR more profitable . I had concluded in my 1990 analysis that Western Electric was a financial drain on AT &T.; The new analyses of AT &T; breakup II confirm this conclusion . Depending on whether SG &A; is allocated by revenue or by costs , Lucent Technologies ' estimated after-tax profit margin is only a meager 1% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $20 billion . This is not a good picture either way . The corporate symbol for Lucent Technologies is a red , blurred zero ? which is very appropriate given my prediction of large losses . The new AT &T; will be a very profitable company , with an estimate profit margin of either 8% or nearly 14% , depending on how SG &A; i allocated . As a base of comparison , the more profitable Baby Bells had a after-tax profit margin of 15% for 1995 . The new AT &T; clearly will 1 more profitable than its major competitor , MCI . Will this then lead t increased price competition in the provision of lung-distance service 8 . BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS / 111 since the new AT &T; will no longer be held back by its less profitable manufacturing businesses ? The acquisition of McCaw 's cellular business by AT &T; makes much strategic sense and strengthens AT &T's; service business . However , McCaw has not yet contributed to AT &T's; profitability . Although McCaw created $2,062 million in revenue for the last nine months of 1994 when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in profits . In fact , AT &T's; profit margin would be higher if it abandoned the cellular business , although such a move might be a serious strategic error . At the time of the 1984 divestiture of the seven Baby Bells from AT &T,; I wondered whether it would have made more sense for AT &T; to divest manufacturing and keep the end-to-end provision of telephone service intact . I still wonder whether it was a mistake for AT &T; to have divested itself of the Baby Bells , particularly since they now want to compete with AT &T; in the provision of long-distance service . Manufacturing will now finally be divested from AT &T,; but not in reaction to any government pressures , although the government has been attempting to pry manufacturing from AT &T; for nearly a century . One wonders why AT &T; held onto manufacturing for such a long time . is divestiture is indeed ultimate since there will now be little left for T &T; to divest further . In its public statements about the new breakup , AT &T; has attempted positive spin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , AT &T; had become schizophrenic internally since the Baby Bells were both a customer in their equipment purchases and a potential competitor in long distance . It will be interesting to see ether AT &T; enters the local market , perhaps in collaboration with TV companies , to compete with the Baby Bells on their home turf . perhaps the easiest way for AT &T; to enter the local market would be to wire an already existing local telephone company which has national presence . GTE meets that profile . The Baby Bells have been lobbying over the years to be allowed into manufacturing . Given the low profitability ? and perhaps large masses of Western Electric over the last decade or more , one wonders wise the Baby Bells are in this strategy . If they still want so strongly inter manufacturing , perhaps they will make an attempt to purchase efficient Technologies once it is divested from AT &T.; A century ago , Theodore N. Vail , the founder of the Bell System , saw 112 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS the wisdom of long-distance service as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's vision glows even more strongly today as AT &T; returns to being mainly a long-distance service provider . R &D; COMMITMENT The telecommunication industry has been built progressively and steadily on major accomplishments in the progress of science and technology . The former Bell Labs was supported generously by AT &T; and created the knowledge base for much of this progress . To its credit , AT &T; continued its substantial commitment to basic research at AT &T; Bell Labs during the twelve years after the Bell breakup . Much of the results of this research becomes available to the entire telecommunication industry , thereby benefitting the United States as a whole . With the Bell breakup in 1984 , a new R &D; facility , Bellcore , was created to serve the Baby Bells with all seven as equal owners . Since then , most of the Baby Bells have created their own internal science and technology centers , although I personally have seen little of value from these small and unfocused efforts . After years of rumors , it was finally announced that the Baby Bells will sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little or no commitment to basic research in communication . I see now how wise it was for AT &T; to collect a small percentage of the revenues of the local telephone companies and then use these funds to support basic research . Without AT &T's; wisdom and commitment to longer term priorities , the Baby Bells seem doomed to a pursuit of shortterm profits and to media mania , and they do not care about research . The further breakup of AT &T; that will occur in 1997 will ultimately destroy basic research at Bell Labs since the new manufacturing business will not be able to justify this costly expenditure , given short-term profitability concerns . This elimination of industrial support for basic research in telecommunication is indeed is a sad day for the United States as a whole . CONVERGENCE AND SYNERGIES Decades ago the term " convergence " entered the business lexico Computers and telecommunication were converging according to the 8 . BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS / 113 believers and proponents of convergence . The use of computers to control telecommunication switching systems and the use of telecommunication to gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these claims of convergence . Business consultants then stated that to be adequately positioned for the future , a firm could no longer rely on being solely a computer company or a telecommunication company . Accordingly , IBM acquired Satellite Business Systems , and made a big mistake . AT &T; attempted to develop its own personal computers , and made a big mistake . AT &T; attempted to salvage something from its continuing belief in being in the computer business through an ill-fated involvement with Olivetti and then finally through the acquisition of NCR . NCR will be divested from AT &T; in 1997 thereby finally ending AT &T's; involvement in the computer business . A few years ago , business consultants concluded that a hardware company had to be in software also because of supposed synergies between the two . Based on the views of the synergists , the Sony Corporation acquired Columbia Pictures and the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company acquired MCA . The synergies never appeared , and both Sony and Matsushita lost billions of dollars in the deals . Manufacturing consumer electronics is a very different business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different business than providing telephone service . The finances are quite different , but more importantly , the management styles and basic siness skills are very different . MANAGEMENT STYLE Different businesses usually are associated with different styles of management . The management of telephone companies has traditionally on quite conservative . Management of a monopoly telephone company does not entail much risk , since there really is not much competition . It does however involve much lobbying with regulators d politicians . Working for the telephone company used to be a job for , but advances in technology have resulted in dramatic increases in productivity , thereby resulting in much downsizing for many telephone panics . The entertainment industry has a management style that is nearly tie that of a telephone company . There is considerable acceptance 114 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS of risk on the part of management in the entertainment industry . Most movies never recoup their costs , although the trick here is to risk investor money and never your own . There is much glamour and glitz in the entertainment industry , particularly on the production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the entertainment industry , and perhaps the investors who lose their money obtain some gratification from rubbing elbows with the stars . The CATV industry has a management style somewhere in-between the telephone industry and the production portion of the entertainment industry . Clearly , the entertainment business is quite different from the telephone business . Hence , if telephone companies were to enter the entertainment business , the creation of a new subsidiary to manage the entertainment ventures would seem to make good sense , and would also facilitate clear analysis of financial performance . Any possibilities of cross subsidization would also be eliminated . Investors with different objectives would also know more clearly what kind of business they were investing in . Another aspect of management style is a willingness to acknowledge and accept differing views . The Baby Bells appear to have fallen for their own hype about the superhighway . I wonder who is advising their top management and how much diversity in opinion is accepted within the companies . GTE California 's overly protective reaction to my critical comments of its Cerritos trial would imply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much in vogue at GTE . Years ago , AT &T's; corporate planning department was characterized by much independent thinking and by differing views , but much of this independence unfortunately vanished before the breakup of 1984 . Much of my time at the AT &T; Marketing Department was as an inhouse loyal critic , and my views were valued by my immediate management . Some companies can realize the importance of independent thinking within the organization . Decisions are best made as possible when as many differing views are openly discussed and considered . Today 's telecommunication industry uses very sophisticated technology , and I doubt that the top executives of many companies themselves have the engineering and technological background and knowledge necessary to understand the technology and its implications . This means that they must rely upon others within the corporation . Unfortunately , many managers have become proponents and promoters 8 . BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS / 115 and are more interested in their own short-term advancement than the longer-term future of the corporation . The result is self-serving advice that is often not the correct course of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fear at the top levels of management of many of the players in the drama of the superhighway . PROCESS MANAGEMENT In the late 1970s , the AT &T; Marketing Department invented a process for evaluating and bringing new products and services to market . The process was called the Phased Management Decision System , or PMDS for short . It consisted of seven steps with detailed requirements for documentation along with numerous phase review committees to evaluate each step . A number of thick binders described in detail the various steps and required supporting documents . The flow chart of the process was huge and covered many pages . It was clear to me that nothing would ever make it through such a complicated and overly detailed process . Such are the pitfalls of process management . It took a few years before it was realized that not a single new product or service ever made it through the complexities of the PMDS process , and ultimately PMDS was scrapped for a far simpler process . Indeed , a process for evaluating and bringing new products and services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be simple and easily understandable . Supporting documentation is also needed , but it too should be short and understandable . The problem with AT &T's; I'MDS , and similar such overly elaborate systems , is that all the emphasis is on the process and not on the new product or service . No longer is the product or service being managed , but the process becomes Aln end in itself . Committees and elaborate documents become the end objective , and the objective of evaluating and bringing a product or service to market in a timely fashion is forgotten . I recall remarking in my criticism that PMDS had become the end product and that no matter how nicely we packaged PMDS , customers would not buy it . While at AT &T,; I produced my own version of the business process . The process , shown in the two diagrams at the end of this chapter , begin with a synergistic matching of technology and consumer needs from which ideas are developed for new products and services . The marketability of these ideas is then tested and evaluated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology and consumer factors . The ideas 116 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS that are marketable create a vision of the future which then results in a strategy and plan to achieve that vision . Business cases , evaluations , and decisions need to be made along the way in an iterative fashion as more information and results are obtained . The final development process brings the product or service to the marketplace . The results of performance in the marketplace then modify the plan in an iterative fashion . An overemphasis on process management usually occurs when management is insecure and does not fully understand technology , products , services , or markets . By emphasizing the process , management feels secure that matters are under control . But managing the process then becomes the major objective ? not bringing products and services to market in a timely fashion . The process and its management can also become a weapon used to delay and destroy ideas and their advocates . In the end , though , such unwieldy processes usually die of their own weight , but along the way many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image of a company is an important factor in helping to determine what types of new businesses it might enter successfully . Telephone companies have had an image of being non-responsive to customers and of not really caring about customers . The usual response to a repair or service call to the telephone company is that they will do it their way when they decide . Who has not waited at home for hours for the telephone repair or installation people ? On weekends and evenings , most telephone company business offices are closed . I 'm reminded of the old adage : " We 're the phone company , we do it our way . " However , telephone companies do seem to have a positive image when it comes to the quality and reliability of telephone service . MANAGING THE CUSTOMER INTERFACE While conducting research for this book , I telephoned many different firms . Along the way , I learned a lot about how different firms manage the customer interface , and in particular , how not to manage this interface . My phone calls to many companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that then presented all sorts of options accessible by pushing the appropriate button on my touchtone phone . I found the long lists of options to be very confusing , and in some cases was never presented with an option that fit my particular case . When I finally did reach a human , some firms passed me from person to person as if my request for information were a hot potato . In calling two long distance companies to obtain information on their packet data services , I never did reach the right person and ultimately gave up . I recently responded to an advertisement in a major magazine for an investment company by dialing the toll-free number that was given . I obtained a recording that stated I had reached a nonworking number at the company . I finally reached an operator and asked to speak to the president of the company , but was asked which president , the New Jersey president or the New York president . Clearly , I would not trust my money in a company riddled with such chaos and confusion . The people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company to the public and should be adequately trained and know the company 's basic products and services . In the case of my attempts to reach someone familiar with packet switched data , many of the people I talked to at two large long-distance companies had no idea what I was even talking about . Recently , I was unable to obtain accurate information about some of the features of AT &T's; voice-message service and finally , after much finger-pointing between AT &T; and Bell Atlantic , had to discontinue the service in order to make my phone work worked at the AT &T; Consumer roducts division , we were planning to introduce a modem for personal computers . The problem was that our sales force knew nothing about modems , since their sales experience had been restricted to telephones . I Put together a short lecture on the basics of modems , and we videotaped It for showing to the sales people . The skills , knowledge , and competencies of the employees of a company determine what the company can do realistically with new products and services . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair . You are immediately intercepted by the computer with its recording asking you to enter a " 1 " if you have a touchtone phone . If you are like me , you have learned never to do that but instead to wait for a human . Otherwise ou are led through ever decreasing depths of a complex search to reach is human . Sometimes you never hear what you are listening for and are 118 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS tossed back out of the loop to call back again for another attempt . I have this image that some companies have downsized so much that there are no humans left ? just a computer answering the phone and connecting callers to voice mail . Billing is an important aspect of the customer interface . AT &T; has recently introduced direct billing for its larger residential accounts , but still obtains much of its billing through the local telephone companies . This is a clear mistake since AT &T; has relinquished its identity to the local telephone company . Both the CATV operator and the local telephone company have monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CATV service is not . The telephone bill thus is more complex and lengthy . SIZE AND COMPLEXITY A company can become too large , so that employees can no longer comprehend all the various different businesses that comprise the overall company . This is also true for top management . A chief executive can only be competent and knowledgeable in just so many areas . The more complex the company in such aspects as its organizational structure and different businesses , the more management and employee confusion that ensues . The management style and knowledge required for a manufacturing business is very different from that for managing a Hollywood studio , as Sony discovered with its ill-fated acquisition of Columbia Pictures . The Baby Bells plead to be allowed into manufacturing and entertainment , yet their management knows little about these businesses . Disaster most likely would be the result , but since the Baby Bells provide basic telephone service , which is an essential utility , the Nation can not allow the risk of such a disaster to occur . CUSTOMER RESPONSIVENESS Responsiveness is important in the telephone business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The repair office of the telephone company operates 24 hours each day and is always available . The telephone company business office is open during the business day and on weekends . Some telephone companies maintain evening hours at their business offices for the convenience of their customers who work 8 . BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS / 119 during the day . Most CATV operators maintain 24-hour access to their repair lines , but their customer service varies widely . Some are available on a 24-hour basis , but other close for minor holidays . AT &T; is always available 24-hours each day , demonstrating a true commitment to its customers . Telephone companies used to be notorious for missing repair and service appointments . The result is that in some states they are required to be on time , and , if late by some specified amount , must compensate their customer for missed work hours and other losses . CATV companies were equally notorious for lateness , and now many CATV operators offer a free month , or $20 , if they fail to meet an appointment by more than some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing a high level of customer responsiveness . Those who favor competition in the provision of local telephone and cable services will point out that with many competing providers there can also be many different levels of service , and those consumers who want the highest level will have to pay accordingly . THE POLICY ARENA Are local telephone service and CATV service natural monopolies ? I ) oes competition make sense and can it replace regulation ? How will universal service be provided to all in a competitive world where some customers might be far more costly to service than others ? What should be the nation 's policy in determining answers to such questions ? The Answers to these questions bring us to the last of the five links , namely , policy and regulatory issues . Chapter 9 POLICY AND REGULATORY ISSUES Telecommunication in the United States has traditionally been subject to regulation at the federal , state , and even municipal levels . This means t hat what may be possible technologically might nevertheless encounter regulatory and policy barriers . In this chapter we examine the fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture , namely , policy and regulatory issues . Remember that any venture will only be as strong as the weakest of the f ive links . Although some of the five might seem less interesting than others , they are all equally essential . We start our treatment of policy and regulatory issues with the creation of regulation for telecommunication and end with a discussion of the issues affecting the superhighway and video dial tone . THE CREATION OF TELECOMMUNICATION REGULATION In the distant past toward the end of the nineteenth century , after the expiration of the Bell patents on the telephone , a number of local telephone companies formed to compete with the Bell companies . By 1903 , the number of non-Bell telephones significantly outnumbered Bell telephones . In 1907 , the founder of the Bell System , Theodore N. Vail , returned to the Bell System as president of AT &T; after a twenty-year absence . Vail believed that the provision of telephone service was a natural monopoly and that competition made no sense . But he realized that unbridled monopoly would not be tolerated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DREAMS Vail 's solution was to endorse regulation at the state level to protect the public from the abuses of monopoly , although the cynic would claim that Vail only endorsed regulation because he knew that the Bell companies could dominate the regulatory commissions . The state commissions and various municipal regulators , from whom the local telephone companies obtained their franchises to use the public right of way , were the only regulators of telecommunication for nearly three decades . The Communications Act of 1934 created a federal body to regulate telecommunication in the United States , namely , the Federal Communications Commission , or the FCC . The FCC was created as a form of adversary to AT &T; and thus was opposed in principle to the Bell monopoly . For decades , the FCC has been attempting to force the introduction of more competition in the provision of telecommunication . In 1962 , AT &T; launched the first telecommunication satellite , Telstar . A year later , the first geosynchronous satellite for intercontinental telecommunication , designed by Hughes Laboratories , was launched . The FCC , under lobbying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &T; would monopolize this new technology . As a result , a new entity , Comsat , was created to control communication satellites . AT &T; was allowed no more than 27.5 percent ownership of Comsat . In 1972 , the FCC pressured AT &T; to dispose of all its interests in Comsat , thereby forcing AT &T; from the communication satellite business . The history of cellular service is yet another example of the FCC 's influence in promoting competition in the provision of telecommunication service . The technology for today 's cellular telephone service became available in the early 1970s , but it was not until 1982 that the FCC finally decided how to create competition in the new cellular industry . Hence , the availability of cellular service in the top markets was delayed until 1984 . The FCC 's solution was that there be two providers : the so-called wireline company ( usually the telephone company ) and a non-wireline company . Although given a congressional mandate to regulate telecommunication in the United States , the FCC seems to have developed a philosophical objection to regulation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . The FCC 's response to many issues , such as the need for standards for AM stereo , is to " allow the marketplace to decide , " or more recently , to auction off the radio spectrum for new , but , 9 . POLICY AND REGULATORY ISSUES / 125 yet nonexistent , personal communication services ( PCS ) . We will have to see whether this anti-regulatory stance of the FCC is wise or not . The FCC , however , certainly was out to dismember AT &T; and foster competition in the provision of long-distance telephone service . After a lengthy investigation conducted by the FCC and interrupted by World War II , the United States Department of justice , in 1949 , charged AT &T; with violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act . The case dragged on and was finally settled on January 12 , 1956 with a Consent Decree between AT &T; and the Justice Department . AT &T; agreed to limit itself solely to the provision of common-carrier communication service , and in return the Bell System was left intact . This Final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual break-up the Bell System . THE BELL BREAKUP Perhaps the single greatest impact on the future of telecommunication in the United States was the breakup of the Bell System that was mandated in 1982 and that occurred on January 1 , 1984 . The forces that led to this breakup were competition and the anti-competitive actions of the Bell System . AT &T; agreed to the breakup and helped in its design to be free of the restrictions of the 1956 Consent Decree . The 1956 Final Judgement restricted AT &T; to the provision of telecommunication and in effect prevented AT &T; from entering the computer business . AT &T,; however , had come to believe that it had great opportunities in the computer business and thus wanted to be free of these restrictions . The details of the breakup , which were agreed to by AT &T; and the federal Department of Justice , were stipulated in the Modification of Final Judgement ( the so-called MFJ ) . Judge Harold C. Greene presided over the antitrust case against the Bell System , and his court had to concur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Department of Justice and AT &T.; The major stipulations of the MFJ were the divestiture of the local he 'll operating companies ( BOCs ) from AT &T; and the restriction of the BoBOCs solely to the provision of local exchange telephone service within their operating jurisdictions . All previous business restrictions on AT &T; were lifted . The wording of the MFJ was clear in its intent to punish the BOCs and to prevent them from ever again using their local monopoly power for anti-competitive purposes . 126 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS Under the terms of the MFJ , the United States was organized into a number of Local Access and Transport Areas ( LATAs ) , and the Baby Bells were forbidden to carry telecommunication traffic between these LATAs , even if the LATAs were within their state . All inter-LATA traffic was to be carried only by long-distance companies , such as AT &T,; MCI , and Sprint . The punishment inflicted upon the BOCs was that intra-state long-distance was taken from them and given to the long-distance carriers . AT &T; had attempted to retain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOCs to retain this business . There also was a battle over the use of the Bell name , and in the end Judge Greene allowed the BOCs to retain their Bell identity and AT &T; was forbidden from use of the Bell name other than for AT &T; Bell Labs . The actual divestiture of the BOCs from AT &T; was a very complex affair but was accomplished in less than two years from the final approval of the MFJ in August 1982 . The BOCs were organized into seven regional companies which then owned the local BOCs . These seven regional holding companies are today called the Baby Bells , and many of them have reorganized to eliminate the identity of their local operating companies . In New Jersey , for example , New Jersey Bell has now become Bell Atlantic New Jersey to emphasize the identity of the regional holding company , Bell Atlantic . AT &T; retained its manufacturing arm ( previously , Western Electric ) and its long-distance business and was free to enter the computer , or any other business . The major reasons that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beliefs that its future was in computers and that the provision of local telephone service was no longer a growth business . THE BABY BELLS : THE FINANCIAL SUCCESS OF DIVESTITURE Perhaps the biggest surprise of divestiture was the financial strength of the seven Baby Bells . In 1982 , AT &T; had a net income of $7.3 billion and an after-tax profit margin of 11.1 percent . In 1984 , the first full year cat divestiture , AT &T's; net income shrank to $1.4 billion with a profit margin of only 2.6 percent . The seven Baby Bells had an aggregate net income of $6.8 billion and an overall profit margin of 11.8 percent for 1984 . Clearly , the local telephone companies were the financial strength of the old Bell System . AT &T's; manufacturing arm , Western Electric , might 9 . POLICY AND REGULATORY ISSUES / 127 have been profitable in the distant past , but it was no longer profitable and instead had become a financial liability to AT &T.; AT &T's; attempts to create its own computer business were dismal failures , and ultimately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NCR . But even with this acquisition , AT &T's; computer business continued to be a drag on AT &T's; overall profitability . Meanwhile , as we saw in an earlier chapter , five of the Baby Bells in 1995 had profit margins of 11 to 15 percent . The least profitable Baby Bell , NYNEX , had a profit margin of 8 percent for 1995 , which exceeded AT &T's; profit margin for 1994 . It took a few years for the ashes of divestiture to settle and for the Baby Bells to realize their financial strength . The Baby Bells created a few new business ventures in the areas allowed under the restrictions of the MFJ . Some of these ventures were outright failures , such as NYNEX 's and Bell Atlantic 's forays into retail computer stores . A number of the Baby Bells made international investments in cellular service , telephone service , and even CATV , but the results have been mixed . In many ways the Babies were learning about shaping their destiny and were flexing their muscles . The Baby Bells now seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . And like teenagers , they want no restrictions on what they can do . Over the past few years , the Baby Bells have mounted a well coordinated , collective campaign to be regulated less at the local level and to be allowed into manufacturing , long-distance , video entertainment , or anything else they wish to do . The Baby Bells financed studies that concluded that the telecommunication infrastructure in the United States had fallen behind most other industrial countries . The only way to remedy the situation , the Baby Bells claimed , was to free them from regulation so that they could invest in the new technology to construct a new infrastructure . A vision of a telecommunication Utopia was dangled before politicians along with promises of revolutions in the delivery of education and other social services . Of course , this campaign was hyperbole , but the Baby Bells achieved their goal of less regulation . By dangling large purchases of equipment before AT &T,; the Baby Bells effectively neutralized the one opponent that might have been strong enough to block their way . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions . The Baby Bells promised that if they were allowed into cable television , they would rewire the Nation with a new broadband network that would allow the delivery of video and a host of other new services . By 128 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS allowing the Baby Bells and other local telephone companies to compete with CATV firms , it was hoped that consumers would see lower charges , and that less regulation of CATV would be needed . CATV firms would be able to offer telephone service and thus less , or perhaps even no , regulation of them would be needed . The vision was that we would have telephone companies competing with CATV companies , and different telephone companies competing with each other in the provision of CATV and telephone services . Regulation would no longer be needed , and competitive market forces would shape the future , without government involvement . All this looks great ? after all , who is not in favor of competition . But as we saw earlier , the technology to allow all this competition simply does not exist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baby Bells will most likely use their financial power simply to purchase CATV firms , and there might actually be less competition . Or , the Baby Bells will use their great financial wealth to over-build cable and then undercut the existing CATV providers to force them into bankruptcy . As we saw in the previous chapter , the Baby Bells are becoming increasingly intertwined and are acting more and more like a single entity . In fact , Pacific Telesis will be acquired by SBC , and Bell Atlantic will acquire NYNEX . The telecommunication superhighway could become a road leading to greater control in the hands of a few large firms . Perhaps the past central direction of AT &T; kept the local telephone companies under control . Now that the Baby Bells are free of any parental control , they are testing the waters to see exactly how far they can go . They approached the United States Congress in an attempt to bypass Judge Greene and obtain legislative relief from the restrictions of the MFJ ? and they succeeded ! THE CONGRESS REWRITES TELECOMMUNICATION POLICY Early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Clinton signed ? the Telecommunication Act of 1996 . This legislation is intended to promote more competition in telecommunication by allowing telephone companies to provide CATV service and CATV firms to provide telephone service . This kind of attempt to reform telecommunication through 9 . POLICY AND REGULATORY ISSUES / 129 legislation is not new . In 1979 , similar attempts were made to reformulate the telecommunication industry through legislation . Legislation proposed then in the Senate by Senators Ernest Hollings and Barry Goldwater would have allowed the telephone companies to provide video transmission but not program content . Senator Goldwater 's legislation would have prohibited the CATV firms from providing telephone service , while Senator Hollings ' legislation would have allowed the CATV firms to provide telephone service , subject to regulation as common carriers . In the House , legislation proposed by Representative Van Deerlin would have allowed the telephone company to provide both video transmission and content and the CATV firm to provide all telecommunication services including telephone service . All these legislative initiatives of the late 1970s failed , perhaps because of lobbying pressures against them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today 's legislative attempt did not fail . Somehow a compromise was found to satisfy the conflicting views of all the various parties . More pressing affairs ? such as the federal deficit or a presidential election ? did not distract the attention of the legislators . Or , perhaps all these more pressing affairs so distracted the attention of the legislators that they passed legislation just to make the lobbyists happy . Whatever the reasons for its passage , it was without much oversight or analysis of the consequences . In its attempt to eliminate competition , AT &T; embraced the Consumer Communications Reform Act ( CCRA ) of 1976 , which would have virtually outlawed competition and protected the Bell monopoly . This attempt failed . The recent lobbying efforts by the Baby Bells for legislative relief from business restrictions is no less self-serving than the CCRA . But this time Congress did not see through all the lobbying . I believe that in the end the new legislation will need to be redone to eliminate all the harm to consumers . Furthermore , all the new rules in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the end , I would not be surprised to see the Baby Bells lobby against the new legislation . Undoubtedly , competition is the best way to " regulate " an industry . But the nature of much telecommunication seems to be a natural monopoly , or if not a monopoly , then at least so large in concentration and impact that some form of government regulation is needed . Is there some way to understand the real issues and suggest some framework to 130 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS set a balance between regulation and competition for the future of telecommunication ? I believe the distinction between content and conduit might be an appropriate framework to begin a discussion to unravel some issues . CONTENT AND CONDUIT The conduit is the transmission and switching network that carries various telecommunication signals . The content is the telephone , data , and video signals carried over these networks . We saw earlier , that in terms of revenue , content is key in the entertainment industry but conduit is key in the telecommunication industry . Telephone companies are common carriers that must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exercise any control over the content of the signals they carry . On the other hand , CATV operators control over both the conduit and the content . CATV operators are not common carriers . An interesting idea is to apply the concept of common carriage to the provision of CATV service . The operator would only provide the conduit . Users could access , or dial up , any desired video program from a myriad of video program providers . Thus , the concept of video dial tone , or video on demand , looks like a good idea and would result in more freedom of choice and less control over programming by the provider . However , as we saw in an earlier chapter , the technology to do this is still not at hand , and if it were , would be very costly . The key question is who would own the conduit for the provision of video entertainment . Currently , CATV operators and local telephone companies seem well positioned in the provision of telecommunication and in theory might compete with each other . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require duplicated local facilities , which would be costly and inefficient . Hence , it might be more efficient if one of them owned and controlled the conduit and the other packaged and offered the video content . But given recent history and the tremendous financial strength of the Baby Bells and other local telephone companies , it seems most likely that the telephone companies would attempt to purchase CATV firms and in this way control both the conduit and the content . The only way such a concentration of power could be prevented would be through appropriate legislation and restrictions on the local telephone companies to keep them out of the provision of content . Only then would the provision of conduit on a 9 . POLICY AND REGULATORY ISSUES / 131 common-carrier basis seem appropriate for them . A telephone company leasing a cable system to a CATV operator is not new , as we shall see in the next section of this chapter . The real issues center on the provision of programming . AT &T; AND CATV AT &T; and the old Bell System always had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually owned about 75 CATV systems in the United States . These CATV systems were leased to the local cable operator , and AT &T; had no involvement in determining the content of programming provided by the cable operator . In 1969 , AT &T; reviewed its policy regarding ownership of CATV systems and for a variety of reasons sold all but one of the systems during the 1970s . The last system to be sold was in Manhattan , where the cable operator was having trouble obtaining the required franchise from the city . Perhaps the single most important reason AT &T; abandoned the CATV business was that the revenues generated were not favorable compared to the costs . But if the tariffs were accordingly raised , the systems would not be competitive . There also were concerns expressed by the CATV industry about AT &T's; presence in the provision of CATV service , and AT &T; was encountering delays in obtaining the required authorizations from the FCC . In 1979 while I was at AT &T,; I prepared a presentation on CATV that my management made to AT &T's; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicted a confluence of telephone service and television that would occur in the early 1990s from the progression of technology . This progression would ultimately , in my view then , enable the CATV industry to provide telephone service and the telephone industry to provide television . I concluded that to the extent that the CATV operator could provide telephone service , this was a threat to AT &T.; But to the tent that the new technology would enable the telephone company to rry broadcast television in addition to voice and data , the Bell System d a new opportunity . Today , as a result of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 , the Baby Its are allowed to provide long-distance service , but AT &T; and the er long-distance companies are strongly opposed . The storm clouds gathering for a major battle between AT &T; and the Baby Bells . One appropriate strategic response by AT &T; would he to enter the 132 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS local business in competition with the Baby Bells . Since both the profit margins and total revenues are far greater for the provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have far more to lose from local competition than AT &T; has to lose from additional long-distance competition . One way for AT &T; to enter the local area is to develop the technology to allow local telephone service to be provided economically and simply over the existing coaxial cable of local CATV firms . AT &T; could sell the technology to CATV firms or enter into strategic partnerships with existing CATV firms . By bypassing the Baby Bells and other local telephone companies , AT &T; would avoid payment of access charges and could thus offer lower rates for long-distance service . Another way AT &T; could compete directly with the Baby Bells in the provision of local service would be through radio technology using fixed radio equipment in the home that would bypass the local loop of the Baby Bells . A third way for AT &T; to enter the local-service market would be to acquire GTE , since GTE already has a national presence at the local level . Meanwhile , in order to take on AT &T,; the Baby Bells are merging to become bigger ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , SBC hopes to acquire Pacific Telesis , and Bell Atlantic hopes to acquire NYNEX . W i l l the US WEST Communications Group join the SBC/PacTel combine ? What Bell South join the Bell Atlantic/NYNEX combine ? What will Ameritech do to become better by becoming bigger ? The coming AT &T/Baby; Bell battle should be exciting indeed and will add to the current chaos afflicting telecommunication in the United States . VIDEO DIAL TONE Much earlier in this book we saw that the CATV industry initiated a threat against the telephone companies 25 years ago by promising t0 provide telephone service over the CATV coaxial cable . In the en nothing ever happened , for a variety of reasons involving technolog policy , economics , business , and the consumer . Today , the telephone companies have initiated a threat against CATV companies by stating their intentions to provide television programs that are dialed up over the telephone network , or over s new infrastructure owned by the telephone companies . This n 9 . POLICY AND REGULATORY ISSUES / 133 approach to the provision of video entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted to counter this threat by investigating ways to offer telephone service over CATV facilities . The FCC 's position is to foster competition , and accordingly the FCC approved applications by telephone companies to offer cable service . The FCC approved a trial of video dial tone , to be conducted by Bell South in Georgia , offering video only over a system of 70 analog and 240 digital channels . The FCC also approved a request by NYNEX to build commercial video dial tone systems . The FCC gave approval to Ameritech to build a hybrid fiber/coax system for video dial tone with 240 digital , 70 analog , and 80 switched video channels . Ameritech predicted 1.3 million users by the end of 1995 and 6 million users by 2000 . Ameritech plans to own and provide programming . Ameritech is also very active in over building cable systems using present coaxial cable technology . The 1984 Cable Act forbad telephone companies to provide video programming in their own service areas . Citing their First Amendment tights to free speech , the telephone companies were successful in convincing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand how the First Amendment protects the free speech of Baby 11 executives and also the commercial speech of the companies emselves . But video programming is a product , and why First ' /Amendment should protect the right of the Baby Bells to provide this pecific product is not that clear to me . The Telecommunications Act of 996 ends this debate by allowing the Baby Bells and other local telephone companies to provide CATV service . CABLE MODELS sere are a number of models for the provision of video programming . The conventional cable model is that the operator of the cable system o be responsible for the selection and provision of all programming . to common carrier model is that the operator of the cable system have control over programming , not provide any programming , and nonpreferentially carry any and all programming provided by others . The Telecommunications Act of 1996 created a new type of cable service ? called Open Video Systems ( OVS ) ? for local telephone companies . With ( ) VS , the operator of the cable service can provide programming but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 134 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS nonpreferential basis . An OVS operator will be subject to less regulation but in return must not discriminate among video providers carried over the OVS . If demand exceeds the channel capacity of the OVS , then the OVS operator 's control is restricted to one-third the capacity . The FCC is given the task of specifying detailed rules for OVS before the end of 1996 . VERTICAL INTEGRATION The old Bell System was a vertically integrated monopoly . Bell owned everything from the telephone instruments and wiring in homes to the long distance cables across the country . Today , consumers own and provide their telephones , facsimile machines , and modems that are connected to the telephone outlet . Consumers also own the telephone wires in their homes , although they can contract with the local telephone company to service this wiring . Perhaps at one time in the distant past it made sense for the telephone company to own and provide telephones and inside wiring . But today it does not make any more sense to rent a $20 telephone from the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the electric company . But years ago , the electric company owned the inside wiring , outlets , switches , and even the light bulbs . Once this vertical integration of electricity was broken , a vigorous electric appliance industry formed with inventions of all sorts of new appliances . During the days of telephone ownership by the telephone companies , it was illegal to own and connect a non-Bell telephone to the network . I have heard stories of Bell employees entering people 's homes and removing any non-Bell phones . It was even forbidden to attach a neck rest to a Bell telephone handset , or even a plastic cover to a Bill telephone directory . Thankfully , those days are gone ? we have removed the phone company from our homes . It was very costly to send a telephone repair person to a home to repair a $20 telephone . Hence , telephone companies should be thankful that they are no longer in the business of intruding into people 's hones . It is far less trouble to provide telephone service to the customer 's premises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the premises . Today , the cable company owns the set-top convertor box and the inside wiring . The cable company has taken over the role of intruder into 9 . POLICY AND REGULATORY ISSUES / homes . When the local telephone companies provide video they too will be back in homes with ownership of set-top convertor boxes and inside wiring . Is this what consumers really want ? Do the telephone companies really want to be back into this very labor-intensive business ? UNIVERSAL SERVICE Telephone service is only valuable if everyone has it . Alexander Graham Bell , the telephone 's inventor , and Theodore N. Vail , the Bell System 's creator , both recognized this fact . Thus , the concept of affordable , universal telephone service was born . The Communications Act of 1934 formally endorsed universal service and made it national policy . It is interesting that sixty years later , universal service ? its definition and how to achieve it ? is still an issue . Universal telephone service has been accepted as nothing more than dial tone and access to the telephone network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services are all beyond basic universal service . But now that video dial tone has been proposed , the question arises whether it should be included as part of universal service . Broadband service has been proposed also , and the same question arises about whether it should be part of universal service . Video dial tone and broadband service are very costly and probably would only be affordable by a small number of households initially . Thus , telephone companies do not want to be forced to make these services available to everyone as part of universal service . But national licy does not want to create a class of citizens who do not have equal cess to all the information that supposedly would come over the uperhighway of broadband and of video dial tone . The same phone companies who promoted video dial tone and broadband service now find themselves arguing against providing these services to everyone . DIVESTITURE CONTINUES AT &T; divested itself of the local telephone companies in 1984 . Now some of the Baby Bells are continuing the process of divestiture . A uple of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is was considering divesting itself of its basic telephone business . I did a quick back-of-the-envelope financial analysis d concluded that such a divestiture would not make much financial 136 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS sense , since the provision of telephone service was the cash cow , and cellular and all the new ventures were not nearly as profitable . In the end , reason prevailed , and Pacific Telesis instead spun off its cellular and other new ventures in 1994 to create a new company , AirTouch . In 1995 , US WEST made a similar move by creating two classes of stock : one for the telephone business , the US WEST Communications Group , and the other for wireless and other new business ventures , the US WEST Media Group . Also in 1995 , AT &T; announced its plans to divest its manufacturing and computer businesses . Thus the process of divestiture continues . We saw earlier that the financial profiles of a telephone company are quite different than most media firms . Breaking up a Baby Bell , either directly through divestiture or through separate stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are attracted to both . It also makes it much easier to see how risky the new ventures really are and how well , or poorly , they are doing . It also might make it easier for the United States Department of Justice to force a breakup on the Baby Bells , if such a remedy is ever needed . Like CATV companies , the local telephone companies are monopolists at heart . We all know that monopoly is evil and must b. destroyed in favor of competition . Is n't this why we broke up the old Bell System ? Yet monopoly with effective regulation might very well be ant appropriate model for the provision of local telephone and of CATV services . The action of the telephone companies might be to extend their local monopoly to include the provision of entertainment and long ? distance service by the outright acquisition of CATV firms and loin distance companies . If so , then the old Bell System might reform rig before our eyes , but with a far larger monopoly than ever . The plans of SBC to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that such a reformation is indeed quite possi But would such a reformation be acceptable to the Department of Jus and if so , what safeguards would be needed ? Would the seven B Bells be allowed to merge and then purchase AT &T; to provide l distance service ? In 1974 people were convinced that I was crazy when I suggest that by 1984 the local Bell companies would be independent of AT &; T Yet this divestiture occurred exactly as I predicted . AT &T; said I w wrong when in 1991 I suggested that AT &T; should divest itself of manufacturing . Yet this divestiture will occur by 1997 . It seems 9 . POLICY AND REGULATORY ISSUES / 137 crazy things are normal in today 's telecommunication industry , and the crazier the prediction , the more likely it seems that it will occur . THE ANPA VERSUS AT &T; For decades , the newspaper industry has been fearful of electronic yellow-page services that might be offered by AT &T; and the phone companies . Such electronic services would threaten the newspaper 's lucrative classified ads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced its intention to conduct a trial of an electronic Yellow-Pages service in Austin , Texas . The American Newspaper Publishers Association ( ANPA ) was able to obtain a court injunction against the trial and halt A'F &T's; plans . However , in the same time frame , a different part of AT &T; was jointly conducting a trial of an electronic newspaper service ith Knight-Ridder Newspapers in southern Florida , thereby demonstrating quite clearly that AT &T; had no plan to dominate ctronic publishing . At the time of the Judge Green 's review of the MFJ , the ANPA was le to obtain restrictions in the MFJ to prevent AT &T; from offering any ctronic publishing over its own facilities for a period of seven years m the 1984 divestiture . The Telecommunications Act of 1996 prohibits Baby Bells from offering electronic publishing for four years from the to of enactment . STANDARDS Standards are very important . However , standards are sometimes overemphasized . Consumers buy a specific product or service ? not a standard . An example of this occurred with AM stereo . The standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite . t . The Federal Communications Commission decided that it would 4 decide on a standard and that instead the marketplace and radio industry should determine which standard was best . In the end , it did 1 really matter what standard was chosen , as there was no real market 1d for AM stereo . AM broadcast radio is " lo-fi " as contrasted with the l " but FM broadcast radio . Stereo indeed makes sense for FM , but littleservice for AM . Standards can actually impede progress . Once a standard has been 138 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS chosen , further technological advancement might make obsolete the chosen standard . The progression of standards for HDTV ( High Definition TV ) is a good example of this . The original approach to HDTV used analog technology . Within a few years , a digital approach using compression was suggested , and a number of different approaches have appeared . Given the continued fast pace of technological advances in compression , any chosen standard will most likely become obsolete . TV REGULATION The publication of newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " provisions of the Constitution of the United States prohibit such control . Television is the means by which many people obtain news , but since TV uses the scarce resource of the public airwaves , it is subject to regulation . To prevent a broadcasting monopoly , the FCC sets rules on the number of TV stations that can be owned by one broadcaster . These rules have been liberalized and changed from time to time and were even more liberalized by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 . One major rationale for regulation is scarcity and lack of competition . Today , we can obtain video programs from a large variety of sources : over-the-air VHF and UHF broadcast television , direct broadcast satellite , video tapes purchased and rented from video stores , video disks , and CATV . Given all these sources , is there a lack of competition ? CATV has not made any significant penetration in the United Kingdom where over-the-air broadcasting signals are available nearly everywhere and VCR machines are plentiful . Granted that the local CATV firm has a monopoly on the delivery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the content ? does this constitute a true monopoly given all the other sources of video programming in the United States ? But all the philosophical arguments mean little when the public becomes angered over CATV rate increases and clamors for re-regulation . CATV started as a " mom-and-pop " business bringing TV to areas n otherwise touched by the radio signals of television . Thus CATV w originally ignored by the regulators , since it was perceived as a go ( thing . As a result of pressure from local TV stations , the FCC reluctantly initiated regulation of CATV in 1965 , with rules on the importation distant TV signals ? the intent being to protect the local stations fr 9 . POLICY AND REGULATORY ISSUES / 139 competition . Over the years , regulation of CATV has increased ? and decreased ? depending upon the political climate and has been extended to rates . For example , rate regulation of CATV was initiated in 1988 and then terminated a few years later only to be initiated again in response to congressional pressure . The Telecommunications Act of 1996 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation , deregulation , and re-regulation . I imagine that this oscillation will continue . TELEPHONE REGULATION At the time of the Bell breakup , AT &T; assumed it would no longer be regulated after the breakup , since competition was established in the provision of long-distance service . Today , well over ten years since the breakup , AT &T's; long-distance business is still regulated by the FCC , under the justification that AT &T; is the dominant carrier , even though AT &T's; market share has fallen to only about 60 percent . The Baby Bells are also still regulated , which seems understandable since at the local level they still have a monopoly on the provision of local telephone service . But cellular service competes with wired local service , which offers the possibility for some form of competition at the local level based on transmission medium : wireless versus wireled . Before the Bell breakup , long distance calls within a state were carried by the local company which retained all the revenue . After the breakup , the Baby Bells were forbidden to carry this intrastate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ly their local access and transport areas ( LATAs ) . During the past year or so , long-distance companies have started to compete with the local telephone companies in providing toll service within LATAs . The local companies have decreased their toll rates in an attempt to compete and have offset this potential loss in revenue by increases in the rates for basic service . However , the more they charge for local basic service , the more lucrative it becomes for the CATV company or someone else to compete with the local telephone company this area . But , as we learned in an earlier chapter , the technology that would allow a CATV company to provide telephone service over the cable is still not at hand at competitive costs . We shall simply have to wait and see what the future brings . 140 / HIGHWAY OF DREAMS SUBSIDIZATION The goal of universal telephone service was to be achieved by making basic telephone service inexpensive and affordable to everyone . To achieve this goal , some customers and classes of service were charged much more than cost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long distance rates were kept artificially high to create profits that would subsidize local rates for basic telephone service . Business customers were charged about twice as much for basic service as residential customers , again to create a subsidy . On thing that has been learned from the Bell breakup is that subsidizations create opportunities for competitors who do not have to subsidize anything . Thus , MCI initially was able to " compete " with AT &T; since MCI did not have to subsidize local service . There is some controversy in my mind about subsidization since the actual true costs of providing telephone service for different classes of customers is difficult to determine . Hence , although it is generally accepted that business subsidizes residential service , I have never seen any real studies to support this claim . Since the residential telephone is used much less than the average business phone , one would expect businesses to pay more for basic service . 9-1-1 is the universal telephone number for an emergency . Telephone companies are required by law to collect a small sum from telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , police and emergency organizations have become innovative in extending the definition of 9-1-1 to include virtually all aspects of emergency communication , even to radios in police cars and to cellular phones . Once a subsidization is initiated it is almost impossible to remove . Also , the telephone bill can become a new source of " taxes " to subsidize social projects . In New Jersey , very low rates are offered to educators to connect classrooms with two-way video . Once initiated by Bell Atlantic , this is a form of subsidization that will be difficult to halt . The Telecommunications Act of 1996 actually mandates lower rates for schools and libraries . The telephone company should not , in my opinion , be in the position of determining societal priorities and then subsidizing certain customers or projects .
