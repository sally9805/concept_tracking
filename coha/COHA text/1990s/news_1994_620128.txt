<p> Harp wars is what they 're calling an ugly spat that has riled harp lovers in the Bay Area , considered a hotbed of plucking because of a hearty interest in folk , New Age and world music . <p> The sour notes started after last year 's Festival of Harps , when two women who helped stage the event in various Bay Area concert halls got into a legal wrangle . <p> At issue were contracts and control over the artistic and administrative ends of a 4-year-old arts enterprise that showed box-office promise . <p> Both agreed that the festival 's audience of 3,000 in Mountain View , Walnut Creek , Rohnert Park and San Francisco might easily double within a couple of years . <p> The Festival of Harps could then turn the corner to profit and bring new fans to a music community and instrument sometimes shunned by the mainstream as too froufrou . <p> HARPISTS BOND <p> The Festival of Harps  --  an outgrowth of a concert originally staged at the Noe Valley Ministry as a benefit for the Bay Area Folk Harp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The festival showed audiences that the harp  --  a national symbol in Ireland and Paraguay  --  could handle pumped-up rock and roll , jazz fusion , Celtic and Gypsy folk music , avant-garde art music , Latin and classical without losing that soothing tone associated with celestial glad tidings and , well , peace . <p> It seemed during last December 's festival that heaven was near at hand for harp lovers . Tickets sold briskly for the concerts at several Bay Area venues  --  it was the first big show at the new Center for the Arts in San Francisco  --  as did harp music on tapes and CDs hawked in lobbies . <p> But things are different this year . <p> Two harp festivals are competing , and their promoters , once allies , seem to have nothing but contempt for each other . The war is described in the official journal of the Bay Area Folk Harp Society ( it claims 500 to 600 members ) as " painful " and " horrid . " <p> It was success , perhaps , that sparked the dispute between Diana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Barbara Sansone , 42 , an events producer from Mill Valley . Both women come across as intelligent , sensitive and gifted , and both are respected in the arts community . <p> But a number of misunderstandings over verbal agreements the two made starting in 1993 began to surface early this year . <p> One thing both women now agree on is that taking things on trust , the way friends might , does n't always work in a complex business involving artist contracts , concert-hall rentals , corporate sponsors , the hiring of technical people and marketing and publicity campaigns to build an audience . <p> In essence , Stork , the festival 's founder and one of its main performers , would not agree to grant the rights to the festival 's name " in perpetuity " to Sansone . <p> ' MY BABY ' <p> " It sounds trite maybe to say it , but the festival was my baby , " said Stork , who plays harp in a New Age band called Geist with her husband , Teed Rockwell . <p> Stork said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flyers on bulletin boards and telephone poles all over the Bay Area , and months making all the arrangements for fellow artists to perform , she was building the festival " into what it is today  --  a beautiful celebration . <p> " I did n't want to turn the name and all over to somebody else . " <p> But Sansone , who had been under the impression that she would be the festival 's long-term producer and that Stork would serve as artistic director , felt betrayed by not being granted the position , and demanded remuneration for what she said she spent to back the festival . A figure of $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 has been thrown out  --  but everything is open to dispute . <p> " It was n't just money , but my expertise in publicity , marketing and administration , " said Sansone . " If it was n't for me , I doubt a festival ever would have happened last year . " <p> She added that her contacts in the arts world and smarts at using the latest marketing strategies " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of " hippie thing " it had been . <p> Sansone hired a lawyer and filed suit . She wants her investment back , plus punitive damages of $ 250,000 for an alleged breach of contract . <p> She also sought an injunction to prevent Stork from using the name Festival of Harps , but the injunction was denied in San Mateo Superior Court . <p> Meanwhile , Stork filed a countersuit charging harassment against Sansone for going ahead with her plans to stage a competing harp festival under the name Harps of the World . <p> The first concert in that series played to a small audience November 17 at the Regional Center for the Arts in Walnut Creek . <p> Now both sides have engaged veteran San Francisco publicists to put a positive spin on the competing events . They 'll be back in court January 26 to continue proceedings on the lawsuit . <p> Each camp is especially rankled at the other for scheduling major concerts in San Francisco on the same nights , December 14 and 15  --  Stork 's Festival of Harps will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sansone 's World of Harps at Herbst Theatre . <p> Although many musicians are taking sides in the dispute , all agree that there 's one good thing about it  --  instead of one series of harp concerts , there are two this year . <p> " Sad and painful as this experience has been personally , it 's good for people who want to hear a whole lot of harp music , " said Stork . <p> " The music is full of great surprises , and the Bay Area loves harps . " <p> " It does hurt to go through all this disagreement , " said Sansone , " and to feel like you 've given a lot to the arts community only to have someone try to turn that into a negative . <p> " The fact remains , though , that some good music is going to be played .
