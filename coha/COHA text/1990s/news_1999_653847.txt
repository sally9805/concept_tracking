<p> Flush with optimism about the way their case is progressing , the 19 state attorneys general who joined the Federal Government in the landmark antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corporation say they will not be satisfied , should they win the case , with any remedy that does not revamp the company . <p> No specifics have been decided about how that should be done  --  and probably none will be until the judge issues his ruling this summer . But as equal partners in the lawsuit , the states hold something of a veto power over the kinds of remedies the Federal Government can recommend , and the offices of the attorneys general are alive with discussion of the various options . <p> The one receiving the most favor right now would force Microsoft to license the source code for the Windows operating system to several other companies  --  instantly creating competition in the operating system business . <p> In addition , many of the states  --  including New York , Ohio , Minnesota and Utah  --  are eager to use provisions in their own laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violation " incident . " The amount for each incident varies , from $2,000 in Kentucky to $100,000 in New York , but there is little if any case law to suggest how an incident is defined in this context . <p> Officials in several states said they were hoping to establish that every purchase of a copy of Windows constituted a violation . " With per violation or per occurrence , that would be millions and millions of dollars , " said Doug Davis , an Assistant Attorney General in West Virginia . But state officials acknowledged that it was far from certain that the courts would uphold that interpretation . <p> So far , the states have stayed out of the spotlight , relying primarily on the Justice Department 's lawyers , most notably its lead trial lawyer and hired gun , David Boies , to argue the case in court . <p> Yet the states are key players . <p> Thirteen states researched the case cooperatively with the Justice Department . When it came time to file the suit last spring , one of those states , Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful of additional states , including West Virginia and Maryland , decided to join . That brought the total to 20 . <p> In December , South Carolina 's attorney general announced that he was leaving the group , asserting that competition in the software industry remained strong , making the suit unnecessary . The 19 remaining attorneys general say they remain strongly committed to the case . <p> After the Justice Department and the states filed similar but separate antitrust suits against Microsoft last May , the cases were merged and are being tried together . So , although Justice officials say they have not yet decided on what remedies to propose should they win , whatever they recommend to Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson must have the approval of the states as co-litigants . <p> In the end , the remedy Judge Jackson imposes might or might not be based on the recommendations of the plaintiffs . <p> Because state attorneys general are elected officials , their motives are not always the same as those of the Justice Department . They must be more responsive to their constituents  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When the suits were filed last May , " we got some constituent mail asking why we were harassing Microsoft , " said Mark R. Weaver , Ohio 's Deputy Attorney General . <p> But now , said Richard Blumenthal , Attorney General of Connecticut , " We feel vindicated . " <p> " The public , " he added , " has a much better understanding of Microsoft 's abuses and violations of law . " <p> While Microsoft insists that it will win the case , the hardened position on remedies is fueled by a growing perception among the attorneys general that their side has gained the upper hand in court . In interviews last week , attorneys general or their assistants in more than a dozen states said they had been pleasantly surprised , even thrilled , with their accomplishments in court  --  though all acknowledge that the judge could ultimately rule in Microsoft 's favor . <p> The Government and Microsoft have both completed presentation of their cases , and the trial is now in recess until mid-April , when each side will present rebuttal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our case has been more powerful and vivid than we ever anticipated . " <p> Jennifer Granholm , Michigan 's Attorney General , said : " We feel very good . It 's safe to say our confidence has improved ; the credibility of the Microsoft defense seems to have been seriously damaged . " <p> That perception has emboldened the states to consider asking for stronger remedies than they might have originally contemplated . <p> In a broad sense , antitrust remedies fall into two classes : conduct relief and structural relief . <p> If the court imposed conduct relief , Microsoft would remain intact , and its business incentives would not be changed . Instead , the company 's ability to engage in illegal conduct would be limited . One example might be to regulate the sorts of contracts the company could write . <p> Structural relief would include any remedy that would change the nature of Microsoft 's business incentives , the motivations for its competitive behavior . Structural remedies could include forcing the company to license the source code of its software to competitors . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bar has been raised , " said one attorney general , who like several interviewed , asked not to be identified . " The mere thought that people are talking about dividing up the company now shows that the thinking has advanced . It was mentioned before , but not discussed with the level of plausibility it 's being discussed now . " <p> One reason some states say they joined the Microsoft case was that they were not satisfied with the Government 's conclusion of the last antitrust case against Microsoft , in 1995 . That one ended with a consent decree  --  a form of conduct relief . <p> Microsoft , state officials say , immediately worked around the agreement , and all of the behavior that is the subject of the current suit occurred in the following years . <p> " With Microsoft , " a senior assistant attorney general said , " it 's pretty clear that conduct relief is not lasting . " <p> Several state officials said they were impressed with evidence introduced during the trial indicating that Microsoft had never taken the earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement , William H. Gates , Microsoft 's chairman , told a group of business allies , " This antitrust thing will blow over ; we have n't changed our business practices at all , " according to notes of that discussion . <p> In addition , Microsoft 's strategy in court  --  vociferously contesting every point , no matter how much contrary evidence is introduced  --  has helped convince attorneys general that nothing short of a structural remedy would have any effect . <p> " Their behavior has proven the need for an effective remedy , " said Wayne Klein , head of the antitrust division in the Utah Attorney General 's office . " There 's no contrition there . No admission that they did anything wrong . And we 're now in a position where we think we can establish something that 's effective . " <p> Ms. Granholm said , " We 've got to have a remedy with teeth . " <p> The attorneys general are now debating three possible structural remedies . The one least favored at the moment , several officials said , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new companies would keep the Windows operating system , another the applications programs like Word and Excel . A third company , possibly , would get Microsoft 's Internet and multimedia businesses . <p> That idea has lost favor , the officials said , because whichever new company had Windows would still hold a monopoly in personal computer operating systems . <p> Another idea is to break the company into three equal parts , each of which would have complete copies of Microsoft 's source code and intellectual property . They then would begin competing with each other . One problem with this idea is deciding which company would get Mr. Gates . <p> Some attorneys general say they worried that the third proposal  --  forcing Microsoft to license the Windows source code to other companies  --  would end up creating incompatible versions of Windows , resulting in software that runs on one machine but not on another . But other state officials argue that all of the companies creating new versions of Windows would have strong incentives to make sure their versions were compatible with the others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted that the states were not limited to these ideas . <p> " We 're still exploring things , " he said , " and other things might come up , stuff we had n't even though of before . " <p> But for all that , the states do seem unanimous about requesting one specific remedy : forcing Microsoft to pay their legal fees . <p> " And given the number of lawyers who are working on this , " said Mr. Weaver , the Ohio official , " that bill is not going to be insubstantial .
