1790-1990 <p> The Communist Revolution has been the most ambitious attempt in history to remake human society upon a theory . ' Edmund Burke correctly diagnosed the first such attempt , and in the process gave useful advice to those now rebuilding after the second . I. Truth and Consequences <p> ON NOVEMBER 1 , 1790 , Edmund Burke 's most famous book , Reflections on the Revolution in France , was published . It is important to get the title right . The book is often referred to as Reflections on the French Revolution . The book 's real title adequately reveals Burke 's intentions . Burke 's point , in wording the title as he did , was that this was not just a " French Revolution " but a general revolution begun in France but likely to spread to other countries , as indeed it began to do , through military expansion , less than two years after the publication of the Reflections . <p> But already well before the period of military expansion , and before Burke began to write his Reflections , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another way . This was an expansion through the movement of ideas , and through the strong sympathy , admiration , and spirit of emulation which various revolutionary transactions and declarations in France had aroused in certain circles in other countries , including Britain , by the end of 1789 . Burke 's Reflections was written with the deliberate aim of sounding the alarm against this form of revolutionary expansion . The Reflections resembles George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty-Four in two important ways . Both books were written about a revolution in another country and its consequences , and both were directed against British sympathizers with that revolution , and intended to isolate them . <p> Philosophically , the origins of Burke 's opposition to French Revolutionary ideas go back a long way : to his first book , A Vindication of Natural Society , published in 1756  --  34 years before the publication of the Reflections . <p> A Vindication was a prophetic work . In it , Burke set out to show  --  in an ironic mode  --  that an attempt to substitute " natural religion " for revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's immediate target was Henry Bolingbroke , an English Voltairean of the early eighteenth century and a spiritual ancestor of the English sympathizers with the French Revolution , who are Burke 's targets in the Reflections . There is an impressive continuity of thought and perception between these two books , separated as they are by more than thirty eventful years . It is a continuity that refutes the superficial contention of so many of Burke 's detractors that he " changed his principles " over the French Revolution . He did n't change his principles . He held to them with fierce tenacity in the Reflections , and in the rest of his writings and speeches against the French Revolution . <p> A Vindication of Natural Society , that remote predecessor , or ancestor , of the Reflections , is not a treatise against the Enlightenment as a whole . Burke was himself a child of the Enlightenment : a child , that is , of the early , English or English-inspired , phase of the Enlightenment . This was the Enlightenment of Locke and Montesquieu , an Enlightenment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Burke 's Enlightenment . But from the second quarter of the eighteenth century on , a different strain of Enlightenment emerged , and became dominant in France by the mid 1760s . This was the Voltairean Enlightenment , radically hostile to all forms of revealed religion , and contemptuously rejecting the entire Judaeo-Christian heritage . Burke , who was a deeply religious man  --  although there is some doubt about what his religion actually was  --  attacked the anti-religious strain of the Enlightenment with A Vindication , just as with the Reflections he would attack what he saw as the results of that strain in the French Revolution . <p> AS BURKE had foreseen ( in general terms ) in A Vindication , the discrediting of religion had the effect of condemning the established social and political system in that country where the discredit of religion was pushed to the greatest lengths . That country was France . The discredit of religion automatically discredited the monarchy , since reverence for the monarch  --  His Most Christian Majesty  --  rested essentially on the theory that the monarch was God 's anointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God Who personally intervened in human politics  --  then the monarchy was a fraud . The monarch was delegitimized by being desacralized , and the way was laid open for his deposition and execution . Edmund Burke opposed that whole process , or project , from near its beginning , with A Vindication , to near its end , with the Reflections . <p> Philosophically , then , the Reflections has deep roots in Burke 's thought . Politically it is also in strict accordance with a principle that he had laid down as early as December 1783 , explaining his initial  --  and protracted  --  unwillingness to attack the system of government of the East India Company . Burke , in that context , explained his " insuperable reluctance to destroy any established system of government , upon a theory . " That reluctance is at the root of the Reflections , politically speaking . And Burke had given expression to that reluctance nearly six years before the Revolution in France began . Those who seek to cast doubt on Burke 's sincerity and consistency over the French Revolution " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious qualms about the Revolution from the very beginning . His earliest known thoughts about it are contained in a letter to Lord Charlemont , dated August 9 , 1789 : TABLE <p> Burke did not , at any time , approve of the French Revolution , but he did not , during 1789 , experience any need to combat it . Burke 's decision that he must sound the alarm against the English sympathizers with the Revolution in France was reached in the third week of January 1790 , when he read a pamphlet containing the proceedings of the Revolution Society on November 4 of the previous year . The Revolution Society was an old established body , consisting mainly of Dissenters , which existed to commemorate the English Revolution of 1688 . The Society met annually on November 4 , that being the birthday of William III . The 1789 meeting was the first since the fall of the Bastille , and the participants used the occasion to celebrate and extol the French Revolution . The proceedings consisted of a sermon by a well-known Dissenting minister , the Reverend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dinner at the London Tavern ; and an address to the National Assembly . In the Reflections , the part of the proceedings which Burke concentrates on is the Price sermon . But it was the pamphlet as a whole that inflamed Burke and set him to composing the Reflections . The pamphlet firmly placed the British welcome for the French Revolution in a context of anti-Popery . The resolution carried by the Revolution Society at the London Tavern on the evening following Price 's sermon ran as follows : TABLE <p> On the same occasion , Price moved the Congratulatory Address to the National Assembly in Paris , which was duly carried , conveyed to the Assembly , and warmly welcomed there . <p> Thus , a society set up to celebrate the Revolution of 1688 was emphasizing the anti-Catholic character of that Revolution , while welcoming the French Revolution , which had already assumed an anti-Catholic character , notably through the annexation of Church property ( November 1789 ) . <p> THIS COMBINATION hurt Burke deeply , for it hit him along a fault-line in his political personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex officio committed to the principles of the Glorious Revolution of 1688 . But he was disqualified from sharing the feelings of normal English Whigs toward that Revolution . Burke needed to play down its anti-Catholic elements , and when the Revolution Society played them up , Burke suffered , and needed to strike back . <p> Burke 's mother was , and remained all her life , a practicing Catholic , as were her people , the Nagles , a family of Catholic gentry in the Blackwater Valley , County Cork . Burke spent six years of his childhood among the Nagles , and he shared their feelings about the anti-Catholic Penal Code , which unfavorably governed so many aspects of their lives . <p> Edmund Burke 's father , Richard Burke , was , at least outwardly , a member of the Established Church of Ireland , of which Edmund was brought up as a member . But Richard Burke , too , may have been a victim of the Penal Laws , though in a more insidious way . I have reason to believe that Richard had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to safeguard his career as an attorney . <p> Burke 's problem with the Glorious Revolution was that he was committed to its general principles , which had brought great benefits to Britain , but that he detested that Revolution 's most conspicuous and oppressive monument in Ireland , the Penal Code . <p> In his political career , Burke dealt with this problem by seeking to extend the benefits of the Glorious Revolution  --  the civil and religious liberty that it promised-to Roman Catholics , in Britain and in Ireland . In this effort , Burke had been assisted by the more liberal Zeitgeist of the late eighteenth century  --  the progress of the Enlightenment . Aided by this tendency , Burke had succeeded in masterminding the first measure of Catholic Emancipation  --  the Catholic Relief Act of 1778 . He had paid for that , by losing his parliamentary seat for Bristol in the general election of 1780 , as a result of the anti-Catholic reaction which followed that Act and found its most dramatic expression in the Gordon Riots of the summer of that year , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relief against which the rioters were protesting . <p> We can see , therefore , why the proceedings of the English Revolution Society of November 4 , 1789 , were so repugnant to Edmund Burke . But let me not be misunderstood here . The anti-Catholic elements in the English welcome for the French Revolution do not constitute " the reason why " Burke was against that Revolution . Burke was against it , on rational grounds , from the beginning , because of his objection to radical social innovations made on grounds of theory . What the proceedings of the Revolution Society accomplished was to enlist Burke 's emotions , in addition to his reasoning power , against the French Revolution . The Reflections is the fruit of that alliance . <p> Burke , while already at work on what would become the Reflections , was headed toward a break with his old friend , now the leader of his party , Charles James Fox . This became apparent in a debate in the House of Commons , on the Army Estimates Bill , on February 9 , 1790 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France . Burke fired a warning shot : <p> The House must perceive from my coming forward to mark an expression or two of my best friend , how anxious I am to keep the distemper of France from the least countenance in England . . . I am so strongly opposed to any the least tendency towards the means of introducing a democracy like theirs . . . that much as it would afflict me , if such a thing could be attempted , and that any friend of mine could concur in such measures ( I am far , very far , from believing they could ) I would abandon my best friends and join with my worst enemies to oppose either the means or the end , and to resist all violent exertions of the spirit of innovation , so distinct from all principles of true and safe reformation : a spirit well calculated to overturn States , but perfectly unfit to amend them . <p> Fox rose to reply , according to the Parliamentary History , " with a concern of mind which it was impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Burke , and explicitly disavowed any attempt " to introduce any dangerous element into our excellent Constitution . " Burke immediately and gracefully accepted the amende honorable , but the parliamentary episode did not end there . Richard Brinsley Sheridan , then the most prominent member of the Whigs after Burke and Fox , marred the reconciliation scene by declaring that he " differed decidedly from Burke " in " almost every word that he had uttered respecting the French Revolution . " Burke curtly replied that " henceforward " Sheridan and he " are separated in politics . " <p> The rift between the leading Whigs did not force itself on the attention of Parliament again until April-May of 1791 . In the meantime ( November ) , the Reflections had been published , widening the rift . This was a quiet period in the history of the Revolution in France , and to most Whigs , Burke and his book appeared extravagantly alarmist . Fox , under Sheridan 's influence , was becoming extravagant on the other side . <p> On April 15 , Fox declared , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Constitution was " the most stupendous and glorious edifice of liberty which had been erected on the foundation of human liberty in any place or country . " According to the Parliamentary History , " as soon as Mr. Fox sat down , Mr. Burke rose , mid visible emotion , " but was shouted down by the Whigs . He did not get a chance of taking the matter up until April 21 , which saw a sort of preliminary round between Fox and Burke , each man indicating that he was not prepared to back away . <p> On May 6 , the storm broke . Burke began with a long speech in the spirit of the Reflections . He ended with a direct attack upon the French Constitution which Fox so venerated : " I regard the French Constitution , not with approbation but with horror , as involving every principle to be detested , and pregnant with every consequence to be dreaded and abominated . " <p> Fox replied with heavy sarcasm , certain to raise the temperature . When Burke rose again , his speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own benches . Burke took these calls to be organized by Fox . He was probably mistaken in that  --  though Fox could have discouraged these demonstrations had he wished to do so . However that may be , it was Burke 's belief that Fox was encouraging the chorus of his former friends against him that led to the final break : " An attempt is being made by one who was formerly my friend to bring down upon me the censure of the House . In the course of our long acquaintance , no one difference of opinion has ever before for a single moment interrupted our friendship . " Fox is here recorded as whispering : " There was no loss of friends . " <p> Burke : " Yes , there is a loss of friends . I know the price of my conduct . I have done my duty at the price of my friend . Our friendship is at an end . " At this point , the Parliamentary History goes on : <p> Mr. Fox rose to reply : but his mind was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had fallen from Mr. Burke , that it was some minutes before he could proceed . Tears trickled down his cheeks , and he strove in vain to give utterance to feelings that dignified and exalted his nature . The sensibility of every member of the House appeared uncommonly exalted upon that occasion . <p> The opening part of Fox 's speech to which this was the prelude was kind and respectful to Burke , and it seemed for a moment as if the reconciliation of February 1790 might be repeated . But then Fox bethought himself of the Reflections , and opened his mind on that subject : " As soon as that book was published , I condemned it , both in public and in private , and every one of the doctrines which it contained . " That tore it . <p> Edmund Burke could not possibly remain a member of a party whose leader , in Burke 's presence and on the floor of the House of Commons , had totally condemned all the doctrines contained in Reflections on the Revolution in France . <p> Burke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and the quarrel between Burke and Fox became irreparable . <p> As it happened , the break with Burke came at a bad time for the Whigs . In the month following the quarrel between Burke and Fox , Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette attempted their flight to Varennes and were brought back to Paris as prisoners . The French Revolution accelerated until it vindicated  --  fully by 1792-93  --  what had been regarded as the alarmist picture which Burke had painted in the Reflections . The Whigs , who had rejected the author of the Reflections , had cut themselves off from British public opinion because of their enthusiasm for the Revolution in France . II . Insight Amounting to Prophecy <p> I HAVE considered , so far , the genesis of the Reflections and its immediate consequences in British politics . I shall now consider the content of the work itself . <p> The book began as a letter , addressed to " a very young gentleman " in Paris , who had asked Burke for reassurance regarding the future course of the French Revolution . Burke 's original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1789 , explains , calmly and courteously , why he can not provide the desired reassurance . Burke tells his French correspondent : " You may have subverted Monarchy , but not recover 'd freedom . . . You are now to live in a new order of things ; under a plan of Government of which no Man can speak from experience . . . The French may be yet to go through more transmigrations . " <p> Those three sentences are developed at length in the Reflections , which is also still , in form , a letter to the same correspondent . But the Reflections is in other respects very different , in character and tone , from the original letter . In the interim , from mid January 1790 on , Burke had learned of those " proceedings of certain societies " in London , in which unrestricted admiration for the French Revolution was expressed and a desire to emulate it in England was implied . <p> Burke felt great alarm and anger at those proceedings , and having denounced them , from his place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to write a tract to warn the British public against the dangers of any such tendencies . That tract , in the form of a letter , is the Reflections . <p> Burke 's passionate indignation against the French Revolution  --  and above all against any attempt to imitate it in the British Isles  --  is evident in the Reflections , sustains it , and is the source of a part of its power . But a part only . The text of the Reflections takes up nearly three hundred pages . I reckon that 90 per cent of that consists of argument and analysis . There is an emotional undercurrent throughout , but it breaks through to the surface only rarely . When it does the resultant rhetoric is spectacular . The most spectacular  --  that about the Queen of France , as Burke saw her in 1773  --  has been quoted far more often than anything else in the book . Repetition of this quotation has created the misleading impression that the Reflections is mostly gorgeous rhetoric . In reality , most of the book is made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Burke keeps it well under control , except on the rare occasions when he decides not to do so . <p> The grand distinguishing feature of the Reflections is the power of Burke 's insight into the character of the French Revolution , then at an early stage . This insight is so acute as to endow him with prophetic power . He sees what way the Revolution is heading . No one else seems to have done so at the time . The spring and summer of 1790  --  the period in which Burke wrote the Reflections  --  was the most tranquil stage , in appearance , in the history of the Revolution . It was a period of constitution-making , of benevolent rhetoric , and of peaceful jubilation , as in the Declaration de Paix au Monde on May 21 , 1790 , or the Fete de la Federation on July 14 , 1790 , celebrating the first anniversary of the fall of the Bastille . <p> Contemplating that attractive scene , in the spring and summer of 1790 , most people seem to have assumed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that remained was to reap its benign consequences . Burke sensed that the Revolution was only beginning . In the penultimate paragraph of the Reflections , Burke warned that the French " commonwealth " could hardly remain in the form it had taken in 1790 : " But before its final settlement it may be obliged to pass , as one of our poets says , through great varieties of untried being , ' and in all its transmigrations to be purified by fire and blood . " <p> Reading the Reflections with an undergraduate class in New York in the 1960s , I found that my students assumed that the direst events of the Revolution  --  the September Massacres , the Terror , the executions of the King and Queen  --  had already taken place when the Reflections was written . In reality , those events all lay in the future . And yet there is a sense in which those events are already present in the Reflections . They are present in the sense that the ferocious dynamic which Burke ascribes to the Revolution , even in 1790 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Burke foresaw not merely " transmigrations , fire , and blood . " In a remarkable passage  --  on page 342 of the Penguin Classics edition  --  Burke foresaw how those transmigrations would end up , in military despotism : <p> It is known , that armies have hitherto yielded a very precarious and uncertain obedience to any senate , or popular authority ; and they will least of all yield it to an assembly which is to have only a continuance of two years . The officers must totally lose the characteristic disposition of military men , if they see with perfect submission and due admiration , the dominion of pleaders ; especially when they find , that they have a new court to pay to an endless succession of those pleaders , whose military policy , and the genius of whose command ( if they should have any ) must be as uncertain as their duration is transient . In the weakness of one kind of authority , and in the fluctuation of all , the officers of an army will remain for some time mutinous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understands the art of conciliating the soldiery , and who possesses the true spirit of command , shall draw the eyes of all men upon himself . Armies will obey him on his personal account . There is no other way of securing military obedience in this state of things . But the moment in which that event shall happen , the person who really commands the army is your master ; the master ( theft is little ) of your king , the master of your assembly , the master of your whole republic . <p> The seizure of power by Napoleon Bonaparte  --  the event predicted in this remarkable passage  --  occurred on 18 brumaire 1799 , nine years after the publication of the Reflections , and more than two years after the death of the author . <p> Burke 's astonishing capacity to see into the ways in which events were moving derived , not from any mystical intuition , but from penetrating powers of observation , judicious inference from what was observed , and thorough analysis of what was discerned by observation and inference . Burke had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attentiveness . There is a passage about circumstances in relation to liberty which occurs very near the beginning of the Reflections ( pages 89-91 in the Penguin Classics edition ) , and is fundamental to Burke 's political thinking , not alone in the Reflections , but generally . In this passage Burke is referring to the congratulations conveyed by the English Revolution Society to the French National Assembly , in November 1789 , on France 's achievement of liberty . The passage runs : <p> I flatter myself that I love a manly , moral , regulated liberty as well as any gentleman of the Revolution Society ; be he who he will ; and perhaps I have given as good proofs of my attachment to that cause , in the whole course of my public conduct . I think I envy liberty as little as they do , to any other nation . But I can not stand forward , and give praise or blame to any thing which relates to human actions , and human concerns , on a simple view of the object , as it stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and solitude of metaphysical abstraction . Circumstances ( which with some gentlemen pass for nothing ) give in reality to every political principle its distinguishing colour , and discriminating effect . The circumstances are what render every civil and political scheme beneficial or noxious to mankind . Abstractedly speaking , government , as well as liberty , is good ; yet could I , in common sense , ten years ago , have felicitated France on her enjoyment of a government ( for she then had a government ) without enquiry what the nature of that government was , or how it was administered ? Can I now congratulate the same nation upon its freedom ? Is it because liberty , in the abstract may be classed amongst the blessings of mankind , that I am seriously to felicitate a madman , who has escaped from the protecting restraint and wholesome darkness of his cell , on his restoration to the enjoyment of light and liberty ? Am I to congratulate an highwayman and murderer , who has broke prison , upon the recovery of his natural rights ? This would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemned to the gallies , and their heroic deliverer , the metaphysic Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance . <p> When I see the spirit of liberty in action , I see a strong principle at work ; and this , for a while , is all I can possibly know of it . The wild gas , the fixed air is plainly broke loose : but we ought to suspend our judgment until the first effervescence is a little subsided , till the liquor is cleared , and until we see something deeper than the agitation of a troubled and frothy surface . I must be tolerably sure , before I venture publicly to congratulate men upon a blessing , that they have really received one . Flattery corrupts both the receiver and the giver ; and adulation is not of more service to the people than to kings . I should therefore suspend my congratulations on the new liberty of France , until I was informed how it had been combined with government ; with public force ; with the discipline and obedience of armies ; with the collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; with the solidity of property ; with peace and order ; with civil and social manners . All these ( in their way ) are good things too ; and , without them , liberty is not a benefit whilst it lasts , and is not likely to continue long . The effect of liberty to individuals is , that they may do what they please : We ought to see what it will please them to do , before we risque congratulations , which may be soon turned into complaints . Prudence would dictate this in the case of separate insulated private men ; but liberty , when men act in bodies , is power . Considerate people , before they declare themselves , will observe the use which is made of power ; and particularly of so trying a thing as new power in new persons , of whose principles , tempers , and dispositions , they have little or no experience , and in situations where those who appear the most stirring in the scene may possibly not be the real movers . III . The End @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reflections to our own time . 1990 was like 1790 in an important way . Both years were aftermaths of epochal changes . 1790 saw the first anniversary of the fall of the Bastille. 1990 saw the first anniversary of the destruction of the Berlin Wall . The 1990 anniversary was celebrated , as the 1790 anniversary was ( but not by Burke ) , as a feast of liberation . But the two versions of liberation are diametrically opposed . In July 1790 , what was being celebrated was the beginning of the Revolution in France . In November 1990 , what was celebrated was the undoing of the Communist Revolution . <p> In July 1790 , while France was celebrating the Feast of the Federation , and British friends of the French Revolution were celebrating in sympathy , Edmund Burke was at work on the great counter-revolutionary tract which was the Reflections on the Revolution in France . From the principles laid down in the Reflections , we know that Burke would have rejoiced at the destruction of the Berlin Wall and the comprehensive discredit of the Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revolution in France and the Revolution in Russia . That continuity is often denied  --  especially by French anti-Communists . Last year 's bicentenary celebrations in Paris were organized around the theme of universal liberation , supposedly inspired by the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen . As pageantry , the celebration was brilliantly successful . As history , it was nonsense . The edifying sentiments expressed in the Declaration had no influence over the conduct of the French Revolutionaries themselves , or of anybody else , anywhere . What that document influenced was other documents : principally , the constitutions of a number of Latin American countries , whose governments were , in practice , no more influenced by the edifying sentiments in question than the original French Revolutionaries had allowed themselves to be . <p> The true heirs to the French Revolution  --  and specifically to the Jacobin tradition  --  were the Communists . We can see this particularly clearly when we apply Burkean categories . What Burke most detested , and dreaded , about the French Revolutionaries was their commitment to radical social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accordance with theoretical prescriptions . In all that , Marx and Lenin are clearly heirs to the Jacobins . The only difference is that the commitment of the Marxists , in these respects , outdid that of the Jacobins . In every phase of the French Revolution , the Revolutionaries left private property intact , with just one great exception , bitterly denounced by Burke . That exception was the nationalization of the property of the Church , in November 1789 . What the Jacobins did to Church property , the Marxists did to almost all property . The result was the command economy , whose abject failure is now acknowledged in all the European lands which were unlucky enough to have been subjected to it . <p> What we have been witnessing in 1989-90 , in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe , is the bankruptcy of the greatest experiment in social and political innovation ever made . What stronger vindication could there be of the principles laid down , and the warning contained , in Reflections on the Revolution in France ? <p> Modern British society is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there is a clear continuity between the two . The society changed , politically and socially , not through any burst of innovation , but through a series of partial reforms , as Burke hoped it would do . The heritage of the great French innovative effort was not so happy . The Revolution and its consequences left the French a deeply divided people throughout the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth . After 1917 , those of the French who felt themselves to be in the tradition of their own great Revolution flocked to the French Communist Party . In the Second World War , the fact that the party of the working-class ( as the French Communist Party then still was ) was opposed to the war-effort  --  because of the Stalin-Hitler pact  --  was among the reasons for the fall of France . <p> From 1970 on , however , the Revolutionary heritage , which had bedeviled the French for so long , went into decline , as did the French Communist Party . The 1989 celebration of the bicentenary was essentially a gorgeous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revolution which is at last over , though it took nearly two centuries for it to die . <p> One of the consequences of the decline of the cult of the French Revolution in France itself has been the emergence of a new respect for Edmund Burke , and for the Reflections in particular , among French historians . For many years the dominant school of French historians were really the priests of a cult of the great Revolution . As long as that was the case , the author of Reflections on the Revolution in France  --  ce livre infame , as Michelet called it  --  was necessarily anathema . French historians of today take quite a different view . The monumental Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution , edited by Francois Furet and Mona Ozouf and published in 1988 , contains an entry on Burke by Gerard Gengembre which concludes with a tribute to his " penetrating clairvoyance , revealing the depths of what was at stake in the Revolution . " There are many other references to Burke , and his name is cross-listed in at least 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication of a new French translation of the Reflections-together with a selection of Burke 's other writings on the Revolution  --  with a weighty and profoundly respectful preface by Philippe Raynaud ( who was also a contributor to the Critical Dictionary ) . Raynaud describes the author of the Reflections as " liberal and counter-revolutionary , " which is exactly right . <p> British scholarship is less respectful toward the author of the Reflections than French scholarship now is . At least that is the conclusion toward which one would be impelled by comparing Raynaud 's edition with the corresponding English publication of the same year : Volume VIII ( The French Revolution , 1790-1794 ) of The Writings and Speeches of Edmund Burke ( Clarendon Press , Oxford ) ; Volume VIII is edited by L. G. Mitchell . Raynaud 's preface provides 105 pages of respectful interpretation and comment , ending with a tribute to Burke 's " incomparable art . " Mitchell gives us 51 pages of disparagement and depreciation , interspersed with a veritable anthology of sneers directed at Burke by his numerous enemies . If Mitchell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any merit , he nowhere reveals this . He thinks of Burke as a failure . His preface ends with the words : " For him there was only the bitterness of the dishonored prophet . " <p> A quirky introduction might be excused if the edition were otherwise satisfactory . It is in fact lamentably defective . It is hard to believe , but this volume of The Writings and Speeches of Edmund Burke contains no speeches at all ; only writings . Yet some of Burke 's most important speeches were made on the subject  --  the French Revolution  --  with which Volume VIII is supposed to be concerned , and fall within its chronological limits : 1790-1794 . The relevant speeches omitted include the series which culminated in the breach between Edmund Burke and Charles James Fox ( referred to above ) . It seems almost inconceivable that these speeches could be omitted from the relevant volume of a scholarly series entitled The Writings and Speeches of Edmund Burke . The two volumes previously published in this series gave their readers what those readers were entitled to expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightly  --  a number of speeches which are of little importance compared with a number of those omitted from Volume VIII . This miserable edition also omits one of Burke 's major writings on the French Revolution , the great Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs , which is the sequel and justification of the Reflections . <p> If this series is to retain its previously high reputation , Volume VIII should be withdrawn from circulation , and a new Volume VIII prepared , to the same standards as were followed in Volumes II and V. <p> TURNING AWAY , with relief , from Volume VIII , let me conclude with one of the most remarkable passages in the Reflections . It is a passage which is highly relevant to the present scene in the former empire of Communism , and to some of the forces which are trying to fill the vacuum left by the collapse of Communism . It is , in effect , a treatise on the versatility of evil : <p> We do not draw the moral lessons we might from history . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our minds and to destroy our happiness .

History consists , for the greater part , of the miseries brought upon the world by pride , ambition , avarice , revenge , lust , sedition , hypocrisy , ungoverned zeal , and all the train of disorderly appetites , which shake the public with the same troubled storms that toss The private state , and render life unsweet . <p> These vices are the causes of those storms .

You would not cure the evil by resolving , that there should be no more monarchs , nor ministers of state , nor of the gospel ; no interpreters of law ; no general officers ; no public councils . You might change the names . The things in some shape must remain . A certain quantum of power must always exist in the community , in some hands , and under some appellation . Wise men will apply their remedies to vices , not to names ; to the causes of evil which are permanent , not to the occasional organs by which they act , and the transitory modes in which they appear . Otherwise you will be wise historically , a fool in practice . Seldom have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same modes of mischief . Wickedness is a little more inventive . Whilst you are discussing fashion , the fashion is gone by . The very same vice assumes a new body . The spirit transmigrates ; and , far from losing its principle of life by the change of its appearance , it is renovated in its new organs with the fresh vigour of a juvenile activity . It walks abroad ; it continues its ravages ; whilst you are gibbeting the carcass , or demolishing the tomb . You are terrifying yourself with ghosts and apparitions , whilst your house is the haunt of robbers . It is thus with all those , who attending only to the shell and husk of history , think they are waging war with intolerance , pride , and cruelty , whilst , under colour of abhorring the ill principles of antiquated parties , they are authorizing and feeding the same odious vices in different factions , and perhaps in worse . <p> Those last four words should be borne in mind as we contemplate some of the patterns emerging in the disintegrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambitious and sustained innovative effort in human history . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : The Queen of France , Marie-Antoinette . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : A version of Robespierre , from the cover of NATIONAL , REVIEW , July 14 , 1989 . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Original title : " The Zenith of French Glory : The Pinnacle of Liberty .
