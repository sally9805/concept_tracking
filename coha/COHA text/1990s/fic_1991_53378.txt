YOUV'E GOT BUYERS and you 've got sellers . Buyers come here looking for the things they 've always wanted but which any place else they could n't afford to pay the price . And sellers  --  they come to salvage what they can out of too much dreaming . Buyers and sellers , they do n't want to know each other . My job is to keep them apart . Buyers do n't want to believe they 're getting what someone else could n't afford to keep . And sellers want to think they 're selling to a kind of museum , that no one 'll ever use what they 're unloading . A bit of their life , hung up here , or put in a case , forever . I 'm in the middle . I keep them apart . And I know what things are really worth . Things 're not dreams . I pay for only the thing . And I sell the same , at a higher price . <p> The other day this guy comes in looking for a car stereo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , got an earring , got a friend looks just like him . These two guys , I give you odds , blow more money on booze and coke in a week than the best car stereo down at Al 's Audio 'd cost . But here they are , in my door , smelling of their parents ' money but right away I can tell going to try to talk me down . They come in smiling , like they own the place . Not smiling at me . Just smiling . " Got any car stereos ? " the one says . He 's hardly in the door . He 's got his hands in his back pockets . Not a hello , not a how-are-you . Just " got any car stereos . " <p> I point . " In the case , " I say . " They 're all marked . " <p> I go back to watching one of the TV 's I got in . They find the case , and they 're both over it , bending over the speakers and amplifiers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , the sun like bubbling oil , and most everyone stands still when they come in , getting used to the dark . She does that , too , but with her I can tell right away she 's a seller not a buyer . Not that I can always tell . But with her I can . She stands still , and it 's not just the dark that 's bothering her . She 's thinking . I take a good look at her . She 's not bad looking . Not great , but not bad . Maybe her mouth 's a bit big . Maybe just a bit overweight , but that 's all right . <p> I think for a moment she 's going to turn and head back out , but then she catches me looking . She nods , tries to smile , and then her face-it 's kind of like leaves falling inside it  --  it settles into something bare and determined . She comes across the floor ; she 's got on flat , soft-soled shoes-she makes no sound . Some women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . You can always tell a dancer , but I 'm not talking about that . A dancer 'll walk like water in a clear , curving pipe . But this woman , she 's more like a lot of rain on the street , like oh Lord , look at it go , and still more coming . <p> So she does that over to me . I let myself have the luxury of thinking all this for a while . Then ! shut it down when she gets close . I 'm wondering what it is she 's got to sell , nothing I can see . Over at the case , the two earrings have pulled a couple of systems out and are inspecting them . The short one lifts up the price tag on one and kind of grins at the other . They both shake their heads . I hate it when people do that . As if they know anything . <p> But then she 's standing in front of me , reaching into her purse . " Hi , " she says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> She fumbles around some , impatient now she 's mentioned it , and nervous I can tell , and frustrated with herself . Then she brings it out and I think oh shit , it would have to be , and she lays a ring case on the counter . <p> You 'd be surprised , I always am , at how many women save their ring cases . Like they 're expecting some day they 're going to have to put the rings back into them and take them somewhere . Like they expect it . I reach down and open the case , and I 'm looking down at a set , engagement and wedding . All polished , all taken care of . <p> " So you want to sell them , " I say . <p> " Say ! " the tall kid in back yells across the room to me . " Could We maybe install the Pioneer here ? See how it sounds in the car ? " <p> " Excuse me , " I say quietly to the woman . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Let him think he 's putting me out . Once he gets that system installed , he 's not going to want to take it out much . I probably make fifty bucks just by letting him put it in . Finally I yell back : " All right . I guess that 's all right . " <p> " You got some tools ? " <p> Do I have some tools ? I got thirteen different tool sets , what 's he think ? I point . I turn back to the woman . " So , " I say . <p> " So , " she says . We both stare down at the rings . <p> " What will you give me ? " <p> I pick the wedding band up , hold it up to the light so I can see inside it . " Lorraine and Lyle . Forever . 7/22/78 . " So Lorraine had a forever eleven years long . I stick the ring back in the case . Fourteen carat gold . The engagement ring has a twenty-five-point diamond . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge for the dream . This set 'd probably go fifteen-hundred retail . But I do n't buy the dream back . Maybe I 'd go three hundred . If she really pushes me.She 's not going to like it . <p> I get out the scale . The wedding ring comes to three grams . I get out my wholesale book , thumb through it . She does n't move . Does n't even fidget . Just stands there . <p> I lay the book down . I tell her : " It 's three grams of gold ; it 's a twenty-five point diamond . I 'll go five a gram for the gold , three a point for the diamond . Say a hundred dollars . " <p> She looks at me . She does n't say a word . She looks at me . She 's really not very pretty , but she 's got brown eyes , light brown , almost the color of brick . Eyes the color of bright brick and a walk like water running under its own rain . What the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But it 's not my problem . She brought it in here ; that 's my price . " Look , " I say . " You think about it . I 've got to check on something . " <p> I stick my head out the door . Down the street there 's a black Camaro . One of the earrings is in the backseat setting the speakers up , and the other one is lying half in and half out of the car , with his feet stretched out on the sidewalk . I note the license number . <p> When I come back in , she 's still standing there . I go around to the back of the counter again . She looks at me just like she did before . <p> " I want five hundred and fifty dollars , " she says . <p> " I ca n't give you that , " I say . " Two hundred . Maybe . " <p> She shakes her head . " Five hundred fifty . " <p> " Look , " I say . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " No you do n't , " she says . It 's like she just woke up . Her voice is cutting . " Why do you say you know ? You do n't . " <p> Then just like that she stops , and something fades through her , and she 's tired again . " You do n't know , " she repeats but just stating it this time . " I need five hundred and fifty . " <p> It makes me kind of mad . I did n't ask her to come here with her troubles . I 'm not trying to rip her off ; I just know what something 's worth to me . I feel like saying to her : Do you know who buys used jewelry ? Old men and women tourists . They 're looking for deals , and they have no illusions about this stuff . They do n't know what it means to you and they do n't care , because they 've been through it all and once is enough , and they 're just stocking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it , " I say . <p> She shakes her head , like she 's the one doing the refusing , like I 'm asking her for something . At first I think it 's just a gesture , but she looks me in the eye and says , " No . " She says : " That 's no good . " Her hand goes out over the counter , and I think she 's going to pick the rings up and leave , and I think , What a crazy woman , no wonder Lyle left her , if she thinks she 's depriving me of a chance to buy these , if she thinks I 'm going to stop her . <p> But she does n't pick the rings up . Her hand just hangs over them . It 's pale and light-veined . It looks almost like a leaf that 's started to fall but then stops in midair and hangs there , like saying , Screw you gravity . I 'm looking at her hand , and she says : " Eleven hundred dollars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know how many times he told me . Bragged about it . And I was impressed . I was . I thought he was something . " <p> Then she says : " I want half now . That 's all . " <p> Is she deaf ? I 'm almost glad to see the shorter earring pop in the door . " Got a Phillips screwdriver ? " he yells . " Over there . " <p> He rummages in the pile , chooses one , leaves . " Look , " I say to the woman . I reach into my cash box underneath the counter and pull up six fifty-dollar bills . " There 's three hundred . That 's more than I can afford . That 's generous . A gift . Take it or leave it . " <p> She does n't even look at the money . " He went on a business trip , " she says . " A year ago . He had a round-trip ticket . He only used half of it . " <p> She lets her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care to hear her story . But she 's looking at me , expecting something . " That 's too bad , " I say . " Tough . " <p> " Did you know , " she asks me , " that it 's cheaper to buy a round-trip ticket to someplace than to buy a one-way ? It 's actually cheaper . " <p> " Look , " I say , and I 'm trying to be nice . " There 's three hundred dollars . It 's more than you 'll get anywhere else . " <p> " I know , " she tells me . <p> " OK , then , " I say . And I 'm reaching for the ring case . <p> " No , " she says . " I need five fifty . " <p> I stare at her . Those eyes are looking right back at me . I look down and see my own hand hanging over the rings like hers did before . I hate it when I 'm too sure to close a deal . I stick my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . " Two days ago he called me . From Tucson . He made a mistake , he told me . He says he knows it now . He wants to get back together . What do you think ? " <p> I think I want her out of my shop . I think she 's one of these people who think their own troubles are more important than anything . But before I can answer , she says : " You know what I think ? I think whoever it was got sick of him . So he 'll just come back to me . In three weeks , he told me . He 'll wrap things up down there and come back . We 'll talk things over , he said . We 'll work things out . " <p> She gives me a look that tells me it 's kind of unlikely Lyle 's going to get a big reception . " You know what I told him ? " she asks . <p> " To go to hell ? " I suggest . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . Come back . I told him he knows where the house is . " <p> " Well , good luck , " I say . What else can I say ? <p> " Oh , " she says . " I did n't tell him I 'd be here . " <p> I just look at her . <p> " That 's why I need five fifty for these , " she says , nodding at the ring case . " It all works out . A one-way ticket , a tint-class ticket , from here to Tucson is five hundred and forty . I checked . If he can wrap things up in three weeks , so can I. Then I find out when he 's leaving , and I take a plane so we pass each other in the air . What do you think ? " <p> " What do I think ? " I repeat . <p> Just then the larger of the two earrings sticks his head in the door . " Say ! " he yells . " We ca n't get this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I say . " I 'll be out . It works . " <p> " Well yes , " she says as soon as I turn back to her . " Once I realized a one-way ticket was half the price of this ring set . That ca n't just be coincidence , can it ? " <p> " But , " I say , " there 's coach . Or if a round-trip is cheaper why do n't you ... ? " <p> She looks at me like I 'm some kind of moron , and I do n't push the point . " All right , " I say . " I agree . It all works out . Cute . So Lyle comes back and Lorraine 's not here . Lorraine 's where Lyle 's been . Flying on a wedding band . " <p> She looks surprised . " How do you know our names ? " she asks . <p> So . She can be stupid , too . All right . " You must have told me , " I say . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look into mine . They 're bright and brown . " Did I tell you ? " <p> I shrug . I act dumb . She believes it . Her look relaxes a bit . " Well anyway , " she says , " when he comes back he 's going to find taped to the door a copy of my airline receipt . With the destination cut out . But the price circled . And next to it a pawn receipt . For two rings . Do you think he 'll figure it out ? " <p> " I do n't know Lyle , " I say . " But if he does n't , he 's too dumb for it to matter . But there 's a problem . " ' <p> " Yes ? " <p> " You 'll have to circle three hundred on my receipt . " I nod at the money . <p> " Five fifty , " she says . <p> " Uhn-uh , " I say . <p> " Ah-hahn . " <p> " Then we 've got nothing to talk about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't move . She stands there . She stands there staring at me like she 's stil <p> l expecting something . " It 's been interesting , " I say . She does n't reply . She stands there . <p> " Well , I 've got to check on those two , " I say . " Sorry I could n't help . " <p> She does n't say anything . She just kind of flicks her fingers , like saying I can go , like I need her dismissal . <p> The two earrings are standing around waiting for me . My tools are scattered all over the sidewalk . It 's getting near to closing time but it 's still hot . They 've hooked the tape deck up wrong , and I have to stick my head under the dashboard to find where the wires ought to go . By the time I get out from there , the back of my shirt is soaked . I turn the ignition on . There 's a tape in the deck , so I push it in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " There , " I say . " It works . " <p> They 're grinning . " Yeah , " the taller one says . " Yeah . " <p> Then he asks : " Could we maybe drive around with it a while ? See how it sounds that way ? " <p> " Hey , " I say . " I 've got your license number . " <p> They grin some more . They think I 'm joking . " OK , " I tell them . " But pick these tools up . And I close in half an hour . You 're not back by then , I call the cops . " <p> I go back in the shop . She 's still standing there . Just standing . Has n't moved . Does n't move when I go around the counter . Does n't even turn her head . I come right in front of her . Her eyes then flick into mine . That 's all that moves . They 're big and brown . They 're bright . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit , what 's she going to do , try to rob me now ? Is she crazy enough for that ? <p> " You 're still here , " I tell her . " You want the three hundred , then ? " <p> No reply . She just stands there . <p> " Lorraine , " I say , " what are you doing ? " <p> Nothing . <p> I get the three hundred bucks out again and lay them on the counter . " There , " I say . " There it is . " I reach out for the rings . She lets me take them . She does n't move . <p> I put the rings on a shelf behind me , but when I turn back to her , she still has n't moved . Has n't picked up the money . It 's still lying there . <p> She 's making me edgy . I ca n't tell what she 's up to . Her eyes are looking right at me , and they 're a little fearful-looking , but they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And not a muscle is moving , not anywhere . And those eyes : it 's more than just fear . There 's something really angry in them , too . Something really pissed off . <p> I tap the pile of money with my finger . " Take it , " I say . <p> She just goes on staring at me . She 's heard me , I can tell that , but she just goes on staring . <p> " All right , then , damn it , " I say . I turn around and take the ring case off the shelf and lay it down hard on the counter . " Have your rings back . One or the other . " <p> Her mouth sets real hard then . It 's the first movement I 've seen from her since I came back in . Just a tightening of her lips , until they 're like a wire stretched across her face . Her eyes just go on glaring at me . <p> But that 's all . I ca n't believe it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cute , Lorraine , " I say . " Real funny . Except I do n't see the humor . How about this ? If you 're not out of here when I close , I call the cops . They can drag you out . How 's that for funny ? " <p> But it does n't faze her . It 's like she 's turning into stone in front of me , except for her eyes . They 're brighter all the time . They 're the color of brick , but there 's nothing like stone about them . <p> I put both hands on the counter and look right into her face . " Come on , Lorraine , " I say . " You do n't want the cops to haul you out . Come on . Take the three hundred . I 'll give you a receipt for five fifty . You can stick that on your door . Lyle 'll still get the message . " <p> Nothing . Nothing at all . She stares right back at me . <p> I push myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the shelves behind me . I throw up my hands and walk away from her . " Fine , " I yell . " Fine then . " I walk out into the middle of the shop . " I 've done what I can . You want to get arrested , that 's up to you . If you think I wo n't do it , think again . " <p> I go to the window , stare out , give her time to think . The sun 's so bright out there , it hurts my eyes . I have to squint . I look out for a long time . <p> When I turn back , she still has n't moved . She 's still looking over the counter , waiting . I look at her back . It 's so dim up there where she 's standing that she looks black . She looks solid . She looks like some statue I got in , something made of cement and painted black , some mistake in judgment I made that I 'll never unload on anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like something that 'll be standing in front of that counter till hell freezes over . Like something even the cops could n't move , and if they did , she 'd be there again in the morning . She looks like something that if they bulldozed the place , just knocked it over , all that would be left standing when the dust began to settle would be Lorraine . Just standing . Waiting for her five fifty . <p> It gets to me . I 'm used to people arguing . I 'm used to people yelling . I 'm used to people bursting out in rage and names . Fine : I can handle that . I 've been called about any name you can think of , maybe some you ca n't . I can handle that , too . Because I 'm the one who owns the door . No one has to come in here and no one has to stay . It 's always me who knows what I will or wo n't take or pay . " You might try someone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seeing movement , in their minds , toward my view of things , or in their bodies , going out my door . <p> But there she stands . It 's like she picked me out . It 's like she 's been coming toward me ever since Lyle left . There are half a dozen pawn shops I could name she could have picked . But she picks me . She comes through my door like water running , and turns to rock inside my walls . She plops her dream down on the counter and says : Give me half of it . And turns to stone . <p> Good Christ ! I 'm not a jerk . I got two grown kids myself ; I 've never cheated on my wife . I give to CARE and March of Dimes . What right 's she got to come in here and make me feel guilty ? What right 's she got to make me be the one who decides to call the cops ? I do n't send people to jail . I buy and sell stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn thing . That 's the point . That 's moral , damn it . I 'm more moral than any customer I get . What screws the world up is people making things mean something , making them more than things . How many trees would we save each year if jerks with lots of money did n't build houses with sixteen extra rooms just to mean for their neighbors : I got it and you do n't . And then not even live there , eat all their meals out , spend all their time away , and send their kids to day care all day and half the night , so they grow up and get hooked on drugs . My kids never did drugs . My son never got a girl pregnant , never used her up and dumped her . My daughter never had a cocaine baby . And you know why ? Because they knew a thing was a thing and a person was a person . They knew the difference . I had them work down here , and they knew the difference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddamn motorcycle I bought , or some Nintendo game . <p> So what right 's she got to make me into the jerk here , to make me feel like I got no morals , like nothing counts for me but money ? Money does n't count squat with me . That 's what nobody who walks in here ever sees . They all think my bottom line is money ; they think they 're the ones who have superior morals . It never occurs to them that it 's a hell of a lot more moral to keep the balance even , to say a gram of gold is worth what it 's worth than to say it 's worth a dream , to say it 's worth love , to say it 's worth forever . Money is n't the root of evil . Pretending money and things mean something is . <p> Something real big and angry finally jumps in me , thinking all this . She 's trying to make me think because she is n't moving , she is n't making a choice . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her decision . Not mine . She thinks she can come in here and plop herself down inside my shop and work extortion on me . Well , I 'm a citizen , too . I got rights , Lorraine , Let me show you . <p> I walk back up to where she is . I do n't look at her . I go around the counter to the phone . I keep my back to her and check the police number taped to the wall . " I 'm calling the police , " I say . " It 's past closing now , and you 're trespassing . " <p> She can hear the beeps as I dial , I know she can . I turn around to look at her while the phone is ringing . She 's looking at me . She is n't moving , but she is looking at me . I stare back . The phone rings once . It rings twice . Lorraine is scared , I can see it . I bet she 's never had a speeding ticket . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She wo n't move . Four rings  --  hell , what if this were an emergency ? She 's scared , but she wo n't move . Her eyes are scared , but they 're angry , too ; they 're set , they 're determined , they 're accusing me  --  as if I picked her out . Good Lord ! They 're blazing at me . <p> All she 's got to do is walk out the door with what she came in with . <p> " Police . " <p> I damn near jump . I never heard the receiver get picked up . All of a sudden there 's this voice , demanding something from me . I ca n't talk . I 'm staring at Lorraine , and she 's staring back , she 's letting me do it , she 's letting me get her arrested ; she 's just standing there , she picked me out , and there she is , and now I got this voice expecting me to do something about it . <p> I ca n't talk . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yell . I spin away from the phone and bang my hands on the counter . The glass rings and shakes . Lorraine just stares at me . " All right ! " I yell . " All right , I 'll give you your five fifty . Your lousy money , I 'll give it to you . " <p> I grab the cash box , almost tip over the shelves I 'm so pissed she made me do this . I bend the hinges on the box I open it so hard , and that just makes me madder . I tip the whole damn box upside down on the counter in front of her . " There , " I yell . " That 's everything I got . Take it all as far as I care . If money means so damn much to you , take it all . If you 'd rather go to jail than not have your money , take it all . " <p> She moves . First her whole face kind of softens and breaks apart . She shuts her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just stare at her . I stare at her face . Because for the first time I see how hurt she is there . I see how much she 's been controlling herself . Her lips are squeezed tight , but they 're trembling a little , and her whole face is moving . It 's like leaves falling and falling and falling in it . I 'm kind of awestruck , that she 's had all this going on since she came in , and never let it show . Her eyes squeeze real tight . <p> And then they open . They 're bright and brown . They 're seeing me . And I realize by the way they 're looking that they 're not seeing an angry face . It 's all gone . It 's just me and her . We 're looking at each other . <p> " Thank you , " she says . She really means it . <p> I ca n't quite believe what 's happening yet . I look down at the counter . I shake my head . <p> Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It pauses . I look up . She 's watching her own hand . Her face has gone tight again . It 's like she 's waiting to see what her hand will do . Or like she has to force it down . After all this . <p> Then it drops , finds five hundreds and one fifty , and comes away with it . She puts it in her purse . She looks up at me . " Damn , " she murmurs . She tries to smile , does n't do it very well , shrugs . " He really did impress me , " she says . " You know . " <p> I nod . Suddenly she reaches out and grabs my hand . She squeezes it hard . I squeeze back . What else can I do ? <p> " I do n't even know your name , " she says . " What is it ? " <p> " Ed , " I tell her . " Ed 's Pawn ? " <p> " Oh . " She really does smile this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " No . A lot of people ... " <p> She nods . She squeezes my hand again , two quick pulses . " Well , the receipt , then , " she says . <p> It 's almost timid the way she says it . She 's something else . I give her hand one more squeeze then let go and make out the receipt . I even circle the price for her . She takes it , puts it in her purse . <p> " Ed ? " she says . " <p> Yeah ? " <p> " What do you do ... ? " <p> I see where she 's looking . " Oh , " I say , " they 're melted down . The stone 's taken out . Sold separately . " <p> Her eyes are looking into mine , straight and unmoving . She catches her lower lip in her teeth , nods just a small nod . " You 're sweet , " she says . <p> That 's a new one . She stands a moment , uncertain what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , good-bye , Ed , " she says . <p> I take her hand . We shake . " Good-bye , Lorraine . " Then I say . ' . " Would you have let the cops haul you out ? Really ? " <p> She looks at me . It 's probably only a couple seconds , but it seems a lot longer . " Yes , " she finally says . " . And I would have been back in the morning . " <p> She smiles and it makes me smile . I think : Well , if I can lie for her , maybe she 's returning the favor . <p> Or maybe not . <p> " Why me ? " I ask . <p> She shrugs . " The Yellow Pages . You were first on the page . " <p> It 's something of a relief . At least I know she has n't tried this with five others who were able to resist her . <p> She drops my hand . Her eyes look at me a moment longer . Then she turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and down the sidewalk past the window . Then she 's gone . <p> I 'm alone . I stand there a while , thinking . Then I realize it 's late . It 's a half-hour past closing . I 'm turning the " OPEN " sign around in the window when I hear drums and screaming coming toward me , and the Camaro sways around the corner . <p> I forgot all about them . They hop out and march into the shop . Before they can say anything , I say : " You 're late . I should have called the cops . I gave you guys a break . " It 's always good to get the jump when you have the chance . <p> They shrug and shuffle . " Sorry , " the taller one says . Then he says : " The system 's OK , I guess . " <p> Bullshit . He loves it . I can tell . <p> " Will you take a hundred and fifty for it ? " he asks . That 's fifty less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it , " I tell him . " I 've got it as low as I can go on that one . Two hundred . " <p> He looks at his friend . They do n't know what to say . They figured they 'd take me down . Like I thought . " Well , that 's too much , " he finally says . It 's not too convincing . <p> " If you think so . I do n't . " <p> They shuffle some more . I could make them see the barrel I have them over . I could say : Two hundred dollars , or take it out again . You know where the tools are . <p> It 's tempting . It sure is tempting . But hell . They 're just kids . Probably never done this before . I can get two hundred and maybe make them feel OK about it , too . " Look , " I say . " The deal 's good . You wo n't get a system like that anywhere for that price . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use it tonight already . Impress the girls . Who knows ? " <p> They grin at that . " Well , OK , " the taller one finally says . " I 'll go two hundred . If you 'll give me a three-month guarantee . " <p> That surprises me . He 's got more in reserve than I thought . Still , it 'd be nothing to talk him out of it . He 's sold . I never give guarantees . This is used stuff . <p> I think about it a second or two . My heart 's not in a no . <p> A guarantee : that it will last . " One month , " I say . " I 'll go one month . On a system like that , it 's as good as forever . " <p> <p> By KENT MEYERS <p>
