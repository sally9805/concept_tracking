<p> Anthony Wynn stepped off the school bus , his face red with anger . On the ride home from Southside High School , a schoolmate called him a " punk " one time too many . <p> A fistfight broke out . A crowd gathered to watch on the bald , littered hills of the Englewood Manor housing project . Anthony 's schoolmate had a tough reputation and , who knew , the way these things turn out , 16-year-old Anthony could end up dead . <p> A pall fell over Anthony 's mother , Teresa Wynn , when word of the fight reached her . She half-jogged down the long sidewalk , parted the crowd , grabbed Anthony 's thick arm and slapped his face . <p> " I told him to walk away when some crazy boy wants to fight , " Teresa said . <p> Not all of her children 's problems can be cured with a slap . She struggles to get her boys to do better than she did . <p> She faces daunting challenges . To be black and male , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in an at-risk population . It gets no easier growing up without fathers , trying to overcome learning disabilities with little help outside the classroom , coming home to a world where drug dealers run the playground and violence comes and goes like the breeze . <p> Teresa says Anthony should 've known better than to start a fight . At least two murderers are in the family album . His mother 's half-brother shot a boy dead while gunning for a man in Englewood Manor . <p> A year later , the father of her half sister 's first child shot and killed a man during a fight there . <p> ' He 's going to be better ' <p> Of Teresa 's four sons , Anthony is the most troubled . His school grades are poor , but his street sense is keen . <p> Although he has trouble in school with subjects such as math , he knows the value of cocaine . His father , Steve Hudson , taught him that before going to prison for selling the drug . <p> " I 'm afraid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sells drugs out here . He sees his friends making money , and he 's going to want to do it . " <p> Anthony , at 6-feet-1 and nearly 200 pounds , is hard to control . " I do a lot of things my mama do n't know about , " he said . <p> Then again , Anthony said , he 's no fool . <p> " I want to be better than my daddy . You have to watch your back too much , watch for police and stuff , " he said . <p> Teresa is relying on Anthony to set an example for his younger brothers , Darrell Jr. , 10 , Jarrod , 7 , and Branden , 4 . <p> " Too many kids are getting killed for stupid reasons , " Teresa said . " I do n't want my kids to get caught up in that . " <p> Anthony hopes professional basketball or football will improve his life . But his skills at age 16 have not advanced enough to place him on a varsity team . <p> Despite his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to college . " She 's gon na kick me out the house when I 'm 18 anyway , " Anthony said , pointing to his mother . " I really do n't have a choice . " <p> Teresa said Anthony must succeed in school if he wants to stay in her house . She insisted that he attend summer school this year and work a summer job . <p> " His grades are going to pick up , " Teresa said . " I wo n't allow him to follow in my footsteps . He 's going to be better than his mom is . " <p> Darrell looks up to Anthony . He , too , stakes his fortune in sports . He is strong , swift and bright . <p> Teresa said Darrell is most likely to survive the projects , whatever happens in her life . He is so smart , she crowed . <p> Teresa 's motherly concern about Darrell 's potential is why she 's so strict . When Darrell got into a fight one day , she was hot . <p> The fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruining his perfect attendance record through fourth grade . <p> Teresa sentenced Darrell to a beating as soon as he got home . <p> " Mama , I wo n't ever let it happen again , " Darrell screamed during his punishment . In every room of the house , his brothers were silent . <p> " A lot of Darrell 's problem is that his father lives right here in the neighborhood and do n't do nothing for him , " Teresa said . " He promises to do things , but do n't . <p> " Darrell acts his anger out . Anything can get his anger up . Someone says something to him he does n't like , he gets riled up . " <p> Anthony encourages Darrell to stand up for himself , even if it means fighting . He thinks he 's teaching his brother to be a man . <p> As the best reader in the family , Darrell has already taken on a man 's responsibility - reading homework to his brothers . <p> " I go to practice basketball and to games , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help Jarrod , or read homework to somebody , or show them how blocks are supposed to be shaped , " Darrell said . " I do n't always like it . " <p> Helping Jarrod is not easy . His attention span fluctuates like the wind . Until recently he took Ritalin , a drug prescribed for attention deficit disorder . <p> Jarrod 's hyperactivity keeps him from participating in sports . In school , he often disrupts classes . On his worst day , he punched a principal in the face . <p> He knows his mother means business . When a teacher reported that Jarrod refused to take his Ritalin , Teresa gave him a beating similar to Darrell 's . She believes the discipline will do more for him than any medication . <p> " The teachers say he needs a pill to sit down and do his work . I used to think he needed it , but I do n't anymore , " she said . <p> " Anthony was on Ritalin when he was small . I took him off , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether 4-year-old Branden escaped the attention deficit plague . Like any child discovering the wonders of his mouth and legs , he climbs everything , laughs and complains non-stop , and makes popping noises for his toy guns . <p> Branden 's three brothers believe he 's incredibly spoiled . The boys each have different fathers , but only Branden 's dad is ever-present , buying clothes for him and providing rides to day care . <p> The other boys rely on Teresa and themselves . Teresa does the best she can , such as purchasing secondhand clothes for them at a nearby thrift shop . <p> For Anthony , that is not enough . He turned to his father , Hudson , who had paid little attention to him until last year . <p> Hudson taught Anthony the art of cooking cocaine into crack . Anthony got jewelry through his father 's relatives and $ 500 from his father , and Teresa worried he would try to get other nice things by selling drugs . <p> " I thought he would get hooked on that stuff and he would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " Teresa said . " But I do n't worry about that anymore because Anthony 's father is locked up . " <p> Anthony said : " I think he was teaching me right . He said if I do n't make it in school , I do n't have to be no bum . I got ta sell drugs . " <p> ' I take care of myself ' <p> Darrell admires Anthony because he at least shared something with his father . During the rare times that Darrell 's father shows up , he mostly ignores his son 's existence , not to mention his pleas for a dollar or change . <p> Anthony does n't seem to know how much his brother looks up to him . When he got in the fight , he could n't see Darrell watching from about 100 yards away . A friend Darrell 's age stood by . <p> After Anthony 's mother stepped into the crowd , the other boy ran in long strides toward his house . Darrell 's friend spoke up . <p> " You know he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the friend told Darrell . Darrell sat riveted with his eyes and mouth wide open . <p> After the fight , Darrell cracked a joke : " So you got beat up , huh ? " <p> " No , " Anthony replied . " I 'm not like you . I take care of myself . " <p> Anthony may have been risking his life . The boy has a chrome-plated .38-caliber pistol . " I 've seen it before , " Anthony said . " He showed it to me . " <p> The family was gathered around Anthony when he admitted that . Teresa shook her head hopelessly . Darrell stared blankly at the floor . Jarrod asked for cookies . And young Branden played with his toy gun .
