<p> It was just a single number , one of thousands of hospital costs listed on a bulky document . But in it lay the heart of the scandal that has rocked the Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation . <p> Southwest Florida Regional Medical Center in Fort Myers , Fla. , had filed the document with the Government in 1991 seeking repayment for a portion of the money it spent while taking care of patients . And there , on the 14th page , Southwest claimed $68,000 more in property taxes than it had been assessed and had paid . <p> According to confidential papers , Southwest set aside the money it would have to return if the inflated number was detected . The risk was slight ; Government oversight was notoriously spotty . And even if the discrepancy was found , Southwest would merely have to repay the money  --  without fines or interest . <p> That , in microcosm , is the practice at the center of the far-reaching Federal investigation of Columbia , the world 's largest health care company and now the owner of Southwest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  sometimes both before and after the company acquired them  --  distorted expense claims to increase Federal reimbursement . <p> At times , as in the case of Southwest , it was as simple as plugging in a number higher than the real one . More frequently , the tactics were akin to illegally claiming a tax deduction by misrepresenting a family vacation as a business expense . <p> But the claims the Government is examining at Columbia do not involve just a few hundred dollars in air fare and hotel bills  --  the amounts stretch into the billions . With so much money at stake , Columbia , once considered almost invincible by competitors , has been shaken to its roots , abandoning both its longtime management team and its aggressive growth strategy . <p> Few details of the Government 's vast inquiry , involving hundreds of agents nationwide , have been publicly disclosed . Just three midlevel executives have been indicted on fraud charges relating to cost reporting at a single Florida hospital . Columbia has begun but not completed an internal inquiry . <p> The New York Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has recently obtained confidential records kept by Columbia hospitals in five states . The records show for the first time that certain hospitals camouflaged costs that were not reimbursable and then requested that Government health programs pick up the tab . After the hospitals were sure the trick had gone undetected for two to three years and the risk of a full audit had passed , the money could be counted as profits . <p> Details are revealed in shadow cost reports and related documents , which often present a cost picture quite different from the one provided to the Government . There is nothing illegal in keeping the second set of records , and many hospitals do so . Medicare rules are so complex , with so many gray areas for interpretation , that hospitals set money aside in case their reading of the regulations is later overruled by auditors . But it is illegal to use such records to set aside money to back cost claims that the hospitals know are not allowable . <p> The Times also conducted a computer analysis of cost filings by every hospital in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , to compare the reporting of the company 's hospitals with that of its competitors . <p> These were among The Times 's findings : <p> *Outside accountants , including KPMG Peat Marwick  --  one of the biggest firms in the business  --  knew that Columbia was deceiving the Government . In some instances they clearly abetted the deception . <p> *Supervisors told employees to hide documents that revealed how the hospital was disguising its costs so that its reimbursements could enhance profits in later years . At one Arkansas hospital , the records were ink-stamped : " CONFIDENTIAL . Do not discuss or release to Medicare auditors . " <p> *Taken as a whole , the pattern of costs in Texas and Florida that Columbia reported to the Government raises a red flag . Alone , these figures do not prove fraud . But the results of the computer analysis are consistent with an effort to inflate expenses . <p> *Misrepresentation of costs has occurred throughout the for-profit hospital industry . Hospitals now owned by Columbia distorted costs when they were owned by several other companies , including Healthtrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , Southwest was with Basic American when it inflated its property taxes . But the liability now rests with Columbia , which has drawn by far the greatest scrutiny . <p> After discussions with The Times over several weeks , Columbia chose not to comment on most of the issues raised from the confidential records , known as reserve cost reports , until after an audit by Deloitte &; Touche  --  which was recently hired to conduct an internal investigation . <p> As for the computer analysis , executives said they thought other factors in Columbia 's business might explain discrepancies between its hospitals and those of its rivals . <p> Still , Columbia plans to turn over The Times 's computer findings to Deloitte and will ask the accountants to review cost reports questioned by the paper , said Victor Campbell , a spokesman . <p> Mr. Campbell added that the events in question predated the July appointment of the former head of H.C.A. , Dr. Thomas Frist Jr. , as Columbia 's chairman and chief executive . Since then , Dr. Frist has stressed " zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its part , KPMG said the firm was cooperating with the Government but was not a target of the inquiry . <p> The Times investigation shows the ease of defrauding Medicare 's cost-reporting system , which is widely criticized for an unpredictability that verges on capriciousness . Rules are vague , critics say , and worse , are enforced by outside companies that often turn to recent college graduates to conduct field audits . Unsurprisingly , they often divine conflicting rule interpretations . Moreover , with it taking years to catch problems and with penalties rarely imposed , the price for fraud has been negligible . <p> " It 's a bizarre world , " said James Plonsey , president of Medicare Training and Consulting , a cost-report specialist in Lansing , Ill . " There is an incentive to abuse the system and wait for Medicare to catch you . And there has been no penalty for doing it . " <p> At bottom , Government cost reporting is supposed to follow a simple rule : Expenses must be related to patient care to be eligible for reimbursement . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  has to be picked up by the hospital alone . But different care-related costs receive different levels of reimbursement . <p> The result is that hospitals have an incentive to identify costs in ways that maximize reimbursement . For example , hospital care is reimbursed at a fixed rate , while outpatient treatment is repaid based on expenses . That creates incentives to load up costs on outpatient businesses . <p> Indeed , The Times reported in March that Medicare had paid far more for Columbia patients receiving outpatient services than if care had been billed at the state average . Government officials said such results could indicate inflated cost reporting . Investigators are also examining allegations that Columbia engaged in " upcoding "  --  reporting that a diagnosis was more severe than what was treated  --  and in potential billing fraud at hospital labs . <p> Today , the company says it is changing . But Columbia still faces investigators armed with mountains of its hospitals ' cost reports . Five years of those records fall within the statute of limitations for criminal prosecution . And in a related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dating back 10 years  --  right up to the day when Columbia was born . Reserve Records Hiding Real Figure , Reporting Another <p> In 1993 , when auditors from KPMG reviewed Kissimmee Memorial Hospital 's new cost report , a problem soon emerged : The hospital appeared to be lying . <p> The Columbia hospital in Kissimmee , Fla. , had classified $81,000 of interest expense as " old capital "  --  meaning it involved a project before 1990 . In truth , as KPMG discovered , more than one-third of the cost was for " new capital , " which is reimbursed at a lower rate . <p> In a letter , KPMG did not suggest correcting the number but instead effectively aided the hospital in its scheme . The firm advised Kissimmee to include the expenses in a reserve fund on the chance that Medicare would select the hospital as one of the few that receive an extensive audit each year . <p> " On the reserve cost report , " KPMG wrote of the expense , " we will reflect $33,054 as new capital costs as identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made the reserve records critical evidence in the Government investigation . Not only do they identify misreported items , but prosecutors could use them to try to prove an intent to defraud , a necessity in a criminal case . <p> George Ludwith , a spokesman for KPMG , declined to discuss details from the records . But he said the firm " is fully confident that the services it rendered to Columbia were appropriate and professional . " <p> The Times obtained 11 sets of reserve reports or related records involving hospitals in Florida , Texas , Georgia , Tennessee and Arkansas . Many were prepared when the hospitals were part of Columbia ; others by companies that Columbia later acquired . <p> Reserve reports are commonplace tools for financial management at many for-profit hospitals . Properly used , they identify costs that can reasonably be considered reimbursable under Medicare 's maze of regulations but that nevertheless might be disallowed . In other words , the reports , and the money they set aside , are supposed to be safety valves to account for potential differences of interpretation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solely that way . <p> For example , Doctors Regional Medical Center in Corpus Christi , Tex. , set up reserves for items that totaled less than $55,000 . The items  --  bad debts of Medicare patients and corporate overhead  --  are often revised by Medicare , making them appropriate inclusions in reserve funds , experts said . Horizon Medical Center of Dickson , Tenn. , was more aggressive but told Medicare of problems found by its accountants . <p> Other hospitals took greater liberties . Another Texas hospital , for example , failed to report its home-care agency 's square footage but included it in the reserve . Through a complex formula , that could increase reimbursement , experts said . In its filings , the same hospital did not remove overhead costs for its gift shop  --  which are not reimbursable because they are not patient related  --  but did so in its reserve report . <p> In one case , the papers show accountants recommending the shift of money held in reserve into profits . For example , records indicate that Trinity Hospital in Erin , Tenn. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Medicare never squawked , so last year the money moved to the bottom line . <p> " Nonallowable P.O.B. was not adjusted in the 10/31/93 and 10/31/94 audits , " an accountant wrote of the building . " So I propose we not reserve for this issue in the future . " <p> Columbia said that the amount of reimbursement involved in the Trinity issue was a modest $2,000 and that it believed nonreimbursable costs for the building were appropriately removed from the cost report . <p> At times , great effort was made to insure reserve records remained secret . Papers from 1990 for the Community Hospital of De Queen , in De Queen , Ark. , then owned by Healthtrust before being acquired by Columbia , were stamped " CONFIDENTIAL . Do not discuss or release to Medicare auditors . " <p> Of records reviewed by The Times , none included more questionable claims than those of Southwest , the hospital that inflated its property taxes . For years , Southwest , which worked with KPMG when the hospital was owned by Basic American and Columbia , claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1991 , KPMG identified about $483,000 in Southwest 's costs as unrelated to patient care . The accountants recommended that Southwest " offset " the expenses on its reserves , just to be safe . <p> " The as-filed cost report includes $186,765 of operating expenses generated by the non-patient related activities of the physician development office , " one typical entry reads . " We recommend that , for reserve purposes , these expenses be offset . " <p> Experts said this statement clearly suggested impropriety . " To say that it is not patient related says for sure it is not allowable , " said Mr. Plonsey , the cost-report specialist . " You ca n't put anything in the cost report that is not related to patient care . " <p> In the same year , Southwest filed items that had previously been disallowed , including $73,000 related to a cardiac-consulting business without alerting Medicare of what it was doing on the designated line of the report . <p> The next year , when Southwest was owned by Columbia , many of the same items and some new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicare auditors did an extensive review of Southwest 's 1991 expense claims . According to Southwest 's records , the auditors disallowed or scaled back many , but not all , of the improper claims , including property taxes , the cardiac consulting costs and more than $500,000 worth of other nonpatient costs . In a subsequent audit of the 1992 report , they disallowed many similar costs . <p> In all , the audits uncovered more than $1 million in misreported costs by Southwest . The hospital was forced to return that  --  but still came out a winner . It did not pay a penny in penalties or interest , in effect benefiting from an interest-free Government loan . Analyzing Cost Reports In Florida and Texas , A Warning Flag <p> Cost-reporting fraud is a matter of increments and slivers . Rarely is there a single , large transaction that accounts for the crime . Instead , it is found in a small , misreported expense here , an inflated cost there . <p> Last Jan. 10 , for example , a Columbia consultant reviewed the 1996 cost report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several claims seemed puzzling , particularly cafeteria and housekeeping costs reported for the hospital 's home-care agency . <p> The consultant questioned Tommy Stoves , a Columbia executive , about the expenses . According to a Government affidavit , Mr. Stoves replied that it was corporate policy for hospitals to shift costs onto their home-care facilities . Such accounting sleight of hand has the effect of illegally increasing Medicare reimbursement because home care is paid within limits based on its costs ; hospital care is not . <p> Unknown to Mr. Stoves , the consultant was a Government informant who reported the conversation to investigators . A Columbia spokesman said Mr. Stoves no longer worked for the company ; telephone calls to a number listed for him went unanswered . <p> But whether such small bits and pieces ultimately add up to a larger scheme also requires a look at overall cost patterns . The Times therefore analyzed data from all hospitals in Texas and Florida , which have been identified in court records as states where investigators think cost fraud took place . <p> Such an analysis has limitations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they occur . In other words , the analysis may be consistent with fraud but is not proof of it . <p> The Times examined overhead costs at 95 hospital-based home-care agencies and found a pattern similar to what the consultant described , with Columbia home-care agencies reporting overhead that was significantly higher than that of their competitors . <p> In Florida , about half of the expenses of the typical Columbia home-care agency were reported as administrative , compared with 31.8 percent at the typical non-Columbia agency . The biggest discrepancy in costs was not for services or salaries but rather in the grab-bag category of " other , " where it is easier to put unusual charges . At the typical Columbia hospital in Florida , " other " accounted for 15.4 percent of the total compared with 7.6 percent at the typical rival . <p> Columbia 's per-visit overhead costs were higher , too . In Florida , the typical Columbia hospital reported $25.82 of administrative costs for each visit , compared with $16.88 for the typical non-Columbia hospital . In Texas , the typical Columbia hospital spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw this data , this would make them a target for audit , " one expert , speaking on condition of anonymity , said when told of the data . " It sounds out of line . " <p> Mr. Campbell , the Columbia spokesman , stressed that home-care agencies had limits on the amount of costs that could be reimbursed . He added that the company believed such discrepancies could result from start-up costs and management fees associated with its rapid move into home care . Federal investigators are examining whether those fees were deliberately inflated to increase reimbursement . <p> The Times also examined a cost-report accounting category called " nonreimbursable cost centers . " Despite their name , such cost centers are only partly about direct costs that the Government is not supposed to pay for , such as the expense of running a gift shop . Through a complex formula , decreasing the amount in this category can increase the total hospital administrative expenses considered for reimbursement . <p> The Times analysis found costs reported at the typical Columbia hospital in Texas for such activities plummeted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs climbed by 38 percent . That meant a decrease of about $165,906 in this nonreimbursable category . <p> The contrast with other Texas hospitals was stark . The percentage of such nonreimbursable costs reported by the typical competitor stayed about even as total costs crept up slightly more than 1 percent . <p> A somewhat different picture emerged in Florida . While Columbia 's percentage decline in such costs was second to its for-profit competitors , it still surpassed not-for-profit and Government hospitals , which reported increases in such nonreimbursable costs . <p> Mr. Campbell said that Columbia believed that its hospitals engaged in fewer nonreimbursable activities than competing hospitals because many management services were handled in division offices . Geared for Abuse Unwieldy System Aids Misuse , Critics Say <p> Conflicting rules . Inadequate supervision . Long lags in final Government approval . Those factors , critics say , have combined to create an attitude that manipulating the system is just part of doing business . <p> " I do n't think you could make the cost-reporting system any worse than it is , " said William T. Cuppett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounting firm . " It breeds inefficiencies , and it is poorly and inconsistently administered across the country . " <p> To a large extent , cost reporting was a hospital industry invention . When faced with the prospect of Medicare in the 1960 's , the industry demanded cost-based reimbursement and won . But that system offered little incentive to hold down spending , and by the early 1980 's , Medicare faced financial crisis . In response , Congress abandoned cost-based reimbursement for inpatient care , adopting fixed rates for each illness . <p> But to encourage cheaper modes of treatment , the Government continued to pay for the full cost of outpatient care . <p> Despite the hundreds of billions of dollars in Federal expenditures involved , responsibility for policing the system is turned over to dozens of independent contractors . For field audits , those contractors mostly rely on recent college graduates . And the organizations interpret the rules their own way . <p> " A cost viewed as allowable in New York might not be viewed as allowable " in New Jersey , said Richard Dixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care . <p> Moreover , huge claims can sail through without the Government 's knowledge . For example , The Times last year asked Medicare officials about Columbia 's use of an accounting technique involving cost reports to obtain millions of Government dollars after hospital acquisitions . Columbia 's purchase of a Miami Beach hospital was structured so that the company paid no cash yet received $24.7 million from Medicare . <p> Medicare officials expressed skepticism about the information but investigated . They discovered that not only had Columbia used the technique , known as recapture , but so had other hospitals . In 1995 alone , dozens of hospitals had obtained more than $150 million using recapture , the agency found . <p> " Relative to this particular issue , " Bruce Vladeck , then the head of the Medicare agency , said in an interview last year , " we were behind the curve . " At Mr. Vladeck 's urging , laws that narrow the use of recapture have since been adopted . <p> Still , the cost system remains a sea of bureaucratic confusion for hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not reimbursable , but the cost of advertising its treatments can be . Such inconsistencies have created widespread cynicism . <p> Even when hospitals were caught with incorrect cost claims , they historically got off scot-free . But hospitals are not just beneficiaries of the system ; they can suffer from the disarray , too . The appeal process for a wrongly rejected expense claim takes at least five years . <p> That combination of factors , experts said , encouraged the types of cheating that emerge in the Columbia documents  --  behavior that only recently began carrying serious risk of prosecution . <p> " Medicare pays first and asks questions later , " said Steven Rodgers , a health-law analyst with CCH Inc. , a business-law publishing company . " Fraud is a natural result of the system itself . " <p> A. Each year , most hospitals file a Government form to claim partial reimbursement of expenses related to patient care . The form warns that it is a Federal crime to lie about those expenses . B. Some hospitals prepare reserve cost reports for themselves . Used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but might be challenged by the Government . Some Columbia hospitals included expenses that they knew to be unallowable . If the accounts escaped scrutiny , the reimbursements added to profits . C. In some cases , outside accountants knew that Columbia was deceiving the Government . But often , all they did , as in this Southwest Regional Medical Center document , was assign costs unrelated to patient care to reserve reports . D. Employees were told not to show the reserve documents to the Government . At the Community Hospital of De Queen , papers were labled : " CONFIDENTIAL . Do not discuss or release to Medicare auditors . " ( pg . D6 ) Charts : " That Much More ? " The Government is investigating whether Columbia hospitals increased Federal reimbursement by shifting administrative costs onto their home-care agencies .
