<p> You walk into the lobby at 1441 L St. NW and your mind registers marble  --  polished , severe . The lobby is empty but for a guard . The air is cold and silent . The muscular stone throws echoes from the footsteps of intruders . There are marble planters but they are empty  --  a plant would be too blandly biological . You tell yourself that this is your typical Washington power lobby , perhaps a bit unusually skewed toward the mineral world . <p> No one seems to be coming or going . Behind the guard desk is a room holding computers and closed-circuit TV screens . The sign-in sheet shows that as of 10:40 a.m. the building has had two visitors . <p> You sign your name , you state your affiliation and reason for being there , and the guard hands you a magnetic security card . You insert it into a slot in a metal device affixed to the guard desk . A green light flashes . <p> You have just deactivated the light beam that blocks the path to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes from one side of the lobby to the other . There is no way to get to the elevators  --  to go anywhere in the building  --  without crossing the beam of light , unless you know it is there and jump over it or slide under it . If you do n't deactivate it first , an alarm will sound , a harsh buzz , recriminating . <p> What exactly do they keep inside 1441 L St. that is so precious , so desperately in need of high-tech security ? Enriched uranium ? Federal promissory notes ? Smallpox virus ? <p> Numbers . <p> Very important numbers . Leading numbers . This is the place where they keep the Leading Economic Indicators . This is also the place where they calculate the rise and fall of the Gross Domestic Product . This is the Bureau of Economic Analysis  --  probably the most boring-sounding place on Earth with a security light beam in the lobby . <p> " We have some 7s we ca n't let people see . We also have some 4s , " says the man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moran . He is 50 years old and wears a sweater vest . He is not completely joking about the 7s and 4s . Anyone who could get hold of the GDP and the Leading Economic Indicators in advance could make boodles of money on Wall Street . The financial markets love to overreact to everything . Moran once told a Wall Street trader that he did n't see what the big fuss was over the numbers . The trader responded that he 'd give Moran $ 25,000 a month for the numbers . Moran does n't think the offer was serious but the point was certainly made . <p> In the mid-1980s , in the heyday of greed , a few bureau employees were careless , to put it nicely . One day on the subway , one mentioned the upcoming GDP figure to a friend who was thinking of buying a house . Another worker discussed information with someone in the financial markets . Both were reprimanded and have since departed . A third employee actually used the inside information to make a few wise investments . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crackdown . The most important step was limiting the number of people with access to the final numbers . Moreover , employees working on figures for the GDP are kept segregated throughout the month . Only on the final day , when the GDP growth rate is tabulated , are they permitted to be in the same room . And then they are literally locked in . The bureau calls this " the lockup . " They are imprisoned all day . A guard stands at the door . On the inside . <p> People can exit the lockup only in pairs , after signing out with the guard . They must stay together until they return to the lockup . <p> There are two lockups a month , for the GDP and the Leading Economic Indicators . Moran goes into the lockup only for the indicators . He enters the lockup at about 4 p.m. that day . He prepares a press release . <p> Economic Fact No. 1 : In addition to leading indicators there are also Coincident Economic Indicators and Lagging Economic Indicators . The general public never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is obsessed with indicators that lead , not those that coincide or lag . <p> Economic Fact No. 2 : The GDP theoretically measures total output of the economy , with the growth rate reported to the nearest tenth of 1 percent . In reality the figure is just a ballpark estimate . The decimal point is a joke . To measure the economy exactly you 'd have to go to every store , interview every hot dog vendor . <p> Economic Fact No. 3 : The bureau uses information that is , for the most part , available to anyone with time and money to do the research . There are precisely 11 Leading Economic Indicators , many of them easily monitored , such as stock prices , building permits , equipment orders and unemployment claims . But some of the indicators ( such as " consumer expectations " or " change in manufacturers ' unfilled orders for durable goods " ) are not easily obtained or calculated . As for the GDP , it uses a huge amount of data . Duplicating that estimate would be like duplicating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually be slightly different from the official government number  --  and it 's the government number that makes Wall Street jump . <p> At 5 p.m . Moran seals the press release in a manila envelope , then tapes the envelope heavily , redundantly . The director of the bureau signs her name across the tape so that if anyone tries to remove or tamper with the tape , her signature will be distorted . Moran then puts the sealed envelope into yet another envelope and seals that one with more tape . <p> Then he walks toward the White House . <p> From 1441 L St. his fastest route would be down 15th Street to I Street , then down Vermont Avenue , and then across Lafayette Square . But whether he actually takes that route is something he wo n't discuss . <p> " I probably should n't tell you that , " Moran says . <p> Let us assume that he takes a zigzag route , occasionally simulating a window shopper or ducking into a bookstore to " browse , " never walking too fast or too intently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye the startling fact that he is on a secret mission to deliver to the nation 's top economist the latest Leading , Coincident and Lagging Economic Indicators . <p> At the Old Executive Office Building his package will be X-rayed by a guard to make sure it does not contain a bomb . Then Moran will hand it to an assistant at the Council of Economic Advisers . The assistant will inspect the envelopes for signs of tampering . The numbers will then be turned over to the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , who in turn is permitted to give the numbers to the president . The president then gives the numbers to the First Lady , who uses them to turn $ 1,000 investments into ... NO ! Wait . That is just an irresponsible joke . <p> In fact the president , by law , is n't supposed to give the numbers to anyone , not even to the secretary of commerce or the secretary of the treasury . They are n't allowed to find out until the next morning , at 8:30 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Directive on Compilation and Release of Principal Federal Economic Indicators , published in the Federal Register , Vol. 46 , No. 9 , Jan. 14 , 1981 , essentially says that the president is supposed to hear the numbers and then wander around all night with an inscrutable expression . If you ever see videotape of Bill Clinton with a smirk , it could be simply that he knows GDP is up 4.3 percent and he ca n't wait to tell people . Though it is probably something else . <p> As soon as Moran delivers the package , he must hurry back to the bureau office on L Street and reenter the lockup . If he 's late , they will start looking for him . <p> The cloak-and-dagger stuff is not designed simply to keep someone from using the numbers for personal gain . There 's also a desire to keep the numbers free of tampering . The numbers are guarded not only from financial speculators but also from overzealous politicians . The bureau is part of the executive branch , but it does n't want to be thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political appointees . <p> Carol Carson , the director , says no administration official has tried for at least 30 years to influence the bureau 's statistics . In an article last year she noted that a commerce secretary once picked up a pen and jotted a minor editorial change on a bureau press release about new Gross National Product figures . The bureau 's director told the secretary , " You are right , you improved it . But that is none of your business . " <p> One day Larry Moran was walking across Lafayette Square with his secret package when he saw a TV reporter doing a stand-up with the White House as the backdrop . The reporter was talking dramatically about the state of the economy . Moran chuckled silently . If only he knew what I had , he thought . <p> A few years ago Moran wrote a novel in his spare time . It was about a plot by the Soviet Union to destabilize the U.S. economy . <p> " Part of it had to do with prior access to numbers , " Moran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by people you do n't know , of indecipherable vocation , of mysterious sorrows and triumphs . You pass a man in a sweater vest and perhaps for a moment wonder what he does and how he got there and whether his is a life that any reasonable person would want to lead . You wonder what he is thinking . <p> Or maybe you do n't notice him at all . <p> " I look very ordinary , " Larry Moran says . " Which I am . I 'm a very ordinary person . " <p> He 's just part of the crowd . Just a man with an envelope .
