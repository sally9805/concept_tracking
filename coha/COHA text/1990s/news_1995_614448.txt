<p> When Susan Weiner first ran for mayor here five years ago , at least one local was appalled that a New York Republican newcomer would have the gall to think she could just waltz in and take over this genteel old Southern city . <p> " I got an anonymous telephone call at 6:30 a.m. from an elderly female who asked , ' Are you a native of Savannah ? ' " Weiner said . " I told her , ' Not at 6:30 a.m. or any other time , ' and she said , ' Then how do you have the audacity to run for mayor ? ' and slammed the phone down . " <p> Since she 's been in office , Weiner said , the personal attacks - aside from those launched by her political opponents - have stopped . Now , she 's running for mayor again in Savannah 's Nov. 7 nonpartisan election and already has opposition , including a challenge by longtime former Mayor John Rousakis . <p> " I have heard people here refer to me as ' our Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Weiner , 49 , who has lived here for a decade . " My daughter and sister in New York even accuse me of having a Southern accent . Maybe I do , but I still do n't say ' y'all . ' I think it would sound phony . " <p> Weiner still sometimes startles out-of-towners who are not aware Savannah 's CEO is a woman . Recently , she got a reaction from about 2,000 conventioneers when she appeared for a welcoming speech . <p> " I was listed on the program simply as ' the mayor of Savannah , ' and when I walked on stage , there was a perceivable intake of breath , " she said . " I stepped up and whispered into the microphone , ' Oh , my God ! It 's a woman ! ' It really broke up the group . " <p> Stage presence comes naturally to Weiner , perhaps by virtue of her years as a public schoolteacher and a professional actress in upstate New York . <p> In recent months , her name has surfaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senator . A few weeks ago , participating in a panel discussion on American cities at the Taub Center for Human Research at New York University , she was lumped with other high-profile Republican female office-holders as a possible contender for even higher office . <p> " Interviewers from The New York Times and other publications asked me if I thought it was time for the Republicans to name a woman like me for the vice-presidential slot , " she said . " I told them I was very honored even to be mentioned , but that I hope the Republicans do n't make the same mistake the Democrats did and name a candidate just because she 's a woman . " <p> That is not to say she would n't consider such an offer , Weiner admitted . She 'd have to think long and hard before making such a commitment , she said . <p> " Right now , I 'm running for mayor . I 've given up a lot of financial security and a great deal of my personal life . If I were running statewide or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privacy , " she said . " Al and I moved here 10 years ago because we 'd fallen in love with this beautiful city and we intended to live here and die here . That plan has n't changed . " <p> Susan Weiner and her husband , Albert B. Weiner , discovered Savannah by accident 13 years ago when they traveled south during Easter break to escape a cold New York spring . <p> " My husband threw me , the toothbrush and the dog in the car and said we were heading someplace warm , " Weiner recalled . " After driving for hours on Interstate 95 , he asked when we were getting off this thing . I told him to hang a right at the first palm tree . It happened to be the exit leading to Savannah . " <p> They were captivated by Savannah 's sultry beauty , its picturesque old buildings and its green canopy of live oaks and flower-filled public squares . Three years later , when Al Weiner retired from his job as a college drama professor , the two packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to run for public office at the time . <p> " I shared the impression that most non-Southerners have of the South : that people here live behind the moss veil and if you were n't born here , you 'll never be completely accepted . " <p> When she could n't find a job , Weiner - the mother of three grown children - plunged into politics as a volunteer , working for George Bush , among others . She quickly made a name for herself among Savannah 's growing Republican community as a tireless , articulate woman with enough chutzpah to challenge the political status quo . <p> Weiner 's 1991 win over Rousakis was stunning , especially in a city with a majority black population and liberal whites who live in Savannah 's ethnically diverse downtown historic district . <p> Rousakis , a charismatic Democrat who held the mayor 's chair for 21 years , claims Weiner 's election was a fluke , aided by his own failure to campaign hard enough . <p> " I underplayed the general election because I thought the win would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent interview . <p> He also inflamed some constituents before that election by joking to a gathering of supporters that a woman knew she 'd been assaulted by a Democrat because " she knew she never had it so good . " <p> The former mayor , who has run his insurance business since his defeat , said his years in office made him an easy target to blame for any of the city 's ills , including a skyrocketing murder rate . <p> " The Jivens gang could have cost me the election , " he said , referring to a band of teenage cocaine dealers who committed as many as 20 murders to prove loyalty to their youthful leader , Ricky Jivens . A few months after the election , the city 's murder rate dropped significantly when Jivens was captured and his gang broken up . Jivens is now serving a life-without-parole sentence in federal prison . <p> Weiner agreed the Jivens gang skewed Savannah 's murder statistics . But , she claims , the city 's murder rate has stayed down because of anti- crime efforts initiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to implement community-oriented policing , which is the old cop-on-the-beat philosophy of police officers who park , walk and talk to people in the neighborhoods , " she said . " We 've also created a countywide counternarcotics team at the request of the Chamber of Commerce , the business community and the manufacturing council . " <p> Sheila Morley , former president and a board member of the Citizens Crime Commission , said Weiner rightfully deserves credit for her anti- crime efforts . <p> " No one person is responsible for the overall decline in crime in Savannah , but she has been instrumental in getting a variety of programs going , " Morley said . " The former administration just sat on its rear end and never did anything . " <p> On the down side , Morley said Weiner has not been accessible enough to talk to representatives of the crime commission , which boasts almost 3,000 members in the Savannah-Chatham County area . <p> " That 's my major criticism of her , " Morley said . " She 's been very busy , and it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Weiner is likely to be at her most accessible this summer as she campaigns for re-election . For the first time , Savannah will hold a nonpartisan mayoral contest , eliminating primaries . <p> Rousakis has already announced his intention to try to win back his old office . Weiner is also being challenged by Alderman Floyd Adams , Jr. , one of her fiercest critics on the City Council , and Frances Wright Johnson , an outspoken advocate for city employees and members of Savannah labor unions . Both Adams and Johnson are black , as is 53 percent of the city 's population . <p> Weiner claims to have widespread support in Savannah 's black community as well as among its business leaders . <p> " Last time , I polled 38 percent of the black vote , " she said . " And Savannah is like the rest of Georgia - very conservative - so the business community will be supporting me this election because business is up . At the same time , the environmentalists know I do n't support business at the expense of neighborhoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud . " <p> Conceding she has formidable business support , Rousakis said he believes Weiner 's popularity has waned . <p> " I 'm concerned about the leadership void emanating from City Hall , " he said . " The mayor has had problems working with her own City Council . She 's exercised the awesome power of the mayoral veto three times , something I never did during all my years in office . " <p> Weiner admitted she had problems winning council support at first . <p> " I had to learn that government is slow and you have to take time to build consensus , " she said . " I 've also learned that there are some elected officials who would rather keep their constituents in pain than cooperate . That 's the lesson that shocked me the most . " <p> Now , Weiner said , she and the eight aldermen work more effectively toward common goals . <p> In addition to an overall decline in Savannah 's crime rate , Weiner cited a rise in business activity , with a net of 14 new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . She said tourism is up about 10 percent . Her plan to privatize the revitalization of Broughton Street , a major downtown thoroughfare that had fallen on hard times , is working , she said . <p> Weiner also claims credit for garnering millions in state and federal funds toward a variety of city projects , including grants for improving Martin Luther King Jr . Boulevard and building a 1,000-foot extension of the Riverwalk to the Savannah Marriott Riverfront , which will serve as the coastal Olympic Village . Savannah is to host Olympic yachting during the 1996 Games . <p> She successfully lobbied for federal disaster relief to buy out and relocate residents of low-lying neighborhoods that repeatedly flooded . <p> " The city asked for a lot more than the $ 9 million we got , but no government alone can fix this problem . So , we 're putting together a program involving community support in the form of volunteers and contributions and help from Habitat for Humanity . " <p> Probably the single most controversial issue during Weiner 's administration has been her outspoken husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Rousakis on election night , Al Weiner called the former mayor a pig . Later , upset over opposition to his wife on the City Council , Al Weiner impugned the intelligence of four unnamed aldermen , prompting the four black council members to brand him a racist and demand an apology . He no longer regularly attends council meetings . <p> Susan Weiner said she , not her husband , is Savannah 's mayor . <p> " My husband is always involved in my political decisions , " she said . " But my husband is not involved in my government decisions . " <p> Now , Weiner said she is eager to tackle another four years . After the long Rousakis reign , the city limited any mayor from serving more than two consecutive terms . <p> Weiner said she is comfortable now in her mayoral role and believes she has important contributions to make to her adopted city . Come November , she predicts , Savannah voters will agree . <p> " People have realized it is n't important that I 'm a female Republican outsider , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real , substantive alternative to what I called ' the boys downtown .
