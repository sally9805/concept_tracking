<p> In one of The Godfather Part III 's most memorable scenes , Michael Corleone , sucked back into the Mafia 's bloody ways , bemoans his fate : " Just when I thought I was out , they pull me back in . " <p> It 's likely no one knows how he feels better than the movie 's mastermind , Francis Ford Coppola . For 16 years , the director refused pleas from three regimes of executives at Paramount Pictures to make another Godfather . <p> But on Christmas Day , the third installment of the saga he 's always bound to be associated with will be unveiled in 1,800 theaters nationwide . <p> Though proud of his creation , Coppola calls the film " a floating crap game of a movie " because of its high stakes and problems that forced him to constantly rewrite scenes . <p> Paramount has spent $ 55 million just to make the movie . And rarely has a film opened to higher expectations and awareness . Nine out of every 10 moviegoers are aware of Godfather III , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Godfather , released in 1972 , and its 1974 sequel have totaled more than $ 800 million in revenues worldwide . Together they also won nine Academy Awards , including two best picture Oscars . <p> Still , a box-office bonanza is n't a sure thing . The biggest challenge is bridging the generation gap , says Barry London , co-president of Paramount 's Motion Picture Group . Many moviegoers were just learning to walk the last time the Corleones convened . <p> Early reviews are mostly encouraging . Time says Godfather III is " a meandering but finally quite affecting climax to the saga . " Variety writes , " Coppola has come close to succeeding completely with The Godfather Part III . " <p> Set in 1979 , the movie centers on an aging Michael Corleone 's ( Al Pacino ) lust for respectability and his inevitable fall back into bloody corruption . Andy Garcia co-stars as Vincent , the hot-tempered illegitimate son of Michael 's late brother Sonny who 's poised to become his successor as Mafia don . Sister Connie ( Talia Shire ) has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Diane Keaton ) , is remarried . Daughter Mary ( Coppola 's daughter Sofia ) has the hots for her cousin Vincent , while son Anthony 's ( Franc D'Ambrosio ) passion is for the opera . <p> For the new roles , Coppola auditioned every young actor who was interested , and each role 's importance to the plot kept changing depending on whom was being considered . <p> " We constantly did n't know how it was going to work out , " he says . " Matt Dillon did a beautiful job ( as Vincent ) . Val Kilmer was terrific . For a while I thought of having De Niro as Vincent , making him a guy who 'd gone to prison . If De Niro was Vincent then Madonna , who did a screen test , would have worked as an older , tougher cousin . But then everyone else would have had to be so much older . " <p> So many auditioned for the movie that Joe Mantegna learned he 'd been cast from the owner of his neighborhood pizza parlor , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I only knew I was being considered , " recalls Mantegna , who co-stars as Joey Zasa , a pivotal flashy don . " He said he was in the casting office and saw 8-by-10s ( photographs ) on the wall of everybody in the movie and the name Joey Zasa under my picture . I froze in my tracks . " <p> Coppola resisted making another Godfather because , he says , " I did n't know where to go . I thought I 'd finished things with Godfather II . " <p> Several attempts to develop the film without him were made involving stars from Sylvester Stallone to John Travolta . <p> Then in 1989 , distance from the saga coupled with financial woes caused Coppola change his mind . <p> " I needed the money , " he says . " I had a very tough 10 years . I wanted some security and breathing room . " <p> A slew of pricey box-office disappointments , such as One From the Heart , The Cotton Club and Tucker : The Man and His Dream , had forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Coppola reportedly received $ 4 million to $ 6 million to direct , produce and co-write Godfather III and stands to make millions more from a share of box-office receipts if it 's a hit . <p> He was under the gun for time from the start . Coppola , who wanted to spend eight months fleshing out the script , says , " we suggested it for a year later telling them ( Paramount ) that we could make it cheaper and have a better script . But they wanted it now . " <p> He and Mario Puzo , writer of The Godfather best seller , wrote a script in about eight weeks . But it was constantly revised during production . <p> " No one knew if they were going to be killed or let to live , " says Don Novello , who plays a press agent . " We started production without a real ending . " <p> The biggest rewriting was forced when Robert Duvall rejected Paramount 's $ 1.5 million offer to reprise his role of the family consigliere . ( Pacino was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> His role had been " written like he was a brother to Michael , " Coppola says . <p> More revisions were forced when Winona Ryder , cast as Mary , dropped out because of illness the day before she was to shoot her first scene . <p> Coppola stirred controversy by recasting the role with his daughter , Sofia , whose only acting experience had been tiny parts in her father 's films . Most notably , she played Michael 's infant godson in The Godfather 's baptism scene . <p> " She really helped me out , " Coppola says . " Part of the reason I always loved Winona is that she reminded me of my own daughter . " <p> Shire , Coppola 's sister , says , " at the time , I said it was too much to ask for her . I saw a lovely quality in her but I was terribly concerned that it was too much . But far too much has been made out of this , " she adds , referring to countless reports of Sofia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act , not just because of the rewrites but also because both Mantegna and Shire were simultaneously making other films . <p> " It was wild . I never knew who I was , " says Shire , who on several occasions had to jet from the Godfather III set in Rome to Philadelphia , where Rocky V was shooting . <p> Through it all , Coppola says , the budget was his largest concern . " Keeping it down is where I put most of my creative energy , " he says . " I 'm aware that people think of me as not a practical person . But that 's only because I 'm best known for my movies that went over budget . ... Still I did n't want to read what a jerk I was in the papers . " <p> The budget ran over about $ 10 million , which both Coppola and Paramount mostly attribute to the movie 's tight timetable . <p> Originally slated to open at Thanksgiving , the movie almost was n't finished in time for Tuesday 's opening . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that I 've been tinkering , " Coppola says . " That 's not it at all . This is a big film . I 've just had a minimal amount of time . " <p> He and editors worked around the clock to meet the deadline . " We did four months of work in three weeks . It 's not the best way to finish a film but its an old show-biz tradition .
