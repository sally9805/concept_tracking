For months the fragile Likud-Labor coalition has been heading for a showdown over how Israel should engage the Palestinians . Last week Likud Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir nearly precipitated the crisis by announcing that he was firing Science and Technology Minister Ezer Weizman for holding secret talks with the P.L.O . Israeli policy forbids contact with the P.L.O. , but Weizman has long advocated  --  and indirectly practiced  --  a dialogue . Labor threatened to bolt from the government , but eventually both sides compromised .
