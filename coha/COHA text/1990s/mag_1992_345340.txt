If misery loves company , a lot of recession-battered Americans may be gazing across the sea . There is certainly fuel for economic schadenfreude  --  the sneaky feeling of glee at your neighbor 's troubles  --  over there . Europe has fallen into a slump since the middle of last year , and unemployment and stagnation are becoming political problems as well . The American tourists who have seen how well Europeans live may find it difficult to believe , but hard times there are a fact . <P> Anyone who draws satisfaction from this state of affairs is making a serious mistake . The world economy is too closely intertwined for any country 's hardships to be anything but bad news for everyone . With so many nations relying on export sales , simultaneous recessions could pull the whole trading system down . <P> Just a few months ago , Germany seemed to be chugging along in its now- traditional role as the Continent 's locomotive , pulling the European Community toward ever higher performance . But now the " Deutschland Express " has stalled and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " We are in a recession , " Norbert Walter , chief economist of the Deutsche Bank , says flatly , which means this will be " a year of recession in Europe . " Other German experts , who shudder at the very word recession , say it has not arrived yet  --  but is just around the corner . The country can console itself with the knowledge that its problems arise largely from its reabsorption of the former East Germany , where many of the old centrally directed enterprises stand idle and official unemployment nears 12%  --  not counting another 2 million workers in part-time , make-work jobs . Few Germans seem steeped in the gloom that prevails elsewhere : the economic and social costs of unification will be paid off in due course , and opinion polls indicate most citizens think that will be soon . <P> In recent years , unemployment in the larger European countries has been considerably higher than in the U.S. That is still the case in Britain , Italy and France , where the percentage of jobless is well above the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hit even harder : 19% are out of work in Ireland , 15% in Spain and 11% in Belgium . Such high rates would produce a political earthquake in the U.S. , but Europeans are better cushioned by more generous unemployment benefits . <P> Britain 's stubborn recession was induced in part by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 's tax cuts of 1987 , the ensuing rise in inflation to 11% and the stiff interest-rate hikes Thatcher then used to force prices down . Those rates are still high , and real estate and industry have not recovered from the whipsaw . For the new government of John Major , improvement can not come too soon : he must call national elections by June . <P> Europeans generally deny that , as the old saw has it , their economies develop pneumonia whenever America sneezes . Still , political leaders are quick to point a finger abroad when it suits them . Just as some American politicians blame Japan for the recession , the U.S. is a popular whipping boy in Europe . French President Francois Mitterrand finds his popularity plunging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he claimed the country had been growing until " suddenly the bad news arrived , mostly from the U.S. "
