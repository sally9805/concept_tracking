<p> FOR environmental planners , the watchwords for the 1990s are think globally , act locally . <p> Major environmental challenges - stratospheric ozone depletion , climate change , a possible decline in the ability of the atmosphere to clean itself - are global in scope . Yet the human activity that causes them is regional and local . It must be dealt with at national levels . <p> Hitting this theme in a scientific review paper in the American Chemical Society journal Environmental Science &; Technology , Victor Phillips of the Hawaii National Energy Institute explains that the solutions to these challenges " will have many facets depending on local ecosystems , culture , and political economy , but will have in common a fundamental change in how we humans perceive nature . " <p> The report on climatic warming released earlier this month by the Committee on Science , Engineering , and Public Policy of the National Academies of Science and Engineering and Institute of Medicine in Washington makes the same point . It concludes that " even given the considerable uncertainties in our knowledge ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responses . " Yet , it adds that the study " does not attempt to view greenhouse warming from the perspective of a country less well-endowed " than the US . <p> For example , the world recognizes that carbon dioxide released by burning fossil fuels is one of the main heat-trapping gases driving the climate system toward global warming . <p> Yet , as Toufig Siddiqi of the East-West Center in Honolulu points out , a global agreement to reduce the release of greenhouse gases would have to allow for increased carbon dioxide emissions from developing nations for at least two decades . He bases his conclusions on a study by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . He explains that " developing countries that rely mainly on domestic sources of energy , usually coal , are not in a financial position to switch to cleaner imported fuels . " <p> This theme of global thinking with local action is a recognition that the world faces common and unprecedented environmental challenges even though nations must respond in individually appropriate ways . For environmental scientists , the effort to build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task of this decade . <p> The academy greenhouse warming report reflects the consensus of climate scientists when it notes that the computer models ( programs ) that predict climate change have serious flaws . They ca n't take adequate account of the oceans , for example . <p> In March , Jane Robinson and colleagues at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory in England reported in Nature , that oceanographers do n't even understand how oceans absorb carbon dioxide as well as they thought they did . She called it " premature " to use computer models to simulate what happens to atmospheric carbon dioxide . <p> The Earth Observing System - an international program of Canada , the European Space Agency , Japan , and the United States - will help fill knowledge gaps . <p> This " mission to planet Earth " as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) calls its share of the program , will monitor our environment from space . NASA plans to have a large Earth-scanning platform on orbit around 1998 . Although managed by Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Calif. , will supply major instruments . <p> JPL director Edward Stone calls this " a very important " research area for the laboratory that has won fame with its missions to other planets . He points out that water vapor is the most important heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere . Yet it is one on which there is relatively little data to feed into computer climate simulations . " It 's difficult to know what the hydrological cycle is over the Earth as a whole when most of the atmosphere is over the oceans , " Dr. Stone says . <p> A JPL-supplied spectrometer on the orbiting platform that will measure infrared radiation at various wavelengths will trace water vapor through the atmosphere . Another instrument that detects how waves scatter radar energy will track surface winds over the sea . From these wind data , Stone says , analysts can derive evaporation over the world ocean . <p> The lower atmosphere also needs comprehensive scrutiny . Reviewing this need in Environmental Science &; Engineering , Jack Fishman of the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton , Va. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dramatically altered if the composition of the ( lower atmosphere ) changes significantly . " <p> This " self-cleansing ability " is represented by what chemists call the hydroxyl radical . It is an electrically charged combination of an oxygen atom and a hydrogen atom . This highly reactive naturally occurring chemical cleans out many pollutants . However , some atmospheric chemists have suggested that hydroxyl depletion may be on the rise , although the evidence is not clear . <p> Last December , for example , James Kao and Xuexi Tie at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico reported a study that suggests the Northern Hemisphere has only about 25 percent as much hydroxyl as does the Southern Hemisphere . They said the heavier industrial pollution in the Northern Hemisphere might be responsible . <p> However , a similar study by Clarisa Spivakovsky of Harvard University reported in the Journal of Geophysical Research last October did not find severe hydroxyl loss in the Northern Hemisphere . <p> But gaining more physical data alone wo n't build a solid knowledge base . Scientists also need to know much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaining that knowledge is the job of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program ( IGBP ) of the International Council of Scientific Unions . <p> Already five years in planning , the program is ready for takeoff . Reviewing that planning in Environmental Science &; Technology , Thomas Rosswell , executive director of the program 's secretariat , says , " Within the decade of the 1990s , the IGBP will launch a worldwide research effort , unprecedented in its comprehensive interdisciplinary scope . " <p> The global scrutiny now gathering momentum will involve many programs on land and at sea . However , looking at the overall challenge , JPL 's Mr. Stone , who has helped explore most of the solar system , sees a special role for spacecraft . " There 's a very nice linkage in terms of technology and basic scientific disciplines in looking at the Earth as a planet , " he says .
