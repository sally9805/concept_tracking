In its prime , back in the late 1950s and ' 60s , Gucci defined chic . It was one of the great names in fashion , a symbol of luxury , elegance and quality . By the 1980s , however , the label had become tattered and worn , a victim of sloppy manufacturing , countless knockoffs and feuds among members of the Gucci clan . Stylish women chose Chanel suits and Fendi handbags . But Gucci ? Never . <P> Now , from Bologna to Beverly Hills , the fashion faithful are once again flocking to buy Gucci  --  but it is Gucci with a modern twist . In addition to the subdued browns and blacks that were once Gucci 's trademark , the new line of leather goods boasts a rainbow palette of splashy colors . Traditional suede moccasins ( $265 ) come in a dozen offbeat shades , from bubble-gum pink to purple to bright orange . A new line of $500 knapsacks , aimed at a younger and hipper clientele , ranges from scarlet suede to bronze satin . And Gucci 's spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that are perfect for the trendiest of late-night soirees . The satin , kidskin and suede bags will be offered in deep purple and fire-engine red , as well as navy blue and basic black . <P> Gucci 's new look is very much the vision of Dawn Mello , 52 , who signed on as creative director last year . Formerly the president of New York City 's upscale Bergdorf Goodman department store , the tall and elegant Mello set out to rebuild the image of the 68-year-old company by drawing on its successful past . " Gucci should be classic , but with an edge , " she says . " It should not be boring . " <P> Hence , Mello 's concept of a Gucci for the ' 90s takes many cues from bygone decades . A $565 hobo bag , which had not been manufactured since 1975 , has been revived and is now one of the two top Gucci offerings in U.S. stores . The other is a roomy , bamboo-handle leather bag , created in 1957 . The updated version , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered in calfskin leather ( $895 ) and crocodile ( $8,000 ) . <P> Mello finds inspiration in unlikely places . While she was eating dinner one night in a Florence restaurant , a man Mello had never met before showed her a worn-out pigskin Gucci briefcase that he had held on to for 25 years . Gucci no longer sold the case , he told her . Would they consider bringing it back ? Mello admired the case , and Gucci will soon manufacture it . " We 'd always been known for our briefcases , " says Mello . " We want to have that name again . " <P> Gucci 's image make-over comes as part of an overhaul of the entire Gucci organization . The revival is spearheaded by Maurizio Gucci , 42 , the founder 's grandson , who last year assumed control of Guccio Gucci S.p.A . With the support of Investcorp , a Bahrain-based investment firm that owns half the business , Gucci pared the product line from 22,000 to 7,000 items , and he will probably trim the inventory still further .
