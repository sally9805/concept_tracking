Jeffrey Bilhuber explains how the Carlyle hotel , Giacometti and a Lucite chair turned a boy from Long Island into one of New York 's premier interior designers . Photograph // When I was 10 years old , I found a stash of Architectural Digests at a neighbor 's house . The experience transformed me . Forget National Geographic with its naked aborigine women ; I spent hours in the bathroom lusting through those design magazines . " What a pair of chairs she has ! " I exclaimed . " People actually live like that ? " Until then I thought having Styrofoam beams in the den was living large . The experience , I would later realize , set me on the path I now so gloriously follow . Growing up in Huntington , NY , I did n't know there were such things as decorators . Well , I suppose I did , but I certainly did n't know any . I only saw a few melancholy women doing that sort of thing . You know the saying , " If you 're a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , if I was n't happily married , did that make me a decorator , or a woman ? In need of some vehicle for my nascent creativity , I enrolled at Cornell 's School of Hotel Administration , and after graduation I began working as a cashier at the Carlyle hotel in Manhattan . My timing was fortuitous ; they had just begun an internal renovation and hired three decorators as outside consultants . Eventually , I became project administrator and realized in the process that there were amazing people working in this field who were not only enlightened but rewarded for their talents . Mark Hampton was there , doing some of the rooms . He was dapper , creative and successful . Hubert de Givenchy was living in the hotel at the time . Until that point , I had done everything in my power to avoid being artistic because I thought it could be neither lucrative nor admirable , but these people were doing quite well . Soon enough , I began seeing things very differently . But I still worked some shifts as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me : " Watt arrr you doing back zere behind zose bars ? You should be out here . Free yourself . " He was right . Two days later I called in sick . That 's when the light went on ... or , in my case , the chandelier . I went to my boss and proclaimed , " I have to leave , it 's a matter of salvation ... l was born to be a decorator ! " &gt; One of my earliest jobs was , in fact , for Givenchy , who was in a building on Madison Avenue . He wanted me to design the top-floor atelier . With incredible speed and an unwavering eye , he selected a perfect combination of fabrics and finishes from the thousands I presented to him . His inspiration for the space was a simple bird 's nest . Genius ! Of course , this one came complete with a Diego Giacometti bird . If that 's a bird 's nest , I 'll start laying eggs now ! Givenchy was a pleasure to work withan enlightened and elegant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listen , interior design is no picnic either . Actually , for many , a great decorator is all about lunch . That 's it-lunch . Grab a few drinks with clients , take them shopping , and they 'll buy anything . How awful is that ? Make a couple of " 40-proof sales , " then take the rest of the week off . You know , chardonnay , gone tomorrow . Thankfully , I learned differently , being exposed to people who made creativity a business , who had the luxury of refusal , who sought simplicity . To do that , when I started , was unknown ; in the high ' ' 80s , you could n't mount Ormolu on top of Ormolu fast enough ! They were n't just gilding the lily . They were gilding the rose , the daisy and the dandelion , too . Along comes Givenchy , asking that we use linen , cotton , straw and plaster . That 's a vision of clarity that transforms .

I 'd never seen anything like his house before . Designed by Paul Rudolph , one of America 's great modernist architects , it was elegantly spare . Slate , flannel , charcoal wool , with a glint of Lucite and the luster of a bronze Noguchi sculpture . Huge volumes of space unadorned . Masses of ravishing orchids and dozens of glistening candles . You wanted to go home and burn what little you had . Just snap the legs off your one hideous chair to sit closer to the ground , paint everything white and upholster your headboard in yesterday 's suit . While I stood there gasping , he said he had a present for me . Up he went on those free-floating stairs-no handrail , just Ibeams stuck in the wall . He came down balancing a Lucite Laverne chair on his head . " Congratulations , " he said , " this is my housewarming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only if you take it home tonight . " I took it , then and there . Of course I was bombed . I mean it was a Halston party in the ' ' 80s . So at two o'clock in the morning , in the middle of a blizzard , I staggered up Park Avenue , dragging a chair . Taxi ? I do n't think so ! I wore it as a helmet and trudged onward . Halston passed on his first apartment , with its mirrorpaved walls , to the jewelry designer Elsa Peretti . When she hired me , Elsa wanted the mirrors out . I insisted she was mad to lose them . " Yes , yes , you are right , " she finally conceded , " but I feel fat . O Dios mio , what to do ? " Of course , she came up with the simplest solution . " Bah , we will paint all the mirrored walls white . When I lose 15 pounds , we will scrape the paint off ! " Perfection ! Elsa had lots of Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect America . " I want it to look American , I adore America , it has been so good to me , " she said . " Please , all of this fucking Chinese furniture is so foreign looking . We must do something . " I suggested indigo-blue denim , with Chinese-red saddle stitching . We did her entire apartment around the quintessential American icon , jeans . It was a marriage of Eastern and Western clarity that she understood perfectly because she has always thought on a pure scale . Before Elsa , everyone was wearing enormous jewelry- exploding pins and bowling ball-size stones . Not anymore . Before Iman and David Bowie hired me to do their Los Angeles apartment , they invited me to join them for a summer vacation on a boat in the South of France . We had a wonderful time , discussing art , sightseeing , exercising . After I 'd returned , I got a call from Iman , who was standing in an airport , reading the National Enquirer ( an airport , really , is the only place you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 've ruined my marriage ! " she said , laughing . They 'd run a story called BOWIE 's BRIDE-TO-BE CAUGHT IN THE ARMS OF A BLOND HUNK alongside these grainy pictures of Iman and me working out on deck . Well , of course David had been on board , and we were nowhere near Jamaica-as they 'd reported-and unfortunately my classification as a hunk could be questioned . ( Remember , I was still trying to figure out if I was a decorator or a woman . ) But there must be a lesson in there somewhere . So for all of you budding decorators out there , my lessons : 1 . DO N'T design for any other time or place . I mean , people do n't really want to live in 18th-century France or 19th-century Russia . If you want English country , move to England ! 2 . DO N'T believe that the customer is always right , no matter what they say . Wrong , wrong , wrong ! If your decorator gives you exactly what you want , fire him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative resolutions of a client 's goals . 3 . DO exercise the " luxury of refusal , " especially if a world-famous fashion designer gifts you with a Lucite chair at 2:00 A.M. 4 . DO N'T forget , the simplest answer is always the best solution . Less is more , but never minimal . 5 . DO N'T do resistance exercises with a supermodel on board a yacht in the South of France , even if her rock-star husband is with you . The paparazzi might be watching . <p>
