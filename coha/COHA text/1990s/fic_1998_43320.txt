Henry Goes to Dr. McAllister for Help and Benny Meets a Strange Visitor <p> WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE Jess , Henry , Violet , and Benny Alden , four orphaned children , run away , thinking that their grandfather is coming to claim them . Although they have never seen him , they believe him to be a cruel man . During a storm , they take shelter in an old railroad boxcar that they find stranded in the woods , and decide to live there . They furnish it with a few odds and ends that they find in a dump heap . Henry finds a job in a nearby town helping young Dr. McAllister and his mother , and returns each night to the boxcar home with food and other supplies . The doctor becomes very curious when Henry brings his little brother and two sisters along with him one day to help with the cherry picking . That night , Dr. McAllister is surprised to find an advertisement in the paper , offering a reward of $5 , 000 for information concerning four lost children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the man who is offering the reward . Later Henry attends Field Day in the nearby town of Intervale , and enters the free-for-all-race . When he wins , he receives a loving cup and the twenty-five-dollar prize from the hands of Mr. JH . Alden , one of the wealthy men who sponsor the meet . When asked for his name , the boy gives his first and middle names only , not daring to give his last one . " Henry James , " he replies . Part VI What Dr. McAllister ever did before Henry began to work for him would be hard to guess . There were certainly as many duties always waiting for him as he had time to do . And it made no difference to the industrious boy what the job was . Nothing was too hard or too dirty for him to attempt . One day the doctor set him at the task of cleaning out his little laboratory . The boy washed bottles , pasted labels , and cleaned instruments for one whole morning . And more than one broken flask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the hill to the hidden family . While Henry was busy carefully lettering a sticky label , he noticed a young man in the outer office who was talking with the doctor . " Can you tell me if this is real ginseng ? " Henry heard him say . " It certainly is , " returned Dr. McAllister . " They will give you two dollars a pound for the root at any of the drugstores . " Henry ventured to steal a peep , and found he could readily see the plant the man was holding . It was about a foot high with branching leaves and a fine feathery white flower . Henry knew it was the same kind of white puffball that he had noticed in Violet 's vase that very morning . When the young man had gone , Henry said , " I know where I can find a whole lot of that plant . " " Is that so ? " replied the doctor kindly . " It 's only the root , you know , that is valuable . But any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any quantity of that . " When Henry went home at noon he related enough of this incident to set his sisters to work in good earnest . They started out with both knives and two strong iron spoons , and the kettle . And with Benny to run about finding every white flower he could , the girls succeeded , with a great deal of hard digging , in finding enormous quantities of ginseng root . In fact , that first afternoon 's work resulted in a kettle full , not counting a single leaf or stem . Henry was delighted when he saw the result of their work , and took it next day to the largest drugstore , where he received three dollars for the roots . Without any hesitation Henry paid a visit to the dry-goods store , and came home with a pair of new brown stockings for Benny . That was a great day in the woods . Benny gave them no peace at all until they had admired his wonderful new stockings . There had been one other thing that Benny had given them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had crept so quietly away from the baker 's wife , Jess had forgotten to take Benny 's bear . This bear was a poor-looking creature , which had once been an expensive , bright  --  eyed teddy bear made of brown plush . But Benny had taken it to bed every single night for three years , and had loved it by day . It was not attractive to anyone but himself , for both eyes were gone , and its body was very limp . But Benny had certainly suffered a great deal trying to sleep in a strange bed without his beloved bear . Jess , therefore , had plans afoot , the moment she saw Benny 's new stockings . She washed the old brown stockings with their many neat darns , and hung them up to dry . And early in the afternoon , she and Violet sat with the work bag between them , each with a stocking . With Benny sitting by to watch the proceedings , Jess mapped out a remarkable teddy bear . One stocking , carefully trimmed , made the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , two legs , and the stuffing . Jess worked hard over the head , pushing the padding well into the blunt nose . Violet embroidered two beautiful eyes in black and white , and a jet black nose-tip . " You must make a tail , too , Jess , " said Benny , watching her snip the brown rags . " Bears do n't have tails , Benny , " argued Jess  --  although she was n't exactly sure she was right . " Your old bear did n't have any tail , you know . " " But this bear has a tail , " Benny replied , knowing that Jess would put on two tails if he insisted . And it was true . His bear finally did have a tail . " What kind of tail ? " asked Jess helplessly at last . " Bushy , long and slim , or cottontail ? " " Long and slim , " decided Benny with great satisfaction , " so I can pull it . " " Benny ! " cried Jess , laughing in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slim , exactly as Benny ordered , and sewed it on very tightly , so that it might be " pulled " if desired . She fastened on the legs and arms with flat hinges , so the bear might sit down easily , and added at last a pair of cunning floppy ears and a collar of braided red string from a bundle . Photograph <p> " What 's his name , Jess ? " asked Benny , when the wonderful bear was finally handed over to him . " His name ? " repeated Jess . " Well , you know , he 's a new bear . He is n't your old one , so I would n't call him Teddy . " " Oh , no , " said Benny , shocked . " This is not Teddy . This bear has a pretty tail . " " Of course , " agreed Jess , trying not to laugh . " Well , you know we sold that ginseng to pay for your new stockings . And if you had n't had your new ones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old ones . " " You want his name to be Stockings ? " asked Benny politely . " Stockings ? No , " answered Jess . " I was thinking of Ginseng . " " Ginseng ? " echoed Benny , thinking deeply . " That 's a nice name . All right , I think Ginseng will be a good bear , if Watchie does n't bark at him . " And from that moment , the bear 's name was Ginseng as long as he lived , and he lived to be a very old bear indeed . The days went merrily by for the boxcar family . Hardly a day passed , however , without some exciting adventure . Mrs. McAllister , finding out in some way that Violet was a clever seamstress , sent home fine linen handkerchiefs for her to hem . Each one had a tiny colored rose in the corner , and Violet was delighted with the dainty work . She sat sewing daily by the swimming pool while Benny sailed wonderful boats of chips , and waded around to his heart 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the dump-such rarities as a regular bread knife , a blue and gold soap dish , and half of a real cut glass bowl . Henry proudly deposited thirty-one dollars in the savings bank under the name of Henry James , and worked eagerly for his kind friend , who never asked him any more embarrassing questions . Benny actually learned to read fairly well . The girls occupied their time making balsam pillows for the four beds , and trying to devise wonderful meals out of very little food . Violet kept a different bouquet daily in the little vase . She had a perfect genius for arranging three purple irises to look like a picture , or a single wood lily and its leaves like a Japanese print . Each day the children enjoyed a cooked dinner , filling in the chinks with perfect satisfaction with bread and butter , or bread and milk , or bread and cheese . They named their strange house , " Home for Tramps , " and printed this title in fancy lettering inside the car . One day Jess began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that two and one make three . " I knew that before , " he said cheerfully . But it was a different matter when Jess proposed to him that two minus one left one . " No , it does not left one , " said Benny indignantly . " It left two . " " Why , Benny ! " cried Jess in astonishment . " Supposing you had two apples and I took away one , would n't you have one left ? " " You never would , " objected Benny with confidence . " No , but supposing Watch took one , " suggested Jess . " Watchie would n't take one , neither , " said Benny . " Would you , doggie ? " Watch opened one eye and wagged his tail . Jess looked at Violet in despair . " What shall I do with him ? " she asked . Violet took out her chalk and printed clearly on the outside of the boxcar the following example : 2-1 = " Now , Benny , do n't you see , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody takes away one , that you must have one left ? " " I 'll show you myself , " agreed Benny finally with resignation . " Now see the 2 ? " He actually made a respectable figure 2 on the boxcar . " Now , there 's a nice 1 . Now , s'posen I take away the 1 , do n't you see the 2 's left right on the car ? " He covered the figure 1 with his chubby hand and looked about at his audience expectantly . Jess rolled over against a tree trunk and laughed till she nearly cried . Violet laughed until she really did cry . And then something dreadful happened . Violet could not stop crying , apparently , and Jess soon made up her mind that she was really ill . She helped her carefully into the car , and heaped all the pine needles around and under her , making her the softest bed she could . Then she wet cloths in the cool water of the brook and laid them across her little sister 's hot forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Henry to come ! " she said to herself , holding Violet 's slender brown hands in her own cool ones . Henry came promptly at the usual time . He thought she had a cold , he said . And this seemed likely , for Violet began to cough gently while the rest ate a hasty supper . " We do n't want to let her go to a hospital if we can possibly help it , " said Henry , more troubled than he cared to show . " If she goes there , we 'll have to give her name , and then Grandfather will find us surely . " Jess agreed , and together the two older children kept changing the cool cloths on Violet 's aching head . But about ten o'clock that night Violet had a chill . She shivered and shook , and her teeth chattered so that Jess could plainly hear them . Nothing could warm the little girl , although she was completely packed in hay and pine needles . " I 'm going down to Dr. McAllister 's , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very ill . " Nobody ever knew how fast he ran down the hill . Even in his famous race , Henry had not made such good time . He was so thoroughly frightened that he never stopped to notice how quickly the doctor seemed to understand what was wanted . He did not even notice that he did not have to tell the doctor which way to drive his car in order to reach the hill . When the car reached the road at the base of the hill , Dr. McAllister said shortly , " Stay here in the car , " and disappeared up the hill alone . When the doctor returned , he was carrying Violet in his arms . Jess and Benny and Watch were following closely . Nobody spoke during the drive to the McAllister house as they flew through the darkness . When they stopped at last , the doctor said three words to his mother , who opened the door anxiously . Photograph <p> The three words were , " Pneumonia , I 'm afraid . " They all heard it . Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blankets , and Mrs. McAllister flew around , opening beds and bringing pillows . A trained nurse in a white dress appeared like magic from nowhere in particular . They all worked as best they could to get the sick child warmed up . Soon the hot blankets , hot water , and steaming drinks began to take effect and the shivering stopped . Mrs. McAllister left the sick room then , to tend to the other children . Henry and Benny were left in a large spare room with a double bed . Jess was put in a little dressing room next to Mrs. McAllister 's own room . Upon receiving assurances that Violet was warm again , they went to sleep . But Violet was not out of danger , for she soon grew as hot as she had been cold . And the doctor never left her side until ten o'clock the next morning . Violet , although very ill , did not have pneumonia . At about nine o'clock the doctor had a visitor . It was a man who said he would wait . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour . Then Benny drifted in . " Where is the doctor ? " asked the man sharply of Benny . " He 's upstairs , " answered Benny readily . " This means a lot of money to him , if he only knew it , " said the visitor impatiently . " Oh , that would n't make any difference , " Benny replied with great assurance as he started to go out again . But the man caught him . " What do you mean by that , sonny ? " he asked curiously . " What 's he doing ? " " He 's taking care of my sister Violet . She 's sick . " " And you mean he would n't leave her even if I gave him a lot of money ? " " Yes , that 's it , " said Benny politely . " That 's what I mean . " The visitor seemed to restrain his impatience with a great effort . " You see , I 've lost a little boy somewhere , " he said . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be about as old as you are . " Well , if you do n't find him , you can have me , I should n't wonder , " observed Benny comfortingly . " I like you . " " You do ? " said the man in surprise . " That 's because you 've got such a nice , soft suit on , " explained Benny , stroking the man 's knee gently . The gentleman laughed heartily . " No , I guess it 's because you have such a nice , soft laugh , " said Benny , changing his mind . The fact was that Benny himself did not know why he liked this stranger who was so gruff at times and so pleasant at others . He finally accepted the man 's invitation and climbed into his lap to see his dog 's picture in his watch , feeling the " nice , soft suit , " on the way . The doctor found him here when he came down at ten o'clock . Photograph <p> " Better go and find Watch , Benny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll come again , " observed Benny to his new friend . " I like your dog , and I 'm sorry he 's dead . " With that he scampered off to find Watch , who was very much alive . " I expected you , Mr. Alden , " said the doctor smiling , " only not quite so soon . " " I came the moment I got your message , " said James Alden . " Where are my grandchildren ? " " That was one of them , " said the doctor quietly . " That beautiful little boy ? " " Yes , he is beautiful , " assented Dr. McAllister . " They all are . The only trouble is , they 're all frightened that you might find them . " " How do you know that ? " asked Mr. Alden , sharply . " They 've changed their name . At least the older boy did . In public , too . " " What did he change it to ? " Dr. McAllister watched his visitor 's face closely while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A flood of recollections passed over the man 's face , and he flushed deeply . " That boy ! " he exclaimed . " That wonderful running boy ? " Then events began to move along rapidly . ( to be continued in the next issue )
