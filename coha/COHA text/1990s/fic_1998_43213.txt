WE WERE HAVING A PRETTY quiet day until the Olympian marched in to ruin things . Jetstream and Plasmo were over at the card table to swap the same old boring war stories they told each other every morning ; AnvilMan was copping some z 's , his dog-eared issue of Superwoman lying centerfold-side down on his thick plaster body cast ; Enchanter was staring at the wall , mumbling to himself , making the wallpaper do tricks for him ; Jukebox , formerly Mento , was starting in on the first few lines of " Under The Boardwalk , " and The Crime-Stomper , pinioned upside down in his traction bed , was watching Rush Limbaugh on a black-and-white TV set staring up at him from the tile floor . <p> As for me , I was in bed reading . I 've never been much of a reader ( thanks to the mugger that killed my parents when I was five , I 've never been much of anything except an Obsessed Creature of the Night ) but the last four years on Ward H had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing down my life story , just for the sake of having something to do . Not being overly familiar with the genre , I was plowing through every other cape memoir I could get my hands on just to see how the damned things were written . So far I 'd read Your Worst Nightmare , Punk , by the Noose , American Way by Flagman , and Obnoxious for Justice , by Major Butthead . They were no help at all , because apparently all you had to do to write a cape memoir was lie through your teeth about all the battles you lost in real life . And I could n't do that because I 'd sworn to always fight for truth . At least the one I was reading now , Secret Identity , had curiosity value to recommend it : I 'd known Muscleman for years , back when we were in the Liberty Squad together , and after his big change I 'd always secretly wanted to know the story behind his decision to get the operation that changed him to Warrior Woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one describing how saving Manhattan from the death ray of Dr. Fiendish had persuaded him he needed to get in touch with his soft , nurturing side-when I heard the moans ripple through the room . The Crime-Stomper muttered a bad word , Jukebox started singing Tom Petty 's " Learning to Fly , " and Jetstream , who had a talent for belaboring the obvious , said , " Cripes , it 's him . " <p> It was . The Olympian . The super-fast , super-strong , invulnerable , **26;1395;TOOLONG , square-jawed , internationally overexposed last survivor of the planet Mekton himself . The great big boy scout who was more powerful than the next hundred heroes all put together , and lived only for chances to show it . I have a contact on the Amazon Aces who says it 's all overcompensation for being hung like a thimble . He was standing in the doorway , looking huge and heroic and mythic and huge , his titanium-blue hair glistening in the light of the open window , his little curl carefully pasted to his forehead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his admirers think of as heroic and those of us who 've teamed up with him prefer to consider constipated . As he surveyed the ward , hands on hips , as if waiting for somebody to sculpt him , I said , " Hey , Limpy ! Save any stray cats from trees lately ? " <p> His monolithic head swiveled on its sequoia neck . He focused on me . " Night Rat , " he said . As I winced with the knowledge that I 'd have to talk to him now , he lumbered over and thrust out his great meaty hand . " I did not know you were in here . " <p> " Yeah . Right . Sure you did n't . " I shook his hand anyway . Who the hell needs the Strongest Man on Earth for an enemy ? <p> He gave me the once-over with his famous Diagnostic Vision . " I see no physical damage . What happened to you ? " <p> " I ran into this costumed bad guy called Nervous Rex . Tried to poison the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its victims . I managed to take him out before he dosed the water , but not before he hit me with a dart dipped in the stuff . I 'm fine most days . Other days ... " I shrugged . " Let 's just say it 's hard to fight a never-ending battle when you 're quivering on the sidewalk . What about you ? Why are you here ? Is this a photo-op ? You got some TV crew waiting outside to take pictures of you visiting the disabled veterans of super wars ? " <p> He blinked . Twice . Absorbed the question . " I brought in a new patient . They 'll be wheeling him in any minute . " <p> That broiled my bottom . The Heroic Veteran 's Administration was supposed to have regulations about the number of patients allotted to a ward . We were already past that limit , if you counted Enchanter , which we really could n't , since he uncontrollably faded in and out of existence anyway . But a new patient would definitely put us over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , his semiliquid legs bunching up around his ankles like baggy pajamas . Somewhere in his half-melted features sat the eager expression of a lonely man happy for somebody new to talk to . " Olympian ! ' He said . " Remember me ? We took out Dr. Fiendith together ? " <p> " I remember , " the Olympian said , in a voice that showed no trace of nostalgia . <p> Plasmo 's neck elongated twenty feet , whipped his head back over his shoulders , and extended the entire length of the room , just so he could face Jetstream from a distance of six inches and shout , " HA ! TOLD YOU ! " Then his neck pulled taut , yanking his head back to its previous position atop his misshapen shoulders , so he could use it to beam self-satisfaction at the Olympian . " I keep telling him you and I are partnerth , but he doeth n't believe me . But you can tell him . Remember ? Fiendith had you helpleth under a paralythith beam ? I burtht in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patch to thew on my cothtume , that thaid I wath your offithial partner from that moment on ? Remember ? Huh ? " <p> " Yes , " said the Olympian . " It was a special moment . I think about it often . " <p> The exchange so thoroughly nauseated me I had to turn away to avoid throwing up . That was nothing new with Plasmo , of course ; I do n't know about you , but there 's something about stretching powers that 's always made me physically ill . Sue me . It 's worse in Plasmo 's case , since he 's worn out all his connective tissues and ca n't quite snap back all the way anymore . <p> Still , that was n't what made me sick so much as the constant brownnosing the Olympian seems to get from so many people in our profession . Like the way they call him Earth 's Greatest Hero even though he 's not from Earth . The way they call him a hero at all when a man who can survive ground-zero nukes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any way . And the way they simper like starstruck teenage girls whenever he offers them even the slightest sign of recognition . Take that stupid patch Plasmo was so excited about . I have one too . So does everybody . The Olympian has them made in bulk . " Anyway , " I said , just to change the subject back to something relevant . " Who 's this new roomie you 're bringing us ? Somebody who 's paid his dues , I hope ? " <p> " Who did n't vote for Clinton ! " The Crime-Stomper shouted , from his inverted position on the traction bed , thus prompting Jetstream , a lifelong Democrat , to hobble over in the buckets of bum-gel he uses for shoes and change the channel from Limbaugh to Oprah . <p> The Olympian had always been opaque to irony . " I do n't think he 's a great believer in democracy . " <p> Two orderlies chose that moment to wheel in the new patient on his life-support bed . Plasmo gasped  --  nothing new , since he goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lungs from deflating . The Crime-Stomper cursed , and appealed to the spirit of America itself to heal him so he could leap across the room and throttle the new arrival with his bare hands . Jetstream said , " Jumping Jehosophat ! , " his pet exclamation , which to me always sounded stupid . Anvil-Man woke blinking , a disquieted frown forming on his bland complacent features . Enchanter shouted a series of nonsense words , summoning forth a flock of winged pigs that instantly flew out the open window . And Jukebox , formerly Mento , started singing " Behind Blue Eyes , " starting with the famous first line about how nobody knows what it 's like to be the Bad Man . Of all of us , only I remained capable of putting our horror into rational words , as <p> I leaped to my feet : " H-hey ! This a hero 's ward ! You ca n't bring him in here ! He 's a villain ! " <p> " And not jutht any villain , " Plasmo slurred . " THE villain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was and what shape he was in , Anvil-Man tried to leap out of bed . Bad move - his bones were still knitting . Even constrained as he was , it had to hurt . He aaarrrrghed . I approached the new arrival gingerly , hoping the others would blame my quivering gait on my long-standing nerve condition . Maybe that was affecting me , a little . But there was also fear : Baron Death had spent the last thirty years waging constant war on the combined forces of everything that was good and decent . Just about every hero I knew had run afoul of his evil schemes one time or another , and we all considered ourselves fortunate to have escaped with our lives . The combined forces of all Earth 's champions had just barely managed to keep his threat at bay ; up until now , even the Olympian himself - the guy who 'd once worked out a kink in his back by spending the afternoon moving the entire Himalayan mountain chain one yard to the left - had never succeeded in capturing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trademark shiny black armor had been crumpled like aluminum foil around the human form inside , leaving him not only helpless , but trapped in there , alone with the memories of his great evil , forever . Life-support tubes pierced his skin through the chinks ; the fluids passing both ways bubbled unpleasantly as the orderlies wheeled the bed into the empty spot by the front door . <p> I whirled and approached the Olympian . " All right , so I 'm fairly impressed you caught him . How could I not be ? But this is still a hero 's ward ! There 's no place for his kind in here ! " " That 's right ! " shouted The Crime-Stomper . " You want a place to put him , try the bottom of the ocean ! " <p> " Or the far side of the moon ! " added Jetstream , perhaps the only time in living memory that the two of them had ever agreed with each other . " Or the thurfathe of the thun ! " Plasmo said , probably just happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indomitable . " The jail ward is n't equipped to give him the kind of care he needs . The usual facilities for super-villains are filled with people who 'd give their right arms to break him out . He 's never actually been convicted of a crime . I have no choice but to leave him here . The Disabled Heroes Administration has already given its approval . With any luck , you 'll all be a good influence on him . " " , ... good ... ' - hey , listen , you ! Come back here ! " But he was already gone , having leaped out the window in a single bound . <p> " Bastard ! " The Crime-Stomper shouted . <p> " He'th gone , " Plasmo informed him . <p> " Hell , I know that ! But he 's the Olympian ! He 's got super-hearing ! He can still hear us cussing him out ! AI N'T THAT RIGHT , LIMPY ? YOU ALIEN ... TURD ! WE ALL KNOW YOU 'RE THAT NERDY REPORTER ! WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from the hall . She was a tough old bird , built like a fortress of solitude , and about as kindly as an evil henchman whose paycheck 's been shorted for the week . She planted her malletshaped fists on her great broad hips and demanded : " What 's all this noise ? " <p> " Nothing , ma'am , " Jetstream said . " Night Rat 's just blowing off some steam . " <p> She tsked . And it was a powerful tsk , too ; if tsking can be a superpower , bestowed by a bite from a radioactive grandmother or something , Nurse Kent was the most formidable tsker of them all . When she tsked , the disapproval just radiated off of her in waves , capable of dousing all life from a room . She waggled a long bony finger at the tip of my nose and said : " Now , you know better than that , young man . You boys need your rest . I do n't want any Titans Clashing in here . " <p> " Sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just my soul , crying out for justice . " <p> " And you know that 's not good for you . You do n't want to bring on one of your episodes , do you ? " <p> " No , Ma'am . " <p> " That 's better , " she said . She looked at the others . " Does anybody need a bedpan " <p> " I 'll take one , " said Anvil-Man . <p> She obliged , waited while he did what he had to do , gave us all stem looks , and waddled back out . It was Jetstream who broke the silence she always left behind her . " That 'll do it , Night Rat . " He made a disparaging gesture of his flamedampening gloves . " Thanks . " <p> " You think this is some kind of joke ? " I said , sotto voce . " That 's Baron forgodsake Death in that bed , mister ! " <p> " That 's right ! " Crime-Stomper cried . " I say we finish him off right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was par for the course . The Crime-Stomper 's idea of fighting crime had been leaping through a plate glass window firing Uzis with both hands . His body count was supposed to be in the low thousands . Some of them even guilty . He became the Quad he is today the first time he met somebody who could shoot back . I said , " You know I wo n't be a party to that . I never approved of killing . " <p> " I know . And that 's why the same bad guys you fought on Wednesday always escaped from prison on Thursday and had to be put away again on Friday . Pointless , was n't it ? " <p> Jetstream , whose rogue 's gallery had consisted of the same six costumed villains , all of whom went on crime sprees with the same depressing regularity as mine , said , " And ethics ? Morality ? Does n't that mean anything to you , you reactionary butthead ? " <p> " Come closer and say that , you sorry excuse for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " jukebox started singing , " Turn , Turn , Turn , Turn . " Enchanter tried to levitate , but bumped his head on the ceiling with a painful thwock that only Anvil-Man appreciated . <p> Jetstream said , " It does n't matter anyway . None of us are really up to trim these days . And he is wearing that armor of his . I do n't think there 's any way we could kill him even if we wanted to . " Anvil-Man said , " Well , I have a suggestion . " <p> Nobody asked to hear it . We knew what his suggestion was . The only trick in his reportoire was crushing bad guys with anvils from six stories up - thus earning him his famous nickname , " The Man With the Drop on Crime . " He 'd accidentally leaned out too far over the edge of a roof one day , compounded the error by not letting go of his anvil when he had a chance , and as a result had ridden his trademark weapon all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be out of here eventually ; he 'd just broken every bone in his body . The anvil in question was now a counterweight providing tension for his elevated leg . Since he could n't turn his head , he had to stare at that anvil every single waking hour of the day . Yeah , we knew what his suggestion was , all right . I said , " We 'll keep that in mind , " and , more to escape the debate than anything else , joined Plasmo at Baron Death 's bedside . <p> Plasmo glanced at me sheepishly , the oddest expression on the runny muck that passed for his face . " Peatheful , " he said , " ith n't he ? tv I looked down at the fiend who 'd once locked me in a room with five hunter-seeker robots . " Yeah , " I said . " Peaceful . " <p> Which bothered me , a little . The Baron Death I remembered had always been a pompous ass-he 'd capture you , chain you to a wall in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there the way you 'd expect a villain of his intelligence to handle it , he 'd put all his operations on hold so he could pace back and forth in front of you speechifying about all his nefarious plans . Muscleman used to say that the only reason the Baron never actually went ahead and conquered the damn planet was that he knew he would n't have any nefarious plans left to brag about once he did . Evil as he was , basically the only thing he really cared about was talking . I waved my hand in front of his eyeslits . He did n't blink . " Really , " Anvil-Man said . " I bet you , dollars to donuts , a good sock in the head with an anvil would get past that helmet of his in a New York minute . " " How would you know ? " Crime-Stomper said sourly . <p> " The same way everybody knows . I fought him once . " <p> Plasmo and I whirled , to face a room suddenly drowning in stunned silence . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saw the shock and disbelief there , and without saying a word came to the mutual conclusion that this was the single most unbelievable thing anybody had said all day . Ergo , we knew it was true . Crime-Stomper gave our incredulity a voice : " You ? YOU ... of all people ... YOU fought Baron Death ? " " Yes , " Anvil-Man mimicked , " Me , of all people , I fought Baron Death . What 's so hard to believe about that ? You do n't think I could have been a match for him ? " <p> Enchanter turned inside-out and peered at us from in between his own teeth . The rest of us knew exactly how he felt . " I think we all need to hear this story , " Jetstream said . <p> But Anvil-Man 's feelings were hurt , now . " No . To hell with you guys . I 'm going back to sleep . " " Anvil-Man ... " I began . <p> He started humming loudly , so we 'd know his withdrawal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sympathy for the Devil . " Enchanter became a toy truck , then a steam engine , then a unicorn . Plasmo and I looked at each other , rolled our eyes , and turned back to the armored figure on the life-support bed . <p> I do n't know . If it were the old Baron Death lying battered and broken , but shouting his usual brand of megalomaniacal defiance , I think I would have sided with Crime-Stomper . But this Baron Death did n't speak , did n't utter a sound , did n't give any indication that there was anything inside his crumpled armor but an equally empty shell of flesh . It was impossible to keep thinking of him as an enemy . But it was also impossible to forget what it had been like to endure his taunts while trying to escape his boobytrapped Maze of Death . I turned to Plasmo , and saw the same troubled look in his eyes . " Do you think he 's .. all there ? " <p> " He'th Baron Death , " Plasmo said simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It doeth n't make any thenthe for him to end hith dayth here . " <p> " So you think this is just some plot of his ? " <p> " I hope tho , " Plasmo said . <p> " Why ! " <p> " Becauthe I think he dethervthe better . " <p> And damned if I did n't agree with that . Because now that I thought of it , Baron Death had been one of the most honorable bad guys I 've ever encountered . He 'd attack you soon as look at you , of course - that much was a given ; in his profession , he could hardly be expected to do any less - but for all his supposed brilliance , for all the hard times he 'd given people like me and Crime-Stomper and Plasmo and the Olympian over the years , he played the game by the rules . <p> Whatever could he have done , to make a big blue boy scout like the Olympian want to reduce him to ... this ? <p> Deeply troubled now , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Somewhere deep within his armor , the arch-villain murmured incoherently . <p> I leaned in closer . " Come on , Baron . Say something . " He mumbled some more . But it was n't just meaningless gibberish though it could have translated to anything , it was also definitely spoken from some deep well of anguished desperation . <p> Only one word emerged clearly , and that one hit the room with the force of a thunderbolt : " ... danger ... " <p> It sounded nothing like Baron Death 's usual voice . <p> Crime-Stomper called from his bed : " I do n't like the sound of that . " " Me either , " I said . I turned back to Baron Death . " What kind of danger ? Tell me ! " <p> The Baron 's eyes rolled . " D-dangerous .... danger ... " Dangerous danger . The worst kind . <p> I gritted my teeth . " Something 's terribly wrong here . " Plasmo nodded , his head bobbing from side to side atop an obscenely suggestive five-foot neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I agree , " said the Enchanter , and that really cinched it , since as far as we knew he had n't spoken a coherent word since his epic battle with N'loghthl , Lord of Phlarrrrg , five years earlier . <p> We looked at Baron Death again , then looked at each other , then at the others , and finally , together , turned toward Jukebox . Once , he 'd been Mento , The Smartest Man on Earth , and I guess the name fit , even if it made him sound like a breath mint . For the five years he ran around in that ugly pink jumpsuit of his ( the one with the picture of a brain framed in an oval on his chest ) nobody had ever succeeded in defeating him in a battle of wits . And any number of criminals tried , not only devising ridiculously elaborate crimes but actually ( and I still ca n't believe how STUPID this is sending him CLUES about where they were going to strike next . You would think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of somebody who was even more brilliant than he was . But it had n't happened that way - he 'd met a bad guy who was DUMBER . A trucker named Earl , who was busting up a bar because his girlfriend had just left him . Who , being too drunk and stupid to think up any highly intricate deathtrap for Mento to cleverly escape from , just whopped him over the head with a bar stool , thus instantly turning The Smartest Man on Earth into the human oldies marathon he 's been ever since . <p> Jukebox noticed us watching him and immediately segued into " Every Breath You Take . " <p> Plasmo and I glanced at each other , and between us decided that it could n't hurt . We left Baron Death behind and sat down by Jukebox 's bed , one of us on either side . <p> He started singing " Go Away , Little Girl . " Plasmo 's arm slithered up and around the back of Jukebox , s head and wrapped itself around his mouth , effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Plasmo . <p> " My pleathure . " <p> I faced Jukebox again . " Listen . You 've seen what 's going on here . You know it 's important . You know that something about it stinks on ice . You know that if there 's something bad going down here , then we 're probably the only people in position to do anything about it . Finally , you know that this might be the last chance most of us have to make a difference in this world again . But alone , we might not be able to figure it out in time . Everything depends on you being able to fight your way out of wherever it is you 've been the last few years and give us some kind of advice that makes sense . You understand ? " <p> Was it just wishful thinking , or were his eyes regaining some of their previous focus ? I gestured for Plasmo to release him . Plasmo did- and for just a second Jukebox actually looked like he was trying to say something . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a choking noise , then opened his mouth . <p> And once again started singing . <p> This time in a deep , throaty hard-rock voice . Something about holding a girl in his arms while the band played . <p> " What ? " <p> " Brooth , " he repeated . When I failed to understand that , he amplified , " The Bawth . " When I failed to understand that too , he gave an exasperated look and spelled it out for me : " Brooth Thpringthteen . " " Great . You can name that tune . Big hairy deal . " <p> " No ! I 'm thaying I know thith thong ! I have the thee-dee . It'th called <p> ' Brilliant Dithguithe ! " ' <p> Jukebox cut off the song in mid-lyric . Blinked at us . And with a visibly tremendous effort , somehow managed to avoid singing again . <p> Brilliant Disguise . Interesting . I clapped him on the shoulder . " You done good , Ju-I mean , Mento . We 'll get back to you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandered over in the interim , his flame-retardant buckets scraping metallically against the cold tile floor . " What 's it mean ? " <p> " I 'm not sure , " I said . " But think on this : it does n't make sense for the man in that armor to be the real Baron Death . He 's the Elvis of bad guys ; if it was really the Baron , they would n't just dump him in some hole-inthe-wall ward to rot , for his people to eventually swoop down and rescue . No matter what the Olympian said . They 'd bury him in the deepest hole they could find , build an army base around it , and have the entire membership of the Niceness League , the Terrific Ten , and the Good Eggs guarding him twenty-four hours a day . He ca n't be Baron Death . And that means  --  terrifying as it might be to admit this - that the man who brought him in could n't have been the real Olympian . " <p> " Jumping Jehosophat ! " Jetstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up with a way to disguise himself as the Olympian , then the world 's in serious danger ! " <p> " Prethithely , " said Plasmo , sounding proud of himself . Jetstream began shuffling toward the outside corridor . I grabbed him by the arm . " Where the hell do you think you 're going ? " <p> " The phone , " he said , in the tone of somebody speaking to an idiot . <p> " We have to call The Danger Squad . " <p> " To hell with them , " I said fervently . <p> " What ? " <p> " You know the rules of engagement . Whoever catches the crisis fights the bad guy . No matter what the odds . No matter how high the stakes . This one ... belongs to us . " Silence reigned in the ward around us . <p> Enchanter 's eyes were saucers . Literally . He even had coffee cups on them . <p> Crime-Stomper spoke first . " No doubt about it , Night Rat . You 've lost it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him for the second time in one day , " Jetstream said . " But he 's right . Look at us . Two of us ca n't move , two of us can barely think , the three of us who can both move and think ca n't be trusted to make it down a flight of stairs . We 're not in any shape to go into battle . We could n't take out an arthritic pickpocket , even if he wanted to surrender to us . And you want us to take on the Olympian ? Or Baron Death ? Or whoever 's behind this scheme , even assuming you 're right about this being a scheme ? Get real . " <p> There was a moment of uneasy silence , during which I came very close to admitting that they were right . <p> And then Anvil-Man laughed . <p> It was a pained laugh , mostly because every chuckle strained the ribs still healing beneath his full-length body cast ; every robust " ha ! " was followed by an equally robust moan . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And they filled the room with that mythic sense of destiny that I 'd long since come to associate with the turning point of any battle . <p> We all felt it . Deep in our bones . I had just enough time to reflect that if Anvil-Man was capable of inspiringus , then we were even more pathetic than I 'd thought , before CrimeStomper whispered the set-up line : " Uh ? Anvil-Man ? What 's so funny ? " " Do n't you see it ? " Anvil-Man shouted . " If we really wanted to GET REAL , would we even BE in this business ? Winning against impossible odds is what we 're all about ! " That did it , for us . <p> The Enchanter summoned his mystic cloak from the closet . CrimeStomper let out a battle cry . Plasmo fanned out to all four corners of the room and gathered us together for a group hug . Jetstream removed his flame-dampening glove and shot off a celebratory burst of fireworks . Jukebox led us all in a rousing rendition of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nurse Kent a second time . I felt a seizure coming on , and for the first time since being shut away in this starched white prison actually managed to fight it off . <p> And just as the celebration started to pall , with everybody facing the stark realization that they did n't even have the beginnings of an idea what we were expected to do next , Jukebox sang out a ten-second medley of the Jags ' " Back of My Hand ( I 've Got Your Number ) , " Steve Miller 's " I 'm Gon na Grab Ya , " Ritchie Valens 's " Come On Let 's Go , " the Supremes ' " Nowhere to Run , " and , oddly enough , Richard Harris 's " MacArthur Park . " <p> He 'd thought of a plan ... <p> IF YOU READ any newspapers at all , you know what the explanation was . How the man in the armor was n't Baron Death , but a small-time villain called The Leech , who had the ability to absorb and store the powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicinity . We all knew the Leech , having encountered him once or twice , but he 'd never been a real threat , since it took him days to absorb enough power to make a difference , and us only thirty seconds . to put him away with a good right hook . But Baron Death had seen in him a good way to gather up all the world 's superpowers for himself - he 'd just welded the poor guy into a junked-up version of his own armor , fitted him with a neural paralyzer so he would n't be able to tap into all the power he was getting , and ordered a robotic Olympian impersonator to usher him from one superhero hangout to another , as his " prisoner , " arranging for him to " escape " every time he 'd drained the well dry . <p> A brilliant plan . One so obvious in retrospect that it 's hard to see how come we did n't see it right away . I guess that 's why Baron Death 's number one in the villain business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us as his first helpless victims . <p> You know the rest of it , too - how we escaped the hospital in a makeshift flying machine hastily constructed from our beds , and how we fought the robotic Olympian impersonator in an epic battle that flattened six square blocks of Manhattan , how we faced Baron Death in his secret laboratory beneath Disney World , and how , at the end , when the bomb that would blow up North America was ticking down its last thirty seconds and the rest of us were trapped by the Baron 's evil paralysis ray , the immobile plaster-encased form of Anvil-Man saved the day by plummeting from the rafters where we 'd left him at the precise moment the Baron removed his protective helmet to mock us with the sight of his hideously scarred face . <p> This may not strike you as a great way to regain one 's lost dignity , but it sure as hell worked for us . <p> And then , when it was over , we piloted our makeshift flying machine high over the city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay side-by-side in two forming a U , cushioned by blankets , peering down at the city through the wire mesh of the bedframes , and singing " Born to Be Wild . " We 'd mounted Crime-Stomper 's traction bed at the head of this construct , making him resemble one of the wooden figureheads that fronted nineteenth-century sailing ships . He liked that . Anvil-Man 's bed rode on top of the U , forming the upper deck - we 'd given him some weighted bedpans to drop in case we ran into any trouble out there . Jetstream straddled his body cast , flaming hands held aloft to inflate the hot air balloon we 'd made of Plasmo . As for the Enchanter , he floated along beside us , once again insubstantial , neither helping nor hindering our progress . . but though I could n't see him from where I was I somehow knew he was smiling . Eventually , Jetstream asked , " Where to ? Back to the hospital ? " <p> " No , " I said . " We ca n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not while there are still wrongs to be righted . Not while they still expect us to eat that crap they serve . No - it 's time for bad guys to beware . Because a new breed of crime-fighter is in town . " <p> That started a whole new round of cheering , which continued unabated until Crime-Stomper used his nose to ring the buzzer that he 'd used for so many years to ring the nurse : " All right . Listen up , people , I just spotted something . A rehearsal for the big time . A dark alley between a peepshow parlor and a homeless hotel . Mugger holding two tourists at gunpoint . " <p> " Take us down ! " I shouted . " This is a job for - " <p> We all shouted it together . <p> " ... THE DIFFERENTLY ABLED ! " <p> And Jetstream and Plasmo took us into a power dive , with Jukebox performing a soundtrack straight out of Wagner . This one 's for Julius Schwartz . <p> Author Affiliation     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
