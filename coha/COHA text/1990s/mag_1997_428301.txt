Section : nutrition Airlines say they 're offering healthier inflight meals , but just how healthy  --  and palatable  --  are they ? Here 's the plane truth <p> A LONG WITH the headphones and minuscule pillows and blankies , the in-flight meal is a meager perk of air travel  --  inadequate to the task at hand , but heck , as long as they 're handing stuff out , you might as well take it . No one really expects the meal to be mouthwatering , or even healthy for that matter . And on most flights , it is n't . But things are looking up . <p> For one thing , the airlines have all gone short order . Give ' em 12 to 24 hours ' notice , and they 'll whip up a low calorie , low-fat , heart-healthy , diabetic or vegetarian dish that 'll be waiting for you when you board . Even if you do n't have special restrictions , it 's smart to order a special meal every time you fly , says Morton Shaevitz , Ph.D. , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mean and lecturer on healthy eating and travel . " That way , at least you 'll know what you 're eating , " he says , " because the meal comes with nutritional information . " <p> But how do these meals really measure up in the fat and calorie departments ? And , even more important , how do they taste ? We volunteered to fly to Hawaii six times to find out . Instead , the airlines sent their chow down for a taste test . So we swallowed hard , grabbed our airsickness bags ( just in case ) and plunged right in . <p> It 's worth noting that airlines do in fact shuttle their menus around every few months or so ( which is why TWA , US , Airways and Delta respectfully declined to send us meals ) . Ask about your options when you book your flight . While the particular dishes we talk about here might not be available , the general quality of the offerings will probably be pretty consistent . We 've done our own rankings , based on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) flight attendants . Let the flyer beware . American Airlines <p> From American 's standard coach service , we tried a Buffalo chicken-breast salad . The " Buffalo " sauce was a bland letdown , but the chicken was n't bad  --  until we read the fine print . Although the meal appeared to be pretty healthy ( just 174 calories ) , it packed 11 g of fat ( for 57 percent calories from fat ) , with 44 mg cholesterol and 982 mg sodium . Nothing to rave about . <p> The vegetarian offering , a bulgurwheat and rice melange with mixed vegetables , could have been worse . Overall the dish was fairly healthy : 310 calories , 10 g fat ( 29 percent calories from fat ) , 500 mg sodium and no cholesterol . <p> The " heart-healthy " meal  --  a breaded " Honey-Dipped Chicken " dish  --  was almost too sweet , but filling . The meal had 410 calories , 6 g fat ( 13 percent calories from fat ) , 521 mg sodium and 86 mg cholesterol . <p> The low-car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was acceptable , but not spicy enough to be called Thai food . It weighed in at 481 calories , 14 g fat ( 26 percent calories from fat ) , 395 mg sodium and 66 mg cholesterol . <p> OUR PICK : The Thai chicken pasta salad strikes the best balance between taste and nutrition . OVERALL RATING : 2 Continental <p> The standard cabin-fare turkey sandwich we tried was great : crisp lettuce , freshly baked bun , oven-roasted meat . It was as good as anything from your corner deli . Special-order it as a low-fat meal , and it 's served with mustard and a slice of angel food cake ( for 346 calories and 2 g fat  --  just 5 percent calories from fat  --  15 mg cholesterol and 1,023 mg sodium ) . The regular sandwich comes with mayo and a small candy bar ( 548 calories and 13 g fat  --  for a still-not-bad 21 percent calories from fat  --  20 mg cholesterol and 1,160 mg sodium ) . <p> From the vegetarian menu , we tried Continental 's red-bean Creole burrito . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole-grain tortilla . With a side of picante sauce , carrots and a cookie , the whole meal weighed in at 304 calories and 4 g fat ( 11 percent calories from fat ) , zero cholesterol , 472 mg sodium OUR PICK : The Creole burrito ( vegetarian menu ) is a fiesta for your tastebuds . Healthy , too . OVERALL RATING : 3 Northwest Airlines <p> Northwest sent us four meals , and they were mostly stinkers . <p> Their standard cabin fare , teriyaki chicken , had the texture and flavor of a mushy hot dog in alarmingly sweet teriyaki sauce . The complete meal , including roll , margarine and cookies , got just 22 percent of calories from fat ( that 's 20 g of fat ) , but we 're talking 820 calories and a staggering 2,555 mg sodium and 105 mg cholesterol . <p> The low-fat , low-cholesterol chicken Oriental was n't much better . At 283 calories and 5 g of fat ( 14 percent calories from fat ) , this entree wo n't bust your gut  --  assuming you eat it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Served with a spinach and radish salad , the meal delivers 91 mg cholesterol and 282 mg sodium . <p> The two Northwest meals we enjoyed most were special-order vegetarian meals . Their vegan entree was a nondescript grain , served with glazed fruit that gave it a juiciness most vegan airline meals lack . Served with a vegetable-rice mixture , fruit , salad and low-fat crackers , the meal weighs in at 403 calories , 12 g fat ( 27 percent calories from fat ) , 343 mg sodium and zero cholesterol . <p> Even better was the vegetable lasagna . This thick chunk of pasta contained spinach , ricotta cheese and shaved carrots , served under a white sauce . But finish the complete meal , and you 'll down 599 calories and 30 g fat ( 45 percent calories from fat ) , 1,051 mg sodium and 45 mg cholesterol . " Vegetarian " does n't necessarily mean " low-fat . " <p> OUR PICK : Go for the vegan entree But bring along some fruit to beat back your hunger . OVERALL RATING : 2 United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but its own meals are so impressive who would want to ? United teamed up with cookbook author Sheila Lukins to develop a whole menu of eclectic meals for coach class . We tried the Devilishly Good Roasted Chicken  --  in a spicy onion gravy with mashed potatoes and carrots  --  and the Sunny South Beach Chicken , with a tangy garlic prune glaze , butternut squash and mashed potatoes . <p> After downing these foods , we figured they had to be packing some impressive fat and cholesterol numbers . But we were pleasantly surprised : The Devilishly Good Chicken had 260 calories , 10 g fat ( 35 percent calories from fat ) , 1,140 mg sodium and 50 mg cholesterol . The Sunny South Beach Chicken had 270 calories , 8 g fat ( 27 percent calories from fat ) , 1,090 mg sodium and 45 mg cholesterol . Not terrible . <p> United 's heart-healthy meal was  --  surprise !  --  a chicken breast . But the fresh chopped basil and shiitake mushrooms were a nice touch . This dish weighed in at 486 calories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 929 mg sodium and 40 mg cholesterol . <p> The vegetarian plate at least looked tasty  --  vegetable patties of rolled oats , peas , carrots , corn , broccoli , mushrooms and soy flour . A bit chalky and dry , but undeniably healthy , with 578 calories , 2 g fat ( 3 percent calories from fat ! ) , 718 mg sodium and no cholesterol . <p> OUR PICK : The Sunny South Beach Chicken ( regular coach entree ) is downright tasty at just 270 calories and less than 30 percent calories from fat . But in general , it 's hard to go wrong with anything from United 's menu . OVERALL RATING : 4 Mayday ! Mayday ! Avert dietary disaster with these easy tips <p> So you 're not on one of these airlines . Or maybe you are , but they served you something that looks like it was scraped off the floor of the cargo hold . Relax . To avoid midair collisions with fatty foods , just follow this preflight checklist , courtesy of Morton Shaevitz , Ph.D. , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Henry 's Marketplace , a natural-foods store chain based in San Diego . Both are experts on healthy eating strategies for travelers . <p> Taste everything , finish nothing . " The trick is to satisfy yourself , " says Shaevitz . " If you eat all of a meal you know is bad for you , you 'll likely end up feeling stuffed and sick . Skip the meal and you feel cheated . Instead , take one or two bites of everything on the tray . " <p> Hit the bar . You 've heard that packing a bagel or an apple in your carry on bag is shrewd , if boring , insurance against scary airline food . A better option , Milligan suggests , is a sports bar , such as a PowerBar or Clif Bar . They 're sturdy , portable and filling . <p> Just add water . A cup of instant soup can also be an excellent ( and healthy ) way to stave off hunger at 30,000 feet . ( Ask the flight attendant for hot water . ) " Check the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be loaded with it . <p> Be a two-fisted drinker . On an airplane , high altitude and dry , pressurized air suck the juice right out of you . " All too often , we mistake thirst for hunger , then dig into any old thing put before us , " says Milligan . Instead , when the beverage cart rolls through , order a decaffeinated soft drink or juice and also ask for a glass of water . Try to avoid alcohol , which can further dehydrate you and cause blood sugar levels to drop , making you ravenous . <p> Tear into Tom Clancy . " If you 're digesting a book instead of an unwelcome airline meal that you 're eating because you 're bored , you 're going to be a lot better off , " says Milligan . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Flying American ?
