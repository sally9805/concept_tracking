This for the two stones inside me , The two shadows gone from me -- That they may begin to understand . At night , because it is summer and the air is hot and close , the mosquitoes float like snowflakes over the bog . I step onto the peat , which gives like a mattress , and the insects circle me in clouds . When I was a child playing here , my flesh was plump and sweet and they flocked to me and drank my blood ; now I am no longer a girl , but still they swarm me . On my bog there is heat lightning , and lightning bugs too , blinking across the pond which grows bigger one year , smaller the next . In the beginning I thought that pond would mark my life , its circle growing smaller every year , hemmed in by the peat until it was only a puddle , a drop , a memory in the sludge . Then I noticed how the mass of floating land inched forward one year only to inch back the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long straight road if you live it right , but mine has turned and tumbled . In 1829 , when I was born , she picked my name from an article in The Ladies ' Pearl . Aimee . At Factory Improvement Circle , I learned how in French it meant Loved . My mother did not know . " It was a lady 's name , " she told me . " You were born with fingernails like a lady 's . You waved your fingers in the air and howled like you owned the world . " First I was loved , like my name . Then I was unloved . Now I have Amos and Plumey who visit me , the village cripple and the village orphan , as they are known in town . I have my rabbits who give me fur to spin into yarn . I have my house , built to last , chickens who leave me eggs , clear vision and a strong back , a mother I never see . Amos brings me trinkets and sings me songs about pretty girls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In beauty I am no longer a great believer , nor proud the way I used to be . It is a fact that I was prettier than most at the factory , pretty as an angel , I was told . When the strangers came through , the factory owners from England looking at how it was done , I was one of the girls who was led to the front looms and asked to demonstrate . When the men from Washington came through , I was one of the girls to carry the banner : " Welcome to the City of Spindles . " We wore white muslin dresses with blue sashes that day . We carried parasols edged in green . We marched singing to the factory : " How Doth the Busy Bee . " Afterwards they made us give the dresses back . I wove that , I wanted to say , or if not that one , then one like it . I knotted the knots when the thread broke , and ran from one crashing loom to another , and threaded the two thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mine , I wanted to say . I only looked like an angel . Perhaps if I had been named something else , things would have turned out differently . I might have been named Charity , or Faith , perhaps , or Grace . But Grace can go crooked and Charity is often no more than a guilty conscience , and of Faith I have my portion -- or would I still be waiting every day ? This morning , like most mornings , I make my way over the peat and wash my face in the dark green water of the pond at the center of the bog . Once a fortnight in the mild seasons I bathe there , too , and if I raise my leg to see the kiss of a black leech or feel a water snake circle my ankle , I do not shriek the way I would have as a child , do not flounder and splash and make the birds cock their heads toward my voice . A leech is a leech ; a water snake , a water snake . I am in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare as when I was born , and if they come while I am bathing -- if the tribes of boys or some hunters spot me there -- I try to take no notice , but keep cleaning myself with my sponge of brownish moss . The hunters , when they see me bathing , crash like awkward bears into the woods . The boys , when they come , usually hide behind trees and peek at me , but today they grow brave and start to chant : There once was a woman and what do you think ? Bok bok bok ! She lived upon nothing but victuals and drink . Bok bok bok ! And though victuals and drink were the whole of her diet , this dirty woman would never keep quiet ! Then they stick out their necks , fold their arms into their armpits and flap like chickens . " Never mind them , " I can hear Amos saying , though he is not there . " Just a stupid song they 'll sing about anybody . They did n't even make it up . " But later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circling my head , I must wonder : What do most people live on ? What do I ? " Victuals , " I might have told the boys , " and drink and love . " The chickens and rabbits are scrambling with hunger , so I feed them . The twig brooms I started yesterday are crooked , so I trim them . In this way , the hours pass . It is almost noon when Amos comes to me with blueberries and sits down for a cleaning . They did a poor job of it , the doctors who cut and sewed him up . Over the years the skin on the end of his thigh has healed in deep folds like the inside of a navel . Amos will not clean himself , says it makes the bile in his stomach rise . He sits on a log stool by my door and unpins his coverall leg , and I lower myself down , kneel , and lean over the place where he lost his calf to gangrene , the surface veined and marbled with a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , " I tell , " the way you treat it . " " Clean , " says Amos , " or I 'll throw the berries to the birds . " He tries to whistle a birdsong , but it comes out thin and plain . " The blueberries come in strong this year ? " I ask him . I dip my rag in the water he has carried in a bucket from the bog pond and begin to wipe . He shakes his head . " I found you all there is in the state of New Hampshire . Spent a week going after them . " " I found some myself , " I say , " with Plumey -- the low , wild ones . We meant to pick enough for a pie , but we kneeled right down and ate them there . " " If you have found honey , " Amos tells me in his holy voice , " eat only enough for you , lest you be sated with it and vomit . " He was studying to be a preacher before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a woman and all faith in the workings of the Lord . " Stay still , " I tell him , for he is squirming , the skin still tender , he says , after all these years , the ghost of his leg still begging to be scratched . The bog water is cloudy in the bucket but clear on my rag -- strong , preserving water ; bodies in the bog do not decay . Cows have been found along the bottom whole years after they went missing , still with flesh on their bones and their brandings left intact . People , too , though not in my lifetime . A witch , they say , with recipes for potions scratched needle-thin up and down her body . A hunter with his quiver of arrows still strapped to his back . No maggots and worms do their speedy work here . Water like this does not forget . I pour the water over the skin , into the scarred folds so that they fill like rivers at melting time , then run into a waterfall down where his calf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rub my fingertips stained green with juices along the ridges of his stump to keep the rash away . Month after month I have tended Amos 's leg , year after year . In the beginning , he would hardly look at me , his mouth pressed in a bitter line , but then one day he must have felt how my hands were touching him where he would not even touch himself , for his hands moved from where they were clenched at his sides to rest lightly on my head . I did not smile or look up , except deep inside myself . I cleaned . He did not ask me to do it , the first time -- so many years ago by now . He had fallen in the woods , not far from my house , and I found him with his wooden leg cradled in his arms , his wound new then , the bandage come undone , attracting flies . I brought a bucket of water to where he was , cleaned him off , wrapped him up . He was silent , went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned with a jug of cider strapped to his back , sat by my house and rolled up his trouser leg . That was the start of us ; soon the town was talking . Soon Amos was staying through the night . " Say another part of the Book , " I tell him now , not because I want to learn how to walk on the righteous path , but because I have been hearing those words for longer than I can remember and love the turnings of his voice . He grins , shifts on the log that is his seat , and says , " Your lips distill nectar , my bride . Honey and milk are under your tongue . The scent of your garments is the scent of Lebanon . " " Another part , " I say . " Why not this ? " " No nectar in the cupboard , and I 'm not a bride . " And Amos answers , " All right , the scent of your garments is the scent of your rabbits ? " I can not help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I open my mouth and lift my tongue . Amos peers , but when he gets close I clamp my mouth shut . " Nothing , " I say . " No honeybees or snakes . " " They 're just hiding , " says Amos . " Let me see . " He cups my chin and tries to kiss me . " Stop , " I laugh . " I have to wash you . You 'd think we were children . " " Come here , pretty girl . " " I 'm no girl . " " But pretty . " I believe Amos when he says he likes how the skin around my eyes shows the prints of where I 've been . We get better and better , like fine wine , he said to me last week , and I pictured how vinegar turns to cider , cider to wine -- rich , full , and only slightly bitter . Time , I thought , as I lay in Amos 's arms , is supposed to smooth the edges of all things , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with shards ? Now I lean forward and run my finger down his face , over the curve of his steep nose , along the cleft above his lip . He is older than I am by four years . His face is scarred from the pox , lined from the weather ; his hands are rough from work . But his eyes are the deep , keen gray of slate after a rainstorm -- slate flecked with the yellow hanging-ons of moss . " Ca n't stay , " he says , nibbling my palm . " Too much work to do . " " It ca n't wait ? " He shakes his head . " What is it ? " " A new henhouse door at the Bacons ' . A fox keeps getting through . " " The Bacons ? " " They came a few months ago , related to the Prescotts somehow , living over on Osterhold 's land . " " How many of them ? " " A Mister and Missus and four or five little porkers . And the mother , they brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " An old lady ? " He shrugs . " Not so old , old enough . Like some other mothers . " He pauses to let his silence gather , but I will not linger there . " Time to go , " I say briskly , though we both know he is not going anywhere . I must still wind his leg with bandage , pick up the wooden part , strap it on with the leather thongs and let the blue cloth fall . I must cover him up until he becomes something the people will look at when he goes to town . I will wash him clean as the inner petals of a bud . " Get along , " I say , but I take my own sweet time . On the beams of my house are things I have not thrown away : a shell comb , a brooch pin wound with hair , a blue sash , letters from my mother . Over the door hangs my rifle , my powderhorn , and bullet pouch . At night , sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are foxes in the woods , and owls . In the twelve feet by twelve feet of my house , my rabbits eat from my hand . I give them oats and barley , apples , corn and carrots . Outside , milkweed and lupine could kill them , mudholes could suck them down . " Shush , " I say , stroking back their ears . Near the door I have hung a salt lick on a piece of wire . When I set the blind one before it , she lifts her nose and sniffs , then licks , and I watch as she tastes comfort in its roughest shape , the salt of tears and skin . Plumey , who has no parents , sleeps in town , in the Doctor 's house . Amos sleeps , most nights , in his cottage at the foot of Red Skunk Hill . My father is under the ground , not preserved in the bog . My brother Jeremiah died of consumption when I was still at the mills ; my sister Harriet died of a thickness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . They lie beside my father in the churchyard . My brothers Thomas and John live out West -- a place I can not picture and will never see . And my mother ? Just through the fields , over the hill , living out her days with my brother Luke in the house where I grew up . A few heartbeats , a short walk , an impossible distance away . Still , it must be said that in my way , I am rarely alone . My thoughts have been dense with voices , thick with bodies , and I have heard coughs and hiccups , breaths and cries and other things . Sometimes the crowd inside my head makes the days move faster . Other times the days move slowly , and I worry that I am nothing but a stubborn woman spiraling in on herself -- the way they must think of me in town . Mostly the days move like days , and sometimes I gather things to eat or tend the animals , and sometimes I sit with Plumey on the bank , and sometimes I lie back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I were birthing . Or I lie on my side with my head bowed and my knees tucked to my chest , as if I were waiting to be born .
