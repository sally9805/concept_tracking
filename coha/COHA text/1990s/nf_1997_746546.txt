American Bar Association of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar <p> Set forth below are the proposed revisions to the Standards and Interpretations , Rules of Procedure , and Policies of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar . <p> Only those Standards and Interpretations which have been revised are set forth below . Also , those Policies which were deemed relevant have been moved to the Standards and Interpretations or the Rules of Procedure , and are disclosed as part of the indicated revisions . The remainder of the Policies have been deleted from this revision . Consequently , it is proposed that there no longer will be a topic heading entitled " Policies . " <p> The American Bar Association has recently completed a comprehensive recodification of the Standards for Approval of Law Schools and Interpretations . At the time this book was printed , however , the Association had not yet completed an additional review of the Rules of Procedure for Approval of Law Schools and the Policies of the Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States District Court for the District of Columbia entered the Consent Decree proposed by the American Bar Association and the U.S. Department of Justice as the Final Judgment in the litigation between those parties .

FOREWORD <p> Concern for improving the competence of those entering the profession was a major reason for creating the American Bar Association in 1878 . These Standards for the Approval of Law Schools by the American Bar Association are promulgated to serve this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving the legal profession through legal education . <p> Accrediting Agency of Law . Since 1952 the Council of the section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar has been approved by the U.S. Department of Education as the recognized national agency for the accreditation of professional schools of law . It is the Council and not the Association which is so recognized . As a non-governmental accrediting agency it has been a member since 1966 of the national organization of peer professional accrediting agencies  --  initially the National Commission on Accrediting , then the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation and then the Council on recognition of Postsecondary Accreditation . This body has now been succeeded by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation . <p> The vast majority of the highest courts of the states rely upon the Association approval of a law school to determine whether their legal education requirement for admission to the bar is satisfied . Obviously , whether a jurisdiction requires education at an ABA approved law school is a decision made by a jurisdiction 's bar admission authority and not by the Council nor the ABA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for admission to the bar should have graduated from a law school approved by the ABA , that graduation from a law school alone should not confer the right of admission to the bar , and that every candidate for admission should be examined by public authority to determine fitness for admission . <p> History . The American Bar Association ( ABA ) in 1879 established as one of its first committees , the Standing Committee on Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar . In 1893 , the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar was established as the Association 's first section . Recognizing the need to take further steps to improve legal education , the Section leadership played the major role in creating the Association of American Law Schools in 1900 , giving it a modest regulatory role through requirements for membership . In 1921 the American Bar Association promulgated its first Standards for Legal Education . <p> To administer its program of approval of law schools meeting the Standards , the ABA in 1927 employed Professor H. Claude Horack of the University of Iowa College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Professor Millard H. Ruud of the University of Texas was appointed in 1968 to replace Advisor to the Section Dean John G. Hervey of Oklahoma City University School of Law , the title was changed to Consultant on Legal Education to the American Bar Association to recognize the broader responsibilities of the position . Professor James P. White of Indiana University School of Law  --  Indianapolis succeeded Professor Ruud in January 1974 and continues to serve in that position . <p> A major revision of the 1921 Standards and its Factors was promulgated in 1973 . This process began in the late 1960s . The first draft was distributed for comment in December 1971 to the chief appellate judge in each state , deans of all approved law schools , and members of the Section . About one hundred practitioners , judges , deans , and law teachers participated in discussions of the first and second drafts in April and May 1972 . The Section at its annual meeting on August 15 , 1972 approved the Standards . During its midyear meeting of February 12 , 1973 , the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Standards and Rules Revision . In 1988 Judge Henry Ramsey , Jr. , of the Alameda County , California , Superior Court and Chair-Elect of the Section , was asked to chair a study of the accreditation process . The purpose of the study was to determine what changes were needed to conform the Rules of Procedure to the Criteria of Nationally Recognized Accrediting Agencies and Associations promulgated by the United States Department of Education . A number of revisions to the rules of Procedure , both conforming the Rules to the DOE Criteria and making other changes to improve the process , were adopted by the Council in 1989 . <p> In 1992 the Council launched a formal revision of the Standards and their interpretations . Two decades of amending and adding particular standards and interpretations left the Standards and Interpretations with some apparent inconsistencies in substance and certainly in drafting style . A five-person subcommittee of the Standards Review Committee undertook a formal revision of the Standards and their Interpretations . The style rules of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws were used as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee reviewed the drafts . In response to the drafting subcommittee 's request , the Committee resolved ambiguities and apparent inconsistencies . <p> The completion of the formal revision permitted the Standards Review Committee to turn its attention to substantive revision . The process was begun in 1994 . The product of that process was circulated for comment and extensive hearings were held on the proposals . The revised Standards were approved by the Council and overwhelmingly adopted by the House of Delegates in August , 1996 . <p> The Standards recognize and encourage diversity in curriculum , methods of instruction , and among students , faculty , and staff . The Association believes that this diversity advances the course of quality legal education . <p> Wahl Commission . In April 1994 the Council established the Commission to Study the Substance and Process of the American Bar Association 's Accreditation of American Law Schools . Justice Rosalie E. Wahl of the Supreme Court of Minnesota and a former chairperson of the Section accepted appointment as chairperson . Members of the Commission included two appellate court justices , six practitioners , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABA , six Deans , and the general counsel of a state bar association . <p> The Wahl Commission 's mandate was to conduct a thorough , independent examination of all aspects of law school accreditation by the ABA . Upon the basis of hearings , solicited written comments , and surveys , the Commission prepared a report for submission at the 1995 annual meeting of the ABA . <p> Validity and Reliability . Dr. William J. McLeod , former vice president of the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation , served as consultant to the Council of the Section for its review of the validity and reliability of the Standards . In his 1989 report to the Council , Dr. McLeod concluded , upon the basis of his review of the Standards and their administration , and the deliberations at the 1989 Conference on Validity and Reliability of the Standards , that the overall objectives of the American Bar Association 's program of accreditation of law schools are : to ensure that legal education programs are of acceptable quality ; to improve the quality of legal education in the United States ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , responsibility , and conduct ; to protect the integrity of legal education and preserve its independence from inappropriate interference in its educational activities ; to encourage equal opportunities for legal education and for access to membership in the legal profession to qualified persons , including those from groups who are or have been subjected to any form of discrimination ; and to assure bar admissions authorities that the quality of legal education provided by approved schools satisfies their legal education requirements for admission to the bar . <p> In response to the Department of Education , the Council again embarked on a validity and reliability study of the Standards , in addition to the Section 's continuing efforts to assure the validity and reliability of the Standards . Dr. William J. McLeod was again employed as consultant to the Council . On December 8 , 1995 a special committee formulated with Dr. McLeod the plans for a six-year study which was received by the Council at its February , 1996 meeting . <p> DOJ Consent Decree . In June 1995 , the United States Department of Justice filed a civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws in the accreditation program . The Proposed Final Judgment required that the ABA establish a special commission to determine whether the Standards . Interpretations , and Rules of Procedure should be revised with respect to six matters . It was agreed by the Department and the ABA that the Wahl Commission 's mandate be enlarged to include these matters and its tenure be continued . In response to this additional mandate , on November 27 , 1995 the Wahl Commission submitted a supplement to its August 3 , 1995 report . <p> The civil suit was concluded by a final consent decree that was approved in June 1996 . It includes a number of requirements concerning the Standards , many of which reflect revisions that the ABA had previously adopted . Among them are that compensation paid to faculty , deans , or staff may not be considered or even collected by the ABA in the accreditation process . An exception is permitted where there is a complaint about discrimination . Also , the Standards may not specify that an approved law school may grant advanced standing for credit earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only from an approved law school as a condition of eligibility for a post-J.D. degree program . The requirements of the consent decree apply only to the ABA in its accreditation function , not to an approved law school . <p> Council Responsibility . The Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar recommends approval of law schools located in the United States , its territories , and possessions . It also approves foreign summer programs , semester abroad programs , cooperative programs for foreign study , and individual student study abroad programs . It also acquiesces in the establishment of post-J.D. programs conducted by approved law schools . <p> Standards . The Standards describe the requirements a law school must meet to obtain and retain ABA approval . Consequently they are stated as " shall " or " must " rules , depending whether the verb is in the active or passive voice . There are , however , some " should " rules . Experience has demonstrated that following the " should " rule will enable a law school to provide a program of sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice of peers . " Should " rules are consistent with this aspect of accreditation . If the Accreditation Committee notes that a law school is not complying with a " should " rule , it may note that as a matter of concern in its action letter . <p> Interpretations . The Interpretations developed by the Council and its Accreditation Committee in applying the Standards to matters before them just recently became part of institutional memory . In due course the process was formalized and the Interpretations were formally adopted by the Council and published . The Department of Justice antitrust action resulted in a consent decree that requires that both Standards and Interpretations be adopted by the ABA House of Delegates . <p> Rules of Procedure . The Rules of Procedure implement the Standards . The Rules were revised in 1989 , and are amended from time to time . The consent decree requires that the rules also be approved by the House of Delegates . <p> Criteria for Approval of Foreign Programs . Under its authority " to adopt rules implementing the Standards " the Council has adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Criteria for Approval of Foreign Summer Programs ( June 1991 , June 1994 , June 1996 , and August 1996 ) ; the Criteria for Approval of Semester Abroad Programs for Credit Granting Foreign Segment of Approved J.D. Programs ( November 1992 , June 1994 , June 1996 , and August 1996 ) ; the Criteria for Approval of Individual Student Study Abroad for Academic Credit ( August 1993 , and June 1994 ) ; and the Criteria for Approval of Cooperative Programs for Foreign Study ( August 1993 , June 1994 , and June 1996 ) . American Bar Association Recodification of the Standards August 1996 Interpretation 101-3 : <p> Accreditation or approval of a law school by the American Bar Association is not transferable . A transfer of all , or substantially all , of the academic programs or assets of ( 1 ) a law school or ( 2 ) a university or college of which the law school is a part does not include the transfer of the law school 's accreditation status . Interpretation 102-5 : <p> A provisionally approved law school shall state in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law school . Similarly , when it refers to its approval status in publicity releases and communications with all students , applicants or other interested parties , it shall state that it is a provisionally approved law school . Interpretation 102-6 : <p> An unapproved law school seeking provisional approval must include the following language in its bulletin : <p> The Dean is fully informed as to the Standards and Rules of Procedure for the Approval of Law Schools by the American Bar Association . The Administration and the Dean are determined to devote all necessary resources and in other respects to take all necessary steps to present a program of legal education that will qualify for approval by the American Bar Association . The Law School makes no representation to any applicant that it will be approved by the American Bar Association prior to the graduation of any matriculating student . Interpretation 105-1 : <p> Major changes in the program or structure of legal education of a law school include : <p> ( 1 ) Instituting a new full-time or part-time division ; <p> ( 2 ) Changing from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full-time program ; <p> ( 3 ) Establishing a two-year undergraduate/four-year law school or similar program ; <p> ( 4 ) Establishing a new or different program leading to a degree in addition to the J.D. degree ; <p> ( 5 ) Merging or affiliating with one or more approved or unapproved law schools ; <p> ( 6 ) Merging or affiliating with one or more universities ; <p> ( 7 ) Materially modifying the law school 's legal status or institutional relationship with a parent institution ; <p> ( 8 ) Acquiring another law school or educational institutions ; <p> ( 9 ) Acquiring or merging with another university by the parent university where it appears that there may be substantial impact on the operation of the law school ; <p> ( 10 ) Transferring all , or substantially all , of the academic program or assets of the approved law school to another law school or university ; and <p> ( 11 ) Opening of a branch operation . ( August 1996 ) Interpretation 211-1 : <p> This standard does not specify the forms of concrete actions a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligation . The satisfaction of such obligation is based on the totality of its actions . Among the kind of actions that can demonstrate a school 's commitment to providing equal opportunities for the study of law and entry into the profession by qualified members of groups that have been the victims of discrimination are the following : <p> a . Participating in job fairs and other programs designed to bring minority students to the attention of employers . <p> b . Establishing procedures to review the experience of minority graduates to determine whether their employers are affording equal opportunities to members of minority groups for advancement and promotion . <p> c . Intensifying law school recruitment of minority applicants , particularly at colleges with substantial numbers of minority students . <p> d . Promoting programs to identify outstanding minority high school students and college undergraduates , and encouraging them to study law . <p> e . Supporting the activities of the Council on Legal Education Opportunity ( CLEO ) and other programs that enable more disadvantaged students to attend law school . <p> f . Creating a more favorable law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supporting minority student organizations , promoting contacts with minority lawyers , and hiring minority administrators . <p> g . Encouraging and participating in the development and expansion of programs to assist minority law graduates to pass the bar . <p> h . Developing and implementing specific plans designed to increase the number of minority faculty in tenure and tenure-track positions by applying a broader range of criteria than may customarily be applied in the employment and tenure of law teachers , consistent with maintaining standards of quality . <p> i . Developing programs that assist in meeting the unusual financial needs of many minority students , as provided in Standard 211 . Interpretation 211-2 : <p> Each ABA approved law school ( 1 ) shall prepare a written plan describing its current program and the efforts it intends to undertake relating to compliance with Standard 211 , and ( 2 ) maintain a current file which will include the specific actions which have been taken by the school to comply with its stated plan . Interpretation 301-1 : <p> Among the factors to be considered in assessing the extent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attrition rate of the school 's students , and the bar passage and career placement rates of its graduates . Interpretation 304-3 : <p> Credit for a J.D. degree shall only be given for course work taken after the student has matriculated in a law school . A law school may not grant credit for work taken in special pre-admission programs . Students enrolled in a special pre-admission program may not be considered as matriculated law students since their prospective admission to law school is conditional , among other matters , upon their successful completion of the pre-admission program . ( August 1996 ) Standard 508 . ENROLLMENT OF NON-DEGREE CANDIDATES . <p> Without requiring compliance with its admission standards and procedures , a law school may enroll an individuals in a particular course or limited number of courses , as an auditors , non-degree candidates , or candidates for a degree other than a law degree provided that such enrollment does not adversely affect the quality of the course or the law school program . ( 1 ) a student enrolled in other colleges or universities or in other departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part ; and ( 2 ) a member of the bar , a graduate of other approved law schools , and other persons satisfying the requirements for admission set forth in Standard 502 . Interpretation 509-3 : <p> All law schools shall have and make publicly available a student tuition and fee refund policy . This policy shall contain a complete statement of all student tuition and fees and a schedule for the refund of student tuition and fees . Standard 510 . Student Loan Programs . A law school shall take reasonable steps to minimize student loan defaults , including provision of debt counseling at both the inception of a student 's loan obligations and prior to graduation . Interpretation 510-1 : <p> The student loan default rates of a law school 's graduates , including any reasons of financial or compliance audits and reviews , shall be considered in assessing the extent to which a law school complies with this Standard . Interpretation 510-2 : <p> The law school 's obligation shall be satisfied if the university , of which the law school is a part , provides to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appendix 2 <p> A. Background and Discussion of Educational Effect <p> ( 1 ) Background . A series of actions by the Accreditation Committee , over the period 1975-78 , together with the Committee 's analysis of statistics from the last decade of law school growth in the United States , indicate a deterioration in legal education of the values and academic opportunities which Standards 201 and 401-405 are designed to insure . It has become clear that ratios of students to full-time faculty have increased remarkably . Attention to this fact and to the educational effects of the size of the full-time law faculty has increased its determination to become more rigorous . <p> ( 2 ) Every approved school is required by Standard 105 now Standard 104 to improve its educational program beyond the minimum requirements of Standards 201 , 401-405 . Under Standards 201 , 401-405 , this duty is subject to inquiry in terms of ratio and of the effect of faculty size . <p> B. Educational Effect . Inquiry into the effect of the size of a full-time faculty takes into account every aspect of Standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the following : <p> ( 1 ) A school should be prepared to demonstrate an acceptable allocation of students to each member of the full-time faculty . One method of analyzing the allocation of students is in terms of student-hour loads ( students times hours per week in class ) . In a less statistical perspective , a school should take into account that heavy student-hour loads have an adverse effect on scholarship and on time for the reflection which good teaching requires . <p> ( 2 ) Effect on Small-Group Classes . Legal educators have traditionally found special value in classes of fewer than 30 minutes each . The Committee has recently , and in several cases , required extensive documentation on size of classes in schools which are before it , in an effort to find out whether the average student spends a significant amount of class time in groups where collaborative teaching techniques ( simulation , clinical work , close discussion ) are possible , and there can be hope for personal relationships with teachers . In most cases , these small classes are in either specially-sectioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , typically , they are taught by full-time faculty . The intellectual difference is that required or core courses are in basic subjects ( contracts , torts , corporations ) and electives are in the more specialized areas to which a maturing teacher tends to devote special interest ( legal history , estate planning , business planning , juvenile law , mass communications law , products liability ) . There are two disadvantages in a program which does not seek this small-class effect . <p> ( a ) Faculty are denied the experience of teaching small groups of students , with the attendant rapport and personal growth which the small group provides for a teacher . <p> ( b ) Faculty are denied the intellectual experience of ordering and teaching a subject which is more complex and specialized than elementary law school instruction . <p> Both disadvantages have student-centered implications . Legal educators assume that a full-time , experienced teacher knows how to use the advantages of small groups and specialized subject matter . The result of the teacher 's opportunity in these courses will be better and more innovative teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not benefit from larger classes . <p> The typical law student should spend a substantial part of his or her education in small classes taught by full-time teachers . Students who are denied this experi <p> groups and specialized subject matter . The result of the teacher 's opportunity in these courses will be better and more innovative teaching methods , methods which benefit students in ways students do not benefit from larger classes . The typical law student should spend a substantial part of his or her education in small classes taught by full-time teachers . Students who are denied this experience are denied one of the principal benefits which Standards 401-405 are meant to give them . <p> ( 3 ) Effect of Pervasive Large Classes . A normal effect of a favorable student/facility ratio is that some elementary law courses are taught in small groups . The advantages to student and teacher are similar to those of small classes in elective courses , but the advantages are more pervasive since the basic-course small class reaches all students . It is therefore peculiarly important to give some play to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide these advantages in elementary courses ( first-year courses in contracts and torts , for example ) by employing enough faculty to provide every student with one or more small-group classes . The learning effect beyond communication of information is almost certainly different in a class of 30 than in a class of 150 . The psychological effect of learning in a group which is small enough to invite collaboration is one of the principal reasons law schools try to provide small classes . Classes of more than 50 students tend to be taught with impersonal methods ( lecture , largely ) and relatively structured syllabi . <p> ( 4 ) Effect on Student/Faculty Contact . The dominant model in law teaching is an academic model . The model of the academy assures personal contact between teachers and students . Standards 401-405 contemplate that a full-time teacher on a law faculty be able to spend time with each of his students in each of his courses . Heavy student-hour loads , and assignments which make significant student-teacher consultation difficult , tend to a law school climate in which only the occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of personal conference with his teachers . <p> ( 5 ) Effect on Scholarship and Public Service . The presupposition in legal education is that a teacher needs time to think , to write , and to serve the community . Law schools provide time for these necessary activities by observing limits on ( i ) the number of weeks a year in which a teacher teaches ; ( ii ) the number of students in each teacher 's courses ; and ( iii ) each teachers ' course-hour load . Scholarship in non-legal areas is particularly important in a school which does not have a university affiliation ( Standard 208210 ) now Standard 208 . <p> ( 6 ) Effect on Improvement in Teaching . A teacher should have time to think about teaching , prepare teaching materials ( or , at least , reorganize the syllabus for someone else 's materials ) , and devise , carry out , and monitor experiments in the way he or she teaches . One benefit of a favorable student/faculty ratio is that a teacher has time for this sort of thing because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or because three months are available to work on courses in the summer , or because the law school occasionally allows a light teaching load . Improvement in teaching is in part a function of numbers . Interest in improvement is in part a function of teaching temporarily in a novel field . A sound law school program assures teachers the space and encouragement for this sort of improvement . <p> ( 7 ) Effect on Governance . Inquiries about the size of the full-time faculty should determine whether there is enough personnel for the required faculty participation in the governance of the law school ( Standard 403 ) Faculty participation in law school governance is now explicitly addressed in ( Standards 206 , 402 &; 404 . All law school programs should be constantly open to re-evaluation by faculties . Full-time faculty , especially , must have personal resources for study and planning . <p> ( 8 ) Effect on Examinations . Most law school programs tend to depend on stiff , end-of-course examinations . An inquiry into the adequate of the size of a full-time faculty should consider that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a three-hour course . This burden may become so great that a teacher is not likely to have to reorganize , redraft , and , most importantly , re-think what is done in the preparation of an examination . An unreasonable grading burden on teachers is certain to accelerate entropy in the examination process . Teachers who are inquired to spend an unreasonable amount of time in grading can not fail to reduce the attention they pay to teaching and scholarship . <p> On the basis of the foregoing , the Accreditation Committee has concluded that the relationship of the size of the full-time law faculty to the size of the full-time and full-time-equivalent student body of the school has a major effect , in the context of the other factors , upon the establishment and maintenance of a program consistent with sound educational policies ( Standard 1013 ) and therefore upon compliance with Standards 201 and 401-405 . <p> Note : All overstruck text on the document are enclosed in curly brackets ( ) . <p>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
