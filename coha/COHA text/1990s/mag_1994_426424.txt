<p> Debbie is 17 , and like most teenagers , attends school  --  but her school is unusual . Each morning Debbie takes her baby , Jessica , to a special Head Start program before she goes to her own school . Debbie is one of the fortunate young mothers to be involved with the Crosswalk School and the special Head Start Program for children age birth to 3 in Spokane , Washington . <p> Debbie 's life has not been easy . She left her abusive home when she was only 15 , wanting to go as far away from her stepfather as possible . At 15 her options were few . The street was scary , but Debbie learned about Crosswalk from other friends . Crosswalk was helpful to Debbie , providing free meals , school , adults she learned to trust , and a place to " hang out . " Debbie could stay overnight at Crosswalk when it was cold and she did n't have anywhere else to go . " I do n't know what I 'd have done without Crosswalk , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is a year older . Mike also has a violent family . Mike sells drags to make money . He also uses drugs . <p> Last year when Debbie discovered she was pregnant , she was frightened but also glad . It would be good to have a baby to love , and someone who would love her . She stopped using drugs altogether , which was n't difficult because she had never been a heavy drug user . <p> Debbie moved into Alexandria 's House , a transitional home for young mothers , operated by Crosswalk . Alexandria 's House provides a refuge for six teenaged mothers and their children . The house-parent and social worker help Debbie take care of her baby , Jessica . <p> " The staff is so helpful with everything , " Debbie says . " You can really rely on them . " <p> Debbie pays $250 of her $440 monthly welfare check for rent , and she sets aside an additional $50 per month in the home 's savings program . This money will be returned to her when she leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's House , but Debbie is still lonely and depressed . Taking care of Jessica requires more energy and time than she expected . " Life as a young teen mom is hard , " she reflects . <p> Debbie 's relationship with her own mother has improved since Jessica 's birth . The child is the first grandchild and her mother likes to buy things and babysit with Jessica . Debbie notes , " Mom and I used to fight all the time . Now I can better understand what it means to be a parent . " <p> Mike likes to have a baby , but he ca n't offer much financial assistance and he gets angry when Debbie ca n't party with him . " We used to party together , but now I want him to help with Jessica instead of hanging out with friends , " says Debbie . <p> Debbie completed her freshman year of high school before leaving home . She is now attending Crosswalk 's alternative school . Crosswalk shares the building with a special Head Start program . " I probably would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program , " Debbie points out . " I want to have Jessica close by . " Young Street Mothers <p> Debbie is typical of many of the young mothers served at Crosswalk . Teenaged mothers who have " street life " experience are proud and devoted mothers , but they have many problems and a highly stressful life . They face difficulties related to a lack of money , concerns about their relationships with the baby 's father and their own parents , health issues , depression , and uncertainties about their own and their children 's futures . <p> We are using the term " street kid " to denote those children who identify with the street ; that is , they spend their time on the street rather than at school or with their families . Some are still marginally attached to their families . Street kids generally have complicated personal histories . Often their own families are violent and abusive and many street children have been in and out of numerous foster homes . Many have been neglected or physically , emotionally , and/ or sexually abused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in illegal activities . Their school experiences are often disrupted . These children have fallen through the cracks of social service agencies and are the failures of a society that is not supportive of child rearing . <p> Street girls represent an even more serious profile than boys , according to intake records at Crosswalk . Girls more frequently report sexual , physical and emotional abuse , express higher rates of depression , and experience more suicide attempts than boys . Pregnant or mothering girls indicate even higher rates of abuse , suicide attempts , depression , family conflict and drug use than other girls . <p> One-half of the girls were pregnant or mothering two years after intake at Crosswalk , according to a follow-up survey . Infants born to adolescents are apt to be fragile at birth and are at risk for neglect and abuse , and young street mothers are at even higher risk because of street life , drug use , inadequate nutrition , sexually transmitted diseases , and lack of medical care . These young mothers often have few child care skills , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of the Spokane young mothers concluded that these women are proud and devoted mothers , but are feeling the stresses of trying to raise a child at a young age , with limited income and social supports . The needs of these young women are many , including : housing , financial aid , social , educational , child care , mental health , medical , recreational , and emergency services . <p> These young women often face difficulty in acquiring needed resources because of restrictive rental , employment and agency policies related to age . Accessing resources is further complicated because the young mothers are often socially isolated , alienated and unable to trust . <p> These young mothers need a comprehensive , coordinated array of services to empower them to best raise their children and improve their own situations . Providing social services to street youth , including young mothers , requires a nontraditional approach . Services must be " voluntary , free , immediately accessible and on site . " Crosswalk Background <p> Volunteers of America 's Crosswalk , is Spokane , Washington 's response for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of community concern when a Mayor 's Task Force  --  comprised of members from child welfare agencies , law enforcement , juvenile court , and community service groups  --  identified a significant number of street kids and a lack of adequate services . Volunteers of America opened the doors of Crosswalk in 1985 , offering food , " on-the-spot " counseling , and a place for the children to " hang out . " Church groups provide meals 365 days a year , and clothing and personal items are available . An array of counseling services , including individual counseling , drug therapy groups , employment readiness groups , and family counseling , are available . Other private and public organizations offer on-site services or accept referral for medical care , employment , vocational training , and substance abuse treatment . Recreational activities , ranging from cake decorating , tie-dyeing , and ballet , to swimming , baseball , volleyball , and field trips , are offered by Crosswalk . <p> The needs of the young clients have dictated the program 's expansion . During the second year of the program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Crosswalk began providing shelter for 15 adolescents during the winter months . The plight of the young mothers was the driving force for developing transitional homes and apartments . The transitional home ( Alexandria 's House ) is designed to provide a supportive supervised living situation for mothers under the age of 18 and their children . The less structured apartments ( Apartments for Young Families ) provide homes for young mothers 18 to 21 , their children , and husbands , if these mothers are married . <p> Crosswalk moved into its present home in 1992 . The spacious building offered the opportunity for another agency to be housed in the same building . The special Head Start program was funded in 1993 . This situation allows the young mothers to attend school and be involved with their young children too . School for Moms <p> The alternative school at Crosswalk provides the street kids an opportunity to pursue and complete their educations . The staff soon learned that the school was an attraction to the kids : It was the school , not lunch , which brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the past eight years and hundreds have returned to neighborhood schools or have earned either their GEDs or diplomas through Crosswalk . <p> The success of the school is largely due to the choice of its certified teacher , an unusual , gentle man who has empathy and understanding for street kids . The school is flexible , allowing the youths to work at their own level and pace . The curriculum is pragmatic and realistic , focusing on problems and issues facing these children . Ken , the teacher , states that , " Kids like school when it has meaning for them . " <p> In a recent survey , two-thirds of the school attendees stated that their courses were providing them with useful skills for the future . More than three-fourths of the street children agreed that the Crosswalk School made them feel better about themselves . <p> Since it is located in Crosswalk , the school allows the young mothers easy access to other services . Counseling , clothing , financial assistance and referrals are readily available and delivered in non-traditional ways . The staff has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the past director , states that , " Young mothers do n't come with only one problem . You have to impact them from all directions . " Schools for Babies <p> The program for the children does not look like a typical Head Start Program . The children enrolled are infants and toddlers and their mothers have had street life experience or serious substance abuse problems . The school serves 24 children from three months to three years in two daily sessions . <p> The Head Start teachers and staff volunteered for this assignment and admit it 's a very different program from other Head Start classrooms . " You need tons of flexibility to work with these mothers and babies , " says Mary , the lead teacher . This means fewer " formal " presentations and more on-the-spot , spontaneous , two-minute trainings . <p> The roles of the health advocate and social worker are unique to the program . They spend most of their time in the classroom trying to connect with the parents and babies . In other programs , social workers conduct home visits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health advocate also visit . This allows all staff to see the home environment and the young mothers feel that " they all care for me . " <p> The staff-especially Crosswalk counselors , the Crosswalk teacher and public health nurses  --  work closely with other professionals to tackle the many needs of the teen mothers . These relationships , plus the physical presence at Crosswalk , help the staff to understand the complicated problems of the teen moms and to find successful interventions and solutions . <p> Rules are more lenient at the Cross-walk Head Start . Head Start 's strict attendance policies are relaxed because the staff understands the chaotic nature of the street girls ' lives . Transportation , drugs , intermittent boyfriends , childhood traumas , health problems and the moms ' ages are taken into account . <p> Although the Crosswalk Head Start program has been modified to meet the young mothers ' needs , the basic components are the same as other Head Starts , including parent involvement , developmentally appropriate education , health , social services , and nutrition . <p> The young mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " It 's a wonderful place , " says Debbie . " It 's easy to come up and talk with staff . They make you feel comfortable . " The mother of a two-year-old comments , " My baby is learning to say words and play with other kids . Another teen mother believes that the program " helps you more on the next stage in life . " Conclusions <p> Young street mothers have multiple needs . Cooperative , non-traditional schooling for young mothers and their babies provides an opportunity to give them comprehensive services . Offering diversified services is the ideal approach <p> The best plan for Spokane 's young street mothers and their children enables the mothers to attend the Crosswalk School , the babies to be enrolled in the <p> Crosswalk Head Start program , and the family to live in the transitional housing . Then mothers and children can be surrounded by caring adults who can gently guide , counsel , educate and be aware of danger signs in the course of the family 's growth and development . As Debbie points out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to be a parent . "
