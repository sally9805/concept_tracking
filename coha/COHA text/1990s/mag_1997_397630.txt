Texans and other Southwesterners do n't have to fly to Florida for a cruise . The Norwegian Star now sails from Houston . // For hundreds of Texans today , this Caribbean cruise from Houston begins in the seat of a car . Keith and Dolores Ferguson from Austin drive over , while honeymooners Terry and Jill Wright zip across town from Spring , Texas . They park their cars at the Port of Houston , and by 5 p.m. , the Norwegian Star sets sail east and south into the blue " Texaribbean . " It 's another journey for the Norwegian Cruise Line ship that takes mainly Southwesterners on weeklong cruises in the western waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean . As we board at a port so close to home , it feels like we 're beginning the cruise a day early , already stretching out on deck chairs instead of spending hours in the air flying to Florida . Photograph Photograph ( Left ) It 's cruising with a country beat when guests learn line dancing . Kids get wrapped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We depart with blasts of the horn and long curls of streamers . Several effervescent crew members , dressed in shirts with bands of red , white , and blue like the Texas flag , teach us how to dance the " Texarena . " But slowly , Texas loses its grasp as the engines shiver beneath us . Two hours later and past Galveston Bay , we turn starboard and sail south at 16 knots , heading toward the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico . And now it seems like any other cruise . Some go exploring fore and aft , ranging up and down stairs and elevators , piecing together the jigsaw puzzle of the nine decks . Down on deck three , a movie theater plays first-run films . Up on deck nine , in the Top of the Star Bar , some settle back with tequila and cigars . Elsewhere there 's a health club , spa , small casino , and the Stardust Lounge for live entertainment . We 're aboard what was once one of the largest cruise ships . With a passenger capacity of 800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry that now sees ships that carry more than 2,600 people . With its muted colors and modest appointments , it 's not as swanky as the Holland America ships nor as vivacious as Carnival Cruise Lines vessels . Our ship 's cabins expand in size with the higher decks . Mine is on deck seven , with two twin beds , television ( CNN and movies ) , telephone ( calls to land are expensive ) , and a daybed beside a windowa tempting nest for reading and watching the passing parade on the deck outside . But the sun tempts even more guests to gather around the pool deck above the wide , white swath of the wake . Terry and Jill already are stretched out in the sun , grateful for a cruise that 's just a short drive away . " This is a big seller once you take out the airfare , " Terry says . " It takes time to get to Florida . Timethat 's what nobody has anymore . This is really convenient . We spent two days of our honeymoon in Galveston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on out . " Jill , Dolores , and fellow passengers Bobby and Jacqui Moszeeall first-time cruisers-could n't have picked a better ship for beginners . The Norwegian Star is relaxed and family oriented and does n't stand too much on ceremony or formality . On the two formal dining nights the women sparkle in black and white , while most men choose dark suits or sport coats .

If someone brings up places like Paris and Athens , they 're probably referring to the towns in Texas . It 's a solid , middle-class crowd of all ages , people with whom Jill Rogers feels right at home . A native of Enid , Oklahoma , she was chosen as cruise director because the line wanted someone with an energetic personality to kick off the cruise experience . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a laugh . " They knew with all these Texans and Oklahomans , I 'd get along just fine . " Jill has arranged a fifties night , a sixties night , and Big Band music for passengers . A supervised children 's program keeps kids busy , while adults practice their golf swing , play one-on-one in basketball , or shoot skeet . You can learn line dancing , browse duty-free shops , and attend an art auction with ridiculously low prices . And of course , you go ashore . On through the week , the ship calls at Calica/Cancun , then Cozumel , and Roatan ( just north of the coast of Honduras ) , where passengers take tenders to shore for shopping , golf , snorkeling , scuba diving , and excursions to Mayan ruins that rise from steamy jungles . But I think the best parts of the cruise are at sea , where tans darken , new friendships deepen , and days lengthen with so much freedom of time . It 's a serene seven days , where most aboard , young and old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little snooze time . " It met our expectations and then some , although our cabin on deck three was a little smaller than we expected , " Jacqui Moszee would say later . " But I miss it . I 'm ready to do it again . " " We were pretty positive about everything , " Keith recalled . " Dolores had a great time . Mainly we took the cruise just to relax . " If you go , you may find the star shines brightest in Le Bistro , a small , intimate niche . It 's a great place to escape the assigned tables in Seven Continents and enjoy quiet dinners for two . There is also afternoon tea with jams and scones and marble cake , all set to live violin music . There , Texas seems a sea away .
