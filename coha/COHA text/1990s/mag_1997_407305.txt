YOUR TURN Where Are the Breastrooms , Please ? Sometimes it takes a child 's innocence to open our eyes By Debbie Williams I made the choice to breastfeed even before I knew I was pregnant . As a nurse , I knew all the benefits of this built - in feeding system  --  optimum nutrition , transferred immune protection , economical , sanitary and portable . Wherever I went , the milk was always with me , always at the right temperature , no fussing with bottles and mixing formula , no worries about sterilization . Other than the initial engorgement ( I could n't believe these breasts were mine ! ) , mildly cracked nipples and unexpected stains on my blouses , there were few problems . The only real discomfort I encountered was my first experience nursing my baby in public . Following the birth of my son , Nicholas , I was comfortable nursing around my family and friends . ( I do n't think my father was as comfortable as I was , because as soon as I started undoing the flaps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window or go to the bathroom . ) However , the first real outing we had after our baby was born was an invitation to a Sunday brunch at a restaurant with acquaintances of my husband . Nicholas , of course , accompanied us . All was well for about half an hour . Then a previously angelic Nicholas let out a piercing cry  --  when this child said it was chow time , it was chow time . Everyone looked at me and , in their infinite wisdom , informed me that they thought the baby was hungry . Mild panic ran through my head . What do I do ? Should I discreetly undo my bra and put the baby to my breast ? For some reason I felt very uncomfortable at this table of strangers . How would they react ? Would they be offended ? Several seconds passed before I heard a familiar voice coming from my mouth , asking the present company to excuse me . I asked the waitress for directions to the ladies ' room . As I pushed open the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only option was one of two toilets , each tucked into a tiny stall . I had no choice but to lean against the sink counter to nurse my wailing child . As soon as Nicholas latched onto my breast and started nursing vigorously , the door opened and in walked the sweetest little girl , who appeared to be about five years old . With a look of curiosity she asked how old my baby was . " He 's three weeks old today , " I said . Then with a quizzical expression on her face , she asked , " What are you doing ? " Feeding my baby , " I replied . With that response , she tilted her head , wrinkled up her nose and asked , " Why does your baby have to eat in the bathroom ? " I felt as if someone had thrown a bucket of ice water in my face . I was so ashamed that it took the innocence of this beautiful little girl to open my eyes . Who else would want to eat in the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished his lunch , never again to see the inside of a public washroom at mealtime  --  unless , of course , it was to change his diaper . We are still emerging from a bottle - fed society , but great strides have been made within the last few years . More and more restaurants and stores are offering mothers ' rooms . Unfortunately , some people still think it is disgusting that a mother would reveal her breast in a public place , though for some reason it is OK if a woman in a magazine ad exposes herself . Breast - feeding in public can be awkward and uncomfortable for some moms , especially the first few times . But you can learn discreet methods ( like draping a light blanket over your chest ) of nursing without revealing your breasts at all . It just takes practice  --  and with a new - born you 'll get plenty of that ! Debbie Williams is a mother of three and a part - time nurse in Vancouver .
