It was clear to anyone listening to the Mount Everest radio traffic that Rob Hall had decided to die . For Hall , there seemed to be little drama in the decision  --  but for someone in his position , there rarely is . In the brutal cold and almost oxygen-free air found at Everest altitudes , a sort of woozy resignation sets in . Decisions to climb or descend , rest or trudge on , get made with a fatalistic shrug . At the moment , Hall was shrugging toward death . <P> David Breashears and Ed Viesturs were in radio contact with Hall as he made his decision . Filmmakers and climbers who had known the famous guide for years , they were 8,000 ft. below him , in the relative safety of a mountainside campsite . Hall , on the other hand , was 400 ft. shy of Everest 's 29,028-ft. summit  --  the highest peak in the world  --  stuck on an outcrop where he had spent the night after a sudden blizzard pounded the mountain . The situation was probably not survivable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live through it . " Think about Thailand , " Viesturs said . " Once you come down , we 'll tour the beaches and finally see those skinny legs of yours out of a snowsuit . " <P> Hall laughed weakly , but did n't stir . Quickly , someone in camp patched a satellite call to New Zealand , where Hall 's wife , pregnant with their first child , was waiting . " I 'm looking forward to making you completely better when you come home , " she called to her husband when the connection was made . On top of his mountain , Hall may have smiled . " I love you , " he said . " Sleep well , my sweetheart . Please do n't worry too much . " No one ever heard from Rob Hall again . <P> It was May 11 , 1996 , when Hall spoke his last , and he was not the only one the mountain claimed that day . Just 36 hours earlier , 33 people had set out for Everest 's peak . When the storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that disaster , one of the worst in climbing history , became the subject of magazine articles , television specials and a growing collection of books , notably the best seller Into Thin Air , by journalist Jon Krakauer , who was a survivor of the murderous climb . <P> But part of the story has never been told . Breashears and Viesturs were on the mountain that week to try something never before attempted : to capture the ascent to Everest 's summit in the highest-quality movie film available , the dizzyingly realistic 65-mm IMAX format . Resting at their campsite in preparation for the grueling mountaintop filming , they became unintended participants in the tragedy , as well as unexpected heroes . Their film , which tells the story of Everest and the drama that unfolded on it , will premiere next spring . This week they offer an advance look at it as the book Everest : Mountain Without Mercy ( National Geographic Society , $35 ) , authored by outdoors writer Broughton Coburn and filled with IMAX images , appears in stores .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
