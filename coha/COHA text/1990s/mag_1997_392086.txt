Harlem , 1934 . The Black community is hit hard amidst the Great Depression of the 1930s . But there is at least one hope to cling to-the numbers game , where a penny can buy a dream of a big payoff . The pennies add up to tens of thousands of dollars a day , a profit held by Madame Stephanie St. Clair , the " Queen " of Harlem 's Black community . However , greedy White mobsters can not resist trying to steal the profitable Harlem numbers base . The intriguing , historical controversy sets the stage for United Artists Pictures ' Hoodlum , which stars Academy Award-nominee Laurence Fishburne and the talented actress and singer Vanessa L. Williams . Fishburne plays the infamous Ellsworth Bumpy " Johnson , the intelligent outlaw who defies mobsters Dutch Schultz ( played by Tim Roth ) and Salvatore " Lucky " Luciano ( played by Andy Garcia ) to help the imprisoned Queen keep a reign on her profitable business .

" No one ever talks about Blacks ' contributions in the underworld ... that 's why I was attracted to it .... The story is basically about a real person who lived in the community-a nontraditional hero . He exploited on one level , but always gave back . People still love him . " He also points out that while it explores a portion of Blacks ' role in the underworld , it offers more . " It 's not a Black film ; it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very important time in history . It 's about losing your way and finding yourself , values and people . ( It 's about ) a real person who is a real character in history , " says Duke . " Some may object , but if they look at American history closely , most people we find to be icons , their pasts are sordid . I 'm not ashamed to say a guy in the underworld was a hero . Fm very proud to be a part of developing his story .... I always wanted to do a gangster movie . This shows consequences of taking lives and what that means , " Duke notes .
