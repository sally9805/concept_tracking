A guide for getting your family through the season of sniffles BY SUE WALLACE , R.N. // REMEMBER LAST WINTER ? Your son caught that nasty cold . He passed it to his baby sister , who promptly gave it to you . Soon everyone in the houseexcept maybe the dog-was sniffling , achy , and miserable . While we may have moved closer to a cure for the common cold , we 're not there yet . " In clinical trials some antiviral medications have proven successful at stopping cold viruses from replicating , but they also cause serious side effects , such as nasal bleeding , " says Dennis Murray , M.D. , a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Michigan State University . For now , the following are the best treatments to lessen cold symptoms and speed recovery when the sneezing starts in your house . HOME REMEDIES Your options depend on the age of the sniffler . Although acetaminophen can be given to infants as young as 3 months , most over-the-counter medicines are n't meant for babies . Says Murray Katcher , M.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Wisconsin Medical School , " The risk of adverse reactions-such as irritability or drowsiness-is too high . " Fortunately , some old-fashioned , nonmedicinal methods of easing discomfort may provide help for all ages . Because newborns are highly dependent on the nose to breathe , it 's important to keep the nasal passage clear of mucus at all times . ( The ability to breathe well through the mouth develops after 3 or 4 months . ) To relieve a baby 's nasal congestion before feedings and bedtime , Dr. Katcher recommends using a medicine dropper to place a few drops of salt water in each nostril , then suctioning the nose with a bulb syringe . To make solution : Dissolve 1/4 teaspoon of salt in 1 cup water . You can also buy saline nose drops in the drugstore-just make sure that the label says the product contains saline with no active ingredients . Parents of infants under 3 months should always consult a doctor even for minor cold symptoms . Running a hot shower and breathing in steam is another way to temporarily clear congestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cool-mist humidifiers are safer than hot-water vaporizers , which can cause serious scalds or burns if tipped over . Disinfect the machines with vinegar or soap and water every day before using , to avoid mold and bacteria growth . For sore-throat sufferers over 4 , George Kirkpatrick , M.D. , associate professor of family medicine at the University of South Alabama , recommends ice chips . The coldness temporarily numbs a sore throat , and fluids can help prevent the dehydration that can accompany a fever , which may occur during the cold 's onset . ( Most cold-related fevers are slight , but if the fever persists more than a few days , contact a doctor . ) Gargling with warm salt water-about 1/2 teaspoon of salt per glass-also soothes the throat ; however , it 's difficult for very young children to master this skill . To suppress a cough , Frank Witter , M.D. , an obstetrical clinical pharmacologist and associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University Medical Center , suggests this homemade syrup : 1 tablespoon of lemon juice mixed with 1 tablespoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lemon makes it more palatable . ( Do n't give honey to babies under 1 year old . ) TLC WITH OTC Always check with your doctor before administering more than one drug a day , such as a cough syrup with a pain reliever . And do n't even think about using an antibiotic , since a cold is a viral , not bacterial , infection , and antibiotics wo n't speed a recovery or ease symptoms . ( A recent national survey found that 80 percent of Americans who fail to finish their antibiotic prescription use what 's left over to treat a future cold or flu . ) To relieve discomfort : // Decongestants Phenylpropanolamine , pseudoephedrine , and phenylephrine are three effective ingredients in over-the-counter drugs for clearing up stuffy noses . Pseudoephedrine , a common ingredient in medicines like Sudafed , is safe for some pregnant women to take , but check with your doctor first . However , none have been tested on kids under age 2 , and the drugs occasionally cause hyperactivity in children . They can also raise blood pressure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprays , can also clear up a stuffed-up head , but using them for more than a few days may cause what doctors call " rebound congestion , " meaning that when you stop taking them , you 'll end up more congested than when you started . Cough suppressants Because coughing is the body 's natural way to get rid of mucus , try to avoid using suppressants or giving them to your child . To get some sleep at night , or to relieve a dry , hacking cough , use a medication with dextromethorphan , which subdues the cough reflex . If you have a sore throat too , you 'll want a topical anesthetic spray . Look for one containing phenol or benzocaine . Keep all throat sprays away from children , though , since anesthetics desensitize the throat and could lead to choking . * Pain relievers Not all colds cause achiness . But if the virus enters the bloodstream it can trigger the central nervous system to fight the cold , which can result in chills and aches . Pain relievers ease the discomfort and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your child medicine containing ibuprofen or acetaminophen ( okay for pregnant women ) but not aspirin , which has been linked in children to Reye 's syndrome , a potentially fatal disorder . * Lozenges The same topical anesthetics in sprays are available as lozenges . They numb the throat , so avoid giving them to kids . Nonmedicated lozenges can temporarily moisten a dry , sore throat by stimulating saliva production . Since they soothe for only about 15 minutes , reserve them for mealtime and bedtime to make it easier to eat and sleep . Never give lozenges to children under 4 , since they can be a choking hazard . Have kids over 4 sit , not lie down or run around , until the lozenge dissolves . ALL-NATURAL TREATMENTS Alternative therapies may help treat a variety of illnesses , including colds . " Zinc lozenges available in drugstores , for example , may decrease symptoms and the duration of a viral infection if used during the cold 's onset , " says Brian Bouch , M.D. , a holistic physician in Petaluma , CA . He recommends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 and above . Children 4 to 7 should take half a lozenge . Skip them for those under age 4 . Although some studies suggest that vitamin C might help decrease the duration of a cold , further studies are needed , says Sheldon Spector , M.D. , clinical professor of medicine at UCLA , who recommends taking no more than 1,000 mg a day . Alternative practitioners , however , swear by more aggressive doses . Dr. Bouch , for example , recommends 3,000 to 5,000 mg of vitamin C daily for adults and children over 12 . Younger children can take half that amount , which is best given in powder form or as a chewable tablet . Herbs , such as echinacea ( available in tablet form or drops ) , may also help prevent colds by stimulating the immune system . Try mixing a few drops with a little sugar , suggests Ruth Gingerich , a pediatric nurse practitioner in Carmel , CA . " But avoid taking it longer than ten days , at which point the body may become immune to the benefits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it may be linked to birth defects , so women of childbearing age should never take it . Finally , do n't discount the power of Grandma 's favorite-chicken soup . Medical studies suggest that it temporarily reduces airway inflamma- tion . " The heat loosens up the mucus so you can cough it up ; the liquid helps prevent dehydration ; and it 's rich in protein , vitamins , and minerals , " says Margaret Gradison , M.D. , of the department of community and family medicine at Duke University . As you and your family slur and sip your way to health , remember to drink plenty of fluids . Children can drink diluted juice and adults should drink at least eight glasses of water a day . Eat a balanced diet and limit dairy products ( which can coat the throat and be uncomfortable ) as well as caffeine ( which worsens dehydration ) . Above all , rest or at least try to take it easy . // the cold FACTS Author Affiliation SUE WALLACE , R.N. , has two kids and lives in Tucson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
