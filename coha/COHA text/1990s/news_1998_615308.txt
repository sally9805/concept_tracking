<p> Excerpts from the report sent to Congress by Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr : ( Part 1 of 9 ) Introduction . . . The Office of the Independent Counsel ( " OIC " or " Office " ) hereby submits substantial and credible information that President William Jefferson Clinton committed acts that may constitute grounds for an impeachment . . . . The information reveals that President Clinton : &gt; lied under oath at a civil deposition while he was a defendant in a sexual harassment lawsuit ; &gt; lied under oath to a grand jury ; &gt; attempted to influence the testimony of a potential witness who had direct knowledge of facts that would reveal the falsity of his deposition testimony ; &gt; attempted to obstruct justice by facilitating a witness 's plan to refuse to comply with a subpoena ; &gt; attempted to obstruct justice by encouraging a witness to file an affidavit that the President knew would be false , and then by making use of that false affidavit at his own deposition ; &gt; lied to potential grand jury witnesses , knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and &gt; engaged in a pattern of conduct that was inconsistent with his constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws . . . . One sharply disputed issue in the ( Paula Corbin ) Jones litigation was the extent to which the president would be required to disclose information about sexual relationships he may have had with " other women . " . . . . . . In an order dated Dec. 11 , 1997 , for example , ( United States District Judge Susan ) Wright said : " The court finds , therefore , that the plaintiff is entitled to information regarding any individuals with whom the president had sexual relations or proposed or sought to have sexual relations and who were during the relevant time frame state or federal employees . " ... When asked to identify all women who were state or federal employees and with whom he had had " sexual relations " since 1986 , the president answered under oath : " None . " . . . . . . Under oath and in the presence of Judge Wright , the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a " sexual relationship , " or " sexual relations " with Monica Lewinsky . The President also stated that he had no specific memory of having been alone with Ms. Lewinsky , that he remembered few details of any gifts they might have exchanged , and indicated that no one except his attorneys had kept him informed of Ms. Lewinsky 's status as a potential witness in the Jones case . The investigation On Jan. 12 , 1998 , this office received information that Monica Lewinsky was attempting to influence the testimony of one of the witnesses in the Jones litigation , and that Ms. Lewinsky herself was prepared to provide false information under oath in that lawsuit . . . . After gathering preliminary evidence to test the information 's reliability , the OIC presented the evidence to Attorney General Janet Reno . . . . On the following day , Attorney General Reno petitioned the Special Division of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , on an expedited basis , to expand the jurisdiction of independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the allegations about the President 's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky became public , the OIC filed a motion for limited intervention and a stay of discovery in Jones v. Clinton . The OIC argued that the civil discovery process should be halted because it was having a negative effect on the criminal investigation . The OIC represented to the court that numerous individuals then under subpoena in Jones , including Monica Lewinsky , were integral to the OIC 's investigation , and that courts routinely stayed discovery in such circumstances . The next day Judge Wright responded to the OIC 's motion . The court ruled that discovery would be permitted to continue , except to the extent that it sought information about Monica Lewinsky . The court acknowledged that " evidence concerning Monica Lewinsky might be relevant to the issues in the Jones case . " It concluded , however , that this evidence was not " essential to the core issues in this case , " and that some of that evidence " might even be inadmissible . " The court found that the potential value of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case in continuing to seek discovery about Ms. Lewinsky . The court also was concerned that the OIC 's investigation " could be impaired and prejudiced were the Court to permit inquiry into the Lewinsky matter by the parties in this civil case . " On March 9 , 1998 , Judge Wright denied Ms. Jones 's motion for reconsideration of the decision regarding Monica Lewinsky . The order states : The court readily acknowledges that evidence of the Lewinsky matter might have been relevant to plaintiff 's case and , as she argues , that such evidence might possibly have helped her establish , among other things , intent , absence of mistake , motive , and habit on the part of the President . . . . Nevertheless , whatever relevance such evidence may otherwise have . . . it simply is not essential to the core issues in this case . . . . On April 1 , 1998 , Judge Wright granted President Clinton 's motion for summary judgment , concluding that even if the facts alleged by Paula Jones were true , her claims failed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal , and as of the date of this Referral , the matter remains under consideration by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit . After the dismissal of Ms. Jones 's lawsuit , the criminal investigation continued . It was ( and is ) the view of this office that any attempt to obstruct the proper functioning of the judicial system , regardless of the perceived merits of the underlying case , is a serious matter that warrants further inquiry . After careful consideration of all the evidence , the OIC has concluded that the evidence of wrongdoing is substantial and credible , and that the wrongdoing is of sufficient gravity that it warrants referral to Congress . The significance of the evidence of wrongdoing <p> It is not the role of this office to determine whether the President 's actions warrant impeachment by the House and removal by the Senate ; those judgments are , of course , constitutionally entrusted to the legislative branch . This office is authorized , rather , to conduct criminal investigations and to seek criminal prosecutions for matters within its jurisdiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office also has a statutory duty to disclose to Congress information that " may constitute grounds for an impeachment , " a task that inevitably requires judgment about the seriousness of the acts revealed by the evidence . . . . . . . All Americans , including the president , are entitled to enjoy a private family life , free from public or governmental scrutiny . But the privacy concerns raised in this case are subject to limits , three of which we briefly set forth here . First . The first limit was imposed when the president was sued in federal court for alleged sexual harassment . The evidence in such litigation is often personal . At times , that evidence is highly embarrassing for both plaintiff and defendant . . . . Congress and the Supreme Court have concluded that embarrassment-related concerns must give way to the greater interest in allowing aggrieved parties to pursue their claims . . . . To excuse a party who lied or concealed evidence on the ground that the evidence covered only " personal " or " private " behavior would frustrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve in enacting and interpreting the nation 's sexual harassment laws . That is particularly true when the conduct that is being concealed - sexual relations in the workplace between a high official and a young subordinate employee - itself conflicts with those goals . Second . The second limit was imposed when Judge Wright required disclosure of the precise information that is in part the subject of this Referral . . . . The fact that Judge Wright later determined that the evidence would not be admissible at trial , and still later granted judgment in the President 's favor , does not change the President 's legal duty at the time he testified . . . . Perjury and attempts to obstruct the gathering of evidence can never be an acceptable response to a court order , regardless of the eventual course or outcome of the litigation . . . . Perjured testimony is an obvious and flagrant affront to the basic concepts of judicial proceedings . Effective restraints against this type of egregious offense are therefore imperative . <p> Third . The third limit is unique to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than an executive responsibility . It is the inspiring symbol of all that is highest in American purpose and ideals . " When he took the Oath of Office in 1993 and again in 1997 , President Clinton swore that he would " faithfully execute the Office of President . " As the head of the Executive Branch , the President has the constitutional duty to " take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed . " The President gave his testimony in the Jones case under oath and in the presence of a federal judge , a member of a co-equal branch of government ; he then testified before a federal grand jury , a body of citizens who had themselves taken an oath to seek the truth . In view of the enormous trust and responsibility attendant to his high Office , the President has a manifest duty to ensure that his conduct at all times complies with the law of the land . In sum , perjury and acts that obstruct justice by any citizen - whether in a criminal case , a grand jury investigation , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - are profoundly serious matters . When such acts are committed by the President of the United States , we believe those acts " may constitute grounds for an impeachment . " The scope of the referral <p> 1 . Background of the investigation . The link between the OIC 's jurisdiction - as it existed at the end of 1997 - and the matters set forth in this Referral is complex but direct . In January 1998 , Linda Tripp , a witness in three ongoing OIC investigations , came forward with allegations that : ( i ) Monica Lewinsky was planning to commit perjury in Jones v. Clinton , and ( ii ) she had asked Ms. Tripp to do the same . Ms. Tripp also stated that : ( i ) Vernon Jordan had counseled Ms. Lewinsky and helped her obtain legal representation in the Jones case , and ( ii ) at the same time , Mr. Jordan was helping Ms. Lewinsky obtain employment in the private sector . OIC investigators and prosecutors recognized parallels between Mr. Jordan 's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and his earlier relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prior to January 1998 , the OIC possessed evidence that Vernon Jordan - along with other high-level associates of the President and First Lady - helped Mr. Hubbell obtain lucrative consulting contracts while he was a potential witness and/or subject in the OIC 's ongoing investigation . This assistance took place , moreover , while Mr. Hubbell was a target of a separate criminal investigation into his own conduct . The OIC also possessed evidence that the President and the First Lady knew and approved of the Hubbell-focused assistance . Specifically , in the wake of his April 1994 resignation from the Justice Department , Mr. Hubbell launched a private consulting practice in Washington , D.C. In the startup process , Mr. Hubbell received substantial aid from important public and private figures . On the day prior to Mr. Hubbell announcing his resignation , White House Chief of Staff Thomas " Mack " McLarty attended a meeting at the White House with the President , First Lady , and others , where Mr. Hubbell 's resignation was a topic of discussion . At some point after the White House meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance to Mr. Hubbell . Mr. Jordan introduced Mr. Hubbell to senior executives at New York-based MacAndrews &; Forbes Holding Co . Mr. Jordan is a director of Revlon , Inc. , a company controlled by MacAndrews &; Forbes . The introduction was successful ; MacAndrews &; Forbes retained Mr. Hubbell at a rate of $ 25,000 per quarter . Vernon Jordan informed President Clinton that he was helping Mr. Hubbell . By late 1997 , this Office was investigating whether a relationship existed between consulting payments to Mr. Hubbell and his lack of cooperation ( specifically , his incomplete testimony ) with the OIC 's investigation . In particular , the OIC was investigating whether Mr. Hubbell concealed information about certain core Arkansas matters , namely , the much-publicized Castle Grande real estate project and related legal work by the Rose Law Firm , including the First Lady . Against this background , the OIC considered the January 1998 allegations that : ( i ) Ms. Lewinsky was prepared to lie in order to benefit the President , and ( ii ) Vernon Jordan was assisting Ms. Lewinsky in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private-sector job with , among others , Revlon , Inc . Based in part on these similarities , the OIC undertook a preliminary investigation . On January 15 , 1998 , this Office informed the Justice Department of the results of our inquiry . The Attorney General immediately applied to the Special Division of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for an expansion of the OIC 's jurisdiction . The Special Division granted this request and authorized the OIC to determine whether Monica Lewinsky or others had violated federal law in connection with the Jones v. Clinton case . <p> Current status of the investigation . When the OIC 's jurisdiction was expanded to cover the Lewinsky matter in January 1998 , several matters remained under active investigation by this Office . Evidence was being gathered and evaluated on , among other things , events related to the Rose Law Firm 's representation of Madison Guaranty Savings &; Loan Association ; events related to the firings in the White House Travel Office ; and events related to the use of FBI files . Since the current phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewinsky matter have also come under scrutiny , including possible perjury and obstruction of justice related to former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey , and the possible misuse of the personnel records of Pentagon employee Linda Tripp . From the outset , it was our strong desire to complete all phases of the investigation before deciding whether to submit to Congress information - if any - that may constitute grounds for an impeachment . But events and the statutory command of Section 595(c) have dictated otherwise . As the investigation into the President 's actions with respect to Ms. Lewinsky and the Jones litigation progressed , it became apparent that there was a significant body of substantial and credible information that met the Section 595(c) threshold . As that phase of the investigation neared completion , it also became apparent that a delay of this Referral until the evidence from all phases of the investigation had been evaluated would be unwise . Although Section 595(c) does not specify when information must be submitted , its text strongly suggests that information of this type belongs in the hands of Congress as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and substantially complete . All phases of the investigation are now nearing completion . This Office will soon make final decisions about what steps to take , if any , with respect to the other information it has gathered . Those decisions will be made at the earliest practical time , consistent with our statutory and ethical obligations . The contents of the referral <p> The referral consists of several parts . Part One is a Narrative . . . A large part of the Narrative is devoted to a description of the President 's relationship with Monica Lewinsky . The nature of the relationship was the subject of many of the President 's false statements , and his desire to keep the relationship secret provides a motive for many of his actions that apparently were designed to obstruct justice . The Narrative is lengthy and detailed . It is the view of this Office that the details are crucial to an informed evaluation of the testimony , the credibility of witnesses , and the reliability of other evidence . Many of the details reveal highly personal information ; many are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential . The President 's defense to many of the allegations is based on a close parsing of the definitions that were used to describe his conduct . We have , after careful review , identified no manner of providing the information that reveals the falsity of the President 's statements other than to describe his conduct with precision . Part Two of the Referral is entitled " Information that May Constitute Grounds for An Impeachment . " This " Grounds " portion of the Referral summarizes the specific evidence that the President lied under oath and attempted to obstruct justice . . . . Several volumes accompany the Referral . The Appendix contains relevant court orders , tables , a discussion of legal and evidentiary issues , background information on the Jones litigation , a diagram of the Oval Office , and other reference material . We next set forth a series of " Document Supplements , " which attempt to provide some of the most important support material in an accessible format . Document Supplement A contains transcripts of the President 's deposition testimony and grand jury testimony ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interview statements . Document Supplements C , D , and E set forth the full text of the documents cited in the Referral . Although every effort has been made to provide full and accurate quotations of witnesses in their proper context , we urge review of the full transcripts of the testimony cited below . . . .
