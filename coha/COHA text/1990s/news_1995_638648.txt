<p> Mike Shanahan had it made in the shade of the Golden Gate Bridge . The San Francisco 49ers , simply the greatest organization since George Halas formed the NFL over a half-barrel in Canton , Ohio , had plans for him . Big plans . <p> Shanahan was going to succeed George Seifert and perpetuate the legacy launched by Bill Walsh . All he had to do was wait two years and the best coaching job in football was his for the taking . <p> Instead , he walked away . <p> To know what being the head coach of the Denver Broncos means to Shanahan , you have to know what he gave up to accept the job . Shanahan , several sources have confirmed , was offered the 49ers ' head-coaching job starting in 1997 . <p> The plan was all in place . Seifert would step down , ideally after winning another Super Bowl , and Shanahan would take his rightful place at the top of the Niners ' on-field football operation . <p> It was n't so much that Shanahan did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could have written his own ticket in St. Louis , Philadelphia and Seattle , but had no interest . The only phone call he returned was Pat Bowlen 's . <p> Leaving the 49ers for a .500 team ? And a .500 AFC team ? A team with the worst defense in the NFL , one that had fired two coaches in as many years ? That 's the one . That 's the team Shanahan could n't wait to inherit . <p> The obvious question : Why ? <p> " The 49ers job is one of the great jobs in all of sports , " said Shanahan . " Just by their organization , what they 've done , what they 've accomplished But I really felt going into a situation like the 49ers would have been taking over for somebody who has already set the plan and the tone for an organization that 's been very successful . <p> " Bill Walsh and George Seifert have done an unbelievable job in that organization . One of my goals and aspirations was to get an organization like the 49ers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they 've had over the last 15 years . " <p> In other words , he wanted a rebuilding project . But not just any rebuilding project . He could have had that in any number of places . He preferred the only NFL city with mountains and brown clouds overlooking the skyline . <p> " To me , that 's the bottom line on why we were able to hire him , " said Bowlen , the Broncos ' owner . " He wanted to come to Denver . I do n't think he would have taken any job but this one . It was n't like he did n't have a great job out there with a great team . " <p> Question is , how much longer can the 49ers ' joy ride last ? For all their mystique and mastery , things ca n't go on forever like they have since the early ' 80s . By the time Shanahan would have inherited the job , Steve Young , Jerry Rice and the rest of the team 's talent core would have been well into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where John Elway is n't getting any younger , either . For that matter , the Broncos ' entire team is one of the oldest in the league . And the Broncos do n't have any Super Bowl championships to show for all that experience , either . <p> Their age is a fallout from almost a decade of blown drafts . With no young talent from the draft , they 've had to patch up several positions with aging , big-money free agents . If Shanahan wanted a rebuilding project , he definitely came to the right place . <p> " If you take a look at what we 've done in the draft in the last seven or eight years , there 's nothing there , " said Shanahan . " Basically our football team is a number of free agents . You take a look at our starters With the exception of John and Shannon Sharpe , and Simon Fletcher and Steve Atwater on defense that 's it . <p> " As I look at it , it 's rebuilding . But every team goes through that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge . " <p> It 's not just rebuilding the roster . To Shanahan , it 's restoring a feeling and rekindling an emotional flame . Having coached in Denver twice before - during which time the Broncos made it to three Super Bowls - he knows what Denver is like when the Broncos are riding high . <p> " It 's a college atmosphere , " he said . " There are n't a lot of towns that get behind their football team like Denver does with the Broncos . I enjoy the town , and any time you can work in a town you thoroughly enjoy living in , it 's a huge advantage . " <p> Shanahan has lived in every region of the country except the East Coast during his coaching career . His stops have included Los Angeles , San Francisco , Denver , Gainesville , Fla. , Norman , Okla. , Minneapolis , Flagstaff , Ariz. , and Charleston . That 's Charleston , Ill. , not Charleston , S.C . <p> It took him almost 20 years , but he finally came to realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he got the chance to return , he took it . <p> " I 've lived in a number of towns , " he said . " I really know what a difference it is to live in a community that you actually enjoy , as compared to a town where you might enjoy the job , but you could take or leave the city . As a coach , you 're kind of living on borrowed time , but I do n't feel that way anymore . This feels like home . " <p> If Denver was the biggest factor in Shanahan 's decision to leave the 49ers , his relationship with Bowlen was a close second . How close are they ? Look no farther than Shanahan 's seven-year contract , one of the longest in league history for a player or coach . <p> In retrospect , Bowlen feels fortunate to have ensured Shanahan 's presence on the scene for seven years . Fact is , Shanahan could get an extension tomorrow if he asked for it . If all goes as planned , Shanahan never will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach . <p> " I consider Mike one of the brilliant coaching minds in the game today , " Bowlen said . " You look around the league at the young coaches out there . You look at Chicago and Pittsburgh Those guys are the next generation of coaches . They 're going to take the league into the next century . I wanted to make sure that we got the best young coach out there , and I 'm convinced that Mike is the guy . " <p> A lot of people have contributed to molding Shanahan 's coaching style . He 's even taken a few pages out of Dan Reeves ' personality playbook , especially the chapter titled " How To Motivate Players . " <p> Elway , for one , never had seen the hard edge Shanahan has shown in his first six months on the job . Things are different from the days when Shanahan was the Broncos offensive coordinator . <p> " In some ways , he and Dan are a lot alike , " Elway said . " He puts a lot of pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no question that pressure is a big part of this . The way he works is by putting pressure on guys - every player , every practice , every game . There 's no letup . <p> " I guess I expected this as far as his knowledge and those types of things . But he was never the pressure guy he is now . There 's a lot more pressure on people now than when Dan or Wade was here , or when Mike was an assistant coach . " <p> At practice , Shanahan always is looking over the players ' shoulders . He is n't offering suggestions , either . He 's demanding excellence . If his first preseason as the Broncos ' coach has shown anything , it 's that Shanahan is relentless in his pursuit of perfection . <p> " He wants it done perfectly , " said Elway . " Even if you make a play , if you do something wrong , you 're still going to hear about it . Whether it 's technique or the route was n't run right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether you make the play or not . " <p> Shanahan 's attention to detail borders on unbelievable . Coaches routinely ate their lunch on the run at Greeley . Why ? Because there were meetings to attend , video to break down , quality to control . The afternoon practices did n't end at 5 p.m. , but at 5:02 . <p> With Shanahan , every minute counts . It 's as if he 's making up for time he wasted during his first tenure as an NFL head coach . During his year-plus debacle with the Raiders , he learned a hard lesson in the importance of a coach being able to control his own destiny . <p> " I do n't really know what happened there , but it had to change him , " said Bowlen . " He never had a chance . Knowing Al Davis like I do , he was n't going to let anyone come in there and run things . But Mike was young at the time . He had to learn that for himself . " <p> Said Shanahan , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens to you . You 're 35 years old , you 're in the league for four years , you 're a little bit naive It was one of those experiences in life that you have to go through . You learn from it and you go on . " <p> Shanahan not only survived his torturous tenure in Los Angeles , he was able to come full circle . He was the hottest head-coaching prospect in the league in 1988 , when Davis hired him . Six years later , he again was the hottest commodity on the market . <p> This time , Shanahan was n't going to take any chances . <p> " After what happened , you get a little older and a little more mature , " he said . " I was n't going to leave San Francisco for just any head-coaching job . You get a little older and wiser and you decide what you want out of life and out of a head-coaching job . Then you make your decisions . " <p> Shanahan 's decision was to return to Denver , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the late ' 80s . No matter where he is , though , his Raiders experience will be with him . It 's become part of his makeup . It 's made him more determined than ever to prove that he can be a successful head coach in the NFL . <p> " This is a tough business , a tough game , " he said . " People are going to knock you down . Are you a guy who stays down or do you come back fighting ? It 's the same in business , it 's the same in everyday life . People are going to take shots at you and say you ca n't get the job done . You 've got to prove to yourself that , ' Hey , I 'm tough enough to handle that situation and quiet the critics . ' You 've got to prove to yourself on a day-to-day basis that you can get the job done . " <p> Now it can be said : Shanahan , after being fired by Reeves following the 1991 season , wondered if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For all the confidence he had in himself , he kept hearing that he had gotten himself into another no-win situation . An outsider trying to conform to the 49ers ' ways . It sounded eerily like the things he heard when he accepted the Raiders job . <p> " I always thought when I went to San Francisco that that was going to be my biggest challenge as an offensive coordinator because the standards were so high , " he said . " You were thrown into an environment where a lot of people told me , ' Hey , you ca n't succeed . There 's no possible way , coming from the outside , not being a Bill Walsh disciple . What you 're doing is committing suicide . " ' <p> Shanahan was undaunted . As things turned out , he elevated the 49ers ' offense to unparalleled heights . But he was just another face in a crowd of front-office and coaching talent . Even if he had ascended to head coach , he still would n't have been in control of personnel . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front office , and Shanahan would n't have been at the top . <p> After his nightmarish experience with the Raiders , Shanahan wanted to do things his way . Bowlen , for his part , was more than happy to let him . Amazing as it sounds , you could make a strong argument that Shanahan , in his first year on the job , is the most powerful head coach in the league - Don Shula notwithstanding . <p> " The commitment Pat made to me was a big part of it , " said Shanahan . " He knew what we needed to get done and how we needed to do it , especially with the lack of draft choices we had and considering the lack of depth on the football team . I needed that commitment from him . I needed to know that I 'd be the guy making the final decisions so we would n't be in this situation again . <p> " The way I look at this profession is , if you do n't produce , you 're gone . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a situation where the owner has given you every opportunity to be successful ? If you have that opportunity , then you can only look back at yourself if you do n't get the job done . " <p> That is n't in Shanahan 's plans . He has a clear picture of how he wants to build the franchise . And no , it does n't include signing hordes of unrestricted free agents to fill gaping holes on the roster . Circumstances dictate that this year , but Shanahan does n't see free agents en masse as the answer to the Broncos ' problems . <p> " People talk about a quick fix , but what else can you do ? " he said . " What other direction can you possibly go ? What you 'd like to have is a full set of draft choices and make sure your first three draft picks are potential starters . That 's what you have to do , especially with the salary cap . <p> " You 're going to make mistakes . Everybody I 've ever known in this game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those mistakes . Those younger players are going to have to play at a reduced salary over a five-year time frame so you can have some type of balance in your pay structure . <p> " You 've got to have players who are starters , who play at that level . You need players like Tom Nalen . You 've got to have those types of players because eventually they 'll get the money . It 's all about balance . You 've got to have your draft choices produce or you lose that balance . " <p> While Shanahan is intent on rebuilding the franchise , he faces an interesting dichotomy . He wants to secure the Broncos ' future , but , with Elway having reached age 35 , he needs to win now . <p> " Everything is about winning , " said Shanahan . " Everything you do , on the field and off , is about winning . I mean , do you win in this market three years from now ? I do n't know how you do that . You used to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go out and improve your football team . There was no free-agent market and no salary cap . So you have to understand how the system works now compared to what it was . " <p> Another obvious question : What happens when Elway leaves ? Shanahan , in the first year of a seven-year contract , does n't want to ponder what life without Elway will be like . <p> " John 's not going anywhere , " he said . " I think seven years sounds about right , do n't you ? " <p> Unfortunately , that 's one thing Shanahan ca n't control .
