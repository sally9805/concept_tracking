IT WAS A DELICATE THING in Daniel 's grasp , as though a single rash gesture might crush it to bits of black crepe . As he rolled the kaleidoscope between his frigid hands , admiring its smooth texture , it flashed brilliant celestial light from its obsidian shell . He stood , mesmerized , galoshesdeep in the snow . <p> When he had seen it in the toy shop , tucked inconspicuously among stuffed animals , he 'd grabbed it without looking inside and brought it to the stout woman behind the counter . Days earlier his father had said with a sad , frail smile , " Here 's ten dollars . Get anything you want . We 're doing things a little different this Christmas . " <p> Daniel searched his coat pockets for three dollars . Out came a crumpled dollar and some nickels , though more change jingled in his right pocket . He remembered the hole in this particular pocket where change always fell into another dimension between the lining and outer material : a magician 's secret compartment . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a wooden shelf trimmed with holly . One last coin remained , and when Daniel freed it and laid it out with the rest of his money , he stared astonished at his balance . <p> Precisely three dollars . <p> As though he was destined to have the kaleidoscope . <p> Now outside the toy shop , he raised the cylinder and looked inside . <p> He gasped , then stood for a long , long time , motionless in the white winter snow . His head tilted back , two tears slid down his face and pooled in each ear . After a while he placed it carefully in his trousers pocket and walked home . <p> Lying in bed that night , he used a flashlight to illuminate the kaleidoscope 's interior . Across the room his older brother Aaron tossed violently in bed to stress a point . Before their mother died such a thing as a flashlight would not keep Aaron awake , but now it irritated him the way everything did these days . <p> " For crying out loud , put that thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He made to position the light beneath his pillow . Aaron shot up in bed and hissed : " What did I say - ! ? Daniel clicked off the light . <p> One clear , cold afternoon Daniel arrived home to find the house unnaturally still . <p> " Dad ? " he called , setting his schoolbooks upon the kitchen table . He walked through the living room , hearing only dying embers in the fireplace and the melancholy tick-tock of the grandfather clock . He half expected to see Dad in his chair , smiling at the newspaper funnies . When Mom was alive his father laughed out loud . Daniel turned the corner where their Christmas tree had stood in years past and headed upstairs . <p> Dad was sitting on Daniel 's bed and , while making it up after his son forgot to that morning , had apparently discovered the kaleidoscope . He wondered how long his father had sat there staring frozen into the iridescent tube . Dad reluctantly pulled the kaleidoscope away and Daniel noticed a reddened imprint around his eye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trancelike at him , his eyes bloodshot , as though tears had flowed but long ago dried . <p> Finally Dad handed him the toy and said , " Keep it in a safe place , son . " <p> Brittle sunlight played gently through the frost-speckled window , imbuing the bedroom in kaleidoscopic patterns . Daniel opened his eyes a fraction , watching water swim in his vision : the tearful remnants of sorrowful dreams . He fully opened his eyes and the phantoms dissipated to sparkling snowflakes like the ones finished falling outside . <p> He sat up and looked upon Aaron 's vacant bed . His brother rose early , rain or shine , sometimes a full hour before he himself awoke . Seeing a clear coast , he slid his hand beneath the pillow ... <p> ... and found empty space . <p> Daniel sprang to his knees-instantly awake-and ripped his pillow from the mattress . Bare . The world spun . He jumped to the floor and frantically wrestled his blankets off the bed , shaking out the sheets , spreading each blanket flat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his flashlight under the boxspring . Breathless , he yanked his bed to the center of the room . Where was it ? Where was it ? <p> Aaron strolled into the room , redfaced from exposure , his clothes spattered with snow . Daniel turned on him , panicked , verging on tears and black rage . " What did you do with it ? " he screamed . <p> " Huh ? " replied Aaron . <p> " The kaleidoscope ! What have you done with the kaleidoscope ? " <p> " Oh , that . " Aaron poked around in his pockets , shook his head . " Sorry , sport . I musta lost it . " <p> " You what ? " Daniel trembled furiously . <p> " It looked kinda neat , I du n no . I put it in my jacket when I went out sledding . I was gon na stop and look in it . Guess I forgot . " <p> Daniel felt the world crumbling around him . <p> " Hey , " said Aaron , becoming quarrelsome again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toy anyhow ? " <p> Daniel yelled and leaped on him , thrashing wildly . He crushed him to the floor , snarling like a rabid animal , raking his nails into exposed flesh . Aaron shrieked in pained surprise . <p> Dad burst into the room , and after separating the boys , heard the story through their labored breath . Dad looked as though a giant skyscraper had collapsed in him . Silently he sat down , right in the midst of all the clutter , right down on the floor he plopped , and put his face in his hands . Aaron , bewildered and outright frightened by this display , ran out of the room . <p> Daniel looked out the window as his brother , whom he truly did not hate now , bounded away from the house , leaving ragged holes in the pristine snow . <p> Dinner was mournfully quiet that evening . Dad had not punished Aaron-had n't talked about the kaleidoscope at all-and , in fact , hugged him along with Daniel as both boys went up to bed . Dad then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> No sleep claimed Daniel as he lay on his side . He closed his wet eyes halfway in the gloom , but what he saw could not touch the fragile beauty and magic of his lost kaleidoscope . <p> During the night Aaron cried out in his sleep . Daniel rolled over to see him sitting and sobbing in darkness . When Dad came in and sat down , Aaron threw his arms around him . Daniel pretended to sleep as he watched them . <p> " Ssshhh , " whispered Dad . " It 's okay now . " <p> Aaron 's voice , muffled against his father 's chest , drifted across the room . <p> " Dad , I had a dream about Mom . " <p> Daniel 's heart caught in his chest , for Aaron had barely mentioned their mother since cancer had taken her from them all . <p> " In the dream , I saw her pretty face . Oh , I wish I could see her again ! " <p> Daniel swallowed hard , trying not to make a sound as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look inside the kaleidoscope . <p> Author Affiliation
