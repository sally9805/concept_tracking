<p> Birmingham - Bobby Allison stood in a corridor at Carraway Methodist Medical Center Monday on this city 's north side , his face an expressionless mask portraying none of the horror that once again had struck his family . <p> Two elderly Catholic priests were talking to him , but Allison , NASCAR 's Winston Cup champion in 1983 , did n't seem to hear . Six floors above him his sole surviving son , NASCAR driver Davey Allison , was struggling to live . <p> " He is in serious , serious condition , " Allison , 56 , said . " The helicopter was very low to the ground and something happened and it crashed . " <p> Davey Allison , 32 , was landing his new Hughes 500 helicopter at Talladega Superspeedway about 3 p.m . Monday when the aircraft flipped . Allison suffered serious head and lung injuries and a broken pelvis . His passenger , veteran racer Red Farmer , also suffered injuries but they were less serious . <p> " I hope and pray he can recover from this , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drives . " But he the doctor does n't give us any encouragement . " <p> Benny Parsons , a former driver-turned television racing analyst who was with the Allison family , sequestered on the hospital 's upper floors , said of Allison 's condition , " It 's really bad . It looks like it 's going to take a miracle . " <p> Allison and his wife , Liz , have two children , Krista Marie , 3 , and Robert , who will turn 2 later this month . <p> Allison underwent surgery to relieve pressure caused by bleeding from his brain . While hospital authorities said he was not in a coma , Yates and others who saw him said he was unresponsive . <p> " There were working on him feverishly , " said Yates , who had flown in Allison 's plane from New Hampshire to Charlotte after Sunday 's Winston Cup race . " I wanted to ask the doctor if people recover from this . I did n't ask that . I was afraid to ask that . I did n't think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second air tragedy to hit NASCAR in six months . Alan Kulwicki , the 1992 Winston Cup champion , was killed April 1 when a private plane in which he was a passenger crashed in Tennessee . <p> Sunday after the race at Loudon , N.H. , Allison and the Yates team said they felt like the dark clouds which have seemed to hover over the Allison family might have lifted . <p> Allison had run third and had a chance to win . <p> " We have n't run good the last few weeks and maybe this will get the race for the points championship back under us , " Allison , who is fifth in the Winston Cup points standings , said then . <p> Around the garage area at recent NASCAR races buttons reading " Bobby 's Back " had seemed to sprout like mushrooms after a rain . After a long ordeal caused by an 1988 crash that ended his driving career , the elder Allison once again was a fixture around the garages . Much was made of the fact doctors recently cleared him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first race since the accident last month in a made-for-TV Fast Masters event for drivers 50 and over at Indianapolis . <p> " We left there Loudon like we 'd won the race , " Yates said . " We were making a lot of plans for the future . Now we have this . " <p> For those around the Allison family the most recent tragedy continued a line of misfortune which has seemed to stalk them , ending lives as well as careers . <p> " You ca n't believe all this is happening to one family , " said driver Hut Stricklin , a son-in-law of Donnie Allison , Bobby 's brother . " There is nothing in the world this family could have done to make you wish this on them . I 'm just sitting here in shock . " <p> The Allisons were nicknamed " The Alabama Gang " when Bobby , Donnie and fellow Alabama driver Farmer were short-track terrors around the South in the 1960s . The Gang was reborn in the late 1970s and early 1980s when the Allisons cut a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered his near-fatal crash at Pocono International Raceway that forced him to retire . <p> Allison , the patriarch of the family , is tied for third on the all- time Winston Cup win list with 84 victories . His brother , Donnie , had 10 . <p> As Bobby stepped aside , Davey , his oldest son , came on , taking 16 of his 19 career wins since his father retired . His most recent win was in March at Richmond . But Davey 's success was tempered by the death of his younger brother , Clifford , last August . Clifford , 27 , was killed while practicing for a Busch Grand National race at Michigan International Speedway . <p> Last June , when Allison returned to the Michigan track for the first time since his brother 's death , he said he walked to the turn where the accident happened . <p> " I wanted to see it , " Allison said then . " I saw it and now it 's over . It wo n't affect the way I race . " <p> Allison qualified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad luck was nothing new . Last season he led in the points standings before crashing twice , once at Charlotte and once at Pocono , the track which ended his father 's career . He went into the season-ending race at Atlanta Motor Speedway leading the points standings , but a crash in the Hooters 500 left him third for the year . <p> Still , Allison swore at the beginning of the season that nothing which had befallen his family would affect him . <p> " You can handle it on the track , " Parsons said . " My family has seen me crash hundreds of times . Drivers on the track laugh about it . . . . But you ca n't comprehend this . " <p> Details of Monday 's crash , which is being investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration , were sketchy . There was a report that the helicopter 's tail rotor struck a fence , causing the crash , but Jim Freeman , Talladega 's publicity director , said that did not happen . <p> Freeman said he got an eyewitness account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the track 's infield care center who was watching the aircraft land . <p> According to Freeman , Smith said she was waving to Farmer , who was in the copter 's passenger seat and waving back at her . The helicopter was hovering only inches from the ground . Suddenly it lifted about three or four feet up and began moving from side to side . Smith said she thought the pilot was merely showing off , and that she did not sense any trouble . <p> The helicopter then continued to rise until it was about 30 feet in the air , and its body began to turn under the rotor blade . The aircraft fell , landing on the passenger side , shattering the bubble of the cockpit . <p> Farmer was able to free himself from his harness and begin trying to kick his way out . Neil Bonnett , a NASCAR driver who was helping his son with testing at the track , heard the crash from the garage area . " What 's that ? " he said . " A helicopter just crashed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first one to reach the craft . He began to pull Farmer , who was conscious , from the wreckage . Farmer said , " Get Davey out . " <p> Because the copter 's engine was still running , and Bonnett was afraid of an e xplosion , he dragged Farmer away . Allison was trapped in the upper side of the cockpit , trapped by his own weight against his harness . Smith was then boosted into the cockpit by Bonnett , and she cut the harness straps , freeing Allison . She then began to work on him , trying to clear his air passages . Yates said Smith told him that 's when Allison , who had been unconscious , responded to her . <p> Two rescue helicopters came from Birmingham to pick up the victims and take them to the hospital . <p> Allison had been flying for several years and had obtained his helicopter license about 18 months ago , Yates said . He had taken delivery of the helicopter he crashed only two weeks ago . <p> Stricklin said he had flown with Allison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helicopter . <p> " I could n't believe it because I knew what kind of pilot Davey was , " Stricklin said . " I 've flown with him lots of places . I know how careful he was . " <p> Despite that , earlier this year Allison had a close call while landing at Indianapolis . He was piloting his plane to a press conference announcing next year 's Brickyard 400 , the first NASCAR race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway , when another private plane came very close to his . <p> Associated Press <p> Davey Allison is fifth in the points standings . <p> The Allison family 's previous misfortunes : <p> June 19 , 1988 : Bobby Allison , one of the winningest drivers in stock car racing history , is forced to retire after a crash at Pocono International Raceway in Long Pond , Pa. , leaves him near death for a week . <p> May 16 , 1992 : Davey Allison , Bobby 's son , wins The Winston , NASCAR 's All-Star race , as he edges Kyle Petty at the finish line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sent spinning into a wall .
