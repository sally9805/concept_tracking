( JESS AND GENNY SIT ON AN OLD GLIDER IN GERTRUDE 'S YARD . THEY ARE READING ABOUT THE RETURN TRIP IN THE DIARY OF CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS . THE SUN IS HIGH OVER THEM . GERTRUDE IS SWEEPING HER PORCH WHEN SHE HEARS HENRY . ) HENRY Jess there ? ( SHE GOES BACK TO SWEEPING . ) Jess over that ? ( SILENCE . ) GERTRUDE Come look for yourself . HENRY I ca n't get through the woods , old woman . GERTRUDE Put on your hiking boots . HENRY I ca n't get through the gulley . GERTRUDE Start your old truck , Henry . Drive to the main road , and come down my little road . HENRY Your little road is nothing but two ruts . GERTRUDE Then walk to the main road . HENRY What ? GERTRUDE He ca n't hear neither . HENRY There 's a ravine between the cabins . p. 3 GERTRUDE ( TO HERSELF . ) Thank goodness . HENRY You say you fly in your dreams , Gertrude . Maybe I should try that . ( GERTRUDE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DIARY . ) The return voyage to Spain after the discovery of America . JESS ( JESS SITS ON THE ARM OF THE GLIDER ROWING . ) A ship on the ocean  --  toolin ' down the waves . A roller coaster ride . Whoot Whoot . We find new world . ( JESS ROWS LIKE HE 'S PLAYING A SLOT MACHINE . ) GENNY ( SHE IGNORES JESS AND CONTINUES TO READ THE DIARY . ) To-night the wind increases and the waves are frightful . The ship carries her mainsail low , just high enough to keep out of the waves . I run before the wind wherever it carries me , for there is nothing else to do . GERTRUDE Sometimes I hear a restless voice . Help me get home . I 'm out in the woods in the gulley between the cabins looking for blackberries , and I wonder who it is . Then I hear Genny . Great Jehovah . I think . My granddaughter 's dragging in Columbus . The spirit of the one and only . p. 4 GENNY ( CONTINUES TO READ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHE READS . ) Then the caravel , the Pinta , disappears , though I make signal-lights all night . About dawn she answers , though it appears she can do no more because of the storm , and she 's far off course . When the sun rises , the wind is greater and the cross-seas more terrible . GERTRUDE ( SOON HENRY SHOWS UP . ) How 'd you get here ? ( STARTLED . ) HENRY I changed into a squirrel . GERTRUDE I always knew you had two other feet somewhere . HENRY Your hair 's standing up there in front like a war bonnet . GERTRUDE My granddaughter moussed it . My hair was getting thin . She said it would hold it off my head . HENRY You sure look like something . Where is she ? GERTRUDE Right there with Jess . ( JESS AND GENNY GREET HENRY . ) HENRY He been over har much ? GERTRUDE Sometimes  --  they 're reading the diary of Christopher Columbus for one of their classes  --  p. 5 GENNY And interpreting it in our own way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  First thing 's interested Jess in school  --  other than baseball . But it seems like he 's over here all the time  --  GERTRUDE No he 's not , Henry . Kids are going to be gone a lot . Get used to it . HENRY I saw in a dream he would come to me . I saw him listening to the stories . GERTRUDE The gulley that runs between our cabins is really between us and what we were in the old days , Henry . HENRY Why are n't we friends ? GERTRUDE We live so close , I can see the light in your cabin at night . HENRY That 's cause Jess 's up trying to wire the television . He 's got some sort of aerial made out of a coat hanger and the tinfoil off our TV dinners . GERTRUDE You even got coat hangers ? ( JESS AND GENNY READ THE DIARY . GERTRUDE SWEEPS .

I want to return to Spain  --  I want to be there NOW . p. 6 JESS Vroom . ( JERKING AN IMAGINARY SLOT MACHINE HANDLE . ) GENNY I want them to know I turned out to be RIGHT  --  in ALL I said I would discover  --  JESS VROOMMMM ! ! GENNY I 'm SO afraid of not getting back with my news  --  JESS The winds go **25;665;TOOLONG . The sea goes SWUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU . All on a Saturday night . ( JESS STEERS THE SHIP AND CRANKS THE ARM OF A SLOT MACHINE . ) HENRY I 'm supposed tell Jess our stories to preserve our past , and he 's over here talking like Columbus and working the slot machine ? GERTRUDE It 's for school . ( GERTRUDE SITS ON THE EDGE OF THE PORCH WITH HER BROOM . THE SUN IS LOWERED IN THE SKY WITH A SQUEAK . ) HENRY It 's Genny too . He likes her . And it 's your cooking , Gertrude . Jess and I sit on the porch sometimes and think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bean chili or Indian tacos  --  GERTRUDE Jess says you have stew every night  --  HENRY Jess been eating here too ? p. 7 GERTRUDE Do you think we 'd have supper without asking him when he 's sitting right here in the yard ? HENRY Do n't seem like I 'm too far away either . Maybe I 'll come more often . GERTRUDE At night I can hear you snore . HENRY That 's the woodpecker . GERTRUDE I throw gravel at your dog when he comes over to chase my cat under the porch . HENRY We could be friends  --  we could step out together at the Pow Wow  --  GERTRUDE Yes  --  Genny and I went to the last Pow Wow . I did n't used to go . I was afraid I would n't get the steps right . It 's something you got to feel within . HENRY I was at the Pow Wow . I saw your beaded moccasins stepping under those skirts . GERTRUDE I did n't see you . HENRY You 're an old woman , Gertrude . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in the circle dance . All you old crows with moussed hair . GERTRUDE It 's the trend . HENRY Why do n't you ask me to dance in the turnabout ? p. 8 GERTRUDE I did n't see you , remember ? HENRY You could still ask me to dance . That 's the way it is now . GERTRUDE So I 've heard . JESS ( JESS IS SERIOUS A MOMENT INTERPRETING THE DIARY . THE SUN IS LOWERED IN THE SKY AGAIN WITH A SQUEAK . ) You know how you have news you want to deliver but must travel there , and you fear that something might happen before you get there , and all would be taken from you , and you would be prevented from arriving with your news . And you would perish from the earth . Wiped out like water spilled across the floor . And you wonder why you carry such a burden . It must be that the Great Spirit loves you because he chooses you to carry the burden . Who else could he have entrusted ? Not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the throne . Not my wife 's brothers  --  her people . Their righteous backsides all over the couches of the courts of Spain . No . It was me  --  though they actually laughed at my desire to discover the New World . How they fed salt to my wounds . How they stroked my powerlessness . Now they 'll know . If only I could kick this ship to go faster . To get into higher mode . Maybe that 's what all the waves are doing . Waving me onward . Sweeping me back to Spain . GENNY Hurry , hurry , ships . p. 9 JESS Phooooooooooooooooooo say the waves . Swuuuuuuu says the wind . HENRY Columbus wrote suuuu in his diary ? GERTRUDE Genny and Jess read the diary , and write it their own way . Get with it , Henry . History is rewritten . What is it anyway but someone 's opinion ? We can add our interpretation to it now  --  HENRY Now wait  --  GERTRUDE That 's what you 're doing when you tell Jess stories . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own way . HENRY But  --  JESS We 're supposed to rewrite the diary , Henry . Add our voice . Change history . Wow . What is all history but human storytelling ? Someone 's point-of-view . We need more voices to tell the story . GERTRUDE The voice of stories running like a rabbit to the ear . Soon you got a headful of rabbits . GENNY ( READING AGAIN WITH HER FINGER MOVING ALONE THE WORDS . ) I ought to believe God will grant me the completion of what I began , and will not thwart me now that I see my destination . He would not give me this treasure chest to carry back to Isabel and trip me up before I get to her court . He will not stick His pin in this ship and deflate it so that it goes down with a few air bubbles waving from the sea .

JESS IS BY HIMSELF AT THE EDGE OF THE STAGE . SOON HENRY JOINS HIM . GERTRUDE IS ON HER PORCH . GENNY IS IN THE CABIN . ) JESS I loaned a friend some money and he 's not going to pay me back . HENRY ( PAUSE . ) There was a rock in the middle of the sky and the rock grew crowded and the animals started falling off to the waters below . JESS You told me not to loan anybody  --  HENRY ( INTERRUPTS . ) The animals did n't want to drown  --  no  --  they wanted some dry ground where they could go . So the elk swam to the bottom of the waters and brought up some mud , and the mud grew on the waters and formed Turtle Island  --  which became known as America . JESS My best friend  --  HENRY When the land was still mud , the elk rolled over and over , and left his hairs in the mud that sprouted trees and bushes  --  ( A PERSON IN AN ELK MASK &amp; ANTLERS WALKS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AFTER A MOMENT , HENRY CONTINUES HIS STORY . ) But there was darkness in the new land . The animals remembered there was a sun above the rock in the sky . They traveled back to lasso the sun . Yes  --  it was the bear who shot his arrow into the sun and dragged it to the new land . p. 12 JESS At school my friend acted like he did n't know me  --  HENRY The animals set the sun on a pulley and cranked it across the sky each day . At night , it rolled under Turtle Island , until it was ready to cross the sky again . But at first , the bear got the sun too close  --  and it burned some of Turtle Island into desert as it sank in the west and scorched some of the animals . The bear lifted the sun a little higher , but it was still too low . There was a little bird that flitted everywhere  --  and the bear warned him to wait until they got the sun working right  --  but the bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red bird is red to this day . Then the bear lifted the crank higher and finally the sun was right . ( PAUSE . ) Listen to our stories , Jess . When you feel hurt , think of them . Healing is creating something . The more you listen , the more you have to tell  --  our stories go on and on . ( JESS SITS LEANING OVER WITH HIS CHIN RESTING IN HIS HANDS . THE CRANKERS OF THE SUN ARE NOW VISIBLE . THE LARGE YELLOW BALL OF THE SUN ITSELF IS PULLED OFF STAGE BY A HAND CRANK WITH A SQUEAK EACH TIME IT MOVES , SOON DISAPPEARING TO ROLL UNDER THE STAGE TO RISE IN THE EAST AGAIN . THE STAGE IS LIT NOW BY THE FRONT PORCH LIGHT ON GERTRUDE 'S CABIN AND BY A LIGHT FROM INSIDE HER CABIN. ) p. 13 JESS Sometimes I feel the old memories in my head . I think we 're like the six directions  --  north , east , south , west , sky , earth  --  we have them all in us  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . I like to dance at the Pow Wow  --  but I ca n't beat others . I can listen to you , Henry , and know the Old World . I thought at first it was just something you were talking about . You gave me a place to live . It 's better than the street . I was getting sick from the stuff they pass around , you know . Sometimes I see what you mean . I can play baseball and take garage mechanics at school and work on your old truck and feel the New World  --  when I want stuff again , I can tell you . Healing is a process , you say . It does n't happen all at once . GENNY ( SHE COMES TO THE PORCH WHERE GERTRUDE SITS . ) I wish it was n't late . I 'd go to the mall . HENRY Someday , Jess , you 'll feel harmony with the earth again  --  you 'll feel it . GERTRUDE I do n't want you out in Warren 's old car after dark . GENNY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GENNY I 've got school . GERTRUDE Afterwards . p. 14 GENNY I 've got to work on the diary  --  GERTRUDE You find time for what you want to do . GENNY Can you fly in your dreams , Grandma ? GERTRUDE So Henry says . GENNY Where do you go ? GERTRUDE Wherever the dreams take me  --  sometimes to the past . Sometimes  --  I do n't know where it is . GENNY Sometimes I hear the spirits in the woods  --  GERTRUDE Yes  --  they 're there . GENNY You 're not afraid ? GERTRUDE Never  --  I hear the spirits a lot  --  in the woods  --  in the kitchen . Sometimes in K-Mart even , I think I see the spirits . They stand in the aisles looking at the things they never had . Looking at the things they never knew they needed . All lined up on all those shelves . Mostly they stand there with their mouths open  --  Get used to it , I tell them .

THE SUN IS CRANKED FROM THE EAST TO LATE IN THE WEST . HENRY 'S DOG BARKS . THE CAT HISSES . GENNY SITS ON THE GLIDER . JESS IS STANDING NEAR THE OLD GLIDER PRETENDING TO HIT BASEBALLS . GERTRUDE AND HENRY SIT ON THE EDGE OF HER PORCH . ) GERTRUDE Were you in the woods last night , Henry ? HENRY I was talking to Jess . GERTRUDE The spirits were close  --  HENRY Yo  --  I saw them . GERTRUDE I sit on my porch of an evening and hear the voices . They come around because they know I 'm not doing anything but stirring my black bean chili . There 's this one voice who 's always trying to please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . HENRY Old women hear too many voices . GERTRUDE Say what you want . Those voices are company to me . Better than an old man who just wants some chili . HENRY Yes  --  I can smell your chili across the gulley . It do n't have to go back to the main road , but moves through the woods greased as a spirit . Yes  --  I know when you brown the venison  --  the onions and garlic . I say  --  yes , Jess  --  Gertrude and Genny 're having chili for supper . Now Gert 's stirrin ' in the chili powder  --  p. 17 GERTRUDE Then the tomatoes  --  corn  --  potatoes  --  cayenne pepper  --  coriander  --  the rice vinegar  --  the green peppers and chilis . HENRY Yes  --  I say Gertrude 's stirring her pot just like a witch . Holding the tongue of a man in her apron pocket . How do you get by without a man to feed ? GERTRUDE It 's easy  --  there were times I thought it was n't  --  after my husband died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honored the onions and chopped them up . Sometimes I thought their roots looked like straws on our old ceremonial masks  --  or the tufts on my husband 's old head . At first I made too much cornbread , but I took some to neighbors or to church , and learned to cut the recipe . What I really like is having the house to myself . To cook and listen to my little recorder . I bought tapes at the K-Mart . My favorite place to go . I could spend the day stirring by myself and be happy  --  HENRY The heart of a witch  --  did n't I tell you , Jess ? ( JESS SITS IN THE GLIDER AND READS THE DIARY . ) GERTRUDE Put a moccasin on it , Henry . GENNY ( READING . ) He delivered me on the outward voyage , when I had greater reason to fear my troubles  --  when the sailors were determined to go back  --  and to rise against me in protest . But the eternal God gave me strength and resolution against all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fear the sea . I 've left notes everywhere . In several journals  --  some for myself  --  some for the sovereigns . I would write my journals in the sky if I could . I would write them on the sea . The waves would bring my message to shore . I would strap my words to the bodies of birds . I would write until the words pulled the birds down to the water . Ouch ! I 'm wet . The birds call . Help . Gulp . They sink into the sea . The water 's seafingers between their feathers like lead weights pulling them down . HENRY They doing the return trip ? GERTRUDE I think you 're getting it , Henry . Genny reads the diary , then Jess says it in his own way . HENRY This rewritten history is hard to swallow . GENNY ( READING . ) I wrapped some messages in a well-tied , waxed cloth , and ordered a large wooden barrel brought , and I put the parchment in it without anyone learning what it was , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messages about the land I discovered , in case I did n't make it back . HENRY Sometimes , Gertrude , you think things are going along  --  you 're telling Jess the old stories , finally getting somewhere , you know  --  the dry land 's appearing  --  then something happens , and the road takes a different turn . You find him over here in the New World , you know . Only it 's the new New World . p. 19 GERTRUDE Yes , I remember sometimes after breakfast , I thought Warren and I would sit on the porch and talk  --  but you 'd call across the ravine  --  and Warren would be gone . You did n't do anything but drive off with my old husband fishing and who knows what  --  HENRY You did n't want to go with him . GERTRUDE Maybe I did . HENRY You got your black bean chili to stir . JESS Henry  --  will you come to school when we read our diary ? HENRY ( WITH FEAR . ) What ? ( TWITCHING HIS FOOT . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry  --  HENRY I ca n't come to school  --  GENNY You bring him , Grandma  --  JESS Genny 's in it too . GERTRUDE ( STARTLED . ) She did n't tell me . JESS She 's one of the natives who went back on the ship . GERTRUDE I guess I 'll know about it when she needs a costume made . p. 20 HENRY Maybe they did n't wear much . GERTRUDE It 's at school , Henry , there 'll be a costume . You know  --  your foot shuffled just like Warren 's . I tell you , he could keep me awake all night . He always traditional-danced in his sleep . His feet moving in the old bed kept me awake . Just like he was at the Pow Wow . There was no getting away from him . HENRY You want someone to fuss at . That 's what all you women want . GERTRUDE I 've got my voices . Sometimes I listen for my daughter in the night  --  but mostly I hear voices coming around complaining about this . Wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're dead . What trouble could they have ? I tell them it 's over for them . I say , face facts . JESS When I saw the spirits last night , Gen , I thought of my dad  --  he was a rabble rouser . A fancy-dancer . A dude . All I remember about him was his red tail lights down the road . And he wanted me to dance . All of a sudden  --  to be the best fancy-dancer at the Pow Wow . GENNY He wanted something for you  --  JESS I do n't know . I was dead weight for him . He dumped me with one of his old girlfriends . I was supposed to go to school . Everyday she 'd go to work and I was out the door . And it was n't to school . p. 21 GERTRUDE The voices that cry are the hardest . They see what 's happened to them . They know they 're left out . There 's no way they can get in . They whimper more than cry when they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's the Great Spirit and the Red Road . There 's Sunday church and baseball games of the New World . I tell them to get going . Our own feeble efforts are full of pride and dust . We need power from the outside . From God through Christ . HENRY You 're a real comforter , are n't you ? Remind me not to tell you any of my troubles . GERTRUDE I just tell them what they need to hear . JESS Now I have to write more of my part . I have to sing . HENRY Columbus sang ? JESS I guess he played the guitar . GERTRUDE Is this a musical ? JESS Well , we have to liven it up somehow . GENNY Maybe a floating casino  --  GERTRUDE There was a band on board the Nina ? JESS No  --  he sang his heart out to the waves  --  ( THE SUN IS CRANKED TO NEAR DARKNESS. ) p. 22 GENNY Maybe he talked to them each night the way Grandma talks to the little spirits tumbling to the shore of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I 'm jumping over you in my moccasins  --  I 'm driving over you in my ship  --  I 'm hoop-dancing over you waves .

THE SUN DISAPPEARS. ) p. 23 Act 1 , Scene 4 SCENE IV ( NEXT AFTERNOON . THE SUN IS CRANKED OVER GERTRUDE 'S CABIN AGAIN TO THE WEST . A DOG BARKS AND A CAT HISSES . HENRY SHOWS UP . ) HENRY I have n't seen Jess since morning . JESS ( LOOKS UP FROM THE GLIDER WITH GENNY . ) I had baseball after school . GERTRUDE When I visit the " old folks home , " Henry , sometimes I see all the lonely old men , and think of the women and children they 've left crying for them . They went out and just did what they wanted . I walk right by them  --  I do n't read them no magazines . HENRY Yes , even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my place , they eat out of my hand . I hear them talking about you  --  GERTRUDE Yes , Henry  --  and no matter how many boys you to bring to your place to tell our old stories to  --  they 're going to want to leave for the bars and bingo halls . GENNY Do n't be sure , Grandma . HENRY We 're not having anything to do with the casinos . JESS Speak for yourself , Henry . p. 24 HENRY There 's nothing wrong with earning a living . JESS A dealer is the new Medicine Man . The new Chief . All the girls like the dealers . GENNY Some of the girls are dealers . JESS Henry says he wo n't take casino money . HENRY I had a vision once of a red convertible coming down a hill . I always wanted a convertible , you know . GERTRUDE Yes  --  in my day , I always noticed the boys who had convertibles . GENNY It 's the dealers that got convertibles now , Grandma . JESS Your convertible is the casino , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take our ear away from the land . The car was a dream more than a vision  --  it was coming , and I got in it  --  and other people got in it , and the more people that got in it , the more room there was . GENNY Where were you going ? HENRY It 's our stories that 're the vehicle  --  GERTRUDE Some rocky country music on the radio . GENNY Country rock , Grandma . p. 25 GERTRUDE No  --  the rocks have tongues . JESS The rocks sounding maybe like Elvis ? GERTRUDE No  --  like my tapes I buy at K-Mart . HENRY Gertrude 's listening to hard rock  --  and she 's living in shouting distance of the church . GERTRUDE I got earphones too . Sometimes I wore them around Warren  --  when I did n't want to listen to him . I 'm thinking of Warren mowing during church . About the time the Reverend got into the sermon , Warren would crank up his John Deere and let it rip . HENRY You ca n't hear the Thunder Beings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be thankful to them . GERTRUDE You should go to church , Henry . It 's just down the road . HENRY When you find God is when you find yourself . Warren and I had our own church  --  when we were out on the lake fishing  --  hooting it up over a trout  --  the Thunder Beings clapping their hands  --  GERTRUDE Well  --  he might not be so noisy in outer space . The Great Spirit 's probably giving him the south 4000 to mow . I hear the grass grows pretty good in the wilderness out there all watered by solar rains . That 's what the spirits tell me anyway . p. 26 HENRY The spirits tell me I 'm at the center of the universe . GERTRUDE That 's what 's wrong with you Traditionals . You 're wrapped up in yourselves . HENRY No  --  I wo n't be getting any supper here . GERTRUDE I used to feel left out , Henry , when you and Warren went off down the road . I felt I was nothing to him . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  no one was with me . But I thought , I believe in Jesus . I do n't care if no one else stays with me . I 'll sit in church by myself my whole life . Yes . It 's worth it because I want to go to the heaven I heard about in church . HENRY Yar  --  where we 're transformed into angels with wings on our backs and halos twirling around our heads like ceiling fans at K-Mart  --  JESS I 'm seeing electric spirits  --  ( TWO CHARACTERS DRESSED AS AN ELK AND BEAR CROSS THE BACK OF THE STAGE . ) Yo  --  a neon voyage  --  do you see them , Gen ? GENNY I see something moving  --  a shadow or something  --  sometimes the animals come to the edge of the woods  --  sometimes I think it 's my mamma trying to get back . JESS ( THE SPIRITS DISAPPEAR . ) Them were real live sparks  --  p. 27 GENNY Hey , Jess  --  we could wire the Nina , Pinta and Santa Maria  --  then we would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we 're acoustical too . HENRY When I went on my vision quest  --  I went up on that hill down the road there and sat for four days . I did n't see any K-Mart in my vision . Nothing of the New World . I saw three blackbirds . I do n't know what they meant . I 've wondered about them all my life . I think we do n't understand anything that happens to us . GERTRUDE I 'm surprised a squirrel is n't your power animal . HENRY Why are n't you out blackberry picking , old woman ? GERTRUDE Because I do n't have anyone other than Genny and Jess to bake a pie for  --  ( HENRY LEAVES AND GERTRUDE GOES IN HER CABIN . ) JESS ( STILL SHAKING HIS HEAD . ) Gertrude 's a hard woman  --  GENNY Grandma took care of me when nobody would .

I 'd stay out all night in bars and bingo halls . Keep me in church , Grandma , I say  --  p. 28 JESS My father and mother ignored the heritage too  --  even though they heard . They went to bars and stayed out all night . I was born ignorant . " Drinking is better than dreaming , " my father said .

The seventh is the center , Jess  --  wherever we are is the center of the earth . Wherever we are is home  --  JESS Come on , Genny  --  GENNY My mamma freaked out because of me . I remember it . She started screaming . I do n't know what happened . I remember rocking the crib . I know it bumped the wall . Over and over . JESS It was n't your fault .

Now Jess 's here as much as he 's with you . HENRY Fair turnabout . GERTRUDE Do you ever hear him ? HENRY The old man ?  --  naw . GERTRUDE Sometimes I think I hear him stirring in the kitchen at night . Looking for a cookie . Or else it 's a squirrel got in . Rattling the breadloaf . Getting into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them sacks . All them plastic wrappers . Just in case we run short of them the earth can come to you for more wrappers . The old man used to talk about the sacks and jars you got lined up . You got jars to string from here to Muskogee . GERTRUDE Probably farther . HENRY When you think you hear Warren at night , it 's just them sacks taking on their own lives . That 's what happens when something gets too many numbers . You get too many of them and soon they think they are something . They think they are a whole nation . And they up and have themselves a Pow Wow right there in the kitchen in the night and keep old ladies awake . p. 34 GERTRUDE What else did you talk about ? HENRY Me and Warren ? ( GERTRUDE NODS . ) Just about your wrappers . Sometimes the squirrels . GERTRUDE What did you say about them ? HENRY How to tame them . GERTRUDE What do the squirrels say about me , Henry ? HENRY They say not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die any day . Sometimes I hear the spirits shuffle in the room . I tell them I do n't want to go  --  HENRY Maybe they 're playing cards and do n't want to bother with you yet . GERTRUDE When my daughter was born , I did n't know what I was doing . I had enough burdens just being a person . I could n't take care of myself , and then I had a child to worry about . How can we have kids before we get ourselves ready for them ? Later , I tried to teach her the old ways but she would n't listen  --  I did n't listen to the old ways either until one time we went back to South Carolina . My husband wanted to go back to the old territory . The place his grandfather mentioned his father left . I was in some little town somewhere a church had burned . Warren picked up a rock , but I found a brick . The church had burned and I picked up a burned brick . It even had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got it there right inside the door . The only time I was ever out of Oklahoma . I wish I could take Genny back to the old territory with me . Warren and I were n't there no more than no time , when I heard the voices . They were chattering like the squirrels you talk to , Henry . p. 35 HENRY To know the squirrels in the ravine is to know the whole world . GERTRUDE Yes , the place was full of voices . We found a road , and soon we were driving down it . We came to a house and stopped to ask directions , and Warren got to talking to the man , and before you know it we were having supper . He and his wife were like our kin . Soon others showed up and we had an old council meeting . We did some talking . On the way back , I said to Warren , do you think they were really there , or was it the old world we seen ? Was it our ancestors come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you  --  when I was there in South Carolina , I heard the spirits  --  more than I hear them here . On the way home , I remember hearing little restless voices along side the road . They were crying , Henry , because they had n't listened to God . They had been stubborn and wanted their own way . It was too late for them  --  HENRY That old Jehovah 's got a hard nose . He wo n't hear nothing but His own way . GERTRUDE It 's for our own good , Henry . HENRY I do n't see it that way , Gert . I do n't see anything unless of course you want to count the visions . Then I can go anywhere . I can fly like you  --  GERTRUDE You know I carried that brick with me all the way back here . Burned and broken in two . Even when Warren laughed . I do n't care . I like the black smudges on the red brick . I talk to him sometimes now . I know it 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Warren ? You know , I can still feel the old territory in that brick . p. 36 HENRY That 's what we 're here for  --  to see the visions and to help one another . A while back , Jess loaned a friend some money and he did n't pay it back . He feels bitter  --  because he feels powerless . GERTRUDE Stay with him , Henry . The minute you turn your back , he 'll be off to the casino in Arbuckle . He wo n't even finish school . They all want to be dealers . It 's a job . How can you argue with that ? Purposelessness or a dealer with a casino around you like heaven . HENRY I saw in my vision there would be young people wanting to know their heritage . GERTRUDE No , Henry  --  most of them 're born nowadays saying , jackpot . I do n't blame them . I remember the times I wanted someone to say it was all right , that I would be taken care of , that the square edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's still a struggle everyday . My daughter felt it too . She felt nobody in the New World cared . She got that old disease of hopelessness and dependency . She did n't find her Indian spirit on the other side of all that . Nothing I can do can call her back . She went crazy on drugs , Henry . You know that . Later one of her boyfriends killed her  --  when it looked like there was hope  --  HENRY History may be a construction job , Gertrude , but then you run up against the hard wall of it . p. 37 GERTRUDE People still look at Genny in the stores . Somehow the shots missed her . ( SHE BLOWS HER NOSE . HENRY TRIES TO COMFORT HER , BUT SHE HITS BOTH HIM AND THE MEMORY AWAY WITH HER FLY SWATTER . ) I ask the spirits to take her with them . It may be her restless voice I hear sometimes . I want to say , Warren , take her in your arms . HENRY Maybe she goes on struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're done with earth once we leave . HENRY So you take your granddaughter , and I take this boy , and we say something matters because we have this heritage . What will happen if we do n't have anyone to send it to . What if it dies with us ? GERTRUDE You sound like Columbus on his return voyage , Henry  --  HENRY Maybe you can face the wall  --  try to change it just a little . GERTRUDE ( THEY ARE BOTH STARTLED A MOMENT . ) Who  --  ? GENNY ( GENNY AND JESS ENTER . ) We had to walk back , Grandma . JESS We had to leave Warren 's car along the road . It quit on me and I could n't fix it . p. 38 HENRY We 'll pull it back with the truck tomorrow . JESS If I ca n't get it running . HENRY In the Old World we had horses  --  JESS We ca n't be of the Old World anymore , Henry . We ca n't be the New World either . I 'm a mixed blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those who have two trails to follow . HENRY There 's only one trail . JESS How do you settle for the bottom of the barrel ? How do you say , all right , in the New World you 'll take nothing and be grateful ? HENRY ( PAUSE . ) It ai n't nothing , Jess . GERTRUDE ( GENNY GOES INTO THE CABIN . JESS WALKS TOWARD THE RAVINE TO HENRY 'S CABIN . ) It 's like turning a kaleidoscope I seen at K-Mart  --  finding what pattern is there . HENRY Then just when we think we got it  --  something slips . Do our stories really matter , Gert ? Something 's always unthreading  --  GERTRUDE Of course our stories make a difference . Holy K-Mart aisles ! We are our stories ! What 's wrong with you ? I think you need to Pow Wow and regain your head  --  p. 39 HENRY I think I need to get behind a cart and push through the aisles  --  ( HENRY TAKES GERTRUDE 'S ARMS AND STEERS HER IN A DANCE STEP AS IF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SWATTER AS A WING . ) GERTRUDE Paint for the cracked steps on my old cabin , lawn chairs , hair spray , mousse , overalls , work boots , tapes of the latest hits  --  it 's where I fly in my dreams . ( THE ELK AND BEAR FOLLOW THEM IN THE AISLE. ) @x ( JESS AND GENNY ARE AT THE EDGE OF THE STAGE . ) GENNY You do n't have to loan money to have friends . JESS I feel like a jerk at school . GENNY Get used to it , Jess . JESS I always get D 's . GENNY You made the baseball team . You got Grandpa 's car running . JESS Except the other night  --  on the way back from the mall . The next day , Henry wanted to get under the truck to hitch the chain to the axle  --  I had to help him up  --  GENNY I see Grandma getting old too . JESS He wants me to go on a vision quest . That was his news when we towed Warren 's car  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to South Carolina . JESS What are they always talking about ? Thunder Beings and voices  --  GENNY And that blessed brick Grandma got from the old territory . p. 41 JESS Sometimes I 'm ready to take off to Arbuckle . They got help-wanted 's all the time for the casinos  --  they 're bringing people in buses from Texas , and all over Oklahoma . GENNY You hit a ball last game . JESS You did n't come to it  --  but you sure go to the basketball games  --  GENNY It was in the school paper . JESS I got other things to do  --  GENNY Just do n't get Grandpa 's car working enough to get Grandma back on the road to South Carolina . Now that I can drive  --  JESS Would you want to go to Arbuckle ? GENNY To deal ? JESS Or wait tables  --  ( GENNY LOOKS AT HIM . ) Whatever  --  GENNY I might go to college , Jess . They got classes now and you have to carry around a baby all week so you know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a doll . And you get a welfare check and have to budget  --  JESS Not on what dealer 's make . GENNY Next fall , we get to visit the college  --  I want something solid . p. 42 JESS What do you think gambling is ? You seen those little stones in the museum ? The ancestors been at it longer than us  --  GENNY You 're going to be like your daddy . ( JESS LEAVES GENNY SITTING BY HERSELF. ) p. 43 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE II ( HENRY SITS WITH GENNY . ) GENNY Does n't Jess know we have to finish rewriting history ? HENRY You get him riled , Genny . Keep at it . I think he 'd leave if it was n't for you . GENNY No , it 's the baseball team . HENRY It is n't what I 'm doing for him . GENNY What would he find on a vision quest ? HENRY What Gertrude thinks you 'd find in South Carolina . It 's wherever you go to find what you are  --  so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm . GENNY Who are the Thunder Beings ? HENRY Our helpers . There 's stories of them warning us of trouble  --  even stories of them laughing with us . Our stories are supposed to make us comfortable here . GENNY You got stories for everything . HENRY They connect us . Just like that brick your Grandma 's got . It 's broken like our tribe . After Removal , part of us came west to Oklahoma . Some hid from the soldiers and stayed in the east . We 're two parts , yet it 's one brick Gertrude 's got . p. 44 GENNY A burned brick . I think our stories make us uncomfortable , so we do n't get too happy here . So we 'll know something can happen to take part of us away . p. 45 Act 2 , Scene 3 SCENE III ( THE NEXT AFTERNOON . THE CRANKERS OF THE SUN ARE VISIBLE . THEN THE LARGE YELLOW BALL OF THE SUN ITSELF . PULLED BY A HAND-CRANK OVER GERTRUDE 'S CABIN . GERTRUDE SITS ON HER PORCH SEWING . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GERTRUDE Genny 's looking for you . JESS I waited for her after school . I feel like I 'm just standing around . ( HE FLOPS DOWN ON THE GLIDER . ) GENNY ( READING THE DIARY , WITHOUT FEELING . ) Later with heavy rainfall and squalls , the wind changed to the west , and I made some distance  --  GERTRUDE That restless voice I hear  --  GENNY I marked a chickpea with a cross and ordered lots be drawn for a pilgrimage to give thanks for our safety when we return . The first to put his hand in was myself , the Admiral , and I drew out the chickpea marked with the cross , so the lot fell to me . Upon return , I 'd go to Santa Maria de Loreto , where Our Lady has performed miracles  --  JESS Mr. Fax Man . Here 's the number . ( JESS DUMPS THE BOOK TO THE GROUND . ) Call Spain . Isabel , dear , I 'm coming home . Have dinner ready at 8:00 . I 've got all we ever hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PICK UP THE BOOK BUT JESS KICKS IT AWAY. ) p. 46 GENNY ( ALSO INTERPRETING , A LITTLE ANGRY NOW . ) I named an island after her . What could she know in Spain wrapped in a lace mantilla ? Sometimes I think she is Our Lady herself come back to grant my wishes to discover the New World . Maybe her delicate foot crept out from beneath her robe . The white slipper like the tongue of God . What goes on in her heart ? Does she often think of me ? So I arrived in Spain with cinnamon and pepper and spices and parrots and nightingales and slaves and gold . JESS It was chickpea park . It was kill the urth . Kill the Induns . Chop off their hands . Kill the whole fucking place . The theme-park Columbusland . The Discoverer Discovered . It was Columbus all new and roller coastery . GENNY ( FINALLY GETS THE BOOK . HALF-READING , HALF-INTERPRETING . NOW WITH FEELING . ) I wanted the Indians to know the light . God from God . Light from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe not with our understanding , but as children brought into the Father 's House to know His Magnificence . I wanted the Indians to know our example . How men in three ships could set out across the unknown and arrive in such a splendid land . How it would encourage them . How they could hear of our brave deeds . Our magnanimity . I want them to know grace and not the awful darkness they live in . Full of heathen light . Which is black as darkness itself . I wanted them to know Holiness . I wanted them to give their wealth up gladly for it . p. 47 HENRY ( HE SHOWS UP AGAIN . ) Whad ' you doing there , Gert ? GERTRUDE Working on Genny 's costume . She said I had her looking like a casserole cover  --  HENRY Har . GERTRUDE She sounded just like her mamma . GENNY I thought many times when we were loading the ships . Preparing the ship 's log .

Maybe I do n't have to do what I do n't want  --  GERTRUDE Jess  --  leave Henry alone . You do n't know what those schools were like . HENRY Do you ? JESS I ai n't been this scared  --  EVER . What am I doing here ?  --  Acting in a fucking Columbus show . I 'm an abandoned brat  --  no one ever wanted  --  GENNY  --  You 're the only one who plays the Columbus voice like you do . JESS  --  A stupid ventriloquist  --  GERTRUDE You wo n't be afraid once you start , Jess  --  JESS I got so much to say  --  GENNY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear the discomfort of school  --  HENRY It wo n't be any harder than pulling Warren 's car back with the truck .

I 'll sit with you  --  HENRY No  --  ( HE DISAPPEARS IN THE WOODS .

Warren always said  --  let Henry tell a story and he 'll get over what 's bothering him  --  GENNY Come on , Jess . You can do what you 're afraid of . Then you wo n't be afraid of it . Think of the Thunder Beings who help us . They thunder and give us courage . Once the Thunder Beings were scared of everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were little invisible children behind their parents , the Lightning . So what did they do ? They made noises . And the more noise they made , the more noise it sounded like they made . Part of their roar is in our imagination , Jess . JESS Is that one of Henry 's stories ? GENNY Just start talking like Columbus , and they 'll hear you sounding like Columbus  --  I think in his diary he was scared too  --  and maybe he felt like he did n't get what they owed him  --  p. 51 JESS He was cruel to the natives , Genny . We should hang him from the mast  --  what do you want ? Sometimes I try to talk to Henry , and all I get 's a story . GENNY He 's talking to you . You just do n't hear it yet .
