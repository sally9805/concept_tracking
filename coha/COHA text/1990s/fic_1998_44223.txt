I ONCE THOUGHT TRUST A SIMPLE EASY THING . Some evenings in autumn , when our fathers first smoked swallows from our chimney flues , reminding us of the winter that would soon descend and hem us into our homes , we would wind our way against the hills in the beds of pickup trucks , our wheels bucking through the chugholes , our arms wrapped around boys too afraid to become men just yet . But we never doubted them at Whispering Rock . After their clippers had snipped a hole in the barbed wire fence , we beat the bitterweed and creeper beneath our heels and yelled back for the boys to follow us through the wake we 'd frozen in the growth . We would stand on the edge , our dresses ballooning about our fingers , our eyes looking out toward ridgelines rimmed with lights from rival towns , afraid of the quicker deadlier distances beneath our feet . But I 'd look down . Just to see the semis skirting the base of Whispering Rock , I 'd take a glance at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my teeth . I 'd sometimes wonder if it was possible to hit Tennessee by midnight , the Gulf Coast of Florida by dawn , Pensacola , Choctawatchee Bay , Seagrove Beach , places where you need n't bundle yourself against the coming winter , where you did n't have to huddle against boys who braved your shivers with sips of rotgut whiskey . I 'd often sat with maps as a young child . I 'd imagined oceans . Bodies of water . Open . Flowing . These seas seemed tamed on the pages of my father 's atlases , though I knew no coast remained fixed beneath the rise and ebb of any tide . There I envisioned real distances , where the eye no longer seemed locked by land . Mountains were n't moved for a road like the one hammered into the valley below us . And when I thought of my father on such nights , I remembered him with eyes pinched against a blast of dynamite that rumbled through every hollow outside of Flatrock . His globe-like helmet with a silvery brim crowned his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather and his fist clenched a drill bit as thick as a swollen thumb . Since I was still young then , I thought my father a thing grand enough for fable . John Henry pounded spikes and laid railroad ties no faster than my father designed and paved a lane of interstate . Sometimes I would think maybe there lay his downfall . Because roads end . And men never live up to the myths we create around them . But their stories continue . Years later , knowing how he had opened the interstate for travellers only passing through Flatrock , opened those views that only began to hint at the size of the world , I 'd try to understand how my father found himself wishing he too could have remained a boy just a little while longer . <p> I 'm not sure what I was searching for atop Whispering Rock . The first time we snuck away from a friend 's slumber party , ditched our nightgowns and slippers for short skirts and rhinestone boots , I stood on the cliff 's edge and listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they ran wild in a pack behind us . They always wore denims , starched stiffer than boards , the legs creased as sharp as the lockblades they whetted with creek stones , which they carried against the cuffs of their cowboy boots or fastened to thick leather belts embossed with their names . Dickey Simpkins . J.D. McDermitt . Billy Service . Donny Jeter . Their names sounded like strange incantations when the wind died and we watched the syllables take shape before our lips . We howled out across the valley , listened to our echoes return from the hills . In every honkytonk , where the jukebox whined high with peddle-steels and lonesome backwoods voices , we would lace our fingers over the boys ' shoulders and watch their knives flourish above the carved tabletops and bottles of Iron City beer . Tonight my heart is breaking but I know this hurt wo n't last , Tammy Wynette sang , I wound easy but I heal fast . Even then , when we were only fourteen or fifteen years old , we understood how their show was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless bantering of each other , a crude stupid way toward winning young girls over , the freedom of their fingers to search beyond the hardened knots of our nipples . Though we understood the foolishness of such strutting , I was no less impressed by Billy Service . He was twenty then . I could hear him that first night tumbling down the sandstone , the smooth soles of his cowboy boots hissing against the slope , staking his claim to a place we girls had n't ventured to go , trying to win us over with his recklessness like the rest of the boys . Billy and I would sometimes two-step , his nickelplated flask jiggling with whiskey against his hip , its scent heavy and fired in the music that he hummed into my ear . Then I would wait for him to push me over the edge of Whispering Rock . With his palm cupping the shape of my waist , his bristled chin against my forehead , I 'd listen to the calm and delicate notes flowing from his nostrils , halfexpecting a quick cut of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flap at the folds of my dress . I 'll forgive you this time as I 've always done in the past . I wound easy but I heal fast . When he did finally thrust his whole body against mine , I felt the edge of Whispering Rock crumble under my pumps as a scream tangled deep in my throat . I knew then the fear of falling , a wild and brutal movement through my body , just as Billy 's arms provided me with the safety I 'd grown to rely on from him . Years later , I would still wonder at that strange range of emotions warring in a single instant , how I did n't know if I should be afraid of death or value life , yearn for such security or turn away from it , love Billy Service or let myself come to hate him . Or , as I would later find out , after I 'd realized that all men wish to forever remain boys , there was reason enough to believe that a less exciting place existed somewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I simply asked myself , how could my father moving mountains compare to the way Billy Service made me feel while standing on the edge of one ? <p> Roads , he would tell me , are paved in possibility . My father 's hands seemed giants . There were afternoons when I searched over those massive fleshing slabs , tracing the lines drawn across his palm , slipping my fingertips between his knuckles , searching out the firmness of bone below the veins channeled against his skin . Startled birds seemed loosed in our car . While I watched his fingers flutter above the dashboard , eclipsing the sunlight in quick fists , I would try to listen to my father talk about the interstate 's progress as we drove over the many miles he had destroyed that month . But I often found myself lost among his topographical maps and core samples . I would rattle through that box of rocks , hold the stones up to the window one by one , squinting , the shale or granite blurring against the naked face , disappearing in the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed by my father 's explosions . We drove north . I would sit in the back seat and unroll maps on my lap and hold them open with the heels of my palms . I followed the car 's course through dry washes , below hogbacks , over the lips of ridges . Yet when I glanced at the land around us , I saw that the world beneath my fingertips had simply disappeared . I then began to understand my father 's power to change the world around us . At home most nights , he would sit above drafts of his maps and chart out the possible courses that the interstate may take through these hills . He 'd listen to the gospel hours on his radio as he did his work . Hungry voices from midnight preachers would float through our heating ducts , crawl along the walls between the clapboards and plaster , haunting my sleep like trapped and famished ghosts . After creeping from my bed , I would crouch and listen for my father 's mutterings in the hot gloomy breath exhaled from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our voices seemed low and scented with fragrant incense , hidden behind the static-cracked passion of the Baptists , the Pentecostal brimstone and fury , the preacher 's calling from the pulpit , the congregation 's response from the pews . Forgive me , Lord , I wanted to say to my father , for I have sinned . And then , whispering against the grillework , he would absolve me of my many horrible deeds or cast me among the devils buried deep within the furnace fires . <p> With a drafting compass , I would trace arcs and circles in the landscapes of the maps just like those drawn by my father 's hands . A cross marked the place where the dynamite was detonated , where hills buckled under themselves , collapsing as if flicked to bits by the finger of a disinterested God . I penciled in places I wanted destroyed . A hollow where my tenth grade geography teacher lived . A dry creek bed where Billy Service first took off my clothes and piled them on the sandy banks . The dentist 's office where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I imagined the empty spaces I could create around Flatrock , I listened to my father build bridges and overpasses along a thin ribbon of road running south . The interstate , he said , would open the whole western corridor of the state , creating a direct artery between Flatrock and the state capital . There would be new motels . Restaurant franchises . Exxons and SuperAmericas . Industrial parks . Flatrock , he swore , would profit . I wondered then if these changes were what my father had meant when he used the word possibility , what he envisioned as he sat up well past midnight and charted destruction across the landscape . I know Billy Service sometimes had as much hope for the interstate as my father . Those nights I waited for silence from my father 's radio , listened by the grillework for a click that would break the final hymn , I would slip out of the dark quiet house and fling pebbles against the screen in Billy 's window . We would lie wrapped in a blanket atop Whispering Rock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer an echo , yet still wild and ever-present as I breathed it again and again into his ear . Save his cowboy boots , Billy would stand naked and lean over the edge of the cliff . He would piss against the distant blacktop , laughing at the big rigs roaring through the night . Someday , Billy would say , your daddy 'll finish this damn road . And I 'm looking forward to it . Afraid of the thread of light beginning to bleed across the eastern ridge , I 'd dress without giving much thought to what Billy said about the interstate 's progress . Maybe Billy believed he would finally find permanent work in a prospering Flatrock . Or maybe he already foresaw my father losing his own job after his contract with the Department of Highways ran out . Or maybe Billy even saw the finished interstate as a way to escape Flatrock , leaving me here to wonder what had happened to our lives in this small town . But no matter what he had meant , Billy made me believe that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the word possibility . <p> But those afternoons we wound through the mountains , travelled the undeveloped section of old State route 50 , I already had my doubts about the limits of my father 's imagination . His maps remained bare and unmarked there , in those rugged highlands populated by vegetable stands and tackle shops , lean humorless mountain-folk who inhabited sheet-metal trailers stranded against the slope , hocking everything from nightcrawlers to Silver Queen corn , honeydew melons to hand-tied flies . There were general stores where you could buy silhouettes of Elvis burned into cedar plaques and tapestries of Jesus at the Last Supper . A black bear wearing a dress decorated with small mirrors and German silver would pirouette when she heard the rattle of a quarter inside her locked tin box . When we stepped into the stale air of these cramped and dusty stores , I would bury my hands up to the wrist in trinkets and beads , run my fingertips over baskets woven with dried honeysuckle vine , scratch my back with a corn cob attached to a sumac branch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childlike again . Leaning against the bumper of his car , my father would lick a hand-dipped cone and watch the winding blacktop climb out of the valley and into the first pines . These roads were hazards , stretches of pavement where there were often rock slides , big rigs tipped in curves and lumber trucks tumbling over the shoulder , drunk driver flung among the scree settled beneath the steep jagged cliffs . I sometimes believed my father could never find a way to lay his interstate through these far reaches . But driving home those afternoons , I would watch where the winding lanes finally widened , split then into two major arteries , and I 'd somehow know that nothing could hold back my father 's road . A Baptist chapel and cemetery closed in wrought iron still sat nestled on a knoll between the north and south routes . Those nights when I did n't sneak out to see Billy Service , when I lay on the verge of a deep sleep , yet found myself casting out thoughts like nets on calm waters , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through me and imagine men breaking ground in that small solemn plot beside the chapel . A cross lay in the grass . And while I could n't know if those men were laying caskets in the ground or exhuming bones from rotten coffins , if I heard the pounding of hammers or the long slow note of nails pried from boards , I feared the cross itself simply lay on a knoll my fingernail traced in a place I had believed my father could never touch . <p> Billy Service dangled one hundred feet above the interstate and left our mark across the face of Whispering Rock . Before the boys wrote " WHISKEYBENT &; HELLBOUND " with a gallon of stolen lucite , before they began hanging over the edge just to test their courage , Billy lowered himself with a rope against the naked granite and painted a line from a Dolly Parton song . Then I felt the lonely coming down , I would read as we headed south , passing Flatrock 's single exit , the sign of the new motel looming bright against the darkened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rival towns . We would skirt those far rugged reaches of the county , places where I had once gone to watch high school football games , where I 'd snuck under the bleachers with a boy my own age , kissing him with lips chapped by the autumn chill . Billy and his friends would talk about their own games from four or five years ago . When we passed interstate signs for towns like Red Jacket and Sandy Gap and Mussel Shoals , they would talk of last second touchdowns and fumbles and tackles that could have saved conferences championships . There was glory in their voices . They believed no one could ever come to touch them . Pulling onto the berm of the interstate , cutting off the headlights , the boys would bolt up to one of the signs and spraypaint obscenities meant to defame the places we had all come to hate . RED JACKET I Mile . I 'd watch silhouettes of the boys play against the sign 's reflective green , read about distances that could bring little anticipation to most travellers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we held with such towns had something to do with trophies gathering dust in display cases , I had only then begun to understand that we hated such places for far more than lost football games . We saw towns like Red Jacket and Sandy Gap in ourselves . We saw Flatrock in those out-of-the-way places that played a second-run movie for a whole month , that fell quiet on their warped front porches on Sunday afternoons , that whispered from ear to ear quicker than the delivery of the daily mail . And we also saw my father 's lost promises right off those exit ramps . Where the land ran flat , plotted for development along service roads , there were dark empty stretches that reached back toward the hills and hollows . And then sometimes I 'd think that we had been lucky . Flatrock had at least gotten its new motel . <p> With my first cigarettes trailing comets ' tails , my long auburn hair thrashing across my face , I would huddle in the bed of the pickup truck and wait for the straight lengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed driven from the hills . In an evening of travelling up and down the interstate , we would pass a dozen brutal kills cluttered along the road 's shoulders . Clutches of deer would rise above the guardrail in fluid movements , their dark hooves clacking like creek stones against the blacktop . Bucks would seem more ghost than flesh , made of smoke and a tangle of bramble-like antlers , floating whole and alone , though somehow twinned in twos above the road , their eyes gold and mesmerized in our headlights . I 'd watch does sculpted in the high beams as if waiting for death . And I 'd think of my father then , the way he had reshaped this landscape , changed its contours for the interstate , leaving these wild animals prey to speeds reaching nearly eighty miles an hour . When I felt the swerve of the truckbed and the howling lurch of the brakes , I 'd wonder yet again about my father 's ability to create a sense of emptiness in certain places . I could no longer hear him mumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confessions of my sins to him as he sat hunched above his drafting table . But in the months after the completion of the interstate , my father still seemed to be more a noise than a visible presence in our house . At three or four in the morning , I would hear the cloc of his putter and the whisper of his golf balls as they hissed across our living room carpet . His idle hands would ruffle through the coupon drawer for bargains on soaps and canned soups , draw a clatter of hammers and screw drivers from a cardboard box kept beneath the leaky kitchen sink . And there was now the sound of different maps . Listening for the crispness of the new Rand McNallys my father had bought at the neighborhood filling station , I 'd hear a quick flap of paper as he shook out the huge sheets like laundry to be clipped on the line . I 'd hear the dry chatter from the corners as he spread the maps across his lap , then closed the folds with a slow methodic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softened folds , opening up the sheets hushed by their use , I would run my fingertips along the artificial borders that had worn perfect rectangles into the state of West Virginia . My eyes would snake along my father 's road , making me wonder if he saw these maps as a testament to the permanence of his imagination . Or , I would sometimes think , maybe he saw his failure in those red lines that represented the last days of his contract with the Department of Highways . But then , as I placed the stack of maps back where I 'd found it , I would consider yet another possibility to what my father saw in those charted landscapes . I began to believe he may have seen promise in the names of those northern cities , the fact that he had created the quickest path in which to get to them . Flatrock , I believed , would become a memory for us . <p> We would come up on a straight stretch of road those nights , the boys bonging on the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking out across the sky for a slice of moon or a cluster of stars . There were evenings when the ridgeline glowed with a red crescent or a waxing gibbous . Constellations bloomed through the bruisecolored darkness . I would hope for any kind of light . I would think that the quiet held in the sky was enough , that its openness was all I needed to end the restlessness driven through me . I 'd imagine Billy and me close and alone , lying in a meadow lined with stone fences , the sod kicked up by the hooves of horses . We would remain still and staring above us until the dew had settled in the folds of our clothes and seeped against our skin . And though I huddled against Billy those nights in the truckbed , I knew the boys were intent on pushing themselves into wilder places than I could ever imagine . When I heard the truck 's engine kick and rev , tasted the solid compact speed against my teeth , I would know a moment of regret and wish I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple evening of listening , a house where I could somehow understand the space , knowing that particular place by the creak of a loose floorboard beneath my father 's step , the last crackling ember that extinguished inside his pipe . And then the pickup truck 's headlights would suddenly cut out . Driving along that stretch of pavement , I would watch the interstate disappear and hear the boys yawp and howl out from around me in the truckbed . Our tires would sputter over the grooved shoulder , hiss against the grassy sloped median , which would send us swerving violently back up onto the smooth pavement . The boys refused to brake . They drove and drove . As I counted to myself for the pause it gave my breath , the boys would see who could drive the longest into the night without the use of the headlights . I wanted to believe the numbers mumbled under my tongue could somehow hide me from Billy 's recklessness . And yet , just for a moment , when my mind slipped between the spaces of my counting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrill stakes its greatest claim . There were nights we drove so long and so fast that I thought we 'd never make it back to Flatrock . <p> We saw the drive-in 's last show for the season . In early autumn , against the rapid coppering of dusk , we sat among the dust and crickets and watched the reels flicker through two final hours of suspense and romance . My bare thighs stuck to the vinyl seat . My father knuckled the dashboard . I licked butter from my thumbs . Chomping popcorn from a striped white box , I looked through the windows of muscle cars and pickup trucks and watched couples entangle against the fogging glass . Do n't , my father finally whispered , do n't ever let me hear of you making such a display of yourself in public . One evening as he bent above his maps , my father traced the interstate beneath his pencils and held the fate of the drive-in . I believed then that he could still keep me safe . A quarter inch to the left of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playground underneath it . But the drive-in remained . And I would continue to go there , where I dangled my bare feet beneath the swing , tracing circles in the dust with my toes , digging out cool places in the patches of grass with my heels . The slide glistened silver against the screen 's flicker and held the warmth of the whole day . Enemies and lovers reflected in the polished metal . After I 'd made sure no one around me was looking , I 'd slip my shirt up along my back and lie against a heat which seemed as compact and tight as a fist . My spine absorbed the warmth . I ached under the final touch of the sun . When I first met Billy Service there , he promised not to push me too high . But as I rose between the taut creaking chains of the swing , reached with my fingers through the dark , I hoped he would send me up into that shimmering body of light projected across the sky . I wanted to cast my shadow against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distant scenes , where actors pretended love was worth dying for and life was filled with excitement , where endings brought resolutions and realizations , making sense of all the plotting that had preceded it . There was a sudden buckling of the rusted links . I believed I might fall . With my legs still quaking , I felt Billy Service steady me in the seat of the swing . I came to rest , my body as motionless as stone . The movie ran on . That night , we did not watch . <p> A few miles south of Flatrock , where the interstate girdled the hills and skirted the hollows , Billy would pull over against the shoulder and lay blankets in the nettles beyond the guardrail . I would always wonder if my father had planned the magic in that stretch of road , that sudden breaking up of the night , that fire-like flicker opening against the hardwoods . From a distance , the drive-in 's screen seemed nothing more than a brilliant blur of colors . But as you drove closer to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark . I 'd wonder about truckers and other late-night travellers , if they were mesmerized by such a sudden moment of drama , drawing them away from their quiet private thoughts , allowing them a quick and fleeting glimpse into other people 's lives . What would they make of a woman weeping through her makeup , a man slipping his oxford cloth shirt over his shoulders , a couple collapsing together beneath the beacon-like flash of a motel 's neon ? What would they carry away from those fragmented moments of people so unlike themselves as they headed north on the interstate and beyond the town of Flatrock ? I too would try to make sense of the silence . From our spot beyond the guardrail , Billy Service and I would watch the mime-like movements of the actors and create our own stories for the men and women passing across the screen . I made the men grand . I found purpose in their brutalities . In the world I created , I could find an easy way to explain actions that seemed baffling from a distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands along my ribs , my hips , below the elastic band of my panties . Why do you figure a man would do that ? Because , I 'd say , my whisper drowned out by semis roaring north along the interstate . Just because . <p>
