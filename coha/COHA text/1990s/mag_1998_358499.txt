The words in the headlines seemed vaguely familiar : OPEC meeting , oil output curtailed , prices rising . But if you are having haunting visions of long lines and $2.50-per-gal. gasoline , relax . When representatives of oil-producing countries meet in Vienna this week , they will try to avert the disaster that was arising because prices have been collapsing . Asia 's stalled economies and a very warm winter have cut oil consumption way below what was projected for 1998 . Result : a 50% plunge in oil prices from early 1997 , to $13.31 per bbl . And with storage tanks brimming , the price looked poised to fall even further  --  to $10 per bbl. , or lower . <P> The world 's oil exporters were suddenly looking at a loss of revenues that could have exceeded $100 billion . That 's enough petrodollars to get otherwise reluctant countries to negotiate , including OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Venezuela , and non-OPEC Mexico . Their plan : cut back production to firm prices . And OPEC 's tried-and-true remedy may work again . News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barrel last week . The market response indicates confidence that the exporters will make their cuts stick . And if they do n't , prices will fall again . <P> But this is a deal no one wanted to make . Saudi Arabia , the world 's largest producer , did n't care to cut production in support of prices only to end up merely making room for others to capture its business . Venezuela , on a high-octane drive to double production within a decade , was not about to cut back unless non-OPEC countries shared the pain.That insistence reflects reality : OPEC accounts for only 55% of total world crude-oil exports . In fact , the second largest exporter is nonmember Norway . <P> What a change from a little more than a year ago , when many expected a tightening oil market to send prices soaring above the $25-per-bbl. level that oil then commanded . How sweet is it for motorists , then , to have enjoyed gasoline prices that , adjusted for inflation , are lower than at any time in memory  --  and lower than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices of the past few days , should they hold , will add only 5cents to 10cents per gal .  --  still keeping retail gasoline prices near their historic lows . <P> What could generate such a turnabout in our petroleum fortunes ? The industry has changed fundamentally since previous oil shocks that seemed to portend ever higher prices . Oil is coming into the market from every corner of the globe . Current exploration hot spots include the newly independent nations around the Caspian Sea and offshore West Africa . This diversification acts as an insurance policy against supply disruptions . The growing role of natural gas in the overall energy mix provides a further buffer . Information technology has also allowed the industry to search for oil and make a profit at $15 per bbl. , about half the threshold of just a decade ago . For example , the industry has adapted the computer-visualization techniques Hollywood used in movies like Jurassic Park for 3-D seismic visualization of potential reserves deep underground .                 @ @ @ @
