Patriotic Indians and Identities of Revolution // What , then , is the American , this new man ? HECTOR ST . JOHN DE CREVECOEUR Letters from an American Farmer ( 1782 ) " What is an American ? " asked St. John de Crevecoeur before // the Revolution , and the question has been repeated by every // generation from his time to ours . // HENRY NASH SMITH Virgin Land : The American West as Symbol and Myth ( 1950 ) // When he was appointed the king 's surveyor-general and assistant governor of New Hampshire in 1730 , David Dunbar promised zealous enforcement of the Mast Tree law , an ordinance requiring him to claim trees suitable for ships ' masts for the Royal Navy . During the forty-odd years preceding Dunbar 's appointment , lax enforcement of the Mast Tree law and similar regulations had become status quo in New Hampshire . Local residents developed a system  --  juries that refused to indict or convict , paper townships created to evade private property restrictions , political manipulation , and threats of violence  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dunbar 's concern for renewed enforcement stemmed not from any deep devotion to the lapsed laws , but from his desire to embarrass a political rival , Governor Jonathan Belcher . Not coincidentally , his most serious enforcement efforts took place in Exeter , a town controlled politically and economically by the Gilman family , long-standing Belcher supporters . // In 1734 , Dunbar sent a party of men to enforce the Mast Tree law on the residents of Exeter . Midway through their meal at the town inn one evening , the party heard whoops and screams . The inn 's door slammed open and a file of men entered and headed directly for Dunbar 's table . The intruders wore blankets wrapped Indian-style and sported caps and feathers on their heads . They had blackened and painted faces , and they grimaced and brandished clubs at the frightened group . When one of the stunned victims tried to speak , an Indian clubbed him across the shoulders . As the king 's men mounted a feeble resistance , war clubs rained down upon their heads . Bruised and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whooping and howling , made for the door . // If Dunbar 's men thought that the Indians ' exit marked the end of the evening 's excitement , they were gravely mistaken . Their assailants remained outside the public house , screaming curses , epithets , and threats . Concluding that they were still in danger , the men fled out the back door and down to their boat , only to find that the sails and rigging had been slashed . They pushed off into the harbor anyway , hoping to find refuge offshore . Perhaps they breathed a collective sigh of relief as they floated away from the howling throng gathered on the shore . Soon , however , the party realized that their vessel was taking on water , the Indians having punched a hole in its bottom . They drifted ashore downstream and spent the rest of the night in hiding . Doubtless , during their hike back to Portsmouth the next day each was reevaluating the relation between zealous backwoods law enforcement and personal safety . // The Dunbar encounter may be the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was certainly not the last . In 1768 , for example , the Boston Evening Post carried a similar story : // We hear from the eastern parts of this province , that there have lately been disputes relating to the right of lands between some Claimers and the Possessors , which are very common in those parts : That a month ago at Woolwich a person there having built a house , about 20 or 30 men disguised in an Indian dress , came upon him , and drove the people out , and they pull 'd the house down ; and afterwards threatened to serve some others in the same manner . // In the years before the American Revolution , colonial crowds often acted out their political and economic discontent in Indian disguise . The Boston Tea Party has given the practice its greatest notoriety , but white Indians attacked other tea ships as well , and they kept a tight watch on activities involving tea . When a tea vessel did manage to land south of Boston the following spring , Samuel Adams wrote with disgust that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Marshpee tribe would have been so sick at the knees , would have marched on Snow Shoes ... to have done the business for them . " In New York , Mohawks wrote strident editorial letters to the newspapers and everywhere plastered handbills warning against the purchase or drinking of tea . Indians turned up frequently in political cartoons and in humorous yet pointed proclamations such as the one penned in January 1774 by Tea Party participant Edward Proctor ( fig. 1 ) : // From the Chief Sachem of the Mohawks ... and Lord of all their Castles : To all our liege Subjects  --  Health . // Whereas Tea is an Indian Plant , and of right belongs to the Indians of every land and tribe ... We do ... permit and allow any of our liege Subjects to barter for , buy , or procure of any of our said English Allies , Teas of any kind : PROVIDED always each man purchases not less than Ten nor more than One hundred and fourteen Boxes at a Time , and those the property of the East India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Said Tea into the Lakes , Rivers , and ponds , that while our Subjects in their Hunting instead of Slaking their Thirst with Cold Water , as usual , may do it with Tea . // Confronting political and economic incursions against established status quos , eighteenth-century New Englanders often adopted traditional European methods of social protest , resurrecting the blackfaced disguise and the violent ( but rarely murderous ) crowd reprisals that characterized Old World traditions of misrule . Whether aimed at British officials or colonial landlords , misrule traditions , often performed in Indian dress , remained a vital mode of American political protest for more than a century . // In the middle colonies , other Americans began dressing as Indians for different reasons . While David Dunbar 's men were confronting hostile white Indians in New Hampshire , the members of the Schuylkill Fishing Company of Pennsylvania may have been preparing Indian costumes for the May first frolics that opened their club 's sporting season . According to club lore , its fishing and hunting grounds had once been the territory of Tamenend , a Delaware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and woods . The Schuylkill club inspired the formation of similar clubs in urban areas of the middle colonies , the Chesapeake , and the seaboard South . Each group gathered on May Day for dinners that featured songs , tobacco , a huge dinner , and prolific toasting with bowls of potent alcoholic punch . May first was proclaimed King Tammany 's Day , and , to celebrate the return of spring , revelers sponsored maypoles , dances , vigorous speeches called longtalks , and Indian-costumed parades. // After the passage of the Stamp Act in 1765 , increasingly resistant colonists gleefully promoted Tammany from king to " tutular sic saint of America " and turned their May Day songs and revels into overtly politicized demonstrations of patriotic Americanness . The Indian saint 's supposed motto , Kwanio Che Keeteru , used formally by the sporting club as early as 1747 ( as the inscription on a cannon ) , became  --  both in and out of translation  --  a patriotic slogan of the Tammany societies : " This is my right ; I will defend it . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canonized Tammany and the American continent for which he stood . Long before William Penn 's arrival , the American saint had battled with the devil for possession of the land , successfully hunted the most dangerous of animals , nurtured peace in the council chamber , and performed a host of other noble deeds . Growing aged , Tammany refused to burden his family but instead put his lodge to the torch and reclined peacefully inside , perhaps destined to rise again someday . As they imagined and then appropriated this phoenixlike figure , the white members of the societies sought to stake their claim on an essential Indian Americanness. // European antecedents lay closely beneath the surface of these two prerevolutionary traditions of playing Indian . In the middle colonies , bacchanalian parties and patriotic literary fictions recalled the costumed excesses of European holiday festivals . In the North , disguised riot , effigy burnings , and tar-and-leatherings evoked Old World misrule traditions . The two traditions  --  carnival and misrule  --  are intimately connected and , indeed , often blend seamlessly together . Both sets of rituals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , questioning authority . // While recognizing the traditions ' common roots , I would like , nonetheless , to treat them separately in order to help clarify the distinctions between New Hampshire and Pennsylvania and between the Old World and the New . What I shall refer to as carnival was associated with specific occasions  --  holidays and market days , for instance  --  although the inverted world of carnival consciousness could appear at any time and was a significant element in misrule rituals . What I shall call misrule , although it often occurred in the context of specific holidays , had an aggressive , critical quality that could be mustered at any time to protest transgressions of the social order . Taken together , manipulated by colonists , and transformed by the infusion of Indianness , misrule and carnival offered proto-Americans a platform for imagining and performing an identity of revolution . Such an identity was assembled piece by piece at events like the Exeter riot and the Tammany dinners , and it found its most compelling expression at the Boston Tea Party . // Carnival , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most visible to Americans as Mardi Gras . But carnival originated in the Middle Ages as a longer , transitional festive season . It encompassed the time between the celebrations of Christmas , which were based upon the solar calendar , and the Easter holidays , which marked the meeting of the lunar calendar and the spring equinox . During the carnival season , hearty overconsumption of meat and drink emphasized fertility , wild abundance , and the physical functions of the body . Carnival celebrations traded in humor , disruptive behavior , street theater , processions , disguise , gender reversals , death , regeneration , and the symbolic overturning and inversion of established social orders . In France , for example , at the Christmastime Feast of Fools a choirboy might become a bishop and preside over a burlesqued mass . Mocking paraders might dare to haul an ass through the church . The major sponsors of such festivals were fraternities of young men called Abbeys of Misrule , and they organized themselves around holiday hierarchies of inverted offices : the Prince of Improvidence , the Cardinal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Grand Patriarch of Syphilitics . In England , holidays featured blackface , transvestism , and costume , the parading of figures in live or effigy form , and the pots-and-pans clamor of " rough music . " // By the sixteenth century , urban men 's societies  --  previously defined by youth and marital status  --  began to cluster around occupational affinities and social distinctions . Increasingly , festival inversions critiqued not only social but also political orders , mocking magistrates and officials and sometimes providing the occasion for armed uprisings . The line between street party and insurrection could blur with alarming rapidity , the semantically linked words rebel and revel smearing together in the collective mouth of an unruly crowd . Carnival worked transformative magic , however , even in the absence of armed insurgence . The temporary experience of life as something other-than-what-is infiltrated and permeated the life that was , transforming both . // Carnival , according to the Russian critic Mikhail Bakhtin , represented a second life , a different consciousness that transcended the everyday . In the festive practices of the common people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being that questioned the rationalized administrative power of the state . As both specific holiday ritual and generalized consciousness , carnival broke down boundaries , demonstrating the commonalities between upper and lower classes , law and custom , food and flesh , past and present , civilized and savage , birth and death . It replaced all forms of rank and hierarchy with a boundless utopian freedom . Over time , the impact of these different consciousnesses might painstakingly transform the larger structures of a society . // The confusing of boundaries made carnivalesque holidays perfect markers for the simultaneous beginnings and endings of cycles of time  --  years , mourning periods , planting seasons , periods of denial , rites of passage . Such cycles often ended with the ritual death of a royal figure representing the past year , the older generation , the accumulated evil . This sacrifice required celebration , for only through such an overthrow could the new cycle be born . On May Day , for example , European revelers danced around the maypole  --  an ancient symbol of the unity of the old sacrificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of one cycle and the beginning of another , but also the oneness of the old year and the new . They frequently burnt the old king and used fire and ash symbolism to evoke the phoenixlike connection between death and new life . Along with the maypole , celebrants held dances , strewed flowers and boughs , wore blackface , and performed mummer 's plays , in which costumed actors would break into a gathering , perform a skit , and then take up a collection . Copious food and drink recalled the abundance of the past and invoked the fertility of the future . // At the same time that this second life awakened participants to future possibilities , however , it reaffirmed the social systems that structured the nonfestive world . The humor in a mocking church parade owed much of its power to the looming presence of a real parade of powerful bishops and clergy . Carnival presented its celebrators a doubled vision of the world : on the one hand , anarchic possibility ; on the other , affirmation of the status quo. // American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these older European traditions ( fig. 2 ) . Endowed with kingly control over American fecundity , the mythic Tammany served as the counterpart of the traditional May fertility king . " It is usual on the morning of St. Tammany 's day , " noted one account of a Chesapeake Bay celebration , // for the members of the society to erect in some public situation in the city , a " May-pole " and to decorate it in a most tasteful manner , with wild flowers gathered from the adjacent woods , and forming themselves in a ring around it , hand in hand , perform the Indian war dance , with many other customs which they had seen exhibited by the children of the forest .... A large company usually assembled during the course of the evening , and when engaged in the midst of a dance , the company were interrupted by the sudden intrusion of a number of the members of " St. Tamina 's Society , " habited like Indians , who rushing violently into the room , singing the war songs , and giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . After which ceremony , they made a collection and retired well satisfied . // The maypole , floralia , and costumed mummers were all familiar European holiday practices , claimed now as the supposed American customs of the " children of the forest . " The Tammany societies also celebrated the death of the Indian saint as the overthrow of an aged fertility figure . In Charleston , South Carolina , Tammany followers reenacted his mythic end by literally setting him on fire : " At about 4 o'clock they sat down to a plain and plentiful dinner , and after imbibing a suitable quantity of Indian drink proceeded to the solemnity of burning the Old Chief , who being placed in the Wigwam and having sung the death song , fire was set thereto and the whole immediately consumed . A dance , after the Indian manner , concluded the ceremonies of the day . " // When Indian-garbed proto-Americans wound around the maypole , they celebrated not only the departed Tammany , but also his heir apparent  --  themselves . The rituals worked in countervailing ways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of Indian people from the land , the destruction of the old cycle , the dawning of another era in which successor Americans would enjoy their new world . His implied rebirth , on the other hand , suggested that Americans were not successors so much as aboriginal Tammanys themselves . And if the new ruler was literally the same as the old , it was only fitting that the Tammany members share his identity by clothing themselves in Indian garb . // While Tammany rituals enacted the displacement of Indians , they also relied upon reborn Indian Americanness to question the British identity that the empire would have preferred to see among its colonists . John Leacock 's comedy The Fall of British Tyranny ; or , American Liberty Triumphant ( 1776 ) captured this mixture of nascent American political identity , spring fertility ritual , and doubled consciousness as it coalesced musically around the carnival theme of abundance : 1 Let Hibernia 's sons boast , make Patrick their toast , // and Scots Andrew 's fame spread abroad , // Potatoes and oats , and Welch leeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , my brave boys . 2 In freedom 's bright cause , Tamm'ny pled with applause , // And reason 'd most justly from nature ; // For this , this was his song , all the day long ; // Liberty 's the right of each creature , brave boys . // 3 The strong nervous deer , with amazing career , // In swiftness he 'd fairly run down ; // And , like Sampson wou 'd tear wolf , lion , or bear . // Ne'er was such a saint as our own , my brave boys . // 4 On an old stump he sat , without cap or hat , // When supper was ready to eat , // Snap , his dog , he stood by , and cast a sheep 's eye ; // For ven'son 's the king of all meat , my brave boys . 5 Like Isaac of old , and both cast in one mold , // Tho ' a wigwam was Tamm'ny 's cottage , // He lov 'd sav'ry meat , such that patriarch eat , // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
