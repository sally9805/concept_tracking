<p> " My silence seems to confirm every accusation and fantasy , " the poet Ted Hughes once wrote , referring to his fierce , decadeslong refusal to discuss his relationship with Sylvia Plath publicly . " I preferred it , on the whole , to allowing myself to be dragged out into the bullring and teased and pricked and goaded into vomiting up every detail of my life with Sylvia . " <p> Now that Mr. Hughes , 67 , has spoken out , discussing Plath for the first time in a stunning new volume of poetry , he might be forgiven for hoping that the teasing and pricking will finally end . But judging from the early response , his book , " Birthday Letters , " seems unlikely to quell the insatiable interest in the author 's doomed marriage to Plath , whose suicide at the age of 30 turned her into a tragic feminist icon and cast him , in the eyes of many , as her executioner . <p> " If he really wanted peace , he would n't have published this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is chairwoman of the women 's studies program at Smith College , Plath 's alma mater . " I think it 's going to stir everything up all over again . ' <p> The publication of " Birthday Letters " was kept a deep secret in the notoriously leaky publishing world because The Times of London , which bought serial rights from the British publisher , Faber &; Faber , wanted to protect its investment and be the first to publish the news . The surprise announcement generated uncommon interest , at least in a book of poetry  --  the American publisher Farrar , Straus &; Giroux instantly sold its entire first printing of 25,000 copies  --  and forced a revisiting of all the old debates , where lines are drawn , roughly , into two opposing camps . <p> On one side , led by feminist critics at American universities , are those who believe Mr. Hughes wronged Plath in life by abandoning her , and in death by too carefully controlling publication of her work . On the other side , led by a coterie of extremely protective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been vilified by hostile strangers unjustly picking over the details of his life . <p> In recent interviews , several American critics said they were fascinated by " Birthday Letters , " but disappointed by the way Mr. Hughes seems to have portrayed Plath 's suicide as inevitable . This speaks to one of the main questions about the Plath-Hughes marriage : Was she so unstable and so obsessed with her dead father that her suicide was almost predetermined , or did his behavior , particularly his decision to leave her for another woman after six years of marriage , push her over the brink ? <p> " My initial response was that this was just amazing and spectacular , " said Elaine Showalter , a professor of English at Princeton University , speaking of the book 's publication . " I was completely stunned , and I think the poems are very important and very remarkable . " <p> But as she began to read the 88 poems , Ms. Showalter began to have a second reaction : " I 'm seeing how much he mythologized the relationship and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it was because of her father , and that she was doomed to die and there was nothing he could do to stop her . <p> " I do n't believe in this kind of determinism . I do n't believe she was doomed to die . I do n't believe that for a minute . That is not to say that Ted Hughes drove her to suicide , but it seems to me that it was a tragic match , a very tragic romance that just comes to a violent end . " <p> Lynda K , Bundtzen , a professor of English at Williams College , who is working on a book about Plath 's " Ariel " poems , said Mr. Hughes 's new poems were particularly interesting because they seem to mimic Plath 's style , because so many are direct responses to Plath 's own poetry and because many events to which Mr. Hughes refers are described in Plath 's journals and letters . <p> " The poems say very much about what he felt at the time , " Ms. Bundtzen said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if he can talk with her . I find it very moving . " <p> But Mr. Hughes fails to answer crucial questions about the months leading up to Plath 's death in February 1963 , Ms. Bundtzen said , questions that may never be resolved because Mr. Hughes later destroyed the crucial final volume of Plath 's journals , saying he wanted to protect the couple 's two children . <p> For example , Ms. Bundtzen asked , what happened in October 1962 , when Mr. Hughes , having left Plath for the other woman , came back to their house to remove his belongings , and Plath wrote some of her famous " bee poems , " highly allegorical works about their fraught relationship . <p> " For a biographer , this was a crucial time , " Ms. Bundzten said . " What happened between the two of them , what decisions did they make ? The poems do n't seem to say much in the way of offering biographical evidence about what actually happened , or clarifying any of the questions that biographers have asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his critics ' questions about minute details of his long-ago life ? To many of his friends and fellow poets , the answer is a resounding no . <p> " I think he was more interested in writing the poems than in presenting his side to anyone else , " said the poet A. Alvarez , whose published recollections of Plath 's last months drew criticism some years ago from Mr. Hughes . " They 're complete in themselves and full of feeling , and the feeling seems wonderfully authentic . " <p> Tom Paulin , a poet and friend of Mr. Hughes , said he had watched for years as Mr. Hughes was attacked by strangers who , for instance , repeatedly hacked the name " Hughes " from Plath 's gravestone . Critics also used to disrupt his poetry readings with shouts of " murderer ! " And Robin Morgan , the American poet and feminist activist , wrote a poem called " The Arraignment , " which began , " I accuse/Ted Hughes . " <p> " It 's a terrible thing to watch a writer being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal life , " Mr. Paulin said . " Writers , and especially poets , think that Hughes has had the roughest ride imaginable , something that nobody deserves . " <p> " There 's a great sense in the literary community that this is a definitive and authoritative statement , " he continued . " This great tragic statement is here , and it says to his enemies , ' This far shalt thou go , and no further . ' " <p> What has Mr. Hughes done to inspire so much anger ? Leaving aside the tragedies that seemed to suffuse his early life ( Assia Wevill , the woman for whom he left Plath , killed herself and their 2-year-old daughter five years later , using gas , as Plath had done ) , he has been most criticized for tampering with Plath 's work after she died , even as he benefited financially from it . Editing of Journals Called Unforgivable <p> When he published her last and most famous volume of poems , " Ariel , " for instance , he omitted the poems that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , he edited passages out of Plath 's journals before publication , destroyed the final volume , and said he had lost another volume of journals and an unfinished novel . <p> " That to me seems unforgivable , when she was such a great writer , " said Ronald Hayman , author of " The Death and Life of Sylvia Plath . " " He 's destroyed her side of the story , literally wiped out history . " <p> Mr. Hayman and numerous other Plath biographers have met an adamant wall of resistance from the Plath estate , which until recently was controlled by Mr. Hughes and his formidable sister , Olwyn ( the copyright to Plath 's work is now owned by the children of Plath and Mr. Hughes , and by Faber &; Faber ) . Although Mr. Hughes has argued that he wanted simply to prevent untruths from circulating  --  " I hope each of us owns the facts of her or his own life , " he once wrote  --  Plath scholars complain that his meddling went much further , to the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at times , the literary merits of both Plath and Mr. Hughes . Plath , who wrote a burst of brilliant poetry in the astonishingly productive months before she died , won a posthumous Pulitzer Prize for her " Collected Poems " in 1982 . Mr. Hughes , Britain 's poet laureate since 1984 , won the Whitbread Prize for poetry this year for his latest collection , " Tales From Ovid . " Why Publish Now ? Theories Vary <p> Critics are divided on the artistic merits of " Birthday Letters . " " It 's an extraordinary book , a great book , " Mr. Paulin said . " It 's like walking on ice , reading it . " <p> But the American author and critic Joyce Carol Oates said the Hughes poetry " lacks the originality and sharpness of Plath 's poetry . " <p> She continued : " It 's a testament to the power of what we might call contemporary biographical mania , that our interest in this capable , conventional poetry would only be stirred by our collective prurient interest in the poets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question about " Birthday Letters " is why the intensely private Mr. Hughes , who lives in Devonshire with his wife of 28 years , Carol , decided to publish it now . Although Mr. Hughes has declined to give interviews , his publisher said he wants to close what has surely been an almost unbearably painful chapter in his life . <p> " The poems speak to me about how he needs to understand Plath 's death , " said Ms. Van Dyne , the Smith professor . " These poems are the fiction that Hughes as a survivor has needed to create over the last 35 years . " <p> The British author Blake Morrison said that when he spoke to Mr. Hughes several years ago in a rare newspaper interview , the two discussed Mr. Morrison 's latest book , a confessional memoir about his late father , and the poet talked about how writing about the death of someone you loved " might give you some control over the demons that were haunting you . " <p> At the time , Mr. Morrison said , Mr. Hughes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his poems about Plath . " It 'll be interesting to see whether having got this out , he feels able to relax now with the biographers and the critics , " Mr. Morrison said . <p> " I think he 's been tortured , but I think he 's begun to feel a little bit more confident and relaxed in the last few years , " he added . " People who know him have always felt this tremendous disparity between this vilified figure and the person that they know . But what can you say , if he 's not speaking for himself ? <p> " But now he has spoken , and people will see his side of the story . "
