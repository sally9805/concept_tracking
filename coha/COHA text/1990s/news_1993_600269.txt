<p> Ford CEO Harold " Red " Poling does n't like to give anything away - in the showroom or on the golf course . <p> Consider what happened two years ago when Poling played 18 holes with President Bush . Bush teed off , only to have his ball land in a sand trap . A more casual businessman might have told Bush to take a mulligan and try again . Poling made Bush swing from the sand . " I do n't play ' customer golf , ' " he says . <p> Poling 's competitive streak is one reason Ford is the USA 's healthiest and most profitable automaker , despite some looming problems . The first quarter , Ford 's net income soared to $ 572 million , or $ 1.02 a share , double what Wall Street predicted . And its stock , lately a favorite of big investors , has doubled to $ 55 1/2 since 1991 . <p> Today , as he presides at his final annual shareholders meeting , Poling , 67 , can point to a string of successes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck sales has jumped nearly two percentage points this year to 25.7% , highest since the 1960s . <p> - Ford makes six of the 10 top-selling cars and trucks . The F-Series pickup is the top-selling vehicle . And the Taurus surpassed Honda 's Accord in 1992 to become the best-selling car . Ford Explorer is the best-selling sport-utility vehicle . <p> - Ford has the lowest production costs and best labor relations of Detroit 's Big Three . It spends $ 800 less to build a vehicle than General Motors and $ 200 less than Chrysler , according to a study by Harbour Associates . Ford has n't been struck by the United Auto Workers in more than 15 years . <p> The next two years , Ford will roll out 14 new or restyled cars and trucks , including a minivan dubbed Windstar , Mondeo family sedan , midsize F100 pickup to battle the Toyota T100 and Dodge Dakota , and a sleek Mustang styled like the jazzy Mach III concept car that 's raised a ruckus at auto shows this year . <p> That lineup , coupled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Ford 's share of the U.S. car market could match GM 's within years . GM 's share was 46% a decade ago and is about 33% now . But Ford executives dismiss the idea . " Even if we ran overtime all night , we could n't outsell them , " says Ford President Alex Trotman , possible heir to Poling when he retires later this year . ( GM , despite its wave of plant closings , can build 6 million vehicles a year , vs . Ford 's 3 million . ) <p> " I do n't think ( Ford ) wants to be the lead company in this business . They want to be a strong No. 2 , " says David Cole , director of the University of Michigan 's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation . Yet it 's clear that stealing sales from GM , Chrysler and foreign carmakers is one of Poling 's priorities . Asked to list his goals for Ford this year , Poling first cites gaining market share . He also hopes to improve quality and customer satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine is running smoothly . But under the hood , there are a few knocks and pings that worry some Ford watchers : <p> - Bank-breaking costs . It took Ford six years and roughly $ 6 billion to develop Mondeo , a compact sedan launched in Europe in February . That 's the most any carmaker has spent to develop a car . Taurus cost $ 3 billion ; Chrysler 's LH sedans , marketed as five different cars , cost $ 2.5 billion . Mondeo will join Ford 's U.S. lineup in spring . <p> " ( Mondeo 's $ 6 billion ) is a lot of money , " Poling says . Ford says the money was well-spent because it paid for a range of engines and transmissions for U.S. and European Mondeos . <p> - Shortfalls in quality . Ford has cut defects on new cars 70% since 1980 . But no Ford scores above average in recent surveys by J.D. Power and Associates , which measures customers ' happiness with cars a few months after purchase . <p> Part of the problem is that Ford 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked with the carmaker the past decade . Poling predecessors Philip Caldwell and Donald Petersen made quality improvement Ford 's No. 1 priority in the 1980s . Poling played a key role as head of North American Operations and , later , president . The effort drew on employees ' ideas to improve the way Fords were built , the features they offered and the processes used to make them . Employees came up with 1,401 suggestions to improve the Taurus . Poling insists quality is still Job 1 . " You can never stop , " he says . " I do n't think you ever reach a point of 100% perfection . " <p> But Bill Scherkenbach , a quality consultant who worked closely with Ford in the 1980s , says Ford 's focus on eliminating defects and cutting costs is n't enough to make its cars as good as the best Japanese and European models . These days , good quality is more than just removing defects , he says . " You have to add positives , " such as sleek styling , quiet engines and modern-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to brag . " <p> Ford showed it can be a styling leader with its aerodynamic Taurus . But Ford has n't shattered the mold in a while . Chrysler stole the styling spotlight this year with its rounded , sloping LH cars - Dodge Intrepid , Eagle Vision , Chrysler Concorde , LHS and New Yorker . <p> Poling also has become an outspoken critic of Japanese trade policy . He is pushing the federal government to sue Japan 's carmakers , charging them with dumping cars here at prices below those charged in Japan . And he is demanding that Japan eliminate its $ 50 billion annual trade surplus with the U.S. over five years . Critics say Poling 's crusade takes up too much of his time and takes the focus off improving customer service and delighting customers . <p> " Red Poling was n't hired to be our conscience . He was hired to run an auto company , " says Joan Gebhardt , author of Quality in Action . " I 'd like him to apply his expertise where it would do the most good : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bigger issue at stake : the nation 's ability to compete with Japan and protect U.S. jobs . " We do n't want to limit ( auto-buying ) choices ; . . . we do n't want to cut off imports , " he says . " It 's so frustrating ! " <p> Frustrating as the crusade might be , Poling can savor at least one political victory . He won that round of golf with Bush . <p> USA 's top-selling vehicles in ' 93 ( 1 ) 1 .
