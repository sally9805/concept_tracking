It is n't over until the fat lady sings .  --  Sports proverb <P> Well , the fat lady sang , and it 's over . When Roseanne Barr screeched an off- key version of the national anthem , scratched her groin and spit at a ball game recently , she crossed the line between comedy and crudity . For an emerging group of female laugh getters , grossing out audiences is left to the likes of Andrew Dice Clay and Sam Kinison . Coven-like hairstyles are passe ; so are Elizabeth Taylor fat jokes , delivered Uzi-style a la Joan Rivers , and the kind of masochistic self-deprecation that kept Phyllis Diller in face-lifts for two decades . The freshest funnywomen have power smiles , well-toned bodies and social commentary that ticks before it detonates . <P> " My ancestors wandered lost in the wilderness for 40 years , " says Elayne Boosler , shaking her Botticelli curls , " because even in biblical times , men would not stop to ask for directions . " <P> Rita Rudner 's wide-eyed , lighter-than-air delivery brings the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage  --  they 've experienced pain and bought jewelry . " <P> Reno , born Karen Renaud , is one of the women who pulls , pummels and stretches comedy into the field of performance art . The tornado with dark roots asks , " Remember when safe sex meant doing it when your parents were out of town ? " <P> Carol Leifer , a blond with a flexible voice and metronomic timing , complains that her ex-husband tricked her into marrying him . " He told me I was pregnant . " <P> " There 's a real reversal going on , " says Regina Barreca , an assistant professor of English at the University of Connecticut and the author of two books on female humor . " Women 's comedy used to be local and specific  --  ' Oh , look at my hair , look at my legs , I 'm so fat . ' Now male humor seems to be taking a step back to ' Take my wife  --  please , ' and women comics seem to be much more subversive . " <P> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walker , who teaches English at Vanderbilt University . Back in 1981 , Walker recalls , writer Erma Bombeck told her that more men were coming to her talks and breaking up at columns addressed primarily to women . Bombeck 's conclusion : " That means they are doing laundry . They understand that washing machines eat socks . " In the ' 90s these changes are amplified on the nightclub circuit , where 20% of the comics are female , up from perhaps 2% a decade ago . Even that minuscule group used to give itself the short end of the shtick : " When I was born I was so ugly , the doctor slapped my mother . " In comedy 's Paleolithic era , notes Budd Friedman , impresario of Los Angeles ' Improv comedy club , " stand-up was traditionally a white male enclave . But today there are no restrictions . Women are able to use their intelligence and their femininity and their strength to say what they want . " <P> What Rudner wants to say is couched in whispers and stares toward the horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very tough cookie . She buried three husbands . Two of them were just napping . " She was afraid to ! expose herself at a topless beach : " They 'd never been in the sun before . They might catch fire . "
