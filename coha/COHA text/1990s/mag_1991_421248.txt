<p> When I went to see William Reese 's latest paintings , I was surprised to discover that he had taken up etching . His handsome prints and his enthusiasm for the medium rekindled in me a dormant desire to learn the process of etching . Bill must have sensed my feelings of excitement and curiosity , for he invited me to accompany him to his printmaking studio . Little did I know that when I accepted that invitation , I was taking the first step toward an absorbing new career . Moreover , I was discovering a practical way to overcome the fears and misconceptions that many artists have about the etching process . <p> The studio we visited  --  about a two-hour commute by ferry from my home near Seattle , Washington  --  is run by Elizabeth Tapper , an etcher and master printer who consults with and prints for a number of artists . Almost immediately after we arrived , she and Bill began looking over proofs she had pulled for him the day before . Once decisions about ink color , plate tone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin a new drawing while Elizabeth prepared to etch a plate in acid and to perform other various printmaking miracles . I tagged along , questioning everything and understanding only part of what she said . When it was time for her to pull a print after running it through the press , Bill and I stood by with great anticipation , almost afraid to breathe as the new print was born . The excitement was intense . Seeing the dampened paper slowly peel away from the zinc and seeing the print emerge a fraction of an inch at a time  --  well , that was it ! I had to etch . <p> Sensing my desire to try the process myself , Elizabeth sent me home with two small , prepared plates ( sheets of zinc covered with coats of liquid ground ) and instructed me to return the plates with my etchings on them , adding that I should protect them from accidentally becoming scratched . She would then etch them in acid and pull proofs for me . It all seemed simple enough . <p> However , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about putting any mark on that first piece of unblemished zinc . I simply stared at it , just as I have stared at gessoed canvases and at blank sheets of drawing paper . ( At least with canvas and paper I knew I could paint over the canvas or erase on paper if I messed up  --  but how was I to erase metal ? ) Finally , having selected a drawing from one of my sketchbooks , I followed Elizabeth 's instructions for making white-chalk carbon and transferred the drawing to the ground-covered plate . I bore down heavily on my etching tool to be sure of getting a strong image , wondering how long my fingers could tolerate the pressure . <p> That was my first error . I dug down so deep into the surface of the plate that I actually engraved it . Elizabeth said I had done the work of the acid ! Only a light touch of the needle , enough to draw through the ground to expose the zinc , is necessary ; the acid does the actual etching . The drawing process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper  --  easier , because the etching tool does n't run out of ink or catch on anything that might cause it to splatter ink as a pen would . <p> Sometime later , I spent two more afternoons with Elizabeth , working on a fairly simple line etching . I made the etching by first completing a detailed sketch , transferring that to a prepared plate , scribing the lines of the image through the ground onto the plate , and them putting the plate , and then putting the plate into a tray of dilute nitric acid  --  all under the watchful eye and supportive hand of Elizabeth . If you are interested in learning how to etch , I strongly recommend that you find someone who can perform the same valuable service for you . <p> In the meantime , I read everything I could find about etchers and etching . Then , armed with some knowledge and experience , I began intensive work in an independent study course in the art department at a local school  --  Olympic College in Bremerton , Washington . At that point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a bone . <p> Encouraged and helped by studio partner Irmgard Brusser and art instructor Imy Klett , I experimented with various printmaking techniques and established a repertoire that allowed me to create the images I wanted . Generally , I adhere to the more traditional etching methods in which the line dominates , because I have a real passion for drawing ; however , I often add tones or textures with sugarlift , aquatint , or soft-ground . It is intriguing to experiment and to make new discoveries , if only to stretch the medium to its limits and to take it over the edge to where the unexpected might happen . <p> The knowledge that results from these experiments has enabled me to make choices that can enhance a particular technique . Sugarlift and aquatint , for example , two intaglio techniques , can be used together , one enhancing the other . The sugarlift involves making a drawing with a sugar solution on the bare metal plate . A ground is then applied , protecting the plate from the acid except in areas where the solution was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acid . ) <p> Austrian Pine , which is reproduced on the opening pages of this article , was made with both sugarlift and aquatint techniques . For the sugarlift , I used a mixture of powdered sugar , India ink , and water , with which I painted the pine limb using a No. 10 watercolor brush . That was done on an pristine zinc plate ( no ground had been applied ) . Being nervous about working on such a large plate ; feeling intoxicated by the fragrance of pine , which came from my subject ; being buoyed by the pleasure of creating on the spot ; and seeing the finished piece evolve before my eyes all contributed to the high energy of this work . <p> When the sugarlift was partially dry , I brushed a liquid ground over the entire plate , let it dry , and then immersed the plate in hot water . In half an hour , the sugar began to dissolve , lifting off the ground and leaving a silver image of a pine limb . I then created an aquatint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( The aquatint process allows you to create areas of tone rather than line . You cover an area of the exposed plate with a texture , fine or coarse , which you control by using either rosin dust or spray paint . ) I immersed the plate in the dilute nitric acid for five minutes and then washed it with mineral spirits , soap , whiting ( a white powder ) , and water . <p> I inked and pulled a trial proof of the plate to determine what the print needed and decided to add different textures to the background . Again using the spray enamel , I applied it minimally to the upper right-hand area of the plate and gradually applied more dense coverage toward the bottom to create the final dark-to-light tone . ( This technique is a variation from rosin aquantinting . ) The areas that I wished to keep unchanged from the first proofing I covered with blockout on top the spray enamel , and the plate was then resubmerged in the acid bath . <p> All the variables worked well in this piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the timing , and the temperature of the acid ; the happy accidents ( splotches ) resulting from spraying the plate with paint and enamel ; the inking and wiping of the plate ; and the correct adjustment of the press . Even the special paper I used was properly damp . The whole printmaking process depends on good timing and " choreography , " and for this piece , it finally came together . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : The first of three stages in the development of an etching . At this point , I have etched the lines of my original drawing onto the metal plate . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Next , I used a technique called sugarlift to establish the branches and leaves of the plant . I painted directly on the bare metal with a solution of powdered sugar , India ink , and wiser ; then I coated the entire are . with liquid ground ; and , finally I soaked the plate in hot water so that the painted sugar solution would dissolve and lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my design was painted . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : After the plate was cleaned and proofed once again , I used an aquatint process to apply more texture to the plate to darken the appearance of some of the frogs . <p> The completed print : Frog Haven ( Tree Frogs ) , 1989 , aquatint and sugarlift , 12 x 14 .
