Section : SOCIETY AGING <p> As women of the baby boom head into their 40s , menopause is losing its embarrassing stigma , and gaining recognition as a critical health issue <p> For women who came of age during the 1960s and later , the intricacies of their reproductive lives are as familiar and comfortable as the layout of their reproductive lives are as has remained shadowy and unexplored. menopause . " Mothers do a good job teaching little girls about menstruation , " says Dr. Cynthia Stuenkel , medical director of the Comprehensive Menopause Program at the University of California , San Diego . " But they do n't talk to their daughters about menopause . " It 's the only phase of the female cycle that chatty women rarely chat about  --  even among themselves . And with good reason : what little they know of it sounds pretty grim . Hot flashes , the weeps , chin whiskers  --  who would want to discuss it ? <p> Hot topic : These days the answer is , suddenly , everyone . Menopause , which refers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 and 55 ; the average age of onset is 51 . In the next two decades , more than 40 million American women will enter their 40s , and already menopause is emerging as the woman 's health topic of the ' 90s . " It 's finally coming out of the closet , " declares Sonia Hamburger , founder of the Menopause Clinic in San Diego . The cast of " The Golden Girls " can be seen in a public-service TV spot describing the first major government-funded study of this middle-aged rite of passage . Just launched by the National Institutes of Health , the three-year , $10 million Postmenopausal Estrogen-Progestin Intervention trial will chart the effects of various hormone treatments on menopausal women . In recent years , a dozen menopause clinics have sprung up around the country , and Dr. Wulf Utian of Cleveland 's Case Western Reserve University has founded the North American Menopause Society . A cluster of fact-packed new books has appeared , from the feminist-oriented " Menopause , Naturally : Preparing for the Second Half of Life " by Dr. Sadja Greenwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide by Utian and Ruth Jacobowitz . <p> " The change " has always been a frightening topic . Before the 20th century , shorter life spans meant that menopause was usually followed in fairly short order by death . But today , most women can expect to spend fully a third of their lives postmenopausally . And though many suffer physically and emotionally , others sail through the transition with minimal angst " Contrary to myth , menopause is a natural event in a woman 's life , " says Diana Laskin Siegal , 58 , feminist co-author of " Ourselves , Growing Older ; Women Aging With Knowledge and Power . " <p> In fact , a body of new research indicates that contemporary women do n't find menopause the soul-wrenching experience it was for their mothers . A study reported last month by University of Pittsburgh psychologist Karen A. Matthews found that women who had recently gone through menopause did not have higher levels of depression , anxiety or stress than women of the same age who were still menstruating . Sonja and John McKinlay , epidemiologists at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted a five-year study examining the health of midlife women . In a random sampling of 2,500 Massachusetts women , age 45 to 55 , they found that three quarters of the participants felt either relieved or neutral about menopause . Only 3 percent viewed it negatively . " For the majority of women , " says John McKinlay , " it 's no big deal . " <p> And yet , biologically , menopause is a I very big deal . The drop in the body 's production of the female hormone estrogen affects some 300 different body functions . The hormonal decline usually begins gradually , at 36 or 40 , but women at any age can undergo an instant and especially intense menopause as the result of chemotherapy or surgical removal of the ovaries . About 1 percent of women have a natural menopause before the age of 40 . <p> Whether it happens early or later , many clinicians consider menopause a potential disease state . " The ovary is an endocrine gland , and when you lose the function of that gland , problems develop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and director of two Cleveland menopause clinics . Most menopausal women face two serious health hazards : increased risk of heart disease and the rapid bone loss that leads to osteoporosis and hip fractures . Then there are the immediate and tangible symptoms that range from the mildly annoying to the devastating . The list is headed by the notorious hot flashes , often resulting in disturbed sleep patterns ; 67 percent of women experience them for more than a year , and 25 percent for more than five years . Other distressing occurrences include thinning and drying of the skin ( which , in the vagina , can make intercourse painful ) , incontinence and urinary infections , deepened voice and facial hair , impaired touch perception , loss of libido , reduced short-term memory , mood swings and sadness . <p> In a small percentage of women , estrogen levels taper off quite slowly after menopause . Their bodies partially compensate for the loss by converting the male hormone androgen ( present in all women ) to estrogen . And because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but not all  --  overweight women are at an advantage . " A woman who is a little Rubenesque is less likely to get estrogen-deficient osteoporosis than a skinny woman , " says Utian . <p> Hormonal help : For the vast majority of menopausal women who have a more rapid decline in estrogen , several kinds of help are available . The most effective treatment is hormone-replacement therapy ( HRT ) , usually given as a regimen of estrogen and progestin , a synthetic form of another female hormone . Studies show decisively that estrogen , both with and without progestin , can stave off the ravages of osteoporosis-an important benefit , since one of every five older women with a fractured hip dies from complications within a year . Other research suggests that HRT can cut the rate of female coronary heart disease in half . <p> HRT is also the only really effective treatment for hot flashes . Dr. Lila Nachtigall , director of the Women 's Wellness division in New York University 's department of obstetrics and gynecology , tells of a patient who had 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disheveled from her repeated sweats , " she looked like a bag lady , " says Nachtigall , until hormone therapy dramatically improved the woman 's appearance and spirits . <p> As many as 70 percent of menopausal women could benefit from HRT , but federal health officials estimate that physicians are prescribing it for less than half of them . Many women shy away because of the ongoing medical debate over whether HRT may increase the risk of breast cancer . The issue is not entirely resolved , but most well-regarded studies have shown either no link or a lower cancer risk in women on HRT . ( A 1989 Swedish study that did find an increased risk has been criticized for imprecise methodology . ) Some breast cancers are estrogen-dependent , Nachtigall notes , and thus could be stimulated by HRT . But she does not believe the therapy initiates the development of new tumors . The risk is negligible in women who take the hormones for 10 years or less , says Dr. Brian Walsh , director of the menopause clinic at Brigham and Women 's Hospital in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Women with uterine or breast cancer , for example , should n't take it  --  and others do n't want to because it brings back their monthly periods . Some doctors think HRT is overprescribed . But most women who try it are enthusiastic . Joan Karol , 68 , of Brookline , Mass. , had severe hot flashes , night sweats and depression . She has been on HRT for 14 years and says , " If anybody told me I had to go off it , I 'd be totally devastated . " <p> For women who ca n't take estrogen , there are some new alternatives . Recently , researchers reported in The New England Journal of Medicine that a drug called etidronate can dramatically reduce the incidence of vertebral " compression " fractures that commonly result from osteoporosis . There 's also an over-the-counter vaginal gel called Replens that creates a film of moisture when inserted with an applicator every three days . <p> More physicians now realize that the menopausal woman needs to be treated holistically  --  not , says Utian , " just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diego 's Sonia Hamburger , women " usually do not get seen above the navel . " But at the Comprehensive Menopause Program in San Diego , Stuenkel provides total medical care , spending an hour with each patient , evaluating her history , symptoms and psychological status . Hamburger runs fourhour workshops and encourages women to phone her on what she calls the " hot flash line . " She gets a dozen calls a month , mostly from frantic patients struggling with a new symptom or the decision whether to take HRT . About 16 percent of her clients are premenopausal and simply want to be prepared for what to expect . <p> Early age : Premenopausal preparation is one innovative approach to postmenopausal health . In 1985 Dr. Morris Notelovitz , a gynecologist specializing in what he refers to as " adult women 's medicine , " founded one of the first menopause clinics to include premenopausal women : the Women 's Medical and Diagnostic Center in Gainesville , Fla . Ideally , he believes , a woman should have a thorough medical evaluation at 35 , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baseline mammogram . <p> The transition from premenopause to postmenopause is receiving serious attention from the National Institute of Mental Health . Dr. Peter Schmidt and Dr. David Rubinow , psychiatrists in NIMH 's section on behavioral endocrinology , are looking at the effect of menopause on the emotions in a group of women who have recently begun to experience menstrual irregularities . They are also examining the impact of " negative life events " that often occur during middle age , such as the empty-nest syndrome and the demands of aging parents . <p> Inevitably , the feelings a woman brings to her menopause influence how she experiences it . Hot flashes and the other unpleasant changes are absolutely real , and the tangible signs of growing older are little cause for rejoicing . " It 's tough to admit that you 're aging in a society that demands that you look young and be useful , " says Stuenkel . But the subject is now getting a welcome airing . The middle-aged women of the ' 9Os have neither the time nor the inclination to let menopause confound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read books about menopause , and some of them will write books about it . They 'll ask their doctors for the help they need  --  and then they 'll get on with the rest of the prime of their lives . Signs of the Time <p> The decline of estrogen levels in middle age can affect some 300 different body functions . How Women Change <p> No More Periods : For many women , the cessation is a welcome relief . <p> Hot Flashes : These telltale bursts of perspiration can last from a few seconds to 15 minutes . <p> Dry and Thinning Skin : When it affects the vagina , this symptom can make intercourse painful . <p> Sleep Disturbances : Because hot flashes often happen at night , they can interfere with adequate rest . <p> Psychological Effects : Depression , anxiety and emotional fragility can occur , but may be due to the many other stresses of middle age . How Women Cope <p> Hormone-Replacement Therapy : The treatment relieves hot flashes and reduces the risk of osteoporosis and heart disease . <p> Support Groups : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exercise : Calcium-rich foods and exercises like jogging and cycling help prevent bone loss . <p> Vaginal Lubricants : Estrogen creams and a new nonprescription product keep dry tissues moist . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> JEAN SELIGMANN with DEBORAH WITHERSPOON in New York , NADINE JOSEPH in San Francisco and LAUREN PICKER in Boston <p>
