<p> At 5 o'clock on a rainy afternoon , three days before Christmas , Rockville Pike offered its familiar mixture of frustration and exhaust fumes . For block after block , six lanes of cars and buses inched their way from traffic light to traffic light  --  a jumble of commuters heading home and shoppers out to spend their cash along one of the East Coast 's premier commercial thoroughfares . <p> Washington area residents already know " the Pike " as a roadway so dense with shopping centers that it 's virtually a retail mall for the automobile , with bumper-to-bumper backups in every season . Yet in Rockville and elsewhere in Montgomery County , the road known as Route 355 is only going to get busier . <p> Up and down this artery , planners and developers envision an explosion of new development  --  enough construction to duplicate Bethesda 's dense , high-rise downtown . From the District line to Germantown , more than 10 million square feet of commercial projects and thousands of homes have been proposed or approved or already are being built . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last farm along the way . When it 's all done , there will be few remaining empty spaces on a road already bursting with shops , restaurants , apartment buildings , office towers , gas stations , hotels and car dealers . <p> This is no accident . The building blitz is the culmination of a decades-long effort by Montgomery officials to build an urbanized strip along Route 355  --  known by several names , including Wisconsin Avenue in the south and Frederick Road in the north-  --  in order to preserve other parts of Montgomery for quieter suburban communities and farmland . That goal has been supported by the County Council and the Planning Board , with County Executive Douglas M. Duncan ( D ) one of the biggest cheerleaders nowadays . <p> But the addition of more metal and concrete is not without controversy . The people who live nearby are becoming increasingly concerned , asking how many more people , cars and buildings can be squeezed onto the road . They fear that too much growth could bring major headaches such as gridlock and lesser irritations such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affluent suburbs . <p> While Volvos and Toyotas already crowd many stretches of Route 355 on weekdays and weekends alike , more construction will only add to the congestion , residents fear . In North Bethesda , volume may jump 7 percent a year , according to one estimate . More than 76,000 cars a day now jam the intersection at Montrose and Randolph roads , a key crossroads where state engineers foresee 91,000 cars a day by 2020 . <p> The basic worry , shared by civic leaders and some county officials , is whether this road can handle such a load , especially given sharp cuts to roads budgets in recent years . Such doubts have delayed approval of the North Bethesda conference center and have led to some of the most heated Planning Board meetings in recent history . <p> Yet such is the attraction of Route 355 that developers keep coming , eager to be connected with the activity and the crowds , the cachet of Wisconsin Avenue and the prominence of the Pike . And local officials have so far welcomed them , arguing that economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contend that proper planning and improvements to roads and mass transit will accommodate the increases in traffic . <p> " What you really have here is a suburban jurisdiction coming of age , " said Stephen Z. Kaufman , a lawyer with the land-use firm Linowes and Blocher , which represents clients in about a dozen projects on Route 355 . " You have to start looking at Montgomery County as a city , and these places  --  Rockville , Bethesda , North Bethesda  --  as its commercial neighborhoods . This road is a linear downtown . " <p> The numbers are already huge . With 23 shopping centers in just six miles , Rockville Pike has nearly enough retail space to fill two Tysons Corners . A Washington Post analysis of data provided by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments found that 38 percent of all jobs in Montgomery County  --  more than 178,000  --  are located within this mile-wide corridor . <p> On the Drawing Boards <p> COG forecasts that the corridor will have 205,000 jobs by 2005 . Meanwhile , these projects will be completed or underway : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the District line as Wisconsin Avenue , officials are set to approve 2 million square feet of retail and office space , nearly doubling what is there now . <p> Bethesda is facing what could be its biggest building boom in 10 years . Four more office and residential high-rises are proposed along Wisconsin Avenue , and Chevy Chase Land Co. has broken ground on the 15-story Newlands Building at the Bethesda Metro Center . <p> At the White Flint station in North Bethesda , Metro has signed on with LCOR Inc. , of Pennsylvania , for the transit agency 's largest joint development effort ever . Preliminary plans show a $ 350 million office and residential community on 32 acres on the east side of Rockville Pike . Across the street , cranes signal an 18-story residential building just south of the county 's proposed $ 60 million conference center and 225-room hotel complex . <p> A new retail pavilion with a 13-screen movie theater and restaurants is under construction on the site of the demolished Rockville Mall , which failed after closing itself off to the Pike . Future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornfields of the King Farm have been plowed under for the last time to make way for Rockville 's biggest development ever . More than 3,200 condominiums , town houses and single-family houses and 3.1 million square feet of office space will rise on Route 355 's last vestige of rural Montgomery south of Germantown . <p> In Germantown , 20 miles up the road from the D.C. border , the huge Milestone community will be home to about 2,000 families . It will feature a 900,000-square-foot retail center boasting the region 's biggest concentration of " big-box " department stores , such as Wal-Mart and Target . <p> The Rural Will Become Suburban <p> Eventually , development will continue into now-rural Clarksburg , where the road is still only one lane in each direction . Fewer than 2,000 people live there now , but the county has plans for 44,000 people in 20 years . <p> Land-use consultant Malcolm D. Rivkin , who has clients up and down the East Coast , considers Route 355 , particularly Rockville Pike , among its elite suburban strips . <p> " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former Planning Board member and adviser to White Flint mall when it was built in the late 1970s . " The fact that this is such a money machine is reflected in the landscaping , and the very appearance and quality of the shopping centers . It 's something you see in very few commercial strips anywhere in the country . " <p> Today 's boom is just the latest phase of the road 's evolution . Route 355 started out as a Seneca Indian trail and became a strategic travel route during Colonial times . Armies in the French and Indian War and the Civil War used it . Pioneers followed it on their way west . <p> It is Montgomery County 's oldest road , and the county 's first to be paved . Called Wisconsin Avenue at the southern end , its name changes as it heads north , where it is known as Rockville Pike , Hungerford Drive , Frederick Road , South Frederick Avenue and North Frederick Avenue . <p> ' A Road That Works ' <p> " This has always been a central road in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of commerce . This is just the latest incarnation of that , " said Eileen S. McGuckian , director of Peerless Rockville , a historic preservation group . " It has always been a road that works . " <p> One of the biggest reasons the thoroughfare still works today is that it has its own transportation network . Metro 's Red Line and Interstate 270 parallel it to the east and west , absorbing commuter traffic and providing access to the Pike . <p> " This activity would n't be happening if you did n't have I-270 and the interconnecting roads , " said Thomas Bozzuto , whose company is building condominiums at the King Farm . Even though none are completed , Bozzuto already has potential buyers for more than a third of the 93 properties . " People want to be here because this is a great location . " <p> Retailers also are drawn for other reasons , including a well-populated and well-heeled clientele base in adjacent neighborhoods , where household incomes average as much as $ 78,000 a year . And many view the abundance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to a one-ring circus , " said Stephen L. Oseroff , vice president of GFS Realty , which recently expanded its Montrose Crossing shopping center on the Pike and opened another center in Milestone . " Everybody wants to go to a three-ring circus . " <p> Indeed , when the Dallas-based restaurant and entertainment chain Dave &; Buster 's decided to come to the Washington area , company officials did not have to look long to figure out where to go . They knew they wanted to be on the Pike , and they landed at White Flint . Their first year there brought in $ 15 million in sales and more than 1 million customers , better than all but one of their 10 locations across the country . <p> " This street is alive , " general manager Don Feinberg said . <p> But Interstate 270 and Metro have not solved Route 355 's traffic woes . Traffic in downtown Bethesda often slows to a crawl at rush hour , and north of the Capital Beltway , many intersections are at capacity . <p> " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular on Rockville Pike , has become synonymous with a curse word , " said John G. Viner , a retired research engineer for the Federal Highway Administration who lives in North Bethesda . <p> Seeking an ' Escape Valve ' <p> Viner complains that there are too few " escape valves " to either speed traffic flow to and from the Pike or connect it with other major north-south streets , which often are clogged with cars , too . " If we 're supposed to be an urban area , where 's the grid system ? " he asked . <p> North Bethesda is one of the worst trouble spots , particularly near the Montrose-Randolph intersection . Three of its corners are occupied by a residential tower and two major shopping plazas , one of which , Montrose Crossing , sports a large new addition with Barnes &; Noble and Mikasa and its own multilevel parking garage  --  a key sign of urbanization . <p> On this stretch of the road , drivers often must sit through a few red lights before they can make it through the intersection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by as much as 7 percent a year , hearing examiner Philip J. Tierney recommended that the council reject the conference center at White Flint , one of County Executive Duncan 's top initiatives . <p> To David H. Brown , Tierney 's proposal was the right one . From his 11th-floor condo overlooking the Pike at Marinelli Road , the former meeting planner and federal government retiree monitors the backups . They dictate when he drives . " If I see a lot of traffic , I 'll wait and go out later , " he said . <p> Brown insists he 's not against development . In fact , just like the retailers , he and many other empty-nesters moved to their upscale addresses along Route 355 because of location . But with the sites for an additional half-dozen projects visible from his windows , Brown wonders if the road is near its limit . " I look out on Rockville Pike right now , and I just ca n't see how they plan to do this . " <p> Local officials insist that the planned growth will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office and residential development , instead of retail , in hope of creating diverse , more pedestrian-friendly communities , especially near Metro stations . <p> Building a Support System <p> But current government budgets include no funds to build needed parallel streets and commuter rail stations , as called for in the master plan . For example , a crisis could come at Montrose and Randolph roads , which traffic experts warn could put a stranglehold on the Pike if not replaced with an overpass . Yet this $ 40 million to $ 50 million project has languished since 1984 . <p> Duncan hears residents complain about traffic and says their concerns about overdevelopment are valid . Yet in the end , he sides with growth , saying the benefits of increased revenue to support county services outweigh the drawbacks . <p> " If we can handle the traffic and some of the other concerns , then this will really be a great success story , one that I 'm sure other jurisdictions would love to have , " he said . <p> Nowhere are these issues being debated more strenuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condominiums sell for $ 700,000 and shoppers browse Tiffany &; Co. , Saks Fifth Avenue and Brooks Brothers . Developers talk about turning this section of Wisconsin Avenue into a boulevard a la Rodeo Drive , but many residents are opposed . They contend that the construction of condos should be emphasized over commercial projects because they have less impact on traffic . <p> Looking for the Right Kinds of Growth <p> " If you focus more retail in an area that already has a large amount of traffic , you 're only going to worsen the situation , " said Robert L. Cope , who leads a civic group in the surrounding single-family neighborhoods . " It means that there wo n't be any break from traffic . " <p> Council member Betty Ann Krahnke ( R ) , who represents people from Friendship Heights to North Bethesda , says the county must take a comprehensive look at Route 355 and the communities it bisects . What happens along one portion , she notes , can inconvenience tens of thousands of drivers and residents elsewhere . <p> If people begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success today could be its downfall tomorrow . <p> " The risk of having any part of this corridor not function , and how that would affect the rest of it , is just tremendous , " she said . " It would be the worst thing the county could do . "
