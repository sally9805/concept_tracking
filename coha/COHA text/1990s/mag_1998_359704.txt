Yes , yes , we 've heard it all . Cigars , hair gel , the whole political-entertainment complex of prurience . We 're Degeneration X ; nothing can shock us . So it 's almost salutary that , in a Manhattan screening room last week , a film could provoke audible gasps . Not much happens on screen : just a conversation between a man and his 11-year-old son . But because the chat is about the boy 's frustration in trying to achieve his first orgasm , and because the father is a pedophile on the prowl , and because the scene is played with the whispered solemnity of a Father Knows Best tete-a-tete , this scene goes directly to the viewer 's guts and lodges there like a twisted thrill . Imagine : in this wicked world there are still taboos , and artists with the nerve and skill to break them . <P> The film is Todd Solondz 's Happiness , winner of the International Critics ' Prize at this year 's Cannes Film Festival and already the fall 's succes de scandale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Solondz told TIME , " but it 's out there in the media every day . Celebrities are always talking about their own abuse . TV news programs discuss the atrocities of children being killed or raped . It has a freak-show quality ; it 's titillating . Still , I do n't think anybody could use the word titillating about my movie . I hope people see there 's a certain ... integrity to the proceedings . " <P> He 's right . The sick kick of the scenes in Happiness is integral to the pageant of misery and yearning  --  of the all-American pursuit of happiness , in forms simple or bizarre  --  that is Solondz 's great theme . His intent , to cleanse by shocking , is just as important . In an age of creeping movie sameness , Happiness resounds as a declaration of independence . <P> And of American independents in the ' 90s . Think of what U.S. films would be like  --  no , do n't , it 's too depressing  --  without the emergence of off-Hollywood auteurs like Kevin Smith ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flirting with Disaster ) , Noah Baumbach ( Kicking and Screaming ) , Kasi Lemmons ( Eve 's Bayou ) , the brothers Hughes ( Dead Presidents ) and Wachowski ( Bound ) and , of course , the dark lord Tarantino . They 're here to stay , but not as colleagues or competitors . " Directors like Quentin do n't need to top some other director , " says indie-film guru John Pierson . " Their fear is how to top themselves . " <P> This has been a top year for indie cinema . Fertile talents have emerged : Don Roos ( The Opposite of Sex ) , Darren Aronofsky ( Pi ) Tommy O'Haver ( Billy 's Hollywood Screen Kiss ) . Familiar renegades prove they can expand on their obsessions : Hal Hartley in Henry Fool , Neil LaBute in Your Friends and Neighbors . An old timer like James Ivory displays renewed grace with A Soldier 's Daughter Never Cries . And this fall four filmmakers who made a collective splash in 1995 and ' 96 are presenting works that offer hope for a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
