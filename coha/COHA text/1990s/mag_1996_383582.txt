Tinglazed earthenware with luster and underglaze cobalt blue decoration , diameter 16 1/3 inches . // In the mid-sixteenth century a monastery on Cyprus sheltered an unusual relic ( Pl . IV ) . The monks believed that their treasure , a vase measuring about four feet tall , was one of six jars in which Jesus transformed water into wine.l The vase , supposedly used during the biblical Marriage at Cana , was covered with intricately patterned gold bands . A single wing linked its ovoid body and tall neck , matched by traces of a second wing on the opposite shoulder . Seized as booty by the Turks when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II ( r. 1576-1612 ) . By the eighteenth century it was in Sweden , where it was believed to be a product of ancient Egypt . It had been swept up when the Swedish army entered Prague in 1648 . A Scandinavian architect did a creative restoration job before the mid-eighteenth century , adding a bronze wreath to the neck and a bronze dragon to replace the missing wing.2 In spite of the assumptions of its owners , this peripatetic object originated neither in the Holy Land nor in Egypt . Rather , it is an example of Spanish lusterware made in Andalusia in the second half of the fourteenth century . Lusterware is a type of maiolica ornamented with gold- or copper-colored decoration made from metallic oxides . Although it has been created in a number of pottery-producing regions over the years , little lusterware is the equal of that produced in medieval Spain . In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries lustered maiolica from the Iberian Peninsula was exported throughout Europe . It reached destinations as widely spread as London , Venice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered a rapid decline in the late 1400s in the face of stiff competition from the expanding Italian maiolica industry Lusterware continued to be made and treasured in Spain , but was thenceforth largely ignored elsewhere . Even today it is little recognized outside its native land . Indeed , one of the world 's great collections of this ceramic art , on permanent display in the museum of the Hispanic Society of America in New York City , is better known in Spain than in the United States . The Hispanic Society owns more than 150 pieces of lusterware , almost all amassed in less than a decade by its founder , Archer Milton Huntington ( 1870-1955 ) . The son of the railroad and shipping magnate Collis Potter Huntington ( 1821-1900 ) , Archer Huntington 's interests from adolescence onward led him toward culture rather than commerce . He was fascinated by Iberian civilization and by his early twenties he had studied Spanish , Old Spanish , and Arabic . He received honorary degrees from Yale , Harvard , and Columbia universities for an acclaimed critical translation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1907 . He also explored the arts of Spain , teaching himself bookbinding , typesetting , and ironwork . He collected Visigothic coins and books on every aspect of Hispanic culture , including many rare editions that he made accessible to others through reprints.3 Photograph Pl . III .

Nationalmuseum , Stockholm , Sweden . // Founded in 1904 , the Hispanic Society opened its doors in 1908 . The museum and library were furnished with Huntington 's immense collection of books and manuscripts and a wide-ranging selection of paintings , sculptures , and decorative arts objects . Among the most significant aspects of the art collection is the comprehensive survey of Spanish lusterware.4 The earliest lustered ceramics in the museum date from the second half of the fourteenth century From the Alhambra Palace in what was then the kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms of the Nas.rids ( PI . VI ) . The shield of the Nasrids , the last Muslim dynasty in Spain , is inscribed in Arabic " There is no conqueror but God . " It was probably also for the Alhambra that most of the great lustered vases were made , including the example thought to have been used for the Marriage at Cana . A few of the vases still stood in the garden of the palace in the seventeenth century , but others were broken or dispersed after the fall of the Nasrids in 1492.5 The neck from one vase ( PI . X ) is given an almost architectural authority by the application of ribbed moldings and a rim punctuated with rounded arches . The Islamic motifs found on fourteenth-century lusterware , such as interlacery and geometric and vegetal designs , are a reminder that luster technology was a Near Eastern invention . Along with the opaque white lead-tin glaze used on maiolica , luster decoration seems to have appeared first in ninth-century Iraq . The luster pigment is prepared from a mixture of silver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then ground to a powder . This is then ground with a pliable clay such as red ocher and the resulting pigment , sometimes refired first , is liquified with vinegar . The clay object is first fired to a biscuit state . It is then dipped in lead-tin maiolica glaze and fired for a second time . The third and final firing , following the application of the luster with a brush , takes place in a smoky reducing kiln . The atmosphere , development , was often combined with luster Painted on the biscuit before the object was dipped in opaque white glaze , the cobalt migrated to the surface of the glaze during firing.6 By the thirteenth century the main sites in Spain for the manufacture of lusterware were Murcia , Almeria , and , by the end of the century , Malaga.7 This last center , in the kingdom of Granada , became so closely identified with the production of lusterware that merchants and buyers alike generally referred to the ware as obra de malica ( Malaga ware ) . The name persisted even after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the production and export of lusterware by the beginning of the fifteenth century . The term is probably at the root of the Italian word " ma aY " The Buyl family , which ruled Manises in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries , has been credited with bringing the lusterware industry to Valencia . In the winter of 1309-1310 Pere Buyl ( d. 1323 ) visited the kingdom of Granada on a diplomatic mission for King Jaime II ( r. 1291-1327 ) of Aragon . He may have been inspired by the Alhambra 's treasures to begin making lusterware in his own lands , possibly with the help of at-as brought from Malaga . In any case , lustered objects were being exported from Manises by 1325 , and by the end of the century the little Valencian town was famous for its ceramics.9 Already in 1383 the chronicler Eximenus cited the gold pottery so splendidly painted at Manises , which enamours everyone so much , that the Pope , and the cardinals , and the princes of the world obtain it by special favor and are astonished that such excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal patron was Maria of Castile ( 14011458 ) , the wife of Alfonso V ( the Magnanimous ; r. 1416-1458 ) , king of Aragon and Naples . In 1454 she wrote to Pere Buyl V asking him to obtain for her a set of lusterware " for the use and service of our person . " Among the pieces she requested were platters , bowls , plates , flower vases , and water pitchers . ' The Hispanic Society 's collection includes a particularly impressive group of fifteenth-century lusterware objects from Manises , representing all the major decorative patterns of the era.12 Islamic motifs prevail in pieces dating from the first third of the century , such as a deep bowl made about 1400 ( PI . HI ) . Tree of life designs radiate from a central eight-pointed star while the intricate patterns circling the inside edge of the bowl are stylized abstractions of Kufic script . Four small lugs , arranged equidistantly around the brim , help the user retain a firm grasp on the bowl and emphasize the sturdy potting that underlies the decorative surface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In-glazed earthenware with luster and underglaze cobalt blue decoration ; height 11'h6 ( left ) , 12 5/8 ( center ) , 11 1/4 inches ( right ) .

V ) . Stripes , other abstract designs , or imitation Kufic lettering are arranged in horizontal bands . Made without lids until the mid-eighteenth century , albarelos were often covered with cloth or parchment secured around the neck with a string . In the early 1430s Gothic painting and decoration began to influence Spanish lusterware . The effect is seen primarily in a growing repertory of naturalistic plant and animal motifs , such as the heraldic eagle shown in Plate VII . Ornamenting the back of a round tray , the bird is set on a ground of plant tendrils and leaves . The eagle was a popular motif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the century This artist played with the theme by inserting a rabbit in the birds stomach . Smaller birds or animals also appeared on Spanish ceramics in the 1430s set amidst dots , tendrils , and sprigs of parsley-like leaves . This type of lusterware is known as the " Ave Maria " series because the words " Ave Maria gratia plena " ( Hail Mary full of grace ) are sometimes part of the decoration ( see PI . I ) .

The same plants , in conjunction with ivy leaves , appear on the albarelo shown at the center in Plate XI . This piece closely resembles a lusterware jar bearing lilies in Hugo van der Goes 's Portinari Altarpiece ( Pl . VIII ) . The Flemish artist 's choice of the albarelo to hold a flower emblematic of the Virgin hints at the value placed on imported lusterware by northern European connoisseurs . Flanders ( in what is now Belgium ) was by no means the only foreign market for Spanish ceramics . The deep dish shown in Plate XII bears the shield of the Guasconi family of Florence . Plant tendrils wind around the central circle and then radiate outward on the body of the dish . A lustered flower vase in the British Museum in London belonged to the Medici prince Piero ( the Gouty ; 1414-1469 ) of Florence , the father of Lorenzo ( the Magnificent ; 14491492 ) . Made in Valencia about 1466 , it bears the five gold balls of the Medici arms on one side and Piero 's personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on lustered tiles from Manises . In 1446 he ordered 13,458 of these tiles for the Castel Nuovo and the Castello di Gaeta in Naples.13 As late as 1494 , when Italian maiolica production was already thriving , a visitor to Valencia reported that the export market for lusterware remained strong : Entire ships are sent loaded with this product to Venice , Florence , Seville , Portugal , Avignon , Lyon , etc. ; accordingly the potters dedicated to this work are extremely numerous.l4 The lusterware made in Spain from about 1470 through the turn of the century shows a change in decorative aesthetic . Naturalistic vegetal designs are replaced by smaller diaper patterns , such as those found on a plate made in Manises for the Poblet Monastery in Catalonia ( PI . XIV ) . The decoration includes encaje ( lacework ) , the wheel pattern ( reserved in white on a luster ground ) , and the sofa ( musical note ) design , which is found in the band encircling the shield . Other wares of the period have features derived from contemporary metalwork , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , these motifs became increasingly formulaic after 1500 and seemed out-of-date next to the polychrome narrative scenes painted on Italian pottery . Innovation in Spanish lusterware during the sixteenth century came not from Manises , but rather from Aragon and Catalonia . The potters of Muel in Aragon produced particularly attractive tablewares in the sixteenth century ( see PI . II ) . Their work often features large-scale floral motifs , which seem to have developed from smaller Islamic designs related to those used in Malaga two centuries earlier A brush with two points was employed to delineate contour lines and plant stems , and asymmetrical patterns were sometimes favored . Production in Aragon virtually ended with the expulsion of the Morisco craftsmen from Muel in 1610 and 1611 . In Catalonia , lusterware such as the plate shown in Plate XIII was made throughout the seventeenth century The wide , gently rounded boss of the plate is a typically Catalan feature , and the motif of the Maltese cross was favored in the Catalan city of Barcelona . The luster dashes on the background are arranged in curves that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and echo the shapes of the teardrops separating the arms of the cross , subtly enhancing a seemingly simple pattern . On the back of the plate the pink ceramic body shows through the white glaze . Catalan glazes were generally less rich in tin and therefore not as opaque as those made in Aragon or Valencia . Italian influence , particularly strong in Catalonia , inspired designs with bust-length figures , especially in Reus . The profiles of soldiers alternate with the arms of Pope Paul V on a pair of jars that may have been a gift to the pontiff ( see   . XV ) . They are rare examples of seventeenth-century lusterware with armorial bearings . In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries only a few attempts were made to produce elaborate lustered ceramics . The ceramic factory of Alcora in the province of Castellon experimented with luster decoration on faience . However , most potters making lusterware at this period created inexpensive tablewares or small religious objects for the home . In Manises , holy water stoups and plaques of the Virgin were popular ( see   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with crested , long-tailed birds . The reddish tone of the decoration came from the high copper content of the luster pigment . The significant admixture of silver required for gold-colored luster was too expensive for the local clientele . Craftsmen in Manises preserved the secrets of making lusterware into the the modern era . In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries there was renewed interest in the luster technique as part of a more general revival of historical styles in arts and crafts . The Hispanic Society owns several pieces of lusterware from the beginning of this century that look back proudly to Spain 's glorious medieval past .

However , the pervasive use of the term obra de malica ( or maliqua , ua , malega , maleca and other variations ) to signify lustered ceramics offers a more convincing etymology . 9 Pedro Lopez Elum , Los origines de la ceramica de Manises y de Paterna ( 1285-1335 ) ( Valencia , Spain , 1984 ) , pp. 51 , 55-57. 10 Quoted in Juan F.
