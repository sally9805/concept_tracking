<p> Runoff election results <p> The ship carrying those self-appointed Hispanic leaders who have always claimed that a Hispanic can not get elected in a City Council at-large position has just taken another hit - from which it will not recover - fired by a boat led by Orlando Sanchez and his supporters . ( Sanchez won the at-large City Council seat in Saturday 's runoff election . ) <p> I trust we have heard the last proclamation from them on this subject . Please understand that we are ready to welcome those of that group who now wish to come and join us . <p> Al Veka , Houston <p> In the City Council runoff election , Bob Todd literally tore up Andrew Burks Jr . in the District E race . The results were 63 percent to 37 percent , or basically two to one . <p> The Chronicle headline writers chose to ignore this rout and use the Page One headline , " " Sanchez , Boney win council bids " ( Chronicle , Dec. 10 . <p> Orlando Sanchez won by a minuscule margin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16.4 percent . <p> Would it have been that difficult to have - as a minimum - the headline read , " " Sanchez , Boney and Todd " ? Do I sense some favoritism ? Or worse ? <p> Larry Jambor , Houston <p> With Jew Don Boney on Houston City Council , there will be a hot time in the old town tonight . <p> Congratulations , Jew Don . I know you wo n't be a rubber stamp for anybody . <p> Jimmy Dunne , Houston <p> Many thanks for the manatee <p> As a member of the " " manatee mud wrestling team , " I thank the Houston community for all the support , cooperation and encouragement we received during our recent encounter with the West Indian manatee . <p> From the beginning , everyone was willing to do what they could to help us and the manatee . <p> Gallery Furniture responded immediately to what would be very special transportation needs . <p> The U.S. Coast Guard 's port captain 's office did yeoman 's service in closing Buffalo Bayou with one day 's notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manatee 's appetite exceeded our immediate supply . <p> The " " men in blue " at the Houston Police Department managed the manatee fans and looked after our safety with its dive team . <p> The media folks were ever friendly and cooperative - even though my comments were often much less than quotable . <p> The city 's Public Works Department was a great host and was quick - even eager - to try to meet our every request . <p> I ca n't say enough about my colleagues at the Texas Parks and Wildlife department who did a great job on the boat . They quickly provided all the additional bodies that were needed to ensure that our second round with the manatee resulted in a pin - and win . <p> Last of all , to the people of Houston who demonstrated their support . To all of you who came to visit and help - thank you . <p> It was great . <p> Ron Jones , wildlife biologist , U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service , Ecological Service Field Office , Houston <p> The effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and GOPAC is laughable . GOPAC , the political action committee he headed , and Gingrich are blamed or credited with the 1994 election slaughter of the Democratic Party . <p> I 'm convinced that the real cause of the landslide change in the Senate and the House of Representatives was right before our eyes . <p> It 's called C-Span . Coverage of Congress provided viewers nationwide a chance to watch government in action . <p> A better-informed voting public has resulted in the selection of conservative vs. liberal candidates . I predict that selective split-ticket voting will continue , and that party-line voting will go the way of the dinosaur . <p> E. Crook , Onalaska <p> Check out eyes of Newt <p> Sorry , but Maxine Mesinger is off base in her Dec. 5 column . <p> She wrote that House Speaker Newt Gingrich is not widely regarded as " " charming and handsome . " <p> An articulate and extraordinarily intelligent man has a special charm . Add to that a deep desire to make our country a better place for all Americans with a willingness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wow , do you have an attractive man . <p> The next time you see Newt , check out that twinkle in his eye . <p> Lois Van Wart , Houston <p> Criticisms are deserved <p> There are quite a few differences between President Clinton 's avoidance of military service and the Republicans that Morris Tarleton so roundly criticizes in his Dec. 1 letter . <p> Sen. Phil Gramm , R-Texas , did not employ powerful state politicians to assist in a dodge of his military duty . Pat Buchanan never promised to join the ROTC to avoid the draft , and then dodge the ROTC commitment . Dan Quayle never wrote letters thanking his patrons for supporting his efforts to dodge the draft while at the same time " " maintaining my political viability . " House Speaker Newt Gingrich never went to foreign soil to organize anti-American rallies . <p> Clinton did all these things , which is why he is so deservedly criticized . <p> Pete Smith , Houston <p> City contractor woes <p> The well-written Dec. 5 editorial , " " Not so fast - Open city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of " " managed competition . " <p> Giving $ 3 million to HNTB Corp. , a consulting firm , is only a part of the problem . <p> The concept of hiring contractors to perform operations which rightfully are the function of a government entity should be questioned . <p> In some cases , as with NASA , contractors are essential because NASA has neither the manpower nor the expertise to perform all the tasks involved in spaceflight . <p> In other cases , however , the logic for hiring contractors escapes me . <p> Enough evidence is now available from the media to point to a growing trend in government , at all levels , to hire contractors . <p> Can prisons or sheriffs departments or water departments be operated better by contractors than by officials ? <p> There are problems with all levels of government . The proper approach for solving these problems is to analyze the in-house operations and then to take action , even if it means changing a law or two . <p> Richard C. Smart , Friendswood <p> Ca n't police the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " " Just exactly what does he ( military person ) think is the mission of the regular Army ? . . . The person who enlists in the Army is fully aware that he or she may be sent to the Arabian Gulf , etc . " <p> When a person enlists in the U.S. armed forces that is exactly what it means - for the defense of the United States . <p> We 're not at war with Bosnia . Why do people think U.S. military personnel are supposed to police the whole world ? <p> Evelyn Dudley , Houston <p> Wrong about gun law <p> Regarding Russell A. Smith 's Dec. 10 letter , " " Gun misuse more likely " : Smith based his statement on the fact that state Rep. Kevin Bailey had been arrested for threatening someone with a pistol . <p> Smith states : " " As Bailey has proven , increased access to handguns makes their misuse more , rather than less , likely . " <p> If Smith would study the statistics of states such as Florida and virtually every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will see that crime has gone down in those states . <p> C. A.
