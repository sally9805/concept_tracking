The bagpipers stand ready , tartan banners snap in the breeze , and the clans are gathered at Stone Mountain . They have come to celebrate // Beneath trees kilted with fall color , above a circle of families in tents , comes a bagpiper to begin the day at Stone Mountain Memorial Park near Atlanta . He fills the bag with three deep breaths . At first the racket sounds like the creaks and groans of an old man rising from bed . Yet from noise flow notes as clear as this October morning , and the agony of air turns into a sweet anthem-hymn . Early risers pause to doff their glengarry and Balmoral caps to music that has followed their families from Scotland across the sea to the South . Then , as the anthemhymn dies away , the Stone Mountain Highland Games &; Scottish Festival opens for the day . Yet throughout the games , this one song hangs in the air , just as it dwells deep in the souls of these Scottish Southerners . For a year I followed bagpipes to gatherings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tulsa and Texas , whole families in tartan follow these festivals like pros on a golf tour for weekends of Scottish heritage and customs . At each place they raise their clan tents and tartan banners and gather their families around them . Now they 've arrived at Stone Mountain for the 23rd year of this festival . Here the South meets Scotland among clan tents and vendor booths arrayed under pines . The games are going on in a grassy clearing . Men in kilts , with chests like whisky barrels and legs like oaks , grunt and heave stones , weights , and hammers for distance . They loft sheaves of hay over high bars , and flip 17- to 20-foot log poles in the air for the caber tossthe glamour event of the games . At first , athletes in these " heavy events " of the games move the way bagpipes sound-awkward and out of step-as they prepare to toss an object the size of a small person . Then comes the explosion from the muscular powder keg of legs , hips , and back , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in a final , graceful moment of release . The competition grows keen , but the atmosphere seems like that of ys gathered for a neighborhood competition . Amateurs in one division and pros in another ( who earn uly a little money ) trade helpful nts . In the legends division men their forties and fifties prove they 're still as strong as middleaged oxen , and share their game experience as well . Too bad Carl Braun of Fredericksburg , Virginia , is n't here , but e 's hobbling with a broken leg . Carl has won the U.S. Championships and set the North American record in the hammer throwgreat accomplishments for someone who just wanted to keep in shape . " I was looking for something to compete in after track and field in college , " Carl recalls . " My high school coach Nick Nichols said , Why do n't you try Highland games ? ' And I said , What are Highland games ? ' And he said , We toss telephone poles and wear a skirt . ' " Carl has competed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own game . But at events in Scotland , usually only officials and athletes wear kilts . At ones I visited there , I saw no circle of clan tents , no vendors selling caps and claymores . Food booths offered more hamburgers than haggis . You can buy plenty of haggis and Scotch eggs here at the Stone Mountain festival . Vendors sell caps , kilts , ties , and other doodads designed in nearly any clan tartan . You can buy videos ( Braveheart is a cult favorite among clans ) , bagpipes , and books on Scottish history . You can taste Scotland , hear it , then walk among the circle of clan tents to find Highland families such as Armstrongs , Frasiers , MacDougalls , Johnstones , Macdonalds , Campbells , and Macphersons . I 've come to know J. T and Lucy McPherson of Johnson City , Tennessee , at various games , and they welcome me again with their usual greeting , " Come on in . Have something to eat . How about some Lynchburg Lemonade . You mean you have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent among tables laden with Macpherson literature , a pot of Brunswick stew and plates of cornbread , and wee glasses of the " water of life " Scotch whisky . Outside , some festivalgoers strolling by only gaze curiously at the quaint dress of these Southerner-Scots . Others look lost , and it seems they 're searching for something . At one tent they scan the sept list of family names associated with that clan , frown , then move on to another tent . One woman with a baby stops at the Macpherson tent , searches the sept list , and smiles suddenly : " Oh , my great-grandmother was an Archibald , " she says and signs the register to join as a Macpherson clan member . Lucy nods after her . ' I he people who stop here want to be a part of a family . They want to belong . And we gain something too . All this family , we would never have met otherwise . Each game is like a family reunion . Each event makes our family larger . " Photograph As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-enactors wear the clothing and carry the weaponry of 18th-century Scottish soldiers .

When it lands it should be pointing between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. // Charlie Rhodarmer , curator of the Scottish Tartans Museum and Heritage Center in Franklin , North Carolina , knows why the skirl of bagpipes makes Southern men bare knobby knees under kilt hemlines . " The kilt has become a holy relic , " he says . " It is the representation of who I am and who I came from . " Each year seems to add a deeper Scottish burr to the South , particularly in North Carolina . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for immigrant Scots two centuries ago . In the l9th century , North Carolina claims it had more Scots there than any place outside Scotland . The Grandfather Mountain Highland Games near Asheville , one of the nation 's largest and best known , has spawned many other games around the South . In Laurinburg , St. Andrews Presbyterian College fields its own pipe band , hosts an annual Scottish Heritage Symposium , and has recently opened its Scottish Heritage Center . In Valle Crucis , the North American Academy of Piping turns out new bagpipers and drummers . Down in Moultrie , Georgia , the Ellen Payne Odom Genealogy Library stands like a headquarters castle of at least 84 clans in America . It 's tied by computer to Scotland , hosts a Scottish Weekend in Moultrie each February , and publishes a bimonthly newspaper on all things Scottish and genealogical for 65,000 subscribers . And each year more gatherings begin . Some are set in small places such as Culloden , Georgia . I want to see Lucy and J.

" Lots of Macphersons around here , " Lucy says . " We 've signed up four today . " But the first notes of the anthemhymn sound nearby , and soon , several gather around Senior Airman Pipe Major John Davis of the Band of the Air Force Reserve from Warner Robins , Georgia . " I do n't know of any other tune that exhibits more emotion on the bagpipes , " he tells me later . " People always stop when they hear this song . " And so they do today for this hymn that was written by John Newton , a former slave trader , a wretch who somehow found grace . In America it has followed us for more than a century of Sundays across the South , and now , it seems to have found in the bagpipes its perfect pitch in the common meter of family and place .
