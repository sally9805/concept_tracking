<p> ' I ALWAYS said that if I had a child , I would never abandon him , even if I had to eat my nails to stay alive , " says 17-year-old Juana Rodriguez , whose own mother abandoned her when she was in the first grade . " I wanted to be the mother to my son that my mother never was to me . " <p> But Juana was able to be that mother for only two days . On the third day after her son Francisco was born , when she went to nurse him in the infant ward of the public hospital , his crib was empty . <p> Francisco is one of hundreds of Honduran children who have been stolen or obtained in other illegal ways in order to " sell " them for adoption to couples from the United States , according to a Honduran congresswoman , military authorities , and a 200-page study by the Honduran Women 's Studies Center . <p> The demand for adoptable children by couples from industrialized nations has soared at the same time that poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragic business involving greedy professionals , wealthy foreign couples willing to pay up to $ 30,000 for a child , and poor mothers who reluctantly give up their children hoping that adoptive parents can give them a better material life , according to Nora Miselem Rivera , one of the three authors of the study , " Adoption : The Trafficking of Minors in Honduras . " <p> US families have adopted an average of 8,000 foreign children a year for the past five years . Almost 450 Honduran children were taken out of the country by American couples during 1990-1991 , according to the US Embassy here . All of these were apparently legal adoptions with all their papers in order . In the case of stolen children , however , documents are falsified and false witnesses are used , according to Ms. Rivera . <p> " We can only enforce US law and adhere to Honduran government standards , " says US Embassy spokeswoman Elizabeth Adair when asked if the embassy investigates adoption cases . " If something looks falsified , we report it to the Honduran government immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or abandoned , and in some cases they have serious health problems ; their lives are literally saved when a foreign couple adopts them . It is difficult to estimate how many adopted children are stolen or given up by their mothers after false promises from a lawyer or an intermediary . Some 800 Honduran children disappear each year just from Tegucigalpa , the capital , for a number of reasons . Some are runaways . But more than 15 cases of stolen children are reported each month . <p> " When the first cases were presented , we thought that this was something that with a few staff we could resolve , but now we realize that this is something in big proportions , " says Lt. Col. Manuel de Jesus Luna , the head of the national intelligence agency . " We are worried that those involved are perfecting the process to the point where it will be considered a legal business and children are sold as if they were common goods . " <p> NEWSPAPER headlines here have blared reports of bebetrafik since 1985 , when the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engorde are private homes where children are kept until adoptive parents are found . Congresswoman Rosario Godoy estimates that there are 22 such houses in the capital alone . Ms. Godoy has been pressuring the government for several years to crack down on baby-trafficking , but the process has been slow because of the powerful people involved in the business . These include lawyers , doctors , nurses , and government officials , according to Godoy and others . <p> In March 1992 , the National Congress suspended adoptions until the accusations of baby-trafficking could be investigated . But " children are still being stolen , lawyers are still processing adoptions , and Honduran children are leaving from the airport , " Rivera says . <p> Godoy , who is in the minority in Congress because of her sex , political party , and issue-oriented outspokenness , has recently led raids on several fattening houses . The front pages of local newspapers have printed dramatic photographs of police officers holding infants and other children found in the houses . <p> The public , which sees baby-trafficking as one more offense by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return of stolen children and has attacked people accused of trafficking children as the suspects were on their way to court . After Godoy received death threats for bringing the issue to public notice , she received a call from a man who said , " If anyone touches you , the children of lawyers involved in child-trafficking will start to disappear . " <p> Children are illegally obtained in a number of ways . A kidnapper may snatch an infant from its mother 's arms in public , sometimes as an accomplice distracts her . Several newborns have been stolen from public hospitals . In some cases , a young woman " rents her womb , " selling the unborn child to a lawyer who promises delivery expenses . <p> In other cases , an intermediary persuades a poor mother to give up her children with promises of trips to the United States to visit them . Even without such promises , some mothers , desiring the best for their children , give them up with the hope that they will have a better life with foreign couples who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trafficking , however , many mothers regret handing over their children and go in search of them . Rather than locating them in government-regulated orphanages , they find them neglected in poor or working-class fattening houses , or they never find them at all . <p> " I thought it was logical to give up my children for adoption because I am poor , " says Bessy Dalis Donaire , 29 , who gave up one child and almost gave up three others before she decided to recover the first . " I imagined them in good conditions , as I was promised . I could n't give anything to my children , not even schooling , and I wanted something better for them . " <p> If the reports of baby-trafficking are true , Honduras is in violation of the International Rights of the Child Convention . The treaty commits signatories to ensure that children are not separated from their parents involuntarily and requires that adoption proceedings be done in the interests of the child . <p> Recognizing the problem on a regional level , Central Americans have proposed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among other things , allow for the transfer of an adopted baby from one country to its country of origin if the adoption is proved illegal . <p> THE question for American couples is , what can they do to be sure that the children they are adopting were given up by the parents voluntarily ? <p> Godoy says that American couples can judge the legitimacy of an adoption by the lawyer 's fee . If the lawyer handling the adoption charges more than $ 2,000 , the couple should beware , she says . <p> Rivera says that couples also can find out which lawyers are involved in baby-trafficking by consulting adoption agencies and the Human Rights Committee of Honduras . <p> " An adoptive couple must be prepared that the child they adopt may be emotionally traumatized and that some day they may realize that the child was stolen , " Rivera adds . <p> Rivera is not necessarily against foreigners adopting Honduran children , but she says : " By promoting adoptions by foreigners , the government is saving itself from its responsibility to protect those children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our country . " <p> Juana Rodriguez 's son was stolen May 9 , 1992 . Affectionately holding the child whom she babysits in exchange for room and board , she says , " Francisco was born a week earlier and weighed more , so he should be just a little bit bigger by now . Also , he was light-skinned and had lots of straight black hair . " <p> " When I found out that Francisco was gone , my head started pounding , my knees went weak , and I laughed and cried from nervousness , " she recalls . " Then when I went to complain to the director of the hospital , he tried to calm me down by saying , ' Do n't worry , you 're young . You can have another . ' "
