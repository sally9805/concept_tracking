<p> So , you ca n't kick the baseball habit and preseason football or postseason roller hockey offers no redeeming value . To help satisfy the cravings of the hardball junkies , we 're offering a few suggestions to make the strike less painful . <p> These alternatives may not be as simple as flipping on SportsChannel and watching reruns of Matt and Barry , but tough times call for sacrifices and a little imagination . <p> HIT THE ROAD <p> If you want to catch live pro baseball , the California League , with 10 teams in the state and three in NorCal ( San Jose Giants , Modesto A 's and Stockton Ports ) , is the obvious choice . The A 's Modesto team is in first place . The San Jose Giants are fighting for a playoff spot , and Stockton , a Milwaukee Brewers affiliate , is in last place . <p> But do n't for one minute think of the California League as the only alternative . A day 's drive will take you north of the border and into such beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baseball nuts , who also do n't mind sitting behind a steering wheel , have been known to hit all three Northwest League ballparks in one weekend and make it back to work by Monday morning . <p> Medford is the home of the Southern Oregon A 's . Playing in right field for the A 's is the No. 2 pick overall in the June amateur draft , Ben Grieve . Grieve is hitting in the .320s and leading the team with seven homers and 40 RBIs . The Rockies and the Royals have the farm teams in Bend and Eugene , respectively . <p> And if you can get a few days off around the Labor Day weekend , a road trip extravaganza  --  five days , five games , four leagues  --  is not out of the question , but we recommend not to try this alone . The 2,400-mile trip could go something like this : <p> * Thursday , September 1 : San Bernardino at Stockton , 7:05 p.m . Avoid Bay Bridge traffic getting out of town and this Cal League game is a snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 56 saves for Cardinals and Royals , 1973-82 ) and San Bernardino outfielder and former big-leaguer Cecil Espy ( Rangers outfielder , late ' 80s ) . <p> * Friday , September 2 : After 13 hours on Interstate 80 ( not including a six-hour stopover in Winnemucca , Nev. , for a catnap ) , you 're in Utah for a Pioneer League game : Idaho Falls at Ogden . Game time : 7 p.m . Serge Simmons Stadium is next to Fort Buenaventura State Park . <p> * Saturday , September 3 : Only 5 1/2 hours northwest on Interstate 84 , takes you to Boise , Idaho , for Bend vs . Boise , a Class A Northwest League game . Game time : 7 p.m . David Sick , a former San Jose State standout , is with Boise , an Angels affiliate . <p> * Sunday , September 4 : Six hours later  --  not counting brunch in Baker , Ore .  --  and it 's the Apple Country of Yakima , Wash . The Yakima Bears ( a Dodgers farm club ) take on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former S.F. Giants pitcher and Everett coach Keith Comstock . Game time : 7:05 p.m . <p> * Monday , September 5 : If you leave the Everett-Yakima game a little early , you can do the three hours of Interstate 82 and 90 and reach Seattle in time for a ginger ale ( Ivar 's on the wharf ) and a good night 's sleep . The Pacific Coast League regular-season finale  --  Albuquerque Dukes ( another Dodgers ' affiliate ) at Tacoma A 's  --  could be for a playoff berth . Game time : 1:35 p.m . <p> It 's 14 1/2 hours of Interstate 5 and 80 between Tacoma and San Francisco . If you leave Tacoma at 4:30 p.m. , you can make it home by 7 a.m. , sleep for an hour , and be to work by 8:30 a.m . Good luck and send us a postcard . <p> For less taxing alternatives , consider : <p> . <p> BOOKS <p> There are at least 100 new titles every year dealing with the major leagues alone and enough classics to fill an entire floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's history , the current state of the game or fiction you 're into , just scour the shelves at a good bookstore and you 're likely to find something . <p> Recommendations include " Lords of the Realm " by John Helyar to fully understand the origin of today 's labor strife . To relive the heartbreak of the Indians over the last 30 years , try Terry Pluto 's " The Curse of Rocky Colavito . " Another sure bet is " October 1964 , " accomplished author David Halberstam 's in-depth look at the beginning of the end of the Yankees ' dynasty . <p> . <p> MOVIES AND PLAYS <p> Since April , there have been a bevy of new titles to hit the big screen . Among them , " Angels in the Outfield " and " Little Big League " are probably still out there somewhere . If not , spend three bucks and rent from a huge list of titles with baseball themes . You ca n't go wrong with " Eight Men Out , " " Field of Dreams , " or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball themes , " Let 's Play Two , " a romantic comedy at the Cable Car Theater on Mason Street , has received favorable reviews . A longtime hit , " Bleacher Bums , " is opening tomorrow at the Multi Ethnic Theatre on DeHaro Street . <p> . <p> COLLECTIBLES <p> If you want to see ballplayers , and do n't want to loiter at golf courses hoping to catch a glimpse of them , then pick up a copy of one of the baseball card/collectible trade magazines  --  " Sports Collectors Digest " is one  --  and find out which big leaguer will be signing autographs in your area . <p> Hall of Famers Johnny Bench , Bob Gibson , Catfish Hunter and others will be appearing at the annual Labor Day show at the Fashion Center in San Francisco from Sept. 2-5 . Caution : The autographs will cost you anywhere from $ 5 to $ 25 and a three-hour wait in line to get the autograph in not uncommon . <p> . <p> PCL EXHIBIT <p> The Oakland Museum 's " Runs , Hits &; an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pacific Coast League , is a must . Admission is voluntary , parking is relatively easy and it may be the last chance to experience a slice of minor-league history like this . The exhibit , originally scheduled to close in July , has been extended until October 30 . <p> . <p> PERIODICALS <p> If you want to know who 's leading the Toledo Mud Hens in home runs or what former Giants second baseman Wallace Johnson is up to , Baseball America magazine and USA Today 's Baseball Weekly are there to assist . Both provide excellent sources of minor-league news and statistics as well as commentary on what may or may not be happening with the strike . <p> . <p> CABLE TELEVISION <p> As the strike wears on , baseball programming on the cable networks will be getting slimmer and slimmer , so get it while you can . ESPN 's Baseball Tonight is scheduled to air its final show on Sunday , unless it sees a need to continue . ESPN will not air Sunday 's minor-league game with the Birmingham Barons as the ratings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , ESPN will air the 1994 All-Star Game 's home-run hitting contest . <p> WTBS , the Atlanta Braves superstation offered by most cable companies , will broadcast two Class AAA Richmond games in the next week , Friday night at Toledo and next Wednesday at home against Pawtucket . It is n't much , but it 's baseball . There wo n't be any minor-league games from WGN , the Cubs ' station . A WGN spokesperson said the next live sports programming , barring a strike settlement , will be the Bulls in October . <p> FANTASY LEAGUES <p> This is probably too weird for most , but do-it-yourself groups can get together , choose 15 players off minor-league rosters and go from there . With less than three weeks left in most minor-league seasons , time is running out . <p> . <p> VIDEO GAMES <p> Most video rental outfits offer video games as well . Certain Blockbuster stores have about a dozen Sega Genesis/Super Nintendo titles to choose from , including " Ken Griffey Jr. , " " World Series Baseball " and " Dusty Baker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PLAY <p> There are pay-for-play batting cages all over the Bay Area ; check the yellow pages for the closest one near you .
