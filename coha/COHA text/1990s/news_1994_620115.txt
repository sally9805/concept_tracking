<p> LEGEND HAS IT THAT OUR ORIGINAL FOREBEAR got into deep trouble for eating  --  au naturel  --  a quarantined apple . Maybe if he had turned the forbidden fruit into coq aux pommes or a nice littler lobster salad , Adam would n't have been banned forever from that terribly in place with the divine food . <p> Apples , for one reason or another , have taken a special place in human lore  --  think Paris and the Apple of Discord , William Tell , Johnny Appleseed , an apple for teacher , an apple a day . No other fruit has achieved such prominence . When did you last hear someone called " the kiwi of my eye " ? <p> Lately , Bay Area chefs have been polishing the image of the apple even more by letting it expand its presence well beyond the dessert card . Apples are being assigned starring or strong supporting roles in salads , entrees and savory side dishes . <p> There is precedent for such uses in European cuisines , especially in such major apple-growing regions as Normandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roast pork with apple sauce . <p> In its new , more sophisticated guise , that combination appears as apple-onion marmalade with pork confit on chef Gerald Hirigoyen 's bill of fare at Fringale . Another apple dish he offers is smoked duck salad with julienned Granny Smith apples in a hazelnut dressing . Hirigoyen , a native of the Basque region of France , believes apples " add a little sparkle " to these preparations . The sweetness they impart in a dish , he says , is much preferable to the use of sugar . Of course , he notes , these are all autumn dishes . <p> The theme of seasonality is embraced by other chefs . Apples may be available year-round , but chefs like to use them only when the local harvest comes in . <p> Loretta Keller , chef at Bizou , is not generally a devotee of fruit in savory dishes  --  except in the fall . A favorite on her menu these weeks is sauteed rabbit with savoy cabbage , pancetta and apples sauteed and then briefly braised in the pan with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keller says the apples contribute an appealing freshness and a sweet/tart complexity . " It reminds me of a garden , " she says with a laugh . " Rabbits , cabbage , apples  --  it all fits together . " <p> Alain Rondelli , whose namesake restaurant is a small French bastion on Clement Street , gets philosophical in advocating the use of foodstuffs in their time . " I believe in a higher power , " he says , " and there must be a reason for the seasons . " <p> He admits that California can be confusing with its constant supply of produce not only from different regions but also from different hemispheres . He advises consumers to look at prices : If the price is high , you are probably looking at an import , harvested long ago , stored and shipped ; if it 's reasonable , chances are it 's a plentiful local crop . <p> Rondelli recently gave a demonstration of savory apple cooking at the Ferry Plaza farmers ' market . The piece de resistance was a starter he serves at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The consomme 's accents of lemon grass , cinnamon , star anise and mint , he says , wake up the palate . But he also presents apples to advantage in a simple appetizer in which the slightly caramelized fruit contrasts with a wedge of Roquefort , the fruit 's sweet tartness heightened with a classic French gastrique , a reduction of sugar and vinegar . <p> Rondelli thinks the increasing popularity of apples in dishes other than desserts ties in with today 's tendency toward more healthful cooking . It was easy , he says , to get rich texture and a marrying of flavors the old-fashioned way , with reductions of cream and butter . Pureed fruits and vegetables , he explains , can give similar results with far less artery-clogging . <p> Wendy Brucker , chef-owner of Berkeley 's Rivoli , proves Rondelli 's point in a wine-braised chicken with apples . It might be called coq aux pommes , strongly resembling coq au vin , though far lighter and fresher than that classic : It has no bacon , no roux for thickening the sauce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it , though , tasting this satisfying dish . <p> Taking the healthful possibilities in apples to the extreme , Eric Tucker , chef at San Francisco 's brand-new vegan restaurant , Millennium has a bushel basket of fall dishes made with fruit . Among them : Moroccan-inspired phyllo roulade filled with mushrooms , spinach and apples ; braised red cabbage with apples , serrano chile and fennel seeds ; sherry-braised squash and apples turned into a rich soup finished with cashew cream and accented with fresh fennel . In Tucker 's opinion , apple and fennel are a match made in culinary heaven . <p> Other chefs like the dual sweet- tart personality of apples as a counterpoint to rich foods . Gary Danko , executive chef of the Dining Room in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel , considers apples paired with onion the perfect foil for foie gras , searing the apple slices in foie gras fat . <p> He works absolute apple magic with some of the best-flavored crab cakes around and likes to garnish them with a relish using essentially the same ingredients that go into the crab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  of course  --  apples . <p> Danko 's favorite apple is the Fuji because , he says , it keeps its shape when cooked . His counterpart at Campton Place , Todd Humphries , swears by black Jonathans , which he picks up at the Ferry Plaza farmers ' market . Humphries ' shopping trips highlight another interesting trend : A lot of today 's major-league chefs do n't just sit at their desks , ordering from big suppliers . Like good home cooks of old , they go to market and pick the best for their kitchens . <p> Humphries , like Bizou 's Keller , does a full-flavored rabbit with apples , completing the dish with robust sauerkraut . The recipe is a bit daunting for a home cook , but Humphries has one important tip to heed in other preparations : include the peelings when making sauce ( strain them out later ) to get the full benefit of the fruit flavor . <p> Taking the apple theme to its greatest heights , Charles Solomon of The Heights restaurant on Sacramento Street recently did a dinner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piquant horseradish-dressed lobster salad circled by sauteed endive leaves and apples , then went on to salmon , petrale sole , foie gras and squab  --  each paired with an appropriate apple . <p> Then there is Eric Gallanter of Eric restaurant , who smokes apple slices and layers them with turkey , Brie and arugula leaves between toasted slices of levain bread spread with honey mustard .
