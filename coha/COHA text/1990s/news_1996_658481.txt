<p> Foliage . Football . Falling apples . These are a few of autumn 's most celebrated events in New England . Those planning a trip to attend a game or see the spectacular kaleidoscope of fall foliage might also consider the bounty available at the region 's ivied college museums . Harvard , Yale , Dartmouth , Williams , Bowdoin - all of these schools had libraries and most of them also established museums , which began , in many cases , as repositories for strange items that alumni and other benefactors donated . Today , college art museums offer special delights . For starters , you do n't encounter the crowds . Being jostled and shoved when you 're trying to get a good look at a Rembrandt sketch or a Giacometti bronze can be quite disconcerting . Second , because there are typically fewer works on display , you can spend more time seeing what 's there . Another plus for college museums derives from their educational character . This often results in smaller , more tightly focused exhibitions . And while some museums have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning something and furthering the cause of higher education in the process . The choices are many , but this tour features five of the best college art museums in New England as well as a couple of Bay State gems found along the way . Yale University New Haven , Conn . Yale , the nation 's third-oldest academic institution , claims to have the oldest university art museum in the Western Hemisphere , dating from 1832 , when the American artist John Trumbull donated more than 100 of his paintings to Yale College . Its vast resources , numbering well over 100,000 objects today , are mostly housed in two buildings on the tree-lined New Haven campus : a Gothic structure built in 1928 , and , connected to it , Louis I. Kahn 's first major commission , built in 1953 . Yale 's art collection is more comprehensive than most university collections , with notable strengths in paintings and drawings from the Italian Renaissance , Greek and Etruscan statuary , pre-Columbian art , and American painting and decorative arts . A major exhibit opening there today is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received rave reviews this past summer during its exhibit at the National Gallery in Washington . ( It remains at Yale through Jan. 14 , 1997 . ) With a handful of images - nine oils and 14 works on paper representing everything from sketches to finished oil paintings and exquisite watercolors - the show epitomizes what a focused , scholarly exhibit ought to be : comprehensive , enjoyable , understandable , and above all , illuminating . Taking viewers deep into the heart and mind of the redoubtable Eakins ( 1844-1916 ) , who went on to become a master of the psychological portrait , the show offers insights into the way an artist thinks and what Eakins was trying to accomplish . Rhode Island School of Design ( RISD ) Providence , R.I. Roughly 100 miles up Interstate 95 from New Haven lies Rhode Island School of Design ( RISD ) , which , since 1877 , has been educating designers and artists - at first primarily for the state 's textile mills and other local industries . Located in Providence , which has done a fine job of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Art is extensive ( more than 100,000 objects ) and varied . Eleven departmental and college galleries have collections ranging from classical sculpture to Old Master , French , English , and Japanese prints to contemporary crafts and decorative arts . Given its focus on design and art , RISD 's exhibits have a strong practical function . There is also an unusually rich blend of painting and sculpture with more varied disciplines , such as textiles , ceramics , woodblock prints , and graphic , industrial , and decorative arts . As a result , the RISD museum experience forces one to think more broadly about the roles of art and design in our lives . Two fall exhibitions , " Malcolm Grear : The Art of Design " ( through Dec. 1 ) , and " Dress , Art , &; Society " ( through Jan. 5 ) make this clear . The former is a retrospective of the design achievements of Grear , for many years a teacher at RISD , as well as the head of an internationally known design firm chosen as the major designer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grear 's work over 35 years on everything from textbooks , museum catalogs , and posters , to graphic design packages for hospitals , colleges , and corporations . The latter exhibit explores how fashion from the late 18th century through the 19th reflects cultural developments . What RISD provides in a compact , tightly woven diversity is more scattered on three separate venues along the eastern edge of Harvard Yard . Harvard University Cambridge , Mass . Like the big corporation that it is , Harvard does n't have an art museum - it has three of them . The Fogg Art Museum , the Arthur M. Sackler Museum , and the Busch-Reisinger Museum are very different , but fortunately for the untutored tourist , they 're clustered quite literally within a stone 's throw of one another . The Fogg , housed in an Italian Renaissance structure , looks older than it is . ( It opened to the public in 1895 . ) It is stodgy , with clear demarcations of dates and periods so that one can trace the development of Western art from the Middle Ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted Wert-heim Collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art is buttressed by many collections of photographs , prints , and drawings . Adjoining the Fogg is the Busch-Reisinger Museum , with a grand array of German Expressionism , Vienna Secession art , 1920s abstract art , and the work of German sculptor Joseph Beuys . The interior has a much more modern , airy feel than the Fogg , and the details of everything from the rectangular floor tiles to the Marcel Breuer chairs reflect the strengths of modern German design . Founded in 1902 with the intent of housing reproductions , the Busch-Reisinger has since 1930 actively acquired original works of art , many deemed " degenerate " by the Nazis . The Arthur M. Sackler Museum , the newest of the Harvard art museums , houses the university 's collection of Asian , Islamic , and Indian art as well as the offices of the Department of Fine Arts and the Rubel Library , a major research center for Asian art . The fall lineup at Harvard includes : " The Mediated Object " ( contemporary works from the Eli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " Masterworks of Ukiyo-e " ( aspects of 18th-century Japanese culture featuring woodblock prints of two Ukiyo masters ; through Jan. 12 at the Sackler ) ; " Masterworks of East Asian Painting " ( works on paper and silk along with ceramics and jades from China , Korea , and Japan ; through Jan. 12 at the Sackler ) ; " Anna and Bernhard Blume Photo-Works " ( two German collaborative artists ' first major show ; through Nov. 24 at the Busch-Reisinger and the Fogg ) ; " David Rabinowitch : Sculptures and Templates , 1968 " ( through Jan. 12 at the Fogg ) ; and " Tiepolo and His Circle " ( drawings from American collections by the great Italian 18th- century artist ; Oct. 12-Dec.15 at the Sackler ) . Several more shows , including explorations of the Renaissance , African art , and what makes prints valuable , are slated for openings in November and December . Dartmouth College Hanover , N.H. Reasons are many for visiting Hanover , N.H. , just across the Connecticut River from Vermont : the spectacular scenery en route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with restaurants and shops ; the bucolic campus of Dartmouth College flowing out from its classic green ; Baker Library , where in the 1930s , the second most-famous Mexican muralist , Jose Clemente Orozco , painted a huge fresco along the basement walls . And for the last 15 years , there 's been the Hood Museum . Designed by architects Charles Moore and Chad Floyd , the Hood shows traces throughout of Moore 's whimsy , in the backlighting , in the ornaments that seem to pop up so unexpectedly , in the long stairway that looks more like it belongs on a heavy cruiser than in such refined space , in galleries that seem to appear out of nowhere . And here , as at the Fogg , RISD , and Yale , there are important set pieces college museums all seem to have - Assyrian reliefs , a vase from Attica , silverware from Philadelphia , an African mask . The Hood 's fall offerings include : " Crowning Achievements : African Arts of Dressing the Head " ( traditional and contemporary hats , headdresses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Correspondences : African Sculpture " ( with figural sculptures from the Hood 's permanent collection as well as 20 pieces on loan from the Franklin Family collection ; Oct. 12-March 2 ) . Williams College Williamstown , Mass . The journey down the Vermont/New Hampshire border from Hanover to Williamstown , Mass. , is breathtaking . And the plum at the end of the trip , the quintessential New England village of Williamstown , has many delights , not least of all Williams College ( founded in 1788 ) , with its own Charles Moore-designed museum , and the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute , which , though not directly tied to the college , is a must-see . In addition to its top-notch exhibitions and its renowned collection of the works of Maurice and Charles Prendergast , the Williams College Museum of Art ( WCMA ) recently inaugurated a program called " Labeltalk , " in which interesting and important works of art are n't identified by a single label , but by three or four labels , with brief , thoughtful commentary by faculty members in different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central to what the great American poet Wallace Stevens articulated in a poem called " Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird " : namely , that works of art lend themselves to multiple interpretations . This season , WCMA features " Labeltalk 1996 " ( through Dec. 1 ) ; " Dreams and Realities : Charles Prendergast and the 1940s " ( through June 1997 ) ; and " Robert Frank : The Americans " ( major retrospective of photographs published as a book in 1959 that became one of the most influential series of postwar-era photos , Oct. 12-Dec. 1 ) . Nearby is the Clark Art Institute , a wonderful museum with recently renovated galleries and a superb , if eclectic , collection . The white marble building that opened in 1955 , with the scale of the smaller galleries , is complemented by a red-granite addition designed in 1973 by architect Pietro Belluschi and The Architects Collaborative . Robert Sterling Clark , a Yale alum whose father and grandfather were trustees at Williams , led a life that included military service in the Boxer Rebellion , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris as an art collector , where he courted Francine Cray , who became his wife in 1919 . The couple amassed a fine collection of art by old masters and then-contemporary artists - Sargent , Homer , Degas , Renoir . The Clark is celebrating its 40th anniversary with a real crowd pleaser , " A Passion for Renoir , " which runs through Jan. 5 . It includes 33 paintings by Pierre-Auguste Renoir . Phillips Academy at Andover Andover , Mass . The trip back on down Route 2 along the Mohawk Trail and up to Andover is yet another lovely drive . The Phillips Academy at Andover , alma mater of many notable figures , is one of the country 's premier prep schools . The Addison Gallery of American Art 's collection is modest , but what it lacks in numbers , it more than makes up for in quality . It belongs in a class by itself . The history of the Addison is recounted in an exhibit catalog published last spring for the gallery 's 65th anniversary . Fall offerings at the Addison include " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and oils of a section of Andover that Sheeler discovered while artist-in-residence at the academy ; through Dec. 1 ) and " Dorothea Lange , Wendy Ewald , and Judith Joy Ross " ( exhibit of three major American photographers ; through Jan. 5 ) .
