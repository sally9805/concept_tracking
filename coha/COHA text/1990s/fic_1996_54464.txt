It seems as if the 1992 elections just ended , and yet this magazine arrives in your mailbox at the beginning of primary season . So , with politics on our minds , we searched for some appropriate stories . <p> Political science fiction is often about the ramifications of social change . Rarely does the political sf story ( these days ) begin with a point of technological change . In " First Tuesday , " Robert Reed uses a change in technology to examine the future of **25;1003;TOOLONG relations . <p> AFTER A LOT OF PESTERING , More told Stefan , " Fine , you can pick the view . " Only it was n't an easy job , and Stefan enjoyed it even more than he 'd hoped . Standing on the foam-rock patio , he spoke to the house computer , asking for the Grand Canyon , then Hawaii 's coast , then Denali . He saw each from many vantage points , never satisfied and never sure why not . Then he tried Mount Rushmore , which was better . Except Yancy saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out long enough to say , " Change it . Now . " No debate ; no place for compromise . Stefan settled on the Grand Canyon , on a popular view from the North Rim , telling himself that ' it was lovely and appropriate , and he hoped their guest would approve , and how soon would he be here . . . ? In another couple seconds , Stefan realized . Jesus , now . . . ! <p> A figure appeared on the little lawn . He was tall , wearing a fancy suit , that famous face smiling straight at Stefan . And the boy jumped into the house , shouting with glee : <p> " The President 's here ! " <p> His stepfather muttered something . <p> Mom whined , " Oh , but I 'm not ready . " <p> Stefan was ready . He ran across the patio , leaping where it ended . His habit was to roll down the worn grassy slope . But he was wearing good clothes , and this evening was full of civic responsibilities . Landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to look like the most perfect citizen possible . <p> The President appeared solid . Not real , but nearly so . <p> The face was a mixture of Latin and African genes . The dreadlocks were long enough to kiss his broad shoulders . Halfway through his second term , President Perez was the only president that Stefan could remember , and even though this was just a projection , an interactive holo generated by machines . . . it was still an honor to have him here , and Stefan felt special , and for more reasons than he could count , he was nervous . In good ways , and in bad ways too . <p> " Hello ? " chirped the eleven-year-old boy . " Mr. President ? " <p> The projection had n't moved . The house computer was wrestling with its instructions , fashioning a personality within its finite capacity . There was a sound , a sudden " Sssss " generated by speakers hidden in the squidskin fence and sky . The projection opened its mouth ; a friendly , reedy voice managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering both hands while saying , " Hello , young man . I 'm so very glad to meet you . " <p> Of course he knew Stefan 's name . The personality could read the boy 's public files . Yet the simple trick impressed him , and in response he shouted , " I 'm glad to meet you , Mr. President . " <p> The brown hands had no substance , yet they could n't have acted more real . Gripping Stefan 's pale little hand , they matched every motion , the warmth carried by the bright eyes and his words . " This is an historic moment , Stefan . But then you already know that , I 'm sure . " <p> The first nationwide press conference , yes . Democracy and science joined in a perfect marriage . President Perez was invited here for a symbolic dinner , and he was everywhere else at the same time . It was a wondrous evening . . . magical . . . ! <p> " A lovely yard , " said the President . The eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security cameras , building appropriate images as the face moved . With a faraway gaze , he announced , " I do like your choice of view . " <p> " Thank you , Mr. President . " <p> " Very nice indeed . . . ! " <p> Holo projectors and squidskin fabrics created the illusion of blue skies and rugged geology . Although nothing was quite as bright as it would appear in the real outdoors , of course . And the squidskin rocks and the occasional bird had a vagueness , a dreamy imprecision , that was the mark of a less-than-good system . Sometimes , like now , the antinoise generators failed to hide unwanted sounds . Somewhere beyond the President , neighbors were applauding and cheering making it seem as if ghosts inhabited the ghostly canyon . <p> President Perez seemed oblivious to the imperfections . Gesturing at their garden , he said , " Oh , I see you 're doing your part . How close are you to self-sufficiency ? " <p> Not close at all , really . <p> " Beautiful eggplants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And a fish pond too ! " <p> Without fish . A problem with the filter , but the boy said nothing , hoping nothing would be noticed . <p> The President was turning in a circle , hunting for something else to compliment . For some reason , the house was n't wearing its usual coat of projected paints and architectural flourishes . Their guest was too complicated , no doubt . Too many calculations , plus the computer had to show the Grand Canyon . . . and the real house lay exposed in all its drabness . Glass foams and cardboard looked gray and simple , and insubstantial , three walls inside the yard and the fourth wall pointed toward the outdoors , the brown stains on the sky showing where rainwater had damaged the squidskin . <p> To break the silence , Stefan blurted out a question . " Mr. President , where do you stand on the economy ? " <p> That 's how reporters asked questions . <p> But the great man did n't respond in the expected way . His smile changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different flavor of light . " I 'll stand on the economy 's head , " he replied . " With my feet apart , ready for anything . " <p> Was that a genuine answer ? <p> Stefan was n't sure . <p> Then the President knelt , putting his head below the boy 's , saying with a happy , self-assured voice , " Thank you for the question . And remember , what happens tonight goes both ways . You can learn what I 'm thinking , and in a different way I 'll learn what 's on your mind . " <p> Stefan nodded , well aware of the principles . <p> " When I wake , " said the handsome brown face , " I 'll read that this many people asked about the economy , and how they asked it , and what they think we should be doing . All that in an abbreviated form , of course . A person in my position needs a lot of abbreviations , I 'm afraid . " <p> " Yes , sir . " Stefan waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're doing a good job with the economy , sir . I really do . " <p> " Well , " said the guest , " I 'm very , very glad to hear it . I am . " <p> At that moment , the genuine President Perez was inside a government hospital , in a fetal position , suspended within a gelatin bath . Masses of bright new optical cable were attached to his brain and fingers , mouth and anus , linking him directly with the Net . Everything that he knew and believed was being blended with his physical self , all elements reduced to a series of numbers , then enlarged into a nationwide presence . Every household with an adequate projection system and memory was being visited , as were public buildings and parks , stadiums and VA facilities . If it was a success , press conferences would become a monthly event . Political opponents were upset , complaining that this was like one enormous commercial for Perez ; but this was the President 's last term , and it was an experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper and more widespread every day . <p> In the future , perhaps by the next election , each political party would be able to send its candidates to the voters ' homes . <p> What could be more fair ? thought the boy . <p> Stefan 's stepfather had just stepped from the drab house , carrying a plate full of raw pink burgers . <p> In an instant , the air seemed close and thick . <p> " Mr. Thatcher , " said the projection , " thank you for inviting me . I hope you 're having a pleasant evening . . . ! " <p> " Hey , I hope you like meat , " Yancy called out . " In this family , we 're carnivores ! " <p> Stefan felt a sudden and precise terror . <p> But the President did n't hesitate , gesturing at the buffalo-augmented soy patties . Saying , " I hope you saved one for me . " <p> " Sure , Mr. President . Sure . " <p> For as long as Stefan could remember , his stepfather had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perez . But Morn had made him promise to be on his best behavior . Not once , but on several occasions . " I do n't want to be embarrassed , " she had told him , using the same tone she 'd use when trying to make Stefan behave . " I want him to enjoy himself , at least this once . Will you please just help me ? " <p> Yancy Thatcher was even paler than his stepson . Blonde hair worn in a short , manly ponytail ; a round face wearing a perpetually sour expression . He was n't large , but he acted large . He spoke with a deep , booming voice , and he carried himself as if endowed with a dangerous strength . Like now . Coming down the slope , he was walking straight toward their guest . The President was offering both hands , in his trademark fashion . But no hand was offered to him , and the projection retreated , saying , " Excuse me , " while deftly stepping out of the way . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low , unamused fashion . Never breaking stride . <p> Mom was n't watching ; that 's why he was acting this way . <p> Things worsened when Yancy looked over his shoulder , announcing , " I did n't want you coming tonight , frankly . But the kid 's supposed to do an assignment for school , and besides , I figured this was my chance to show you my mind . If you know what I mean . . . . " <p> President Perez nodded , dreadlocks bouncing . " Feedback is the idea . As I was just telling Stefan  --  " <p> " I 'm an old-fashioned white man , Mr. President . " <p> The boy looked at the drab house , willing Morn to appear . <p> But she did n't , and Yancy flung open the grill and let the biogas run too long before he made a spark , a soft blue explosion causing Stefan to back away . Nobody spoke . Every eye , seeing or blind , watched the patties hit the warming rack , sizzling quietly but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spatula that he 'd gotten for Christmas last year . <p> Then the President spoke , ignoring that last comment . <p> " It 's a shame this technology wo n't let me help you , " he declared , with a ring of honesty . <p> Yancy grimaced . <p> The patties grew louder , the flames turning yellow . <p> Obstinately ignoring the tensions , the President looked at his own hands . " A poverty of physicality , " he declared , laughing to himself . <p> That was it . Something snapped , and Yancy barked , " Know what I like , Mr. President ? About tonight , I mean . " <p> " What do you like ? " <p> " Thinking that the real you is buried in goo , a big fat glass rope stuck up your ass . " <p> Stefan prayed for a systems failure , or better , a war . Anything that would stop events here . His fear of fears was that the President would awaken to learn that Yancy Thatcher of Fort Wayne , Indiana had insulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country having the stupid courage to say such an awful thing . <p> Yet their guest was n't visibly angry . He actually laughed , quietly and calmly . And all he said was , " Thank you for your honesty , sir . " <p> Yancy flipped burgers , then looked at Stefan . " Tell your more it 'll be a few minutes . And take him with you . " <p> It was such a strange , wondrous moment . <p> The boy looked at his President , at his smile , hearing the conjured voice saying " Yes . That 's a fine idea . " Built of light and thought , he seemed invulnerable to every slight , every unkind word . <p> Stefan had never envied anyone so much in his life . <p> Mom was a blizzard of activity , hands blurring as they tried to assemble a fancy salad from ingredients grown in the garden , then cleaned and cut into delicate , artful shapes . She loved salads , planning each with an artist 's sensibilities , which to Morn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to be done too fast at the end . When she saw Stefan inside , she whined , " I 'm still not ready . " When she saw President Perez fluttering for that instant when he passed from the outside to the kitchen projectors , she gave a little squeal and threw spinach in every direction . Then she spoke , not leaving enough time to think of proper words . " You 've lost weight , " she blurted . " Since the election , have n't you . . . . ? " <p> Embarrassed again , Stefan said , " The President of the United States , " with a stem voice . In warning . Did n't Morn remember how to address him ? <p> But the President seemed amused , if anything . " I 've lost a couple kilos , yes . Job pressures . And the First Lady 's anti-equatorial campaign , too . " <p> The joke puzzled Stefan until he stopped thinking about it . <p> " A drink , Mr. President ? I 'm having a drop for myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If that 's not too much trouble . " <p> Both adults giggled . Touching a control , More ordered an elegant glass to appear on the countertop , already filled with sparkling white wine , and their guest went through the motions of sipping it , his personality given every flavor along with an ethanol kick . " Lovely , " he declared . " Thanks . " <p> " And how is the First Lady ? " <p> It was a trivial question , Stefan within his rights to groan . <p> Mom glared at him , in warning . " Go find Candace , why do n't you ? " Then she turned back to their guest , again inquiring about his dear wife . <p> " Quite well , thank you . But tired of Washington . " <p> Mom 's drink was large and colorful , projected swirls of red and green never mixing together . " I wish she could have come . I adore her . And oh , I love what she 's done with your house . " <p> The President glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd approve of your tastes , Mrs. Thatcher . " <p> " Helen . " <p> " Helen , then . " <p> The kitchen walls and ceiling were covered with an indoor squidskin , and they built the illusion of a tall room . . . except that voices and any sharp sound echoed off the genuine ceiling , flat and close , unadorned by the arching oak beams that only appeared to be high overhead . <p> Mom absorbed the compliment and the sound of her own name , then noticed Stefan still standing nearby . " Where 's Candace ? Will you please go find your sister , darling ? " <p> Candace 's room was in the basement . It seemed like a long run to a boy who would rather be elsewhere , and worse , her door was locked . Stefan shook the knob , feeling the throb of music that seeped past the noise barriers . " He 's here ! Come on ! " Kicking the door down low , he managed to punch a new hole that joined half a dozen earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him  --  ? " <p> " Open , " his sister shouted . <p> The knob turned itself . Candace was standing before a mirrored portion of squidskin , examining her reflection . Every other surface showed a fantastic woodland , lush red trees interspersed with a thousand Candaces who danced with unicorns , played saxophones , and rode bareback on leaping black tigers . The images were designed to jar nerves and exhaust eyes . But what Stefan noticed was the way his sister was dressed , her outfit too small and tight , her boobs twice their normal size . She was ready for a date , and he warned her , " They wo n't let you go . It 's only Tuesday . " <p> Candace gave her little brother a cutting worldly look . " Go lose yourself . " <p> Stefan began to retreat , gladly . <p> " Wait . What do you think of these shoes ? " <p> " They 're fine . " <p> She kicked them off , without a word , then opened the door behind the mirror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot upstairs . <p> Their honored guest and Mom remained in the kitchen . She was freshening her drink , and talking . <p> " I mean I really do n't care , " she told him . " I know I deserve the promotion , that 's what matters . " She gave her son a quick , troubled glance . " But Yankee says I should quit if they do n't give it to me  --  " <p> " Yankee ? " <p> " Yancy , I mean . I 'm sorry , it 's my husband 's nickname . " <p> The President was sitting on a projected stool , watching Mom sip her swirling drink once , then again . <p> " What do you think I should do ? Quit , or stay . " <p> " Wait and see , " was the President 's advice . " Perhaps you 'll get what you deserve . " <p> Mom offered a thin , dissatisfied smile . <p> Stefan thought of his comppad and his list of important questions . Where was it ? He wheeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his unmade bed , its patient voice repeating the same math problem over and over again . Changing functions , he returned to the kitchen . There 'd been enough noise about decorating and Mom 's job , he felt . " Mr. President ? Are we doing enough about the space program ? " <p> " Never , " was the reply . " I wish we could do more . " <p> Was the comppad recording ? Stefan fiddled with the controls , feeling a sudden dull worry . <p> " In my tenure , " the voice continued , " I 've been able to double our Martian budget . Spaceborn industries have increased twelve percent . We 're building two new observatories on the moon . And we just found life on Triton  --  " <p> " Titan , " the boy corrected , by reflex . <p> " Do n't talk to him that way ! " Mom glowered , thoroughly outraged . <p> " Oh , but the fellow 's right , Helen . I misspoke . " <p> The amiable laugh washed over Stefan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just an assignment for school , it was a mission , and he quickly scrolled to the next question . " What about the oceans , Mr. President ? " <p> A momentary pause , then their guest asked , " What do you mean. ? " <p> Stefan was n't sure . <p> " There are many issues , " said the President . " Mineral rights . Power production . Fishing and farming . And the floating cities  --  " <p> " The cities . " <p> " Fine . What do you think , Stefan ? Do they belong to us , or are they free political entities ? " <p> Stefan was n't sure . He glanced at his pad , thinking of the islands , manmade and covered with trim , modem communities . They grew their own food in the ocean , moved where they wanted , and seemed like wonderful places to live . " They should be free . " <p> " Why ? " <p> Who was interviewing whom ? <p> The President seemed to enjoy this reversal in roles . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and mine  --  then by what right can they leave the United States ? " A pleasant little laugh , then he added , " Imagine if the First Lady and I tried to claim the White House as an independent nation . Would that be right ? " <p> Stefan was at a loss for words . <p> Then Mom sat up straight , giving a sudden low moan . <p> Yancy was coming across the patio . Stefan saw him , and an instant later , Morn jumped to her feet , telling her son and guest , " No more politics . It 's dinnertime . " <p> Yancy entered the kitchen , approaching the projection from behind . <p> The President could n't react in time . Flesh-and-bone merged with him ; a distorted brown face lay over Yancy 's face , which was funny . <p> " Why are you laughing ? " snapped Yancy . <p> " No reason , " the boy lied . <p> His stepfather 's temper was close to the surface now . He dropped the plate of cooked burgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Show your guest to the dining room . Now . " <p> Taking his comppad , Stefan obeyed . <p> The President flickered twice , changing projectors . His voice flickered too , telling the boy the story of some unnamed Senator who threw a tantrum whenever rational discourse failed him . " Which is to say , " he added , " I have quite a lot of practice dealing with difficult souls . " And with that he gave a little wink and grin , trying to bolster the boy 's ragged mood . <p> Stefan barely heard him ; he was thinking of floating cities . <p> It occurred to him that he 'd answered , " Yes , they should be free , " for no other reason than that was his stepfather 's opinion , voiced many times . The cities were uncrowded . Some allowed only the best kinds of people . And Stefan had spoken without thinking , Yancy 's ideas worming their way inside him . Embarrassed and confused , he wondered what he believed that was really his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Stefan could think what he wanted , how important could his opinions ever be ? <p> The table was set for five , one place setting built from light . The President took his seat , and Stefan was across from him , scrolling through the comppad in search of new questions . Most of these came from his social studies teacher  --  a small , handsome Nigerian woman who did n't know Yancy . Why do we keep our open border policy ? He did n't dare ask it . Instead he coughed , then inquired , " How are your cats , Mr. President ? " <p> Both of them seemed happy with the new topic . " Fine , thank you . " Another wink and grin . " The jaguars are fat , and the cheetah is going to have triplets . " <p> Miniature breeds . Declawed and conditioned to be pets . <p> They spoke for a couple minutes about preserving rare species , Stefan mentioning his hope to someday work in that field . Then More burst into the room with her completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a second trip for the burgers . Somewhere en route he shouted , " Candace ! " and she appeared an instant later , making her entrance with a giggle and a bounce . <p> If anything , her boobs were even bigger . And the room 's holo projectors changed her skin , making it coffee-colored . <p> Mom saw the clothes and her color , then gave a shocked little groan . But she did n't dare say anything with the President here . Yancy entered the little room , paused and grimaced . . . then almost smiled , glancing at their guest with the oddest expression . <p> Why was n't he saying anything ? <p> The President glanced at Candace , for half a second . Then he looked straight ahead , eyes locked on Stefan . Big , worried eyes . And his projection reigned a slow sigh . <p> With her brown boobs spilling out , Candace sat beside President Perez . <p> Mom glared at her , then at Yancy . But Yancy just shook his head , as if warning her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate . The real ones were juicy ; the one built from light resembled a hard lump of charcoal . <p> Stefan realized that he was growing accustomed to being ashamed . <p> Candace took nothing but a small helping of salad , giggling and looking at their guest with the same goofy flirtatious face that she used on her infinite boyfriends . " Hey , are you having a good time ? " <p> " Mr. President , " Stefan added . <p> His sister glared at him , snapping , " I know that . " <p> " I 'm having a fine time . " The apparition never quite looked at her , using his spoon to build a mound of phantom beans on the phantom plate . " You have a lovely home . " <p> Mom said , " Thank you . " <p> Candace giggled , like an idiot . <p> But she was n't stupid , her brother wanted to say . To shout . <p> Yancy was preparing two burgers , slipping them into their pouches of bread and adding pickles , mustard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he grinned , telling the house computer to give them scenery . " Mount Rushmore , " he demanded . " The original . " <p> Squidskin recreated the four-headed landmark . Presidents Barker and Yarbarro were notably absent . <p> The current President was staring at his plate . For the first time , he acted remote . Detached . A bite of his charred burger revealed its raw red interior , blood flowing as if from an open wound . Aft era long pause , he looked at Stefan again , and with a certain hopefulness asked , " What 's your next question , please ? " <p> Candace squealed , " Let me ask it ! " <p> She shot to her feet , reaching over the table , her boobs fighting for the privilege of bursting out of her shirt . Before Stefan could react , she 'd stolen his comppad , reading the first question aloud . <p> " Why do we keep our open border policy ? " <p> The pause was enormous , silence coming from every direction at once . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else studied the President , wondering how he would respond . Except he did n't . It was Yancy who spoke first , in a voice almost mild . Almost . <p> " I do n't think it matters , " he replied . " I think if we want to do some good , we 've got to turn the flow back the other direction . If you know what I mean . " <p> " I think we do , " said President Perez . <p> " Fifty years of inviting strangers into our house . Fifty idiotic years of making room , making jobs , making allowances . . . and always making due with less and less . That 's what the great Barker gave us . Her and her damned open border bullshit ! " <p> Stefan felt sick . Chilled . <p> Mom began , " Now Yancy  --  " <p> " My grandfather owned an acreage , Mr. President . He ate meat three times a day , lived in a big house , and worked hard until he was told to go half-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job , and his paycheck . . . ! " <p> " Employment readjustments . " Their guest nodded , shrugged . " That 's a euphemism , I know . There were problems . Injustices . But think of the times , Mr. Thatcher . Our government was under enormous pressures , yet we managed to carry things off  --  " <p> " Some know-nothing refugee ! " Yancy repeated , his face red as uncooked meat . " And your party took his home , his land , needing the room for a stack of apartment buildings . " <p> Stefan tried not to listen . He was building a careful daydream where he had a different family , and he was sitting with the President , everyone working to make his visit productive , and fun . <p> Yancy pointed at the old Rushmore . " A great nation built it  --  " <p> " An individual built it , " the President interrupted . " Then his grateful nation embraced it . " <p> " A free nation ! " <p> " And underpopulated , speaking relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared , " We should have let you people starve . That 's what I think . " He took a huge breath , held it , then added , " You were n't our responsibility , and we should have shut our borders . Nothing in . Not you . Not a rat . Not so much as a goddamn fly . . . that 's my opinion . . . ! " <p> President Perez stared at his own clean plate . Eyes narrowed . The contemplative face showed a tiny grin , then he looked up at Yancy , eyes carved from cold black stone . <p> With a razored voice , he said , " First of all , sir , I 'm a third-generation U.S. citizen . And second of all , I believe that you 're an extraordinarily frightened man . " A pause , a quiet sigh . " To speak that way , your entire life must be torn with uncertainty . And probably some deep , deep sense of failure , I would guess . " <p> Stefan sat motionless , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy , Mr. Thatcher . . . well , let me just say this . These are the reasons why I believe you 're full of shit . " <p> The rebuke was steady , determined , and very nearly irresistible . <p> President Perez spoke calmly about war and famine , a desperate United Nations , and the obligations of wealthy people . He named treaties , reciting key passages word-for-word . Then he attacked the very idea of closing the borders , listing the physical difficulties and the economic costs . " Of course it might have worked . We could have survived . An enclave of privilege and waste , and eventually there would have been plagues and a lot of quiet hunger on the outside . We 'd be left with our big strong fences , and beyond them . . . a dead world , spent and useless to us , and to the dead . " A brief pause , then he spoke with a delicate sorrowful voice , asking , " Are you really the kind of man who could live lightly with himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you deserved a larger dining room . . . ? " <p> Yancy had never looked so tired . Of those at the table , he seemed to be the one composed of light and illusion . <p> The President smiled at everyone , then focused on Stefan . " Let 's move on , I think . What 's your next question ? " <p> The boy tried to read his comppad , but his brain would n't work . <p> " Perhaps you can ask me , ' What do you think about this hallmark evening ? ' " <p> " What do you think ? " Stefan muttered . <p> " It should revolutionize our government , which is n't any surprise . Our government was born from a string of revolutions . " He waited for the boy 's eyes , then continued . " I love this nation . If you want me angry , say otherwise . But the truth is that we are diverse and too often divided . My hope is that tonight 's revolution will strengthen us . Judging by these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least more honest . " <p> Yancy gave a low sound . Not an angry sound , not anything . <p> " Perhaps I should leave . " The President rose to his feet . " I know we 've got another half hour scheduled  --  " <p> " No , please stay ! " Mom blurted . <p> " Do n't go , " begged Candace , reaching for his dreadlocks . <p> Mom turned on her . At last . " Young lady , I want you out of those clothes  --  ! " <p> " Why ? " <p> "  --  and drain those breasts . You 're not fooling anyone here ! " <p> Candace did her ritual pout , complete with the mournful groan and the teary run to the basement . <p> Mom apologized to their guest , more than once . Then she told Yancy , " You can help Stefan clear the table , please . I will show our President the rest of my house . " <p> Stefan worked fast . Scraps went into the recyke system ; dishes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he saw the Grand Canyon passing into night , its blurry , imperfect edges more appropriate in the ruddy half-light . And it occurred to him that he was happy with this view , even if it was n't real . Happier than he 'd feel on any ordinary plot of real ground , surely . <p> His stepfather did no work . He just stood in the middle of the room , his face impossible to read . <p> Stefan left him to set the controls . Morn and the President were in the front room , looking outside . Or at least their eyes were pointed at the lone window . With a soft , vaguely conspiring tone , the President said , " It 's not my place to give advice . Friends can . Counselors and ministers should . But not someone like me , I 'm sorry . " <p> " I know , " his mother whispered . " It 's just . . . I do n't know . . . I just wish he would do something awful . To me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> What choice ? And who was she talking about ? <p> " But really , he only sounds heartless . " She tried to touch their guest , then thought better of it . " In five years , Yankee has n't lifted his hand once in anger . Not to the kids , or me . And you 're right , I think . About him being scared , I mean . . . . " <p> Stefan listened to every word . <p> " When you come next month , " More inquired , " will you remember what 's happened here ? " <p> President Perez shook his head . His face was in profile , like on a coin . " No , I wo n't . Your computer has to erase my personality , by law . And you really do n't have room enough to hold me . Sorry . " <p> " I guess not , " Mom allowed . <p> They looked outside , watching an airtaxi riding its cable past the window . The building across the street mirrored theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient , and lightweight , each house possessing its own yard and the same solitary window facing the maelstrom that was a city of barely five million . <p> Several Presidents were visible . <p> They waved at each other , laughing with a gentle , comfortable humor . <p> Then their President turned , spotting the boy at the other end of the little room , and he smiled at Stefan with all of his original charm and warmth , nothing else seeming to matter . <p> Mom turned and shouted , " Are you spying on us ? " <p> " I was n't , " he lied . " No , ma'am . " <p> The President said , " I think he just came looking for us . " Then he added , " Dessert . I feel like a little dessert , if I might be so bold . " <p> Mom was n't sure what to say , if anything . <p> " Perhaps something that looks delicious , please . In the kitchen . I very much liked your kitchen . " <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed as if ready for school , looking younger and flatter , and embarrassed . Yancy had reacquired a portion of his old certainty , but not enough to offer any opinions . Morn seemed wary , particularly of Stefan . What had he heard while eavesdropping ? Then the President asked for more questions , looking straight at Yancy , nothing angry or malicious in his dark face . <p> Crossing his arms , Yancy said nothing . <p> But Stefan thought of a question . " What about the future ? " It was n't from his comppad 's list ; it was an inspiration . " Mr. President ? How will the world change ? " <p> " Ah ! You want a prediction ! " <p> Stefan made sure that the comppad was recording . <p> President Perez took a playful stab at the layered sundae , then spoke casually , with an easy authority . <p> " What I 'm going to tell you is a secret , " he said . " But not a big one , as secrets go . " <p> Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the century began , every President has had an advisory council , a team of gifted thinkers . They know the sciences . They see trends . They 're experts in new technologies , history and human nature . We pay them substantial fees to build intelligent , coherent visions of tomorrow . And do you know what ? In eighty years , without exception , none of their futures have come true . " He shook his head , laughing quietly . " Predicted inventions usually appear , but never on schedule . And the more important changes come without warning , ruining every one of their assessments . " A pause , then he added , " My presence here , for instance . Not one expert predicted today . I know because I checked the records myself . No one ever thought that a President could sit in half a billion kitchens at once , eating luscious desserts that will never put a gram on his waist . " <p> Yancy growled , asking " Then why do you pay the bastards ? <p> " Habit ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because nothing they predict comes true , and I find that instructive . All these possible futures , and I do n't need to worry about any of them . " <p> A long puzzled silence . <p> " Anyway , " said the President , " my point is this : Now that we 've got this technology , every prediction seems to include it . In fact , my experts are claiming that in fifty years , give or take , all of us will spend our days floating in warm goo , wired into the swollen Net . Minimal food . No need for houses or transportation . Maximum efficiency for a world suddenly much less crowded . " He gazed at Stefan , asking " Now does that sound like an appealing future ? " <p> The boy shook his head . " No , sir . " <p> " It sounds awful , " Mom barked . <p> Candace said , " Ugh . " <p> Then Yancy said , " It 'll never happen . No . " <p> " Exactly , " said their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , if the pattern holds . " He took a last little bite of his sundae , then rose . " You asked for a prediction , son . Well , here it is . Your life will be an unending surprise . If you 're lucky , the surprises will be sweet and come daily , and that 's the best any of us can hope for . I think . " <p> The silence was relaxed . Contemplative . <p> Then the President gestured at the projected clock high above their stove . " Time to leave , I 'm afraid . Walk me out. ? " <p> He was speaking to Stefan . <p> Hopping off his stool , the boy hugged himself and nodded . " Sure , Mr. President . Sure . " <p> The Grand Canyon was dark , the desert sky clear and dry . But the genuine air was humid , more like Indiana than Arizona . There were always little clues to tell you where you were . Stefan knew that even the best systems fell short of being real . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You 'll come back in a month . Wo n't you , sir ? " <p> " Undoubtedly . " Another smile . " And thank you very much . You were a wonderful host . " <p> What else ? " I hope you had a good time , sir . " A pause , then he said , " It was perfect . Perfect . " Stefan nodded , trying to match that smile . <p> Then the image gave a faint , " Good-bye , " and vanished . He suddenly just was n't there . <p> Stefan stared at the horizon for a long moment , then turned and saw that the house was whole again . Their computer had enough power to add color and all the fancy touches . Under the desert sky , it looked tall and noble , and he could see the people sitting inside , talking now . Just talking . Nobody too angry or too sad , or anything . And it occurred to Stefan , as he walked up toward them , that people were just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and big thoughts . <p> People were never what they appeared to be , and it had always been that way . And always would be . <p> <p> By Robert Reed <p>
