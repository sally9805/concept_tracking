MOTHER MARY ANGELICA , now the owner of a cable television network , says she encountered her guardian angel when she was 11 . Crossing the street on the way home from school , she felt herself lifted by invisible hands out of the path of a car . Judging from the New York Times and Publisher 's Weekly bestseller lists , people crave such stories of angelic rescue . In the current deluge of angel books  --  as well as in recent television specials about angels  --  such narratives are prominently featured . Has the number of guardian angels suddenly proliferated ? one wonders . Or are they newly inclined to reveal themselves and involve themselves in our lives , as many of these books claim ? The angel stories seem to fall into predictable patterns . Perhaps the most common element is a traffic hazard . ( How did an gels occupy themselves before the invention of the automobile ? asks one commentator . ) When they are not lifting us out of harm 's way , angels are busy rescuing motorists in stalled cars or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angel appears in human form to guide a person who is in a strange place and unsure of her direction . Then there are stories about people being threatened by gangs , hostile tribes or armies who are protected by angels invisible to themselves but seen by their enemies . And there are frequent stories about people who , while grieving the death of a loved one , meet a stranger who silently sympathizes with them , comforts them and then disappears . The similarity of the narratives raises a question . Is there a kind of collective unconscious at work that makes people interpret puzzling experiences according to certain patterns ? Or in attempting to make sense of what happens to us , do we adapt models of miraculous experiences that we have already heard ? How should we evaluate this outpouring of angel stories ? In the early 1970s , when Billy Graham decided to preach a sermon on angels , he found that little had been published on the subject in this century . The book he wrote , Angels : God 's Secret Agents ( Word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has remained Graham 's most popular volume . Several books on the subject followed during the ' ' 80s , notably Mortimer Adler 's The Angels and Us ( Macmillan ) and Geddes MacGregor 's Angels : Ministers of Grace ( Paragon House ) . THIS STEADY but specialized interest has turned into a wildly popular trend : during the past five years the number of angel books in print in the U.S. has gone from five to at least 200 , according to Gannett News Service . Reading some of the angel books crowding the bookstores is like devouring a box of chocolates . The books ' glossy , old-embossed covers , decorated with gorgeous angels , have the appeal of prettily wrapped bonbons , and the large print surrounded by lots of white space promises that the content will go down easily . If nothing else , the angel phenomenon indicates that philosophical materialism  --  the belief that nothing exists but corporeal substances occupying physical space  --  has not triumphed in American culture . As Adler states , " The notion of angels  --  of minds totally devoid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are hungry for the spiritual , for the miraculous , for assurances of a realm beyond the corporeal . " If we do n't read our Bibles too carefully , angels seem to be friendly folks , " says Lawrence S. Cunningham , chair of Notre Dame 's department of theology . And because they are spiritual realities , we can impose on them any character we want . In an age so marked by a sense of stress and crisis , what image could be more comforting than that of a powerful , loving guardian who is always by our side , ready to comfort and protect , and reluctant judge or reprimand us ? The special popularity of angels at Christmas suggests that they function as a kind of Santa Claus for grownups . Perhaps celebrating a Christmas without religious meaning leaves secular folk feeling empty , and angels fill that void , suggesting the mystery , warmth and magic that reindeer , elves and St. Nick hold for children . And they are just as easily sentimentalized . In A Gathering of Angels : Angels in Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Kansas City rabbi , points out that in Israel 's history , belief in angels blossomed during times of exile or foreign dominance , when people felt that God had withdrawn far from them because of their sinfulness . During such times , angels acted as intermediaries , carrying people 's prayers to God . In our age , too , people look for intermediaries and for evidence that the divine still intervenes in some way in our lives . Angels seem more accessible than God , and more attractive . And while there is only one Cod , there are many angels  --  so many that we can each have a private angel devoted to our welfare . In Angel Letters ( Ballantine ) , Sophie Burnham tells us that angels " pour their blessing on us overwhelmingly . They play with us . They look after us . They heal us , comfort us with invisible warm hands , and always they try to give us what we want . " Angels also adapt to a variety of worldviews ; People who embrace evolutionary thinking push the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than humanity . Beings who seem incorporeal to us might be the next stage in the evolutionary process  --  a stage already reached by some , though we are only partially aware of them . Followers of New Age religions , who believe we are on the threshold of a great expansion of consciousness and human development , find it easy to believe in angels without believing in God . We can develop angel consciousness , they assure us . We can create with our angels . We can channel them . They are beneficent spirits , devoted to our growth and welfare . The ecologically concerned might well resonate to the idea that each natural object has its own angel , dedicated to its preservation and welfare . Others will be attracted to the assertion that angels are universal . " Angels transcend every religion , every philosophy , every creed , " Eileen Elias Freeman tells us . And Christians , of course , can find ample warrant for belief in angels in scripture and tradition . WHATEVER THE reasons for the surge of interest in angels , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Book of Angels , released in 1990 , surprised Ballantine by becoming a runaway bestseller . Recognizing a profitable market , Ballantine put out a series of angel books , as did several other publishers . One can find them in store windows surrounded by terra cotta angels , painted angel plaques , angel pins and angel calendars . A typical work is The Angel Book ( Simon &; Schuster ) , by Karen Goldman . As kitschy as the artifacts that surround it , this slender volume is composed primarily of little phrases about angels : " The only way to know an angel is by your feeling , " it tells us . " An angel is like an open window . " " Being an angel is like being in love . " Quite different from this kind of nonbook but just as obviously inspired by the desire to wing it to the bank is Literary Angels ( Ballantine ) , edited by Harriet Scott Chessman . Chessman assembles an eclectic mix of poems , stories and letters in which the word " angel " appears or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find an organizing principle for the book suggests the haste with which it was put together . Angels Among Us ( Avon ) , by Don Fearheiley , exhibits a different gimmick . He takes accounts of angel visits that have appeared in print or on television , changes names and places , and develops the stories as sagas of family relations , romance and sex  --  always somehow ending with the protagonist 's encounter with an angel . Religious publishers have been lured to get on the bandwagon . When I called one to ask for a review copy of one of its offerings , the publicist exclaimed , " Are you sure the CENTURY wants to review that book ? " It too turned out to be a haphazard arrangement of angel stories and sentimental religious verse . THE PROMINENCE of the profit motive is only one of the problems with the angel phenomenon . More serious is the way so many angel booh pander to the human pride and egocentrism from which religious faith has always tried to wean us . Burnham 's books are a prime example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us . Angels , she tells us , always bring " a calm and peaceful serenity that descends sweetly over you . " Their message is always " Do n't worry . . . . Things are working out perfectly . You 're going to like this . " Angels are the agents of a benign , anthropocentric order , like divine genies . Their mission is to give us what we want . Similarly , the meditations in Terry Lynn Taylor and Mary Beth Crain 's Angel Wisdom ( Harper-San Francisco ) tell us that we have an angel consciousness , " the consciousness that we are divine , that we have a higher wisdom that will always operate for the good , that life is meant to be enjoyed . " Burnham goes on to declare that we do n't have to believe in God in order to pray . rather , like gravity , is a law of the universe , and if we do it right our prayers are answered " instantly , with an abundance of delight ; for it is the pleasure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this happy cosmos , there is no need for people to look out for each other , to work for justice , or to wrestle with evil . Stroked by angel wings , we can rest in a warm , nurturing natural world . " To move angels center stage is to trivialize Christianity , " Cunningham says , a contention most of the recent angel books readily bear out . Even a devout Catholic like Freeman , who in Touched by Angels ( Warner ) repeatedly reminds us that angels come from God and point us to God , has only the most vapid things to say about God . Though she is quite sure about how angels are working in the world today , all she tells us about Cod is that God is love , and that we search for God by examining ourselves and writing down everything about " however we conceive him , her , it to be . " We then continue our search by using prayer and meditation techniques " from any tradition that can properly relax and discipline the physical body so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For some people such a boo may be a first step toward religious faith , but in itself it is Pablum . Many of these books also trivialize angels . For most writers , only guardian angels exist . And these guardians sometimes perform remarkably trivial tasks , such as helping a tired mother change the sheets on her child 's bed . Even the best of the books that focus on stories of angelic encounters , such as those by Joan Wester Anderson , do not evaluate these narratives . All too often , the angelic encounter seems to result in little more than a warm feeling . Only occasionally does it transform lives or turn people outward in service . The books present angels in our own image . Though angels are sinless spirits , they understand and sympathize with us . They differ from us only in ways that can benefit us . And , paradoxically , these spiritual beings seem to be more concerned with our physical than our spiritual welfare . Finally , much of the recent angel lore is at odds with Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spirit . Angels are superior to humans because they are pure spirit , many of the books suggest . Some claim that angels are the spirits of those who have died , while others suggest that one of the main angelic tasks is to help the souls of the dying separate from their bodies and to escort the souls to heaven . The Christian understanding that we are physical beings who will be resurrected in glorified bodies is missing from modern angelology . BUT THOUGH the glut of angel books may make serious Christians feel a little nauseous , some of them are worth some attention . A number of these are reissues of earlier volumes , most notably Graham 's , Adler 's and MacGregor 's . Another significant reissue , Doubleday 's Angels and Awakenings : Stories of the Miraculous by Great Modern Writers , would make a fine gift . Doubleday 's Angels in Our Midst , compiled by the editors of Guideposts and originally published in 1993 as Angels Among Us , has two useful sections not found in other recent volumes : a summary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stories about ordinary people who , by living Christian lives , act as " angels " to others . ( Many angel books seem to assume that acts of kindness or rescue must b performed by supernatural beings . ) Joan Wester Anderson 's lovely children 's book , An Angel to Watch Over Me ( Ballantine ) , contains well-told , appealing and genuinely religious " true stories of children 's encounters with angels . " Stories of guardian angels seem to fit more appropriately with the lore of childhood . Perhaps this present tide of angel interest is " part of a great revival of spirituality in America . " as Freeman claims . Perhaps it is " an opportunity for us to realign our priorities and choose the pathway of the divine rather than the pathway of materialism , " as Kay Martin Curry , founder of Twenty-eight Angels Inc. , hopes . But my march through the thickets of contemporary angelology makes me agree with Maurice Smith , who sees the interest in angels as " not necessarily a sign of spiritual awakening .
