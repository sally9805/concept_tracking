A psychologist talks about the addiction her own profession feeds . <p> JULIA IS AN ART TEACHER , EARLY FIFTYISH , THRICE divorced , the mother of four adult children , living at present with an itinerant carpenter twelve years her junior . Today she 's five minutes late for her appointment . When she finally swoops in , I 'm reminded of an old photograph of Isadora Duncan . I see a tall woman , pale , wraithlike , sandaled , wearing a blood-colored shawl over a pancake-whitened grimace. * <p> Julia wastes no time letting me know the bad tidings . She has no inkling , she says , simply ca n't understand , why her so-called psychic fatigue ( for which no medical etiology has been found , and because of which her current physician has referred her to me ) has laid her low again . She 's been doing all the right things : sitting Zazen , paying careful attention to the state of her chakras , attending her weekly Coda meeting , which is always marvelously " life-affirming . " <p> Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could n't move . It took every ounce of strength to pull on a skirt . That 's why she looks such a mess , has n't even bothered to comb her hair . On the way over , she happened to hear some stress expert on a talk show , rating the twelve worst stressors that people have to face ; she came out with a terrible score . Maybe that could be a clue ? She certainly has no idea why , after so long , this awful fatigue has come back to haunt her again . And she 's still not convinced that she does n't have something physical . ( A forwarded copy of her medical records shows successive and negative diagnoses from an endocrinologist , a neurologist , a gynecologist . ) The other day , she was reading about Epstein-Barr . You could have it and not know it ; medical tests might not even show it . So how can anybody know for sure whether what she has is physical or not ? At this point , her tone falters , her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JULIA , OF COURSE , IS A COMPOSITE CASE CONJURED UP OUT of details from my current casebook file . Yet I 've seen many Julia sound-alikes  --  in my office , in hospital and clinical settings , in the open-air asylum of our local streets , in churches , schools , and living rooms . And even though I 've only transcribed the mere beginnings of an initial interview , already there is much , I think , to infer about the patient . <p> Her visit is not unusual : Many of the people whom I see keep " recycling " themselves in just this way , traveling from healer to healer , embarking , consciously or not , on what Dr. G. Gayle Stephens , a distinguished medical educator , once called " careers of illness . " ( The number of clients coming to me who 've never been in therapy before is minuscule , around 2 percent . ) <p> From her history , she seems to have been a sporadic , hit-and-run user of various services . This may make her a doubtful candidate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , necessarily involving a substantial investment of time , and harking back to the roots of present vicissitudes , with a nowadays antiquarian accent on the why of symptoms rather than the how of getting rid of them . <p> Whatever stasis she 's achieved seems to have been accomplished by means of an intricate scaffolding of magic , a regimen of daily exorcisms . What demons does this protect her from ? And how can one guarantee her protection from " reprisal , " while weaning her away from that obstacle course of prophylactic ritual she seems to crave , in order to encourage her to spell out the demon 's name ? William Blake warned us centuries ago about the dangers of challenging the mysteries of any faith too closely ( " If the Sun and Moon should doubt/They 'd immediately go out " ) . And so for Julia . Too empathetic a reception may merely prolong her speaking in " therapeutic tongues " ; too skeptical a response is apt to plunge her into instant fury and feelings of rejection . In the latter case , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those other Ghosts of Therapists Past , from whom she expected so much , and who 've all ended up predictably , and expensively , " failing " her . <p> AFTER HER INITIAL ONSLAUGHT , JULIA SEEMS TO SUBSIDE . She sits , sullen , chin dropped , defensive in posture , arms crossed over her breasts , eyes flickering restlessly , now alighting on a table , on bookshelves , on the entrance way  --  but never on me . Obviously , we still have to make contact . Yet it is not fatigue that her image conveys , so much as despair , something nerveless and bleak behind that initial cataract of words . I sense that she is waiting to be pierced , as it were , by the kind of jugular question that , in the past , has licensed her to vomit all over again the details of her unhappy history . <p> But I do n't ask questions , not yet . Though the impulse to comfort , to utter reassuring words , is strong , I struggle to keep silent . Leston Havens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fertile silence during the initial interview ; he likens it to the surgeon 's careful preparation before the first incision . Such a silence , according to Havens , is indispensable as a prelude to a truly reciprocal dialogue . For one thing , it can allow the sense of a " healing presence " to well up for the patient . And it also permits a background knowledge of who a patient really is to float intuitively into the consciousness of the therapist , over and beyond that foreground chatter of reasons , interpretations , and clinical formulations , which most of us are only too primed to offer . This chronic " thirst to explain , " as Havens calls it , is one of the hardest things to resist , I find , amid the activist hubbub of intervention and response in much present-day practice . <p> Finally , I attempt to make a signaling gesture . I position my chair so that Julia and I are now sitting side by side ; it is a posture meant to invoke solidarity , mutual alliance in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convey , of course , is the notion of sanctuary . My whole demeanor is intended to suggest that here at last , for a short while , she wo n't need to be on guard , can let her defenses down . Her secrets will be protected ; her demons wo n't be let in . Within the walls of my consulting room , she 'll be safe . <p> " People really do n't have an idea sometimes how hard things can be for other people , " I say , as if musing aloud . Julia sits up , blinks . She suddenly seems surprised to discover , as though peering through a window abruptly opened , a mere fellow being ( as well as a therapist ) sitting next to her . " And how does one tell them ? " I ask . Now Julia looks in my direction . Her eyes glisten ; tears flow . <p> But this time , they are not angry or polemical tears . She seems to be weeping more out of relief at being acknowledged just as herself rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment plan . " It 's really .... I mean , you really ca n't ... , " she begins . I look at her , evenly . I really ca n't what ? " Well , everyone knows , " Julia murmurs . Falters . " Everyone knows , I mean , that stress can cause cancer  --  is n't that so ? " she asks . And bursts once more into tears . <p> IT 'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT , whatever concealed catch-22s are found entrapping Julia in her repetitive lockstep of prayer , purge , rage , and fatigue , she has also become a chronic cultural casualty : a victim of the profitable growth and entrepreneurial triumph of that burgeoning flotilla of well stocked , appealingly " karmic , " cash-or-credit-card magic shows flooding the country . <p> Whether franchised or free-lance , these shows are apt to be loaded with telegenic wizards , live seers , and mail-order curanderos ready to ward off whatever phantom villains or microbes may be diagnosed as the root cause of a long-standing complaint , by prescribing a remedial regimen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , the use of do-it-yourself improvement kits , and the purging of a variety of " toxins "  --  social , familial , nutritional , and astral . In this way , sufferers like Julia are often condemned to living perpetual reruns of their roles as victims . As a result , they 're sometimes driven to prolong their pain and anguish , beyond the point where it ought , humanly , to be borne . <p> The current popular damnation of stress mirrored in so many weekend workshops , each tirelessly competing for a larger share of the human retread market , seems a direct consequence of the Reagan era , when the whole cult of wellness worship really took off . The booming antistress industry , in fact , is nothing but an outgrowth of this wellness crusade , accurately described by Dr. Howard E Stein , a medical anthropologist , as : <p> ... that obsessive preoccupation with health that goes by the term " wellness . " It is one among many contemporary expressions of a narcissistic inward turning that follows a sense of frightened impotence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and goal of wellness programs and participants is that of self-control . One seeks to exercise control over himself in order to shore up his fragile , vulnerable boundaries , to be able to influence the permeability of these boundaries-to keep all goodness within and all badness outside .. , the danger is that instead o f facing the self and finding it flawed , vulnerable , frightened-human , all too human-we will turn to some convenient other or others i.e. , guru , soothsayer , prophet , workshop leader , etc. and locate our problems and their solutions in them . <p> In this connection , I recall , years ago , a group session , devoted to the theme of nuclear anxiety , conducted by a very earnest therapist . At the outset she made a disclaimer : She was not there to be " political . " We were merely gathering to share our worries , tell our stories , support one another , not let our " political " prejudices hang out . The result was a reduction ad absurdum of the clinical process . Each exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was deflected ; every incipient debate about causes , means , details , etc. , was cut off . There was a great deal of the usual strenuous routing of emotional traffic ( " **42;562;TOOLONG " and " Tell- her-what - you-  **29;606;TOOLONG " ) . <p> It was all desultory , dwarfed , trivialized , aborted at the very moment that it began to deal with the struggle to reshape events in the wider " political " world . We were left with a kind of repetitive , inconclusive keening , without any criteria for judging how closure might be made , how warranted everybody 's lamentations were , and what possibilities for imminent action might , or might not , be feasible . I was reminded of various nineteenth-century lithographs showing practitioners opening patients ' veins to let the blood out . Bloodletting doubtlessly made the practitioner feel better . It may have even made the sufferer , by inducing a spasm of hope , feel better . But the disease itself , whether cholera in the nineteenth century or nuclear dread in the twentieth , was certain to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ONE OF HIS NINETEENTH-CENTURY American travel diaries , Rudyard Kipling described a Fourth-of-July burning-in-effigy of a scowling straw scarecrow derisively labeled I. M. FULLER GLOOM . To be gloomy , Kipling concluded incredulously , seemed not merely bad form in this country  --  it practically amounted to an unpatriotic act . Earlier , Longfellow had issued his famous summons ( chanted by successive generations of dutiful schoolchildren ) , " Let us , then , be up and doing . " And decades later , a renowned Yankee tinkerer put Longfellow 's precept into large-scale action , at the same time handing us another populist maxim . " History is more or less bunk , " cried Henry Ford , patriarch of the Model T. <p> The past seems to have seeded our native psyche with a legacy of surreptitious moral injunction . In the deep recesses of our inherited legends and myths seem to be ancestral voices telling us that it 's our birthright to be happy , it 's our duty to take arms against adversity , by heeding the examples and words of our pragmatic statesmen-achievers , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world for markets , conjuring up nuclear scenarios , or saving souls on TV . These are the same ancestral messages , of course , resurrected and reinvented by the present-day tribe of wellness and antistress entrepreneurs , that many weary relief-seekers , shrinking from too painful or prolonged self-examination and confronting day-to-day " existential " dilemmas , find so difficult to resist . <p> I recall a couple in their late seventies , referred to me by an exasperated family physician because the wife , an overweight diabetic , was chronically noncompliant with her prescribed diet . She 'd previously suffered additional medical misfortunes , a broken elbow , which was taking forever to heal , and a successful heart bypass operation , which she still complained about . Worse , she 'd lately taken to staying in bed several hours each day , enthralled by a TV preacher who had been vouchsafed , he said , a vision of a " secret " underground spring in Turkey with undisclosed curative powers . He was organizing a pilgrimage to the area . The physician , concerned about the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The husband , a retired mechanic , poohpoohed the idea , but it was clear from talking to him on the phone that he was furious about something else . The minute they entered my office , he made the reason plain . " I want sex and she do n't , " he announced , as if that were the root of their troubles . <p> It turned out that he 'd been forced to turn into a nearly full-time cook , housecleaner , and nurse ( he gave his wife her daily insulin shot ) . He hardly had time anymore to putter around with his beloved collection of vintage cars . So he saw his own retirement being unfairly spoiled : his finances diminishing ; his children fled to different states ; and himself a potential victim of the " spend-down " syndrome , by which the elderly sick must impoverish themselves before they can get the specific medical help they need , should serious illness or prolonged hospitalizations occur . <p> More than fifty years had bound this couple to one another in obvious ties of loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and farther away from that shared bounty of memory and experience that was supposed to have been the boon of their retirement years . They listened with uneasy respect while ! ran through the down side of the televangelist 's " healing expedition " : its physical wear and tear , probable cost , and dim prospects . I then recited a litany of relevant agencies , affinity groups , and outside activities available to them locally . I even managed to secure the name of a local square-dance group , after I learned that square dancing had been one of the enthusiasms of their earlier years . At last , the husband put his hand on my arm . " Lady , " he said gently , looking into my eyes , " I appreciate your concern . But with all due respect , there 's nothing to do . The wife 's not going to get better , the money 's dribbling away , our old age is shot ! It 's life that 's doing it to us  --  it 's not something you can cure . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene from a future envisioned long ago . " Though , if you want to know what I dream these days-I dream a lot about being a youngster and starting over , " he said . <p> MANY OF MY CLIENTS CLING TO EDENLIKE dreams of starting over , of being given a second chance . But while deciding to be " born again " in rebirthing seminars or at evangelical rallies is clear evidence of a latent discontent stemming from a felt lack or need , falling physically ill can also amount to a form of protest . In this case , the body does the testifying . <p> Several years ago , when I was director of cross-cultural medicine in a family-practice residency program , I was struck by how many patients , most of them Spanish-speaking field hands , would complain of headaches , stomachaches , chills , " floating " pains , etc. , for which no medical etiology could be found . The resident physicians were also struck by the same fact . They were troubled , too , when I pointed out how many complaints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutal working conditions , poor schools , slum housing , cultural isolation , psychological illegitimacy  --  things we could n't very well treat in our clinic . Official policy was to award " courtesy disease labels " for these cases  --  " depression , .... melancholia , " " suicidal ideation " - primarily to cover possible legal contingencies , but also to satisfy the medical workers ' craving to feel in control , bolstering their clinical confidence , which was threatened when they could n't attach a professional-sounding label to a symptom or enter some nomenclature on a chart . <p> The same thing occurs in private practice . I often see patients with complaints whose origins are largely sociogenic : unresponsive institutions , alienating work circumstances , occupational stress , arbitrary job displacements . Such conditions do make people , as a medical anthropologist has written , " angry , bitter , and sick . " Yet many times , I 'm required to award " courtesy disease labels " myself , either to enable clients to receive insurance benefits , and get reimbursed , or provide easily decodable data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we play . Certainly this casts a mordant light on our primitive need to label and thus " understand " what , in many respects , is the still largely uncharted realm of behavioral and psychic disorders . And it also illustrates the way in which our lives as professionals sometimes quarantine us from the " contamination " of that larger world where we and our patients ultimately have to cope , as best we can , with the apocryphal issues we face as parents , citizens , teachers , dreamers , and friends . <p> WHEN HE LAY DOWN HIS ORIGINAL Protocol for the patient-practitioner encounter nearly a century ago , Sigmund Freud had a warning : Let yourself be surprised ! By imposing a premature grid of meaning on what 's said , or not allowing enough time for memory play , or not waiting to catch the drift of words unspoken , he suggested , we can foreclose the potential for surprise and thus condemn the patient to the kind of labeling that I 've just described . <p> It is the surprises occurring in therapy , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are among the most rewarding experiences in my practice . And they are very often happy surprises . Frequently I 'm amazed at the things that my clients , in spite of all they 've suffered , are able to come up with . <p> One time , unexpectedly , a depressive wife brought in an angrily eloquent poem describing in minute detail the brutal marital rape she 'd been submitting to , helplessly , for decades . Suddenly , reciting it out loud in my office , hearing it spoken in public for the first time before a " stranger , " she seemed able to view herself as beyond her recurrent nightmare , unshackled from it rather than imprisoned within it , and no longer willing to put up with the chronic brutality she 'd been bearing in secret for years . <p> Then there 's the retired mechanic I 've already mentioned , , who had plunged into seemingly incorrigible despair over the condition of his fitfully bedridden wife . Recently , I saw him at the wheel of a Meals On Wheels van . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife  --  at least thirty-five pounds lighter  --  perched on the seat beside him . She told me that , one day , on impulse , her husband had called the dance-group number that I 'd given them . That very weekend , they 'd been invited to a hoedown . Somehow , by some miracle , her husband had pried her out of bed . Since then , they 'd been stomping , twirling , and marching , elbows entwined , two or three times a week . They seemed to have discovered not only their old enthusiasm for square dancing , but a community as well . That 's how she lost all that weight . " You ca n't expect a person like me to do-si-do when they 're carrying three spare tires , " the wife said . The husband grimaced , his eyes twinkling . " Ah , listen to her ! Never knows when to quit moving her mouth ! For your information , the woman still hates sex , " he went on , giving his wife a roguish , gentle poke in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapist  --  along with the faith expressed in their possibilities by others . Physicist Freeman Dyson , for instance , deplores what he has called the " Eeyore Syndrome , " taken from A. A. Milne 's Winnie-the-Pooh . Eeyore is the donkey who looks at his reflection in a stream , first from one direction , then from another , all the while sighing : " Pathetic , that 's what it is . Pathetic . " This is the precise message , I 'm afraid , that too many resigned people give out these days , as they contemplate their sorrows or " defective " images in the glass . <p> Dyson asks us to thumb our noses at the Eeyore Syndrome . He opts for comedy over tragedy . The comic hero , he reminds us , is apt to get in a million scrapes and is nearly done for time after time . Yet through the use of courage , cunning , will , wit , and even luck , he still , sometimes , against terrific odds , manages to come through . Many of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitate comic heroes whose business is not " noble " suffering or meaningless sacrifice or symbolic suicide , but survival , zest for the struggle to achieve a last-minute victory over arbitrary quotas of pain and disappointment , joy in the consolations of our human connection as well as exaltation at the bittersweet radiance , the dazzling plenitude , of life itself . <p> This certainly sounds bracing enough . Yet how can I reconcile it with a chronic repeater like Julia , who can hardly get out of bed ? Frankly , the chances of her turning into one of Dyson 's heroic comedians appear remote . She 's still whirling in a closed circle , plagued by terrors induced in part by the variety of treatments previously offered , and tyrannized by a recurrent fatigue , which those " cures " have fleetingly lifted . The mush and blur of her earlier attempts have only reduced her faith in ever finding a connection between the pain and panic she 's going through and the crucial words needed to focus their meanings and thus ultimately explain , dissolve , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kleenex box at the ready , demanding something of me , although not yet convinced that I 'm capable of giving it . It 's doubtful whether I will be able to get her to abandon her fantasy fortress soon , if ever . And her resistance , at times , could get tricky . She may freak out , break appointments , tearfully accuse me of nonexistent crimes , repent imaginary sins , grab at the latest feel-good chimera that the happiness biz tempts her with , and finally decide , as her mood changes and her confidence grows , to reveal-or not reveal-whatever atrocious " secrets " she may have been zealously guarding for decades . <p> At this point , I have no choice but to make a signaling gesture , move closer , and let Julia know she will be safe with me . The compact implicit in this overpopulated , caricatured , and quixotic calling of which I am part makes such a gesture mandatory . Nancy Scheper-Hughes , a medical anthropologist at U.C. Berkeley , and her colleague Margaret Lock of McGill University have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written to address the humanness of human suffering , the difficulties in keeping a patient 's whole experience in steady view : <p> All of us can be open and responsive to the hidden language of pain and protest .. , or we can-cut it off by relegating our complaints to the ever-expanding domains of medicine ( " it " is in the body ) or psychiatry ( " it " is in your mind ) .... Once safely medicalized , however , the social issues are short-circuited , and the desperate message in the bottle is lost . <p> The woman who can hardly get out of bed in the morning is agonized by a search she has yet to discover how to make ; her previous failures have only added to her load . Now it is my fate , apparently , for reasons still unclear , to have been recruited as a co-explorer . Yet sooner or later , our quests must converge . Both of us , of course , will ultimately be searching for the same thing : the " message in the bottle .
