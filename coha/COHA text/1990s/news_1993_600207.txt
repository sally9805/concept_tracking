<p> KANSAS CITY , Mo . A few things about the 1993 NCAA men 's basketball tournament are apparent . <p> Rider , Wright State , East Carolina , Coppin State and 15 other conference champions to date are resting easy . Their invitations are engraved and in hand . <p> Two of the four top seeds , in the East and Midwest , are reserved for No. 1-ranked North Carolina and No. 2 Indiana . Their conferences , the Atlantic Coast and Big Ten , are about to claim six spots apiece in the 64-team field . And the Big Eight could claim another six . Independents , for the second year in a row , will claim none . <p> But it 's the unknown that dominates this weekend . Drives it . Delivers it , ultimately , to a climactic Sunday evening ( 6 : 30 p.m . ET , CBS ) , when nine members of the NCAA 's selection committee emerge from a Kansas City hotel suite , step in front of the TV cameras , pull back a curtain and reveal who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoops heaven . Or from another vantage point , pure purgatory . <p> " There are going to be some disappointed teams , " Kansas State coach Dana Altman says . " There always are . " <p> Will his be one ? Five Big Eight teams appear to be shoo-ins , and 17-9 K-State can make a strong case for being a sixth : a 20-point rout of Temple , league wins at Oklahoma State and Nebraska and a two-game sweep of Oklahoma , an overall 6-5 record against teams in the top 50 of the NCAA 's Ratings Percentage Index ( RPI ) . <p> " We deserve to be in the tournament , " Altman says . " However , I do n't have a vote in the matter . So we 've got to go to the Big Eight tournament ( where the Wildcats open today against Nebraska ) and try to get some more votes . " <p> The Big Eight is one of 12 conference tournaments to be played this weekend , all forwarding their winners to the NCAA . The second-year Great Midwest does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with three representatives . And the three Division I leagues without end-of-season tournaments the Big Ten , Pacific 10 and Ivy conclude their regular seasons . <p> Sizing things up , both the knowns and unknowns : <p> ACC : The granddaddy of conference tournaments means little this year . Six teams are virtually assured of NCAA berths and , whether it wins the ACC 's postseason title or not , North Carolina likely will hang onto its No. 1 seed in the East . A potential Florida State-Duke semifinal could decide which stays in the NCAA Southeast as a No. 2 seed and which is shipped to the West as a No. 3 . <p> If Duke does land in the Southeast , and if Kentucky is the region 's No. 1 seed , as anticipated , brace for the hype . It would set up a potential regional-final rematch of their classic , overtime thriller a year ago , won by the Blue Devils 104-103 on Christian Laettner 's shot as the buzzer sounded . <p> Atlantic 10 : Both of Thursday 's tournament finalists , Massachusetts and Temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team after beating George Washington in the opening round , leaving the Colonials on the NCAA fence probably one of a handful vying for the final at-large berth . <p> GWU 's power rating is good ( No. 27 ) , and it won at Temple . The Colonials own no other wins of similar stature , but could benefit from Thursday 's losses by Florida and Arizona State . <p> Big East : Its tournament is a free-for-all , with one and perhaps two of its four likely NCAA berths yet to be settled . Pittsburgh appears in good shape but would erase any doubt with a Friday victory against Syracuse . Bid No. 4 is up for grabs among fast-closing Providence and Connecticut , which meet Friday , and struggling Boston College . <p> Could Syracuse , allowed to play in the Big East tournament despite probation and ineligibility for the NCAA tournament , cost a co-member an NCAA berth ? <p> Big West : Both Nevada-Las Vegas and the selection committee are in interesting positions . The Rebels ' credentials are not strong two wins against middling Marquette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would slip more with an early-round Big West tournament loss . But they 're 20-6 overall , have been ranked all season , and the committee must tread delicately around the long-running , finally cooling feud between the school and the NCAA 's enforcement staff . <p> Count the Rebels in , along with regular-season champion New Mexico State . <p> Midwestern Collegiate : If there 's one mid-major conference champion that can withstand an upset in its league tournament , it 's Xavier ( Ohio ) . <p> Pacific 10 : California 's late surge has moved the Bears past Arizona State in the race for a third NCAA berth , behind Arizona and UCLA . Can ASU pull out a fourth ? In all likelihood , nothing less than a final-series sweep of UCLA and Southern Cal would do , and they fell Thursday to UCLA . The Sun Devils also are saddled with a trio of unsettling losses : by 26 points at Louisville , 30 at Washington State and 36 at Arizona . <p> Southeastern : Kentucky needs to win the SEC tournament at home in Rupp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Vanderbilt title probably would give it to the Commodores . <p> Count Arkansas in the NCAA field , too , but a fourth berth is yet to be claimed . Florida and Louisiana State were the most likely candidates , but the Gators lost in Thursday 's SEC opening round . <p> One possible surprise fell through Thursday : Auburn , which swept Arkansas and won five of its last six regular-season games , lost to Tennessee . <p> Southwest : As up in the air as any conference in the USA . Is regular-season champ Southern Methodist a safe NCAA bet if it happens to lose its Friday SWC tournament opener to Texas Christian ? Probably . If the Mustangs win the tournament and neither of the regular-season runners-up , Houston and Rice , reaches the final , could the low-rated league be limited to one berth ? Possibly . <p> If . . . if . . . if . Another three days ' worth . <p> The NCAA selection committee , which arrived in Kansas City late Thursday , began sorting them out Friday . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll play where and when . <p> " It affects a lot of lives and a lot of programs and a lot of kids , " chairman Tom Butters said . " To take it anything other than seriously would be inappropriate .
