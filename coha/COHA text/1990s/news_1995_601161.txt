<p> Think of the most imposing single-season record in major sports and try to imagine it being surpassed . <p> Joe DiMaggio 's 56-game hitting streak ? Well , Pete Rose got to 44 in 1978 , and with the quality of pitching deteriorating , sure , that record could be broken . <p> Wilt Chamberlain 's 100-point NBA game in ' 62 ? David Thompson scored 73 in ' 78 , and that was before the three-point field goal . Not probable , but possible . <p> Most football records do n't jump as quickly to mind , but how about Tom Dempsey 's 63-yard field goal ? Ernie Nevers ' 40 points in a game ( six touchdowns and four extra points in 1929 ) or Lenny Moore scoring a touchdown in 18 consecutive games over a three-year span ? Again , not likely but possible . <p> The one record you can bet your mortgage will never be broken is Byron Nelson 's 11 consecutive pro golf victories in 1945 . On the PGA Tour this year , the highlight was Peter Jacobsen winning two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackie Burke Jr . in 1952 ; he won four . <p> Nelson is being honored for the 50th anniversary of " The Streak " before the GTE Byron Nelson Classic starts Thursday at Irving , Texas . Today , PGA Tour players ca n't imagine playing 11 tournaments in a row , let alone winning all of them . Four , and they claim they 're " brain-dead . " <p> " Byron 's streak is something modern-day players have a tough time comprehending , " says Nick Price , who won three in a row in ' 93 . " To put together a streak like that , you have to have everything going for you . This is a record that will never be matched . " <p> Before Price , the last to win three consecutive tournaments was Tom Watson in 1980 , when he won six times and was the leading money winner for the fourth year in a row . <p> " Byron 's streak just amazes me , " Watson says . " It 's unbelievable . You wo n't see that happen again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacements , has told the story of The Streak so many times , it 's riveted in his memory . <p> He also kept a diary during his all-too-brief career from 1935-47 . It has just been published as Byron Nelson : The Little Black Book ( The Summitt Publishing Group , Arlington , Texas , $ 20 , 192 pages ) . <p> " I really do n't know why I started keeping my little black notebook . It must have had something to do with my love for figures - numbers and statistics , " Nelson says . <p> " My strict adherence to record-keeping played a major role in the great year I had in 1945 . While reviewing my records after the ' 44 season , I concluded two things : 1 ) I was n't concentrating as well as I could . 2 ) My chipping was n't as good as it needed to be . <p> " I resolved to make 1945 my best year yet . I would focus better and be more consistently accurate with my chips around the green . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Nelson did in ' 45 . The numbers are numbing to this day . He entered 30 tournaments , won 18 and was second seven times . He posted 77 rounds under 70 , and his worst finish was a tie for ninth near the end of the year . His scoring average was 68.3 ; his worst round : 75 . <p> Sure , it was during World War II , and many players were in the service , but before you cynics even think of diminishing the greatest record in sports , think about this : Sam Snead played in 26 tournaments in ' 45 and won six . <p> Ben Hogan was discharged in time to play 18 and won five . Lloyd Mangrum , Jimmy Demaret , Gene Sarazen and others were competing . <p> One major factor in Nelson 's favor was the lack of pressure from the media . The constant surveillance was n't there . There was no TV , little radio and not a lot of demands from sponsors . <p> " My one regret is that I do n't have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I do n't own any clubs from that year . <p> " I think somebody can play as well as I did , maybe better . But it would be extremely difficult to win that many because of all the outside pressure . The way things are today , I do n't think it can be broken . " <p> Somebody will shoot 55 and win the grand slam first . <p> Reflecting on ' record that will never be matched ' <p> Comparing Byron Nelson 's earnings in his PGA Tour-record 11-tournament winning streak in 1945 to what a player could amass by winning 11 in a row starting on the corresponding date , second weekend in March , of 1995 : <p> Earnings comparison Nelson 1995 $ 1,500 $ 225,000 $ 2,000 $ 216,000 $ 1,000 $ 540,000 $ 1,000 $ 216,000 $ 2,000 $ 396,000 $ 2,000 $ 234,000 $ 3,000 $ 270,000 $ 2,000 $ 252,000 $ 3,750 $ 234,000 $ 10,000 $ 234,000 $ 2,000 $ 225,000 Totals $ 30,250 $ 3,042,000 Players with the most consecutive PGA Tour victories : Byron Nelson 11 1945 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 44 , ' 45-46(1) Sam Snead 3 1945 Ben Hogan 3 1946 Bobby Locke 3 1947 Jim Ferrier 3 1951 Billy Casper 3 1960 Arnold Palmer 3 ' 60 , ' 62 Johnny Miller 3 1964 Hubert Green 3 1976 Gary Player 3 1978 Tom Watson 3 1980 Nick Price 3 1993 1 - won last event of ' 45 , first two of ' 46 <p> Fast facts on Nelson  --  Nelson won eight times in 1944 , led PGA money winners and averaged 69.67 strokes for his 85 competitive rounds . <p>  --  Nelson 's ' 45 winning streak does n't include The Masters , U.S. Open or British Open , all canceled because of World War II . <p>  --  At the ' 45 Atlanta Open , played April 5-8 on what would have been Masters weekend , Nelson shot 21-under-par 263 , a 72-hole PGA record .
