( LIGHTS FADE UP on the hotel suite . It contains a living room , a bedroom area with a large king-sized bed , and a dining area which has been turned into a makeshift office . The door to a closet is ajar revealing glimpses of women 's clothing . On the dining table is an answering machine , fax , computer , printer , copier , dozens of files , newspapers , scripts , and books . The stack of newspaper classified sections is prominent . There is a linen-draped cart with full coffee service . A whiteboard with location notes scribbled on it is propped against a wall . There is an exit to an unseen kitchenette and an exit to an unseen bathroom . Water RUNS O.S. It stops . ZELDA KELLY walks in from the bathroom . She 's well-dressed in casual clothing and attractive , but appears tired . She sits at the dining table-desk and quickly moves her things aside . She opens the papers , tosses on the floor all parts of the papers except the classifieds , and scans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) KELLY ( sotto voce ) There 's one ( circles another ad ) and another ( circles another one with surprise ) Interesting . ( looks up a number in her address book and makes a call ) Good morning , Paul . I know it 's early , but I 've been on the set since dawn . Listen . I 've changed my mind . I want to do it . Everyday in the paper here , I see at least a dozen ads like the one you showed me , so it really is n't such a far-fetched concept . It 's apple pie with a twist . I 'm still not sure if this is the answer , but there 's only one way to find out . ( a beat ) Danny had meetings in San Diego . He 's joining me today . I have n't told him yet . I 'll call you after we talk . Thanks . Bye . ( quickly calls another number ) Anna , let me speak to Mr. Kelly . ( a beat , surprised ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hmmm . Okay . No . Do n't tell him I called . Bye . ( She hangs up . The phone RINGS . She stares at it as the answering machine CLICKS on. ) p. 3 SMITH ( from the machine ) " Hello . You have reached the location office of Coup de Grace Productions ; Zelda Kelly , Producer . We are not available at this time . Please leave a message at the tone and we will return your call . You may speak as long as you like . " ( Another CLICK from the machine . Zelda studies the classifieds . ) LUCINDA 'S VOICE ( from the machine ) " Screening calls , Zelda ? Even on location ? Where the hell are you ? This is Lucinda . Let 's talk , see if you 're a creative fit for my new project . Your name keeps bubbling up . Oops , somebody more important 's on the other line . Hold on a sec . " KELLY Creative fit ? Give me a break . LUCINDA 'S VOICE ( from the machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark chuckle ) Thank god you 've got unlimited messaging . Can you come to New York week after next ? Come on . Come sweat a little . No excuses . I 'll be on location this week so ring me and my girl will forward your call . Goodbye , darling . " ( KALE SMITH bursts into the office , hearing the last of this message . Handsome and ambitious , he exudes innocence . He brings in the morning papers , a bag of food , and fresh flowers . He tries to grab the phone . Zelda tries to cover the classifieds by reorganizing the desktop . Kale wears an impeccably cut European designer 's suit. ) p. 4 SMITH Zelda ! Get it ! Get it ! I think it 's Lucinda ! ( Kale lunges for the phone , but is greeted with dead air . He hangs up the phone in chagrin . ) KELLY ( as she picks up the paper , selects the classifieds and begins perusing them ) Kale , please change the machine so it does n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mini-series . SMITH Whatever you say , Boss . ( Zelda neatly puts the paper away and begins organizing . Kale stares at her efforts and smiles ; he likes his boss . The fax machine CLICKS ON and starts emitting a facsimile transmission . She stares at the machine with disgust . He sets a place for her at her desk . ) SMITH Now sit down and have some non-caffeine , non-tannin spearmint tea . ( a smile as he checks the fax ) Gee , it 's so hard to be Californian . KELLY Especially here in Phoenix . From now on , blanket rejection on all desert stories . SMITH ( as he reads the fax ) Fax from Lucinda. ( reads it ) " Respond immediately . Need to meet with you A.S.A.P. Romantic comedy adventure feature . " KELLY She 's so pushy. p. 5 SMITH But you want to do romantic comedy , right ? Show people you can do more than make action movies ? KELLY Of course , but with Lucinda ?

I 'll have to wear it for the big event . KELLY Big event ? SMITH Our meeting with Lucinda . KELLY Meeting with Lucinda-Monster is not an event ; it 's like getting an enema. ( a beat ) Save your suit . We 'll go to New York in a couple of weeks . ( begins meticulously organizing her desk ) Did you bring the papers ? SMITH Every city you ordered . ( as she flips through papers and discards all but the classifieds ) Why 're you only reading the classifieds ? ( as he sifts through them ) And why Phoenix , Dallas , and Des Moines ? You looking for something ? p. 6 KELLY ( caught off-guard ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the country or something ? KELLY Just keeping up on current events . SMITH The classifieds tell you that ? KELLY How people buy and sell can tell you a lot . SMITH ( as he sorts out the things he brought ) Here 's the L.A. classifieds. ( starts to remove them ) KELLY No thanks . SMITH You 're not interested in how L.A. buys and sells ? KELLY Well , okay . ( She takes the offered paper , but puts it aside automatically as if uninterested . ) SMITH Zelda ? KELLY Yes . SMITH What 's so important you 'd bump Lucinda for two weeks ? KELLY I have a secret project . After we wrap up here , it 's going to require my attention for a couple of weeks . I think . SMITH I 've never heard you so unsure . Must be a risky proposition . What is it ? p. 7 KELLY A social drama . SMITH A serious film ? Wow .

You 've heard of thirty-something ? This is about forty-nothing . About an explosion in a woman 's life and her searching for all the pieces to put it back together again . SMITH Like Humpty Dumpty . KELLY Like I said , you 're KELLY too young . SMITH too young . SMITH All she needs to do is to let go . KELLY Of what ? SMITH Of all the excess baggage . KELLY Talk about obscure . Let 's get to work . How many calls left over from yesterday ? SMITH Fifteen . KELLY Jesus . p. 8 SMITH There 's also a problem on the set . We 're going to hve to reshoot the border scene . KELLY Christ . You handle it . I want to be here when Danny comes . SMITH I thought he was due in time for breakfast . KELLY Something must have come up . Tough meetings . Lots of choice property to develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( As she organizes papers , files a little too meticulously : ) SMITH ou seem nervous . Is something wrong ? KELLY Of course not .

SMITH I 'm cheaper . C'm on , Zelda . What is it ? KELLY It 's nothing . SMITH ( gives in ) Okay . ( Kale readies to leave . He looks back at her one last time . Her face is somewhat troubled . ) SMITH What is it , Chief ? ( a beat ) Danny ? p. 9 KELLY No . SMITH Okay . KELLY Yes . SMITH What ?

SMITH An accident . KELLY He 'd call . Unless he was dead . SMITH Dead then . KELLY The police would 've called . SMITH Well , if it 's any other reason , he might as well be dead , right ? KELLY We 're too civilized for that kind of reaction . p. 10 SMITH Sometimes civilized people do the most uncivilized things . Remember , my ex boiled my piranha . KELLY Class act . ( Knock at the door . ) KELLY Whoever it is , get rid of him . ( Kale answers the door and stares at the visitor ; it 's DANNY . Tall and handsome , he 's impeccably dressed in business attire tasteful , precise , upwardly mobile fare . He carries a briefcase and rolled-up architectural plans . Kale sits on the table and watches him . ) KELLY Hi , sweetheart . KELLY ( surprised , pleased ) Danny ! SMITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He kisses Zelda on the cheek . ) KELLY I 'm so glad you made it . KELLY What ? And miss a junket when my wife 's company is footing the bill ? KELLY You 're so bad , Danny . KELLY You love it . SMITH How was San Diego ? KELLY Very successful , but I did n't make it home last night . The meetings finished at eleven and I was too tired to drive back to L.A .. Car was acting up , too . p. 11 SMITH ( drily , as he sits on desk ) Having car trouble in Southern California is like a woman having a headache before sex . KELLY I thought you had an accident . SMITH Yeah , we pictured you dead . KELLY ( to Kale ) Hanging by the seat of my pants , no doubt . ( to Zelda ) Sorry , honey . KELLY That 's okay . I know the business rush . SMITH It 's only two hours from San Diego to L.A. KELLY ( a pointed , critical stare ) Yeah , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You said eleven . KELLY Kale , why do n't you run along and soak up some sunrays , without sunscreen ? ( tosses the trades at him ) Read the trades , " chill out . " KELLY Get started on reading some scripts . SMITH Yes , ma'am . KELLY And call before you drop in . SMITH ( a smile , adamant cooperation ) Uh-uh . ( Kale leaves with the scripts. ) p. 12 KELLY What a wonderful assistant . If mine tried to be as personal , you 'd stick her in the paper shredder . KELLY ( a smile ) You underestimate me . Forgive Kale ; he thinks he knew me in a past life . KELLY ( kisses her ) Do n't be upset about last night . KELLY I 'm not . KELLY I shot the breeze with Anthony and I looked up and it was one a.m . KELLY Anthony . Our dear friend . KELLY Forgive him . KELLY He still introduces you to other women . KELLY Women in real estate . KELLY Single women . KELLY Go ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KELLY There . Now you 've said it . ( a grin ) Yeah , single , young , desirous  --  and vacuous. ( quick beat ) I love you , Zelda , no matter how insecure or pretty or old or successful you are . KELLY I am not old . I 'm just not a child and Anthony dates children . p. 13 KELLY They 're over twenty-one . KELLY By a week or two . KELLY ( smiles ) No ! By at least a month ! KELLY So how 'd your meeting go ? Did you get everything you wanted ? KELLY ( a smile ) They changed the zoning , so it looks like we can push on the North County development KELLY ( gives him a kiss on the cheek ) Great . Congratulations , honey . KELLY And guess what ? KELLY ( smiling , sensing trouble ) Oh-oh . ( He takes out a file from his briefcase . It contains a photo of land . ) KELLY I found the most incredible piece of land in --  KELLY North County . KELLY KELLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new California gold . KELLY Thirty acres . All mine . When can I take you down there to see it ? KELLY You talk like you own it already . p. 14 KELLY I do . KELLY You bought it ? KELLY Yeah . KELLY What for ? KELLY Investment property ( persuasively ) unless , of course , you want to build on it . KELLY In North County ? That 's too far away . ( He shows her the file . She 's impressed , but not interested . ) KELLY Zelda , it 's something we can do together . We can build the house we 've always talked about and get out of the smog , cut some of the stress out of our lives . KELLY I ca n't live in San Diego , Danny . My work is in L.A. KELLY Just think about it , okay ? It would be a good change for us . Anyway , at this point in your career , you can live wherever you want . KELLY Not true . I have to take meetings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that stupid garden party last month , I never would 've met Lucinda . She called this morning with a proposal . ( The phone RINGS . Zelda jumps and answers it . ) KELLY Hello ? Oh , Paul . What ? Tonight 's edition ? Under the name Mrs. Wells ? No , no , it 's just that it 's happening so fast , a little too fast . Danny 's here . I 'll call you back . p. 15 KELLY Who 's Paul ? Producer ? KELLY You could say that . He gave me a great idea . KELLY What is it ? More fiction ? KELLY It 's based on a true story . KELLY Who 's the star ? KELLY It 's not a star vehicle . KELLY Period piece ? KELLY In a way . The central character 's historical in regards to the story line . KELLY Well , what happens ? What 's the synopsis ? KELLY a woman who ca n't have children . KELLY ( immediately , he 's unsettled ; he knows , but holds ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? KELLY Because she 's too mature . Anyway , she tries to adopt a baby . But her maturity makes it impossible to go the traditional routes . So she decides to acquire a baby . KELLY Acquire ? You mean purchase ? ( Danny stares at her . It makes her nervous . ) KELLY She always wanted to have a baby , but now she thinks she needs to . p. 16 KELLY Why ? KELLY She feels ( searching for the right word ) ready . For something . KELLY Uh-huh . Does the husband want it ? KELLY Maybe . She 's not sure . But he 's ready for something , too . KELLY Okay , Zelda , just give it to me straight . KELLY ( a beat , hurriedly ) She places an ad in a Phoenix newspaper to interview mothers with babies to adopt . KELLY ( somber now ) Why Phoenix ? Do n't tell me . There 's a best friend from college who lives there and she 's in on it , too . Am I getting warm ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KELLY I have n't told Elizabeth yet . We 're having lunch tomorrow . ( looks at him quietly ) KELLY I thought you 'd gotten over this . KELLY ( quietly ) I think I still want one . KELLY Zelda , you 're almost forty-five . It 's too late to raise a baby . KELLY Danny , I wake up every morning and panic . I pour myself into work , exercise like a maniac  --  anything to fill this emptiness inside . p. 17 KELLY What do you mean " emptiness " ? Our lives are busier than anybody I know . KELLY Sure , but after the work 's done , I look in the mirror and I feel like nothing 's there , like it all went up in smoke . KELLY That 's just anxiety.ZELDA Danny , you have to listen to me . Something is terribly wrong . The insomnia , the nightmares , that strange grey feeling that there 's no point in getting up in the morning . KELLY But you do get up and you look great and you seize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick beat ) Zelda , we have our privacy , a nice home , decent friends , everything you could want . KELLY Uh-huh . KELLY We stood on our heads for the fertility specialists . We tried . KELLY Yes . KELLY And then adoption did n't work out the way we wanted . Facts are facts . We move on . KELLY Right . Build a house , buy a new car . Maybe re-decorate the living room again . KELLY Okay . I know what 's really bothering you . It 's because I did n't go home last night , is n't it ? KELLY I did n't say anything . p. 18 KELLY You 're doubting me . KELLY Late meetings , car trouble . I understand . KELLY You know I love you . KELLY Then let me do this . Please . KELLY ( a sigh ) Zelda , I 'm a businessman , not a father . Teaching a son how to play baseball was just a middle class dream . KELLY Danny , you ca n't think of yourself as just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of myself as just a producer , but that 's all I am. ( a beat ) You know you 've always wanted a baby . KELLY This is n't like buying a car I do n't need  --  or getting a cat when I say I do n't want one . KELLY Ever heard of compromise ? KELLY Zelda , we have seven cats . KELLY Okay , so you 've compromised . I have , too . KELLY When ? How ? KELLY Every piece of real estate we 've owned has been chosen by you . Your babies . KELLY Well , this sounds illegal . KELLY No , it 's not . It 's private adoption . There 's a contract . And an attorney . Paul Spencer . p. 19 KELLY Ah yes . The producer with the great idea . KELLY He 's an adoption specialist . KELLY You hired him ? KELLY My doctor suggested I talk to him . I called him back after I came here and saw the ads in the paper . Look . ( grabs paper ) They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . I 've heard about them . KELLY See ? It 's not so uncommon . Paul says the money is structured as expense reimbursements to the birth mother  --  you know : maternity clothes , food , rent ; legitimate expenses . A social worker from the State monitors everything . The Southwest or Midwest are the safest places less drugs , fewer abortions . KELLY You 're never going to find a child from a newspaper ad . Christ , you ca n't even find a decent house that way . KELLY You list properties in the real estate section . KELLY Zelda , it 's a sacrifice we both have to make . That time in our lives is over . ( a beat ) I 'm not twenty-four anymore and you 're not thirty-two , if you know what I mean . KELLY ( troubled deeply by his remark , unable to bear it , cutting in ) I do n't want to talk about that . p. 20 KELLY I know . KELLY Do n't worry . I 've forgiven you . KELLY Forgiven me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our lives . I 'd just met you . I 'd just started working . A baby ? Listen to me like you could n't listen then because you were too hurt . I did n't do it because I did n't want to have your child . I could n't be a mother then . I did n't know how . KELLY ( quietly ) the baby would have been eleven this year KELLY Stop it ! We both made the decision . You were n't exactly ready to put away your briefcase for a diaper bag . I never would have gotten my first big movie if I 'd been pregnant . KELLY So now your hit movie 's raking in bucks at the video store and you want me to play daddy to somebody else 's child . No thanks . KELLY That 's it , is n't it ? It 's the " somebody else " that bugs the hell out of you  --  a nice , clean Catholic boy from Spokane . KELLY I like my liberty . You do , too  --  a consequence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two of us . KELLY Have you already forgotten the receptionist who could smell a six-figure bank account with a clothespin on her nose ? Let 's not leave her out of the equation . p. 21 KELLY She was fast food . KELLY ( angry ) You mean like a hamburger or something ? You mean the fact you had an affair with a hamburger does n't count when you 're analyzing our " monogamy " in retrospect ? How dare you call a human being " fast food " . KELLY When we finally tried to have a baby and could n't , it was n't a problem on my side . The doctors never figured out your problem because you would n't slow down long enough to manage even an immaculate conception . I was with you on the adoption stuff , right ? Even though it was n't really going to be our kid , I was with you . But I draw the line with this deal . KELLY This is n't a " deal . " ( She stares at him . She looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand with his . ) KELLY I 'm sorry that everything 's so difficult . KELLY I 'm sorry , too . KELLY What can I get you to make you happy ? I hate cats . ( sincerely , with affection ) Would you like seven more ? ( They hug . ) KELLY Come here . ( leads her to the table ) Look what I brought you . ( He unrolls the plans and shows them to her . It 's an elaborate design. ) p. 22 KELLY What is it ? KELLY A house . Could be our house . KELLY Danny . KELLY I think San Diego would be a good place for us to live . KELLY You 've spent a lot of time there lately . KELLY Zelda , do n't . KELLY ( quietly ) You have . KELLY It 's business . KELLY ( looks at him , trusting him ) Okay . KELLY ( indicates the house plan ) Just look at it . Think about it . ( They speak with passion and not anger : ) KELLY I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to . We have to deal with all of this . Do n't you see ? We do n't match anymore . We 're far apart on how we want to live our lives . KELLY Are we that far apart ? KELLY If you bring home a baby , I do n't know what will happen to us . KELLY Danny , you bought a piece of land in the middle of nowhere and designed a house for us without ever asking my advice . Does n't what I want matter anymore ? p. 23 KELLY I can sell the land tomorrow . You ca n't sell a baby . Or maybe you think you can . ( She is stunned by this statement and tries to gather her wits . She looks sad . ) KELLY If that 's what you think then you should n't be here . KELLY That sounds rather final . KELLY Just go . KELLY Back to L.A. ? KELLY ( frightened and challenged by this ) I thought you had all these old friends to visit . I thought that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you said . We 'll be both be relaxed after your picture wraps , honey , and we 'll hang out together and eat Mexican , that 's what you said . KELLY Look , do you want me to go or stay ? ( A BEEPER sounds . Both reach for their beepers , breaking the tension . ) KELLY It 's mine . ( punches in some numbers ) KELLY Who 's beeping you in Phoenix ? KELLY All my old friends . I 'm going out to buy some clothes for this godawful climate . You need anything ? KELLY Your blessing . ( a beat ) Paul put an ad in tonight 's paper . p. 24 KELLY ( not prepared for this , tries to recover ) Well , well . KELLY I did n't expect him to move so fast . Sorry . KELLY Zelda , I guarantee you , you 'll decide it 's not what you want . Go ahead , talk to these mothers , see what you 're up against . You 'll pick up your briefcase and sprint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get hurt again . ( He kisses her on the cheek and turns to leave as Kale knocks and enters . ) SMITH Excuse me . KELLY ( to Kale ) No problem . ( to Zelda ) I 'll call you later , sweetheart . ( Danny exits . ) SMITH Sorry . ( his reason as he hands her message slips ) Messages from Lucinda at the front desk . KELLY Boy , when she wants something , she puts the pedal to the metal . SMITH And now for the good news ? KELLY What ? SMITH She 's on location in the desert for the next week and a half . KELLY Desert ? What desert ? p. 25 SMITH Sonoran Desert . KELLY Gee . I was hoping it was the Sahara . Where 's the Sonoran Desert ? SMITH You 're sweating in it right now , Chief . KELLY Oh no . SMITH You mean you did n't want me to set something up ? She wants to do dinner . KELLY Why did you schedule anything without running it by me first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says she needs to close her deal A.S.A.P. And , besides , Danny did n't want me to interrupt , so I did n't feel right coming in to ask . She 's flying in tomorrow . KELLY Okay . Let 's do it . Call Allison Cornelius at Boulevard Pictures and see what you can find out about her deal on that movie she produced with Lucinda . SMITH ( takes notes ) You got it , Zelda . This is gon na be fun . KELLY Put all the information together and slip it under my door . SMITH Okay . KELLY I 've got our movie , Lucinda , and other things to worry about , so I 'm going to need you to back me up on this . p. 26 SMITH All right , Chief . KELLY What are you standing there for ? Like lightning , Kale , please . SMITH Always . ( Kale exits . Zelda gets up and locks her door . She quickly makes a call . She lights a cigarette . ) KELLY Hi Paul . I told him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . ( BLACKOUT. ) p. 27 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO ( The next day . LIGHTS FADE UP on Zelda 's suite . Sound of running WATER O.S. , a sink faucet . On the king-size bed are a magazine and Zelda 's reading glasses . There 's a pink diaper bag and a box at the end of the bed . There 's a fruit basket with lots of grapes on a table . Danny makes a half-effort at fixing the bed and prepares to leave . ) KELLY I 'll see you later , sweetheart . Be careful . KELLY ( offstage ) You be careful in the heat . Get some breakfast . ( Danny exits . The phone RINGS . Enter Zelda . In her zeal to answer , she walks across the bed . ) KELLY Hello . ( a beat ) Hello ? I 'm brushing my teeth . Can you hold on a second ? Excuse me . ( Zelda runs to the bathroom , goes in . SOUNDS of rinsing . She runs out again . ) KELLY Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Maybe you do n't have the wrong number . You 're calling about the ad --  ( Zelda stares at the phone . A hang-up . She replaces the phone . She 's irritated . An aggressive KNOCKING at the door makes her momentarily nervous . She gathers her wits . ) SMITH ( O.S. ) Zelda ! It 's me . We got a telegram . ( Kale bursts in carrying newspapers , scripts and flowers , and a bottle of water . He wears his designer casuals. ) p. 28 SMITH Hi , Chief . God , it 's hot out there . Say hello to somebody and your tongue dries up in a second . Here 's your telegram . KELLY Let me guess . From Desert Express , right ? SMITH She 's coming in any minute . She 's free for dinner ; she wants to eat " nouvelle Mexican . " KELLY ( annoyed ) Where 's she staying ? I hope it 's far away . SMITH ( looks at telegram ) According to this , she 'll be about seven floors away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the particulars , charm the pants off of her . I 'll deal with the creatives when I meet with her tomorrow . ( The phone RINGS , causing Zelda to jump . This reaction surprises Kale . ) SMITH I 'll get it for you . KELLY ( grabbing the phone ) No , that 's all right . I 'm expecting someone . ( But Kale gets the phone first because he 's closest to it . ) SMITH Hello . ( a beat ) There 's no Mrs. Wells here . ( Zelda grabs the phone . ) KELLY This is Mrs. Wells . ( surprised ) Right now ? Okay . That 's fine . Room 309 . Bye . p. 29 SMITH Mrs. Wells ? KELLY A code name . SMITH For the secret project ? KELLY Yes . Look , you have to go now . I have work to do . SMITH ( even more interested ) Well , here 's today 's papers and the new scripts . KELLY All right . Check back with me around noon . ( hands him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I can wear it tonight . ( afterthought ) Call me . No need to stop by . SMITH Sure , Chief . Stay cool . ( He exits . Zelda paces . She sets her notebook , pen and glasses on the table . A KNOCK at the door . Zelda hangs up the phone . ) KELLY Come in . ( Enter CHRISTINA . She 's nervous , thin , rough-looking , masculine in her energy . Her clothing is masculine , too , but minimal because of the heat . She wears thongs . ) CHRISTINA Mrs. Wells ? KELLY Yes . CHRISTINA Saw your ad in the paper . I just called from downstairs . KELLY Oh yes . You 're Christina. p. 30 CHRISTINA One and only . KELLY ( tentative , in control ) Have a seat , Christina . ( Zelda is about to sit , but stops when she sees that Christina is not . ) CHRISTINA I think I 'd rather stand . KELLY Okay . ( smiles at her ) Well , this is a rather uncomfortable situation . CHRISTINA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KELLY And what does that mean ? CHRISTINA Good Midwestern stock . Nothing fazes me . KELLY I see . Okay . Let 's just jump in then . ( sits and starts taking notes ) How old is your baby ? CHRISTINA He 's four months . KELLY Oh , so it 's a boy . CHRISTINA You wanted a girl ? Your ad did n't say it had to be a girl . KELLY The sex of a child does n't really matter . As long as she 's healthy . What is your so --  your little boy 's name ? CHRISTINA Are you trying to say he is n't healthy or something ? KELLY I simply asked you what his name is. p. 31 CHRISTINA No , you said it 's okay if it 's a boy if it 's healthy . My kid 's healthy . KELLY He 's up-to-date on his shots then . CHRISTINA He 's not a dog , lady . He 's a baby . KELLY I did n't mean it like that . CHRISTINA Oh , sorry . KELLY That 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Where are you from ? I see . How old is your baby ? ( a beat ) What ? I 've never thought about cremation or resurrection . ( Zelda stares at the phone again . Another hang-up . ) KELLY Strange business . CHRISTINA I do n't believe in cremation . Your soul burns up . KELLY ( smiles as she takes notes ) Rather final , is n't it ? ( Christina stares at her with curiosity . ) CHRISTINA ( blurts this out ) You sterile or something , lady ? p. 32 KELLY Never mind all that . Let 's talk about you . CHRISTINA Nothing to tell . I got knocked up , did n't have money for an abortion , so I had the baby and I do n't want it . KELLY Just like that ? CHRISTINA Just like that . KELLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather callous view ? CHRISTINA ( triggered by the remark ) Whatddya think you 're doing right now ? Buying Girl Scout cookies ? KELLY ( unfazed ) There 's nothing callous about wanting to adopt a child . ( a beat ) Why have n't you given him up for adoption before this ? CHRISTINA I just have n't . KELLY But agencies are always looking for white male babies . CHRISTINA I just have n't , okay ? ( a quick beat ) So how much ? KELLY We have to break it down into legitimate expenses . How much money have you spent on your child , including pregnancy and delivery ? CHRISTINA What ? I did n't save no receipts . KELLY I need some estimates . p. 33 CHRISTINA Fine . KELLY ( referring to the estimates ) How much have you spent , Christina ? CHRISTINA How much do you wan na offer ?

CHRISTINA Well , I produced a baby , so I guess I 'm a producer , too . Make me an offer , lady . ( Zelda sits . Christina smiles . Zelda lights up a cigarette . ) CHRISTINA Can I bum a cigarette offa you ? KELLY Sure . ( Zelda hands Christina a cigarette and , as Christina searches for a match , offers her a light . Christina is affected by this kindness. ) p. 34 CHRISTINA Gee , thanks . KELLY Do n't mention it . ( The women stare at one another . ) CHRISTINA Well ?

CHRISTINA Yeah . KELLY Yes . ( Christina gets up and walks around . She studies the room . She looks at one of Zelda 's books . ) CHRISTINA ( curtly ) All right . KELLY ( surprised ) All right ? CHRISTINA Of course . KELLY Just like that ? p. 35 CHRISTINA What 'd you expect , I 'd ask for a million or something ? It 's just a baby , lady . So important to women like you , but you 're gon na wish you never did this when he spits up on your silk shirt . KELLY I have to talk to my husband and my attorney --  CHRISTINA A lawyer ? KELLY He 'll go over the contract with you and --  CHRISTINA What 's to go over ? Just give me the paper and I 'll sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . CHRISTINA Why not ? KELLY I do n't mean to sound like I do n't trust you or anything , but , well , let 's be frank . I do n't . Why are you so eager to give up your baby ? CHRISTINA I told you . I do n't want it . KELLY And you keep calling it " it . " CHRISTINA So do you . KELLY I mean , your son . CHRISTINA Say " my son . " KELLY What ? CHRISTINA Say it and see what it feels like . Say " my son . " KELLY my son p. 36 CHRISTINA Feel good to you ? KELLY It feels strange . CHRISTINA Feels even stranger to me and I had him outta my belly . ( Christina takes another cigarette out of Zelda 's pack . She uses Zelda 's lighter and lights up . ) KELLY Let me take your information and I 'll call you later this week . CHRISTINA You mean my last name and stuff . KELLY Well , at least a number . CHRISTINA This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoops up a handful of grapes and begins eating them as she watches Christina carefully . ) KELLY May I have your number ? CHRISTINA Okay , look . Fifteen thousand . KELLY That 's not what I meant . CHRISTINA Okay . Twenty thousand . KELLY Could you bring the baby here for me to see ? CHRISTINA He 's busy today . KELLY He 's four months old . How busy can he be ? CHRISTINA You 'll see . p. 37 KELLY I 'd like to see him before I , well , you know CHRISTINA Before you buy him . KELLY Adopt him . CHRISTINA A test drive or something . KELLY Please do n't put it like that . CHRISTINA Motherhood is n't something you get to test drive . KELLY Do you have a picture of him ? ( Christina is hesitant . Finally , she reaches into her purse and pulls out her wallet . She comes up with a Polaroid picture . ) CHRISTINA Just took it yesterday . Figured you 'd ask . KELLY What a handsome child . CHRISTINA He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CHRISTINA He 's a baby , lady . KELLY What 's this mark on his cheek ? CHRISTINA A shadow . KELLY There 's no sunlight . CHRISTINA Okay , okay . It 's a birthmark . KELLY Right on his cheek ? p. 38 CHRISTINA Right on his cheek . KELLY I 've never seen one quite like that . ( Christina grabs the picture back and stuffs it into her wallet . She 's jumpy . She wants to go . ) CHRISTINA You think my kid is n't pretty enough or something for you and your husband . Lots of kids have birthmarks on their faces . He 's smart . He already says Mama . ( a beat ) Well , not really . But it sounds like it . ( strokes the picture against her shirt to clean it ) KELLY Then there 's some bonding . CHRISTINA Sorta. ( stares at his picture ) He drinks from my breasts and all , you know . KELLY ( jarred ) I see . CHRISTINA ( irritated by Zelda 's cool nature ) You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ havin ' a baby or being a mother . I got light years on your soul , lady , just ' cause I 've taken care of a tiny human being . KELLY And you want to give your baby away . CHRISTINA Damn right . I do n't have the kind of lifestyle for a kid to be runnin ' around in . ( Christina , unable to take it anymore , removes a bottle of pills from her purse and takes a couple without liquid . Zelda watches , still cool. ) p. 39 KELLY Well , that 's just great , is n't it . CHRISTINA No , but it will be . KELLY What is that ? CHRISTINA None of your business . ( laughs ) Aspirin . KELLY You 'd think you 'd have the common sense to hide it from me . Do you want someone to adopt your baby or not ? CHRISTINA ( nervous , adamant ) He deserves a chance . I mean , I do n't have a maternal bone in my body . I look at him and , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? People like you know . KELLY Know what ? CHRISTINA Believe me . I did n't do it . KELLY So it is n't a birthmark . CHRISTINA Is n't everything a mark of birth ? Every cut , every lie , every goddamned thing that happens to us from the moment we gush out of the safe ? Sure it is. ( appears vulnerable ; again , she smokes ) No more pretending , okay ? My boyfriend hit him . KELLY Is he the father ? CHRISTINA I think so . KELLY Why do n't you know ? p. 40 CHRISTINA I do n't remember getting pregnant . I just started getting fat . KELLY But did n't you miss your period ? CHRISTINA First month , no . Second month , I was too drunk to notice . KELLY Drunk ? CHRISTINA Yeah , yeah . KELLY Christina are you an addict ? CHRISTINA ( quickly ) No . KELLY I watched you take a pill . CHRISTINA Valium . I 'm sure you 're no stranger to that . I do n't do drugs like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . ( Christina just stares at her . ) KELLY Is the child addicted ? CHRISTINA He just sleeps a lot , okay ? KELLY Christ . Do n't you realize anything you put in your body gets in your breast milk ? CHRISTINA Look , lady , you ai n't Dr. Spock , so cool it . I 'm gon na level with you , okay ? ( A rapid KNOCKING at the door . Zelda hurries and opens the door . TOMMY 'S fist almost hits her in the face . He looks apologetic for his intrusion . Christina is afraid of him. ) p. 41 TOMMY Sorry , ma'am . I 've come for my girlfriend . CHRISTINA I told you not to come up here . TOMMY It 's fucking hot out there , okay . ( a beat , softer ) Excuse me , ma'am . ( turns full energy on Christina ) What 's taking you so long ? ( The women look at each other . ) TOMMY Damn it , Chrissy , you told her . CHRISTINA I did n't tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you . She always tells . You screw it up every time , Chrissy . KELLY You mean this is n't the first time you 've tried to give away your baby . CHRISTINA She figured it out . TOMMY Well , it was n't me . It was her . KELLY ( looks at the silent Christina ) What do you mean " it was her " ? TOMMY She did it . Not me . KELLY The bruise on your son 's face . TOMMY She slugs back a few shots of Stoli and her head starts spinnin ' . CHRISTINA What about the other part ? What about you pickin ' on me about my breasts bein ' hard from all this fuckin ' milk , about jumpin ' on everything I say like I 'm stupid . Yeah , I 'm stupid , all right , for bein ' with a jerk like --  p. 42 TOMMY Fuck you . You did it . CHRISTINA You did it ! KELLY Look , this is n't going very well . Perhaps we should just call this a wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kid 's okay . Honest . We just ca n't keep him . Besides , I do n't even know if it 's mine . CHRISTINA Fuck you . I never cheated on you . You 're the one sticking your --  KELLY That will be enough . TOMMY ( mocking her with physical threat ) Gee , lady , what do you like ? No sex , no bad words . That 's the problem with women like you . No wonder you ca n't have a baby . Your eggs come poppin ' out of your ovaries half-dead . KELLY ( standing up to him ) You two better leave . ( to Christina ) Give your child over to the authorities . They 'll find him a good home . CHRISTINA ( desperation ) So you do n't want him , huh ? You sure ? He 's a good boy . You could take him to a doctor and --  ( Zelda does n't get the desperation hidden in Christina 's words . ) KELLY Christina , please , no more . p. 43 CHRISTINA He 's smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mayflower , lady . Did n't they , Tommy ? They really did . KELLY I 'm sorry , but this is n't going to work out . TOMMY Come on , Chrissy . Let 's go . CHRISTINA You are n't going to report us , are you ? TOMMY Fuck her . We 'll report her . CHRISTINA He wo n't say anything . Honest . ( Tommy stares at her with agitation . A KNOCK at the door . ) KELLY ( very surprised , caught off-guard ) Jesus . TOMMY ( angry at Zelda ) Who the hell 's that ? ( to Christina ) What the fuck 's going on ? ( Another knock . ) SILVERMAN ( O.S. ) Surprise ! KELLY Uh , uh  --  just a minute ! SILVERMAN ( O.S. ; confused ) Zelda ? It 's me , Elizabeth . KELLY ( to Tommy and Christina ) You tell her you 're friends of ( grasping ) of Anthony 's . ( ELIZABETH enters . She carries a bouquet of flowers . She is an attractive Japanese American woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mars and then looks at Zelda for explanation. ) p. 44 SILVERMAN What 's going on here ? KELLY ( panicked ) Elizabeth , you said lunch . You 're early . CHRISTINA Hi . We 're friends of of Anthony 's TOMMY ( intentionally ) Anthony who ? I do n't know anybody named Anthony . SILVERMAN ( sizing up Christina ) You do n't look well . CHRISTINA I need to throw up . SILVERMAN Are you pregnant or something ? CHRISTINA ( immediate , angry reaction ) Do n't threaten me . SILVERMAN Zelda , tell me what 's going on . Tell me right now . KELLY ( to Christina ) Take your boyfriend and go . TOMMY ( to Zelda ) What about the money you owe us ? KELLY I do n't owe you any money . TOMMY Give it to me , lady . KELLY I do n't owe you anything . ( to Christina , pointedly ) You 'd better go . Right now . CHRISTINA Let 's go , Tommy . p. 45 TOMMY ( to Elizabeth as he circles her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , huh ? SILVERMAN ( pulling away , but afraid to pull away ) I beg your pardon ? ( looks at Zelda ) Selling ? KELLY You both need to leave . Now . CHRISTINA Ten thousand . KELLY Christina , please . SILVERMAN Wait a minute . What ? TOMMY Chrissy , do n't do it . CHRISTINA Five thousand . SILVERMAN I 'm calling the police . ( Elizabeth heads for the phone . He goes after her . ) TOMMY You touch that phone and you 'll be sorry . ( Tommy snatches the phone from Elizabeth and pushes her away from it . ) CHRISTINA ( to Zelda ) Two thousand , Zelda . Two . KELLY No , Christina . Do n't do this to yourself . CHRISTINA ( pleading ) Okay . Just take him . Look at him . He 's real cute , lady . KELLY I ca n't just take him . p. 46 TOMMY Chrissy , there 's plenty of women out there huntin ' for babies like their lives depend on it . CHRISTINA I ca n't hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what I 'll do . TOMMY ( ready to go ) This is like a goddamned crazy hospital fulla wailin ' women . We do n't need her . She needs us . ( And Tommy slams out of the room . Christina looks at Zelda with an uncharacteristic humanity . She holds back her tears . Again , Zelda is caught off-guard . She ca n't help being affected by this humanity . ) CHRISTINA I 'm sorry about all this . I 'm not doin ' it for my sake , really . I 'm doin ' it for the baby . KELLY ( rushed to get her out but compassionate ) Christina , take care of your son . ( Christina runs out . Elizabeth closes the door . Zelda collapses in a chair . Stunned , Elizabeth looks at her . Blackout . End of Act One. ) @x ( Lights up on hotel room . Elizabeth sits next to Zelda . She possesses a maternal air towards her friend , who tries to light a cigarette , but shakes so badly that she can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone , but I could n't . SILVERMAN I thought you let go of this after all those tests . KELLY I ca n't let go . SILVERMAN But look at the situation you got yourself into . KELLY I did n't think it would be like this . ( sad ; draws in a sharp breath ) I thought I could do this , but maybe I ca n't . SILVERMAN ( teasing her ) You 're having an anxiety attack . KELLY Definitely . SILVERMAN In college , you had one that lasted four years . ( massages Zelda 's shoulders ) Relax , Zel. ( a quick beat ) So did you place an ad ? KELLY Yes . ( hands her the ad ) Here it is . SILVERMAN Oh Zelda , you got ta be looney tunes . p. 48 KELLY I thought you 'd be happy for me . SILVERMAN I 'm scared for you . KELLY Just stand by me and be a friend , okay ? SILVERMAN Of course , but let 's go to my house , have some tea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SILVERMAN Zelda , honey , there are better ways to do this . KELLY ( desperate for understanding , without anger ) And I tried them all . Operations , diets , vitamins up the wazoo , hormone shots at $1,500 an injection . I did everything but stand on my head and let Danny screw me in mid-air . I just ca n't conceive . SILVERMAN I 'm talking about adoption agencies . Why do n't you try one ? KELLY We tried several . ( a beat ) They rejected us . SILVERMAN You did n't tell me . KELLY I was too embarrassed . SILVERMAN Why could n't you qualify ? KELLY They said I 'm too old to be a mother . ( a beat ) I 'm only forty-three . I 've exercised all my goddamned life . I 'm in better shape than a lot of women half my age . p. 49 SILVERMAN My cousin just adopted an Amerasian . You want me to call her ? There 's a lot of them stuck in the Philippines . KELLY Too much red tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chew my fingernails waiting for the government to approve immigration . With my luck , I 'd arrive in the middle of a malaria epidemic and lose my life just to find a baby . SILVERMAN Sometimes it does require that kind of sacrifice . KELLY Well , this is private adoption . SILVERMAN You can call it whatever you like , but it 's still buying and selling . KELLY Well , the law says it is n't . SILVERMAN Okay , okay . Private adoption . KELLY Thank you . SILVERMAN You 're welcome . ( a quick beat ) What was your first offer to those kids ? KELLY Twenty thousand . SILVERMAN Price of a new car . Amazing what money can buy . KELLY I know someone who paid a hundred thousand for a male baby on the black market . SILVERMAN ( reeling ) That does n't make it all right for you . That baby 's face is probably still on a milk carton while his real mother keeps looking for him . p. 50 KELLY It 's not like that . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . Why did n't you take Christina 's baby ? KELLY He 'll need lots of medical attention . SILVERMAN Cop-out . That 's what mothering 's about taking care of a sick baby , loving him anyway . ( a beat ) You 're afraid you wo n't be successful unless the baby 's perfect . KELLY ( a sigh of resignation ) I 'm not as capable as you think . SILVERMAN I thought you were desperate . KELLY I-I 'm not . SILVERMAN You 're worse than desperate . You 're desperate and choosy . That 's like saying you 're freezing and you need a coat , but only mink will do . KELLY I 've paid , Elizabeth . I 've paid all these years . You do n't know what it 's like to have your body fail you . I feel defective , barren like this goddamned desert we 're in. ( looks at her ) You have a career and a family . A million women do . SILVERMAN Zelda , you ca n't change your life with twenty minutes and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier . p. 51 KELLY Oh Elizabeth , you did everything right . You married the right man at the right time . A lawyer to boot . Two children three years apart . SILVERMAN Zelda , you laughed when I got pregnant at twenty-four . You disapproved when I decided to teach English instead of becoming a writer . Who are you kidding ? KELLY But I 'm not laughing now . I just want a second chance , Elizabeth . So what if I 'm starting late ? Do n't condemn me for that . SILVERMAN Maybe it 's not a baby you really want . Maybe it 's something else . ( a beat ) I 'm sorry . I 'm just trying to get your feet back on the ground , Zelda . ( Exhausted , Zelda sits on the bed . She opens the diaper bag and reveals beautiful baby clothes ) KELLY Look at this , Elizabeth . ( hands her a tiny pink dress ) Is n't it sweet ? SILVERMAN ( surprised , uncomfortable ) Zelda. ( looks at tag ) You bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Zelda grows sad . She opens the big box and displays a pink and white lacy hand-held bassinette with a big , fluffy pink bear in it . ) KELLY Look at this . ( She hands Elizabeth the bear and Elizabeth stares at it. ) p. 52 SILVERMAN Do n't go too far too fast , Zelda . ( She puts the bear back in the bassinette . The phone RINGS . Zelda jumps . She answers it . ) KELLY Hello . ( a beat ) Thank you for calling . ( a beat , encouraged ) What ? Yes , I 'm a good Christian . I do n't have any other children . ( a beat ) I think my husband believes in God . I 've never asked him . ( a quick beat , as if to make a case ) He was raised Catholic . ( a beat ) Uh , I 'm thirty-five .

SILVERMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zelda takes it and drains it . ) KELLY I never imagined myself in a situation like this . SILVERMAN Where 's Danny ? KELLY Out somewhere . SILVERMAN What 's he have to say about this ? KELLY We 're not sure . SILVERMAN Well , that 's a real ' 90s answer . p. 53 KELLY It 's an honest answer . He does n't want either of us to be hurt . He thinks this is a knee-jerk reaction to stress . But it isn't. ( a beat ) Elizabeth , I just feel lonely . SILVERMAN Everybody gets lonely . Everybody wakes up in the middle of being middle-aged and wonders why their lives feel so empty . You 're not going to fix it by adding something on the outside . You have to go inside , fix something there . KELLY I do n't know what to fix . I do n't know what 's broken . SILVERMAN And do you really believe a baby is the answer ? KELLY Well , if I knew , I 'd be sitting on the right hand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I need to take care of someone else besides myself . ( reaches out for Elizabeth ) At least give me your moral support . SILVERMAN ( compassionate , but turning away ) I just do n't believe in what you 're doing . KELLY Gee , I 'm looking forward to lunch . ( And Kale enters whistling a happy tune . He carries bottled water . He stops short at the sight of the two women . His eyes scan the baby clothes and bassinette . ) SMITH Hello . p. 54 KELLY ( trying to gather her wits ) Whatever happened to knocking before entering ? SMITH I 'm Kale Smith , Zelda 's assistant . SILVERMAN Hello . I 'm Elizabeth Silverman . SMITH The college roommate . Nice to meet you . KELLY Kale , I told you to check in with me at noon . SMITH It 's eleven fifty-nine . KELLY I told you to call . SMITH That 's right . I 'm sorry . I forgot . ( looks back and forth at the women ) I thought you were working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Kale picks up an item of baby clothing . Zelda takes it and puts away the baby clothes . ) SMITH Who 's having a baby ? KELLY A friend . SMITH ( to Elizabeth ) You ? SILVERMAN I had mine a long time ago . Two teenagers . SMITH You do n't look old enough to have kids that age . SILVERMAN ( to Zelda ) Full of L.A. charm , is n't he . p. 55 KELLY Kale , why do n't you call me from your room in about an hour ? Did you finish your reading ? SMITH I read two scripts already . My eyes feel like dried slugs . I need a break . ( a beat ) So , tell me , does Elizabeth know about the secret project ? Is it some juicy story extracted right out of her life ? KELLY No , Kale . SMITH C'm on . It 's all over your faces . Why ca n't you tell me ? KELLY ( lights a cigarette and smokes ) I 'm researching women who adopt babies through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My girlfriend knows a woman who bought a Romanian baby for a hundred and eighty dollars . Price-per-ounce or something . ( laughs ) But she spent one helluva crazy month in the underworld to find the kid . KELLY ( quickly ) Well , this is n't really about buying and selling . The women adopt unwanted babies and cover the birth mother 's expenses . SMITH Zelda , you know me . Films with social bite . I can really sink my teeth into this one . ( Zelda hands him the ad as Elizabeth cuts her a disapproving glance . ) KELLY Here . Start with this . p. 56 SMITH " Financially secure couple seeks infant for private adoption into good home . In Phoenix until August 3 . Hotel Rosalinda . Suite 309. 798-1100 . Mrs. Wells . " Wow . So it is baby-buying . Old men with young sterile wives . Do you guys actually know the chick who did this ? KELLY ( a long beat as she and Elizabeth stare at each other and Kale looks on eagerly ) I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with confusion ) What ? KELLY Think of it as research , Kale . SMITH Then why did n't you ask me to handle it for you ? KELLY Because it 's my life . SMITH Wait a minute . So is it for a film or is n't it ? SILVERMAN Certainly could be . You movie people lead such strange lives . SMITH ( recalls and the light bulb goes on ) Mrs. Wells ! Code name , secret project . Wow , Zelda. ( new excitement ) You know I could really help you on this . KELLY Kale , you 're a sweetheart to want to help . Thanks . SMITH No , I mean even if it does n't work out for you personally , it 'd still make a great movie . p. 57 KELLY Just get back to work . This is not the movies ; it 's reality . SMITH ( realizing his faux pas ) Oh yeah , yeah . I 'm sorry . I 've got the grace of a gorilla . KELLY Okay . SMITH I 'll check in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set today ? KELLY We 'll see . Did you call Lucinda ? SMITH Yeah . We 're going to have drinks after lunch . I 'll call after I give her the once-over . See ya . ( Kale leaves . The phone RINGS and Zelda jumps . ) KELLY Jesus . SILVERMAN You 're on . ( Elizabeth picks up the receiver and hands it to her . As Zelda talks , Elizabeth puts the flowers into a vase . ) KELLY Hello ? ( a beat , relieved ) Oh , hi Lucinda. ( a beat , fake sincerity ) Oh my god , you got dust in your hair in the desert ! It does stick to styling mousse , does n't it ? ( clucks her tongue twice as if to say " tsk , tsk " ) Okay , I 'll make time . Dinner for fun . I 've heard of that . ( a beat ) Of course we 're a creative fit . Tootaloo . Ca n't wait to see you , darling . ( Zelda hangs up. ) p. 58 SILVERMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big producer ; I 'm a little producer who needs her power to get more power .

( a beat ) Yes . This is Mrs. Wells . Thank you for properly responding to my ad. ( a beat ) Now ? What a fast business . ( looks apologetically at Elizabeth ) Come on over . ( a beat ) What 's your name ? ( a beat ) Janine . Oh , by the way , I just wanted to ask what do you do for a living ? ( a beat , relieved ) A law student ? How nice . All right . See you soon . ( happy , she hangs up the phone ) A year from now , we 'll meet at a nice restaurant and I 'll be the one saying I told you so . SILVERMAN Maybe so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in defense ) I met you at the park once with your kids . SILVERMAN And you took them to Disneyland . KELLY Twice ! p. 59 SILVERMAN But you were too busy to return their phone calls when he lost his first tooth , when she had her first date KELLY I 'm sorry . Things just get so hectic sometimes . SILVERMAN All the time with you , Zelda . You 'll be busy until the day you die . On your way to Heaven , you 'll want to stop and make a phone call . KELLY I must be doing something right ; you 're predicting Heaven . SILVERMAN You call me if you need anything . KELLY ( disappointed ) Okay . Will I see you before I leave ? SILVERMAN Uh , yes . Sure . Call me ? KELLY Of course . ( Elizabeth exits . Zelda unrolls the architectural plans and studies them . She feels uneasy . Lights crossfade to Scene Two. ) p. 60 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO ( Lights fade up on hotel room . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She makes a call . ) KELLY Hello . This is 309 . Is my dry cleaning ready ? I need it no later than five . ( A KNOCK at the door . ) KELLY ( into phone ) Forget it . I think it 's here now . ( She goes towards the door . The phone RINGS . She stops to catch it . ) KELLY ( into phone ) Hello , Paul . ( Another KNOCK . ) KELLY ( to door ) Come in. ( continuing into phone ) I 've only interviewed one woman and she was n't right . ( Enter Janine . She steps hesitantly into the room . She 's a beautiful multiracial Sicilian-African American woman , golden brown and exuding intelligence . There 's an undercurrent of nervousness that she manages to control most of the time . She stares at Zelda 's back . She wears a suit and carries a briefcase . Her appearance is neat . Zelda continues talking into the phone and does n't see her . She takes a couple of dollar bills out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bills to her . ) KELLY ( to Janine ) Here 's a tip . Just leave it on the table . ( into phone ) Can I call you back , Paul ? Thanks . Goodbye . ( Zelda turns to encounter Janine and , in her surprise , leaves the phone off the hook . She does n't notice this . She stares at Janine. ) p. 61 KELLY Do you have the wrong room ? I was expecting someone from housekeeping . JANINE I 'm not good at talking to strangers ; let me introduce myself . I 'm Janine . You must be Mrs. Wells . Pleasure to meet you . ( Janine extends a hand to shake . Zelda tries to cover her surprise and shakes Janine 's hand . ) KELLY Why , yes . Hello . Pleasure . The law student , right ? JANINE Yes . Stanford . But I grew up in Phoenix . KELLY I see . Uh , sit down , Janine . ( Janine motions for Zelda to sit . She does . ) JANINE ( indicates coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Janine pours Zelda a cup of coffee and sits . ) KELLY It might be cold . JANINE Warm enough . How do you take it ? KELLY Black . ( a beat ) Sorry . JANINE For what ? KELLY Well , I said I take it black . I did n't want you to be black . p. 62 JANINE I 'm not . I 'm half Sicilian and half African American . KELLY I beg your pardon ? JANINE I 'm multiracial . KELLY ( softly , not understanding ) But you 're still black . JANINE No . I 'm two things . It 's like mixing red and blue , Mrs. Wells . You get violet . A new color with a new name . KELLY Multiracial. ( a beat ) All right . JANINE Are you sure it 's all right ? KELLY Of course . ( a beat , making it up as she goes along ) I mean , you 're the kind of mother I pictured when I placed the ad . JANINE Except for my tan . KELLY Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing to make it up , reaching ) Y-you have so much going for you . You 're bright , mature , ambitious JANINE Okay . Then should we get down to business ? KELLY I guess so . Let 's do it . JANINE ( begins taking notes ) All right . Do you have an attorney ? p. 63 KELLY He 's available for phone consultation . JANINE Good . And there 's a social worker ? KELLY Of course . ( a beat ) Janine , why did n't you bring your baby with you ? JANINE ( a smile ) I did . KELLY ( confused ) What do you mean ? JANINE I 'm pregnant . KELLY Goodness . Sorry . I did n't expect this . How far along are you ? JANINE Four and a half months . It 's just my luck that I 'll be showing in my last semester at school , but that 's okay . I have to get my act together by January . I have an internship in L.A. KELLY Let me guess once you get settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JANINE No , first I 'll spend about ten years establishing myself . KELLY Uh-huh . That will make you about thirty-five . JANINE I only want one child , so I do n't mind getting a late start . I just have to be realistic . What kind of mother could I be to my baby now without time or money . KELLY I understand . ( a beat , as she absorbs the similarities ) I did it exactly the way you did , but , when the time was right , my body did n't want to make babies anymore . p. 64 JANINE ( surprised ) Did you know you were barren ? KELLY I was n't infertile . I just could n't get pregnant . I tried for three years . And , uh , well . ( deciding to tell her ) Well , why not . When I was thirty-two , I got pregnant once . JANINE Did you give the baby up for adoption ? KELLY No . JANINE I see . KELLY Why did n't you , I mean , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half months . KELLY Does your husband know you 're here ? JANINE ( uncomfortable pause ) There 's no husband , no father . KELLY Well , unless things have changed that I 'm not aware of , there has to be a father . JANINE Look , we split up last week , okay ? KELLY ( realizing it 's touchy ground ) Okay . I 'm sorry . But , if that 's the case , then I do n't understand why you 're keeping the baby . JANINE I already love the baby . KELLY ( softly ) And you love him . The father . p. 65 JANINE Do you really want to hear about the lifestyles of nice supergirls who do too much ? I mean , does it matter if I loved him ? KELLY Well , no . I guess not . Not to me . JANINE ( vulnerable , fighting it ) I just ca n't rear her on my own . KELLY What about your parents ? Ca n't they help you ? ( As Janine speaks , Zelda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're dead . KELLY Which parent was Sicilian ? JANINE My mother . I was reared by my father 's family . They wanted me to forget that I 'm half Sicilian . But I wo n't . I should n't be expected to disrespect my mother , or pass for black no more than I should pass for white . ( a beat ) That 's why I want my baby to be raised understanding no one can stick her into a category just to make their lives easier . KELLY I 'm not sure if I know what you mean . JANINE She 'll be violet . KELLY I see . JANINE ( with somber significance ) I 'm asking if you can raise a multiracial child . ( A KNOCK . They both freeze. ) p. 66 JANINE Who is that ? KELLY Probably my assistant . ( Zelda opens the door . It 's Elizabeth . ) KELLY Elizabeth . Why did you come back ? SILVERMAN I do n't know . Jewish guilt . I told you to be a good mother , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want that moral support ? ( as she notices Janine ) Looks like I 'm getting real good at crashing your interviews . ( to Janine ) Hello . I 'm Elizabeth Silverman . JANINE Hello . I 'm Janine . SILVERMAN Oh , the law student . Zelda was really looking forward to meeting you . JANINE ( uncomfortable , to Zelda ) It 's not appropriate for her to be here . KELLY Elizabeth is like family . She 's completely informed about what I 'm doing . JANINE I do n't want to discuss our business in the presence of a stranger . SILVERMAN Why do n't I just call you later , Zel ? JANINE No . That 's all right . I 'll go . I think my baby is n't your cup of tea anyway , Mrs. Wells . KELLY Do n't be absurd . That 's not it . p. 67 JANINE What is it then ? SILVERMAN What are you talking about ? JANINE Color . SILVERMAN That does n't matter to Zelda . As long as you do n't drink or use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zelda 's face . ) SILVERMAN Zelda , tell her it does n't matter . KELLY ( very uncomfortable ) I think I 'm having another anxiety attack . JANINE I 'd better leave before I have one , too . KELLY I 'm sorry . No offense. ( a beat , embarrassed , difficult to say , discovering it as she speaks ) I 'm just not sure if I know how to raise a baby who is n't white . SILVERMAN What ? Could you run that by me again please ? KELLY ( to Elizabeth , indicating Janine ) I mean her . SILVERMAN It includes me , too . KELLY You 're not multiracial . SILVERMAN My children are Japanese and Jewish , thank you very much . KELLY Okay . Chill out , Elizabeth . ( to Janine ) I mean , I marched in the civil rights movement ; and I know it sounds stupid , but I have friends of all colors . I even dated a black man in college . p. 68 JANINE ( a wrv smile ) Really ? I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to be white to be acceptable . I 'm just saying I know my limitations . How can I teach a baby how to be Asian or multiracial or whatever ? SILVERMAN You teach a child how to be a good human being . KELLY ( impassioned ; looks at Janine ) What happens when she comes home one day and says , " Mom , the kids at school called me a half-breed " and I have to go fight a battle that I 'm not equipped to fight ? JANINE There 's no instruction sheet . You make her believe she 's special and loved . KELLY ( more than she can handle ) I just do n't know if I 'm ready for this . JANINE If you 're ready for a baby , you 're ready for anything . KELLY It 's just that there are so many issues , problems . JANINE Excuse me , but they 're only issues to white people . It 's real life to me . I make no apologies for me or my baby . I consider being multiracial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so new . JANINE It 's reality . p. 69 SILVERMAN That 's right . Interracial marriage is nothing new and , I got news for you , mixed marriages create mixed children . KELLY ( the words coming out before she realizes what she has said ) What did the father look like ? JANINE Irish . KELLY I wonder what she 'll look like . SILVERMAN Zelda . JANINE ( suddenly terse ) You 're wondering how white she 'll be . KELLY That 's not what I meant . ( she 's not sure ) I 'm sure that 's not what I meant . JANINE I think it is . I thought your ad did n't specify race because it did n't matter . KELLY I thought it did n't . JANINE I guess intelligence and ambition are n't as marketable as you led me to believe . ( as she moves towards the door ) Nice meeting you , Mrs. Wells . ( Zelda immediately grabs her by the arm to stop her . Janine yanks her arm away and holds her ground . ) KELLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important about our meeting . You have to raise her . When you look back on this time in your life , you 'll realize it was possible . p. 70 JANINE My baby deserves a chance for a full life . KELLY But do n't you see ? All you 're doing is giving you a chance for your life . JANINE Go to hell . KELLY I know because I took the very same chance . I caved into my fears . ( imploring ) We 're so much alike . You can learn from my mistakes . JANINE There 's nothing alike about us , Mrs. Wells . You 're white , married , and wealthy . I 'm multiracial , unmarried and working two jobs just to get by . ( a beat ) This meeting is over . ( Flustered and angry , Janine heads towards the door . Zelda grabs her arm gently . ) KELLY Janine . Just think about what I 've said . For your baby 's sake . JANINE ( pulls her arm away ; steely ) And my name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exits . Elizabeth stares at Zelda like she 's a stranger . ) SILVERMAN Throw in the towel , Zelda . I ca n't believe you asked her about the father . KELLY I was trying to be honest , okay ? I mean , I just had it in my head that I would find a baby who looked like Danny and me. p. 71 SILVERMAN Uh-huh . Tell me , Zelda , you still have cats ? KELLY Of course . SILVERMAN Are all of them white ? KELLY Well they 're Siamese . SILVERMAN Asian cats ? Goodness . How generous of you . KELLY Are there Caucasian cats ? SILVERMAN Yes . ( a beat ) American domestic alley cats . KELLY Now there 's food for thought . Sturdy but dirty . SILVERMAN You said it . ( a beat ) If something ever happened to Jonathan and me , I would have left my children in your hands . Zelda , I believed you were better than all the rest . I believed you could have reared my children . But you ca n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm racist ? SILVERMAN ( quietly ) You 're either a racist or a coward . You choose . KELLY ( troubled , realizing ) Oh , Elizabeth , I 'm sorry . I screwed up . SILVERMAN Do n't tell me . Run down the hallway and tell Janine. p. 72 KELLY I 'm so confused . ( a beat ) Can you forgive me ? SILVERMAN Zelda , I need to go home , hug my kids , maybe have another one or something . KELLY She was perfect , was n't she ? SILVERMAN Maybe not , but she had a hell of a lot going for her and you might have just been able to make this crazy idea work . I have to go . KELLY In college , when Mike broke up with me , he said , " Zelda , you 're going to grow up to be one of those white chicks to the left of center who does n't want her kids to marry blacks . " SILVERMAN Was he right ? KELLY I ca n't let him be right . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheaths of documents . Elizabeth musters a smile . He kisses Elizabeth on the cheek . ) KELLY Hello Elizabeth . SILVERMAN Hi Danny . KELLY You been sitting in on these ? SILVERMAN You could say that . ( a beat ) Take care , Zelda . KELLY Elizabeth , please . SILVERMAN Call me when you have some answers . Good luck . ( stops at door ) Here 's my family doctor 's card Call her , have the baby examined , okay ? For your own peace of mind . p. 73 KELLY Thank you . ( She exits . Danny puts down the folder . Zelda 's eyes rest on it for a second . ) KELLY There was a Hispanic woman at the elevator . Was she one of the candidates ? KELLY Yes . Janine . And the word is Latina . KELLY Okay . Interesting . Did it surprise you that she was " Latina " ? KELLY She 's not . She 's Euro-African violet . KELLY What ? KELLY Stick around . You might learn a few things . KELLY Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm prepared for anything . KELLY ( not believing her ) Well , well . The grand deal-maker is having a pretty rough time today . KELLY What do you know about today ? KELLY I told you it was n't going to be easy . I told you it would hurt . KELLY Just get out of here , Danny . Go buy the Grand Canyon . KELLY You know what you ought to do ? Call back Janet or whatever her name was and take that baby . You waltz around L.A. as the queen of liberal politics and then you wo n't bring a baby into your home because it 's color is n't right . This is n't interior decorating , darling . You 're doing something good for humankind . You 're saving a child from foster homes and poverty or something like that . What did you expect , that someone was going to hand you Prince William on a silver platter ? p. 74 KELLY So I 'm not the humanitarian I thought I was . I 'm a faux liberal . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.A. , platinum American Express cards clenched in our bejeweled fists . Excuse me , white bejeweled fists . KELLY Then you concede this thing . KELLY Oh yes . KELLY Good . KELLY Yes , I 'm going to call Janine and adopt the baby . The baby to be . Its father was white , so it 's three-quarters white . That 's good enough for Spokane , is n't it ? KELLY I was joking , Zelda . We ca n't raise a black child . KELLY She wo n't be black . She 'll be multiracial . A kid of the future . First on the block . KELLY What are you going to tell her when she grows up ? ( mimics Zelda talking to an imaginary daughter ) " Good morning , Tammy . Nanny will get your breakfast for you . In case you 're wondering , I got you through the classifieds . You were a bargain , honey . I paid cash and I have the contract to prove it . " KELLY Stop it ! I will tell her that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetheart . You 're way over the speed limit . p. 75 KELLY You hit the brakes . KELLY Zelda , you ca n't win this one . KELLY It 's not a contest , Danny . It 's about our future , all of it . KELLY And you get to decide it ? KELLY We both do . We both have a say . KELLY And when we disagree , who 's the tie breaker ? KELLY I - I do n't know . KELLY What do you want me to do ? KELLY I want you to stay . Here . In this room . KELLY I , uh , have a meeting . KELLY What do you mean ? KELLY A little meeting . With my friend Jeff , check out real estate . KELLY Wait a minute . You mean you 're doing business today ? KELLY Well KELLY Let 's see . In repressed Catholic-ese , that means , " Yes , but I do n't want to tell you because deceit is less stressful . " You said you came here for us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone , in the taxi , in the john ; those are our goddamned symptoms , right ? p. 76 KELLY But I 'm here on location . You made me believe that you jumped on a plane and flew to Phoenix just for us . I guess the trip was n't worth it unless you could write it off . KELLY Look , I did n't plan to do business . It just happened . Jeff had a little something to show me . KELLY You came for another piece of real estate to sell to god-knows-what --  KELLY A million dollar piece of real  --  KELLY Shut up ! You came for dirt and not for me ! Next you 'll be telling me you found an incredible house in the desert that guarantees peace of mind . Who 's peace of mind ? Yours ? As long as you 're happy , I 'm supposed to trot along , make movies , and retire to the goddamn suburbs wondering what happened to the pursuit of happiness ? ( In anger , Zelda rips the architectural plan into pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what the hell are you doing ? Pull yourself together . KELLY It 's just real estate . Fake estate . KELLY Pick it up , Zelda. ( she starts to crumble ) I said pick it ( advances towards her as if he might hit her , realizes and drops his arm ) up ( He tries to gather his wits . She starts to pick up the pieces of the plan , but sits on the floor beside them and fights the need to cry . He tries to help her up . She refuses the help , gathers all the papers , scrambles up , and hands them to him . She sits on the bed . He puts the fragments of the plan on the table . They stare at each other. ) p. 77 KELLY You 're right about the emptiness . I feel something , too . I do n't know what the hell it is , but I feel it . When I wake up and my wife 's shopping for a baby and I 'm at best ambivalent , then I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , you can deal with land because you can touch it . What 's wrong with us is n't that easy to put your finger on . ( a beat ) Stay here and be with me for the next one . KELLY And what would I do ? KELLY You could hold the baby . KELLY I 'm not ready . KELLY That 's what I 'm afraid of , Danny . ( a beat ) My mother said the best thing she ever did in her life was to have me . She said I was a gift for her old age . ( They look at each other uncomfortably . He goes into the bathroom offstage . Sounds of running water are heard . Zelda tries to gather her wits . She reaches for the phone . She realizes that it 's been off the hook and gasps . ) KELLY My god , the damn thing 's been off the hook ! ( Frantic , she poises to dial a number , but does not . Suddenly , she drops the phone . She picks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tailspin , she hangs up the phone. ) p. 78 KELLY Oh , Zelda . You 're such a good dealer . Sure , that 's what everybody says . I really know how to make a deal . I do n't even have Janine 's number . I do n't even know her real name . ( A KNOCK at the door . She 's nervous , disoriented . ) KELLY Come in . Janine , is that you ? Come in . Come --  ( Zelda stops in mid-sentence in awe at the sight of MARY as she enters . She is a plain , simple creature . A baby pouch is slung across her chest . Mary is overwhelmed by the room . Zelda stares at Mary and the baby with a strange sense of hunger . ) BAKER Wow . Never seen anything like this . KELLY How do you do ? You 're ? BAKER Mary Baker , ma'am . How do you do ? KELLY Just fine . ( Danny emerges from the bathroom . He is surprised to see Mary and is awestruck by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary 's baby . ) KELLY Hello . BAKER Mary Baker , sir . Nice to meet you . KELLY My pleasure . KELLY Are you staying ? BAKER I 'd like to , ma'am . I think . p. 79 KELLY No , I mean him . Are you staying , Danny ? BAKER This your husband , ma'am ? KELLY That I am . The man of the house . The negotiator . Are you answering our ad ? BAKER Yes sir . I called a coupla times . It was busy . I left a message I 'd be by around one . Wanted to see you today before I lost my nerve . I hope you do n't mind I brung my baby . It 's her nap time . She sleeps good . Babysittin ' cost a lotta money . KELLY It 's fine , really . BAKER I left my other baby with a friend , but she ca n't watch two . Well , she 's not really a baby . She 's three now . KELLY You have two children ? BAKER ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you manage ? BAKER I do n't . Guess that 's why I 'm here . My friend saw your thing in the paper . Told me about it . KELLY How old are you , Mary ? KELLY Danny , that 's none of our business . BAKER That 's okay . Uh ( contemplating whether or not to tell the truth ) eighteen . Not really . I 'm seventeen . p. 80 KELLY You 're quite young to be a mother . BAKER I was fourteen when I had the other one . There 's nothing to having one , ma'am . Shoot , anybody can do that . KELLY Yes . I suppose . ( a beat , indicating the sleeping baby ) What 's her name ? BAKER Billie Jo . KELLY Billie Jo ? BAKER Yeah . I always liked that name . It was my granny 's . KELLY It 's very nice . BAKER Yeah . KELLY Simple . BAKER Yeah . Easy name . KELLY Zelda loves " Jo " names . Bobbie Jo , Sally Jo . If we got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BAKER James Joseph . That 's a good name . KELLY ( momentarily humbled by her simplicity ) I I guess it is . KELLY How old is Billie Jo ? BAKER She 's three months . ( Zelda peeks in the pouch and smiles . ) KELLY What beautiful blonde hair . p. 81 BAKER Pretty , huh ? KELLY Perfect . Just what the advertising manager ordered . KELLY Please have a seat , Mary . ( Mary sits . ) KELLY So , you want to give up your baby for adoption . BAKER ( humbly ) Have to . No other choice . KELLY There 's always another choice . KELLY ( a warning ) Danny . ( to Mary ) You need money . BAKER Yeah . Pretty bad . We 're staying with my friend . But he 's tired of us . I can tell . Got ta move on soon . ( Mary almost cries . Zelda feels sorry for her . She gives her a glass of water . Mary gulps it down . The tears quiet Danny . He bows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Promise I wo n't cry no more . KELLY Mary , where is your husband ? BAKER I ai n't married , ma'am . KELLY All right . BAKER Nobody never asked , ma'am . KELLY I see . Where is the children 's father ? p. 82 BAKER He went lookin ' for work and I have n't heard from him since . I think he went back to Tulsa . That 's where we 're from . KELLY Do you think he 'll come back ? BAKER No , ma'am . I worked that stuff out real calm-like in my head . No . KELLY What about your other child ? Will you keep her ? BAKER Well , we 're real close . Figure I really can only take care of one of them . Figure it 's best I let go of Billie Jo before I love her too much , you know ? KELLY Is it easier to let go of her because you have another one ? I used to have fourteen cats . My husband made me give half of them away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zelda . BAKER ( shocked ) Cats ? Havin ' a cat ai n't nothin ' like havin ' children . Geez , my kids came outta my body , my own flesh and blood . ( Mary strokes the baby 's hair . ) KELLY ( surprised at the anger ) Sorry . I did n't mean it like that . My cats have become too important to me. ( a beat ) Are you really going to be able to make it after Billie Jo is gone ? BAKER I do n't know . p. 83 KELLY One less mouth to feed is n't a fortune . BAKER It is when you ai n't got nothin ' . ( Zelda paces the room . She stops and stares at Danny who stares back blankly . ) KELLY ( to Danny ) Well ? KELLY Play ball , Zelda . It 's your game . KELLY All right then . ( to Mary ) How much money do you need ? BAKER ( nervous ) A lot . I got ta get back on my feet . I got ta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a lot of money to you , Mary ? KELLY Good pitch , Zelda . BAKER Boy , this is harder than I thought it would be . Just like that , huh ? You just ask me " how much " and you pay me and I walk outta here ? KELLY It 's a little more complicated than that . KELLY Just a little . BAKER Excuse me , sir . I hope you do n't mind me sayin ' , but the way you keep kinda buttin ' in , sayin ' little things ? Makes me nervous . I think you 're making your wife nervous , too . KELLY Are you nervous , Zelda ? p. 84 KELLY Every bone in my body is cracking . KELLY ( to Mary ) She 's nervous . Sorry . We had a fight today . KELLY A conflict . BAKER ( genuinely sorry , aside to Zelda ) He did n't beat you or nothin ' , did he ? KELLY Did I abuse you Zelda ? Abuse your trust , your distrust ? KELLY No. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't understand ) Man , you rich people are really weird sometimes . KELLY ( gently ) So how much , Mary ? BAKER Well , uh . Well . Five thousand dollars . KELLY Five thousand dollars ? BAKER Well , okay , four then . KELLY Goodness . KELLY Well , after all , we 're in a recession . BAKER Look , I do n't know too much about these kinda things , but I ai n't gon na let you finagle me down to nothin ' . I know you got at least four thousand . I mean , look at this hotel room and all . I talked to a girl and she told me she got five thousand . p. 85 KELLY Is the baby healthy ? BAKER Yeah , sure she 's healthy . ( The baby WHIMPERS . Mary sits and begins breastfeeding the child . We see her place her breast , but the activity is concealed under a blanket . Still , Zelda is totally unnerved . Danny looks away . ) KELLY Does that hurt ? BAKER Feels good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like electricity 's movin ' up your body , all the way from your toes to your head . KELLY It sounds rather sensual . BAKER Yeah . I guess you could call it that . Hope it do n't embarrass you or nothin ' , sir . KELLY Do n't mind me . I 'm just waiting for the ninth inning . ( Mary closes her eyes and enjoys the moment . She looks down at the baby and puts her breast back in her shirt . Zelda is envious . ) KELLY What 's wrong ? BAKER ( finds the question idiotic ) She 's sleepin ' . KELLY Oh . ( a beat ) Is she a smart baby ? BAKER I guess . Hard to tell when they 're little . What 's the difference anyway ? I 'm smart , but it do n't do me much good ' cause I never finished school . I want Billie Jo to go to school . Not just any school , but a good one . I want her to go to college and all and live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those fairy tales or something . Can you give her that stuff ? p. 86 KELLY Can we , Danny ? KELLY In theory yes . BAKER Okay , but here 's the hard part . You got ta promise you 're gon na always love her like she was your own ; that you ai n't gon na make her feel bad because she was bought and all . KELLY Adopted . BAKER Yeah . You promise ? KELLY Yes . BAKER And you , sir ? KELLY Leave me out of this , okay ? BAKER Well , sir , I can't. ( shows him the baby ) See , sir ? She 's gon na look at you every day of her life the rest of her life and call you " Daddy . " You promise ? KELLY ( softly , confused ) Okay , okay . ( His response surprises Zelda . ) BAKER Okay . Good . ( hard for her ) So I just give her to you and that 's it , right ? I , uh , never see her again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing elaborate . He 'll go over the contract with you and  --  BAKER You never said I had to sign nothin ' . What for ? I do n't want any trouble , ma'am . p. 87 KELLY It 's just in case you wake up some Sunday a few months from now and decide you want her back . BAKER Well , that 's easy . Of course I would . I mean , she 's my baby and all . KELLY But , you see , Mary , this is a business deal . You give her away and it 's done . You ca n't undo it . KELLY That 's not what she means , Zelda . BAKER Right . I wo n't bother you or nothin ' . But I 'm gon na wake up every day wishing I had her . I wish I had money like you so I could have both my girls . But I 'm just not lucky like you . KELLY You 're young . I guess you can have another child at some point . BAKER ( sadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbit . ( They all look at each other quietly . ) BAKER What 's a lady like you doing buyin ' a baby , if you do n't mind me askin ' , ' specially when your husband seems kinda put-out about it . KELLY We need a baby in our lives . BAKER Do n't take this wrong , ma'am , but you do n't need one . KELLY You ca n't speak for my need . BAKER I need one . Mine . Need 's for mamas and babies . You 're standing on the outside lookin ' in . That 's not need . That's --  p. 88 KELLY Five thousand is acceptable . But I want Billie Jo to get a physical first . I 'll pay for it . BAKER ( sadly ) Okay . KELLY We 'll schedule it right away . With a local physician . KELLY Just do it , Mary . BAKER Okay . KELLY I 'd like her to check you , too . BAKER Me ? There 's nothin ' wrong with --  KELLY Please , Mary . I need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . KELLY You 're not in a position to criticize me . BAKER I 'm Billie Jo 's mother . If I 'm gon na put her in your hands for the rest of her life , I can say whatever I need to say . KELLY I 'm sorry . Really . I got carried away . BAKER Okay . I 'm sorry . Must be hard on you , too . I 'll get a check-up . Whatever 'll make this right . KELLY Give me the baby . I want to hold her . BAKER ( stammering ) Uh uh KELLY Please let me hold her . ( Mary looks uncertain . The women stare at each other . Reluctantly , Mary nods . Zelda reaches out for the baby , but , at the last moment , Mary pulls away. ) p. 89 BAKER Better not . KELLY Why not ? BAKER You 'll wake her up . Never wake a sleepin ' baby . KELLY Are you trying to hide something from me ? BAKER What 're you talkin ' about ? KELLY Has she been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? Do I look like someone who 'd beat her child ? KELLY She asked because you asked if I beat my wife . BAKER Well , it 's crazy . KELLY Well , you brought it up . KELLY Why ca n't I hold her ? If I 'm adopting her , then I should be able to hold her before I make up my mind . BAKER Do n't talk about her like that . KELLY Let me hold her . BAKER No . KELLY Mary , this is unreasonable . Give her to me . KELLY Just let her hold the baby for a second . BAKER Look , ma'am , sir . I do n't think I can handle this . Maybe this was n't such a good --  p. 90 KELLY For god 's sake , I 'm just asking to hold her for one minute . BAKER I think we 'd better leave . KELLY You ca n't . KELLY Zelda . KELLY But we have a deal . BAKER I do n't got no deal . I make the deal . KELLY Okay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BAKER What ? Wait a minute . You got ten , but you was just gon na give me five ? Lady , you 're scary . ( Mary tries to leave . Zelda stops her . ) KELLY Mary , you 're a lovely girl and your baby is perfect . KELLY Zelda , it 's over . Lose gracefully . KELLY After everything I put on the line today , we 're going to finish this . BAKER ( crying ) Do n't you get it ? I do n't wan na give up my baby , period , but especially to some desperate bitch like you who thinks money can buy her everything she wants . If you think you can push me around like this , God only knows what you might do to my baby if you do n't get what you want . ( The words hit Zelda like bricks . She ca n't look at Mary , but her body still blocks the doorway ) p. 91 BAKER Now get out of my way . KELLY Mary , please understand . BAKER I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You got ten things , you want eleven . You got a thousand , you want a thousand and one . KELLY I 'm sorry that you have to sell Billie Jo . I know it 's hard . Just let go . Hand her to me . ( The baby CRIES . Mary moves towards the door . ) BAKER No . I do n't think so . KELLY Mary . Give her to me please . I 've got the money here . I 'll pay you upfront ; we can meet with my attorney later . ( Zelda reaches out to take the baby . Mary slaps her hard , shocking Zelda . ) BAKER Leave us alone ! ( The baby cries . Mary is overcome with fear at having hit Zelda . Zelda begins to cry . Danny tries to hold her , but she refuses . The tears stop Mary cold . ) BAKER Aw , ma'am , do n't cry . I 'm sorry ! ( Mary digs in her pocket and comes up with a rumpled tissue . ) BAKER Here . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you . BAKER You do n't look so good , ma'am . You better take care of yourself . Billie Jo and I got ta go now . I 'm sorry we ca n't help you . p. 92 KELLY Mary . Wait . Do n't leave . KELLY Zelda , enough . KELLY Mary , what if I gave you five thousand dollars ? ( Mary stops and glances back at Zelda . She takes another step towards the door and then turns back and unleashes her frustration on Zelda . ) BAKER I told you , I ai n't sellin ' her ! KELLY I mean , what if I just gave it to you ? ( starts looking for checkbook , ca n't find it ) BAKER You mean and I get to keep my girl and all ? KELLY Yes . BAKER Why would you wan na do that ? ( Danny finds his checkbook and hands it to Zelda . ) KELLY For love . BAKER ( misunderstanding ) You do n't love me . ( Zelda takes the checkbook ; she 's extremely moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Danny ) But you love her . ( Zelda writes a check . Mary is unsure about what to do . ) BAKER Yes I do . And I 'm never gon na let anyone try to take her away from me again . p. 93 KELLY Please . Wait , Mary . I want you to have this . KELLY Mary , wait . ( Zelda offers the check to Mary who just looks at it . ) BAKER Is this real ? KELLY Yes . BAKER It wo n't bounce ? KELLY No . BAKER ( nervous ) Lady , I ca n't take this kinda money . KELLY Take it . Please . ( Zelda folds the check and puts it in the baby pouch . ) KELLY Goodbye now . ( Mary leaves slowly . ) BAKER Ma'am , I --  KELLY Do n't mention it , Mary . ( Zelda remembers the suitcase and bassinette . ) KELLY Take this , too . It 's clothes and a bassinette. ( a beat ) What am I thinking ? It 's too heavy for you . KELLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what to say . Thanks . Really , ma'am , sir . No one ever did anythin ' like this for me before . KELLY I 've never done anything like this before either . p. 94 KELLY Me either . KELLY Mary , you have a lot of courage . BAKER Thanks . I grew up when I had my kids . Learn somethin ' new from ' em every day . I hope you find what you 're lookin ' for . KELLY Thanks , Mary . ( Mary leaves with Danny carrying her things . Zelda cries . She espies the teddy bear and grabs it . She hugs it and lies on the bed . She cuddles it and curls into a fetal position . A KNOCK . ) KELLY Sorry , we 're closed . SMITH ( O.S. ) Zelda , it 's me . ( Kale enters . ) KELLY What 's the scoop on Lucinda ? SMITH Let me bring you up to date . KELLY Are you joining us for dinner ? SMITH ( vague ) Yeah . Dinner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KELLY Day of judgment . SMITH Find what you wanted ? KELLY Maybe . I 'm not sure . Thanks for asking . SMITH Uh-huh . KELLY Well , tell me it 's a done deal . I need a break . Everything in order ? p. 95 SMITH You , uh , could say it 's in order . ( Zelda senses trouble and peers quietly at Kale . He stands and starts pacing . ) SMITH Zelda . KELLY Yes . SMITH Zelda , I 'm afraid I have bad news for you . KELLY You mean our deal ? SMITH The deal . KELLY It 's dead ? SMITH ( with extreme difficulty ) You know I have the utmost respect for you . You let me work side by side with you as if I were a partner . I learned a lot from you and I appreciate it . KELLY What happened ? Did she put you through the wringer ? SMITH ( uncomfortable ) Zelda Lucinda 's offered me a job . I 'll , uh , be working closely with her on the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be her assistant ? SMITH She 's asked me to associate produce . ( a beat , softly , with difficulty ) You 're , uh , out of the picture . KELLY What are you talking about ? p. 96 SMITH I 'm talking about an offer I ca n't refuse . KELLY This is n't the mob , Kale . SMITH Maybe it is . Sometimes it feels like it is . KELLY You knew how much I wanted this picture . SMITH Zelda , you have a dozen pictures . This will be my first . KELLY What 'd you do ? Hopscotch naked for her and tie her up with licorice ropes ? SMITH ( genuine , concerned ) Look , you have a right to be pissed off . Anything you want to say to me , I deserve it . KELLY Congratulations . Best of luck to you . SMITH ( surprised ) What ? A-are you okay ? KELLY Probably the best I 've been in years .
