A hospital never goes to sleep : the robot in the pharmacy dispenses drugs 24 hours a day with nearly 100% accuracy ; a chaplain dozes in the sleeping room , with a beeper ; doctors work late into the night , and residents rotate overnight duty every three nights , crashing on couches in the lounge and grabbing snacks from vending machines after the cafeteria closes at 3:30 a.m.
