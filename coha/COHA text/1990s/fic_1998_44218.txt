In the East Texas town where I grew up there were two societies-one composed of the old , the unblemished ( at least publicly so ) , the moneyed . The other was made up of those just below ; that is , those who were faintly flawed , marred in some way by an unfortunate marriage or by the unsavory trade of a grandfather , long dead , or by a public flaunting of some community standard . The differences between the two societies were so minute , their shadings so subtle , that only those of us who lived there and who belonged to one or the other of those two societies could distinguish between them . And although it was never spoken of , certainly not by those in the highest echelon , nor even by those just below , the barrier-unassailable , invisible , impenetrable-was as apparent to those who belonged to one of these two societies as is a stone fence to a rider attempting to jump the fence . <p> I was reminded of this yesterday at the Country Club where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great-aunt , had taken my young son , Robert V , for a swim . Although the town now has three country clubs , the one I refer to is , of course , the one built at the turn of the century by a lumber man , Lawrence Hudson , whose descendants still enjoy the revenue from vast holdings of timber in Arkansas , Louisiana , and East Texas . <p> Driving past the modest gate posts that mark the entrance into the grounds , I was immediately conscious that here was a world of order . The narrow drive , curving gracefully for a mile or more , which is bordered by an excellent golf course on one side and on the other by magnificent pines ( here , only nature is permitted such lavishness ) , leads one to the clubhouse , and here , too , there is the old , the established . The architecture is restrained and solid . The white wooden rockers on the wide verandah are ample , the ballroom floor is lightly polished , the chintzes on the sofas and chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great distance away from the Country Club , geographically and , I hope , psychologically , when I drove to the Club yesterday , there was a pleasant sense that I had in some manner regained or even returned to my rightful place in that quaint and beautiful town . Perhaps Cinco felt it , too , because he jumped right into the pool and immediately began diving for pennies with three other children , while I , a male invading , and very much aware that I was invading , the domain of women , ordered a beer and stood by the diving board , distancing myself from the three women in bathing suits who reclined in those wonderfully comfortable chairs at the shallow end of the pool , watching their offspring play with my son . <p> Seeing their tanned skins , their white teeth , their manicured nails , I thought of my wife . Totally without artifice ( and comfortable in four languages ) , Rosemarie swims in the lakes and seas of Europe and Indonesia . And thinking of her , I wondered what those women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , what they now saw as they looked at me . Seeing a blond-headed man as tanned as they , they 'd first wonder who he was , and who or what had brought him to their town . <p> The women had not recognized me . And how could they ? Both my teeth and my eyes had been straightened soon after we moved away , and now I was twenty years older and as many pounds lighter . But from behind my dark glasses , I had looked at the women long enough to remember who they were . Margaret Carter had been a cheerleader . Today her swim suit was red , but in her last year in high school she had almost always worn white , a conceit she had begun , she confessed to me one Christmas , after reading a single poem by Emily Dickinson . The woman in the blue suit would be Lillian , the daughter of a banker . Her hair golden and with those great , blue eyes . And even in high school those enormous thighs . The third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a judge . She had not been a pretty girl , but some other promise that had been there had been fulfilled , and now she was attractive , a woman to be noticed . These were the women who had been chosen by-no , who had chosen-the football captains and class presidents and valedictorians to go out with ; women , who by virtue of their beauty and family and intelligence would not have noticed me or even known my name had I not been a damn good dancer . <p> Yesterday , as I watched my son in the pool , I had taken a ridiculous pleasure in the way the three women straightened themselves in their chairs , placing brown hands over stomachs they tried to flatten whenever I glanced their way . When Cinco came running up to ask if he could have a hot dog with the other children , I realized how stupid was my pretense at being a stranger . After all , twenty years is a long time , and now , meeting as adults , I would simply tell them who I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I would be at the club . <p> Sending Cinco to rejoin the children in the pool , I ordered a hot dog for him and then walked the length of the pool to where the women sat . Taking off my sunglasses , I extended my hand to Margaret , the woman I had known best . <p> " Hello Maggie . I 'm Robert Moore , " I told her . <p> Frowning up at me , she put her hand over her eyes , making her hand a visor from the sun . " I 'm not sure . . " she began . <p> But then Lillian touched her arm . " Why , Meg , " she said hoarsely , " It 's Bobby Joe . It 's Bobby Joe Moore . You remember . " <p> " Oh , Bobby Joe . Course I remember . Why I remember your whole family , " Margaret said , and there was no doubting the genuine warmth in her voice . " Bobby Joe , I swear that every time Ernest and I get out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really do . " <p> " It 's good to see the three of you . It 's good to be home again , " I told them . And , at that minute , with the sun on my back and the faint chlorine smell of the pool and the wide smiles of the three women , it was good to be home again . <p> Leaning forward , her breasts overflowing the full cups of her suit , Lillian said , " You make yourself a stranger , not coming home any more often than you do . " <p> " Robert Moore , my law , " Margaret said . " That cute little boy must be yours . Is your wife-you are still married , are n't you-in town , too ? " <p> The slight effrontery of her question sharpened my reply . <p> " Rosemarie does n't enjoy East Texas , " I said . " She 's in Mexico with her family . " <p> Margaret leaned back and raised her eyebrows . " Well , not everybody has to like East Texas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times when I 've wanted to leave here myself . " <p> " After spending three months in London and Paris and I do n't know where all last year , this town looked mighty good to me when I got back home , " Lillian said . Her smile remained as she swept her hair up away from her neck . " So your wife is visiting her family in Mexico . I 've never been to Mexico . From what everybody says , Mexico is so . . " <p> " Dirty ? " I finished . Somewhat amused , I waited , knowing the question that hung in the air . I wondered which of the women would fancy herself with the subtlety to ask about the ethnicity of my wife . <p> " In Mexico , " Mary Leigh echoed . " With her family . " <p> The three looked at Cinco . He is dark , they would be thinking . Not that it matters , they would quickly add and later say to each other . <p> As we watched , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression on his face tugged at my heart , but when he dove under the water and emerged laughing in a shower of sun-drenched spray , I relaxed . <p> Finally , it was Margaret , Margaret who had never said an unkind word about anybody all through high school , who found a way to ask . <p> " What 's his name ? What 's your little boy 's name ? " she asked . <p> " He 's named after me , " I said , and some part of me was beginning to enjoy the game . I added , " We call him Cinco . " <p> After a minute , " Cute , " Lillian said , the word falling like gravel . <p> A waiter came from the clubhouse deftly carrying the children 's lunch on a silver tray , and Mary Leigh rose from her chair and walked to the pool 's edge . " You all get out now and come eat your hot dogs . And be nice to this little boy . His name 's Cinco . " Turning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs , snapping it smartly back in place . Her voice was warm . " I 've wondered about you , Bobby Joe . The funniest thing . The day you left , the very day , Rufus had gone to pick up our mail at the station , and he told us you had boarded the afternoon train , going east . I remember because it was the day , the very day after that maid of yours . . . " Fiddling with the right strap of her yellow suit , she gazed at me , wide-eyed . <p> All at once the years fell away and the past-the small ring beside the folded newspaper , a gold star , the smell of gasoline-was before me . Shaken , I told the women that by now Aunt Emily would be wondering what had happened to me , and got Cinco , protesting , out of the pool . <p> Driving to Aunt Emily 's house afterwards , dimly aware of Cinco 's complaints about his abandoned hot dog , I was dismayed by the pain I had felt during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had returned home for the first time when my father had died , but after that only when my presence had been made necessary by Anne 's illness and most recently by her death . Now I had brought Cinco home to Aunt Emily , the last of the " Little Brontes , " as the town affectionately referred to them . Charlotte , my grandmother , had died soon after my father 's birth , leaving his rearing to an indifferent father and to the remaining aunts . Anne had survived well into her eighties , apparently relishing her spinsterhood . But now there was only Emily who , although twice married , had been a widow most of her life . My great affection for her had always been returned , I felt , in like measure . And when she had written : " I want you to bring Robert home . The child needs his people , and , Lord knows , I need him , " I immediately planned the trip home . <p> It seems to me that we all have two homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reared and the second is the one where our children grow up . Now I had returned to my first home , or rather to its memory , for shortly after my father 's death the house was gone . <p> . . Twenty years ago . Her name was Barbara , and I was seventeen . Because of the war a high turnover of domestic employees had begun . Maids came and went with surprising frequency-to join their husbands at an army camp , to take a job in a munitions factory . " Out the back door and gone before they have a chance to learn our ways , " my father would say . <p> " Why work for white folks , " Mother might answer , " when they can make three times as much as a cook at the Lone Star Defense Plant . <p> Even before the new maid had come to work for us , Mother must have seemed unfathomable to her husband . Gazing at her , his brow slightly furrowed , " Barbara , I declare , you sound like you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother would throw back her head and laugh . " Well , I 'm pretty dark , " she might reply , her eyes glistening with humor . I would look at my father , hoping to see the slight smile that would signal his capitulation to Mother 's good spirits , but at such times my father effortlessly resisted what he called Mother 's frivolous nature . Shaking his head , " Barbara , Barbara , " he 'd say in gentle remonstration . <p> Twenty years ago . In the middle of World War II . With an early October chill in the air , the kitchen was cold and , drawn by the rays of the sun , I had come outside to sit on the steps and wait for the new maid to show up and fix breakfast . And when I heard her whistling , I thought it was the iceman , whistling , but no , it was the maid . Barefooted , swinging her shoes in her right hand , she seemed to sway , rather than walk , up the winding drive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her gold earrings and gold necklace , she whistled right up to the steps . When she smiled down at me , the star-shaped gold filling in her front tooth shone like a jewel . Unexpected . <p> " You Bobby , " she said . " Well , I 'm yore mama 's new maid . " <p> Sitting beside me , she brushed the dust off her feet and slipped them into her shoes . " Got to protect these shoes from road wear , " she said . " Sold my last shoe stamps before I went to California to tell my honey goodbye . Rode all the way barefooted . Did n't put my shoes on ' til San Diego . Got off the train looking good . Sure did now . " A note of pleasure in her voice , she fingered the silver ring she wore . Then she put her elbows on the step behind her and lifted her face to the sun . " I just about did n't come to work this morning . I 'd rather a stayed home in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ship . Going somewhere . " The gold star , twinkling , belied the sadness in her voice . <p> I had no idea how to reply . I had never thought about a maid being in her husband 's arms or even considered that a maid might have a husband . If I had thought of a colored 's sexuality at all , it would have been in the context of literature : a cruel plantation owner having his way with a young , colored girl ; a faithful retainer saving a white girl from a carpetbagger . In my mind maids seemed no more than female eunuchs , but now here was my mother 's new maid , talking about staying in the arms of her husband , in bed in the arms of her husband . <p> She did not seem to be in any hurry to cook my breakfast , and there was nothing I could do but wait . Ordinarily , not even my father would ask a maid to perform a task . If I or my sister or even my father wanted something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would ask the maid to do it . After all , she was my mother 's maid . Throwing a quick glance her way , I saw within the mysterious confines of her blue dress the edge of a red brassiere and above it the curve of a dark breast . Oh , Lord , I thought . <p> " What 's your name ? " I asked , dismayed by the squeak in my voice . <p> " Barbara . " <p> " Why , that 's my mother 's name ! Her name 's Barbara ! " <p> " No law against two , " she said comfortably . " I 'm Barbara Conner . " <p> Another first . A maid with a last name . <p> She stood and stretched , slowly raising her shoulders , rolling them back , like a cat , straining the cotton fabric across her breasts , revealing nipples the size of nickels . <p> She smiled . Does she know ? Could she ? I wondered . I crossed my arms over my lap . <p> " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove , see if I can cook you some buttermilk pancakes . You reckon you all got the fixings for that ? " <p> In a few minutes she had the stove going , the kitchen warm , the plates heating on the pilot light , and pretty soon she was placing a stack of pancakes and a pitcher of maple syrup on the table in front of me . Knowing before I took a bite how good they were going to taste , I spread the slowly melting butter over the pancakes and bathed them in maple syrup . She had retreated and was standing , arms crossed , by the kitchen window . Outside on the steps , she had seemed small , but now I saw that she was tall , every bit as tall as Mother . She was also just as slender . At the sound of water running into Father 's bath tub , she looked toward the ceiling . Her neck was unusually long , like a dancer 's . <p> " Reckon that means somebody else will be down here pretty soon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother does n't eat breakfast . And you do n't have to worry about Celia 's . When my father honks , she 'll run downstairs and grab a piece of toast so she can be out of the house and in the car before he honks again . " The maid took a plate from the stove and came toward the table . Will it seem like I 'm correcting her ? What I am about to say ? " My dad does n't eat in the kitchen . He likes peace and quiet while he reads his paper . " <p> " Reckon I 'll just wait then . He can tell me what he wants . " <p> Except for Celia 's hurried footsteps and my father 's more leisurely paced ones , all was quiet upstairs . Two or three times a week Celia had a small crisis . Over her hair : " I ca n't stand it ! " she 'd cry , this followed by Mother 's voice as she took the brush and persuaded both Celia and her hair all was well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she 'd wail and Mother , cajoling , " What about my new cashmere with your blue skirt ? " <p> I buttered another pancake . A mockingbird began its extravagant song . I heard my father 's footsteps coming down the stairs . Cleanshaven and gray-suited , he came briskly into the kitchen . Holding his jacket over his shoulder with his index finger , he sounded hopeful . " So you 're Mrs. Turner 's new maid . What 's your name ? " " Barbara . " Her smile was wide . <p> He frowned , tilted his head to the side . " Barbara , " he said , puzzled . " But Mrs. Turner 's name is Barbara . " His frown deepened . " Well , she 'll work all that out . " A slight smile flickered at the corners of his mouth . " The truth is I smelled those damn pancakes and that got me up and going . You reckon you can cook up a stack for me ? " <p> But the new maid was already pouring batter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a cup of coffee . " I be making apricot preserves to go with some homemade bread after while . Have it ready for yore breakfast in the morning . Sure will now . " Carrying a pot of coffee in one hand and the golden pancakes in the other , with her hip she pushed open the swinging door between the kitchen and the dining room . <p> " I 'll just eat in here this morning . Keep Bobby company . " Father rubbed his hands together , pulled a chair away from the table . She nodded . " That way the pancakes still be hot when they gets to the table . " <p> My father never ate in the kitchen . Suddenly the day was filled with possibility . The war would end , his business would improve , Mother would like living in the South . <p> " I 've never known a girl to catch on so fast , " Father said the next day and the day after . And said to his wife a few days later at the dinner table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more time to get into things . " <p> " Get into things ? " Distastefully she stirred her coffee , added cream . <p> My father retreated . A little . " You know , help Celia . With the house running smoothly , you might plan a little party for Celia 's friends . A Christmas party . Just yesterday the Little Brontes remarked that the Christmas season would begin soon . " <p> Mother sighed , a long , shuddering sigh that suggested a terminal illness or some other impending disaster . She removed the gold ring on her finger , gazed at it , and replaced it . <p> " Robert , Celia 's too young to be pushed into all this debutante business . It seems quite unnecessary . " <p> " Unnecessary ? " He was genuinely puzzled . <p> " With the war going on . You know the minute Bobby 's eighteen they 'll take him . Even with his eyesight . They 're taking everybody now . " <p> " Dad , I 'm ready now . I want to get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army last week . His father signed the papers . " <p> Her eyes filled . " Oh , Bobby . " <p> " How in the hell did we get on this subject ! " My father 's face was slightly flushed ; his voice was raised . " We 're talking about a little Christmas party for Celia and her friends . We 're not talking about the war , for God 's sake , excuse me Barbara . " He clamped his lips together . A muscle on the right side of his face tightened . " Celia has to live here after all , and somebody has to help her . " <p> Mother 's heart was ardent , always , and easily moved by frailty or sorrow . Looking back , it seems as if she was forever trying to right some unknowable wrong that had been done my father or heal some grievous wound he had suffered-suffered , perhaps , as a result of his being a motherless child . For always , when I was crossways with him , " Remember , Bobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a mother . " <p> Whatever the reason , at dinner that night her righteousness dissolved into pity . She reached across the table and took his hand and held it against her cheek . She kissed it . <p> My father played his trump card . " You know the Little Brontes love the children , and they love you too . They 'll help . It has n't been that long since they went through this . " <p> " I 'll call them , " she promised . <p> Oh , this mother of mine . Unlike any other . At once the source of my greatest pride , my most abject despair . I was painfully aware that my friends , jabbing elbows into each other 's ribs , falling onto the living room rug in exaggerated excitement whenever she left the room , noticed her loosely bound bosoms and saw the sway of her hips , although in my presence , they dared only remark on her long hair , as unconfined as her bosoms . But she was as indifferent to their crazy teenage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as indifferent as she was to the ladies ' Friday afternoon bridge parties and to the Sunday tea dances at the Club . While the other mothers carefully counted their tricks and politely tallied their scores at bridge , my mother was teeing off , usually by herself , or worse yet , suited out and swimming laps in the pool . <p> In the early years of marriage , my father gently urging , would say , " Do n't you enjoy their company ? Would n't you enjoy sitting with them and watching our children swim . " <p> And she , a newcomer , ( " Your mother 's a Yankee ! " Butch Henderson had called out when I was in first grade , the other children taking it up , crying , Yankee , Yankee , Yankee ! ) , would answer , " Oh , Mark . It 's tiresome . All that talk about lazy maids and bridge hands when the whole country is in the middle of a depression . " <p> But , now , she invited the aunts to tea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserves her new maid has cooked . The aunts made suggestions , at first hesitantly . " Do you think Celia would enjoy ballroom dancing lessons ? This is the time to learn , " Anne said . " Then at Christmas a little party for her friends . A tea dance . At the Club . " <p> Emily , twice-widowed and financially sound , loved the idea of a party , especially one that would please my father . " Or what about a Mardi Gras ball later in the season . Celia will be sixteen then . It would be a masque party . Young people love costumes . " She took a hot scone , split it , and spooned apricot preserves into it . <p> Anne nodded . " That would give us more time . We 'll have to go to Neiman 's for her dress . " <p> My mother leaned back in her chair and splayed her legs out before her , deliberately evoking raised eyebrows . " What about a hunt breakfast ? We could ship the horses in from Virginia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pulled their chairs close . " Now Barbara , be serious . " <p> She pulled her mane of black hair forward over her shoulder , sat straight in her chair , feet together , the very picture of compliance . <p> " Let 's make a list , " she said . <p> After dinner , she read the list . The aunts beamed . Her husband was confounded . " My God , excuse me Barbara , that would cost a fortune ! " <p> She smiled and reached for his hand . " We 'll have Celia 's party here . At the house . With lots of flowers and good food and somebody in to help Barbara . And a piano player . " <p> Celia burst into tears . " I 'd be so embarrassed ! Nobody has parties at their house . Nobody will come . Nobody ! If I ca n't have a party at the Club , I just wo n't have a party at all ! " She stormed out of the room . <p> " Barbara , Celia 's still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celia 's rheumatic fever we always tried not to upset her . <p> The Little Brontes agreed . The party must be at the Club . <p> After this a kind of serenity descended upon our household . The kitchen was filled with the sound of Barbara whisking egg whites into airy mounds for vanilla flavored custard and shucking sweet corn and filled , too , with the smell of corn bread and ham baking in the oven . And the maid 's whistling . " " Though there 's one engine gone , we will still carry on , " she whistled cheerfully . " Coming in on a wing and a prayer . " <p> After school I cruised through the kitchen , lifting the tops of stove vessels to see what dinner would bring . " Have you heard from . . " What to call this man I imagine as always in her bed . Your soldier ? Mister Conner ? Mister ? Barbara waited , hands on her hips . " ... your husband , " I finished . <p> She beamed and the gold star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She patted her apron pocket . " Read it so many times I knows it by heart . Want to hear it ? " When I nodded , " Bobby , you set here and shuck this corn for Barbara , And I 'll say it for you . You got time ? " <p> The other Barbara ( I had begun to call her this ) sat across the table and each of us took up a roasting ear . She recited : <p> My sweet woman , they give me a gun yesterday , a rifle . Before that I just been bringing supplies back and forth , back and forth . I reckon the white boys seen they need all the firepower they can get and they handed me this gun . " Can you shoot ? " the man said . I shot the limb off a tree and he nodded and left in his jeep . Some say we 'll fight over here and some say across the river , but as for me I just wants to get home to you , my sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You too young for the rest . " My father began to take his breakfast in the kitchen , eating silently , saying only " Good morning , Barbara , " and when he finished , " Thank you , Barbara . " But he frequently praised her to Mother . " Barbara , ask your maid to make some more bread pudding . Until she served it last week , I thought the making of bread pudding was a lost art . " <p> In October , Celia , accompanied by the aunts , drove to Dallas to choose a dress . " Barbara , do n't you want to go ? The child might need your advice about a dress , " my father said . <p> " No , dear . The aunts have insisted the dress will be a gift . Knowing Celia , I 'm afraid she 'll show no mercy when it comes to cost . Of time or money . Robert , it does seem so foolish to spend all this money . Things have n't been going well at the store . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is not the time . . " <p> He cupped her chin in his hand . " Now do n't you worry about money . That 's my job . " <p> She brushed his hand away . " Oh , Robert , " she said despairingly . <p> That afternoon Wayne Schuster , who by working for his father and carrying two paper routes had managed to buy an old Chevy , gave me a ride home . Turning into the driveway , I saw the two women sitting on the back steps , barefooted , their skirts hiked above their knees to catch any breeze that might come their way . Mother was almost as dark as the other Barbara and from this distance , coming upon them , they might have been sisters . As we watched , Mother , overtaken with mirth , threw her head back and slapped her thigh , and the other Barbara , with a hand on each knee , laughed along with Mother , a rollicking laugh that bounced through the open windows of the Chevy . <p> " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " So ? Want to make something of it ? " My fist was in his face , threatening him , and he drew back , astonished . I slammed the car door , and Wayne took off , squealing his tires around the corner . As I stalked across the yard , Mother said , " Oh , Bobby , Barbara just told me the funniest joke about Hitler . A colored man went up to ... " <p> She stopped when she saw my face , and I stormed into the house without a word to the other Barbara . Throwing myself on my bed , I could hear Mother 's voice , sounding not at all disturbed , blending with her maid 's . <p> I lay there , willing my father to come . I wanted him to see them . I wanted him to do something . But when I heard his car in the drive , my stomach tightened . I got up and went to the window . Dad closed the car door and walked quickly across the lawn . " Mrs. Moore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Our family was often divided into two camps . I identified with my mother . As I saw it , we were both outcasts-I , because of my lazy eye and my acne and , also ( I felt this acutely at times ) , because of my mother . She was from the north-a Yankee , a newcomer , continually flaunting the mores and customs of the town . <p> Now , hearing my father 's voice , iced by controlled fury , I had an inkling of his humiliation . We had , as they say , come down in the world , come down in that small East Texas world . But it was only a monetary decline . We still had family-the two aunts , who were beyond reproach , and we had my father 's ancestors-a greatgrandfather who had been a Texas congressman and a great-great aunt who had become the fifty-three-year-old bride of a man who had once been the governor of Texas . But in that one brief moment in Wayne Schuster 's car I saw that Mother was hastening our downfall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time , I felt vindicated as I listened to my father 's angry voice . <p> " Barbara , sitting out there , barefooted , for all the world to see ! And with your skirt hiked up over your head ! Dammit ! Barbara ! " <p> And for the first time his use of a curse word in Mother 's presence was not followed by an apology . <p> Hearing Mother 's soft knock on my door that night , I remained silent , my eyes fixed on my open book . She came in and sat on the edge of my bed . I kept my eyes on the book . She took it from my hand , placed a book marker in it and closed it . <p> " Bobby ? " <p> " Mother , he 's right ! You did look like a maid this afternoon . Wayne Schuster was shocked . I was humiliated . " <p> " Oh , Bobby . You and Wayne Schuster ! You do n't even know that there 's a world out there , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll soon find out there 's more to be shocked about than your mother sitting on the back steps with the best damn , excuse me , Bobby , as your father would say , maid we 've ever had ! " The ice that had been in my father 's voice when he spoke to Mother had traversed into hers as she spoke to me . Stung into silence , I did not answer and after a minute she left the room . <p> Now , my father , although he dared not fire Mother 's maid , found a dozen reasons for her dismissal . Mother found a hundred reasons to keep her . Under my father 's polite , remorseless siege , I found myself again allied with Mother . <p> Once again , my father had his breakfast served in the dining room where he rarely spoke to the maid . And she went heavily about her tasks , sighing often . She refused to make my father 's favorites-bread pudding ( takes too much sugar ) , fried okra ( too much bacon grease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was heart and soul on Mother 's side . I was changing a tire the day I heard the other Barbara ask Mother for money . " I hates to ask . I surely does . You got so much on you right now , but Doctor Bruce he say I need to have this knot out , and he has to have the money for the procedure . " <p> Mother put her arm around her maid 's shoulders . " Oh , I am sorry . Does it hurt ? " Her voice was full of compassion . <p> " No'am . But he say it will . " <p> " Of course you can have the money . I 'll speak to Mr. Moore tonight . How much does Doctor Bruce need ? " <p> " He say fifty now and fifty later . " <p> " I 'll speak to my husband tonight . " <p> Throughout the war , at precisely six-thirty , maids from households all over town would slip into the falling darkness , allowing back screen doors to whisper to a close behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news . All activity would cease and chairs would be drawn close to the radio . My father would settle into his leather chair , Mother would take the rocker , and I would sit on the floor to be as close to the news as possible . <p> This night Walter Winchell began as usual : " Good-evening , Mr. and Mrs. North America and all the ships at sea . It 's bad news tonight . In the Ardennes the Germans have breached our defenses and are only one hundred miles from Antwerp . If the U.S. Defense . . " <p> Mother stood and turned off the radio . <p> " Barbara ! " my father said . <p> " Robert , our maid needs money for surgery . It 's quite serious . " <p> " Where does she plan to get this money ? " <p> " Why Robert , from us , of course . " <p> Rising from his chair , he slapped a folded newspaper against his leg . " It 's out of the question . " <p> Mother 's hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Our expenses are heavy . I do n't have it . Barbara , you know what the war has done to my business . You 've been in the store . " <p> " I know how much we 're spending on Celia 's Christmas party . " <p> " That is totally irrelevant . " <p> " Not to me . " <p> With a final whack against his leg , and " No , Barbara . And that 's final , " he left the room . <p> Seeing the shocked disbelief on Mother 's face , I longed to be able to give her the money . <p> The next morning Mother , still in her pink gown and robe , was down before my father . " Barbara , I 'm going to work something out today . You tell Dr. Bruce to schedule the surgery . " <p> The other Barbara turned from the sink , her shoulder blades wings beneath her yellow dress . " I thank you , Miss Barbara . And I wrote my sweetie . He 'll send the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the icebox , she clasped her hands beneath her chin . " Trouble is , I ai n't heard lately . Nothing . And last night I had this dream . " Her voice was mournful , almost keening . " He wore dead in my dream , on the ship . Now his spirit got to haunt the ship . " She shook her head repeatedly as if denying her dream . <p> " Barbara , there 's no such thing as a ghost . It was just a dream . You 'll hear from him soon . Try not to worry . " Mother turned to leave , turned back . " And , Barbara , we wo n't mention the surgery to anyone , " she said , before hurrying upstairs . The other Barbara understood as well as I that by anyone she meant my father . <p> I know , as well as if I had been there , what must have happened at the jeweler 's that morning . Mother , her head held high , would have walked into the store , removed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square of black velvet . She would then have taken from her purse the diamond that had belonged to her mother and placed it beside her wedding band . " Dick , I want to sell one of my rings , " she said . " Whichever will bring a hundred dollars . " <p> Now Mother knew that Dick Morris was one of my father 's oldest friends . Their friendship , begun in Miss Elam 's Day School when they were five , had sustained itself by virtue of age . Although they seldom saw each other , on social occasions such as a christening or a funeral or a wedding , Dick Morris was always in attendance . " I can count on old Dick to be there when he 's needed , " Father was fond of saying . <p> In Dick 's mind , being confronted with Mother 's rings on the black velvet square would have seemed an occasion amounting to a crisis . He would have contrived a courteous excuse to leave Mother 's presence , leaving her unsuspecting , and hurried to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , what he could have said to my father . And what would have been his tone-cajoling ? amused ? Sympathetic ? when he said it ? But I know , because the other Barbara told me , that when he and mother returned to the house about noon , he opened the car door for her , escorted her to the house and , without a word , drove back to his office . Mother went immediately upstairs . There she moved his things from her room to the guest room at the end of the hall . <p> When I came from school , Mother and the other Barbara were again on the back steps . Today their dresses , Mother 's best navy blue and Barbara 's familiar yellow , were tucked demurely below their knees . Mother 's face was pale , her expression serious , her grief palpable . I spoke , and they replied . But then they were silent , waiting to resume their conversation when I had left . <p> But as I entered the house , I did hear Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartbreaking war , the hardware business is difficult . But , tell Dr. Bruce that we . . " I am sure she said ' we , ' and that was all I heard . <p> Mother 's maid did not come to work on Monday . On Tuesday , a glimmer of gold on the dining table caused me to veer from my path to the kitchen . Mother 's gold ring lay beside Father 's folded newspaper . Gazing down at the ring and at Father 's carefully folded paper , I sensed the emotional storm that was about to engulf our family . But it never occurred to me that the other Barbara would be at the eye of the storm . <p> Our maid was gone a week . If Mother knew the reason for her absence , she did not say . Father never asked . We came down to a cold kitchen and had cold cereal and left the house as soon as we could . Father continued to use the room across the hall , and only one time did he knock on Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Barbara , " he called softly . " Barbara , please . " If she answered , I did not hear her . <p> A week later , the other Barbara returned to work . When I came down and saw her at the kitchen sink , my heart lifted . " Barbara ! " I said . " Here you are ! You 're back ! " <p> She nodded and smiled ( such a small smile ) , her lips curling around her teeth . " What you want for breakfast ? " <p> " Barbara , I do n't care . But where have you been ? I 've missed you . Mother 's missed you , too . I know she has , " I said , believing still that all would be well . <p> " I be all right , right soon , " she said . " Done had my procedure . " It was when she stooped to get the iron skillet from a stove drawer that she grimaced , and I saw the gaping hole where her gold-star tooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , shocked by the change in her appearance . <p> She covered her mouth with her hand . " Ai n't nothing to be done about it , " she said . Placing my breakfast before me , she touched my shoulder . " It all right , Bobby . Just a tooth . " <p> " No . It 's not all right , " Mother said softly . Neither of us had heard her come down . Wearing the velvet robe Father had given her on her birthday , she stood , with her hands in the pockets , her chin thrust forward . " Barbara , I 'm glad you 're back . We 've missed you . We 'll have a little visit after breakfast . " <p> At Celia 's wail , " Mother , I ca n't find my red sweater ! " she turned to go back upstairs just as Father came down . " Robert , Barbara 's back . She had her surgery . She sold her gold star tooth to pay for it , " she said , speaking as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would work it out , " he said reasonably . <p> " Robert , I never intend to be placed in that position again . " <p> The next day she was dressed before we left for school . She dressed early the next day and the next . The following Monday , Judge Baker , my father 's first cousin once removed , stopped by the hardware store for " a little visit . " <p> Father could not contain his rage when he entered the house that evening . " Goddamnit , Barbara , do you know what you 're doing to me ? " he shouted , not caring that Celia and I could hear every word . " Going all over town , looking for a job . As if a man ca n't take care of his family . I do n't understand you , Barbara . What in God 's name do you want ? " <p> " Robert , you really do n't know , do you ? You have n't any idea , " she said , a sad wonder in her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Miss Barbara , all this here ai n't necessary . It wore just a tooth , " she said . <p> " It 's more than a tooth , Barbara . It 's much more than a tooth . " Later that afternoon , I heard them laughing , giggling like schoolgirls . Maybe she 's not going to leave us , I thought . I knocked on the door . <p> " Come in , Bobby , " Mother called cheerfully . " We 're talking about ghosts . This girl believes in ghosts . Tell him , Barbara . " <p> " I has to haunt the house where I passes . All us coloreds knows it . " So caught up was she in the telling that for the first time she forgot to cover her mouth . " All I wants is for yore mama to say that if I dies here , here in this house , she be here too . With me . " <p> " Oh , Barbara , you 're not going to die , " Mother said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do n't want no strangers round . I wants them I knows . If I passes here , you got to come back . " <p> " But you are not going to die , " Mother said . " Your sweetie will come home from the war , and you 'll live happily ever after . " Mother , excited by what she was about to do , was taking her clothes from hangers and tossing them on the bed for her maid to pack . " I got to know . " <p> " All right , I promise , " Mother said gaily . <p> When she was packed , I took her bags downstairs , and she called a taxi . When she came down , she made her hand into a fist and touched my chin . " Bobby , you 're a man now , " she said . " But I want you to promise you 'll wait to be drafted . Do n't join the army . Promise ? Will you promise ? " <p> In our family , promises were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shook my head . " Oh , Mother , " I said . But then she looked so stricken that I said , " I 'll wait . I promise . " <p> Talking to herself , the other Barbara came slowly down the stairs . " A tooth do n't matter , " she muttered . " You 'd think Hitler had come in here on us . Or that gorilla had caught Ma Perkins . A tooth ai n't nothing . " She started to the kitchen . <p> " Wait a minute , Barbara , " Mother said . " I want a promise from you , too . " <p> " Yes ma'am . " She turned and came back , her face alive with eagerness to promise anything , everything . <p> " I want you to find enough sugar to make bread pudding for Mr. Moore . Will you ? " <p> The other Barbara frowned . <p> Mother chuckled . " Promise . I want your promise . " <p> " I will , " her maid said solemnly . " And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't hold with good-byes . " <p> All that afternoon Celia had refused to come out of her room , but now she stormed out , sobbing , throwing herself into Mother 's arms , begging her to stay . And when Mother refused , she made a frantic telephone call to our father . But he could not stop her . Somehow , perhaps from Aunt Emily , she had the money for her ticket . <p> After Mother left Barbara continued to work for us , becoming thin and stooped as the weeks passed , growing old before our eyes . I do n't know why she stayed on . Perhaps , she did not have the energy to find another job , or perhaps she hoped Mother would return . Just after Christmas a telegram came , and a gold star was hung in the house of her husband 's mother . But she said nothing about her husband 's death to us . She came to work , trudging determinedly up the drive , almost every day . Several times I found her hunched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with perspiration . Once , her voice a whisper , she said , " Bobby , my medication . In my handbag . And bring old Barbara some water . " <p> I hurried to do as she had asked . And when the pain receded , she patted my hand . " You a good boy , Bobby , " she said . <p> I wrote Mother then and asked her to come home . She replied , saying she felt her work in Washington was useful to the war effort . <p> On a cold Friday in February , the teachers had a planning day , and the school was closed . I stopped by the house to pick up my golf clubs and change clothes . When I saw Barbara , wraith-like , dragging herself and a gas can up the back steps , I thought she was doing some special cleaning . " Do n't work too hard , " I called , but she did not hear me . Oh , the sky was blue that day , the air so clear it pierced the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started into the house . Then I smelled the fumes , heard the poof of the explosion , called her name . I saw her . Engulfed in flames , she sat in a kitchen chair , her mouth open in a silent cry of anguish , her hands raised in helpless supplication . <p> I yelled to a passing car and ran for the garden hose . But she was dead before I could drag the hose into the kitchen . <p> The fire department came so fast that only a circle around the kitchen chair was damaged . " What in the world could that nigger have been thinking of , " the fireman said . " Why , she could have burned your house to the ground ! " <p> The next day I caught a train to Washington , and I lived there with Mother until I was drafted . Celia chose to stay with our father and the Little Brontes . When the war ended , I was on a ship in the South Pacific , never having fired a shot in combat . <p> Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt some pity , some affection for her husband . At any rate , when I was drafted , she came home and lived with Father until he died , quite suddenly , ten years after the war 's end . When the house was struck by lightning and burned to the ground , Mother , released from her promise to her maid , went back to Washington and lives there still , an adoring grandmother and a loving , gentle mother to me and Rosemarie when she visits . She has never spoken of that sad time . <p> After a week with Aunt Emily , Cinco and I rejoined Rosemarie in Mexico . My first evening at home , we had one of those perfect dinners-leisurely and beautiful with good food and wine and candlelight-that spring from the joy of reunion . After dinner we sat on the balcony and I , stirred by old memories , carefully recounted those last months and weeks of that other Barbara 's life to my wife . " Poor things , " she said , when I had finished . " Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her worn Shakespeare from our library and read to me that haunting passage , the one that begins , " My mother had a maid called Barbara " and ends : " She had a song of willow / And she died singing it .
