DEEPLY IN LOVE , LIZZIE AND ANDY MARRIED QUICKLY , BELIEVING PASSIONATELY IN THEIR FUTURE . BUT SOON THEY WOULD FIND JUST HOW LITTLE THEY KNEW ABOUT EACH OTHER . WAS THEIR LOVE STRONG ENOUGH TO LAST ? <p> Andy was in Venezuela . He 'd been gone nearly three weeks , the first time they 'd been apart since the wedding , the longest separation since they 'd met . Had that been only six months ago ? He 'd phoned every day except one , and that had been the worst day Lizzie ever lived through . The following morning he called at dawn . " I was really busy yesterday , " he said , " and when I had a minute to call you , I could n't get through . Sometimes the phones here just do n't work . " She was a legal assistant , and she 'd been busy at work , too , where she 'd become something of a celebrity . " Storybook romance , whirlwind courtship , dream wedding , " the head of the research department , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " How on earth did you manage it ? " " She 's pea green with envy , " her friend Anita snickered . All Lizzie could think about was their new apartment . She spent every spare second poring over decorating magazines and furniture catalogs . " I want it to be perfect when Andy gets home , " she told Anita . She haunted stores , finding some treasures in a cluttered little place called This &; That , run by a rather strange , middle-aged man named Edmund Aynsley , who was decidedly unhelpful until his huge cat began following Lizzie around . " Angus seldom likes strangers , " he said , and as if that were a signal , he began following Lizzie , too , making suggestions , giving advice . She found several items she loved . Edmund gave her good prices on them . When she explained she was newly married and decorating a small apartment from scratch , he took charge . " You must not act too quickly , " he warned . " This is the first important project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered everything she 'd selected in a small van , bringing along Angus and a man called Joe to help carry the furniture up the three flights . Joe spoke not a word , but Edmund had a lot to say when he saw the apartment . " It has real possibilities . That window is nice , and so is the view . Good wall space . Angus obviously approves . " Angus had settled himself on the windowsill . " Does your husband have a favorite color ? " Edmund asked her . " Before you get into drapes or any permanent colors , you should consider what he likes . " " I have no idea . " She was as stunned by that as he was . " Well , some men do n't care , of course . But I 'd hold off on drapes " til you 're sure . That perfect man of yours needs to have some say . It does seem you 're just getting to know each other . " " We are . " " Risky , " Edmund said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered where he best judged they should go . LIZZIE WAS PLANNING TO TAKE THE DAY OFF TO MEET ANDY at the airport , but when she mentioned it on the phone , he objected . " No need , Lizzie . My company provides a car service . Why should you come all the way to the airport ? It 's an international arrival , which means Customs , all kinds of possible delays . Just be there when I get home , okay ? " " Okay , " she said , and the more she thought about it , the more wonderful it seemed to keep their first moments together private . His plane was due at 4:30 P.M. At 4:00 , Lizzie phoned the airline : It was on time . At 6:30 , when she had n't heard from him , she phoned again : The flight had landed on schedule . She set her new dining room table for dinner . It was an old Pembroke table , the first thing she 'd found in Edmund 's shop that she absolutely had to have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's had a hard life , " he guessed , stroking it fondly . " But it 's still sturdy . Cover it with damask for dinner , or silk to the floor for every day , and you 'll have a valuable treasure . " She used a Madeira cloth that had been her grandmother 's . Then she set the table with something from everyone who 'd been so good to them on such short notice-sterling flatware from her mother , crystal wineglasses from Cordelia , candlesticks from her brother and sister-in-law . A crystal bowl from Anita made the perfect centerpiece holding two extravagant pink peonies that she 'd picked up on the way home from work . At 7:40 Andy finally arrived , struggling with his key in the lock . She had the CD player on . At first she did n't hear him . She ran to open the door , and he nearly fell into the room . He was drunk-stumbling , staggering drunk . When he tried to kiss her , the smell on his breath was overwhelming , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Long day , " he mumbled , heading down the hall . " Tough trip . " She was glad she had n't lit the candles . When he did n't reappear , she went into the bedroom and found him sprawled across their bed , fully dressed with his shoes on her new duvet , sound asleep-snoring , in fact . She pulled off his shoes and left him there . She switched off the romantic music , then slammed around the kitchen , putting things away . Her wonderful casserole went into the freezer . She put her beautiful china , crystal , and sterling away with icy care . She left the cloth and the flowers on the table . She wanted to leave , but she had nowhere to go , so she slumped on the little love seat Edmund had helped her choose and turned on the television . She never glanced at it . Drunk . He was drunk . Maybe it was a onetime thing , too many drinks on the plane , too long a trip with too little to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an excuse , " her mother used to say . " Every time , it 's never going to happen again . " Her father 's drinking had ruined their lives-and killed him . Her mother blamed herself . " If I had n't screamed at him that last night , he would n't have gone out , would n't have taken the car . " He 'd crashed , but he did n't die for three horrible weeks . He lay helpless in a hospital bed , breathing but already gone from them . " If he had n't been drunk , he would n't have had the accident , " her uncle said , trying to pull Lizzie 's mother from the wreckage of the tragedy . A long time afterward , her mother said , " If he had n't been a drunk , we would have had a life . I loved him so much , but I did n't love him drunk . He destroyed us both with his drinking . " Lizzie had observed Andy 's drinking before , several times , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd met at a big , boisterous Christmas party , an annual event given by their mutual friends Rich and Kara . Lizzie noticed Andy as soon as she arrived because he was the only person in the room she did n't recognize . He noticed her noticing him and came right over , grinning broadly . " Lizzie Morgan , " he said . " I 'm Andy Fry . Rich and Kara have told me all about you . " " And why have n't they told me about you ? " He laughed . " Nothing to tell . " Nothing to tell . Maybe there was something they should have told her besides the fact that Rich and Andy had been college roommates . Rich always drank at parties , Lizzie realized . Maybe that was why neither he nor Kara ever said anything about Andy 's drinking . Andy took Lizzie home from that party , they 'd kissed , and then she 'd sent him on his way , gently . He phoned her at work the next day and asked her out . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very quickly , they were talking about marriage , drunk on each other . Early in their courtship , the night Andy met her mother , he had n't had anything to drink . Lizzie was sort of surprised at the time , but she forgot about it . Her mother was terribly pleased ; she mentioned it a lot . However , he got spectacularly loaded at his bachelor party . Rich told Lizzie all about it . He laughed , so she did . That was a week before the wedding . And Andy had gotten tipsy on their wedding night , but so had she . Since then , there 'd been only one occasion when she 'd been aware of his drinking , a night that he 'd come home a bit later than expected , his speech slightly slurred , after entertaining clients . Now it was very late . Lizzie went into the bedroom and found Andy still sprawled across their bed , still asleep . She took a pillow and blanket ; she 'd sleep on the love seat . She tossed , squirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exhausted , she marched into the bedroom , ready to push Andy to the floor , but he had turned and was taking up less room . She settled on her side of the bed , close to the edge , and finally fell asleep . She woke early , but he was already up and showering . She stumbled into the kitchen , her head aching , her neck stiff . He was suddenly there , shaved , dressed , smiling . He kissed her on the forehead and stayed close to nuzzle . She backed away . " Good morning , " he said cheerfully . She glared at him . " Oops ! Apologies , first I am so sorry- " She turned away . She would have left the room , but the kitchen was too narrow ; she 'd have to touch him to get past him . " Lizzie ? " He sounded confused . He put a hand on her shoulder . " Is this about last night ? Lizzie , look at me . " She looked at him-and wished she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had a crooked grin on his face that almost made her smile . " Lizzie ? " " You were drunk , Andy . Were you drunk when you got off the plane , or would it have made a difference if I 'd met you at the airport ? " " I had n't eaten . The food on the flight was inedible , and we were talking business , having a few- " " A few ? " He was n't grinning anymore . " A few too many . I 'm sorry . I know it was rotten for you after being alone for three weeks- " " My father was an alcoholic , Andy . He killed himself in a car because he was too drunk to drive it . He and my mother loved each other , and he killed that too . " " You never told me . " " I know I should have told you , but I hate to talk about it . And I 'm sure there 's a lot you have n't told me . We really do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love each other . I love you . " " Sometimes that 's not enough . I know my mother thought it should be , and when it was n't , she blamed herself . I 'm not going to do that . I 'm not going to live like that " " I 'm not a drunk , Lizzie . " " Are you sure ? You drink a lot . " He frowned . " I need to get to the office . We 'll talk about this later . " " There 's nothing to talk about . " He left the kitchen . " Later . " She stayed where she was until she heard the front door slam . She could n't even cry . She was late getting to work and so frazzled when she arrived , she could n't cope with Cordelia 's tantrum , which was in progress , so she fled to the ladies " room . Anita came in behind her . " What 's wrong ? Are you sick ? Did Andy get in all right ? " Lizzie shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Andy , but I 'll quit if Cordelia screams at me . " " Oh , my . She 's screaming at everyone and everything . She was yelling at her computer . " " I 'm going to the library . Tell her I 'm late with that research for Mr. Bellows . Tell her anything . " Lizzie felt guilty leaving Anita , but Cordelia would calm down eventually , and Lizzie needed to hang on to her job . She had a lot of bills to pay , and she might be paying them alone . Alone . She felt sick . She wanted to phone her mother , but it would n't be fair to open all those old wounds . This was her problem . She went to the library , had to wait for the books she wanted , then struggled to concentrate . She was usually good at this , which was why everyone in the firm was always asking her to do research for them . She was grateful to be doing it today , when she needed to be in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so she could n't think about anything else . She returned to the office and began to feel really rotten about 4:00 in the afternoon , when she realized she had n't eaten all day . Anita told her she looked sort of green . On her way back from a break , Anita brought Lizzie a milk shake , which Lizzie inhaled . It was sweet , filling , and wonderful . Cordelia had an appointment outside the office . " I wo n't be back today , " she announced , sailing toward the elevators . " You should go too , " Anita said to Lizzie as soon as they were sure Cordelia had gone . Lizzie did n't say anything , but her apartment was the last place she wanted to be . She kept working on her research project . She 'd been given a week to complete it , and it was almost done . She had a cheeseburger on her way home . She thought about going to a movie , but she walked instead . She was in a zone ; not thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-flight climb to her apartment seemed long for the very first time . Others had complained about it , but she 'd never minded it before . She put her key in the lock , and the door swung open . Andy stood there . " Where 've you been ? Do you know what time it is ? You left your office hours ago-I phoned there ! " She dropped onto the love seat and shook off her shoes . Her feet hurt . He sat down next to her . " I even phoned your mother . Now she 's worried . " " I 'd better call her . " " Stay put . " He came back quickly with the cordless phone and sat next to her again . " Sheila ? Andy . She 's home . " He handed Lizzie the receiver . " Hi , Mom . " " Lizzie ! Where have you been ? " " I ... got sidetracked on the way home , looking in shop windows . " Her mother said nothing for a moment , then , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband waiting for you . Especially when he 's been away for so long . Is everything- ? " " Everything 's fine , Mom . I 'm sorry I worried you . " " I 've never heard anyone as worried as Andy , " her mother said . " It touched me , it truly did . I wo n't keep you now . " " Thanks , Mom . " " Kiss Andy for me , darling . He 's everything I ever wished for my wonderful girl . " Lizzie handed the phone to him . He got up and put it back on its cradle . The silence between them was heavy . She stared at nothing : She did n't want to look at him . " Lizzie , I 'm sorry . I know coming home like that last night was disgusting . If I 'd known about your father- " " My father was a wonderful man : bright , talented , loving . He had a terrible weakness , an illness , really . It was scary , how different he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it She said the lies were the worst . She believed everything he said , for so long , and then she could n't believe anything he said . She stuck it out . I wo n't . " " One time- " " It 's never just one time , Andy . Everyone said we should wait to get married , get to know each other better . " " I know all I need to know about you . I love you . I 've never loved anyone the way I love you . You want me to stop drinking ? It 's done . " She looked at him . " Do n't say that . It 's not that easy . Do n't trivialize this ! " He sat down again beside her . " Do n't I get a second shot ? One strike , and the ball game 's over ? Maybe you 've had second thoughts while I 've been gone . Maybe I 'm not what you want . " The phone rang , and he rushed to answer it . He handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face grim . " Hello ? " Her voice was thin , wavery . She felt awful . " Edmund Aynsley here . I assume the man who answered was Mr. Wonderful . Sorry to disturb , but I 've found a very interesting chair ... " Andy snatched his keys off the Pembroke table and left the apartment . " Can I phone you tomorrow ? " Lizzie asked . She was trembling . " Of course . I do think we should act quickly , but I 'll speak to you tomorrow . " For a moment , she did n't move . The apartment seemed airless . Then she picked up her shoes and went into the bedroom . She put them in the closet and looked at her running shoes . If she put those on , maybe she could catch up with Andy . Which way had he gone ? She was lacing her shoes when she heard the front door shut . " Andy ? " He filled the doorway to their bedroom . " You were expecting Edmund ? " He did a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home-furnishing shop . He 's a decorator . " ( continued on page 225 ) Andy had to think about that . " tlhe apartment looks great . Do we really need a decorator ? " She laughed . " He does n't charge me anything . I bought several things from him , and he got interested . " " Oh , yeah ? " " Do n't be dumb . He has a cat named Angus . Angus is crazy about me . " He looked totally confused . " You going for a run ? " " I was going to look for you You were n't gone long . " " I know . I turned right around . I want to settle this . I want to solve this . " " So I , " she said , very quietly . He moved to sit beside her . " Maybe I do drink too much . I 've never thought about it . I do n't care about it , but I cat a lot , and sometimes I drink a lot . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All I want-and need-is to be with you , to love you , live with you for the rest of my life . I hated this trip because you were n't with me . Yesterday , we had a major crisis in Caracas just before we were to come back . Someone had to stay behind ; they wanted me to do it , but I said , No way . " The guy who did stay reminded our boss that I 'm newly married , and that did it . " He took a deep breath , then went on : " ly boss and I worked on the plane and , finally , after about thirty calls to Caracas , when everything seemed to be improving , we had a couple of drinks . After we landed , we phoned Caracas again to get the latest update . Everything was fine by then , so we had a couple of drinks to celebrate . All this on my queasy , empty stomach . I fell asleep in the cab , coming home . I am so sorry- " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , okay . Maybe I overreacted . I was scared . " " You had every right to he scared . " He wrapped his arms around her . " I 'm going to take care of you , cherish you , and all that other stuff we promised . " He kissed her , and she kissed him back , and later , she gave him a guided tour of what was new in their apartment . By the time her casserole was defrosted and bubbling hot , she was hungry enough to sit down with him for dinner . He held till an unopened bottle of champagne and handed her a little card . " From my boss , " he said . " He bi ; ht it in the Caracas airport . " Toast your happiness , it read . Sorry to have kept Andy away from you for so long . She read it twice and finally glanced up at Andy . " We 'll stash it , " he said . " Or give it away . Whatever . " She laughed , walking toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those wedding vows ? " Open it . Your parents gave us gorgeous champagne flutes . If we 're going to toast our happiness properly , that 's what we need .
