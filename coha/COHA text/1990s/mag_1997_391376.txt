Why do European men make our otherwise rational national hearts race ? And will an international affair leave you feeling red , white , and very blue ? Cosmo did some cross-cultural checking to find out . By Nancy Miller // A European man wears a three-piece suit to the grocery store ; an American guy dons his high-school T-shirt to take you on your first dinner date . A European man can tell you which vineyard produces the best Bordeaux ; an American man can tell you whether his Bud is hot or cold . A European can say " I love you " in five languages , while an American man can tell you " I 'm not ready for a commitment " in just one . It 's no wonder that so many American women have been wooed and wowed by men who do n't like Big Macs , have never heard of Pamela Lee , and think Monday night means dinner and dancing , not pizza and football . Vive la Difference ! Europeans are renowned for approaching love like a meteor hurtling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for coffee , it 's quite a few steps away from a serious date . You 'll talk about safe subjects-your family , the weather , your job , " explains Tamika Young* , a 21-yearold native New Yorker who is now a business student living in Paris . " A European man will seek an immediate level of intimacy . He maintains eye contact ; he may take your hand-and this is before your drinks arrive . When you 're with a European guy , it 's just more intense . " Intensity seems to be the irresistible draw . " Europeans have no concept of the word date . They simply fall in love , " explains Raymonde Carroll , Ph.D. , a professor at Oberlin College in Oberlin , Ohio , and author of Cultural Misunderstandings : The French-American Experience ( University of Chicago Press , 1988 ) . " There is n't nearly as much selfpreservation in European relationships as in American ones , " says Carroll . " The idea is , Okay , maybe there will be trouble in the end , but to hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' Chelsea Hazlet , 25 , from Austin , Texas , who made her own French connection when she went overseas three years ago to restore a chateau , certainly enjoyed her trip . When she first met Laurent , another restorer , at the local cafe , she was too timid to ask him out . Time , however , was running out : " I was supposed to leave with my group the following day . That night , we had a party , and Laurent showed up . I knew it was now or never , so . I downed a glass of red wine and went for it . " Chelsea ditched her demure demeanor and asked Laurent to get together . What was supposed to he a scenic drive turned into a whirlwind trip through the country that lasted three days . " The group moved on , auld I stayed , " laughs Chelsea . In fact , she and Laurent are still in love and living in Paris . Like Chelsea , most American women abroad tend to be more romantically adventurous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the undeniable exotic curiosity of foreign men-and their un-American approach to dating and relating . " Europeans are much more open about things like sexuality and romance than men in the United States are , " which piques many American women 's interest , explains Carroll . Lucy Feldman , 29 , can attest to that . Three years ago , she left her hometown of San Francisco to pursue a lifelong dream of being an artist in Paris . Almost immediately upon arriving , she met Phillippe , also a painter The attraction was instant , and despite a language barrier ( Lucy 's remedial French and Phillippe 's virtually nonexistent English ) , it was love at first date . " We went to an art exhibition . Four days later , we took a two-week trip to Nice . Three weeks after that , we were living together , " remembers Lucy . " It was so spontaneous , so strange-something I would never have done with an American guy . But it all seemed so natural with Phillippe . " Risque Business While a foreign flame can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart ache . That 's the love lesson 26-year-old Debra Collins , an interpreter originally from San Diego , leamed when she found amore with Tito , her Italian exboyfriend , while they were both living in Prague : " We met in a nightclub and were immediately attracted to each other . He gave me a ride home , and we went out to dinner the next night . Before we even got to the main course , he told me he loved me . I wis shocked , to say the least . An American guy would never do that . But Tito had this passion that was so exciting and contagious . " Apparently . After six months of Tito 's relentless begging , Debra moved in with him . However , during their tumultuous two years together , the passion that Debra at first found so seductive proved to be fatal to their relationship . " Most Europeans are passionate in love and war , " Debra explains . " We fought and made love with the same intensity . It got tiring after a while . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prague , Debra decided to end things with Tito . But she remembers her Latin lover fondly : " Tito was a sensual , attentive man . And a perfect lover . That 's the way the Latin Europeans are . " Yes , there is a continental quality to their bedroom behavior that 's undeniably different from that of the average American Joe . " Europeans know the art of seduction from a very young age , " says Carroll . Kean Rey , 31 , a Spanish man who now lives in California , agrees . " European men believe in treating women well . It 's part of our development , " he claims . " American men talk about sex like it 's business : how much , how many , who with . I do n't like that . " Many women who 've had foreign affairs wholeheartedly agree . Lucy , who 's been in Paris with Phillippe for three years , confesses that she felt more like a prize than a partner when she was with her American exes . " I felt like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not something we enjoyed together-not at all like Phillippe , who is a generous lover with an insatiable appetite . " Culture Clash Sometimes , however , la vita is not so ( dolce . Getting involved with a European man poses problems that do n't occur with the all-American variety . Besides a language barrier , which can create obstacles for even the most smitten bicultural couple , chemistry and curiosity could be all that two people share . " They come together because it feels good , " explains Carroll , " but exoticism quickly dissipates when reality ultimately sets in . " Louise Bauman , 28 , a commodities trader in New York City , remembers some of the roadblocks she stumbled upon during the college semester she spent in Italy . " I dated a few Italians and had a blast . But I found myself always having to explain jokes and struggling to make conversation . " Sure , a European love affair sounds enticing , but often a torrid romance is better left is it is , an experience to learn from and not necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' real ' relationship with an American man , " says Louise , " someone who has similar reference points and can be there for me in the long run . " Infidelity is another reality of dating a European man . " There is an English term used to describe two people who are not faithful , " says Carroll . " It 's called a European relationship . " It 's far more acceptable for Europeans to stray . Cheating is not part of the marriage contract for most Americans , who , as Carroll claims , " emphasize trust as the most important part of a relationship . " Although Lucy believes Phillippe is faithful , she has seen many of her European friends go through the infidelity cycle . " The msm cheats , she finds out , she gets mad and dumps him . Three days later , they make up . " Should an American woman , then , expect her boyfriend to cheat ? Lucy remains optimistic : " I know there is no one else . We have agreed that if things stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tamika is more skeptical , claiming she much prefers down-to-earth American men and their approach . " I have a hard time taking these Euro guys seriously , " she explains . " One minute , they 're madly in love with you and ca n't live without you . Then you him your head , and they 're eyeballing every girl who walks dow%vii the street . American men may not leave you love notes and flowers on your doorstep , but once they decide they 're in love , it 's usually for real .
