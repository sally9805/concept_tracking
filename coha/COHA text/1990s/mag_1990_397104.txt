GOING DOWN IN STYLE <p> It seems as if only months ago they were calling you the J. P. Morgan of the Roaring ' 80s , a veritable financial messiah , the kind of guy who singlehandedly drove the takeover turbines of an entire decade . You were a little more humble than that , though . You thought of yourself as the Jose Canseco of mergers and acquisitions  --  a little flashy , maybe , but the guy the ballclub could count on to hit one out in the clutch . Then all of a sudden the league started acting as if you 'd been stealing the other teams ' signs ; like maybe you were out there with a corked bat or something . Like maybe , just maybe , you were using a little too much pine tar . <p> Too bad the boys at the SEC did n't buy your rationale that running those big turbines required a little grease . Or that a guy who had his ear to the ground was bound to pick up an reside rumble now and again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gordon Gekko ( by Scavullo , of course ) hanging on the wall of your corner office , the one with the view of the Hudson clear up to Lake Champlain . Whatever , now they 're talking about you like some kind of junk bond junkie . They even want to ban you for life , making you more like , say , the Pete Rose of high finance . And suddenly that pack of paparazzi clamoring for your photograph has taken on a decidedly lupine demeanor . <p> All the more reason to remain unflappably stylish and immaculately turned out when the media come snapping at your heels . The perfect attire to set off the drab courthouse steps at Foley Square , for instance , is this dashing yet elegant cashmere topcoat , scarf , and double-breasted , peaked-lapel suit , all from Giorgio Armani . FASHION FELON <p> You first suspected something was wrong that Monday morning when the intercom buzzed and Miss Schockley 's voice had an odd catch in it . There were these two gentlemen to see you and they were n't talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity 's sake , and right off you were thinking hostile take-over . Except when these guys barged in , they really did look hostile . You had n't seen that much hardware since the plumbers installed the personal Jacuzzi in your executive suite . Still , they were pros . They knew how to slip on the cuffs without scratching the finish off your Rolex . Then , heaven be praised , when those damned tabloid fotogs showed up ( just how the hell did they find out so fast , anyway ? ) at least you were wearing an elegant jacket and slacks from Ermenegildo Zegna , shirt by Haupt , and tie by Lorenzo Vega . And when you decided they 'd had enough fun , your favorite Levorato over-coat proved a tasteful way to signal an end to the hunt . LAUREN ORDER <p> On a cool , sunny autumn morning , you 'll want to be warm yet richly casual in a forest green cashmere turtleneck , grey topcoat , and flannel trousers , all from Polo by Ralph Lauren . Especially as you 're being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched this scene a hundred times on Hill Street Blues and L.A. Law , but you never understood why the cops had to put their hands on the poor slob 's head until it happened to you . Or what delicate balance is required to slide into the back seat of a sedan while wearing bracelets . Just be grateful they had the tact to send an unmarked car , or the guys from the mail room who happened to be strolling by on their lunch break would really have something to talk about . To be on the safe side , though , a pair of tortoiseshell wraparounds from Eye on New York are de rigueur . HOSTILE MAKEOVER <p> Booking a Boom : Time was when your executive secretary handled all your travel arrangements for you , but the boys in blue are no slouches when it comes to scaring up some last-minute accommodations . Of course , like any busy corporate Wunderkind , there 's still the inevitable paperwork to be shuffled through , and you 'll feel especially masterful in this classic three-piece chalk-stripe suit from Polo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer dressed for success , in his navy chalk-stripe suit , also from Ralph Lauren . <p> Prints of the City : This 'll teach you to refer to newspaper reporters as " ink-stained wretches . " Not that the most veteran muckraker could afford a pair of solid gold cufflinks like these $2,150 beauties from Temple St. Clair Cart . Let ' em wear onyx ! <p> White Collar Crime : Sad to say , Mr. Scavullo was n't available , but then you probably wo n't be hanging these portraits in the board room , anyway . Still in all , it 's nice that the return of the lapel vest came just in time for one of life 's little unexpected moments : is n't it almost kind of fun to slip off your jacket for a quick snap or two ? TRIAL AND TERROR <p> Even if you 're lucky enough to have the television cameras barred from the courtroom , you 'll still want to look your most earnest when the DA tries to portray you as some sort of overreaching financial lizard . Try this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 46 West , and maybe a Zegna tie . INSIDER BLUES <p> You found it hard at first to adjust to your new lifestyle . You even had a little trouble bribing the prison screws to do your laundry for you . And like insider trading , insider dressing required a radical redefinition of the rules of acceptable conduct and style . Bleak as the situation may seem for the moment , though , you can make the most of these rashly relaxed standards by getting comfy and casual in some Gap button-fly blue jeans , a nice blue denim shirt from Haupt , and , for that roguish finishing touch , a pair of cool blue nubuck shoes with feather-light soles , by Andrea Getty for Jandreani , ideal for a friendly get-together with other celebrity cons . Or for just hanging around , watching daytime TV and munching on junk food care packages while you mull over alternative careers outside the exciting fields of insider trading and junk bond financing . The electronic ankle bracelet you 'll be sporting can be a bit of a nuisance , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tap dancing .
