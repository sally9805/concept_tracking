<p> Babette pops her head out of the quiet pool with barely a ripple , her wet brown eyes peering at Jack Lawson to see if the marine scientist has brought her favorite dish - fresh fish . <p> He has n't . But the adult female harp seal remains motionless for close to a minute , listening as Dr. Lawson and a visitor chat about seal diet . <p> Bored , perhaps , Babette slides below the surface of the research tank a stone 's throw from the crashing Atlantic Ocean that is her true home . This is no trained seal . Barking and slapping flippers for dinner is n't something Babette or her associates Tyler , Victor , or Virgil will do . <p> These are wild harp seals , so named because of the harp-like markings on their backs . Canadian scientists like Lawson are studying harp seals here at the Ocean Sciences Centre of Memorial University to find out how much of each type of fish they eat . <p> The research is crucial because , dewy-eyed and cute though they may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million strong and growing - menace the revival of Canada 's once-rich , but now-depleted cod fisheries . <p> Harp seals are not responsible for wiping out the valuable cod and putting 40,000 fishermen out of work in Canada 's Atlantic provinces , many marine scientists say . The cod that once swam in vast schools were devastated by a decade of overfishing by Canadian and foreign trawler fleets , they say . <p> Yet harp seals may soon pay the price for this human excess . Within days the Canadian government will announce plans for the 1996 annual harp seal hunt off the coast of Newfoundland over the outcries of animal rights activists in Europe . <p> Earlier this year , Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin called for an expanded seal hunt in which the government would subsidize hunters by paying up to 20 cents per pound for seal meat . <p> Last year only 60,000 seals were killed out of 186,000 " total allowable catch " because of rugged ice conditions . This year 's hunters may enlist an icebreaker to reach more seals and kill up to 200,000 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sealing industry officials say . <p> " This government will work with the sealers and fishermen to rebuild a viable and expanded commercial seal hunt next year , " Mr. Tobin said at a June news conference in Newfoundland . <p> Harp seals , Tobin said , eat immature Atlantic cod that could , if left alone , revive Canada 's cod fishery much more quickly . They eat about 6.9 million tons of fish each year , he said . Only 3 percent of their diet is valuable Atlantic cod . But that still amounts to 140,000 tons of cod . <p> Harp seal herds are healthy and can stand hunters ' killing up to 287,000 per year without diminishing the population , marine scientists who study seals generally agree . But they also say there is no evidence to show that killing seals will hasten the return of the cod . <p> " People look at the numbers we 've produced and say , ' Wow , those seals are eating a lot of cod , ' " Lawson says . " But these biological systems are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be of killing a lot more seals . It might help the cod . But it also might not . " <p> Harp seals have been hunted commercially since the early 18th century . But Canada , under growing international pressure from animal rights groups , banned the killing of " white coat " pups in 1987 . The US had banned seal-product imports in 1972 and the European Union banned pelts from immature seals in 1983 . <p> Sealing was a C$ 16 million ( US$ 12 million ) a year industry before it collapsed in 1983 to its present C$ 1 million a year level . In Newfoundland , there are about 9,000 registered seal hunters , but only about one-third of them are active . Now the industry has gone on the offensive . <p> " These animal rights people come out and tell outright lies , " says Tina Fagan , the Canadian Sealer 's Association ( CSA ) executive director . " We do n't yell , scream , or shout anymore . But we 're determined to get out our side of the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With government help and a " change in public attitudes , " world markets for seal products are slowly growing , Ms. Fagan says . There is no interest , however , in hunting white-coat pups again , she says . <p> Critics , however , say the primary market for seals is not for seal meat or fur but for dried seal penises , coveted by practitioners of traditional Asian medicine for alleged healing properties . <p> The debate goes to the core of critics ' arguments against the hunt : Is there really a market for seal parts other than for the males ' reproductive organs ? <p> " If we 're going to kill seals , we 've got to be able to justify the use of the whole pelt , " says Bernard Martin , a fisherman based in Petty Harbor , south of St. John 's , Newfoundland . " I could n't buy into a slaughter of these animals just for the sake of slaughter , or just for the sake of the penises . " <p> The CSA 's Ms. Fagan denies that reproductive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is not the huge demand for them that critics claim . The industry , she says , is being maligned . <p> But Janet Russell , a former fisheries observer and environmental critic in St. John 's , says the Canadian government is propping up a dying industry with taxpayer subsidies because it is the politically smart thing to do in a province with a 19 percent unemployment rate . <p> " The government hears a lot from the public asking them to do something about seals , " she says . " They 're under a lot of pressure . " Also , she says , the seals are a " scapegoat " to deflect attention from government fishing policies that led to the cod collapse . <p> Tom Best , president of the Association of Newfoundland and Labrador Fisheries Cooperatives , which claims 4,000 members , says it 's just common sense that there are too many seals eating too many cod . <p> " I 've been fishing for 30 years , " Mr. Best says . " And I have seen the seals ' impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that the increasing harp seal population is not having an impact on cod . " <p> Such sentiments are widespread in Newfoundland , yet broad opposition to seal products in European Union countries continues . <p> " This will be a hunt for seal products that the rest of the world does n't want , " says Richard Moore , executive director of the London-based International Federation of Animal Welfare . In June , his group began a boycott of Canadian tinned salmon in Great Britain to protest an expanded and subsidized hunt . " It 's not commercially viable - that 's a fact . " <p> Tobin 's moves against the seals , Mr. Moore says , are to meet domestic political needs and are based on uncertain scientific data . <p> Back at the Ocean Sciences Center , where it 's finally feeding time , Lawson hand-feeds Babette a small piece of fish ( not cod ) . She snaps it back into and down her throat . In a year or so , he says , Babette and the others will be released to the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you kill seals despite the fact there is n't a market for all the meat or fur , and despite no evidence of an overall effect on the cod ? " he muses , tossing another tidbit to Babette . <p> " A number of people around here , seal processors , are saying ' I can sell all the seals you can sell me . ' But they 're not saying where they would sell them . "
