South Africa CRY THE BELOVED COUNTRY <p> South Africa 's democratic election in April 1994 was widely acclaimed as a marvel of our time . A country that eight years earlier many feared was on the edge of civil war negotiated a political compromise that transferred power from the white minority to the black majority . Majority rule will be implemented in two stages ; the current government of national unity , which gives all parties of significance a place , yields to unrestricted majority rule in 1999 . <p> Since the election , the once-feared threat of right-wing violence has faded . Although extremist Eugene Terre'blanche of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement still appears on his horse from time to time , most conservative Afrikaners accept the new government , which President Nelson Mandela has made easier for them by bending over backward to respond to white concerns . And in black communities there has been little evidence of populist factions in revolt against the compromises of the new government . <p> Unfortunately , economic progress has not matched this rosy political picture . The economy has turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still only about 3.5 percent . While that pace is a marked improvement over the early 1990s , when the economy contracted , it is not nearly enough to reduce staggeringly high black unemployment , estimated at 41 percent overall and higher among young people . Direct foreign investment has been slow . The new government is working hard to put its agenda for black social and economic uplift , called the Reconstruction and Development Program , in place , but the program is being criticized for slow delivery . South Africa has to break through the barriers of slow growth and high unemployment if democracy is to deliver the goods and secure long-term stability . <p> South Africa 's economic difficulties reflect a number of structural problems that only deep-rooted changes can correct . There is no political or economic consensus , however , on how to make those changes . Private sector growth is the only long-term solution for South Africa 's economic straits . But to generate the political capital necessary to pursue long-term growth , the government will have to combine economic liberalization with effective interventions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MUCH IS ASKED <p> Despite South Africa 's reputation for a well-run economy under white rule , the policies of the National Party hampered growth severely . Apartheid brought about international isolation and economic sanctions , but the government 's economic management was also poor . For all its criticisms of the ineptitude of African states under black rule to the north , the National Party followed policies after 1948 that resembled much of the rest of Africa . It developed massive bureaucratic and parastatal structures to provide public employment for Afrikaners , many of whom were poor in 1948 . It embraced strong protectionism and import substitution . It spent lavishly on public investments , especially defense and supposedly strategic industries . And it set up puppet regimes in the so-called homelands it established that had all the elements of bad governance that the National Party criticized : autocracy , patronage , corruption , and enormous budget deficits . <p> These policies did not have the same catastrophic effects as in other countries , partly because South Africa was trying to subsidize only 15 percent of the population and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did limit growth . After steady gains in per capita income from 1946 to 1974 , income stagnated from 1974 to 1981 and fell by 20 percent from 1981 to 1994 . Today South Africa 's per capita income of $2,700 is practically what it was in the mid-1960s . <p> One of the main reasons for falling growth was a serious decline in savings and investment . Net domestic investment dropped to less than 5 percent of GDP in the 1990s from an average of 16 percent in the 1970s . A longer-term problem was falling productivity . Much investment occurred in the wrong places : in parastatals rather than the private sector , in mining and agriculture rather than manufacturing , and in capital investment rather than training . Competitiveness fell and protectionism prevented international competition from imposing corrections . Political unrest after 1976 and growing government deficits after 1983 further drained output . Examining South Africa 's growth record since 1970 , a 1993 World Bank study concluded that " such low growth is highly unusual . . . . The closest parallel is with Latin American countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . " <p> Past policies have left a number of structural weaknesses . Rates of savings and investment are meager . Investment is capital-intensive and creates few jobs . Productivity is weak ; Mexican auto workers , for example , are three times as productive as South African auto workers . Competitiveness is low  --  South Africa ranked 42nd out of 48 in a recent report . The skill levels of the work force are low , and a large proportion of state spending is concentrated in civil service salaries . Taxes are high , but black education , health , and infrastructure are severely underdeveloped . These are serious problems , and until they are corrected they will continue to constrain growth and employment . <p> This reality has been obscured by the euphoria that followed the 1994 elections and by upturns in the economy based on increased private investment , especially in manufacturing , and an inflow of foreign capital . After 12 years of economic decline , these gains have been greeted with understandable enthusiasm , but they must be put in perspective . Current annual growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black unemployment ; World Bank economists estimate growth of 4.25 percent is required . Most foreign investment has been portfolio rather than direct investment , and total private investment is still low in absolute terms . Most of the beneficiaries of higher growth have been white South Africans and the small black middle class . The person in the street has seen little change . <p> To make real progress in raising black living standards , South Africa needs higher growth , at least five to six percent a year , and it must be more employment-intensive . To achieve this the new government will have to address South Africa 's structural weaknesses and expand foreign investment and trade . In this effort it faces a series of dilemmas . It knows it must attract domestic and foreign investment , but business confidence is hard to earn . It knows it must liberalize trade , but lowering barriers risks severe dislocations since South Africa 's many uncompetitive industries will suffer . It wants to spend more on black social needs , but taxes and government spending are already high . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can not hire more civil servants or force the private sector to make labor-intensive investments . A WINDOW FOR PROGRESS <p> Growth is inevitably a long-term process for which a government has to create the right conditions . The government 's ability to create those conditions will depend on the patience of black South Africans . The conventional wisdom is that after years of deprivation under apartheid the black majority will put enormous pressure on the new government to produce rapid gains in jobs , housing , and education , which could push the government toward a counterproductive populism . Some evidence supports this view  --  in a common anecdote a man is waiting for the government to " give me my house . " But there are also reasons to question predictions of overwhelming black expectations . Intensive studies of black opinion since the election show a surprising patience and realism . Most people seem to understand that change can not come overnight . In addition , the closest historical parallel  --  the political transition in Zimbabwe in 1980  --  does not support the overwhelming expectations view . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not face overwhelming demands for economic payoffs . Most people felt that the political goal of majority rule had been achieved , and they recognized that economic progress would take time . <p> Black expectations may not overwhelm the South African government in the near term as long as the disadvantaged see some tangible changes occurring and have a realistic hope for a better life for their children , which opinion polls indicate is particularly important . The risk is greater in the medium to long term , particularly if progress in expanding black employment and participation in the private sector is disappointing . Fourteen years after its change , Zimbabwe is seeing a black backlash against white domination of the economy , fueled by economic stagnation , lack of jobs , and lack of black ownership . This backlash has occurred even though the Zimbabwean government succeeded in raising social welfare , particularly in education , and increasing black employment in the public sector . Zimbabwe 's experience shows the limits of statism as a method to uplift a disadvantaged majority . <p> In South Africa the government has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disadvantaged . This progress can not consist only , or even primarily , of benefits provided by the state . Rather , it must be based on economic growth and private sector development . The feat in South Africa will be finding ways to advance the majority population durably through economic growth , private sector jobs , and black ownership  --  what Zimbabwe failed to accomplish . The challenge for the government is to keep the focus on long-term growth but provide enough benefits to the majority population along the way that political consensus can be maintained and moral commitments protected . NEITHER TIGER NOR TORTOISE <p> In its first year in office the new government focused on implementing its Reconstruction and Development Program rather than economic overhaul . Last July President Mandela announced a new emphasis on economic growth to be managed by a council that includes key politicians  --  Deputy President Thabo Mbeki , Deputy President F. W. de Klerk , and Minister of Home Affairs Mangosuthu Buthelezi  --  as well as leading economic ministers . Commentators cited the Asian tigers as models of the kind of rapid growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Looking to the high-growth countries of Asia shows a healthy self-confidence and hope for the future . If it signifies a political commitment to growth and employment creation as the main vehicles for social mobility , it increases the chances the latter will eventually be achieved . To aspire to East Asian levels of performance , however , is to reveal how far South Africa has to go . The country is starting from a base that is inconsistent with elements of Asian success . According to the World Bank , the most important factors in the growth rates of the Asian success stories have been high levels of investment in physical capital and education , especially private investment and primary and secondary education . Investment accounted for two-thirds of the growth in these countries overall , 87 percent in Malaysia . South Africa is at the other end of the spectrum . Its savings rate is less than 18 percent of GDP , compared to East Asia 's 35 percent . As noted earlier , its net domestic investment is less than 5 percent of GDP , and mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements are missing . East Asia has single-mindedly focused on exports , especially manufacturing exports , based initially on low-cost labor and later on skilled labor . But South Africa 's exports are mainly commodities . Many of its companies are geared to import substitution , and its manufacturing productivity is below international norms . It is not a low-wage producer , it has a skilled labor shortage , and its advanced sectors are heavily unionized . Industrial and agricultural development have been strongly linked to employment creation in East Asia , but not in South Africa . Strong internal competition among firms and good technocratic capacity in government have been lacking in South Africa , and macroeconomic stability may be hard to maintain . <p> Like South Africa , Malaysia in the early 1970s was divided between an ethnic economic elite the Chinese  --  and a disadvantaged majority population , the Bumiputra . Malaysia used the power of government to help the Bumiputra through public employment , expansion of parastatals , and government-funded education . However , the greatest gains for its disadvantaged population came through sustained growth fueled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strong exports , and low-cost labor , as well as the entrepreneurial skills of many members of its Chinese population . In reaction to global economic problems in the 1980s , Malaysia liberalized its economic policies and undertook some privatization , which has led to growth of 8 percent a year or higher . Many Bumiputra are now moving out of government and into the private sector . <p> Malaysia shows that an unequal society can lift up a disadvantaged population and reduce poverty in a generation if it can combine effective government programs with high growth . South Africa will probably promote social uplift by similar means . The question is whether it will be as successful , or even close to as successful , in achieving sustained growth . <p> This is not to say that South Africa should not aspire to East Asian success in the long run . But given the very different starting points , East Asia is not likely to be a helpful guide for near-term reform . For that purpose , Latin America may be better because it faced many of the obstacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orientation , low productivity , large public and parastatal sectors , high unemployment , and high inequaltity . Latin America tried to reverse chronic stagnation and inflation by orthodox stabilization and liberalization : government cutbacks and deregulation , privatization , and trade liberalization . Chile pioneered radical liberalization starting in the mid-1970s after Salvador Allende 's rule , with impressive results in growth , trade , and living standards . Mexico , Argentina , Peru , and other Latin countries began liberalizing reforms in the early 1990s with more mixed results . Many were rewarded with substantial increases in foreign investment , but these were reversed after the collapse of the Mexican peso in 1994 . Even before the peso fell , growth averaged only 3.1 percent in Latin America as a whole . Export expansion was mainly within the region . The underlying weaknesses of low savings , poor international competitiveness , high inequality , and ineffectual public institutions changed little . In post-mortems on the Latin crisis in the July/August 1995 issue of Foreign Affairs , Paul Krugman and Moises Naim noted the failure of liberalization to address these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning to expect liberalization alone to produce rapid growth and development . <p> Foreign models of development have a double-edged implication for South Africa . On the one hand they suggest that South Africa has to liberalize if it is to have a chance of attracting foreign capital and increasing productivity , growth , and trade . South Africa 's competitors in Eastern Europe , Southeast Asia , and Latin America are already well along this path . On the other hand , foreign models also imply that liberalization is not likely to bring quick gains ; Latin experience suggests that liberalization often worsens poverty in the short run . The only way around this conundrum is to make industry and agriculture more employment-intensive in the near term , along Asian lines . <p> This situation is at odds with the political and moral pressures on the government to deliver tangible benefits . Apartheid discredited capitalism for black South Africans by identifying it with white dominance . In such circumstances it is not politically realistic to expect the new government to focus exclusively on growth and private sector development . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve black welfare through social programs , affirmative action , and changes in the economy to increase black employment and ownership . The government must pursue these efforts with enough vigor and competence to show the majority its commitment to black uplift , even if their needs can not be satisfied in the near term . MANDELA 'S CAUTION <p> Faced with demanding economic and social problems , the new government has avoided populist temptations and worked to encourage private investment . It has not , like Zimbabwe , massively expanded the civil service to provide jobs for supporters or boosted social spending to unsustainable levels . In fact , its first post-apartheid budget deficit was smaller than the last of the preceding National Party government , although still large at 5.8 percent of GDP . The government is also trying to move South Africa into the global economy encouraging foreign investment , abolishing the dual exchange rate , and liberalizing trade to meet the requirements of the World Trade Organization . <p> These policies are not what many predicted based on the daunting legacies of apartheid and the African National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under the pressures of governance , the new leadership has emphasized ideological moderation , the limits of state intervention , and the need to rely on the private sector and foreign investment as the main engines of growth . This thinking is internally led . The new government is determined to steer its own ship in economic affairs , avoiding the dependence on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank that it sees in the rest of Africa . It wants trade and investment , not long-term aid . <p> The government 's approach to black uplift in the Reconstruction and Development Program has also been moderate . It stresses redirection of government programs rather than new spending . A special fund set up to help redirect spending was given $700 million in its first year out of a total GDP of some $115 billion . In spite of enormous social needs , government expenditures on black education , health , and other areas have been increased at a deliberate pace . Hampered by government bureaucracies that have little experience with grassroots development and by ineffective administrations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of its programs . It has also encouraged community involvement in development activities despite the time it takes . <p> The general picture is one of a new government trying to do the right things . Some of the credit goes to President Mandela , a hero who has set a tone with his leadership that permeates the government . But the new policies are not a one-man show and are led by a collection of influential ministers and senior officials who agree on basic principles . Many of these people came from the trade unions , the South African Communist Party , and other militant backgrounds , which gives the new policies a degree of credibility with important constituencies . <p> Nevertheless , in the economic sphere , the new government has been more successful at avoiding mistakes than at charting a new path . Government recognition of the perils of deficit spending and inflation has laid a foundation for future growth , but the government has not yet put forward a program for increasing investment , improving productivity , and expanding exports and jobs . A MIXED PATH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to pursue liberalization . This means holding down government spending , reducing its massive bureaucratic structures , and beginning to dismantle extensive trade protections . However , liberalization will do little to help the black majority in the short term and should be supplemented by other measures to help the disadvantaged . First best economic prescriptions must be tempered by political constraints . Holding down government spending is desirable but conflicts with political imperatives to expand social services for black communities , upgrade township infrastructure , raise the pay of police , nurses , and teachers , and fund programs such as land reform . Spending can not be contained by cutting services to whites precipitately because that would encourage white flight and endanger social cohesion . The only answer is to find new ways to finance government spending . <p> One possible solution is privatization . South Africa 's publicly owned and parastatal assets are substantial , by one estimate accounting for 52 percent of the country 's capital stock . While economists are wary of using privatization to solve fiscal problems , in South Africa it would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fund one-time social investments during this critical period . Moreover , there are strong efficiency arguments for privatization . While recent commercialization efforts have brought some improvements in parastatal efficiency , on the whole the sector remains a bastion of Afrikaner employment , a fiscal drag , and a damper on productivity and competitiveness . Privatization can raise productivity through sales to local and foreign investors who will bring capital , new technology , and better management . A focus on areas where productivity gains can enhance long-term growth and use of the proceeds to boost development should be the core of a privatization strategy . In other areas , privatization can expand black ownership of capital through voucher schemes or other methods of distributing ownership shares to the population . Unfortunately , the labor unions , which fear job losses and have recently threatened strikes , have hamstrung all privatization options . In this field the government can not afford to bow to an interest group , even one that played an important role in an anti-apartheid struggle . The interests of the unions are at odds with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . <p> Trade liberalization also requires balance . Reducing protections over the long term is imperative , but quick liberalization is not . Rapid liberalization in a protected and uncompetitive economy like South Africa 's would result in severe dislocations . It would be better to lead with focused changes that can bring some export payoffs , such as export processing zones and duty rebates to insulate exporters from the costs of protectionism , while phasing in broader liberalization . <p> Liberalization should be accompanied by special intitiatives to boost growth and employment . Private sector job creation has to be a priority . This means not only new investment , but more labor-intensive investment . The capital intensity of South Africa 's industrial and agricultural sectors is not going to change quickly , but strong incentives have to be put in place to direct new investment to job creation . Current government subsidies to capital-intensive mineral industries should be redirected to small business development , which will create jobs . Labor market reform is also needed . South Africa has one of the most centralized labor negotiation systems and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . These characteristics hurt international competitiveness , formal sector employment , and small business development . The power of the unions , which represent only 17 percent of the economically active population , has to be reduced for the sake of expanding employment . Finally , a key to long-term employment creation is better education , especially primary and secondary education . Deliberate undereducation of the black population was one of the most economically irrational aspects of apartheid . While all social needs appear pressing in the Reconstruction and Development Program , basic education has the most direct link to future growth and employment and should be favored in allocating scarce government resources . <p> There are no quick routes to higher growth , as Latin American development demonstrates . However , one step is increasing savings and investment . In the early 1980s Chile privatized its social security system , shifting from a government-funded pay-as-you-go system to a scheme of mandatory contributions to private pension funds , which invested in Chile 's capital markets . This plan removed the cost of social security from the budget and dramatically boosted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to South Africa , " Chile 's economic success is linked to its high savings rate , which is in turn largely attributable to the pension scheme . " If South Africa were to follow a similar course , it might increase savings and investment significantly , with major benefits for growth . OF THOSE GIVEN MUCH , MUCH IS ASKED <p> Developing and building political support for an economic reform program will not be easy . South African politics are not conducive to radical reform . The country is not emerging from the sort of economic catastrophe often required to produce political commitment to deep reform , and the recent economic upturn has made structural changes seem less urgent . Moreover , South Africa lacks interest groups or parties that combine a strong interest in economic reform with political clout . The ANC has political power , but its incentives for economic reform are mixed . Its first goal is to empower and uplift those hurt by apartheid  --  a distributional goal that fits poorly with economic liberalization , which in the short run benefits the better educated , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and parties have not been effective advocates of reform . The business community has offered few ideas of its own and has resisted many changes proposed by the government , notably policies to increase competition . Labor unions have defined their interests narrowly . Many other political parties have been content to stand on the sidelines and call for free market changes without acknowledging that most of their proposals would entrench white privilege . No major party has come forward with a broad platform for combining black uplift with private sector-led growth . <p> In one version of South Africa 's future , the most important actors remain locked in narrow conceptions of individual self-interest , and the country as a whole is consigned to slow growth . This outcome will create pressure for government redistribution and endanger racial cohesion over the long term . But in another version , those actors participate in a positive-sum game , agreeing to take exceptional steps or make exceptional sacrifices for the broader good in return for similar concessions from others . Only the route of mutual sacrifice will lead to higher growth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership , which can not come entirely from the government . The ANC-led government has a major role to play , but it is unrealistic to expect the ANC to lead a liberalization thrust by itself . The business community , the unions , and other political parties will have to cooperate . Those who hold the best economic cards  --  the business community and the white population in general must be willing to make contributions proportional to their economic strength . The historical National Party goal of Afrikaner uplift has been achieved . The business community and whites in general prospered under National Party policies , even as those policies sapped growth and structurally weakened the economy . These groups must now take special responsibility . As the proverb says , " Of those to whom much has been given , much will be asked . " For reform to work , not just economically but also politically , this will be necessary . <p> If South Africa were a " normal " country , one could not expect this kind of joint leadership to be forthcoming . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged from a history of tragedy to become a model of compromise and creative leadership for the world . Those qualities give special hope that the new challenges of growth and development will be met . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> By R. Stephen Brent <p> <p> R.
