Every month I receive a dozen or so fan letters from youngsters telling me how much they love my books and requesting that I answer a few questions for them . I must say that it is gratifying to find so many youngsters with such a keen interest in tine literature that they would go to all the trouble of writing their favorite author . Here is a typical example : Dear Pat : You are my favorite author and my teacher gave us this assignment to write a letter to our favorite author and then write a report on him and if you do n't reply to this letter I get an F on the assignment . So please answer the 337 questions I have submitted with this letter . I would appreciate it if you would type your reply double-space with one-inch margins but allow enough room at the top of the page for me to add a title , my name , and a couple of comments of my own on my report . Please send your reply by one-day mail , as my assignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted fan , Donald PS . As soon as I get an answer to my letter , I promise that I will actually read one of your books , and I mean that sincerely . Here is my typical reply : Dear Donald : Thank you very much for the nice letter . I was pleased to learn that I am your favorite author . Because I must spend most of my time hunting and fishing and generally having a lot of fun  --  and no longer must attend school like you , ha ha !  --  and also because of your pressing deadline , I can answer only a few of your questions . Here goes : Question 14 : How old are you ? Answer : Age 37 . Question 22 : Are your stories true or do you make them up ? Answer : They are all true . One of my principles is never to tell lies . Lying is a disgusting habit and one that I hope you will avoid . If I may be so bold as to say so , Donald , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after my own , one of integrity , high principle , temperance in all things , and rigid adherence to the unvarnished truth . Question 41 : I think the funniest story you ever wrote is " Grandma and the Buck Deer . " Is that one of your favorites too ? Answer : No , it is not ! I think it is a stupid and disgusting story and certainly does not deserve the literary reputation and acclaim that it has earned over the years , and I would hold to that opinion even if I had written that story instead of an author by the name of Joel Vance . A great many people have written over the years to congratulate me on my having authored " Grandma and the Buck Deer , " which goes to show the dismal state into which literary taste in this country has fallen . I must tell you , Donald , that there is no story ever written that I have grown to detest more . Question 63 : What kind of gun do you use for hunting grizzly bears ? Answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot back over my shoulder while moving at a fast pace . I must admit that I do n't hunt grizzlies anymore , now that I have given up the bow and arrow . I only wish grizzlies would regard our relationship the same way I do  --  neither of us hunts the other . A grizzly lives on the mountain where I do my daily hiking . I refuse to allow a mere grizzly to dictate where I can or can not hike , although I am open to any suggestions he might care to make . On a couple of occasions a gray stump has reared up out of the brush and propelled me into the upper branches of a pine tree for a better view of it . Gray stumps can be deadly , particularly during twilight , and every year they are responsible for a number of heart failures in grizzly country . Question 154 : Do you like  --  yuck !  --  girls ? Answer : What a strange question ! It was once popular with Army psychiatrists but is unexpected from a boy your age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your age , or perhaps a little younger , my view of girls was basically that they occupied space that might be better used for something else , like potted plants . As I grew older , however , I became increasingly fond of them , until at last I wandered into that vast wilderness that is love and have been lost in it ever since . If only I 'd had the good sense to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find my way out ! Question 189 : Have you ever had an out-of-body experience ? Answer : Yes , I have , Donald . One day I was studying a piece of rock in my hand . It seemed familiar . Then I realized it was the very same rock that was supposed to be holding me to the side of a cliff . As I plummeted toward the ground below , my whole life flashed before my eyes , which I took to be a bad omen , even if it was a rerun . I do n't remember hitting the ground , but a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and becoming lighter and lighter and then floating up into the air . At first , I thought it might merely be a result of the green hash we 'd eaten for breakfast that morning . But then I looked down and there were my fishing companions Retch Sweeney and Al Finley crouched over a flattened , prostrate figure more or less shaped like a gingerbread man . And it was ME ! Gave me a bit of a start , I can tell you that , Donald . It was the first time my body and I had ever been separated . Then I heard Al say , " I think we 've lost him , Retch , " and Retch nodded sadly . " No ! " I yelled down at them . " I 'm not lost yet ! Look up here , you fools ! " But they did n't seem to hear me . Then Retch became all panicky and started yelling almost hysterically . As I recall , he was yelling that if he and Al did n't stop fooling around and hurry up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly , I felt very angry , possibly because Retch and Al were arguing over how to divide up my gear , and all at once I was sucked back into my body , which was pretty darn glad to see me , too . Question 204 : What 's the biggest fish you 've ever caught ? Answer : About this big , Donald . Maybe even a little bigger . Question 205 : What 's the biggest elk you 've ever shot. ? Answer : About this big , Donald . Maybe even a little bigger . Question 243 : What is the ideal hunting vehicle ? Answer : Any vehicle belonging to someone else . Question 267 : What is the ideal outdoor companion ? Answer : An excellent question , Donald ! This is why it is so important to select your friends carefully . Always avoid relationships with individuals who display any sort of habit unacceptable in polite society , unless , of course , they happen to own a late-model hunting vehicle . Some individuals are so gross , however , that even their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that case , one should avoid associating with them no matter what they might own , the one exception being a fine hunting dog . Anyone who owns a fine hunting dog ca n't be all that bad . I should point out here that my friend Retch Sweeney owns both a good hunting vehicle and a fine hunting dog , just in case you were wondering , Donald . Question 273 : How long have you been writing professionally ? Answer : Almost exactly 40 years . You may detect a minor disparity between the number of years I 've been writing and my age as given above . So ? Question 285 : Why did you become a writer ? Answer : I am frequently asked that same question , Donald , usually by my wife , Bun . It is impossible here to indicate the exact tone of voice in which Bun asks the question , but it is such that I am fairly certain she does not merely wish to satisfy her curiosity . Basically , the answer is , it was either that or go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It merely seems to be easy to the outside observer . For example , I may be down at Kelly 's Bar &; Grill shooting a few games of pool and smoking a cigar and laughing and joking with the guys , but the truth is , I 'm really hard at work writing . Inside my brain , where writing actually takes place , I 'm just this churning caldron of work , with my brain gasping and wheezing and sweating and crying out from its incredible exertion . But then when I go home and flop down in front of the television to give my brain a little rest , you would be surprised how difficult it is to explain to my spouse that I have n't been frittering away an afternoon in a sleazy pool hall . So writing is not an easy life , Donald , no indeed . Question 300 : Do you have to be extremely intelligent to be a writer ? Answer : Yes . Also , you need to be extremely well educated . I myself spent nine years at the university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , some of my professors took to referring to me as " McManus the Sophomore . " At the time , there were still jobs available for English majors , but two of my classmates got hired for them . So there was nothing left for me to do but go into writing . If you decide to become an English major , Donald , always abbreviate it as " Eng . " That way your parents might think you are majoring in engineering and will one day amount to something and that they are n't throwing their money away to help you become one of the few people in the world who can distinguish a gerund from a participle . Question 310 : Have you ever been lost ? Answer : " Lost " is a relative term , Donald . If you are asking whether search-and-rescue parties have combed the mountains looking for me , the answer is yes . If you are asking if I have ever taken a shortcut over a mountain pass in Montana and ended up knocking on a door in a small town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are asking if I 've ever been actually lost , the answer is no . The truth is , I have a superb sense of direction , even to the extent of proving compasses wrong . Question 318 : Do sporting-goods manufacturers send you all kinds of neat equipment free so that you can test it and promote it for them on television ? Answer : No , they do n't . It is true that most other outdoor writers get a lot of neat free stuff to test , but not me . Even when a manufacturer hears that I 've bought a piece of his equipment , a representative will show up and try to buy it back from me , often at double what I paid for it ! Sporting-goods manufacturers have absolutely no regard for my feelings . Well , Donald , that is all the time I have for answering your questions . Now I must get busy and write another column for OUTDOOR LIFE , provided that the board of health has n't shut down Kelly 's Bar &; Grill yet again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
