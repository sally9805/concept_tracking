Although they operate in different media , TIME and CBS News have something in common : each institution has made its mark on the way news has been gathered and presented in this century . So when TIME embarked on its project of selecting the 100 Most Influential People of the Century , it was fitting that CBS News join us in producing a companion television series . The TIME 100 will be presented in six special issues and on six CBS News programs over the next two years . <P> The first installment of this joint venture , Leaders and Revolutionaries , will appear on newsstands on April 6  --  and on TV screens at 10 o'clock E.T . that evening , when CBS airs its first special . Other segments include Artists and Entertainers ; Builders and Titans ; Scientists and Thinkers ; Heroes and Inspirations ; and , finally , Person of the Century . <P> For CBS ' production team , mining the network 's vast trove of archival footage was both daunting and eye opening . In their eight months on the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footage and done no small amount of globe trotting to chase down rare material , including whimsical portraits of world leaders captured in home movies . Where television footage did not exist , they consulted the 70-year-old CBS radio archive , the National Archives , the Library of Congress and even the archives of foreign governments , such as those of Germany and China . Finally , CBS caught up with some of the individuals themselves , met with family members and landed guest essayists  --  including President and Mrs. Clinton  --  to discuss the great leaders and revolutionaries who have shaped their lives . <P> Viewers will not be looking at a conventional broadcast news set . Instead , CBS News anchor Dan Rather will walk through a computer-generated gallery of some of the century 's most luminous and unforgettable faces . " We 're using 21st century technology to sum up the 20th century , " says Andrew Heyward , president of CBS News . Strolling about electronically among those famous names was thought provoking , says Rather : " Watching the program , participating in discussions and trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've had a rare opportunity to reflect on what 's important to me in a leader , what actions and qualities I consider truly influential , meaningful and historic . " <P> We invite you to join us in that experience on April 6.
