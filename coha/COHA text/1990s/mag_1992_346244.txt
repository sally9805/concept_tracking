THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE NO SECRET of its antipathy toward the Endangered Species Act and its most celebrated case , the northern spotted owl . Environmentalists have used the owl as a stalking horse to save the last 10% of old-growth forest in the Northwest ; loggers claim that protecting it costs them 32,000 jobs . Last week the rare birds trembled , after the Cabinet-level committee known as the God Squad voted to override the act and allow timber sales on 1,700 acres . <P> Such an exemption has been granted only once before in the act 's 19-year existence . While environmentalists go to court to reverse the action , conservation legislation is winding its way through Congress to protect not only the owl also but the salmon , steelhead and other species dependent on the old-growth-forest ecosystems . Lawmakers also hope to help timber communities and retrain lumberjacks , many of whom will lose their jobs anyway when the last , irreplaceable trees fall .
