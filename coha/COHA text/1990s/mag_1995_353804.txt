Compared with Edward Robb Ellis , Samuel Pepys was a man of few words . In the nine years ( 1660-69 ) covered by his famous diary , Pepys produced about 1,250,000 words . That would be a mere warm-up lap for Ellis . In 67 years of recording his life and era , he has filled 35,000 or so pages with more than 20 million words , thereby gaining entry to the Guinness Book of World Records as author of the world 's largest diary . <P> Not to mention one of the best  --  and most idiosyncratic . Columnist Pete Hamill , in a glowing introduction to the first volume of excerpts from this work in progress , called A Diary of the Century ( Kodansha ; 578 pages ; $25 ) , proposes , " There are human beings not yet born who will be helped in understanding our times through the diaries of Edward Robb Ellis . " Far more than a personal memoir , the diaries record practically everything Ellis said , did , thought , felt , read or saw , accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters he sent and received . This glorious mishmash constitutes an informal history of 20th century America by an inquisitive writer who interviewed everyone from Harry Truman to Irving Berlin to 50-cent whores in the slums of New Orleans . Ellis has willed his diaries to New York University ; some professional historians regard them as a national treasure . <P> So who is Eddie Ellis , and why has he been writing this humongous saga ? A onetime newspaper and wire-service reporter , Ellis , 84 , has lived for the past 28 years in a book-crammed ( 15,000 volumes ) walk-up apartment in Manhattan 's Chelsea district . Slowed by age and emphysema , he rarely ventures from home but is still full of vim and spunk ; he spends an hour or more each day adding to the diaries , typing on an old Hermes manual . <P> The diaries began as a dare . As a 17-year-old high school sophomore in his hometown of Kewanee , Illinois , Ellis tried to enliven a cold , dull winter by proposing a contest to see which student could keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks , another after three months . Ellis , like the Energizer Bunny , kept on going . And going . <P> From the age of 14 he wanted to be a reporter and writer . He entered the University of Missouri , flunked out as a sophomore but returned to earn his degree in journalism in 1934 . Two months later , he got his first full-time job , in the New Orleans bureau of the Associated Press . The pay : $25 a week . <P> Even in the diaries ' early entries , the virtues and defects of this lifelong enterprise are apparent . Ellis has always been candid about his own weaknesses  --  among other things , he was a troubled binge drinker . His plain Joe prose is enlivened by boundless curiosity , a wry sense of humor and a falcon-sharp eye for detail . At a hearing conducted by red-hunting Senator Joseph McCarthy , for example , Ellis observed : " McCarthy has the slim hips of an athlete , a thick trunk and shoulders like a buffalo . Almost lacking a neck , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is long and thin , like a knife-gash in a melon. "
