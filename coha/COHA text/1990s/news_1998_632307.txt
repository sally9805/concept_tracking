<p> Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox are hoping that their newest collaboration  --  the $ 200 million movie , " Titanic "  --  will be as " unsinkable " as one of the movie 's real-life characters  --  Margaret " Molly " Brown . <p> Indeed , Molly Brown boarded that luxurious liner in 1912 for its maiden  --  and only  --  voyage and lived to tell about it . In fact , it made her a celebrity . <p> But what price fame ? Because of a popular 1960s film ( based on a Meredith Willson Broadway musical ) titled " The Unsinkable Molly Brown , " nearly everyone has heard of Denver 's rags-to-riches , socialite diva . Unfortunately , what they know about her is either dead wrong or so exaggerated as to constitute fiction . <p> The half-hour tour of Molly 's Queen Anne home on Denver 's once-fashionable Pennsylvania Street reveals a less cartoonish character . <p> " We try to separate the very interesting Mrs. Brown from the legend created about her life for the Broadway stage , " says Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is owned and operated by Historic Denver Inc . During tours , costumed docents chat with history-seekers as they tour a dozen rooms . <p> First of all , her name was never Molly . She was Mrs. Margaret Tobin Brown , thank you very much  --  Maggie to those who knew her well . Second , her husband , James Joseph ( " J.J. " ) Brown was not an ignorant prospector . He was a clever engineer whose invention of a better method of hard-rock mining so impressed the owners of the Little Johnny mine  --  which J.J. supervised  --  that they gave him a one-eighth share of the proceeds ; a fortune that swelled to an estimated $ 3 million to $ 7 million . <p> Further , Maggie was never so utterly rejected by Denver society as the " Unsinkable " movie and musical portray her to be . After all , many of the " Sacred 36 " social circle who dismissed Molly as an upstart were only one generation away from the mines themselves . But she never was quite accepted either , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devout Catholicism ) and her politics ( she was a mineowner who supported mine workers during Colorado 's often deadly labor disputes ) as it did her dirt-poor , mining-camp background . <p> Indeed , Maggie 's is a rags-to-riches story . Born in Missouri in 1867 to a ditch-digging , Irish immigrant father , Maggie followed one of her five brothers west to gold-crazy Leadville , Colo . Historians surmise she could read , write and do figures because she was a salesclerk  --  rugs and draperies  --  in the Daniels and Fisher Dry Goods store there . She and J.J. met and married in 1892 , struck gold in 1893 and de-camped to the Denver house in 1894 . They were a couple on the move . <p> Just how aspiring they  --  at least Maggie  --  were is evidenced as soon as visitors catch sight of the house . Like Mrs. Brown herself , the home is a standout : a three-story , stone-walled Victorian extravaganza trimmed out in balconies , porches , gables and high-falutin shingle-work . <p> The entry flaunts all the symbols of the well-to-do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an upholstered and canopied bench for visitors to sit on by the carved-wood fireplace . Gold-leafed , heavily textured wallpaper ascends to deep ceiling moldings . A painted statue ( yes , it 's of a black man in turban and baggy trousers ) holds aloft both a lamp and a calling-card tray . <p> Here guests waited to be taken into the parlor , itself lavishly upholstered in red silk wallcovering , plaster ceiling and hardwood floors . A polar bear rug smiles up at visitors who pause while the guide reports the " parable of the party . " <p> In " Unsinkable , " Molly ( Debbie Reynolds ) is depicted as hosting a party where no one comes . Actually , Maggie invited 800 locals to attend a soiree at her newly decorated house one summer afternoon  --  500 showed up . Hardly a heart-breaking rejection . <p> And it was quite the affair . Maggie had one orchestra greet visitors from the upstairs balcony and another serenade them in the backyard . Carpets lay on the grass so ladies ' slippers would n't get dirty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walker says as she leads the small group into the library , lined with glass-enclosed bookcases and opening onto a large bow-window . " After she became rich , she hired tutors to teach her French , Italian , German and Latin . This room was used by her and the children to read , play games and study . " <p> The dining room right behind is more formal ; sterling , crystal and china weigh down sideboards and the dining table almost groans under the weight of food spread out . " Victorians ate many more courses than we do now , " instructs Walker as she points out a photograph of Mrs. Brown . " She was a tall woman for her day , " Walker continues , " 5-foot-8 or so and very proud of her small feet and hands . " Indeed , she is posing them to catch the viewers ' eyes , but the gold-tipped cane and feathers in her hair attract glances just as well . <p> Upstairs are the private rooms . Each is a sumptuously furnished period knockout : daughter Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest green with wicker rocker and day bed , J.J. 's in masculine earthtones and wood . Maggie and J.J. did n't have a happy marriage . " J.J. was a philanderer , " Walker states bluntly . And Maggie herself was controlling and ambitious . They separated in 1909 and Mrs. Brown traveled extensively , which brings us to the Titanic . <p> One aspect of Maggie was well-portrayed in the 1960s movie  --  and presumably in Paramount 's new twist on her tale  --  she was , indeed , unsinkable . <p> In fact , it was Maggie who gave herself that moniker  --  queried on how she survived the Titanic 's sinking , while so many others died , she reportedly replied , " Typical Brown luck . We 're unsinkable . " <p> The Titanic sailed from England on April 12 , 1912 . Brown was one of 2,223 people on board ; paying 27 pounds , 14 shillings , five pence for her first-class cabin . The approximate 1998 equivalent ? $ 124,000 . <p> Two days later , at 11:40 in the evening , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 882-foot-long ship could n't steer clear in time . The scene that ensued must have been terrifying and bizarre : the orchestra playing to calm passengers ' nerves ; the crew blocking the third-class doors so poorer passengers could not claim space on the far-too-few lifeboats ; staff sending up emergency flares ( which the nearby California took for celebratory fireworks ) ; lifeboats built for 65 people casting off with only 28 aboard . <p> Maggie climbed into lifeboat No. 6 and reportedly took charge immediately , ordering the men aboard to row away from the sinking luxury liner . The Titanic went down , with 1,465 people , at 2:20 a.m . <p> The gift shop at the Molly Brown House  --  located in the carriage building  --  features an area devoted to the Titanic and its dramatic voyage . It has photographs of the ship and the cabins , even Maggie 's $ 27,000 insurance claim . <p> Better yet , it displays a card that tells a story never shown in " The Unsinkable Molly Brown . " On the boat ride to New York , Maggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survivors . <p> Perhaps Maggie deserves a bit of Molly 's fame . <p> Specifically <p> The Molly Brown House Museum is in Denver 's Capitol Hill neighborhood at 1340 Pennsylvania St. The phone number is ( 303 ) 832-4092 . <p> The house is open daily June through August and from Tuesday through Sunday from September through May . <p> Hours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. except Sunday , noon to 4 p.m . Tours leave on the hour and half hour with the last tour at 3:30 each day . <p> Admission : adults , $ 5 ; seniors over 65 , $ 3.50 ; children 6 to 12 , $ 1.50 ; children under 6 , free . <p> Patrick Soran is a Colorado free-lance writer .
