I was glad when the divorce was done . Kathyrn took care of it . Over the months I had n't appeared before the judge or even consulted a lawyer . I did n't protest anything . Once in a while pieces of carbon tissue arrived from a place called Bennett , Bennett and Shaw . I put the tissues into a bottom drawer of my desk . It was like getting billed by American Express . <p> It bothered me when the names appeared in the paper . There was an entire list of us , in fact  --  strangers , arranged alphabetically under Petitions for Dissolution . They also had lists for Births , Deaths , Marriages and Final Decrees . Recently they added Bankruptcies . I have become addicted to these lists and read them faithfully . <p> I moved into an apartment in town and Kathyrn kept the place in the country . I did n't like that . I 've always needed room and despised the press of city life . People clutter up at intersections and elevators .

You ca n't hear anything distinctly unless it rises above the general din , and the telephones are always warm . <p> In the country you can hear one thing at a time , like a train crossing an open field far away or a dog barking down the road . If I play it right , though , I may still get the house . Kathyrn has always preferred the city . <p> I did n't really want to see her again . It was n't hate or bitterness or even anger . I simply did not want to see her . There was nothing to talk about , since I had given it all away to escape , and though I did not blame her or myself , there was responsibility , and when we were together , I could n't help thinking about it , and I wanted to be washed of the whole thing . <p> Sometimes we had to talk , however , and she came to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought at Conrad 's .

She had gotten the idea , I knew , from the group she had begun attending six months before we separated , and when she told me she was dating her therapist " seriously , " as she put it , I felt relieved and ashamed . I knew , then , that it was only a matter of time before I got the house , but I felt I had failed , in some deep place I did not understand , about being a man . <p> I was pretty much of a recluse in those days . I would hang around the apartment , which was actually quite comfortable  --  it was high enough to have a good view of the lake  --  and I enjoyed watching the boats at sunset and reading . I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though I am at a place in the firm that makes even conscientiousness unnecessary . There were a couple of small restaurants where I had become known , a little Italian place that did n't open until six and a Mexican cafe , where I used my college Spanish so well that one of the waiters always greeted me with " Mi querido amigo . " <p> But then , two weeks later , when the final decree appeared among the lists , I felt terribly alone and knew that something had to be done . <p> The thought of sitting at bars unnerved me . Going to dinner with Kathyrn or stopping with Jerry Crampton or Bill Upham after work at a darkened booth , I had spent hours studying men with gray at the temples , the second button of their silk shirts open and rings on the third and fourth fingers of their right hands . They wore Vuarnets , drove white Corvettes or black Targas and lived in apartments with metal furniture . <p> The women were scary as well . They wore too much makeup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , from running in the park at dawn . Though they were over thirty or nearly forty , they tried to look like something out of Seventeen , and they combed their hair oddly , like the lead singer of last year 's rock group . <p> They were all divorced , separated , or on the way , and they appeared wealthy , in a kind of glitzy fashion . But I suspected them , and one night Bill pointed out his son 's high-school P. E. coach drooling over an exotic blond in a backless dress . The truly wealthy , I concluded , have their places , and they 're always private . <p> Bill introduced me to his cousin from upstate . She owned a sweet face , a slight lisp , attended community college at night and had a ten-year-old kid . We went to a spaghetti joint downtown and talked about divorce and Maslow 's Hierarchy of Needs . I was terribly embarrassed because , except for the obvious physical heat that passes between a male and female , which only makes me feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , affectionately , The Hunt  --  it was as though I were fifteen again . I had forgotten everything I ever understood concerning women , so I told her  --  a complete stranger  --  all about myself . Even while I spoke , I realized , stupidity , that it was a plea for mercy , and when I saw the look of relief on her face , I knew why monogamy is the curse of mankind . She slept with me that night , but I could not remember her name in the morning . <p> Jerry tried to get me into the singles group he had joined after his divorce from Margaret . <p> " That 's where I met Irene , " he said . " Everybody 's loose and friendly . It 's easy to meet people . You 'll have a great time . You 'll see . The people are mature . They 're actual people . " <p> That was risky enough , since I had n't met many actual people in my life  --  mostly they were sort of people  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , I felt foolish . I was admitting defeat , was n't I , going to a place like this ? Was n't it only a cut above having a dating service set you up ? A failure of the heart , that 's what I was . A wallflower of love . <p> I stood on the threshold with a fishhook in my back , and the only thing that tore me free and into the room was the image of all those Targas and Corvettes lined up in the garage at the Colony Club . <p> There are experiences that put a seal on things . They let you know that one part of your life is finished so that another can begin . Graduations and weddings are like that . Mustering out of the army , being fired or released from prison . A door closes behind you , and the light blinds your eyes . <p> It was a big room , like something attached to a church . On a table near the door were a large coffee urn and styrofoam cups . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an open cigar box stuffed with dollar bills . On the other side of the room was a wet bar . <p> There was a jukebox , a genuine one , with colored water bubbling along the sides . The music , however , came from a cheap stereo . Tables and folding chairs were set along the walls . People were playing cards and drinking . There were couples on the floor dancing . As I entered , I felt a little shock , as the faces , one by one , turned to regard me with longing or distrust . I backed out slowly and went home . <p> The following day the final decree appeared among the lists , and I was sure everyone I knew had snipped it from the paper . I decided to spend time alone . What I was experiencing , I knew , was not a problem with women , though , of course , it was . <p> I began to read in earnest . As an undergraduate I had had a passion for devouring the collected work of someone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has read the novels of George Bernard Shaw . I had the delusion that I could consume every writer of importance , and there was a time there when I kept ten books going at once . <p> In addition , I assigned myself tasks , like going to museums or movies . I walked the streets . I watched the sun set every evening for a week . There was something I had missed along the way , something I had n't learned . <p> One evening a few weeks later , I was sitting at home reading my lists when I heard a sound at the door . It was not a knock , not distinctly anyway . It was as though an open hand had been placed there several times , softly , and removed . I stood up , just a little apprehensive . A rash of burglaries had broken out in the neighborhood , and even old man Sexton , who lived in the apartment next to mine and has a license to carry a gun , was more than usually nervous . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallway through the peephole in the door . Nothing . I opened the door carefully ( the assassin might be pressed to the wall , a butcher knife clutched against his filthy chest ) . There was no one . I frowned . Such things , like the calls you get in the night when the other end just hangs up , annoy me . I began to close the door , when I noticed an envelope lying on the threshold . <p> I felt my neck hair shiver  --  you know the feeling  --  and looked up and down the hallway . The elevator was a couple doors away and across . The little squares with the numbers were dim . There was a stairwell at the other end of the hall . <p> I looked at the envelope . It was letter-size , plain and white . I picked it up and closed the door . <p> I went back to the leather chair under the lamp and sat down . I held the envelope to the light . Then I tore open one end . Inside was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Dear Bob , I saw your name in the divorce column and was surprised . It always seemed to me , when we knew each other , that you were a rather straightforward , stick-to-it kind of man , you know , someone who did n't like defeat , no matter how small the contest . I 'm sorry , of course . Such painful experiences are not easy to bear . Believe me , I understand . Perhaps , though , this is a good thing for you . I have learned that pain is a great teacher , even if this sounds a bit sophomoric . It is the only thing that helps us learn the final truths . You see , I 'm not so silly as you once thought . <p> Love , An Old Friend <p> I went to the door , opened it and scanned the hallway . I returned , sat down again and read the note through several times . Then I went to the window . <p> The water around the edge of the lake was filled with crystal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the buildings above them were just so high , and finally the ribbons trailed away and left a vast , shimmering black pond above which there was only darkness . <p> The emotion I experienced was very curious . It was as though someone had rummaged through my closet while I was reading or had opened my desk drawer and played with my pipe cleaners and stamps . You could n't get into the building without a key , and this time of night Jack Firestone was at his desk doing crosswords . Someone had deliberately tampered with my privacy and gotten away with it . The fact that it was a woman , a woman that I had once known and impressed in some way , kept me from becoming angry . That and the way it was handled . <p> I went to bed and fell immediately to sleep . But I came awake at three A.M. and could not drift off again . At three-thirty I got up and went into the living room and read the note . Then I lit my pipe and went over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , the lake was virtually black . A few lights crawled along Lake Shore Drive , leading poor souls , exhausted at last and wrung from life , to a fitful rest . <p> I finished my pipe , washed my face and went to bed . I was awake until five . <p> The day dawned clear and fair , and only a light wind blew across the water from the north . I went down in the elevator and caught myself looking for some sign of my nocturnal visitor . I felt foolish . lack was already gone . <p> I do n't mind the office anymore and move through it with a fair amount of detachment . I went to Rustigian 's for lunch with Jerry , and he told me about his sister-in-law , who had just separated from her husband . <p> " You 're turning into a hermit , Bobby , " he said , rolling the Stroganoff in his mouth . " It 's not good for you . You need to get out . Circulate . " <p> " What am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " It 's not good for a guy your age to be holed up . " <p> " I 'm not holed up . " <p> " What do you call it , then ! " <p> " Tactical withdrawal . " <p> That night I decided not to go out for dinner . I fixed a ham-and-cheese sandwich and settled down to watch Dan Rather and an early movie . <p> The phone rang . I picked it up , but there was nobody there . I slammed the receiver onto the cradle and went back to my sandwich . The phone rang again . <p> This time I let a few choice epithets fly . Then I stopped . I heard an intake of breath . <p> " Who is it ! " I asked . <p> Then something clicked . I ca n't explain how I knew . Perhaps it was that I had taken the note from my coat pocket many times during the day . There must have been a sympathetic current in the telephone wire . <p> " It 's you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I set the receiver on the counter . I stepped to the front door and paused . My heart was racing . I opened the door , and on the threshold was a white envelope . I picked it up and returned to the phone . She had hung up . <p> I bolted for the door and ran to the elevator . It seemed an hour for the car to get to the lobby . I hurried to the desk , where lack Firestone was doing crosswords . <p> " Hello , Mr. Carstairs , " he said , looking up . <p> " Jack , did a woman come through here just a bit ago ! " <p> " A lot of women come through here , " he said . " What 's a six-letter word meaning ' to show anger or fear ' ? Rhymes with ' idle . " <p> " You would n't have known her , " I said . " She would be a total stranger . " <p> " I get lots of those too . Do you know the word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and then gone back out almost immediately , say in just the amount of time it would have taken to ride the elevator up and down . " <p> " No , I ca n't remember anyone like that . But then I do n't look up every time someone leaves . Just when they come in . " <p> Perhaps she was clever , like a terrorist , and had ridden the elevator to the floor above mine , smoked a cigarette and then walked down the flight of stairs to deliver her white letter bomb to my door . <p> " Thanks anyway , Jack , " I said . <p> " How about the word , Mr. Carstairs ? Any idea ? " <p> I put my hand on the envelope in my pocket . " Bridle , " I said , and walked to the elevator . <p> I waited until I got back to the apartment . I went into the kitchen and finished the sandwich . I drank a glass of milk . Then I walked into the living room and sat down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handwriting on a piece of twenty-weight paper . <p> Dear Bob , You must have wondered about me . I 'm sorry I ca n't say more . <p> simply ca n't tell you who I am . I can not . That 's all . It 's irrational , I know . Even bizarre . Maybe even crazy . But I know I 'm not crazy . Not really . It 's only life that becomes crazy , while all the time we stay quite sane . I would like to see you , but from a distance . If you could entertain a fantastic notion , do you know Beldo 's on West Kensington ? It 's quite a large place but very friendly . Will you go there tomorrow evening , say around 7:30 ? <p> I was astonished . And frightened . I studied the handwriting . The letters were evenly spaced . The words moved gracefully across the page . Her script was lovely and quite feminine , with nice loops and whirls . <p> I felt stupid . I stared at my hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The darkness across the lake had an eerie quality I had not noticed before . There was no depth to it . Ribbons of light fluttered near the shore , but far across the water there was no light at all , nothing , only the darkness like a great black hole into which everything disappeared . <p> I wrote down the names of every woman I had ever made love to . For someone past forty , such a task was not easy . The longer you live , it seems , the more they become one , if only the last one , and I found myself thinking about things I had n't thought about for years . There were some two dozen of them , and I could not remember all the names , so in a few cases I put down visual clues , like The Irish Setter or Breasts the Size of Baseballs . <p> I looked at the list and tried to manufacture personalities . Could it be this one ? I wondered . Or that one ? But I found myself remembering how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , and I felt sensually but morbidly old . I dozed off and found myself surrounded by them . They all had the time of the relationship written on them . Eight months . A year . Two years . They looked at me and waved . Then there was Kathryn staring at me . She had twelve years printed on her back . I woke , read the note over several more times and switched on the television . <p> The following night I was at Beldo 's at seven o'clock . I had bought a new camel hair coat the week before , and I wore that , with black wool slacks and a black tie . <p> I was overdressed , of course . Beldo 's is not that kind of place . It reminds me a lot of Lefty O'Doul 's in San Francisco . Old wooden floors , a polished , dimly lit bar and framed black-and-white pictures of dead baseball players on the walls . It was cafeteria style , like O'Doul 's , with booths along the sides and tables crowded into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a chic place thirty years ago , but the chic did n't go there anymore . <p> I sat at the bar and looked around . I had n't been there myself in five years , and all the help had changed . I recognized no one . Whoever it was , though , I would know her as soon as I saw her , I was sure of it , and I wanted to spot her when she walked in . <p> She never did . I waited until eight o'clock and then eight-thirty . I got angry and depressed and a bit tipsy . There are just so many gin and tonics one can consume on an empty stomach . So finally I stood in line for a hot roast beef sandwich and cole slaw , and then I went home . <p> I do not like mysteries , and I imagine that 's why I am not religious . The thought of forces lurking beyond that weigh and judge us has always struck me as unfair and capricious . It 's hard enough getting through this life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left for work late the following morning and had breakfast at Flag 's . It 's one of those places tourists never discover because it closes after lunch . The breakfast menu has two dozen omelettes and eight different waffles , and the coffee is the best in town . I lingered over a third cup and studied the vital statistics . By the time I got to the office , I was on a pretty even keel . <p> But there on my desk , propped against the pipe rack , was a plain white envelope . My hand trembled when I touched it . <p> I buzzed my secretary . " Mary , who brought this letter ? " <p> " It was special delivery , Mr. Carstairs . " <p> " Did a messenger bring it ? " <p> " No sir . An old man came into the office and handed it to me . He said it was important and that you should have it right away . " <p> She had paid someone off the street to deliver it . " Thank you , Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked to the window . The view from my office is one of the reasons I dislike the city . Crowded streets , tarred rooftops and sunlight smeared against glary windows . <p> I sat down and opened the letter . <p> Dear Bob , Thank you for being so trustworthy . Whatever age does to us , it has done to you most kindly . You looked quite handsome in that beautiful jacket . It was such a delight to see you again after all this time . Is n't Beldo 's a quaint old place ? I 'm sorry I ever left it . I 'm sorry too that you had to eat your roast beef alone . If it 's any consolation , my dinner grew cold on the plate . <p> Included find a ticket to the new play at the Bradley Friday night . I hope you can go . <p> Love <p> I could n't believe it . She had been there the entire time . <p> Oddly , I was not angry . I was not even depressed at having missed her . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  whoever she was  --  suffered more than I. <p> Thus began a series of meetings that were not meetings at all , but adventures , the like of which not I nor anyone else had ever encountered . <p> I went to the Bradley , of course . It 's a small theater on the South Side that does avant-garde things by young playwrights who do n't shave . This one was about a girl from the country seduced and abandoned in the big city . She was pregnant by someone who never appeared but whose presence was always felt , like a kind of deus mysteriosus , and she lived with an old Mexican who had been with Cesar Chavez in Bakersfield and was disillusioned . The girl felt her life was a useless mess , but she wanted everything for the baby , because it was the only thing she had truly loved . This touched the Mexican , since his son had been killed in a skirmish in a lettuce field . He wanted to take the girl someplace safe and pure , but he was dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the son should lead the movement to save the world when he was born , for this was , she felt , the best part of the man who had abandoned her , a Vietnam veteran with no left hand . Despair , failure , anguish and longing . Tennessee Williams with acne . <p> I looked the house over . At intermission I strolled about the lobby studying each woman 's face . I walked up and down every aisle . I found myself catching glimpses of things I thought I recognized , eyebrows here , a nose or cheekbone there , the way a head turned or an arm lay along a wooden seat . She was hiding again . Maybe she was even backstage . I thought about leaving , but decided that would n't be fair , to her or the playwright . <p> The girl died in childbirth and the Mexican adopted the son . <p> Cards began coming in the mail . One week a card arrived every day . They were the kind with funny little animals and clever sayings , like , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and there would be a gray elephant on a trapeze swinging into the arms of another , or one with a bland , blue little cat being chased by a mutty dog with a pink collar and black nose and the caption , " Ours is a classic relationship . " Sometimes tickets came with the cards . <p> I found myself attending volleyball games , badminton tournaments and platform-diving championships . I watched the shooting of a detective movie on location and the dedication of a new thirty-story building by the son of the Irish immigrant who had bought the land . I ate dinner at a half-dozen neighborhood restaurants I had never heard of , though I have lived in and out of the city all my life . I paid for nothing but I did not feel guilty , because I thoroughly enjoyed myself , which was totally unexpected . I had a patroness with eyes unlike my own , yet we were strangely compatible . <p> I struggled against it at first . The acceptance , I mean . That was natural . Every place we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . I carried binoculars and watched the stands . I badgered ticket sellers about reservations . I walked through stadiums , parking lots and stations . I waited outside restrooms . <p> I even called two names on my list of former lovers , the least remembered and the least gratifying : Carolyn Bally and Pat Thompkins . I ran them down through old friends . They were both married . <p> " Did you send the Letters ? " I asked . <p> They said I was crazy , but they knew of the divorce . <p> At a modern-art exhibit I saw a woman who strangely attracted me . It was the way the hips moved , I think . I followed her from room to room . She looked back at me nervously . Her chin seemed familiar , as though I had once touched it . Her hair was cut across her face , like a helmet . I wanted to cradle her head in my arms . <p> She paused before the splashes of color framed upon the walls , turning her head this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I went up and stood next to her and turned my head this way and that . She looked at me and smiled . She walked quickly into another room and I followed . Her skin was like cream in firelight . I knew I had never seen her before , but I was thoroughly convinced she was the one . She was beautiful , full of passion and joy , and I had always wanted her . <p> She walked briskly toward a guard in a green uniform and I stopped . She turned to look at me once more , meaningfully , then stepped into an adjacent room . I went out the main entrance and waited . <p> I waited forty-five minutes before she came out . I had it all planned what I would say . <p> " Would you like to see a table-tennis tournament ! Perhaps you 'd care for dinner at a little Hungarian restaurant across town ! Would you enjoy a Buster Keaton film festival ! " <p> She stopped and looked at me with fear . <p> " Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just please pretend to be the one ? " <p> But I heard my name called , and when I looked back , she was gone . <p> It was Jerry , wife in tow . <p> " Glad to see you out , kid , " he said . " This is just the very kind of thing you need . " <p> " Hello , Jerry , " I said , looking at his new wife , who was rather mousey but pleasant . <p> " Yessir , the very thing . He who expands his mind never lives alone . " <p> " Confucius ? " I said . <p> " No , Crampton . " <p> And that 's when I was struck with a desperate idea . <p> Jerry and I were about the same size . When the next invitation and ticket arrived , I dressed him in my trench coat and blue pinstripe , and I went to a novelty shop and bought a makeup kit . <p> I decided on an old man , with gray hair and beard . I bought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I carried a silver-headed walking stick shaped like an acorn , stooped over a bit and resurrected my foray upon the boards of college theater . I felt absurd but oddly free . <p> It was a dog show . Jerry sat in my seat , a cap pulled forward on his head , and I prowled through the hall , limping slightly , like the Phantom of the Opera . Between wizened cheeks and powdered brows , my eyes burned like coals . Nothing escaped me . I was a fiend of curiosity . I lurked behind cages . I huddled in corners . I watched every woman who was under fifty . I felt exultant , invisible . This time I would have her . She could not escape . <p> And she did n't . Only forty minutes after I had begun , I saw a tall , slender figure standing quite still , out of the line of sight of the judges ' area , staring intently at the man in the trench coat and gray cap . <p> I had come up behind her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she . I had the same feeling I had had that night when she called . <p> I stood suddenly erect , filled with elation , and threw off my cape . There was a sound , several sounds , a general surf of sound that broke toward her . My instant rejuvenation had startled the people near me . I saw her turn slightly , the wide brim of her hat lift just enough . There was the line of a white chin , the glint of a dark eye . She put a hand to her face , spun about and broke for the exit . <p> " Wait , " I pleaded . " Please wait . " <p> I began to run . I could have caught her easily , but I stopped . There was something about her flight that was almost hysterical . <p> The next morning the letter came . It was so strangely painful and frightened that I decided never to trick her again . <p> She forgave me and we went on , always separate , and I never recognized , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled into a companionship of untouched life , like two deaf mutes in parallel universes .

" Everyone stared . " Listen ! " I repeated . The lecturer , a gray-headed old man with a handlebar mustache , broke into a raucous laugh . " It 's all right ! " I yelled , spinning around like a dervish . " I love you ! I love you ! " <p> Then , smiling , I sat down . I did n't feel like a fool at all . <p> And that was the end . <p> The letters stopped . I grew frantic , thinking I had done something wrong . I stayed home from work , hoping there might be a call . I spent hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that somehow everything had been quite perfect .
