Section : THE ARTS MOVIES After 40 years , ' The Crucible ' hits the screen . High concept : sizzling sex in old Salem . Here 's how a classic went Hollywood but kept its virtue . <p> AS IT TURNS OUT , ARTHUR MILLER 'S ever-popular play " The Crucible " makes a good movie  --  but what a , great bad movie the making of " The Crucible " would make . It would be one of those let's-put-on-a-show pictures , with Miller 's son Bob , a novice producer , shouting , " Hey ! We can use Dad 's old play ! " Then Dad himself gamely sitting down to write the script . Then Bob pitching this screenplay about the witch hunt in 17th-century Salem ; Mass. to philistine movie moguls who want an upbeat ending . Enter classy director Nicholas Hytner , who at 40 could be the 81-year-old Miller 's grandson . Scenes with them bonding at the computer as Miller dramatizes episodes only alluded to in the play , cuts , restructures . And finally , Miller 's daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel Day-Lewis . They get married ; " The Crucible " becomes a hit . Except for that last little thing  --  " The Crucible , only opens this week  --  we 're not making this up . <p> Since 1958 , " The Crucible " has been on a stage almost continuously in some part of the world , and it should have been a natural for the movies . " The story is really about sex , " says Bob Miller , paraphrasing the pitch that got him a dozen we'll-call-yous before Hytner , the British theater directorwho made the well-received 1994 film " The Madness of King George , " took the project on . " It 's about relationships , it 's about betrayal , it 's about forgiveness . These are all hot topics in Hollywood . " Yet Hollywood discerned that it was also really about Massachusetts Bay Puritans in the 1690s ( not hot ) , and really really about the Red scare of the 1950s , when both Sen. Joseph McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee were sifting the State Department , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In " The Crucible " the Salem witch trials , with their obsessive fear of conspiracy , their confessions and their rattings-out , play like the army-McCarthy hearings . ( In the new film , actor Bruce Davison , playing the local minister , deliberately evokes lawyer Boy Cohn 's whispering into McCarthy 's ear . ) To the movie industry , the play was at first too hot to handle : in the ' 50s Hollywood blacklisted actors , directors and writers , often on evidence of Salem-quality shakiness . By the time black-listing ended , " The Crucible " had become something filmmakers were even more loath to touch : a classic supposedly bristling with moral and political messages . <p> Yet Miller built more ambiguity into " The Crucible " than he 's generally given credit for : no character is wholly admirable or contemptible , and its ultimate message maysimply be Watch your back . In his opening-night review , the influential critic Walter Kerr called it a " mechanical parable , " but today it 's possible to shrug off the play 's allegorical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50s now seems to allude to all sorts of things that might be on moviegoing minds in the ' 90s : from adults accused of ritual child abuse to 6-year-olds accused of sexual harassment , from fundamentalist dread of the Great Satan to fundamentalist dread of the New World Order , from contamination by the AIDS virus to contamination by illegal immigrants to contamination by secondhand smoke . " There 's a kind of floating paranoia in the world , " says Miller . " I think that 's maybe what makes the play seem to be always topical . " <p> But as much as its broad-brush relevance , what probably helped get " The Cruccible " made is just what Bob Miller said : it really is about sex . The adulterous affair between farmer John Proctor ( Day-Lewis ) and his young servant Abigail Williams ( Winona Ryder ) sets in motion the whole story of a scorned mistress trying to kill her lover 's wife with a blood-drinking ritual , then implicating half the town in accusations of witchcraft . In the play , one of Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dissembling . " But she and the gaggle of girls she leads by the nose are n't simply frauds . What 's really whizzing around the Salem meetinghouse  --  as any skeptical observer of the occult would recognize  --  are n't spectral presences but displaced sexual energies . Forget the cultural deepthink . This is the kind of thing Hollywood knows how to sell . <p> In The New York Times , The Nation magazine 's publisher Victor Navasky ( who wrote a history of the Hollywood blacklist ) has claimed " my spies tell me that 20th Century Fox intends to market ' The Crucible ' as a ' Fatal Attraction ' story . " Independent producer David Picker , called in by Fox to ride herd on Hytner and the Millers , says this is " palpable nonsense , " but the trailer has two shots of Ryder groping for Day-Lewis 's privates , a flash of the single nude scene and a voice-over intoning , " What they can not possess they must destroy ! " So what did anyone expect ? Alistair Cooke in an armchair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " would be Kafka costumed for a Thanksgiving pageant . <p> After all  --  to be really crass for a moment  --  the studio has $25 million in this . It 's chump change by " Independence Day " standards , but far more than such comparably honorable films as " The Remains of the Day " or " Dead Man Walking . " The producers were able to rent old costumes from the 1995 turkey " The Scarlet Letter " ( the " Crucible " cast went to see it in Boston while filming last fall and howled with laughter all the way through ) , but the generous budget came in handy when they had to rebuild 1692 Salem on Hog Island off the Massachusetts coast . The east could n't have come cheap , either , though it came gladly . " We went to Daniel immediately , " says Hytner , " because of course you would . Realistically , the reason we were able to spend $25-odd million is because Daniel committed to it . That 's just the nuts and bolts of Hollywood . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . " <p> Even the choosy Shakespearean actor Paul Scofield signed on quickly to play Danforth , the head witch hunter . " He 's rather famous for saying no , very courteously , within 24 hours . " Most eager of all may have been Winona Ryder . " The waiting period was agonizing , " she says . " I knew Daniel had approval and I knew Daniel , so I knew that probably would n't be a problem , but in my head I was going , ' What if Arthur Miller goes to the video store anf the only thing they have to rent of mine is some terrible movie and he just says no ? ' " Ryder was the only major player w ho was n't stage-trained , but she need n't have worried about Miller 's reaction . " I 've finally found that the right actress can do what I 'd envisioned , " he says of Ryder 's sexy-scary performance , " which is to show that Abigail is somebody with an agenda who 's also off her rocker . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 ) , the real-life Proctor in this 60s ( not Daniel Day-Lewis ) ; any affair between them was a historical iffy but dramatically visionary inference on Miller 's part . And the real-life proceedings in Salem were even more brutal than the film suggests . The harrowing scene in which heavy stones are laid on a stubborn old man named Giles Corey until he dies under their weight is more harrowing still in an eyewitness account : Corey 's tongue popped out and " the Sher riff with his Cane forced it in again , when he was dying . " Present-day Salem folk acted as extras in the film , and the cast found them both amusing ( " I have the original rock that crushed Giles Corey in my driveway , " mimics Bruce Davison ) and a tad chill ing . " It 's the most ethnically pure of any place I 've been to where people speak English , " says Hytner . " It 's unbelievable . " <p> But Ryder has nothing but praise for the local girls who played the local girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely pivotal in the movie , " she says . " And none of them were in a movie before . Nick sat down with all of them and gave them a name and where they lived and what boy they liked , and a real history . His technique for getting us riled up was incredible . He had us play it like we were actually being attacked and possessed , not pretending . The word ' pretend ' never came into play . And I overheard some of the girls complainging of weird hallucinations . " <p> So let 's see if we 've got this straight  --  it sounds like something out of Pirandello , not Arthur Miller . " The Crucible " has local girls pretending to be local girls pretending to be possessed , and pulling it off by pretending that they 're not preten ding ? There 's a similar nothing-is-real quality to the vision of Miller taking a jack hammer to the monument of modern theater he created . " He was the least respectful person of it , " says Hytner . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up and say , ' We c a n't afford to shoot such and such a scene ; send me another , by fax , tomorrow , please . ' And it would come ! " Was this Arthur Miller ? And even Day-Lewis 's marriage two weeks ago to Miller 's daughter Rebecca , an actress and filmaker , sounds like something s omebody dreamed up . Poet laureate 's son weds ... you know . Very Irving Wallace . The couple met because of the movie , but it was no on-set romance . During shooting , says Rebecca 's half-brother Bob , " Daniel was halfway between John Proctor and Daniel Day-Lewis . " <p> So our imaginary movie about the making of " The Crucible " seems headed for a closing montage of hearts and dollar signs . And not the least cheery aspect of this story is how faithfully the film preserves the play 's bracing cheerlessness . In Miller ' s rigorously Puritan critique of Puritanism , nobody gets off the hook : paranoia is a predictable perversion of the human spirit , doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and a private surrender to passion brings down not just a pai r of lovers but a whole community . In reconfiguring the play as a film , Miller never considered letting John Proctor dodge the gallows . " That would have been like Hamlet getting into a Porche and driving off , " he says . In its time , " The Crucible " has shu cked off its dated specificity and soared above thousands of bum productions . Now it 's even survived , with its dignity intact , becoming what Fox calls ( you guessed it ) " a major motion picture "  --  the literary equivalent of the satanic pact . When that rope finally twangs and we fade to black , it may not seem like an upbeat ending . But for our story it is . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Spellbinder .
