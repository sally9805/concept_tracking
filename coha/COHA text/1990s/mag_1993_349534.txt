NATION <P> G-7 Summit <P> At the Tokyo meeting of the leaders of the seven major industrial democracies , Bill Clinton acted the parts of statesman and campaigner in equal measure . While the Japanese indulged a fascination with his wife Hillary , Clinton courted a younger generation of Japanese politicians . In public appearances he urged the Japanese to open their markets  --  a tactic that helped him cast the summit for his public back home as one more part of his jobs program . The meeting started on a promising and surprising note : an agreement in principle by trade ministers to cut anti-import tariffs on hundreds of items ( although not the most contentious ones ) , which could lead to a resumption of the stalled GATT world trade talks . By the end of the week , other substantive achievements were announced : a $3 billion aid plan for Russia and a " framework " agreement that will guide future negotiations to reduce Japan 's trade surplus with the U.S. <P> Perot and the " Radical Middle " <P> A national survey by President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Ross Perot would vote for him if he ran in 1996 . The poll described this group as a " radical middle " that Clinton must win over to be re-elected . <P> Water , Water , Still Everywhere <P> Floodwaters kept rising to never-before-recorded levels along the upper Mississippi River . While estimates of crop damage exceeded $1 billion , more than 4,500 families also face property damage . <P> The Biggest Jackpot <P> There was a small-town winner for the very big , $111 million prize in the Powerball lottery held by 14 states and the District of Columbia . Less than four hours before the drawing , Leslie C. Robins , a 30-year-old English teacher , bought the winning ticket for his fiance at a grocery store in Fond du Lac , Wisconsin . After learning that they had beaten odds of 55 million to 1 , the couple fled to Florida to escape the media . <P> Acquittal in Idaho <P> White separatist Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris , a family friend , were acquitted in the 1992 slaying of a U.S. marshal . The marshal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weaver 's remote cabin to arrest him for failing to appear in court on a weapons charge . Weaver 's 14-year-old-son also died in the shoot-out . The shoot-out was followed by an 11-day siege in which Weaver 's wife was killed by a federal sniper . <P> More Jail Time for Keating <P> Charles Keating Jr. , whose greed and recklessness made him an apt symbol of the savings and loan calamity , was sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison for draining the Irvine , California-based Lincoln Savings , a swindle that cost taxpayers $2.6 billion . The sentence will run concurrently with a 10-year state prison sentence that Keating , 69 , is serving . <P> A Third-Rate Burglary ? <P> They did n't actually use the word Watergate , but Democratic Party officials told Chicago police that thieves stole computer disks , research notebooks and strategy documents from a suite they had been using as a temporary headquarters at the Stouffer 's Riviere in Chicago , where the Republican National Committee was meeting one floor below . <P> WORLD <P> Trying to Expel the Sheik   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
