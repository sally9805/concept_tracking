Robert Mapplethorpe 's boys-in-bondage photographs made the right wing snort and paw the ground . But the left has its own kind of puritanism lately , which submits depictions of the human body to a test of political correctness . A 1964 work by Sol LeWitt failed the test of Elizabeth Broun , director of the Smithsonian 's NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART in Washington . LeWitt 's piece  --  part of a touring show of work inspired by the 19th century photographer Eadweard Muybridge  --  is a long black box with 10 portholes . A viewer passing from one to the next sees successive shots of an advancing naked woman . Broun compared the work to a peep show and removed it from the walls , until the resulting uproar compelled her to put it back . Broun says she was n't practicing censorship but insists that she is n't obliged to give a public stage to work she finds " degrading . " Substitute the term " tax dollars " for " public stage , " and you have Senator Jesse Helms ' argument against $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message from both sides to artists ? Stick to abstraction ; it 's safer . R.L.
