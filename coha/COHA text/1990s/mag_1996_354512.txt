FOR ANYONE CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT it is like to work at TIME , Calvin Trillin 's 1980 novel , Floater , is required reading . The story of a hapless writer at a national weekly newsmagazine suspiciously like this one , it skewers some of TIME 's most revered traditions , including this very page . Though Trillin now tries to pretend that Floater is " made up , " he in fact gathered inside information during nearly three years on TIME 's staff . In 1960 , after graduating from Yale and serving in the Army , he joined the Atlanta bureau , reporting on the civil rights movement . He then moved to New York , where he became a " floater , " writing for various sections of the magazine as needed . To avoid Religion stories , he has said , he attached the word " alleged " to every event of religious significance , as in " the alleged Crucifixion " or " the alleged parting of the Red Sea . " The tactic never worked . " The editors just crossed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything they had had experience with , it was smart-aleck writers . " <P> Happily , no hard feelings remained . With this issue , Trillin 's deadpan humor and lucid prose return to the pages of TIME as a regular feature . He will be writing a weekly column on a characteristically far-reaching range of subjects . " Sometimes it 'll be about Washington , " he says . " Sometimes it 'll be about what 's in my basement . " Whatever he turns his attention to is usually just fine with his readers . " Trillin is one of the great delights of American journalism , " says managing editor Walter Isaacson . " He has the eyes and ears of a great reporter . " <P> Since his first stint at TIME , Trillin 's wry political commentary , his accounts of gastronomical journeys in search of the perfect barbecue and his compassionate reportage of small-town America have appeared in the New Yorker , where he is a staff writer , in a syndicated newspaper column and in the Nation , to which he contributes a weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration when the phrase " If you knew what John Sununu " came to him in an inspired flash ) . His 19th book , Messages from My Father , is to be published this spring . <P> Not everything comes easily to Trillin , 60 , who lives in a Greenwich Village brownstone with his wife Alice . His new column , he worries , is slightly shorter than the one he is accustomed to writing . As a result , he modestly warns , " the readers are going to have to get their profound thoughts somewhere else . " That , as Trillin admirers well know , is only allegedly true .
