Summers we went to England . Every May , my mother dragged the Samsonite luggage down from our attic and started packing . In flew the permanent-press dresses , the wool skirts and lamb's-wool sweaters she 'd bought for herself the summer before . There were my clothes too : black rubber Wellingtons , since rain was always a threat ; leather sandals with a punched design ; polo shirts and navy shorts , for I insisted on dressing the same as my cousin George . Squeezed into the edges of the overstuffed suitcase were packages of sheets and pillowcases for my aunt , American denim jackets and dungarees for George and my younger cousin Timmy . My father 's suitcase smelled of leather and tobacco . He smoked a pipe , and brought a zippered pouch with pipe cleaners , a summer 's supply of cherry-wood tobacco , and six different pipes . His shirts , each one sheathed in a sky-blue ribbon from the Chinese laundry , were lined up stiffly on the bed like a row of headless soldiers , pockets tattooed with ink stains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned topsy-turvy ; drawers gaped , dry-cleaning wrap lay wadded on the floor . Textbooks and papers from my father 's study were spread about the bed , night tables , and carpet . " When are you going to organize this ? " my mother would shout at him . Running a hand through his rumpled gray hair , he would look at her in anguish , and say , " I 'm trying , I 'm really trying , Sonia . " The simplest of decisions confused my father . For hours while my mother packed , he paced and chewed on his pipe stem , scribbled notes on napkins , until , with a weary sigh , he settled onto the bed , next to the careful piles of clothes , with his face in his hands . Around and around his mulling went , all about physics and philosophy and mathematics , how to finish his book this summer , so that the question of what books and papers he should bring remained a damp , annoying mystery in his mind . " Just tell me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't decide , Sonia , " he would answer . " Put in whatever you want . " " That 's an original idea , " she would fume , and nevertheless fill one medium-sized suitcase with his belongings , sort his crumpled papers into manila folders , label them with a marker , and type a checklist of the books and articles he wanted to read that summer . My father was a dreamer , a storyteller , a thinker . Always restless , he moved from mathematics to physics to philosophy . He had a fickleness of character , a terror of the finish line . For years , he 'd been struggling to complete his book , an extraordinary opus that blended the various disciplines he had tramped through , and dared to resolve the particlewave paradox of light . At the college where he taught , he was the resident guru , sitting on his leather throne in his ferociously messy office . In half-sentences , he sketched for students the gloomy tunnels of belief and the well-lit corridors of rational thought . He showed a passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Caribbean cadences and bits of Hindi , made a gentle , if troubled , truce between the two . Sometimes I accompanied my father to the college , where I scurried to keep up with his long legs , his folder of papers tucked under my arm . My father was tall , with shiny brown skin and unruly silver hair atop a soft , youthful face . He moved in loose-limbed thrusts , as if he could not be bothered with the physical weight of his clothes . One September day , when I was nine years old , he brought me to his History of Ideas class . I sat shyly on his desk , next to a stack of books , knocking my heels against the wooden side . " This here my daughter , Megan , " he announced to the room of puzzled faces . " She 's going to teach you a lot of things about philosophy . " The students stared and giggled . " All right . I can see you think I 'm joking . You know what my daughter asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think before I knew how to speak ? ' " A boy snickered . " So what ? " " But it 's an essential question . " My father took off his jacket and wrote on the blackboard : 1 + 1 = ? The boy yelled out , " You got ta be kidding . " My father perched on the edge of the desk , eyes bright . " Now can anyone tell me , how much is one plus one ? " " What is this , remedial math ? " " Just answer the question . " The boy groaned out a " Two . " " You sure ? " " Of course I 'm sure ! " " How do you know what two really is ? Or do you know that a composite of one and one is two ? There you go , my man , one of the most essential questions in philosophy , what my daughter asked about before : a priori knowledge . " As the boy 's face fell , a triumphant fire glowed in me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm confused . You told us to read The Republic . " " Forget about the assignment . Tell me this : What is a philosopher ? " " Someone who asks dumb questions ? " the boy who snickered before asked . " Very good ! " my father said . " Almost . That 's my daughter , then . Meggie asks questions all the time . Where do I come from ? ' Why ca n't time move backward ? ' she asks . Why , why , why ? She drives me crazy with all her questions ! " I smiled , delighted that my father had remembered what I said , and thought it important . " She 's not a philosopher , " a girl with straight blond hair objected . " That 's just curiosity . " " Even better ! " my father exclaimed . " Plato tells us the very same thing . If curiosity makes a philosopher , you will find many a strange being will have a title to the name . ' " He pulled a book out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So why is n't my daughter here a philosopher ? " " Because she , does n't have answers ? " " Because she 's too short ? " My father scooped up the rest of the books , carried them to the open window , and flung them outside . The class watched in amazement as the books took wing on the autumn breeze and settled on the grassy slope . Then my father drew the blinds shut . " Imagine you are in a room like this , chained to your desk . The most you can see are shapes thrown against a wall from a distant fire , the shadows of trees as they move in the wind . For all you know , though , those shadows are the real trees . " All of a sudden I open the blinds and now you can see the trees and the grass up on a little hill . You are very curious , like my daughter here , so you want to move closer to the fire , to the source of this new sensation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill . Your eyes ache , you 're not used to so much light . This is Plato 's parable of the cave . The cave is the world of sight and the light of the fire is the sun . The journey upward is into the intellectual world . " I had shut my eyes . I had lost myself , my body , and was traveling in a boat in the night . My father had slipped into his Caribbean storytelling voice that lapped all around , sweet and soothing , as he coaxed me toward the distant , glimmering questions he lit up ahead . " When I was a little boy in my short-short pants , I grew up in darkness . The only light I had was a kerosene lamp . I had nothing else but the wisdom of my father and mother . So I learned to read and ask questions that helped me journey to the truth . " Now , our man Plato also learned from the wisdom of his forefathers , the pre-Socratics . He believed that every one of us has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the light of the world . Think of our journey as a bridge of fire , gently swaying over a chasm of ignorance . Slowly , slowly , step by step , we walk along this bridge of fire , suspended in the air , into the grand radiance of knowledge . " My eyes opened and I realized my father was gripping me by the waist . I was hanging in the air . One of the students had pulled up the blinds to show a maintenance man picking up the books , one by one , from the slope outside . The other students ' faces lifted with surprise . A warm pleasure trickled to my stomach . I knew they were jealous of me because I was his daughter and my life with him would be extraordinary . Yet there was always his strange preoccupation that dragged us back into darkness and uncertainty . On the question of light my father remained stumped . For years , he hung , like a frightened acrobat , in the balance between particle and wave . The rope could suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was he who contemplated snapping , and this frightened him . It also frightened me . For something was never quite right with my father . But I am getting ahead of myself . Almost every night , my father told me stories , drew me into his questions , until I grew drowsy with sleep . His voice became a sound , the struck notes of a song , the start of the world as I was coming to know it . This is a story about many things . It is about light . It is about a mixed-up family that came together every summer to pretend it was whole . It is about the tales of long before . And it is about a father who one day stopped talking . And as with all stories , we must start at the beginning .
