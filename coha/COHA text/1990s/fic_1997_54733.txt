The second of our cover stories is Esther Friesner 's ' King of the Cyber Trifles . " Esther won the short story Nebula in 1996 , and her story , " A Birthday , " from our August 1995 issue was a finalist for the Hugo . Her most recent novels are Child of the Eagle , published by Baen , and The Sword of Mary , published by White Wolf . <p> About this story , Esther writes , " The title was knocking around in my head for a while and the request for a story based on that gorgeous cover painting gave me the perfect excuse . ( By the way , for the benefit of the literarily deprived , the title 's a pun on King of the Khyber Rifles , which I confess to having read only in the Classics Illustrated Comics form . ) " <p> My name is Blaze Knightly . I 'm a cop . A webdick , if you want to get technical about it . My beat stretches from the farthest reaches of the galaxy to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It was nine-fifteen on a Monday night . Things were pretty quiet in LA . It had been one hell of a three-day weekend . Most of the weirdos and sick puppies had burned themselves to ash pretty steadily from Friday afternoon on . Now they were either holed up in their crummy little rooms , sleeping off their crummy little cyberbenders , or staring down both barrels of their crummy little workweek lives and wishing they could plug into http : //oblivion.com . Back to work , back to reality checks . I could almost feel sorry for the poor suffering bastards . Yeah , sure I could , if they did n't screw up my life so much . Charity begins ad hominem . The hell with ' em . <p> Kaminski was on the desk . He smiled when he saw me . " Well , well , look what the net dragged in . How 's it going , Knightly ? Inside dope says you racked up some heavy points playing Outback last Saturday night . Y'know , that 's not the way you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Save it , LaShana , " I shot back . Kaminski blushed . He was six-two of solid Polska kielbasa , three times wounded in the line of duty back when he was still on the real streets . The squadroom scuttlebutt had it that he was the man who 'd busted up the Northridge Rawheads and their sweet little monopoly dealing " twinkle . " They said he 'd acted alone , armed with nothing more than his sidearm and a bootleg tape of Richard Simmons ' Sweatin ' to the Oldies . They did n't like to talk about how he 'd done it . There are some things even a hardened cop ca n't think about if he wants to stay sane and keep his lunch down . <p> Yet this was the same man who , every chance he got , slapped on the visor and the gloves , snuggled back into the sensofa , and strutted his stuff up and down the netways as LaShana Shabazz , She Who Must Be Obeyed Or She 'll Hurt You , But Only If You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hell , it was n't even something everybody could say in one breath . But I knew it and I could say it just fine . If I wanted to , that is . <p> Kaminski 's a good cop . I flashed him a grin and a wink . His secret was safe with me . I was n't going to give him grief . Besides , they said he still had that Richard Simmons tape somewhere . " Hoxie in ? " I asked . <p> " In and on , " Kaminski said . " You want I should  --  ? " His fingers poised over the keypad , ready to hit the sequence that would yank our beloved captain back to Earth . <p> I waved him off . " Nab , why bother ? I 'll just find him once I 'm on myself . " I strode past the desk and into the squadroom . <p> It was an easy night . Only about half the sensofas were occupied . The rest of the force m Chang , Hoffman , Shwartz , O'Donnell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  were holding down desks , up to their pretty little asses in pixelwork . You could 've repainted the squadroom a nice deep shade of blue from some of the language they were using . I waved to them as I headed for my cell . Some of them waved back . Someone really oughts tell those guys that when you wave , you use all the fingers on your hand , not just the middle one . <p> I could n't blame them . If I were them , I 'd hate my guts too . What did those poor yingtongs have to work with ? A shared netset where your hands fit the gloves like a skateboard fits a blimp hangar and you were lucky if the only thing you caught from the helmet was a fierce case of dandruff . And the futon covers on the squadroom sensofas ? Let 's put it this way : Do n't ask about the stains . You really , really do n't want to know . <p> As for me , I went into my cell and shut the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in the dark before I finally touched the lights . They came up slow and sweet , like good sex or a nice taffy apple . I 'm a fool for a nice taffy apple , especially in a garter belt . <p> And there it was , my place , my base , my little foot-in-the-door of the ' great Jehovah 's Witnesses roadtrip that is Justice . I sat down on the sensofa and the softly napped cotton almost purred under my touch . My custom-fitted helmet waited for me on its stand , visor up , with my gloves neatly laid out on the shelf below . I picked up the ID monocle and let it get a good , close look at my retinal patterns . " Here 's looking at you , kid , " I muttered . As soon as I was cleared for entry I geared up , lay back , and slid into the net . <p> I was no sooner gliding down the strands than I had company . *Knightly ? * It was Hoxie . I 'd know those teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A zillion forms you can take in the ' scape and my captain 's the giant rat of Sumatra . He says it 's because he 's a big Arthur Conan Doyle fanboy and all of the other shapes in the Holmes universe were already taken by the time he could tag one . I say that when a man knows himself that well , who am I to ask questions ? <p> The rat sat in a sherbet-colored striped beach chair set down in the middle of Generic Tropical Paradise #14C , a can of Coors in one paw , a Harvard T-shirt covering his furry chest . He was sipping the brew through a straw . Class will tell . <p> *Got a hot one for you. * The words seemed to echo inside my skull . When Hoxie hit the web , he never opted to have his virtual self simply talk . The one time I cared enough to ask why , he told me : " Talking rats are n't real . " Yeah , and telepathic , Coors-swilling , Harvard-educated rats are ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do tell . " I was still in shimmer-mode ; I had n't yet picked a personal seeming to suit this conversation , mostly because I had n't yet decided what would piss off Hoxie most . We 've all got our priorities . " Let me guess : Some teenaged mouth-breather from Malibu discovered that the girl of his dreams is really the guy next door ? Open-and-shut City . I can knock down a dozen cases like that on my coffee break . " <p> " So could a rookie , " Hoxie replied . He bared his yellow teeth at me in what passed for a smile . To be frank , it looked a hell of lot friendlier than the grins he gave me when he was in human form . ( In Hoxie 's case , the term human is more by way of a biotag than an accurate description , even when he 's offline. ) *Nuh-uh , Knightly , this is something you can sink your teeth into . If you 're gon na have teeth any time soon. * <p> If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouthing off wise like that , he was right . <p> " You mean like this ? " I asked casually , and in the flicker of a pixel I erupted from shimmer-mode into the towering form of an Allosaurus . I picked him up by his tail just as the pink sands and emerald palms of his dream-beach were swallowed whole by the rending earth and churning lava of one of Jurassic Earth 's more stunning geological hissy-fits . I let him dangle so that he could get a nice , close look at my dino dentures , even though it meant taking a few physiological liberties with the structure of my forearms . It was a trick that should 've brought the opgods down on me like white on rice , but I 've got more than a little juice with them and they let me have my fun as long as I keep it short and clean up after . <p> " Put me down , you bastard ! " Hoxie squirmed and thrashed , his beady eyes brimming with impotent rodential rage . *Put me down or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * <p> Of course he did n't mean the real Flatbush , as in Brooklyn , as in New York , as in all the way across the country  --  he could n't . What he did mean was the Virtual Flatbush that was the pet project of our beloved Police Commissioner , a guy whose only fault was watching too many old black-and-white cop flicks as a pup . Virtual Flatbush started out as a game , but he made it so exquisitely detailed , so extraordinarily authentic , so damned good that the opgods gave it permanent status on the net and gave him a cyberlord 's say in what happened there . <p> Soon as word got around , it became the primo scene for singles who wanted mates from their own ethnic groups , but who did n't dare say so out loud in realtime for fear of being tagged Politically Incorrigible . It also evolved into a handy penalty box for cops who had n't broken any actual rules , but who had cheesed their bosses a time too many . The luckless saps who got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just why they used to call us " flatfoot . " I could put up with the aching feet and I could tolerate the persistent , all-pervasive smell of simulated gefilte fish , but there was no way I was going to say " Faith an ' begorrah " every time I wanted to start a sentence . <p> I put Hoxie down . <p> " So what 's the case ? " I asked . I shipped my Allosaurus form bye-bye and restored Hoxie 's beach . I even tweaked myself into the seeming of a nubile Jamaican waitress , bearing drinks that resembled a bad explosion at Carmen Miranda 's favorite hat shop . The only thing that glowed more brightly than those tall tumblers full of rum-'n ' - roughage was the warning bleeper over my nametag . I made sure Hoxie got a good , close look at it when I bent over to hand him his drink , just so he could see I was sticking to the rules . It 'd be just like him to give me the Flatbush flush over a technicality . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by being an anal-retentive nitpicker . He took his time checking out the bleeper . Either that , or he was checking out my cleavage , the rat . I subvoc 'd a prayer to the opgods and without warning the bleeper bloomed to five times its original size , thwacking Hoxie 's snout good and hard . <p> " Sorry , mon , " I said , keeping a straight face . " Thought you could n't see it that small . " <p> Hoxie rubbed his nose with his paws . *You 're a weirdo , Knightly , you know that ? What 're you trying to prove ? * <p> " Just trying to do you a favor , sir , " I replied smoothly . " Remember , next year the Olstead Act goes into effect . I would n't want to have my beloved captain brought up on sexual harassment charges just because he could n't keep his beady little eyes off a woman 's bosoms , even if that woman is a man . " I tapped my bleeper to underscore my point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Not Client 's Authentic Gender ! for anyone to see . <p> *Goddam lawyers. * Hoxie 's impressive incisors ground together . Everyone in the precinct knew his opinion of the Olstead Act . It was just the same as his opinion of the previous body of legislation that had brought bleepers into existence . According to him , they 'd taken all the fun out of virtual reality when they forced the opgods to slap those pesky little VR truth-tellers onto anyone walking the web . He flopped back down into his beach chair and took a long pull at his drink . *It 's censorship , that 's what it is , Big Brother and a whole bunch of cyber sob sisters who ca n't hack the net solo , so Mommy 's got ta hold their weensy , wussy little hands . Ruin it for all of us , the weenies. * <p> " Hey , vox populi , vox dei , " I told him . " You should 've e-mailed your congressoid if you did n't want it to pass . " <p> *Assholes want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my Latin . He would n't recognize a Classical allusion if it bit him on the a posteriori. *First they make us wear these things so there 's no effing doubt about who we really are , then they slop on a whole new law saying we got ta treat each other like what we look like we are too . Shit , talk about confusing. * <p> " Oh , I 'd be grateful if I were you , Hoxie , " I said . " This way if anyone messes with you , you get ' era for assaulting a police officer and cruelty to dumb animals . " <p> *Very funny , Knightly . Ha , ha , ha . Now you think you could maybe cut the comedy and give the taxpayers some service or a change ? * <p> " Sure , soon as you decide to stop pissing and moaning about Olstead and give me the case instead of all this Luddite bullshit . " <p> I tweaked myself into my preferred shape for business-as-usual , the seeming by which all my best contacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , six foot two , blond hair , blue eyes , perfect teeth , and one hundred ninety supple pounds of muscle . The bleeper above the breast pocket of my white linen planter 's jacket used a discreet yet legible scale to show where this seeming ranked on the Warners ' Aesthetic Index as compared to my true face and body . ( Truth to tell , there was n't all that much distance between them , and what there was , was on account of my real teeth . Those taffy apples will get you every time . ) I summoned myself a second beach chair and sat down , a gin-and-bitters in my hand . " Spill . " <p> Hoxie gave me the whole story . I 'd been hoping for a challenge , after the big buildup he 'd been giving me , a change from the same-old-same-old , but this did n't sound like it . Someone had shown up on the web sans bleeper , and this someone was too slick for any of the regular topicops to apprehend . It happens . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks every cyberrule comes with a codicil that reads This Does Not Mean You . <p> It 's always the smart ones , big surprise , the ones who grew up so brilliant that their parents had to wear mirrorshades just to read their report cards . I do n't care how many sludge-slices of Geraldo you 've seen , parents are still human . They brag about their brainy offspring . Nothing wrong with them being proud of their kids , but I say if they 're going to brag about them to other parents , they ought to do it in real small doses . They do n't . <p> So what happens ? The parents they brag to come down hard on their own kids with the ever-popular Why ca n't you be as smart as Norbert ? riff . I know it 'll come as a shock to you , but this does not make the little sprats burst into cheery can-do grins and reply " Why , thank you , Mumsy and Daddy , that was really all I needed to hear to make me stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself to a life of algebra and celibacy . " No , it has other results . <p> Result number one : The not-so-bright kids make a unilateral decision about who 's at fault for this new crop of parental nagging . Uh-huh : Norbert . Poor tyke gets the heart teased out of him ( and the trap pounded ditto ) every chance they get . Or if it 's Norbertina we 're talking about , the only time she gets asked out on dates is when the guy 's been told to bring his grades up or kiss his driving privileges goodbye . Guess who gets kissed goodbye as soon as Mister Wonderful pulls his geometry marks out of the toilet ? <p> Result number two : When Norbert comes home crying , do Mom and Dad figure out that maybe they should ease up on the bragging ? No , they like rubbing their friends ' noses in it , even if it is their offspring . So instead they tell Norbert that the other kids are just jealous and that being smart is the only thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norbert believes them . <p> Result number four : Norbert decides he does n't have to do anything with his life except be smart . This means he bags such trivia as learning how to make friends , dabbling in empathy , having a conversation that is n't a monologue of all his accomplishments , and observing the basic rules of personal hygeine . Rules are for people who only got B 's in Advanced Calculus . If you 're smart enough to slip around the law , it does n't apply to you . <p> Hey , Norbert , I 've got a newsflash for you : This is America , where it does n't matter how smart you are , the law applies to everyone . <p> Unless you 're rich . Or a celebrity . Preferably both . <p> Hoxie scrolled me an update on this particular Norbert against the background of the tropical sunset . Over ten thousand complaints filed , and that was just in the Central LA area . There was reason to believe that our man ( if he was a man ) was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *It 's spooky , how fast and how far this perp 's gone , * Hoxie said . *The first complaints started coming in yesterday , and now look ! * <p> Yeah , the complaints . They looked like The Usual too : misrepresentation of interpersonal intentions with linked implied long-term emotional commitment . In other words , L-O-V-E . How can one little word cause so much trouble ? Love fouls the net worse than a rogue nanosquid . Everybody 's looking for it , everybody wants it , and everybody 's mighty miffed when they discover that the sweet thang they 've been spending precious online minutes to impress turns out not to be the answer to their passionate prayers but  --  well  --  Norbert . <p> And then there was Part Two , because without Part Two the whole thing was a case for Dear Abner , not the LA(VR)PD : Alienation of personal resources . That 's theft , to you . Not the kind of theft where someone lifts your wallet or your TV or your truck  --  we 've got separate sections of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Virtual larceny , where you 're stripped bare as a boiled bone , only you do n't know it until you log on . <p> Hoxie looked grim . You did n't have to explain cyber theft to him . When the last Mrs. Hoxie packed up and went East , she did n't bother filing for a fat community property settlement , she just hacked into his personal area in the ' scape and cleaned it out to the walls . I was there when he logged on the first time after she left . He did n't suspect a thing . <p> " She said she did n't want anything from me , just her freedom , " he said , smirking . " Man , I made out like a bandit . C'm on over to my place , Knightly , and we 'll celebrate . I just built up an authentic replica of the Baths of Caracalla , complete with slave girls . You 've never seen anything like it . " <p> And I never did . When we got on , it was into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no slave girls , not even a hole to flop into and die . It was pitiful . You could 've heard Hoxie 's scream all the way to Long Beach . We took it to the opgods , but they said that there was no law forbidding anyone with access to a specific area from offloading said area or portion of same . <p> There still is n't . I love you , darling , give me access to your area , says Norbert , and Norbert 's mark complies . Then Norbert moves in , latches onto a big slice of virtual real estate , and annexes it to his own holdings . Holdings , need we add , to which Norbert 's mark has no access . ( " He was going to give me access , but he ran into a system glitch that could n't be fixed until Monday . That 's what he told me , anyway , and he was sooooo sincere that I  --  " Yeah , yeah . Been there , mopped up after that . ) <p> It was n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the sheer volume . No matter how hungry for love you are , no one jumps into it headfirst . All of our other online robber barons had to work on it for months before anyone swore out a complaint against them . It takes time to chat up a potential mark , even for the most skilled of netcrawlers . This is LA : Trust no one , question everything , and you can always watch X-Files re-runs if you ca n't get a date . <p> " How long 's he been at it ? " I asked . As soon as the gender-specific pronoun left my virtual lips , our shared ' scene bleeper posted a self-righteous Attention ! Client 's Antiquated Patriarchocentric Diction in No Way Implies Disrespect Toward or Oversight of Women . <p> *I told you , since yesterday. * <p> " No , you told me the first complaints started coming in yesterday . I want to know when this bullchip artist began trolling for lonely hearts . If I can get a handle on that , it narrows down my field of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty . *That 's just it , Knightly : The perp started operating sometime Sunday morning and by Sunday afternoon we were up to our asses in e-mail from all the jojos he 'd transduced and abandoned . What 's more , our trackers say that this guy  --  * Again the ' scene bleeper went off ) *  --  was n't even an active account until midnight Saturday. * <p> I let out a long , low whistle of admiration . " That 's one fast worker . Too fast . " <p> *Then maybe you 'd better put on a little speed too. * <p> I became a genie , complete with lamp , the lamp complete with warning label stating that this form was a registered fantasy archetype and in no way implied the user 's ability to fulfill anyone 's wishes nor did it intentionally demean those ethnic groups from whose folklore it was derived . I bowed from a smoky waist and said , " Your wish is my command . " <p> *A simple , " Yes , sir " will do , wiseass. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberately wobbly , two-story high YES SIR out of sand and winked out of Hoxie 's area before the whole thing collapsed on the rat , beach chair and all . <p> I let myself drop through the strands of the net until I reached my regular hangout . It was a shabby office right out of an old noir flick , complete with whiskey bottles in the desk 's drawers and zaftig secretary trying to get into mine . Raymond Chandler would 've been proud . I picked up the phone and made a few calls . As soon as the first response came in , I winked out of the office and into the alleyway where Mugsy was waiting . <p> Mugsy sat on top of one of the battered trash cans , a rotting herring in his mouth . <p> " Looking good , Mugsy , " I said , scratching him behind the ears . <p> He spat out the herring and took a swipe at me with his claws . " Save it , Knightly . " Unlike Hoxie 's persnickety personal no-talking-animals rule , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alley cat . " I look like hell , thanks to you . " Nothing wrong , that is , except the alley cat part . <p> " Hey , I paid you for the information on the Salazar case . It 's not my fault you stepped on some toes to get it . " <p> " But it is your fault for not telling me that Salazar was a Northridge Rawhead . " The cat growled deep in his throat . " A Rawhead with connections . Now I got ta lay low in this seeming until the heat 's off . " <p> " So I made a mistake . I had faulty information . I thought Kaminski wiped the Rawheads off the map . " <p> The cat said a word I would n't use to a dog . " The day you got faulty info is the day I sprout feathers . " <p> " You did that already . Last year for Mardi Gras , remember ? And as far as where you sprouted them  --  " <p> " Oh , shut up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of work , Knightly , you know that ? You do n't care who you use or what happens to ' em after you use ' em , as long as you crack your case . You got a heart in there or just a motherboard ? " <p> " Wait , I 'll check , " I said dryly , reaching my hand into my chest and yoinking out a red satin-covered , lace-trimmed box of Valentine 's Day chocolates . I opened it and held it out so Mugsy could see what was inside . <p> The cat 's eyes got big as he scoped the mouth-watering assortment of personal area enhancement scenarios . Long before I joined the force , I used to make ' em for a hobby . I still do , only now it 's on the muni tab . The department does n't give me a big budget to work with , but I 'm one cop who knows how to make the most of my allotted toys . Details , that 's the key : If you 've got a mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turn it into something special . Most people are content if their VR ' scapes just look pretty , but I know how to program the fullest scope of sensory experiences into the tightest space . Engrave the Lord 's Prayer on the head of a pin ? Man , I could engrave it on the point , virtually speaking . <p> And that was my stock-in-trade when dealing with snitches . You do n't win a snitch 's help with dirty old money . A good snitch does n't need money . It 's not cheap running an account at this level . The low rollers stick to the web 's surface , like the mayflies they are . Down here , in the chips carries two meanings , and anyone as deep into the net as me  --  or should I say me as duly ordained representative of the LA(VR)PD ?  --  has money to burn . You have to buy their cooperation with something else . <p> Mugsy raised one trembling paw and reached for a scenario featuring the Amazon rainforest and a pair of statuesque identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized just how many levels of sensual input I had programmed into that bonbon . Mugsy knew , and he was aching . I slammed the box shut before he could touch it . " You know the rules , pal . First we talk business . " <p> He kept staring at the closed box , as if he could will it open . He even tried a few break-and-enters but I brushed them off . " Come on , Mugsy , I do n't have all run . Ten to one you know what I want and where I can find it . Hand it over and you 'll be up to your loins in nubile lutefisk before you can say meow . " <p> Mugsy looked up at me . <p> I sighed and rolled my eyes . " Tell me where I can hook up with the Interfacing Bandit and you get the Lundborg twins ASAP . " <p> Mugsy sang pretty . When he was done , I grinned and patted him on the head . " You done good , kid . Open wide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . He closed his eyes in bliss . My fantasies melt in your mouth , not in your hands . Or paws . Or whatever . Then he vanished , in search of the unplumbed reaches of the Amazon , but not before I winked out too . <p> I came through the net in a swirl of silvery bubbles . All around me , multicolored fish swooped and darted on the currents playing around the great coral reef . As soon as I made splashdown , I knew that dis mus ' be da place . Good old Mugsy . In the world of netcrime , knowing where to jump the strand is half the battle . My quarry might seem to be in hundreds of places at once , but the web 's got millions of sites . A snitch 's most useful function is telling his patron just where to go . <p> Nice place , too . The water was the most perfect cerulean blue , even though we were deep enough into the net for me to need a diving helmet . It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virt up a set of gills easy as breathing . This helmet was for protection of a more practical kind . <p> The Norberts of this world are funny critters : When you catch one with his hands in the cookie jar , he 'll come along quietly and take his spanking without too much fuss . Sometimes you catch one who fusses because he does n't get his spanking soon enough to suit him . ( We generally turn those cases over to Kaminski and do n't ask too many questions after . ) <p> But sometimes  --  and this is what separates the webdicks from the wannabes  --  you find one that fights back . <p> I 've been in a few down-and-uglies with Norberts turned nasty . If I had scars , I 'd show ' em to you . Truth is , I could show ' era , but it would n't be wise . They 're all hung up pretty in a closet far at the back of my most private online area where access is failsafed to keep out everyone but me . When things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be nice to see some real action , I go there to let those castoff seemings talk some sense into me . I take ' em out of the closet one by one and look at the gaping holes , the shattered skulls , the little bags full of goop that used to be me . <p> Memento mori , baby . The jerk on the street thinks that VR 's all dressup and pretend , no one gets hurt , not really . Shows what he knows . Every time you take a hit in VR that 'd kill you offline , you get booted from the web and you ca n't go back on until you play Mother , May I ? with the opgods . What 's more , you can never resume the seeming that got offed . It 's all part and parcel of the Spelling-Peckinpaugh Agreement , a law they rammed through I.N.O. ( International Netwardens ' Olympus , home of the opgods ) when it looked like a lot of juveniles were starting to believe that death was just a temporary inconvenience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in X-Men comic books . <p> Acts have consequences , even virtual acts . Goodbye does n't mean the same thing as See you later . Hell of a tough lesson to teach even when you 're surrounded by examples , made even tougher by teens who think they 're immortal anyhow . <p> Cowards die a thousand times before their deaths . So do webdicks . Only difference is we feel every one of those thousand deaths when it happens . The more authentic a seeming we can call up , the more authentic the pain when some Norbert takes it down . And then there 's the little matter of TruDeth . <p> They do n't talk about TruDeth out there , up near the surface , where the web 's kept nice and shiny for the weekend browsers . They do n't even breathe the word in all the action scenies  --  Net Ninjas ; Fatal Download ; Chip-Chip , Bang-Bang  --  just show some greased-up muscleboy knocking over quad-encryptions like they were playing cards . <p> They never show you Mel . <p> Mel was my friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us were just starting out on the force . Mel was smart ; he made webdick while I was still trying not to shoot myself in the foot with a new personal enhancement device . Whenever the Norhefts heard Mel was on their case , they dropped over the edge of the web like a horde of electronic lemmings . <p> Until one Norbert got just a little smarter than Mel , and a whole lot luckier , and zapped him with a virus when he was n't looking . Now Mel 's still in the net , but his body 's in perpetual care back at Cedars-Sinai . They can keep it going only not forever ; not on a webdick 's medbennies . They wo n't let him die  --  not with the lawbirds circling  --  they 'll simply do the bare minimum to keep him breathing . And there 's no law that says they have to keep him hooked into the net once his autopay account stops covering his online time . Every so often I pass the hat to keep Mel connected , but lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they 're thinking : Why postpone the inevitable ? And so the day 's not far off when , even if Mel finally does untangle himself from that virus and find his way back home , he 'll discover he 's still cut off from his body forever . That 's TruDeth for you . <p> I decided that was n't going to happen to me . Not on this case . Not on my salary . The diving helmet was attached to a deepsea suit that was a solid mesh of antivitals . Maybe it would slow my response times some , but slow is always better than dead . <p> I surveyed the scene . A fresh cloud of fish shimmied across my field of vision . Vermillion seaweed did the hoochy-koo . Despite my protective shell , I allowed for remote sensations , like ambient temperature and how the water would smell and feel if I were into full immersion . Like I said , the opgods are crazy for details , and whose work the opgods admire , him they save the butt thereof . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the shadows of the coral reef , her glimmering fishtail churning the water , her long , black hair flowing out in a silken banner behind her . A mermaid , huh ? Pretty common fantasy , I was expecting something more ambitious out of this perp . Still , I guess that when your goal is to lure in as many marks as fast as possible , you do best by sticking to the oldies . Nobody ever went broke playing to the lowest common denominator . <p> Anyhow , it was a damn fine mermaid , her breasts full and bare , her flexible fishtail promising all manner of slithery delights . Despite the initial distance between us , I sensed the intoxicating perfume of willing femininity just as if we 'd been pressed together in an elevator car . <p> I altered my diving suit slightly . No sense trying to crack a case with your mind on more  --  ah  --  constricting distractions . <p> She sighted me and swam nearer , her eyes sparkling with interest . She wore no bleeper  --  I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't matter . I was in love . Yeah , she was that good . No wonder she 'd racked up so much carnage among the online lovelorn . Near as I could figure , it had to be something about her scent . Virtual pheromones ? Nothing I 'd ever heard of before , but something I 'd give a pretty penny to learn more about . She and I were going to have a long geektalk about it as soon as I performed the service that the good taxpayers of LA expected of me . If I could n't be in love and still take care of business , I 'd be one hell of a sorry webdick . <p> My own bleeper was on . I had to wear it  --  that 's the law  --  but it would n't spook her off . Sure , it said I was an LA(VR)PD webdick  --  that 's the law , too  --  only no law says it could n't display that info in Cretan Linear B , or that the bleeper itself could n't be small enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my diving suit . The opgods know we do n't have an easy job , and they know how to stretch the rules . <p> At first we just sized each other up . She swam around me in smaller and smaller circles until I could feel the edge of her tail hiss over my diving suit . The scent grew stronger with each circuit . She was smiling . I waited for her to say something , to think something . Until she made her move , I could n't run her in , and if I said something first I had to be real careful it was n't anything a hotshot lawbird could sink his beak into as entrapment . <p> I felt her hands on my helmet . She wrapped her whole lissome body around me and peered into the faceplate . I forced myself to look nervous , playing the part of a too young , too rich , too nerdy kid who had n't been this close to a woman since Mommy . In other words , easy meat . My fake adolescent anxiety seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands down the sides of my helmet as if caressing my cheeks . It felt nice . <p> The sea around us was crackling with hormones . All the fish had skedaddled long since . I did a quick and quiet seal-off of the area so she would n't have a bolthole to her name once we got down to business . <p> I gave her a full dose of the big ol ' soulful blues and said , in a voice designed to put across just the right hint of quavery teen lust , " Wow ! Nice seeming . You 're  --  you 're beautiful . Can we , um , chat ? " <p> Her teeth showed sharp and white and perfect . " About what ? " she replied . " Netcrime ? " And she kissed me right on the lips . Then she was gone . <p> So was I. The undersea paradise blinked out from around me . I was flat on my back  --  if that was my back  --  lost in a world of formless gray . I reached out for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groped in the void . Laughter surrounded me , sweet and mocking . My lips still tingled from that kiss . That kiss which I 'd felt full on my mouth despite faceplate and diving helmet and all the safeguards I 'd mounted between us ! <p> *Surprised , Knightly ? * <p> The gray receded . I felt cold earth under me , and the sharp stab of withered grasses . I sat up slowly , the links of my chainmail shirt grinding out a loud protest . I was on a desolate hillside , a worn battle lance beside me , its pennon little more than a rag . My clothes were tattered and smelly ; nothing as nice as her smell , either . There was a thick layer of dirt under my fingernails , as if I 'd been trying to burrow into the hill with my bare hands . <p> Before I could wonder what it all meant , I heard her laugh again . She was a little downslope from me , standing on the lake , wearing what looked like a choirboy 's robe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of white samite , Knightly , you clod , " she announced . I had n't said anything , she 'd simply scooped my reaction to her clothing out of my mind without a by-your-leave . " Arthurian retro-chic , not that you 'd appreciate it . Do n't you read anything but users ' manuals ? " <p> " I read you pretty good , dollface , " I snarled . " What is all this ? " <p> " Oh , do you like it ? " She put on a dimpled simper fake as a preacher 's promise . <p> " Yeah , I 'm crazy for it . I ca n't wait to get my hands on the recipe . I 'll bet you 've got a unicorn stashed on the other side of this hill . " <p> " Only if you want one . They love virgins . " <p> " Forget it , sister . " I stood up and a shot of pain went right through my bones . It was like I 'd spent the night on the cold hillside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was aching . " What I want is right in my reach . It 's over . I know who you are and what you 've been up to . You can come quietly or we can do this the hard way . " <p> " Are n't you forgetting something , Knightly ? " She still had the long black hair , only now it was done back into a braid that fell over one shoulder and right between her breasts , gleaming like the tar on the freeway to heaven . " You ca n't arrest me ; I have n't committed any crime . We never even got to the point where I 'd ask you for access to your private areas and then I 'd go in and annex them to mine . " <p> " Hold it , hold it ! " I tapped my bleeper and enlarged it so the perp could n't help but see the embedded badge icon . If she felt like singing , I was going to get it all down for the record , nice and legal . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream , saturating the site with the Miranda Act in every officially recognized Angelino language including gangslang , visually and verbally , with automatic notification dispatched to the media and the local ACLU node . Even when you 're in the net , you 've got to make your busts by the book . " Okay , keep talking . " <p> She shrugged . " What 's to talk ? I said I never got around to doing it . " <p> " Not to me , maybe , but  --  " <p> " Prove I did it to anybody , Norbert , " she sneered . <p> That name . My name for all the sorry saps who spent their lives with one hand on the keypad and the other in their ... noses . The name I 'd never told to another living soul . <p> My name . My given name . Back in the bad old days when I was as solidly welded to the silicon tit as the next getalffe , the days before I saw my parents ' credit rating mercilessly gunned down during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norbert Knightly , boy blob , super-cyber-genius . All that changed when Dad 's data took that fatal hit in a blip-by dumping . No more online time for little Norbert then . No more hiding from the world in the web , swapping emoticons with my fellow yingtongs and pretending that nothing else mattered but being brainiacs . <p> Norbert Knightly was dead . So was anyone who tried to bring him back . My vision went red . I picked up the lance and aimed it at her , but it was meant for jousting , not throwing , and it was n't going to do me much good without a horse . <p> " Oh , by all means , allow me , " she said . <p> I was suddenly a good five feet off the ground on the back of a white charger , my lance in my hand . I just sat there , too stunned to move . Once more she 'd seemingly plucked the thoughts right out of my head . No one can do that on the net , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wire all the way back into your brain and go window shopping . Who was this creature ? What was she ? For the first time in my professional life , I was afraid . <p> " Well ? " she taunted . " I 'm waiting . What 's the matter ? Afraid ? Not Blaze Knightly ! Not the webdick 's webdick , the opgods ' darling ! Come on , I 've given you everything you need to destroy me . Do n't worry about the lawbirds : I 've taken the liberty of locking in a shunt scenario . If they try to find out what happened in this sector , they 'll see you slapping the cuffs on me and escorting me off the web . If they bother doing a followup , they 'll find the records of my trial , conviction and imprisonment . So ? . This is the chance you 've been waiting for all your life , the chance to obliterate one of the worst webscum you 'll ever meet . Do it ! Do it now ! " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parted the folds of her robe wide . The space between her breasts shone like a nova . <p> I felt the horse begin to move forward , though I had n't done a thing to encourage him . He went from a walk to a trot to a canter , then hit the gallop before I could blink . I was holding the lance couched real pretty , from force of habit . Time was , I used to rack up major online time playing Merlin 's Mall ( The Game of Chivalrous Shopoholics ) , when often the only thing standing between you and the 75% Off Electronics sale was a joust against the Black Knight . I knew how to use a lance , all right . <p> But what good would it do ? Was she just going to stand there and let me take her down ? No way . It would n't be that easy ; it could n't be . Had she brought me this far , sitenapped me , showed me she had more power in VR than I could imagine , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trap . It had to be a trap . As soon as my lance made contact , I 'd be the one zapped into the never-never . The horse was really covering ground now . I groped for the reins , wanting to slow him : No reins . I tried using my knees to turn him : No luck . I dropped the lance  --  that is , I tried to drop the lance . My arms were rigid , paralyzed , my fingers set in a death grip as the horse bore me inexorably down on my target . Only I knew the real target was me . <p> So this is how it ends , I thought . As soon as this lance touches her , I 'm hit with a shot of virus that 'll make what happened to Mel look like a light sneeze . Sure wish I 'd sprung for the auxiliary medbennie policy now . Oh , well , TruDeth , here I come . <p> *STOP ! * <p> The word boomed out and echoed on every level the ' scape could provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and in the gut and in places that are none of your damned business . It filled the sky over me and became the earth under me and did things to the local property values you would n't believe . My horse vanished , my lance melted , and I hit the ground standing firm . <p> I looked at the perp . She was as dumbstruck as me . She was staring down the front of her robe at the glowing mass between her breasts , the ultimate source of the word of power that had put the kibosh on her evil schemes . " Darling ? " she said uncertainly to her cleavage . ( No argument there from me . ) <p> *She does n't mean it , she means me. * the glow said . *Jeez , Blaze , you ever gon na grow up ? * <p> My mouth fell open like a Vuitton knockoff suitcase . " Mel ? " <p> The glow chortled . *In something not quite resembling the flesh . Hiya , Blaze . Long time no interface. * <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been milking the marks for their virtual real estate ? " And then , in afterthought : " You 're the one who almost got me killed in here ? " <p> ' Oh , pshaw , that was n't my idea . Anyway , I stopped her before it went too far . * <p> " Then why  --  ? What  --  ? " I walked closer  --  staggered , more like it  --  and seized her by the shoulders . " Mel , what 's happened to you ? " I shouted , shaking her violently . <p> She smacked me across the face and backed off , glaring . " You do n't get it , do you , Knightly ? " she snarled . <p> The glow between her breasts made a tsk-tsk sound and added , ' She 's not Mel . I 'm Mel . And you may be my pal and former partner , but I 'll thank you to keep your mitts off my fiancee . ' <p> " Your ... fiancee , " I repeated as my knees buckled under me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet you , " she said , making sure I knew she was n't . She offered me her hand . 1 took it , and slipped into nightmare . <p> I was falling through space , engulfed by a dazzling display of light and color that would shame any " twinkle " trip . Below me I saw I.N.O. , shining with the compounded brilliance of the opgods , and then , off in the distant reaches of the void , a dark , amorphous mass creeping nearer , swallowing up the lesser lights that were the big online accounts , heading straight for I.N.O. <p> *You know me , Blaze , * Mel 's consciousness invaded me. *I always wanted a mate who knew her . own mind . Looks like I found the ultimate in spunky little vixens , huh ? * <p> " I  --  I do n't understand . " <p> *What she wants , friend , is to clean house . You ever scope the net ? The whole net ? Nah , how could you ? Just take my word for it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any yingtong with the price of a visor comes barging into VR like he owns the joint . Pretty soon he 's butting headsets with some other trolls , scrambling the ' scene , messing up some nice sites , then going home again like nothing happened . Tourists ! The topicops do their best , but they ca n't be everywhere , and the opgods are no help at all . They think this is their turf , and if they can get rich off the paying customers , they 're not going to listen to a resident 's complaint . So we decided to give them some complaints they 'd have to hear. * <p> The glow bloomed back into my range of vision as Mel added , *This is our home , and if the opgods wo n't acknowledge that and make the tourists respect it , then we 'll keep fleecing the marks out of their personal areas until it 's all ours again . That includes I.N.O.* <p> I gazed at the encroaching cloud of dark matter . " You 've got hooks in some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you. ? She 's good. * <p> " And fast , " I muttered . " How could she work so  --  ? " <p> And then I knew ; I knew who Mel 's fiancee really was . The answer had been there all along . How else could she have broken through my safeguards , jerked me through cyberspace so easily , known my thoughts , fallen for someone like Mel who could never have a life offline ? All that , plus scoring that impressive list of consumer complaints in such a short timespan . Not even the greatest chipjockey of all time could do that . No one could do that . You 'd have to be everywhere in the net at once . <p> You 'd have to be the net . <p> A cigar boinked itself into being between my lips . Cyberspace was yanked from under me like a doormat and I was back on the hillside . This time I found myself on a checkered tablecloth , a picnic basket at my elbow . The lady sat across from me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere glow , but looked much the way I remembered him , only with better teeth . He had his arm around her . <p> She gave me a look of grudging admiration and a tuna fish sandwich . " Good dickwork , Knightly , " she said . <p> " Thanks , uh ... " What do you call the single most powerful entity in the Virtual universe ? <p> " Call me Bitsy . " I hadda ask . <p> So that was it . All those years , all those amateur fantasies , all those cyberdabblers had pissed in the net once too often ; now Bitsy was calling them on it . And when Bitsy called , we 'd all have to listen . It looked like the end of VR as we knew it . <p> Hoxie out on the streets bothering real women. / Kaminski with nothing but time and that Richard Simmons tape on his hands ? Nuh-uh . Not if I could help it . <p> " You know , most of us are n't so bad , " I told Bitsy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but how about the good guys . Ever come across a ' scape that made you smile. /Ever fallen into an online love sonnet that made your nodes tingle ? And besides , if it was n't for human presence online , you never would 've met Mel . " <p> " Mmm , " said Bitsy , looking thoughtful . <p> And that Mmm was the sliver that became the wedge that let me open her mind and persuade her to ease up on us poor mortal oiks . It took time , but the way Bitsy processed data , everything was settled before you could say EdMat . She returned all the areas she 'd annexed in exchange for the opgods ' promise to make the VR rules a little stricter , the access a little tougher , and the penalties for not cleaning up after yourself a whole lot uglier . Sure , we 're gon na have a few Norb  --  scofflaws trying to get around the rules , but nothing the topicops ca n't handle . Not with Bitsy there to help them . Case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hoxie happy  --  <p> Me ? Was I happy. /Well ... <p> Let 's just say that I got a lot more out of this case than a promotion and a flashy equipment upgrade . See , after we worked out our differences , Bitsy took kind of a shine to me . It was mutual . Mel 's not the only one who likes his females bright and spunky , and if the net is n't woman or man , or miscellaneous ) enough for more than one significant other , who is ? <p> Mel does n't mind . He says it 's nice that we 're partners again . He 's even slapped on a seeming that matches my noir office , and Bitsy sometimes pops in to play secretary . I 'll let you in on a secret : We did n't hire her for her typing skills . <p> Maybe pixels are no substitute for passion , but so far they do me just fine . Once a Norbert , always a Norbert , I guess . <p> Hey , you know the old saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put that down . <p> <p> By Esther M. Friesner <p>
