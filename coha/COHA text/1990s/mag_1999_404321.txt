0N R0AD Next to having your bike stolen , it 's every cyclist 's greatest fear an accident with a car . But before we go any further , take a deep breath and relax : A mere 20% of cycling mishaps involve an automobile . This means 80% of the time we 're our own worst enemy , so keep your eyes up the road , watch for obstacles , and maintain a relaxed posture . Alert riding is the best accident prevention strategy of all . Another reality check : 90% of car/bike accidents occur at or near intersections , according to a study by Bill Hunter at the University of North Carolina Safety Research Center . Using Hunter 's data as a guideline ( and our own hair-raising experiences with autos ) , we came up with some strategies to help you avoid the most common car/bike accident types . All these strategies are based on one simple , effective premise : Cyclists do best when they act as the drivers of vehicles . STRATEGY : Position yourself where motorists automatically look-in the flow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intersection by riding in the center of the traffic lane that 's closest to the edge of the road ( which is your legal right , by the way ) . Never cower at the extreme edge of the road , where you 're less visible to cars . The same si helps prevent an overtaking motorist from passing you only to make a rg turn in your path . Riding in the flow forces right-turning motorists to wait behind you . STRATEGY : Do n't play scofflaw or ine that you 're somehow above the law . In every state , cyclists have the right , and responsibilities of a motor vehicle , and for good reason : It helps prevent accidents . So heed stop signs and lights . Most cyclists find that a slow rolling stop that allows a good glance in each direction is best Why ? A complete stop means that you 'll begetting into the section , thus more vulnerable . Keeping both feet on the pedals allows for quick acceleration through and danger spots . OFF ROAD While the causes of cycling accidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for so many reasons that no systematic study has attempted to document them . Research has been conducted on what injuries commonly occur off-road , but not what riding mistakes are the cause of them . For most of us , it does n't take much time on dirt to experience most varieties of " gravity storms " but sometimes it 's hard to figure out what you did wrong . So we went to the people who know , the coaches at Dirt Camp , a mountain bike instructional camp ( 800/711-3478 , CO ; www.dirtcamp.com ) . As the instructors shepherd their charges through drills and rides , they 've seen most of the ways riders fall over-and what to do about them . STRATEGY : Ever Photograph <p>
