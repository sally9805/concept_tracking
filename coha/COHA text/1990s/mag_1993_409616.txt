Losing the presidency may have been a blow to George Bush 's ego , but it has done wonders for his golf game . After years of futile effort , says Ken Raynor , the pro at Cape Arundel Golf Club in Kennebunkport , Me. , the former President has at last mastered the " short little chip shot  --  a shot that takes delicacy and finesse . " The key to his new stroke is not just the time he has for practice these days . " He used to have a lot of tension in his hands , " says Raynor . " You need to be relaxed to do this shot , and now he 's relaxing more on the golf course . " And that 's not the only place , thank you . Six months after being evicted from the White House , George Bush , 69 , and wife Barbara , 68 , who have been splitting their time between Houston and their summer residence in Kennebunkport , seem to be basking in the pleasures of private life . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public life , you 're wrong , " said the former President during a charity appearance in Portland , Me. , last month . Not that the transition has n't taken any effort . After years of being chauffered everywhere she went , for instance , the former First Lady recently renewed her Texas driver 's license so she could take the wheel of the family 's new Mercury Sable station wagon . " Look out , " she warned , " I 'm driving again . " But if the Bushes appear supremely content , they have n't exactly slowed the frenetic pace of their White House years . " My mom and dad 's definition of retirement will always be different than the traditional view , " says son Marvin , 36 , a businessman . " My dad 's idea of a relaxing day is fishing for three hours , jogging for thirty minutes , playing tennis and golf and then maybe reading a book and watching a movie . " Lately much of the Bushes " attention has been focused on repairing storm damage to their vacation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upscale West Oaks section of Houston . The Texas home , which is due to be finished by October , is comfortable but hardly lavish by local standards . The Bushes , who in the meantime have been renting a smaller place two doors away , have done their best to fit into the neighborhood . In March they were invited to a covered-dish party thrown by local resident Hank Rush , who had never met them before . " It was really kind of exciting , " says Rush . " You get a lump in your throat when you open your front door and there they are . " Bar showed up in sneakers , but the Bushes did bring a pricey bottle of Chateau Margeaux as a gift . Though gratified by the Bushes ' lack of pretensions , some neighbors in West Oaks are annoyed by the increased traffic in their once sleepy enclave . The one-way street that winds past the Bush house is now often thick with tourists and gawkers hoping to catch a glimpse of George and Barbara . In response to complaints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special bill to allow the city of Houston to restrict access to the street . Some neighbors have also expressed concerns about security in the wake of the alleged Iraqi plot to assassinate Bush during his visit to Kuwait last April . But Marvin maintains that his father , who has lifetime Secret Service protection , is not unduly worried about terrorism . " Things like that just do n't ruffle him , " he says . " You 're talking about a guy who got shot down overseas during World War II . " Indeed , up in Kennebunkport , the locals have been most surprised by the air of easy informality surrounding the Bushes ' presence this summer . No sooner had the former President arrived in May than he invited local fishermen to troll the waters around the family compound , which had been off-limits to nonofficial craft for the past 12 years . Bush himself spends part of nearly every day zipping over the swells in his cigarette boat Fidelity , searching for bluefish . At night , George and Bar sometimes go out for dinner at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A steady procession of Bush grandkids  --  they have 13 all together  --  have also been coming for visits . Thus , on the eve of the Fourth of July weekend , the former head of the free world went to the Kennebunk Supermarket to stock up on hamburgers , hot dogs , chips , ice cream and soda . He leisurely strolled the aisles for an hour , chatting with other shoppers and signing autographs . " Now he has to do things that regular people do , " says store manager Peter Conforti . " He has to live like everyone else . " Up to a point , of course . Not everyone receives a pension of nearly $150,000 a year and can command a fee of more than $60,000 a speech to air their views as Bush does . The former President is reportedly set to write a book on foreign policy with former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft ; Barbara has reportedly accepted a $2.2 million contract for her memoirs . At the moment , the closest thing Bush has to a day job is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned for Texas A &M; University . Which invites the question , Could any post lure the notoriously restless former President out of retirement ? To hear him reflect on his newfound freedom , not a chance . " I make the coffee , Barbara makes the beds , and we 're right back to square one , where we got married when we were 20 years old , " said Bush a few months ago . " She does the cooking and I do the dishes , and life is absolutely wonderful . " <p>
