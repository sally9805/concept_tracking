##@x <p> After a decade of observing crypto-capitalist " reform " in China , one becomes accustomed to ironies and paradoxes . So I was hardly surprised by a Chinese article on management strategy asserting that good business reputations are " established as a result of a high sense of responsibility and loyalty to consumers in a target market " and that " selling good will means selling quality . " After all , for some time China has issued how-to tracts by budding entrepreneurs that sound more like Dale Carnegie than Mao Zedong . <p> But it was hard to believe that the author of this particular article was a certain Wu Mingliu who was attached to the Sichuan Province Reform Through Labor Police Academy , an institution that trains personnel for China 's vast gulag and that his article had been published in a journal called Theoretical Studies in Labor Reform and Labor Re-education . <p> Recently translated by Asia Watch , this and several companion articles give a glimpse into how officials at the Reform Through Labor camps have borrowed capitalist marketing techniques to break into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ding Banghua , an official of the Jiangsu Province Reform Through Labor Bureau , urged his comrades to struggle against an " inferiority complex " about their work and to to take heart from its " obvious advantages , " namely , the large number of prisoners who have become " commodity producers " and " the sizable community of labor reform enterprises " available for production . Now that the Communist Party 's " policy of reform and openness " has given gulag enterprises " a new vitality , making them more prosperous than ever before , " he says , why not be upbeat ? Indeed , why not ? According to Mr. Ding , production by forced labor in his province has grown by an astounding 18 percent each year since 1983 . <p> He Liang , a young cadet at the Reform Through Labor Police Academy in Sichuan , also stresses the advantages of gulag labor . " We have greater manpower at our disposal , and our workers are young , concentrated and cost less since they follow a military routine , " he declares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't easy . Qin Guishan , an official of a textile mill , notes that " convicts working in a labor reform factory are not the masters of the enterprise  --  they are criminals in society . " They have , he admits , " a negative , antagonistic and disruptive side . " <p> But never mind such trifles ! Mr. Qin exuberantly reports that his factory has shipped millions of dollars ' worth of prize-winning blue denim abroad , earning heartwarming " praise from customers in such developed countries as Japan , the U.S. and Germany . " Not only have " many clients , both domestic and foreign , asked for that product by name , " he brags , but the Japanese have even extended a low-interest loan . <p> Does Mr. Qin fear that his mill 's dark secret might be exposed to the world ? Not at all . To avoid the ignominy and , in some cases , illegality of having the goods appear abroad with the labels of a penal institution , Mr. Qin 's factory , like all such camp enterprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspirational one at that : the New Life Cotton Cloth Mill . <p> But inspiration only goes so far . By " instilling into our cadre of police a sense of dictatorship , " continues Mr. Qin , New Life has kept foreign clients unaware of who is making the goods . " We made it an explicit rule that whenever foreign businessmen come to the workshop to inspect product samples for quality , they must be accompanied by a special person , " he explains . " Prisoners are not allowed to have direct contact or talks with foreign businessmen . No secret has ever been leaked , and thus other incidents involving foreign contacts have been prevented from happening . " <p> Then , with a self-congratulatory flourish , Mr. Qin concludes : " Whenever a foreign trade task has been successfully fulfilled , the prisoners are urged to report their accomplishment to their loved ones , thus inspiring them with patriotism and a sense of national pride .

Nor does it stop goods made by forced labor from being exported to the U.S. , in violation of our 1930 Tariff Act . <p> But these articles make sobering reading as our nation once again begins the debate over extending most-favored-nation trade status to China . @@649956 1 . <br> It was July and hot and I was putting out sticks and not thinking one whit about murder . <br> All the other rose-field jobs are bad , the budding , the digging , but putting out sticks , that 's the job they give sinners in Hell . <br> You do sticks come dead of summer . Way it works is they give you this fistful of bud wood , and you take that and sigh and turn and look down the length of the field , which goes on from where you are to some place east of China , and you gird your loins , bend over , and poke those sticks in the rows a bit apart . You do n't lift up if you do n't have to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your back bent and you keep on poking , right on down that dusty row , hoping eventually it 'll play out , though it never seems to , and of course that East Texas sun , which by 10:30 A.M. is like an infected blister leaking molten pus , does n't help matters . <br> So I was out there playing with my sticks , thinking the usual thoughts about ice tea and sweet , willing women , when the Walking Boss came up and tapped me on the shoulder . <br> I thought maybe it was water break , but when I looked up he jerked a thumb toward the end of the field , said , " Hap , Leonard 's here . " <br> " He ca n't come to work , " I said . " Not unless he can put out sticks with his cane . " <br> " Just wants to see you , " the Walking Boss said , and moved away . <br> I poked in the last stick from my bundle , eased my back straight , and started down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sweaty backs of the others as I went . <br> I could see Leonard at the far end of the field , leaning on his cane . From that distance , he looked as if he were made of pipe cleaners and doll clothes . His raisin-black face was turned in my direction and a heat wave jumped off of it and vibrated in the bright light and dust from the field swirled momentarily in the wave and settled slowly . <br> When Leonard saw I was looking in his direction , his hand flew up like a grackle taking flight . <br> Vernon Lacy , my field boss , known affectionately to me as the Old Bastard though he was my age , decked out in starched white shirt , white pants , and tan pith helmet , saw me coming too . He came alongside Leonard and looked at me and made a slow and deliberate mark in his little composition book . Docking my time , of course . <br> When I got to the end of the row , which only took a little less time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was dust covered and tired from trudging in the soft dirt . Leonard grinned , said , " Just wanted to know if you could loan me fifty cents . " <br> " You made me walk all the way here for fifty cents , I 'm gon na see I can fit that cane up your ass . " <br> " Let me grease up first , will you ? " <br> Lacy looked over and said , " You 're docked , Collins . " <br> " Go to hell , " I said . <br> Lacy swallowed and walked away and did n't look back . <br> " Smooth , " Leonard said . <br> " I pride myself on diplomacy . Now tell me it is n't fifty cents you want . " <br> " It is n't fifty cents I want . " <br> Leonard was still grinning , but the grin shifted slightly to one side , like a boat about to take water and sink . <br> " What 's wrong , buddy ? " <br> " My Uncle Chester , " Leonard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leonard 's old Buick in my pickup , stopping long enough along the way to buy some beer and ice . When we arrived at Leonard 's place , we got an ice chest and filled it with the ice and the beer and carried it out to the front porch . <br> Leonard , like myself , did n't have air-conditioning , and the front porch was as cool a spot as we could find , unless we went down to the creek and laid in it . <br> We eased into the rickety porch swing and sat the ice chest between us . While Leonard moved the swing with his good leg , I popped us a couple . <br> " Happen today ? " I asked . <br> " They found him today . Been dead two or three <br> Leonard sipped his beer and studied the barbed-wire fence on the opposite side of the road . " See that mockingbird on the fence post , Hap ? " <br> " Why ? Is he trying to get my attention ? " <br> " He 's a fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> " I wonder about that all the time , Leonard . How come mockingbirds do n't normally get fat . Thought I might write a paper on it . " <br> " My uncle 's favorite bird . I always thought they were ugly , but he thought they were the grandest things in the world . He used to call me his little mockingbird when I was a kid because I mocked him and everybody else . I see one , I think of him . Hokey , huh ? " <br> I did n't say anything . I focused my eyes on the floorboards at the edge of the porch , watched as a hot horsefly staggered on its disease-laden legs , trying to make the little bit of shade the porch roof provided . The fly faltered and stopped . Heatstroke , I figured . <br> " I want to go to Uncle Chester 's funeral tomorrow , " Leonard said . " But I do n't know . I feel funny about it . He probably would n't want me there . " <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of the fact he disowned you when he found out you were queer --  " <br> " Gay . We say gay now , Hap . You straights need to learn that . When we 're real drunk , we call each other fags or faggots . " <br> " Whatever . I 'm sure , in his own way , Chester was a good guy . You loved him . It does n't matter what he would have wanted . What matters is what you want . He 's dead . He 's not making decisions anymore . You want to go to the funeral and tell him ' bye because of the good things you remember about him , go on . " <br> " Come with me . " <br> " Hey , I 'm sorry for Uncle Chester on account of what he meant to you , but I do n't know him from brown rice . Fact is , him dying , you coming around upset , and me leaving the rose fields like that , I figure 1 do n't have a job anymore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would I want to go to his funeral ? " <br> " Because I want you to and you 're my friend and you do n't want to hurt my teeny-weeny feelings . " <br> This was true . <br> I did n't like it , but I agreed . Going to a funeral seemed harmless enough . <br> 2 . <br> Funeral was the next day at three in the afternoon , so early next morning we drove to LaBorde in Leonard 's car and over to J. C. Penney 's . <br> We went there to buy suits , something neither Leonard or I had owned in years . My last suit had had a Nehru collar and a peace symbol about the size of an El Dorado hubcap on a chain a little smaller than you might need to tow a butane truck . <br> Leonard 's last suit had been designed by the military . <br> Suits from Penney 's did n't come with a vest and two pairs of pants anymore , least not the decent ones , and the prices were higher than I remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kmart , see if they had something in sheen green . <br> Something we got tired of wearing , we could use to upholster a chair . <br> I ended up with a dark blue suit and a light blue shirt and a dark blue tie . I bought black shoes , socks , and a belt . I tried the stuff on and looked at myself in the mirror . I thought I looked silly . Like a tall , biped pit bull in mourning . <br> Leonard bought a dark green Western-cut suit , a canary-yellow shirt , and a tie striped up in orange and green and yellow . Shoes he got were black with pointy toes and zippers down the side . Kind of shoes you hoped they stopped making about the time the Dave Clark Five quit making records . <br> " You 're gon na bury Uncle Chester , " I said . " Not take him on a Caribbean cruise . Show up in that , he might jump out of the box and throw a blanket over you . " <br> " Jealousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're right . I wish I looked like a head-on collision between Dolly Parton and Peter Max . " <br> We changed back into our clothes , and I paid up because I was the only one working these days , even if it was sporadically , and because Leonard never let me forger it was my fault his leg was messed up . He 'd say stuff like , " You know I got this leg messed up on account of you , " then he 'd pick something he wanted and I 'd pay for it , because what he said was true . Was n't for him , my funeral would have come before Uncle Chester 's . <br> The services were in a little community on the outskirts of LaBorde , and after we went home and hung our awhile , we put the suits on and drove over in Leonard 's wreck with no air-conditioning . <br> Time we got to the Baptist church where the funeral was being held , we had sweated up good in our new suits , and the hot wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been combed with a bush hog . My overall appearance was of someone who had been in a fight and lost . <br> I got out of the car and Leonard came around and said , " You still got the fucking tag hanging on you . " <br> I lifted an arm and there was the tag , dangling from the suit sleeve . I felt like Minnie Pearl . Leonard got out his pocket knife and cut it off and we went inside the church . <br> We paraded by the open coffin , and of course , Uncle Chester had n't missed his chance to be guest of honor . He was one ugly sonofabitch , and I figured alive he had n't looked much better . He was n't very tall , but he was wide , and being dead a few days before they found him had n't helped his looks any . The mortician had only succeeded in making him look a bit like a swollen Cabbage Patch Doll . <br> After the eulogies and prayers and singing and people falling over the coffin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove out to a little cemetery in the woods and the coffin was unloaded from an ancient black hearse with a sticker on the back bumper that read BINGO FOR GOD . <br> Underneath a striped tent , with the hot wind blowing , we stood next to an open grave and the ceremony went on . There was a kind of thespian quality about the whole thing . The only one who seemed to be truly upset was Leonard . He was n't saying anything , and he 's too macho to cry in public , but I knew him . I saw the way his hands shook , the tilt of his mouth , the hooding of his eyes . <br> " It 's a nice enough place to get put down , " I whispered to Leonard . <br> " You 're dead , you 're dead , " Leonard said . " You told me that . It 's a thing takes the edge off how you feel about your surroundings . " <br> " Right . Fuck Uncle Chester . Let 's talk fashion . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fag Roy Rogers but you . " <br> That got a smile out of him . <br> During the preacher 's generic marathon tribute to Uncle Chester , I spent some time looking at a pretty black woman in a short , tight black dress standing near us . She , like Leonard , was one of the few not trying out for the Academy Awards . She did n't look particularly sad , but she was solemn . Now and then she turned and looked at Leonard . I could n't tell if he noticed . A heterosexual would have noticed if there was anything romantic in her attitude or nor . It ca n't be helped . A heterosexual dick senses a pretty woman , no matter what the cultural and social training of its owner , and it 'll always point true north . Or maybe it 's south , now that I think about it . <br> The preacher finished up a prayer slightly longer than the complete set of the Encyclopedia Britannica and signaled to lower the coffin . <br> A long lean guy with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lever and the coffin started down , wobbled , righted itself . Someone in the audience let out a sob and went quiet . A woman in front of me , wearing a hat with everything on it but fresh fruit and a strand of barbed wire , shook and let our a wail and waved a hanky . <br> A moment later it was all over except for the grave diggers throwing dirt in the hole . <br> There was some hand-shaking and talking , and most of the crowd came over and spoke to Leonard and said how sorry they were , looked at me out of the corners of their eyes , suspicious because I was white , or maybe because they assumed I was Leonard 's lover . It was bad enough they had a relative or acquaintance who was queer , but shit , looked like he was fucking a white guy . <br> We were invited , not with great enthusiasm , to a gathering of friends and family , but Leonard passed , and the crowd faded out . The pretty woman in black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said she was sorry . <br> " I 'm Florida Grange . I was your uncle 's lawyer , Mr. Pine , " she said . " Guess I still am . You 're in the will . I 'll make it official if you 'll come by my office tomorrow . Here 's my card . And here 's the key to his house . You get that and some money . " <br> Leonard took the key and card and stood there looking stunned . I said , " Hello , Miss Grange , my name 's Hap Collins . " <br> " Hello , " she said , and shook my hand . <br> " You know my uncle well ? " Leonard asked . <br> " No . Not really , " Florida Grange said , and she went away , and so did we . <br> Continues ...
