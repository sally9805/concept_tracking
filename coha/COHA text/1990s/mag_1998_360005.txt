The crew of the shuttle Discovery was apparently smart enough to come in out of a storm , returning safely to Earth last Saturday before the Leonid meteor shower could begin . The mission 's glamour boy , however  --  veteran astronaut John Glenn  --  was a bit unsteady , both in orbit and on his return to terra firma . <P> Once described by Jimmy Carter as the most boring man he ever met , Glenn was game enough to risk trading one-liners with Jay Leno Wednesday night , along with shuttle commander Curt Brown and crewman Steve Lindsey . Leno , essentially pitching comedic batting practice to Glenn , tossed a few slow , fat lobs directly over the plate , but Glenn whiffed , responding with a series of jokes  --  including a crack about whether his Senate colleagues would provide enough funding to bring him home  --  that fell more or less flat . It was left to Brown , 42 ( young enough to have spent his late nights watching Carson and Leno , not Allen and Paar ) , to keep things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough it was in the old days ? " Leno asked . <P> " He does n't always do that , " deadpanned Brown . " Only when he 's awake . " Brown went on to enumerate the major landmarks that can be spotted from orbit : " You can see the pyramids from space and sometimes rivers and big airports , and actually , Jay , every time we fly by California , we see your chin . " <P> Leno was not the only one who got orbital schmooze time with the shuttle crew last week . Glenn also took a call from NASA administrator Daniel Goldin , who relayed a blunt message from Glenn 's wife Annie : " You ai n't going up again . " <P> Glenn , never one to sit long on his laurels , seems to have found a way to fill his postorbital time . Once he gets his land legs , he 'll be reporting to literary agent Mort Janklow , who is said to be marketing the astronaut 's memoirs .
