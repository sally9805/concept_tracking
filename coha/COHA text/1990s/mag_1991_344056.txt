The requisite niceties aside , it was not the friendliest audience that Issaias Afewerki faced as he addressed his partners in Ethiopia 's new power elite last week . Many of the others oppose his plan for Eritrean independence , preferring to keep the coastal province firmly within Ethiopia . Issaias had a message for them . " Forget history , " he told the conference in Addis Ababa . " Men make history , and we have made an independent Eritrea . " <P> For the moment , his fellow leaders were willing to go along . Under a charter adopted by the 81 delegates representing 24 different groups , the Eritreans , as well as any of Ethiopia 's dozens of other nationalities , will have the right to self-determination and even secession . The delegates agreed that in two years Eritreans would vote on whether to break away from Ethiopia . Those who oppose the province 's departure are plainly hoping that by then independence will have lost its allure . Within that time , they anticipate , the Eritrean leadership will have failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking . Ever since 1890 , when Italy officially colonized the province , Eritreans have considered themselves more advanced than Ethiopians . Eritrean rebels began fighting for independence in 1961 and since then have done an impressive job of providing health care , education and other services to rural areas under their control . Ethiopia 's dilemma , however , is acute : without Eritrea , the nation of 53 million has no access to the sea . <P> Much can happen in two years . In pursuing its separatist aims , the Eritrean People 's Liberation Front , which Issaias heads , must not antagonize the newly installed government in Addis Ababa , which replaced Mengistu Haile Mariam , the dictator who was deposed in May . Nor can the front afford to alienate the international community on which it depends for famine relief and economic aid . <P> Beyond that , the E.P.L.F. must convert itself from a rebel army to a civilian government that can resuscitate a region devastated by 30 years of war , a land where fields are barren and industries are still . Otherwise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the independence movement this far . As an Eritrean civil servant put it , " We have our independence . That 's good . Now , where are the jobs ? " <P> Despite such worries , the mood in the provincial capital of Asmara , which was retaken by the front in May , is euphoric . Colored lights and miniature blue , green and red E.P.L.F. flags decorate National Avenue , the main thoroughfare . Streets are filled at all hours with people strolling about , many of them fighters promenading hand in hand with loved ones they have not seen in many years . The Italian-style cafes are busy late into the night . " Before , we lived like prisoners here , " says Yohannes Ande , owner of a small convenience store . " You could n't say the word Eritrea . You could n't walk on the sidewalks because of the sandbag bunkers the army put up on almost every corner . It was a dark time . Now it 's going to be good . " <P> That sentiment is not nearly as evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly by Mengistu 's forces . Few buildings remain whole . Children play in the rubble with toys made from tank parts while abandoned Kalashnikovs rust in the hot , humid air . " What are we free from ? " complains Tirhas , 20 , a teacher who would not give her full name .
