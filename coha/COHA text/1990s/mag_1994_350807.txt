" I do n't understand why things ca n't go back to normal at the end of the half-hour , like The Brady Bunch , " one of the kids remarks as a new mini- crisis takes its place beside the last one nobody quite solved . " Because , " someone replies , " Mr. Brady died of AIDS . " <P> The idea that a 1970s sitcom could seem like paradise lost to a bunch of recent college grads looking ( and not looking ) for entry-level jobs while trying to find entry-level understanding of adulthood is a measure of something . The downsizing of American possibilities , maybe . Or the murkiness of American reality as it 's refracted in sound-bite TV and a trashy commercial culture . <P> It may be , of course , that Reality Bites reflects no more than the latest styles in anomie among the young and the restive . But that in itself is a useful service when a lot of movies cater to this crowd but few attempt to understand them unsentimentally . Even fewer are lucky enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> She 's Lelaina , by day a production assistant on a fatuous morning TV show , by inclination a documentary filmmaker , trying to use her pals ' lives and thoughts to make a statement about their generation . She 's an up-and-doing spirit in a down-and-out milieu . <P> Ryder , in turn , is lucky with both script and direction . The former is by Helen Childress , 23 , who not only has a good ear for the sound of her contemporaries but also knows how to shape it into dialogue that is pointed and full of unforced observations . Director Ben Stiller keeps things crisp , no small matter in a movie that features a fair amount of aimless activity and just plain lying around . The latter takes place in the " maxipad " Lelaina shares with Vickie ( Janeane Garofalo ) , who sometimes imagines her own funeral as a scene from Melrose Place ( " chokers and halter tops " ) , Sammy ( Steve Zahn ) , who is gently receding into the wallpaper , and Troy ( Ethan Hawke ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job as a newsstand clerk for eating a Snickers bar without authorization . <P> Troy is just the kind of broody lout a young woman like Lelaina goes for , despite the fact that junior TV-exec Michael ( played by Stiller ) is wooing her . Their triangle provides what passes for narrative structure , and its resolution is perhaps just a little too Brady Bunch  --  that is , too nice and neat . But that 's a small price to pay for a movie in which Vickie , confronting a small , unexpected example of decency , finds it " screws up all my old ideas of good and evil . " And in which a despondent Lelaina , seeking solace from an 800-number therapist , wails , " I ca n't evolve right now . " The movie bobs along on this stream of funny offhandedness , never losing its balance . If it 's 10 o'clock , and you want to know where your supposedly grownup children are , this is a good place to look for them .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
