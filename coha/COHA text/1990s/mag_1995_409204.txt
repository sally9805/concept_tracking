He has fished his way through his life  --  and it 's fitting that one of Ben Schley 's first memories , three-quarters of a century ago , is of the river . He was all of four , and he remembers particularly the sandbox up near the bow of the boat on which the men laid a fire to light the night 's work . There was a fish pot across the Potomac River in which his father , the town banker held a share a V-shaped weir of stone copied from the Indian ones already there when the first Europeans came . The weir had a slotted wood box at the vortex that was a floor to the men and a roof to the fish ; the bass somehow found the way through , but no the catties or the eels . The boy was spellbound by the men raking up wriggling things whose sides gleamed in the firelight . Back home the eels turned into twisted stars in his mother 's skillet . He remembers all of that clearly . " You shrink when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the little workroom of his house in Shepherdstown , West Virginia . The house is half a mile from the one he grew up in and closer than that to the river . The room holds eleven fly rods in a wall rack , two shotguns , a Winchester .30/30 and two file cabinets full of his fishing articles , paintings , and drawings . There are scores of photos ; some are on the wall , but most are shoved into file folders spilling onto the floor as I sift through them . They capture moments when the fish in his dreams became the ones on his hook : photos often with huge rainbows in New Zealand , Atlantic salmon in New Brunswick , a stringer of girthy largemouths taken in Florida in the 1950s , Arctic char from Baffin Island . In one he is wearing a deerstalker hat and smiling straight into the camera . He has the body of a middle distance runner and is holding a salmon that stretches up to his thigh . He looks like someone who made the most of every opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was five-eleven-and-a-half then , Bill , " he says . " I 'm probably an inch shorter now . " It seems to amuse him . His voice is soft , as if polished smooth by water . Now Ben Schley and I are in his canoe heading up to fish the same place the fish pot was , the same place he used to fish all weekend , sleeping under the boat . It 's the stretch he has fished for seventy years , his touchstone water . The place , where the Potomac makes a turn to the east , is called the Horse Backs . A series of long ridges run parallel to the current and break the surface like the withers of a horse . I 'm paddling hard because I 'm younger than his own son and because I 'm not sure how much the chemotherapy has taken out of him . At a certain point I hear his voice behind me , so soft that for a moment I ca n't tell if I 'm imagining it . " Relax . Enjoy the river . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one that says he 'll ask for my help if it 's needed and that he has invited me fishing as a companion , not as a nurse . Maybe he 's also telling me that he does n't know if the time left him is months or years , but whatever it is , the best thing to do with it is savor it . I do , and for the first time notice how I 've never seen formations quite like these , as if they , too , had made a conscious decision to bend to the current 's will . We beach the canoe and get out to fish . Ben wears drugstore polarized glasses secured to his head with mono , and rubber bands around his knee socks to keep them up . He moves with the slow intent of a stalking heron . I tie on a black Woolly Bugger ; Ben fishes flies of his own making  --  a white streamer he calls a Fuller Brush , a popper fashioned out of an old rubber flip-flop , and another from a wine cork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches of water with each twitch . A few minutes later the cork catches on a rock . The current pulls his leader across a rock , slicing it cleanly . The popper disappears downriver in the slow rush of the current . " Well , " he says . " How old was that thing , Ben ? " " That one I made about the time Tom was born . That would have been about 1947 . " His son now works as an archaeologist for the National Park Service . Ben does n't seem dismayed . He lets it go lightly . He bends to tie on the Fuller Brush again , and we go back to it . Soon we 've each caught and released two small fish , 9 or 10 inches of undersized fury which require no recovery time but dash back beneath the ledges as if they 're going to get their older brothers and come back to teach us some manners . Ben watches my cast and says to keep my elbow in tighter still . " Drive forward , Bill , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that final snap , just as if you were hammering a nail . " It 's a good image . It sticks . " That 's it , " he says approvingly . It 's a sort of breakthrough for me , the replacement of muscle power with timing . It feels like I could cast all day without tiring . I ask him his favorite fishing . " Atlantic Salmon , " he says immediately . " There 's such a mystery to them . You do n't know why they 're hitting . Or even if they 're in the river . Then it comes alive and there 's this tremendous pull on your line . But they take the hook slowly and you have to strike slow . An old warden in New Brunswick told me you say the first line of the Lord 's Prayer and when you get to " heaven , " give " em hell . " He also loves browns , wisest and wildest of the trouts , and bonefish . But if he had to choose one place to fish , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was practically baptized in . His father had wanted him to go into insurance , but Ben got his first job in a fish hatchery in 1938 . They hired him mostly because they needed a center for the hatchery basketball team and he 'd played that position in college . He went on to managing fish hatcheries and stocking programs himself . His mechanical aptitude landed him a job as an aerial photographer with the Army Air Corps , but a heart murmur scrubbed him from combat flights . He landed in Normandy D-Day plus six with a Thompson submachine gun under his arm and a three-piece fly rod in his pack . " I had some very good fishing during the war , " he recalls now . " I got in a couple of fire fights and was shot at a couple of times on streams . A lot of the water in Austria and Germany had been private fishing for the Nazis . I enjoyed liberating it . " He recalls a fire fight against soldiers at a Luftwaffe headquarters . His company went in just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showering the men with debris . On the floor , blown out of its frame , a small drawing caught his eye . He rolled it up in his pack . Years later , he took it to the Smithsonian Institution , where it was verified as a 17th century work by a well-known artist . It 's now framed in his house in Shepherdstown . " I 'm not proud that I took it , " he says quietly . " It belonged to somebody . " After the war , he operated a float-fishing business at The Greenbrier , a resort in White Sulphur Springs , West Virginia . One day he got a call that Howard Hughes wanted to go out . The billionaire was dressed in white shirt and flannels and said the Greenbrier River smelled of dead turtles and dead frogs . He did n't know how to cast and soon lost interest in fishing , falling asleep with his line trailing . As sometimes happens with billionaires , he hooked and landed a big bass just as the boat was approaching the takeout . Whereupon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded they go back up and repeat the trip . Ben was a proud young guide and refused the proffered twenty on the way back to the hotel in the car . Hughes turned around and gave the bill to Ben 's son , saying , " Here , boy . Take this and go buy yourself a gold-plated Hopalong Cassidy pistol . " The bill was pried from the boy 's hand and used to buy him the clothes he needed , a pair of shoes , and the 89-cent version of the gun in question . Ben later guided President Eisenhower while managing a national fish hatchery in Vermont , as well as President Carter and Rosalynn in West Virginia . He finally shows me the framed letters from the White House . Ike sent him a fishing knife . Carter inadvertently had taken a Perrine fly box of Ben 's to Camp David . When the President sent it back he included a handmade tippet holder by way of an apology . But the thing to know about Ben is not who he guided or the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , unlike most of us , he lived his life doing what he loved , not dreaming about it . What matters is that you look in his eyes and know he is a man of his word and that he is able to see the good in people , counting among his friends men who were often considered difficult or unreasonable by others . And now , at seventy-nine , he has no regrets , is ready for whatever comes . When we get back to his house , I lift the old Grumman from his Subaru and put it back under the hedge while Ben stows the wooden paddles and tie downs in his shed . We sit by the mud room and take off our wading shoes . The sunlight is slanting through the trees , and though he is pale and tired , he is pleased by the day we 've had . I ask him how the treatments for his leukemia are going . He had a blood transfusion two weeks ago and so far the chemo seems to be working . " I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it works , fine . If not , well .... " He smiles and lifts just the tips of his fingers off one knee . In that gesture is a life 's worth of courage or strength or something that has no name . " I 'm optimistic , " he says . On the drive home , I find myself thinking that Ben Schley is a lucky man . But it 's not lottery luck , where you plunk down a dollar and sit back and maybe the numbers on the pingpong balls on the shaft of air will match yours . It 's the luck of brave men , people who do n't shrink from life but grab it with both hands and squeeze . A few days later I call back to see how he 's doing . " Fine , Bill . And I appreciate your calling . But I have to go now . I 've started a watercolor class at the college here and I 'm late . " As we hang up , I 'm thinking how some men as they age and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
