An image of the Delany family home in Mount Vernon , New York fills the space and dissolves . Then , lights come up slowly on Sadie Delany . She stands straight and tall , addressing the audience . SADIE DELANY Bessie and I have been together since time began , or so it seems . Bessie is my little sister , only she 's not so little . She is 101 years old , and I am 103 . ( Bessie enters the dining room , begins setting up a tea tray . ) You know , people always say they 'd like to live to be one hundred , but no one really expects to , except Bessie . She always said she planned to be as old as Moses . And when Bessie says she 's going to do something , she does it . ( Bessie loads the tray with cups , creamer , sugar . Sadie sits in an easy chair in the sitting room . ) Neither one of us ever married and we 've lived together most all of our lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings on this Earth . After so long , we are in some ways like one person . ( Bessie starts to cross in with tea . ) BESSIE DELANY How do you do ! I 'm Dr. Delany . Make yourself comfortable . Stay as long as you like . We wo n't charge you rent . ( Bessie puts down the tray , looks to the audience , eyes fiercely penetrating . They both laugh uproariously , then Bessie starts to pour tea . ) Truth is , I never thought I 'd see the day when people would be interested in what two old Negro women have to say . Life still surprises me . So maybe the last laugh is on me. p. 3 SADIE DELANY You want to talk to us ? Are you sure ? Well if you think it will help somebody , then it 's worth doing . That 's what Mama used to say . BESSIE DELANY I had a prayer  --  Lord , send us someone new . Everyone we know is dead or they 're boring us to death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits . ) SADIE DELANY ( Joyous . ) Then you knocked on the door ! ( They both laugh . ) Have some tea , now . Go on ! ( Puts sugar in her tea . ) You know , Bessie and I were in helping professions  --  she was a dentist and I was a high school teacher  --  BESSIE DELANY so we 're not rich , but we get by . SADIE DELANY Papa always taught us that with every dollar you earn , the first ten cents goes to the Lord . The second ten cents  --  BESSIE DELANY goes in the bank for hard times SADIE DELANY And the rest is yours , but you better spend it wisely . Well , it 's a good thing we listened because we 're living on that BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together. ) hard-time money now , p. 4 SADIE DELANY and not doing too badly . We Delanys had everything but money . I remember once , Bessie and me and Julia , BESSIE DELANY our little sister , SADIE DELANY made a circle around Papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nickel out of you ! " And he laughed and said " Go ahead and try , daughters , but BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together. ) there 's no nickel here ! " BESSIE DELANY Our Papa was one of the finest men you could find in America or anywhere else for that matter . SADIE DELANY Remember he would take us outside and teach us the names of the planets and stars . BESSIE DELANY Papa knew them all . He was so excited when Halley 's Comet came by . SADIE DELANY He had us all outside that night , and it was a sight to see , flickering light across the landscape . I remember Papa saying , " I do n't think any of us will be here to see Halley 's Comet the next time it comes around . " BESSIE DELANY Well , he was wrong about that . SADIE DELANY Yes he was . We have lived in New York for the last seventy-five years , but Raleigh p. 5 BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together. ) will always be home . BESSIE DELANY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Saint Augustine 's School , SADIE DELANY which was a school for Negroes . BESSIE DELANY That 's their picture over there . SADIE DELANY They got married in the campus chapel and raised all ten of us children right there at  --  BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together. ) good old " Saint Aug 's . " BESSIE DELANY Papa became vice-principal and Mama was the matron , which meant she ran things day-to-day at the school . Our Papa became the first elected Negro bishop of the Episcopal Church , U.S.A. SADIE DELANY That 's a long way for a man who was born a slave on a Georgia plantation , but if you had known Papa , you would n't be surprised . He was always improving himself , and he and Mama brought us up to BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together. ) reach high . SADIE DELANY Mama , who was from Virginia , was an issue-free Negro . BESSIE DELANY ( To Sadie . ) Explain what issue free means . ( Before Sadie can answer . ) That 's a person who had some Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slave . Mama looked white but she never did try to " pass . " She was proud to be a colored woman ! p. 6 SADIE DELANY ( Putting down her cup . ) You know  --  I do n't remember life without Bessie . " Queen Bess , " as Papa used to call her , was born on BESSIE DELANY September 3 , 1891 . They named me Annie Elizabeth . SADIE DELANY I came into this world two years earlier on the nineteenth day of September , BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together. ) 1889 . BESSIE DELANY They named her Sarah Louise , SADIE DELANY but I 've always been called Sadie . BESSIE DELANY ( Laughing . ) " Sweet sister Sadie , " " sweet sister Sadie . " " sweet sister Sadie " SADIE DELANY ( Gently quiets Bessie . ) Bessie was so alert at birth that Mama said she had a funny feeling that child would have a mind of her own . Bessie was what we used to call a " feeling child " ; she was sensitive and emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BESSIE DELANY And Sadie was a " mama 's child . " SADIE DELANY Yes , I followed my Mama around like a shadow . I always did what I was told . I was calm and agreeable . p. 7 BESSIE DELANY She was shy . SADIE DELANY The way I see it , there 's room in the world for both me and Bessie . We kind of balance each other out . ( Bessie gets up , pours more tea . ) BESSIE DELANY People learned not to mess with me from Day One . ( Sadie adds sugar to her tea . ) SADIE DELANY Papa used to say , " You catch more flies with molasses than vinegar . " BESSIE DELANY Well , that 's easy for you to swallow . You are molasses without even trying ! See , Sadie can sweet-talk the world , or play dumb , or whatever it takes to get by without a fuss . But even as a tiny little child , I was n't afraid of anything . I 'd meet the Devil before day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . If Sadie is molasses , then I am vinegar ! Sadie is sugar , and I 'm the spice . ( Bessie sits . ) SADIE DELANY It 's a wonder she was n't lynched . BESSIE DELANY Well , I almost was , but that 's another story . The thing is I know Sadie 's going to get into Heaven , but I 'm not so sure about me . I 'm working on it , but it sure is hard to change . I 've been trying to change for one hundred years without success , that 's not so good , is it ? I 'm afraid when I meet St. Peter at the Gate , he 'll say , " Lord , child , you were mean ! " p. 8 SADIE DELANY She has trouble with the idea of forgiving and forgetting . BESSIE DELANY That 's right . You see , I can forgive , but I ca n't seem to forget . And I 'm not sure the Lord would approve of that at all . I remember things that happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hornet . I wish they did n't . Most of the people I 'm still mad at are long dead and there are things I can tell you ( She stops herself. ) but Sadie will say , " Now Bessie , of the dead  --  BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together. ) say nothing Evil . " BESSIE DELANY So I try to be good . But the rebby boys tend to stand out , make themselves known . You do n't know what a rebby boy is . SADIE DELANY That 's what we call white racist men . It 's short for rebel . BESSIE DELANY I 'll tell you , the way those rebby types treat colored folks  --  well , it just makes me sick . If I had a pet buzzard I 'd treat him better than the way some white folks have treated me ! There is n't a Negro this side of Glory who does n't know exactly what I mean . Those rebby types do n't give colored folks credit for a thing . They learn early to hate . Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . We were the laborers , honey ! We were the backbone of this country ( She stops herself . ) Now , Sadie does n't get all agitated like this . It 's been a little harder for me , partly because I 'm darker than she is , and the darker you are , honey , the harder it is . But it 's also been harder on me because I have a different personality than Sadie . She is a true Christian woman ! I wish I were more like her but I 'm afraid I am a naughty little darky ! Ha ha ! ( Bessie laughs . ) I know it 's not fashionable to use some of the words from our heyday , but that 's who I am ! And who is going to stop me ? Nobody , that 's who ! Ai n't nobody going to censor me , no sir ! I 'm a hundred-and-one years old and at my age , honey , I can say what I want ! ( She gets up and exits into the kitchen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) I 'll tell you something about Bessie . Bessie thinks she 's a little psychic . I try not to encourage this , because it 's ungodly . But over the years I 've come to believe that Bessie is a little , well , intuitive . And I admit that it often comes in handy . You see , we do n't have a telephone . We have to rely on the U.S. mail and on Bessie 's intuition . ( Bessie re-enters with tea biscuits . ) BESSIE DELANY We hate phones ! SADIE DELANY Of course , we had a phone years ago when Bessie was a practicing dentist . We had to , and that was OK . But ever since we moved to this house , in 1957 , we have not had a phone . BESSIE DELANY The phone company comes by and pesters us . ( Sits . ) SADIE DELANY Finally we told the man , " Mister , if the phone company installed a phone for free and paid for a man to stand there and answer it for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) We still would n't want a phone ! BESSIE DELANY He got the message . ( Bessie laughs . ) SADIE DELANY And I 'll tell you something else about Bessie . ( Bessie looks up , surprised . ) She has made a full-time job out of watching over the whole neighborhood . She 's always looking out the window and reporting to me what so-and-so is doing . I say , " Now , Bessie , is that really your business ? " p. 10 BESSIE DELANY If it 's going on in my neighborhood , it 's my business . SADIE DELANY Bessie is a nosy old gal . BESSIE DELANY I 'll tell you about nosy ! People are always asking us how we 've lived past one hundred . ( She laughs . ) I say , " We never married . We never had husbands to worry us to death ! " ( She screams with laughter . They both laugh . ) I love to laugh . Oppressed people have a good sense of humor . Think of the Jews . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at themselves ! ( Bessie and Sadie set tea things on tray . ) BESSIE DELANY Well , we colored folks are the same way . We colored folks are survivors . ( Lights fade as Bessie exits with tea tray and Sadie crosses to pick up a photo album from the book shelf. ) p. 11 Act 1 , Scene 2 : Saint Aug 's Saint Aug 's Photos of the family from the early part of the last century flood the space and dissolve . Lights up  --  Sadie is looking through a family album . Bessie enters with a box of pictures , then exits . As the sisters show each picture , it is projected . SADIE DELANY You asked us about our family so we thought we 'd show you some pictures , get you familiar with who all the faces are . ( Sadie shows photo of Papa from album . ) This is Papa . Born on February 5 , 1858 . Henry Beard Delany , born into slavery on a plantation owned by the Mock family in St. Mary 's , Georgia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo album . ) He was just a little bitty fellow  --  seven years old  --  when the Surrender came in 1865 . The end of slavery ( Bessie enters with second box of photos . ) BESSIE DELANY The end of the Civil War ! When General Robert E. Lee surrendered to the Union at Appomattox Court House ! Now that was surrender ! ( Bessie sits . ) SADIE DELANY We used to ask Papa : " what do you remember about being a slave ? " Well , like a lot of former slaves , he did n't say much about it . Everybody had their own tale of woe and for most people , things had been so bad you did n't want to think about it , let alone talk about it . p. 12 BESSIE DELANY You did n't sit and cry in your soup , honey , you just went on . ( Holds a photo of the grandparents . ) This is his father , our grandfather , Thomas Sterling Delany , and this is his mother , our grandmother , Sarah SADIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had long , straight black hair BESSIE DELANY Remember , we used to giggle about her photograph when we were little SADIE DELANY Her hair looked so peculiar to us . BESSIE DELANY Altogether , Sarah and Thomas had eleven children , and our Papa was the youngest . SADIE DELANY Now , what made the big difference for our family was the Mocks broke the Georgia law by teaching Papa and his brothers and sisters to read and write . BESSIE DELANY Education ! Education , child . Education always makes the difference ! SADIE DELANY Papa said the Mocks were very fine people . BESSIE DELANY That 's a generous thing to say about the people who owned him , would n't you say ? SADIE DELANY But he said there was great variety in the way white people treated Negroes , and it 's true now , too . ( Bessie begins to remove photos from box . ) The Mocks thought a heap of Sarah and Thomas Delany . Maybe they thought the Delanys would n't leave after the Surrender  --  p. 13 BESSIE AND SADIE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did n't have but the shirt on their backs . SADIE DELANY Those were hard times , after slavery days . BESSIE DELANY ( Angry . ) The whites fixed it so those Negroes could never get ahead . SADIE DELANY You see , the Delanys were among only a handful of former slaves in those parts who did n't end up begging . Papa was proud of this , beyond words . They were smart , but they were lucky , and they knew it . They could read and write and had n't been abused , and their family was still together . That 's a lot more than most former slaves had going for them . BESSIE DELANY Now , one day when Papa was already a grown man down in Florida , a white Episcopal priest  --  SADIE DELANY  --  the Reverend Owen Thackara  --  BESSIE DELANY Yes . Reverend Thackara noticed our father had brains , and said to him , " Young man , you should go to college . " SADIE DELANY Well ! The Delanys were Methodists through and through , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mind . He jumped at the chance . p. 14 BESSIE DELANY Reverend Thackara helped Papa go to Saint Augustine 's School , an Episcopal school way north in Raleigh , in the great state of North Carolina . SADIE DELANY Papa was a shining star among shining stars . He was as smart as he could be , and blessed with a personality that smoothed the waters . He soon met a fellow student named Nanny James Logan , ( Bessie picks up a photo of Mama . ) BESSIE DELANY Our Mama  --  SADIE DELANY The belle of the campus . She was a pretty gal and very popular despite the fact that she was smarter than all the boys  --  BESSIE DELANY Smarter ! She was the class valedictorian ! SADIE DELANY Yes , the only reason Papa did n't finish first was because BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together . ) Mama finished first ! BESSIE DELANY Our Mama ! Our Mama was born in Virginia in a community called Yak . SADIE DELANY Today , they call it Mountain Hill . Guess they think that sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are another story . SADIE DELANY Oh yes . p. 15 BESSIE DELANY Mama 's great-grandmother , Mrs. John Logan ,  --  SADIE DELANY who was white  --  BESSIE DELANY Yes  --  she took up with a slave on her plantation while her husband had gone off to  --  BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together . ) The War of 1812 . BESSIE DELANY She had two daughters with the slave , and when her husband returned , do you know he forgave his wife SADIE DELANY Forgave her . BESSIE DELANY And adopted those two colored girls as his own ! ? No one knows what happened to the slave except he must have left town in a big hurry . SADIE DELANY A big hurry  --  BESSIE DELANY One of those two girls , Eliza Logan ( Shows photo ) , got involved with a white man named Jordan Motley . SADIE DELANY We have a picture of him , too . ( Shows photo . ) BESSIE DELANY They had a child , Martha Logan , our grandma ( Shows photo. ) , and three other daughters . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her three sisters were only one-quarter Negro , in the eyes of the world they were colored . So they were in a bind when it came to marrying . p. 16 SADIE DELANY If they wanted to marry a colored man , well most of them were slaves . BESSIE DELANY And they could n't marry white , because it was illegal for Negroes and whites to marry in Virginia . SADIE DELANY Until 1967 ! BESSIE DELANY But , it did n't stop them from having love relationships . SADIE DELANY No , it did n't . Our grandma took up with a man named James Miliam BESSIE DELANY who was as white as he could be and the meanest looking man in Pittsylvania County , Virginia . ( Shows photo . ) SADIE DELANY We remember our grandparents well because we used to go visit every summer , and we were young women when they died . They clearly loved each other very much . They lived like man and wife for fifty years and did n't part until death . BESSIE DELANY Mr. Miliam built a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . SADIE DELANY He even built a walkway between the two houses BESSIE DELANY so he could go see Grandma without getting his boots muddy . SADIE DELANY Now , this kind of arrangement was unusual between a white man and a colored woman . p. 17 BESSIE DELANY More normal was when a white man had a white wife and a colored mistress on the side . SADIE DELANY But James Miliam had no white wife , and was entirely devoted to grandma . BESSIE DELANY He put his money where his heart was ! Every Sunday , Grandma would walk to the White Rock Baptist Church for services . One time , there was a movement in the church to throw her out , on account of her relationship with Mr. Miliam . But one of the deacons stood up and defended her . He reminded the congregation that those two would have been legally married if they could . SADIE DELANY And that those two were committed to each other  --  a lot more so than some of the married people in the congregation . BESSIE DELANY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , they let Grandma keep coming to that church . One summer  --  you and I were there , remember ?  --  Grandma told Mama , " Soon my time to die will be coming . " She told Mama to have some of us grand-children stay with Mr. Miliam when we could , because he would be lonely without her . SADIE DELANY Poor Mr. Miliam . When Grandma died , we saw him  --  he sat in Grandma 's kitchen with his head in his big hands and he said , " What I loved most in this world is lying in the other room . " So Bessie and I stayed , cooked and kept him company . p. 18 BESSIE DELANY In the morning , Mr. Miliam would go out and shoot a squirrel for his breakfast . He always used to say : " those little ones are mighty tasty . " SADIE DELANY Grandma had predicted Mr. Miliam would not last long without her , and she was right . Despite our efforts to keep him happy , he died just two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some white nephew of his who was just furious over the fact that our Mama , " this colored woman , " should get those 68 acres and that money even if she was Mr. Miliam 's daughter ! SADIE DELANY Mama gave $500 to the nephew to keep the fellow happy . She did n't want to be sued . But she did what Mr. Miliam would have wanted . BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together . ) She hung onto that land . SADIE DELANY And to this day , it is still in our family . BESSIE DELANY Those white relatives are just waiting for us to mess up , just once with those taxes . Be one day late . But we have n't . Not in 85 years . And we wo n't . ( Bessie stands . ) That land is BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together . Shaking hands. ) ours . ( Bessie crosses for glass of water on the dining room table. ) p. 19 BESSIE DELANY Our Mama was always a bit embarrassed that her parents were not  --  could not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have a legal marriage someday , or not get married at all ! SADIE DELANY And she got her pick of beaus at Saint Aug 's ! And it did n't matter to her in the least that her favorite was a lot darker than she was . BESSIE DELANY Some colored women who were as light as Mama would not have gotten involved with a dark-skinned man , but Mama did n't care . SADIE DELANY She said he was the cream of the crop , a man of the highest quality . BESSIE DELANY Oh , Mama was a smart woman . SADIE DELANY It takes a smart woman to fall in love with a good man . BESSIE DELANY Our Papa felt the same way about her . SADIE DELANY Papa 's parents presented him with this Bible in which he wrote : ( Opens the Bible . ) " Given to Henry Beard Delany by his parents upon graduating from college . " Then , he took the train right back to Raleigh and he married Miss Nanny James Logan at the Saint Aug 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bessie picks up baby picture of Lemuel and shows audience. ) p. 20 BESSIE DELANY Lemuel , our oldest brother , arrived the next year . Lemuel Thackara . SADIE DELANY He was named after the white Episcopal priest who helped Papa go to college . BESSIE DELANY We were all named after somebody ! SADIE DELANY We have a picture of the whole family , in about  --  ( Sadie crosses to photo and picks it up . She shows it to the audience . ) BESSIE DELANY 1906 . SADIE DELANY Yes . 1906 . Every two years there was a new baby : Lemuel , me , then Bessie , then BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together . ) Julia , Hap , Lucius , Manross , Hubert , Laura , and Samuel Ray . SADIE DELANY See baby Sam in Mama 's arms ? That 's our house at St. Aug 's in the background there . You know , it always seemed like somebody was knocking on our door , looking for food when we were small . Mama never turned anyone away . BESSIE DELANY No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was doing and fix them a plate . BESSIE DELANY Hunger was a big problem for former slaves . SADIE DELANY Most of these folks just went on their way , though one , a man named p. 21 BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together . ) Jesse Edwards SADIE DELANY Mr. Jesse Edwards stayed for ten years . He became like a part of our family . BESSIE DELANY Uncle Jesse . Uncle Jesse had been a slave . Papa gave him the job of carrying the mail . SADIE DELANY And he took that job seriously ! BESSIE DELANY That old fella never had it so good . Now as poor Uncle Jesse got older  --  he got a little scrappy . Like sometimes , we would have to go to his old farmhouse and clean it out . SADIE DELANY A lot of former slaves were like that  --  they 'd never owned anything , so they hung on to all kinds of junk they did n't know what to do with . BESSIE DELANY ( Refers to photo album . ) This is a picture of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the background . Do we have a photo of Uncle Jesse ? Oh , here 's a picture of Mama teaching her cooking class . ( Shows photo from album to Sadie . ) SADIE DELANY Oh my yes . I just do n't know how she did it all . Mama was really a working mother with a job outside the home . She was the matron and teacher too . But she always had time for us. p. 22 BESSIE DELANY She made time for us . SADIE DELANY Her day always started long before dawn , and every night she bathed all ten of us in a tin tub which she had to BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together. ) fill by hand . SADIE DELANY I used to get so tired waiting for my turn because I was the second-oldest child and she would start with the youngest . I do n't know why Mama was so concerned about bathing us every day , except that people used to say that Negroes were dirty people and she may have been trying to combat that image . BESSIE DELANY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever saw . ( Spotting a photo in the album . ) Look ! A picture of Professor Boyer teaching you Greek SADIE DELANY ( Looking at photo . ) Oh , yes Professor Boyer . Why I have n't thought about him in about 100 years ! Where was I ? Oh , yes after each of us had our bath , we would go into Papa 's study where he would read to us from the Bible . BESSIE DELANY Papa edited the Bible . SADIE DELANY Yes , he 'd only read the stories he thought we should hear . I did n't know there were stories in the Bible about adultery and things of that nature until I was a grown girl . Why , I thought it was the Good Book ! All good ! p. 23 BESSIE DELANY Each morning , Papa would make us line up for our " inspection . " He 'd look us over to see if our shoes were polished , our ears were clean , things like that . SADIE DELANY We carried the Delany name and he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BESSIE DELANY That is right . SADIE DELANY He never whipped us but once BESSIE DELANY Sadie ! SADIE DELANY and only once BESSIE DELANY Sadie , you 're not going to tell this ! SADIE DELANY When Bessie and I were children . BESSIE DELANY Lord ! I ca n't sit still for this ! Excuse me . ( Bessie exits into kitchen . ) SADIE DELANY He spotted us in a grove far from where we were supposed to go . We had n't snuck down there on purpose , we just forgot and kind of wandered down there . Well , Papa was just very upset . He was afraid we could have been molested . I guess we were about six and eight years old . He told us to get switches from the peach tree . While we were doing that I whispered to Bessie , " Now , let 's do n't cry , no matter how many times he hits us ! " Bessie agreed , and volunteered to go first with the whipping . Papa whipped her little shoulders and the backs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry . The whipping went on and on , and she did not cry . Finally , Papa quit and said , " Go on , you stubborn little mule . " Now it came my turn and after seeing what Bessie had gone through I changed my mind about not crying . So I howled at the very first lash , and one lash was all I got . I 'm into surviving , and I can see when I 'm licked . What 's the sense in getting licked if you do n't have to ? ( Bessie enters ) p. 24 BESSIE DELANY I am still mad at you over that whipping incident ! It was your idea not to cry in the first place . Well , I would rather die than back down , and that is the truth . See , I take after Mama 's people . Mama could be very feisty , and somehow , like me , she lived to tell about it . I remember once how Mama got mad at some white man who wanted to use our telephone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the put-down ways white people referred to colored women . BESSIE AND SADIE ( Overlap . ) They call men " uncle " or " boy . " BESSIE DELANY Mama told that man , " You may use my phone , but you may not call me auntie . I am no kin to you . " Now , that was a very courageous thing for a colored woman to do in those days . SADIE DELANY Yes it was . BESSIE DELANY Papa would have let it slide . SADIE DELANY It was not in Papa 's nature to make a fuss . BESSIE DELANY That 's right , so it was very difficult for him to whip us that day . SADIE DELANY That 's right . BESSIE DELANY And he had a lot of pride . He really believed in presenting yourself to the world in a dignified fashion . I think that 's why he was unhappy about my pet pig , Retta . You see , Retta was the runt of the litter , cast aside and left to die . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a bottle and fussed over him like a baby . Before I knew it , he weighed five hundred pounds . Wherever Sadie and I went , Retta was n't far behind . p. 25 SADIE DELANY I do n't think Papa thought it was fitting for a Delany child to be wandering around the campus of St. Augustine 's School followed by a big grunting bull pig . BESSIE DELANY One day , Retta bit a man in his privates and that was the end of my poor pig . I imagine he was turned into bacon , and his fat used to make soap . It pains me to this day , because I loved that old pig . SADIE DELANY Our childhood years were very protected . Why , we did n't have but the vaguest notion of what sex was . We had a neighbor who said to us once , " You girls are so green , it 's a wonder those cows do n't mistake you for grass and gobble you up . " BESSIE DELANY Mmm-hm . I would see the rooster worrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . I thought he had no right ! It was n't until years later , when I was teaching school in Brunswick , Georgia , that I finally figured out what this sex stuff was all about from hearing the other teachers talking rather explicitly about sex and men , and I thought , Lord have mercy ! Those girls would say , " Come on out with us tonight , Bessie . " But I did n't take tea for the fever ! If it was n't right , I would n't do it . SADIE DELANY ( Laughing . ) I remember once being in a car with Bessie and one of her beaus . He was just beside himself , and he said , real exasperated , " How come you gals never married ? Do n't y'all know what you 're missing ? " And I said , " Well you do n't miss what you do n't know . " And he nearly went off the road ! He yelled , " You do miss it ! " p. 26 BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SADIE DELANY I thought  --  well  --  it must be pretty good , whatever it is . ( They scream with laughter . Bessie starts putting pictures back in the box . ) BESSIE DELANY We lived a clean life , but Lord , we had a good time . Every one of us children played an instrument  --  flute , violin , trombone , clarinet  --  and as a family we formed a band . Some mornings , people would walk past our house and say , " Y'all had a party last night . " And we 'd say , " Was n't no party ! Was just the bunch of us being musical ! " SADIE DELANY Our Papa was a grand man ! He was extremely talented at music and played the organ beautifully , and when he thought no one was around , he 'd play and sing these old Methodist hymns from his boyhood . BESSIE DELANY Episcopalians did not have hymns like those old Methodists . He 'd play " Amazing Grace . " ( She sings a bar . Sadie hums with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't realize it at the time , but I think he missed his people down in Florida . And when he 'd play their Methodist hymns , he felt closer to them . BESSIE DELANY All of the values that made us strong came from the church . p. 27 SADIE DELANY Yes , it was religious faith that formed the backbone of the Delany family . We were good Christians , and God never let us down . ( Bessie gets up with box of photographs . ) BESSIE DELANY I 'll tell you something else , honey . We were good citizens ! Good Americans . We loved our country , even though it did n't always love us back . ( Slow fade to black as Bessie exits with the box of photographs. ) @x The stage floods with images of early Jim Crow ( 1896 ) : Colored only signs , separate seats in trolleys , water fountains , hospitals and schools . The Delany sisters stare at the photo album , very solemn . Lights up as Bessie crosses to her chair and sits . SADIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess created by those Jim Crow laws . BESSIE DELANY The beginning of Jim Crow in North Carolina was the day that everything changed . SADIE DELANY We already knew we were second-class citizens but those Jim Crow laws set it in stone . BESSIE DELANY At that time , many white people did n't think Negroes had souls . They wanted to believe that . SADIE DELANY And powerful white people were getting more and more nervous with the way colored people , after the Civil War , were beginning to get their piece of the pie . BESSIE DELANY The pecking order was like this : white men were the most powerful , followed by white women . SADIE DELANY Colored people were absolutely below them BESSIE DELANY and if you think it was hard for colored men , honey , colored women were on the bottom . Yes , sir ! Colored women took it from all angles ! p. 29 SADIE DELANY You see , a lot of this Jim Crow mess was about sex  --  BESSIE DELANY Yes , some of this race mixing that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white men would often molest their slave women . SADIE DELANY But a lot of this racial mixing was just attraction between people , plain and simple , just like happened in our family , on Mama 's side . Now , Mama and Papa knew these laws were coming , of course , but they did n't prepare us . Maybe they could n't explain it BESSIE DELANY We encountered Jim Crow laws for the first time on a summer Sunday afternoon . SADIE DELANY We were about five and seven years old at the time . BESSIE DELANY Like in this picture . ( Shows album to Sadie . We see photo of family , beautifully dressed in their Sunday best around 1898 . ) SADIE DELANY There was a place in Raleigh not just for whites but for the whole city , called Pullen Park . BESSIE DELANY Mama and Papa used to take us to Pullen Park for picnics , and that particular day , the trolley driver told us to go to the back . SADIE DELANY We children objected loudly , because we always liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeze BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together. ) would blow our hair . ( They gesture with their hands . ) SADIE DELANY That was part of the fun . BESSIE DELANY But Mama and Papa just gently told us to hush and took us to the back without making a fuss . SADIE DELANY When we got to Pullen Park , we found changes there , too . The spring where you got water now had a big wooden sign across the middle . ( They gesture with their hands . ) BESSIE DELANY On one side , the word " white " was painted , SADIE DELANY and on the other , the word " colored . " What in the world was all this about ? BESSIE DELANY We may have been little children but , honey , we got the message loud and clear . SADIE DELANY ( Laughing . ) But when nobody was looking , Bessie took the tin dipper and leaned over and scooped some water from the other side and said , " I 'm goin ' get me some white water ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . A beat . Sadie stands , crosses to us . Bessie stands to join her. ) p. 31 SADIE DELANY Today is Papa 's birthday . Every year on his birthday , we cook his favorite birthday meal , just the way he liked it : BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together. ) chicken and gravy , SADIE DELANY rice and sweet potatoes , ham , BESSIE AND SADIE Together macaroni and cheese , SADIE DELANY cabbage , BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together. ) cauliflower , broccoli , BESSIE DELANY turnips , and carrots . SADIE DELANY For dessert we have a birthday cake  --  a pound cake  --  BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together. ) and ambrosia , SADIE DELANY made with oranges and fresh coconut . BESSIE DELANY Some people grieve to remember , but we celebrate . Why , we thank the Lord for our Papa everyday ! SADIE DELANY Oh , please do n't go  --  Bessie and I love to talk while we work . ( Sadie moves towards dining room . The stage slowly revolves . Bessie follows . The table is about to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . ) Why , all we do is talk about folks who turned to dust so long ago that we 're the only people on this earth with any memory of them . ( They unfold the tablecloth which rests on the table. ) p. 32 BESSIE DELANY I was just thinking how fortunate it was for Sadie and me that our earliest experiences with whites predated Jim Crow . SADIE DELANY Miss Grace Moseley BESSIE DELANY Oh , remember SADIE DELANY She was our favorite . She had come to Saint Aug 's to teach , along with her mother BESSIE DELANY Those two were the cream of the crop , child . SADIE DELANY They were very fine , cultured white women , from a good family and with the best manners and education . BESSIE DELANY Miss Moseley did n't like it that at Saint Aug 's the white teachers lived separately from the colored . SADIE DELANY She wanted to live with us . BESSIE DELANY So , every Wednesday evening Miss Moseley would invite Sadie and me , and our little sister Julia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bessie takes out silverware and begins to set it . ) SADIE DELANY We would all pile on her bed and she would read us Shakespeare and all the classics . Julia was so little she would fall asleep , but Bessie and I would just snuggle up with Miss Moseley and she would read to us . That is a lovely memory I carry with me , and it makes me smile to this day . These are Mama 's linens . Our favorite serving pieces are Mama 's , too . They 're up there . They 're wedding pieces . Mama never had silver , but before Bessie retired , she bought me a set of silver plate . Is n't she a sweet sister ? p. 33 BESSIE DELANY Knowing people like Miss Moseley and our white grandfather , Mr. Miliam , made this Jim Crow mess seem mighty puzzling . ( Bessie lays dinner plates . ) SADIE DELANY Yes it did , but I 'll tell you how I handled Jim Crow . There was a shoe store in Raleigh called Heller 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you were colored , you had to go in the back to try on shoes , and the white people sat in the front . It was n't Mr. Heller 's fault ; this was the Jim Crow law . I would go in there and say , " Good morning , Mr. Heller , I would like to try on those shoes in the window . " And he would say , " That 's fine , Miss Delany , go on and sit in the back . " And I would say , " Where , Mr. Heller ? " And he would say , " Back there . " And I would say , " Back where ? " Well , I 'd just worry that man to death . Finally , he 'd say , " Just sit anywhere , Miss Delany ! " ( Sadie sits . ) And so I would sit myself down in the white section , and smile . BESSIE DELANY Lord ! I hate when you play dumb like that ! ( Sadie laughs , starts to set goblets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face under Jim Crow  --  I would feel it down to my core . I was not a crying child , except when I was being treated badly because of my race . In those instances  --  like when they would n't serve me at the drugstore counter in Raleigh  --  I would go home and sit on my bed and weep and weep and weep , the tears streaming down my face . ( Very upset . ) Now , Mama would come up and sit on the foot of my bed . She never said a word . She knew what I was feeling . She just did not want to encourage my rage . So my Mama would just sit and look at me while I cried , and it comforted me . I knew that she understood , and that was the most soothing salve . ( Sadie holds up a pair of crystal goblets. ) p. 34 SADIE DELANY These were Mama 's too . Are n't they lovely ? ( Bessie sets candlesticks and two serving dishes . Sadie finishes setting the goblets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DELANY The words used to describe us most often were colored , Negro , black , and nigger . I 've also been called jiggerboo , pickaninny , coon  --  you name it , honey . Some of these words are worse than others , and how mean they are depends on who is saying them and why . Personally , I do n't use the word black very often to describe myself and my sister . To us , black was a person who was , well , black , and honey , I mean black as your shoe . I 'm not black , I 'm brown ! Actually , the best word to describe me , I think , is colored . I am a colored woman or a Negro woman . Either one is OK . People dislike those words now . Today they use this term African American . It would n't occur to us to use that . We prefer to think of ourselves as Americans , that 's all ! ( Sadie gets large serving platter . Bessie sets serving spoons . ) SADIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lighter-skinned was more desirable . But it was not something that was even discussed in our household . We were different shades , and it did n't make a bit of difference if you were white , black , p. 35 BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together. ) grizzly , or gray , you were you . SADIE DELANY Excuse me . ( Sadie exits to the kitchen with platter . Bessie reaches for the flower vase . ) BESSIE DELANY I think I 'm just as good as anyone . That 's the way I was brought up . I 'll tell you a secret : I think I 'm better ! Ha ! I remember being aware that colored people were supposed to feel inferior . I knew I was a smart little thing , a personality , an individual  --  a human being ! I could n't understand how people could look at me and not see that , because it sure was obvious to me . ( The stage revolves . Bessie enters the kitchen . Sadie is slicing vegetables . ) SADIE DELANY Now Mama and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we were quite young when we learned colored folks were being murdered . ( Bessie gives Sadie the vase . ) BESSIE DELANY They were being lynched . ( Sadie fills vase at the sink . ) SADIE DELANY Yes  --  we would hear the teachers talking among themselves about some poor Negro just walking down the side of the road , in the wrong place , at the wrong time . BESSIE DELANY Those rebby boys would just grab him and hang him from a tree , just for fun . p. 36 SADIE DELANY It was like entertainment to those fellas . ( Bessie cuts the flowers at the table . She arranges them in the vase . ) BESSIE DELANY The rebby boys would come in the middle of the night , and get him out of his bed and hang him up , in front of his wife and children . Sometimes they 'd hang his whole family . Why , there was one story we heard of a pregnant colored woman who was hung from her feet , and they slit her abdomen open and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlaps Bessie . ) Lord have mercy ! BESSIE DELANY and she and her unborn baby just died right there , like that . SADIE DELANY I do n't understand any of this . BESSIE DELANY It does n't make any more sense to me now than it did then . If it were n't for those kind white missionaries at Saint Aug 's , and my mother 's white relatives who loved me , I would have hated all white people . Every last one . ( She looks at Sadie who shakes her head . ) Once in a while , God sends a good white person my way , even to this day . I think it 's God 's way of keeping me from becoming too mean . And when he sends a nice one to me , then I have to eat crow . And honey , crow is a tough old bird to eat , let me tell you . ( Bessie exits to dining room , sets flowers in the center of the table . Sadie continues to chop vegetables in the kitchen. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little too sheltered . Why , I was almost afraid of men , really . I was n't allowed to go downtown by myself until I was a grown girl and then I was always kind of jittery . You can imagine that when it came time for me to graduate from Saint Aug 's , I did n't want to leave . The campus was the only home I 'd ever known . But on graduation day , Papa said to me , " Daughter , you are college material . You owe it to your nation , your race , and yourself to go . And if you do n't , then shame on you ! " Well , it seemed to me that I had no choice but to go on with my schooling . ( Bessie reenters , puts on her apron . ) But Papa said to me , to both of us , " Daughters , I have no money , and you must n't take a scholarship . If you take a scholarship , you will be beholden to the people who gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So I started looking for teaching jobs and I found out there was an opening for being a supervisor , which involved visiting schools all over Wake County , North Carolina . Well , I had to learn to drive and I learned to drive Lemuel 's car , and naturally , since I had learned to drive , Bessie decided she needed to learn , too . It seems to me she landed Lemuel 's car in a ditch while she was learning ! BESSIE DELANY I did no such thing ! ( Sits . ) SADIE DELANY Lemuel was n't too happy . ( Bessie scrapes carrots . ) I got to be a good driver , and when Mr. Booker T. Washington would come to visit Raleigh , he would climb into the passenger seat of Lemuel 's car and I would drive him all around the county and show him my schools . He was so appreciative of the work I was doing . p. 38 BESSIE DELANY When we were teaching , we saw for the first time what life was really like for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DELANY It made our hearts bleed . SADIE DELANY I realized I was a child of privilege and I had to share my good fortune . I kept remembering what Papa always said : " Your mission " BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together. ) " is to help somebody . " SADIE DELANY Yes , those words kept me going . BESSIE DELANY This was just forty-five years after the Surrender , and most of these Negroes were in bad shape , honey . They needed help with the basics . SADIE DELANY You see , oftentimes , learning to read and write for the children was not the top priority . Teaching people about food preparation  --  like how to can food  --  was more important . BESSIE DELANY A lot of the time what those folks needed was inspiration . SADIE DELANY Yes , a little encouragement . That goes a long way . BESSIE DELANY I remember when I left home to teach . I was twenty years old . I 'd never been away from home . Papa took me to the train station in Raleigh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train pulled away from the station and I looked back and saw my Papa standing there , watching me , I thought I was going to die . I started to sob . I cried so hard that the people from the white car came to the colored car to get a look at this little darky just carrying on ! Well , I 'm embarrassed to say I created quite a commotion . The conductor came along and said , " What 's the matter , did somebody die ? " Now what 'd he have to go and say that for ? It was my girlhood that was dying and I knew it . ( Sadie crosses to Bessie at table. ) p. 39 SADIE DELANY Well it turned out you were the most exciting thing to happen to Boardman , North Carolina , in about a hundred years . Child , they 'd never seen the likes of her ! She 'd walk through that town and the colored men would just stop and stare . They would n't say a word , they 'd just take off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laughs . ) One time , I turned and said , " Just what are you looking at ? " They did n't answer . Finally , one of them said , " Why Miss Delany , we ca n't help it ; you look just like a slice of Heaven . " And I said , " Well , I ai n't your slice of Heaven , so put your eyes back in yo ' head . SADIE DELANY Child , she meant business . BESSIE DELANY Do n't go thinking because Sadie and I are maiden ladies that we did n't have our share of beaus . We were popular , good-looking gals , but I think we were too smart , too independent for most men . ( Sadie begins to score cucumber . Bessie clears the carrots to the counter and exits to the dining room . ) SADIE DELANY I had one beau named Frank  --  who was particularly fond of me . He was a fellow student of Lemuel 's , studying medicine at Shaw University . Papa used to get kind of annoyed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking even when Papa thought it was time for him to leave . So Papa would just clear his throat and stomp around , hoping Frank would get the hint . p. 40 BESSIE DELANY ( Opening the door . ) We had to almost shove Frank out the door ! SADIE DELANY I liked Frank a lot , but then one day , Papa told me , " Sadie , you wo n't be seeing any more of Frank for now . " It seems Lemuel had reported to Papa that Frank had been linked to some scandal , I never learned the details . All I know is that I never saw Frank again . Well , here I am an old maid . Oops , I should n't say " old maid " ' cause it makes Bessie mad . BESSIE DELANY ( Enters with a bag of potatoes . ) We are not old maids . We are maiden ladies . SADIE DELANY Well , whatever we are , I have no regrets about it . I think Frank would have worried me to death . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exits into dining room . Bessie puts six potatoes in a bowl . ) BESSIE DELANY I suppose Lemuel and Papa thought they were doing the right thing by Sadie , forbidding her to see Frank anymore , but I do n't think it was right . She was a grown woman . It was her choice to make , not theirs ! She should have had a say in the matter . Oh , I do n't know what she saw in old Frank , anyway . He was kind of dull and talked too much , though I guess I should n't say that , because I can out-talk anyone . Yes , sir ! I do n't know how Sadie 's put up with this old flabber-mouth for the past one hundred years . ( Sadie reenters with a serving dish for the cucumber and passes a small photo to Bessie. ) p. 41 SADIE DELANY I do n't know how I have either ! I found this picture of you teaching in Brunswick . Remember , it was on your way to your job in Brunswick  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at photo , puts it in her pocket , then starts to scrub potatoes . ) BESSIE DELANY Oh , yes that 's right . I had to change trains in Waycross , Georgia . I was sitting in the little colored waiting room at the station , and I took my hair down and was combing it . SADIE DELANY She had hair down to here . ( She indicates her knee . ) BESSIE DELANY I was fixing myself up . I was going to my new job , and I wanted to look nice . There was no one in there except me and two colored teachers from New York who were traveling with me to Brunswick . SADIE DELANY So , there she was with her long hair down when this white man opened the door to the colored waiting room . BESSIE DELANY The white man stuck his head in and started , well , leering at me . He was drunk , and he smelled bad , and he started mumbling things . And I said , " Oh , why do n't you shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white waiting room ? " SADIE DELANY ( Overlapping. ) hmmmm hmmmmmm hm hmmmmmm hmmmmmmm. p. 42 BESSIE DELANY He slammed the door and I could hear him shouting at the top of his lungs outside , " The nigger bitch insulted me ! The nigger bitch insulted me ! " SADIE DELANY The two colored teachers slipped out the back and made a beeline for the woods . BESSIE DELANY Yes ! They hid in the woods ! I guess I ca n't blame them . Well , I could see a crowd begin to gather on the platform , and I knew I was in big trouble . SADIE DELANY Papa always said , " If you see a crowd , you go the other way . " BESSIE DELANY I was just waiting for somebody to get a rope . Thousands of Negroes had been lynched for far less than what I had just done . But I just continued to sit on the bench , combing my hair , while that white man was a-carrying on ! You see , if you act real scared , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . ) Two things saved me : that glorious , blessed train rounded the bend , breaking up the crowd and giving me my way to get on out of there . And it helped that the white man was drunk as a skunk , and that turned off some of the white people . But I was n't afraid to die ! I know you ai n't got to die but once , and it seemed as good a reason to die as any . I was ready . Lord , help me , I was ready . SADIE DELANY You were a fool to provoke that white man . You should have ignored him . p. 43 BESSIE DELANY How do you ignore some drunk , smelly white man treating you like trash ? SADIE DELANY Sometimes , it 's better to put up with it , and live to tell about it . At the very least you should have run off into the woods with those other two teachers . BESSIE DELANY ( To the audience . ) I told you : I would rather die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be alive . ( Quick fade to black as Sadie exits. ) p. 44 Act 2 , Scene 2 : Harlem-Town Harlem-Town Images and music of 1900s and 1920s Harlem . The sisters place fresh pineapple and cherries on a ham . They work together in perfect synchronicity . Sadie looks up . SADIE DELANY We made our first trip to New York City with our Mama in 1915 . BESSIE DELANY On that first visit , we could not get over the size of New York . SADIE DELANY There were so many different kinds of people , from all over the world . In North Carolina , there were white people , Negroes , and Indians . That was it . BESSIE DELANY In New York , there were Irish people , German people , Jewish people , Italian people , and so on . So many different kinds of white people ! SADIE DELANY And they ate different foods and you could smell strange things cooking BESSIE DELANY And you 'd hear voices , speaking different languages SADIE DELANY We stayed with friends of the family for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wanted more ! BESSIE DELANY So when we returned to Raleigh , we talked to Papa about moving to New York to attend college . p. 45 SADIE DELANY By then we were grown women , twenty-four and twenty-six years old , and toughened up by our rural teaching years . BESSIE DELANY So when a Presbyterian minister asked Mama , " Are n't y'all afraid to let those girls go up to Harlem-town ? " SADIE DELANY Mama said : " No , I 'm not afraid to let my girls go anywhere . We 've taught them right from wrong and if they do n't do what 's right , there 's nothing we can do about it now . " ( Sadie puts cherries in refrigerator . ) BESSIE DELANY Eventually , all of us Delany children , except Lemuel , moved to New York City . SADIE DELANY Our brother , Lucius , was the first one of us to get an apartment and he let us all move in with him  --  ( Sadie picks up the ham to put in oven . ) BESSIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Together . ) Seventh Ave . BESSIE DELANY at the corner of 145th Street . SADIE DELANY Our share of the rent was nine dollars each . ( Bessie puts pineapple in refrigerator and takes out chicken . Sadie brings celery and butter to the table. ) p. 46 BESSIE DELANY I had always dreamed I would become a medical doctor , but I ran out of time and money . My brother , Hap , who was a dentist , tried to get me to enroll at New York University , where he had graduated . But this was 1918 , and New York University would not take women in its dentistry program in 1918 . ( Sadie gets stuffing from refrigerator . ) SADIE DELANY So , she enrolled at Columbia University . BESSIE DELANY Out of a class of about 170 , there were 11 women , six colored men , and me . I was the only colored woman ! It was the same for Sadie at Pratt Institute . ( Bessie washes chicken in sink . ) You know , I studied very hard in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , rather than have to deal with some of those old white professors . Yes sir ! To be fair  --  oh , it 's so hard to be fair  --  I have to admit that some of them treated me just fine , but one instructor really had it in for me . There was an assignment where he failed me , yet I knew my work was good . One of my white girl friends , BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together . ) Sadie Goodman , BESSIE DELANY the youngest one in the class  --  she said , " Bessie , let me turn in your work as if it was mine , and see what grade he gives it . " I 'll tell you what happened , honey . She passed with my failed work ! That was the kind of thing that could make you crazy , as a Negro . It 's no wonder some of us have stopped trying altogether . There are plenty of white folks who say " Why have n't Negroes gotten further than they have ? What 's wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have this to say : " Are you kidding ? " ( Bessie brings chicken to Sadie. ) p. 47 SADIE DELANY See , when you are colored , everyone is always looking for your faults . If you are going to make it , you have to be entirely honest , clean , brilliant , and so on . Because if you slip up once , the white folks say to each other , BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together . ) " See , what 'd I tell you . " SADIE DELANY So you do n't have to be as good as white people , you have to be better or the best . BESSIE DELANY When Negroes are average , they fail , unless they are very , very lucky . Now , if you 're average and white , honey , you can go far . Just look at Dan Quayle . If that boy was colored he 'd be washing dishes somewhere . ( Sadie stuffs chicken . ) SADIE DELANY I 'll tell you a story . I got my first teaching job in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.S. 119 in Harlem , which was an elementary school , mostly colored . This was a typical assignment for a colored teacher . But I wanted to teach at a high school because it was a promotion and it paid better . So I had to be a little clever  --  Bessie would say BESSIE DELANY sneaky  --  ( Bessie stirs macaroni on stove . ) SADIE DELANY clever ! to find ways to get around these brick walls they set up for colored folks . So I asked around quietly for some advice . A friend of my brother Hubert 's , who worked for the Board of Education p. 48 BESSIE DELANY he was colored SADIE DELANY Yes suggested a plan which I followed : I applied for a high school position , and when I reached the top of the list , I received a letter in the mail saying they wished to meet with me in person . Hubert 's friend said : BESSIE DELANY " Skip the appointment . " SADIE DELANY Yes . " Send them a letter , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the first day of classes . " Child , when I showed up that day  --  at Theodore Roosevelt High School , a white high school  --  they just about died when they saw me . A colored woman ! But my name was on the list to teach there , and it was too late for them to send me someplace else . The plan had worked ! I became the first colored teacher in the New York City system to teach domestic science on the high school level . I spent the rest of my career teaching at excellent high schools . I never let prejudice stop me from what I wanted to do in this life , child . Life is short , and it 's up to you to make it sweet . ( Sadie puts chicken in the oven , gets cheese and a casserole dish . Bessie drains the macaroni . ) BESSIE DELANY I was known in the Harlem community as " Dr. Bessie " to distinguish me from my brother Hap , who was known as " Dr. Delany . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30s , and ' 40s when just about every living soul in Harlem knew of Dr. Bessie . My patients would go on vacation and send postcards addressed only to " Dr. Bessie , New York City " and I would get those cards . This was the center of Harlem ! From my office window you could see everything that was going on . Harlem was like a beehive , with people running every which way , going to work , school , church or to entertainment . It was a positive place in those days . p. 49 SADIE DELANY Now , being good girls , Bessie and I did not venture too far into the jazz scene . After all , we were Bishop Delany 's daughters . BESSIE DELANY That 's right ! We did n't want to have anything to do with smooth-talking men and their fast women . ( They begin to make the macaroni and cheese together . ) SADIE DELANY If we went to a nightclub , it was always with a proper escort . BESSIE DELANY Usually , we went to places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hubert , became friendly with many famous entertainers like BESSIE DELANY Ethel Waters , Alberta Hunter SADIE DELANY Oh , that Alberta Hunter was one of the nicest women we ever met . BESSIE DELANY Fletcher Henderson , Cab Calloway SADIE DELANY Duke Ellington BESSIE DELANY and Lena Horne . James Weldon Johnson , the poet , was one of my patients . SADIE DELANY We were acquainted with these people , but our close friends were in the professional set . Like Mr. William Kelly , the editor of the Amsterdam News  --  he never passed up an invitation for our cooking . ( They laugh . When Sadie is n't looking , Bessie slathers lots of butter on top of the macaroni and cheese . Sadie taps her hand . ) You 're a naughty old gal . p. 50 BESSIE DELANY I use butter when no one 's looking ! ( Sadie covers macaroni and cheese and tidies up . Bessie crosses to refrigerator for a glass of water , then sits . ) When I started my practice in Harlem in 1923 , I charged two dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five dollars for a silver filling , and ten dollars for a gold filling . What was I charging when I retired ? The same thing , of course ! I never raised my rates because I was getting by OK . ( Sadie starts to make gravy . ) SADIE DELANY In the ' 20s , Bessie 's office became a meeting place for Negro activists in Harlem . ( To Bessie . ) Remember the time you got Frazier and his friends to protest  --  BESSIE DELANY ( Indicating the gravy . ) I 'll do that ! SADIE DELANY No , you will not ! You burn my pans . You do it all the time . They get black on the bottom . BESSIE DELANY I do n't ! If you 'd just let me do it my way . ( To the audience : ) I have a wrought iron pan . I like to cook everything in that pan . Everything . Just like our grandpa , Mr. Miliam , taught us the old fashion way . ( To Sadie . ) I never burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't burn another one of mine either ! Now go on and tell them about Frazier . ( Bessie wo n't . So Sadie does . ) E. Franklin Frazier was a graduate student at Columbia with me when I was getting my Masters in Education there . ( Sadie looks at Bessie . She does n't respond . ) He was a great friend of ours . BESSIE DELANY Anyway ! One time I got tired of listening to Frazier and his friends planning another sit in . ( Sadie goes back to her gravy . ) They had just re-released the film Birth of a Nation , a very mean-spirited film which degraded Negroes . It was showing at the Capitol Theater in Manhattan . This was in about what  --  1925 ? SADIE DELANY Yes , 1925 . BESSIE DELANY So I said to Frazier , " How can y'all sit around here planning those silly sit-ins when they 're showing Birth of a Nation at the Capitol ? I do n't know about you , but I 'm going down there tonight and protest . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! " Well , I guess I inspired them . But what happened is kind of funny  --  SADIE DELANY  --  at least to you . ( Sadie gets garnish for ham , and places ham on dish with garnish. ) p. 52 BESSIE DELANY Hap had a patient with an emergency and I stayed to help , so we were late . Well , we got there just in time to see the cops throwing poor Frazier , W.E.B . Du Bois and Walter White into the police wagon . The next day , those boys chewed me out good ! They came to my office and said , " You convinced us to protest and then you did n't show up ! You have a lot of nerve ! " And I said , " Well , Hap and I did show up , it 's just that y'all were too busy getting yourselves arrested to notice . " They did n't think it was too funny . SADIE DELANY But all you had to do was say the word " protest " and Bessie was usually there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anyone cares to remember . I never did like protests . No , no , no , I do not like confrontations . BESSIE DELANY There were a lot of colored people like Sadie . Really , those were the two extremes . On the one hand you had Booker T. Washington , a smoother of the waters , not a radical . SADIE DELANY He 's not appreciated today , but he did a lot for our people getting them educated . He wanted you to be literate , to own your forty acres and a mule . BESSIE DELANY Sadie is more like Booker T. Washington . ( Sadie sits with Bessie at the table . ) SADIE DELANY And on the other hand , you had W.E.B . Du Bois , a militant . More like Bessie. p. 53 BESSIE DELANY I can still see his face : he was a good-looking , brown-skinned man with a mustache , and very intelligent-looking eyes . Dr. Du Bois was the editor of The Crisis and was always speaking out against one thing or another  --  SADIE DELANY Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too threatening to white people SADIE DELANY and therefore dangerous for Negroes . Now , Dr. Du Bois knew our Papa because at that time , there were very , very few educated , prominent Negroes . He never stayed with Papa when he came to visit in Raleigh . BESSIE DELANY He stayed with Lemuel . SADIE DELANY Papa was not aggressive enough by Dr. Du Bois 's standards . BESSIE DELANY Still , I believe in Dr. Du Bois 's approach : I would have given life and limb to the cause . SADIE DELANY Sometimes , colored women were not even welcome in the movement , Bessie . BESSIE DELANY Too bad , I was there whether they liked it or not ! SADIE DELANY ( She laughs . ) That 's true ! BESSIE DELANY I was torn between two issues  --  colored , and women 's rights . It seemed to me that no matter how much I had to put up with as a woman , the bigger problem was being colored. p. 54 SADIE DELANY That 's right . BESSIE DELANY Though one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together. ) when women got the right to vote . BESSIE DELANY Sadie and I registered to vote immediately and we have never missed a chance to vote since . SADIE DELANY Now , where we vote , the people at the polls have come to know us . They say , " Here come the Delany sisters . We knew you 'd get here , BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together. ) @x Lights come up on the Delany sisters in the kitchen listening to the hymn Lift Every Voice.See Special Note on Songs and Recordings on copyright page . They are peeling oranges . After an interval : SADIE DELANY ( Turning radio off . ) That was Papa 's favorite hymn . BESSIE DELANY In April 1928 , Lemuel sent a telegram , " Come home quick , Papa 's very ill . " I did not get to Raleigh in time to see him . He had died , peacefully , at home . I saw his body . He had beautiful hands , and when I saw those hands I realized it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All our brothers came , and for a long time , people remembered how those six Delany sons  --  three on each side  --  carried Papa 's coffin to the chapel . They were tall , good-looking boys and it was quite a sight , the way they lifted Papa 's coffin up on their shoulders . Poor Mama was mourning and grieving like the world was coming to an end . I remember telling her  --  she was a good-looking woman even then  --  that it would be OK by me if she wanted to remarry someday . SADIE DELANY Mama said , " I 've had my husband , and I do n't want another one , ' cause there 's no one else that can compare . " p. 56 BESSIE DELANY I stayed behind in Raleigh to help Mama pack her things , which was very hard . SADIE DELANY She had so many belongings and memories to let go of . ( Sadie gets bowl of sugar . ) Papa 's death hit me hard . I did n't realize how safe I felt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New York , I knew that somehow he was watching out for me . But even as a grown woman , forty years old or more , I was still something of a mama 's child . I loved to be in the company of my Mama and I would just do anything for her . ( They start to cut oranges . ) BESSIE DELANY While Papa was still alive , Mama had never seen much of the world at all . SADIE DELANY She had the whole world on her shoulders as the bishop 's wife and being the matron at Saint Aug 's . BESSIE DELANY So after we moved her up to New York , she was ready to go places . SADIE DELANY Even when she was very elderly , all you had to do was say , " Let 's go , " and she 'd say , BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together . ) " Just let me get my hat . " BESSIE DELANY Some of the happiest days of Sadie 's life were going on trips with Mama  --  especially when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SADIE DELANY The most memorable moment of the trip came in London , when we went to see Paul Robeson in Othello . Paul 's performance in the play was legendary , because he interpreted Othello from the perspective of a Negro man , which was a very important breakthrough in the history of theater . When Paul heard Mama and I were there , he was ecstatic . He had us brought backstage right away . He said it was so good to see some Delanys from Harlem ! But he seemed a little homesick . BESSIE DELANY Paul Robeson was not treated well in his later years . ( Bessie gets up to discard orange peels . ) Sadie and I were in charge of Mama 's happiness , but I think Hubert gave Mama her greatest moment as an old lady . SADIE DELANY Oh , he certainly did ! You know , there was n't a soul in Harlem who did n't know our brother Hubert . He was very active in the NAACP , an assistant U.S. attorney  --  BESSIE DELANY He prosecuted five hundred cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SADIE DELANY There ! There ! Over there ! BESSIE DELANY Now , Hubert had been the attorney and adviser for the singer Marian Anderson  --  SADIE DELANY That was back in 1939 when the Daughters of the American Revolution kept her from singing in Constitution Hall in Washington p. 58 BESSIE DELANY because she was colored . SADIE DELANY And then Mrs. Roosevelt intervened and arranged for Marian to sing at the Lincoln Memorial . BESSIE DELANY Oh , that Mrs. Roosevelt was ahead of her time about equality of the races . To this day , we admire Eleanor Roosevelt more than any other famous white person . SADIE DELANY So , as a surprise for Mama , Hubert arranged for her to meet Eleanor Roosevelt ! BESSIE DELANY When we came into the room , there she was , and she jumped up like a jackrabbit to greet Mama , taking her hand . It was pretty wonderful to see the former First Lady of the United States jump up , so respectful-like , to greet Mama , an old colored lady . ( Sadie gets grater for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sadie , too  --  could cook a meal for almost nothing . You never saw people who could live cheaper than we could . In fact , you remember ! we fed people during the Depression . SADIE DELANY Well , of course we did ! ( Sadie gets coconut from refrigerator and starts to grate the coconut . ) BESSIE DELANY I remember when that old stock market crashed , rich white men were jumping out of buildings and things like that . I ca n't imagine having so little faith in the Lord , and so much faith in money , that you would end your life over a little thing like losing your fortune . The Lord says money is Evil , and He is right ! Money is the root of every mess you can think of , including slavery . Greed ! Profiting off the backs of others ! p. 59 SADIE DELANY Now Bessie kept her practice going during the Depression , although now I wonder how you did . BESSIE DELANY Remember the day , one of my patients went to sign up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BESSIE DELANY and she asked me to go along to keep her company ? SADIE DELANY They gave her some kind of little job . BESSIE DELANY And I was n't planning on this at all , but I said , " Say , do you have anything for me ? I am a licensed dentist and I 'm not doing so well myself . " Well , next thing I knew , the government set up a clinic near City Hall , with me running it , but it was n't no handout , no , sir ! Let me make that perfectly clear . It was work-for-hire . I have never taken a handout from the government in my life . I am the kind of Negro that most white people do n't know about . Or maybe they do n't want to know about . Just listen to that fella , David Duke , down in Louisiana  --  the fella that was with the Klan and then he was going to run for president . David Duke does n't think there are Negroes like me and Sadie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute to America . Well , we are just as good Americans as he is  --  better ! Yes , I think I 'm going to write a letter , and I 'm going to say , " Dear Mr. Duke : This is just to set the record straight . I am a Negro woman . I was brought up in a good family . My Papa was a devoted father . I went to college ; I paid my own way . I am not stupid . I 'm not on welfare . And I 'm not scrubbing floors . Especially not yours . " ( Bessie exits. ) p. 60 SADIE DELANY By the 1930s we had a heap of nieces and nephews and we loved them all dearly . But one of them , Little Hubie , had a special place in our hearts . He was damaged when he was born . He was what we called a spastic child . Little Hubie could n't walk , so Julia pushed him around in a carriage . ( Bessie enters with the ambrosia dish and gives it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Little Hubie had a very active mind . His cousin , Harry , who was the same age as Little Hubie , was a very bright little boy , but one time we were giving Harry a spelling lesson and he spelled a word incorrectly . Little Hubie was sitting nearby and he banged his hand on the table and shook his head . BESSIE DELANY He knew that Harry had spelt it wrong ! ( They begin making the ambrosia , layering the oranges and fresh coconut . After each layer Bessie sprinkles sugar . ) SADIE DELANY Dean , Bessie 's boyfriend at the time was there that day and he was particularly fond of Little Hubie . So one day Bessie asked him , " You think Little Hubie is going to be all right , do n't you Dean ? " She was really looking for him to agree with her , you know . But he did n't answer . She asked again . " You think Little Hubie is going to be all right , do n't you ? " And he finally said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It had just never occurred to us that Little Hubie would die . p. 61 BESSIE DELANY We just thought that with enough prayer , enough love , and enough determination we would overcome this . But it was n't part of God 's plan . SADIE DELANY It was pneumonia that finally took him from us . He was ten years old when he died . It was during the war , the date was the seventh of March , 1943 . Bessie still sleeps with his blanket on her bed . Little Hubie 's death humbled us . We were sort of cocky before that . We thought we could do anything , fix any problem . We were not afraid of adversity . We were Delanys ! After Little Hubie , we realized you ca n't always get what you want in life . ( Sadie clears the cutting boards and coconut plate to the sink . A beat . ) BESSIE DELANY After the war was over , we bought a little cottage in the North Bronx with a garden . It was like the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to put a porch on . Remember ? He laughed at us . SADIE DELANY He said , " You 're going to put a porch on that little old two-room cottage ? " BESSIE DELANY And we were very annoyed at him . We said , " Mister , we 're from North Carolina and we 've been cooped up in apartments since the BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together . ) First World War . BESSIE DELANY Now we 've got this house out in the country , and where we 're from , a house ai n't a home p. 62 BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together. ) unless it 's got itself a porch ! " BESSIE DELANY So we got ourselves a porch . ( Sadie brings a bowl of butter to the table and begins to cream the butter . Bessie measures the dry ingredients . ) SADIE DELANY Mama was getting very elderly , getting on ninety years old , and we wanted her to live forever . When the weather was nice , we would each take her by the arm , on either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BESSIE DELANY One little boy yelled at us , " Look , three grandmas going for a walk . " We thought it was funny . But it was true , we were getting old , too . ( They laugh . ) SADIE DELANY And soon , we started having trouble keeping Mama in line . BESSIE DELANY Something Mama would do , she would give money to strangers  --  SADIE DELANY just like when we were children and Uncle Jesse and all the hoboes would come by and she would always fix them a plate of food . BESSIE DELANY It got so bad that we would rush home from our jobs every day in fear . SADIE DELANY Finally , we decided that one of us was going to have to quit working and take care of Mama . What else could we do ? p. 63 BESSIE DELANY Well , it was obvious that I was the one who should quit my job , even though Sadie was the mama 's child . SADIE DELANY If I continued working until 1960 , I would get $150 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and split three ways , living together , we could manage on that . ( Bessie brings the dry ingredients to Sadie . ) BESSIE DELANY And I was a dentist , working independently , and had no pension plan . So it was settled . I was to close my practice . I was only fifty-nine years old and I had planned to work for many years yet . But once the decision was made , I accepted it . ( Bessie sits . ) Mama had been a perfect housekeeper and I thought that 's what she wanted . She would say , " Bessie , why do n't you just sit down here next to me ? " And I would say , " In a minute , Mama , when I 'm done shaking out the rugs , " or whatever . But she did n't want brass fixtures that gleamed like gold ; she wanted me . She was an old lady and she wanted her child to just sit with her , to be near her . Now that I am very old I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't I just spend more time with Mama ? ( Sadie comforts her , pats her hand . Bessie gets up and crosses to the counter . ) But hard times were coming . First , Manross died of a heart attack on November 3 , 1955 . When it happened , I called Lemuel on the telephone and I said , ( Cracking eggs into a bowl . ) " Lemuel , sit down , I have some bad news . " He said , " OK , I 'm ready . It 's Mama , is n't it ? " I said , " No , it 's Manross . " He just said , " Manross ? Manross ? Manross ? " p. 64 SADIE DELANY Losing Manross was a shock to all of us . He was the first of our generation to die , and we knew there would be more dying because we Delanys tend to die in threes . BESSIE DELANY Strange thing is , it was Lemuel who went to Glory next . SADIE DELANY He died of a heart attack two months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was a terrible blow to poor Mama . ( Bessie gives Sadie the beaten eggs . ) BESSIE DELANY She had n't gotten over Manross yet , and I had to sit her down and tell her about Lemuel , and she cried and cried . ( Sadie folds eggs into cake mix . Bessie sits , pours in vanilla and almond extract . ) SADIE DELANY She was n't just sad , she was kind of angry . I do n't think she ever expected to out-live any of her children . BESSIE DELANY After she lost Manross and Lemuel , I guess it was only natural that Mama was ready to go . But to tell you what a silly old gal I am , I have to admit I did not realize when Mama was leaving us . I did not realize my Mama was dying . The day it happened Mama had been ailing and stayed in bed . Sadie was sitting at the head of the bed , and I was just kind of hovering around . Silly me , I left the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pet dogs and birds . Then Sadie came outside and said , " Bess , Mama 's gone . " Bad as it was for me , Mama 's death was ten times worse for Sadie . Sweet sister Sadie just cried for weeks and weeks . Every time we sat down for a meal , with Mama 's chair sitting there empty , the tears would come streaming down Sadie 's face . Why , I was n't sure she would make it . ( Bessie gets up . She takes the bowls to the sink . ) I 'll tell you something kind of funny . It had annoyed Mama that when Manross died , they made his wife return the pension check he had in his pocket . Mama thought that was mean . So she said to Sadie , " If I die and I have a check in my pocket , you must promise me that you will run to the bank and cash it , and keep that money ! " So , while Mama was ailing , Sadie did just that . And do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? They had seen Mama 's obituary in The New York Times  --  that Bishop Delany 's widow had died  --  and they sent a letter that said , " Please return the last check . " And Sadie wrote to them , " Sorry , but it was cashed . " We always did what Mama asked . ( Bessie exits with a dessert tray . Sadie continues to stir batter , stops. ) p. 65 SADIE DELANY Now , you might ask , what happens to a mama 's child when her Mama passes on ? Well , it was worse than anything . Her passing hurt me something terrible . I was so dependent on my Mama . When I was a grown woman and moved up to New York , I wrote at least one letter every day to my Mama , back in North Carolina . Child , a day did n't go by that I did n't send her a letter , or sometimes two . And after Papa died , and Mama left Raleigh and moved in with me and Bessie , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called me her " shadow . " So when she died I thought , Maybe I should die myself . ( She breaks down . ) I was depressed . ( She gets up . ) But Mama was gone , and I had to think about the world in a completely different way . Bessie says that for the first time in my life , I seemed to come into my own , as an individual person . I was sixty-seven years old . ( Bessie enters . Sadie crosses to the counter to grease a cake pan . ) Since our eldest brother Lemuel had died , and Papa had died long before , Mama 's passing meant I was now the head of the family . There was never a family decision that did n't get brought to me for my opinion . This was hard on Bessie . It was easy for her to let Mama be the boss , but it was hard for her to play second fiddle to me . BESSIE DELANY You 're older than I am , so whatever you decide goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to say that , ( Bessie laughs. ) but she does abide by it . Now , one day , Bessie went to visit our brother Hap at his home in Mount Vernon , in the suburbs . While she was there , Hap 's wife put this idea in Bessie 's head that maybe the two of us ought to get out of the Bronx and move into their neighborhood in Westchester . ( They pour batter into cake pan . ) BESSIE DELANY I did n't think we could afford it , but then I sat down and figured out we could . SADIE DELANY Bessie says now that she had an ulterior motive in moving us out of the Bronx . She says she did n't think I would ever get over Mama 's death , and that maybe by moving away and starting over , it would help . I think she was right . ( Lights fade as Sadie moves to put the cake in the oven. ) p. 67 Act 3 , Scene 2 : Outliving The Rebby Boys Outliving The Rebby Boys Images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosa Parks , the integration of Little Rock , Dr. King 's march from Selma to Montgomery . More images as lights reveal the Delany sisters in the sitting room . It is approaching evening . Bessie places Sadie 's shawl around her shoulders . Sadie helps Bessie put on her jacket . As they finish , the images dissolve and lights go up . SADIE DELANY Today , all of Mount Vernon , it seems , is mostly Negro , but in 1957 , it was mostly white . BESSIE DELANY I do n't think either Sadie or I had ever lived among so many white folks before , and it was a bit of a shock to us . Of course , we were a bit of a shock to them . SADIE DELANY Our brother Hap had broken the neighborhood ; he was the first colored person to move in here . BESSIE DELANY They would n't let him buy a house . SADIE DELANY So do you know what Hap did ? BESSIE DELANY He built a house . SADIE DELANY He just went and bought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicest white neighborhood , and before the neighbors could figure out what was happening , they were pouring the foundation . p. 68 BESSIE DELANY The first time I answered the door at our house in Mount Vernon , it was some white lady from Welcome Wagon and she went on and on about this and that and then she said to me : SADIE DELANY " And be sure you tell the owner " BESSIE DELANY And I said , " Lady , I have news for you . I am the owner . " Well , she just about dropped dead . It was clear she thought I was the maid . SADIE DELANY You know  --  it was during that time , during the civil rights movement when we thought : Maybe now it will finally happen . BESSIE DELANY Maybe now our country will finally grow up , come to terms with this race mess . SADIE DELANY But it seems like the momentum was lost when the Vietnam War happened . BESSIE DELANY It was like all the energy of the young people , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . SADIE DELANY But it was n't just Vietnam that slowed down the progress we made in the civil rights movement  --  BESSIE DELANY It had a lot to do with lack of leadership after Martin Luther King died . SADIE DELANY As far as Bessie and I are concerned , Martin Luther King was an angel ! p. 69 BESSIE DELANY He just dropped from Heaven . SADIE DELANY And there has n't been anyone as special since then . BESSIE DELANY Now , I know that Martin Luther King was not perfect . There are all these stories coming out about him now ; they may not be true at all . SADIE DELANY And if they are ? We never expected him to be perfect . BESSIE DELANY He was a man , after all . I did n't expect him to be Jesus Christ . SADIE DELANY Yes . Things have kind of slid downhill as far as equality is concerned . BESSIE DELANY And the 1980s were the worst yet , yes , sir ! Sadie and I are registered Independents , but we usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he was an honest man , and his heart was in the right place . BESSIE DELANY And I liked Harry Truman . SADIE DELANY You surely liked that " Buck Stops Here " business . BESSIE DELANY I 'll tell you something , honey : I would have made a very good president . That 's right ! Me ! I would have done well . I 'm honest and I 'm tough and I could get the job done , yes , sir ! If I was president , the first thing I would do would be to say that people over one hundred years of age no longer have to pay taxes ! Ha ha ! Lord knows I 've paid my share . But I guess it will be a thousand years  --  probably never  --  before a colored person is elected president of the United States . p. 70 SADIE DELANY There will be a Negro President someday BESSIE DELANY No , no . I think white people would rather die than have a Negro president . I predict there will be a white woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Negro is elected president ? That person will be a Negro woman . SADIE DELANY How do you know that ? BESSIE DELANY I 'm a little psychic . Like with that Clarence Thomas mess , the Supreme Court nomination . He 's lying . That girl , Anita Hill , was telling the truth . And Sadie says , " How do you know that ? " And I say , I know a rascal when I see one ! ( Beat . ) You know , Sadie has taken on this business of getting old like it 's a big project . SADIE DELANY Yes . I started doing yoga exercises about forty years ago . Well , when Bessie turned eighty she decided that I looked better than her . So she decided she would start doing yoga , too . And we 've been doing our exercises together ever since . But , sometimes , Bessie cheats . I 'll be doing an exercise and look over at her , and she 's just lying there ! Bessie is a naughty old gal . BESSIE DELANY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do our yoga , we each take a clove of garlic p. 71 SADIE DELANY Chop it up , and swallow it whole so there 's no odor . BESSIE DELANY We also take a teaspoon of cod liver oil . I think it 's disgusting . SADIE DELANY We eat as many as seven different vegetables a day . Plus lots of fresh fruits . And we take vitamins and minerals . And I make Bessie take tyrosine when she 's a little blue . BESSIE DELANY We eat our big meal of the day at noon . In the evening , we usually have a milk shake for dinner , and then we go upstairs and watch MacNeil Lehrer on the TV . SADIE DELANY After that , we say our prayers . We say prayers in the morning and before we go to bed . It takes a long time to pray for everyone , because it 's a big family and tonight  --  BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together. ) we are going to pray for you . BESSIE DELANY Truth is , we 've gotten so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not long ago , some young men started hanging out in front of our house . They were part of a gang from the Bronx , and they just thought our dead-end street here was a good spot to play basketball and do drugs and I do n't know what-all . SADIE DELANY Yes . Well , Bessie said to me , " I 'll go out there and get rid of them . " And I said , " No , Bess . For once , I 'm going to handle it . You stay in the house . " ( Gets up from her chair . ) So I went on out there and said , " You boys better get out of here . " They were kind of surprised . And then one of them said , " You ca n't make us leave . This is a public street . " And I said , " Yes , it 's a public street , but it 's not a park , so get moving . " And this fella said to me : " Just how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I pointed to my house . I said , " My sister is inside and she has her hand on the phone to call the police . " Of course , this was a little white lie because we do n't have a phone , but they did n't know that . So the leader of this group laughed at me and he said , " You think the police are gon na come when some old woman calls them ? " I said , " Yes , they will come . Because I own this property here , and I own this house , and I pay my taxes . They will come , and they will boot you on out of here . " Well , they left . Bessie was kind of surprised that I took that gang on like that . To tell you the truth , so was I. ( Sadie sits. ) p. 72 BESSIE DELANY Our Grandpa Miliam surely would have been proud of you . ( Sadie laughs . ) I was just thinking about Mr. Miliam this morning . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " Oh , you better be glad Mr. Miliam and his gun ai n't around . ' Cause he 'd shoot you and fry you up for his breakfast . " SADIE DELANY I wonder what Mr. Miliam would think of his granddaughters living this long . BESSIE DELANY I think he 'd get a kick out of it . I know he 'd have lived longer if Grandma had n't died and it broke his heart . SADIE DELANY Sometimes you need a reason to keep living . BESSIE DELANY I would n't be here without you . ( Sadie goes to her , holds her . ) I get the blues sometimes . It 's a shock to me to be this old . Sometimes it hits me right between the eyes . I wake up and say " Oh , Lord , how did this happen ? " Turning one hundred was the worst birthday of my life . I would n't wish it on my worst enemy . Turning 101 was not so bad . ( Sadie pats Bessie 's shoulders , goes back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century mark , it 's just not as shocking . SADIE DELANY Longevity runs in the family . I 'm sure that 's part of why we 're still here . As a matter of fact , until recently there were still five of us , of the original ten children . p. 73 BESSIE DELANY When good ol ' Hap knew he was going to Glory , he was content . He was 95 years old . He said , " I 've had a good life . I 've done everything I wanted to do , I think I 've done right by people . " SADIE DELANY We Delanys can usually say that , when our time comes . BESSIE DELANY ( After a beat . ) Sadie ! You know what I 've been thinking lately ? All those people who were mean to us in our lives SADIE DELANY All those rebby boys  --  BESSIE DELANY Why , they 've turned to dust , and here we are  --  BESSIE AND SADIE ( Together . ) Still here !

Maybe I 'll get into Heaven after all . I do have some redeeming qualities . I may have to hang on to Sadie 's heels , but I 'll get there . SADIE DELANY ( She stands , crosses to us . ) You know , it has been a pleasure speaking with you . Why , I feel like I 've known you all my life . And that 's the truth .
