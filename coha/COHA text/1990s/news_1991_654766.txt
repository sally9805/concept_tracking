<p> WHAT does it take to make a hit movie ? A good cast , a good budget , a good script , a good crew ... and good food . <p> Meals for movie makers are catered . And here in the motion-picture capital of the world , it follows that catering on sets or on location is big business . <p> " It 's like feeding astronauts , " says Douglas Axtell , a sound mixer based here who has worked on many movies . " If you 're at the same location and eating the same food , you get tired of even good food , " he says . <p> A movie caterer 's job is n't easy . Long days ( typically 13 to 16 hours ) . Loads of people ( hundreds , usually - sometimes thousands ) . The same customers day after day ( shooting may last 10 weeks or more ) . Out-of-the-way locations ( it was so cold in Billings , Mont. , during the shooting of " Little Big Man " that the propane lines to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 companies that " cater to the stars , " Michelson Food Services is the largest and oldest , and widely considered one of the best . Recent films to their credit include " Green Card " and " Kindergarten Cop . " <p> Sometimes they provide just lunch , other times breakfast , lunch , dinner , and snacks . Union regulations ( cast and crew must break for food every six hours or producers pay a " meal penalty " ) and being on location necessitate having a food service . <p> Today , vice president Steve Michelson escorts a writer and photographer to one of the motion picture " feeds . " The location is a warehouse in Valencia , about an hour outside of Los Angeles . The movie is " The Doctor , " with William Hurt , Christine Lahti , Elizabeth Perkins , and Mandy Patinkin , to be released by Touchstone Pictures this fall . <p> In the parking lot , a line of crew members and actors inches its way past a truck-cum-kitchen , where two chefs busily serve today 's hot meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sirloin steak with onion and mushroom gravy , grilled Cajun catfish , mashed potatoes , brown rice , candied sweet yams , stuffed papaya with banana squash , steamed fresh vegetables , and peas . The meal was cooked in the truck " from scratch " - enough for 200 people . <p> Set up inside the warehouse are tables and chairs . But that 's not all . Behold a monstrous cold buffet , lavishly decorated , featuring a large salad bar , rolls and butter , soup , a fruit bar ( with hot chocolate mousse for dapping ) , various pies , ice cream with toppings , and beverages . <p> " We 're well-fed , " says Ginger Valdez , an extra who insists on being called by her stage name , " The Hot Tamale . " " I stay fat for free , " she says . <p> " You outdid yourself again , " says another extra , nodding to Mr. Michelson and lumbering by with a heaping plate of food . <p> " Too much " is a common sentiment here : Eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Some say they do n't eat dinner . <p> " This is the way the producer tells the crew : ' We love you . You give us the best and we 'll give you the best , " ' says Michelson . He estimates that today 's meal cost the film company about $12 a plate plus labor , or about $18 altogether . That 's the average price , he says . A typical movie 's food budget is $10,000 a week for 10 weeks . ) <p> " There 's a direct correlation between the quality of the food and the enthusiasm of the crew , " says Edward Feldman , executive producer for " The Doctor " ( his credits include " Green Card " and " Witness " ) . If the producer does nothing else but get the food and the payroll out , he 's done his job , says Mr. Feldman . <p> To keep the show rolling , Michelson 's offers " theme days " that focus on , say , design-your-own omelets , sushi , pasta , or potato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , floats , malts ) . Competition in the industry is tough , he says : " We 're constantly changing . " <p> Nearly 20 percent of the crew goes directly to the salad bar , Michelson estimates . Years ago , " salad " meant cottage cheese , lettuce , and Jell-O . Fish used to be served only on Fridays ( always battered and grilled ) ; now they serve fish all the time , all different ways . Many more actors now consider themselves vegetarians - Kevin Bacon , Dennis Weaver , Lindsay Wagner - while still others adhere to very strict diets , he says , mentioning Albert Brooks , Steve Martin , and Richard Dreyfuss . During the filming of " Cocktail , " " we had to send cases and cases of Evian water down to Jamaica " for Tom Cruise , says Michelson . <p> On location , they cater with regional specialties .

They " understand the idiosyncrasies of film crews , and roll with the punches they throw at you , " he says . <p> Locations might shift 20 miles three times between breakfast and lunch . Times change . " You 've got to pick up and still be ready with fresh , hot food . " Counts change : " They might say 125 people , but 175 show up because they forgot that the mayor and his entourage are visiting , " says Michelson . " The only sure thing is there is no sure thing . " <p> Rolling with production punches can put chefs in the pressure cooker . But chefs like Chef Luis Lara here are pros . " He 's the creme de la creme , " says associate producer Mike Glick , to which Mr. Lara replies : " Holy macaroni !
