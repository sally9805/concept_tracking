<p> Lori Pollard , who once lived in Philadelphia , is designing her dream house on a nearly deserted , environmentally protected barrier-reef island off the coast of Honduras for a fraction of what such a project would cost in the States . <p> This , she says , is retirement . <p> For Pollard , husband Hoss , and hundreds of thousands of other Americans , retirement is not the good life unless it is lived abroad - or , at least , south of the border . <p> Far from the madding crowds , winter snows and high prices , the Pollards plan to spend their old age swaying in the trade winds . <p> All it takes is a pension , some patience and reorganized priorities . <p> Life in some of the hottest retirement sites - Mexico , Costa Rica , Honduras and Belize - moves at a slower pace on potholed roads . <p> Although it is a little cheaper , it is n't free . Retirees in Mexico estimate they spend $ 1,000 to $ 1,500 a month for a comfortable level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month for the frugal . Add to that the cost of trips home and medical care - although Mexico , at least , has inexpensive medical insurance that 's available to Americans . <p> Some items that Americans yearn for may not be available , or may be exorbitantly expensive . A Sunday paper from the States can go for as much as $ 10 , for example . <p> Paradise is in the eye of the beholder . Retirees should not expect a total escape from crime . For example , in the hard times since Mexico 's 1994 peso devaluation , North American retirees have increasingly become targets of burglars and car thieves . <p> Social customs may be uncomfortable ; legal systems may work in unfamiliar ways . Individuals who are chronically unhappy will probably be just as miserable in paradise . <p> Because retiring abroad involves so many momentous changes , the collective advice in an array of books and online sites is this : Be realistic about money , make peace with your priorities , and try it before you buy it . <p> The U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad , but it does n't do a breakdown of retirees . While Americans with ties to places such as Ireland , Poland and Israel may choose to retire there , many retirees say Europe is too expensive . But Mexico has attracted Americans and Canadians for years . <p> The Lake Chapala Society , a service organization for retirees in the Guadalajara area , puts the number of U.S. retirees living in that country at 460,000 . <p> Climate is the big draw , says Don Merwin , the author of Choose Mexico ( Gateway Books ) . Guadalajara , the second-largest city in Mexico , is blessed with eternal spring , he said , and even during the May-to-September rainy season , it rains only at night . <p> Although living in Mexico is relatively inexpensive , " nothing is a bargain if it is not what you want , " Merwin says . <p> In Honduras , " we are paying more for some things , like Internet service , " said Hoss Pollard , 69 , a former TWA pilot who traveled the world before choosing Cayos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper . " <p> His wife , Lori , 55 , also worked for the airline . After seeing much of the world , the Pollards agreed they wanted to live in the tropics . <p> Their island paradise has no purified water or paved roads , and the only access is by boat . But it is , she said , " one of the best diving destinations in the world . " And that 's what 's important to her these days . <p> While their dream house on Cayos Cochinos is under construction , the Pollards are renting a lavish three-bedroom home on the mainland for $ 450 a month . Overall , Hoss Pollard said , their living expenses are half what they 'd be in Tennessee , their last U.S. address . <p> On the downside , Lori Pollard misses certain fresh produce . <p> " One of the things I miss the most is that we ca n't get fresh leaf lettuce down here often enough , " she said . <p> On the other hand , she said , " we have great lobster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rose was following her mother 's example when she moved to Morelia , midway between Mexico City and Guadalajara . <p> Her mother was 70 when she retired a decade ago to the small , artsy town , where mansions abut hovels . <p> During those years , Rose says , she could afford to pay for good home care for her mother , care that would have been too expensive in the States . <p> Her mother died a year ago , and Rose , 46 , quit her legal practice and moved to Morelia herself . She works as an online magazine editor , moderates the Mexico Connect online discussion forum at ( www.mexcon-nect.com ) , and frequently gets inquiries from prospective retirees . <p> " I recommend locating somewhere near a major airport , " so relatives can visit , Rose said . " And I tell them that I love it here . I absolutely do . It 's a real lifestyle change - getting used to the dirt and the smell - but that 's the trade-off for being in a place where roses bloom year-round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Computer equipment and small appliances are best bought in the States , and many retirees schedule an annual shopping trip back home . <p> Medical care is a mixed bag . <p> A country such as Mexico , with a large and well-established population of Americans and Canadians , will have world-class hospitals and specialists . In a less-developed country such as Belize , a retiree might have to be airlifted to the States for medical treatment , Hoss Pollard said . <p> Paying for care is another issue . The State Department cautions that Medicare does not cross foreign borders . That 's not a problem in Mexico , where Mexican National Health Insurance is available to U.S. retirees for about $ 250 a year . <p> Crime is virtually inescapable , and immunity from U.S. taxes is n't guaranteed . <p> The U.S. government 's Office of Consular Affairs keeps track of crime abroad and issues warnings when necessary . <p> In January , the office warned that in Costa Rica organized bands of squatters were seizing the property of foreigners and that a U.S. citizen had been killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rash of robberies by taxi drivers in Mexico City and the slaying of a U.S. citizen there in December . <p> In April , a 40-year-old Connecticut woman was raped and drowned as she took a midday stroll along the beach in Puerto Escondido , Mexico , a popular Pacific Coast resort . <p> Retirees abroad may have to pay U.S. income taxes , too . What they owe will depend on whether they have earned income , and on the tax treaty between the United States and their country of residence . <p> Remember too , that legal systems are different outside the United States . Do n't expect to be exempt from local laws or customs , says Scott Michael Young , a former Hollywood executive who retired to Mexico three years ago . <p> Young , 60 , lives in Ajijic ( pronounced ah-HEE-heek ) , a 478-year-old fishing village on the shore of Lake Chapala in the Sierra Madre of western Mexico . <p> He lives in a four-bedroom , two-bath house with a flowered courtyard that he bought two years ago for $ 62,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , Los Angeles and major European cities , Young said he was glad to trade it all for " peace , tranquility and sanity " on about $ 1,500 a month . <p> " What do I miss ? Not a thing , " Young said . " And it 's amazing how many people want to visit you when you live in a place like this . " <p> Merwin and others say missing the grandchildren is the reason most often cited by retirees who return to the States . <p> Lori Pollard , who has no children , said , " If we had grandchildren , I do n't know that we would have done the same thing .
