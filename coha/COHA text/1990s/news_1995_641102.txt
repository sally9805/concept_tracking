<p> The time may come when you can pop a pill every morning and then have as much fun in the sun as you can stand , without any of the usual worry about skin damage and premature aging . <p> Madhukar A. Pathak , a Harvard Medical School researcher , has spent two years in the lab working on just such a concept : an oral sunscreen . <p> He thinks it can work . <p> By taking a " sunscreen " pill every day , a person would build up levels of a substance that would block out harmful ultraviolet radiation . It would be like like taking a vitamin every morning . <p> But his research is stymied so far by the fact that his early tests on people show he can only achieve a sun protection factor ( SPF ) of about 3 or 4 , far below the minimum SPF 15 in topical sunscreens that is recommended by doctors . And people produce varying protective levels of sunscreen . For example , one person might get only an SPF 2 from the pill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Then there 's the big roadblock : money . Pathak says it would cost more money than he has to test and market an oral sunscreen . Because the pill would produce a systemic reaction in the body , like a medicine , Food and Drug Administration approval would be required . <p> " I 'm just a poor researcher , " said Pathak in a phone interview . But he believes " a big company with money " could allow him to work out those bugs . <p> Earlier this year Pathak spoke at a Skin Cancer Foundation conference on the future of sunscreens . He talked about what 's on the drawing board , like formulas that contain antioxidants designed to neutralize or inactivate the " free radicals " that cause cell damage on the skin . <p> Some products already boast of that addition , but Consumer Reports , which tested sunscreens for its May issue , said " it 's not known what benefit , if any , ( antioxidants ) confer in a sunscreen . " <p> Pathak said such a concept is workable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to allow the antioxidants to penetrate the skin and do their work has been difficult . <p> Other sunscreen manufacturers continue to come up with slogans and so-called " new and improved " ingredients that they say will better protect our skin from the sun . One of this year 's entries is Sun Health , which contains something called " Nayasol , " described by the company as " an all-natural plant extract recently patented as a photoprotectant . " <p> The company claims the " new technology provides substantially increased protection to the skin 's immune system from damage caused by ultraviolet radiation . " <p> That makes it sound like some sort of magic bullet that targets the immune system , but a University of Colorado associate professor of dermatology said he does n't believe the product is " anything new . " <p> Dr. Ramsey Mellette , who is director of the Mohs ( Skin Cancer ) Surgery Unit at CU Health Sciences Center , said researchers believe the harmful effect of UV radiation is done in two ways : by direct damage to the DNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . <p> But any sunscreen , by blocking out the UV rays , will end up protecting against that damage that seems to be done to the immune system . So Mellette said the Nayasol ingredient that promises to specifically protect the immune system probably does what any other sunscreen does and is probably a marketing tool . <p> " Any time I hear the term ' all-natural plant extract , ' I start looking for snake oil , " said Mellette . The Nayasol is actually an extract made from dried baker 's yeast , according to information from ImmuDyne , the company that markets Sun Health products . <p> Another technique of sunscreen manufacturers is to up the SPF ante , devising formulas that brag of a 40 or even 50 sun protection factor . While some very sun-sensitive and fair-skinned people might benefit from those higher numbers , doctors recommend an SPF of from 15 to 18 for the majority of people . <p> An SPF of 15 , for example , means a person who normally would burn - that is , their skin turn barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimal erythemal dose - in , say , 40 minutes could spend 15 times more than that safely in the sun . <p> That would be 600 minutes , or 10 hours . Consider , then , that an SPF of 50 for that same person would provide 2,000 minutes , or 33 hours , of protection - more than there is in a day . But a person whose MED is only 10 minutes might need the 50 SPF product to provide nine or 10 hours of protection . <p> Sunscreen with 30 SPF is often recommended for use on children . <p> But can you trust what those numbers advertise ? The Consumer Reports test found that " most sunscreens work well - but a few could leave you burned . " <p> The magazine tested 38 sunscreens , from name brands to cheaper drugstore products . It found that a few did n't offer as much waterproofing as they claimed ; once a person got in the water , protection did n't last as long as advertised . <p> The magazine says whatever sunscreen you use , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - more than most people generally use . <p> A sunscreen ingredient that was touted a few years ago , PABA , was found to irritate many users , so it generally is n't used anymore , said the magazine . But some products use a relative of that compound , called padimate , that still might irritate some skin . <p> And what 's old may be new again . Remember that white stuff lifeguards used to plaster across their noses ? <p> Opaque , or visible , sunblocks in the form of titanium dioxide or zinc oxide are back , and some companies now make them in neon fashion colors . <p> These work by blocking or scattering the UV rays . <p> CU 's Mellette said the sunscreen industry " has n't grown by leaps and bounds , " and about the only new thing he sees this year is the return of those opaque blocks . <p> He recommends a broad-spectrum sunscreen - that is , one that protects against both ultraviolet A and B rays - with an SPF of at least 15 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest obstacles health professionals face in protecting people from sun damage : the desire for a tan and the reluctance to apply proper amounts of sunscreen on a regular basis . <p> Last year Texas researchers released a study saying that sunscreen did n't retard growth of malignant melanoma in mice who were exposed to ultraviolet light . <p> But the Skin Cancer Foundation and numerous doctors leaped to the defense of sunscreens , noting that the Texas study could n't reliably be extrapolated from mice to people . The foundation also noted that numerous other studies have found sunscreen does help prevent melanoma , as well as basal and squamous cell cancers , along with actinic keratoses , which are premalignant lesions . <p> Even the authors of the Texas study urged people to continue to use sunscreen regularly and to avoid UV exposure in peak sun hours between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m . <p> Pathak , the Harvard researcher , thinks sunless tanners - the so-called " tan-in-a-bottle " - are a good alternative for those who want the look of " brown skin . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 or more , so that you 're protected against sun damage when you do go outside , he said . <p> He also advocates better education of children and adolescents , who are most at risk because they spend the most time outdoors . Pathak would like to see warnings of what the sun can do placed in all recreational areas , like swimming pools and outdoor sporting events , the way warnings about tobacco appear in ads and on bulletin boards . <p> " This is my concern this is how you protect people . We have to educate them , both to stay out of the sun but to protect themselves when they are in it , a double-barreled approach , " said Pathak . <p> For a free brochure on sun protection , send a long , self-addressed stamped envelope to the Skin Cancer Foundation , Box 561 , Dept .
