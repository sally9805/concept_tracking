Those readers who have already discovered the work of James P. Blaylock ( his many novels include The Paper Grail , Homunculus , The Digging Leviathan , and most recently Winter Tides ) know that his fantasies show a keen appreciation of life 's oddities and eccentricities . The following novelet , which was published in a limited edition by A.S.A.P. a few months ago , marks Mr. Blaylock 's first appearance in these pages . It 's a pleasure to introduce you to Doyle jimmerson and the unusual truths that await him in the old curiosity shop . <p> THE TRIP DOWN FROM Seattle in the rattling old Mercury wagon took most of two days . Jimmerson tried to sleep for a few hours somewhere south of Mendocino along Highway 1 , the Mercury parked on a turnout and Jimmerson wedged in between the spare tire , his old luggage , and some cardboard boxes full of what amounted to his possessions . None of it was worth any real money . It was just trinkets , souvenirs of his forty years married to Edna : some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dusty agates and geodes from a couple of trips to the desert back in " 56 , old postcards and photographs , a pair of clipper ship bookends they 'd bought down in New Orleans at the Jean Lafitte Hotel , and a few books , including the Popular Science Library set that Edna had given him for Christmas a hell of a long time ago . Most of the rest of what he owned he had left in Seattle , and every mile of highway that spun away behind him made it less and less likely that he would ever return for it . News of Edna 's death had reached him yesterday in the form of a letter from the county , identifying Doyle Jimmerson as " responsible for the costs incurred by Edna Jimmerson 's burial . " And of course he was responsible - for more than just the costs . They were married , even if he had n't seen her for nearly a year , and she had no other kin . He would have thought that Mrs. Crandle , the next door neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death sooner , but Mrs. Crandle was a terrible old shrew , and probably she hated him for how he had left , how he had stayed away .... He had never felt more married to Edna than now that she was dead . His long-cherished anger and all his tired principles had fallen to dust on the instant of his reading the letter , and as he lay listening to the slow dripping of the branches and the shifting of the dark ocean beyond the car windows , he knew that he had simply been wrong  --  about Edna 's fling with the Frenchman , Mr. des Laumes , about his own self-righteous staying-away , about his looking down on Edna from the self-satisfied height of a second-story hotel room along the waterfront in Seattle where he had lived alone these past twelve months . There was a fog in off the ocean , and as he lay in the back of the Mercury he could hear waves sighing in the distance . The eucalyptus trees along the roadside were ghostly dark through the mists , the ocean an invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardboard and old leather on the air , and water dripped onto the roof of the car from overhanging branches . Now and then a truck passed , gunning south toward San Francisco , and the Mercury swayed on its springs and the fog whirled and eddied around the misty windows . Before dawn he was on the road again , driving south along the nearly deserted highway . Fog gave way to rain , and the rugged Pacific coast was black and emerald under a sky the color of weathered iron . It was late afternoon when he pulled into the driveway and cut the engine , which dieseled for another twenty seconds before coughing itself silent . He sat there in the quiet car , utterly unsure of himself-unsure even why he had come . He could far easier have sent a check . And he was helpless now , worthless , no good to poor Edna , who was already dead and buried .... Of course Mrs. Crandle had n't sent him a letter . He was n't worth a letter . He wondered if the old woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he bent over and looked at the front of her house . There she was , a shadow behind the drapery , peering out at him . He could picture her face , pruned up like one of those dolls they make out of dried fruit . He waved at her , and then , before he got out of the car , he opened the glove compartment and looked for a moment at the blue steel .38 that lay atop the road maps and insurance papers and old registrations . The gun appeared to him to be monumentally heavy , like a black hole in the heart of the old Mercury . He shut the glove compartment door , climbed stiffly out of the car , and took a look at the house and yard . The dichondra lawn was up in dandelions and devil grass , and the hibiscus were badly overgrown , dropping orange blossoms onto the grass and walkway . The house needed paint . He had been meaning to paint it when he 'd left , but he had n't . Things had happened too fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had told Edna before he had walked out . He headed up along the side of the house , where a litter of throwaway newspapers and front-porch advertisements lay sodden with rain , hidden in front of Edna 's Dodge . Someone , probably Mrs. Crandle , had been tossing them there . The right front tire of the Dodge was flat , and it looked like it had been for a long time . Instantly it occurred to him that Edna must have been sick for some time , that she had n't been able to get around , but he pushed it out of his mind and continued toward the back door , only then spotting the box springs and mattress tilted against the fence by the garage . Someone had covered it with a plastic dropcloth to save it from the weather , but the sight of it there behind the cloudy plastic was disorienting , and he felt as if he had been away forever . The house was closed up now , the curtains drawn , and he had to jiggle his key in the lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he stepped in onto the linoleum floor after wiping his feet carefully on the mat . At once he felt the emptiness of the house , as if it were hollow , reverberating with his footsteps . He walked as silently as he could through the service porch and into the kitchen , where the tile counter was empty of anything but a glass tumbler still partly full of water . He reached for it in order to pour it into the sink , but then let it alone and went out into the dining room , straightening a chair that was out of place at the table . The old oriental carpet was nearly threadbare outside the bedroom door ( Edna had always wanted him to step past it , so as not to wear it out before its time ) and seeing it now , that footworn patch of rug , he felt the sorrow in the house like a weight . He listened at the bedroom door and allowed himself to imagine that even now she sat inside , reading in the chair by the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her he was sorry , straighten things out once and for all . If only he had a chance to explain himself ! He reached for the doorknob , hesitated , dizzy for a moment with the uncanny certainty that all the emptiness in the house was drifting out from within that single room , wafting under the door , settling on the furniture , on the carpets , on the lampshades and books like soot in a train yard . Setting his teeth , he turned the knob and pushed open the door , peering carefully inside . Very nearly everything was as he remembered : the chairs by the window , the long bookcase on the wall , their bird's-eye maple chests , the cedar trunk at the foot of the bed . He walked in , crossing the floor to the bedside table . On top of it lay a glass paperweight , a silver spoon , and a faded postcard with a picture of a boardwalk on it - Atlantic City ? Jimmerson almost recognized it . He had been there before ; he and Edna had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translucent glass , clouded by milky swirls . He could almost see a face in the swirls , but when it occurred to him that it was Edna 's face , he set it down again and turned to the bottom shelf of the table . A liqueur glass sat there . There was a greenish residue in the bottom , an oily smear , which smelled vaguely of camphor and juniper and weeds . He set the glass down and forced himself to look at the bed . It was a single bed now , and although it was n't a hospital bed , there were cloth and Velcro restraints affixed to the frame - wrist and ankle restraints both . HE RANG Mrs. Crandle 's doorbell , then stood back a couple of steps so as not to push her . She opened the door wide - no peering through the crack - and the look on her face held loathing and indifference both . " So you 've come back , " she said flatly . Her white hair hung over her forehead in a wisp , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've come back . " " Now that Edna 's dead you 've come back to take her things . " She nodded when she said this , as if it stood to reason . " Our things , Mrs. Crandle , " he said unwisely . " You have no claim , " she said , cutting him off . " You walked out on that poor woman and left her to that ... parlor rat . You might as well have killed her yourself . You did kill her . As sure as you 're standing here now , Doyle jimmerson , you took the breath of life right out of that poor woman . " She stated at him , and for a moment he thought she was going to slam the door in his face . " I did n't kill her , Mrs. Crandle . After forty years of marriage she chose another man , and I .... " " She chose nothing , " Mrs. Crandle said . " She met a man who was a conversationalist , unlike some men I could name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the handle . What did she want for herself but some of the finer things in life ? - a nice dinner now and then at the French Caf6 instead of once a month at the Steer Inn . You 're beer and skittles , Doyle Jimmerson , but a little bit of Edna wanted a glass of champagne . That 's all she wanted , Mr. Jimmerson , if you 're capable of taking my meaning . And when she stood up for herself , you walked out , as if she was having some kind of affair . " " A conversationalist ? That 's what he was ? I can think of a couple of other terms that are n't half as polite . Even you called him a parlor rat . Him and his stinking chin whiskers , his damned champagne . I could n't stand it . I told her what I 'd do before I 'd stand it . " But even when he said it he knew it was false . Anyone can stand anger . He could simply have thrown his anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another matter , not so easy to throw out . What had Edna suffered ? The question silenced him . " Yes , I did call him a rat , " Mrs. Crandle said evenly . " And I 'll just remind you that you abandoned your wife to that creature , even though you knew what he was . You could n't take him , so you left Edna to take him . And she found out too late , did n't she ? All of us did . Now she 's dead and you 've come down here to gloat . You won the war . To the victor go the spoils , eh ? " " I 'm not the victor , Mrs. Crandle . I did n't win . " " No , you did n't , Mr. Jimmerson . You lost something more than you know . " He nodded his agreement . He could n't argue with that . " What do you mean she found out " too late ' ? Did the Frenchman have anything to do with ... ? " " Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more nor less than you had . " " Help me out here , Mrs. Crandle . Edna ... she would n't tell me much . " " Well I 'll tell you a thing or two . You went inside that house just now , that house where you yourself should have been living this last long year . And so maybe you 've seen the room where she died . I was with her there in the last couple of weeks . I stayed by her . " " I thank you for that . " She looked at him in silence for a moment , as if she were tired of him . " you saw the bed ? " " I saw the bed , Mrs. Crandle . I saw the restraints . " " There was almost nothing left of her there at the end . That 's all I can tell you . And I mean nothing . She was empty , Mr. Jimmerson , like something made out of sea foam . Any gust of wind might have blown her into the sky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... she would start to drift away , poor thing . " " The moon ... " he said , not quite comprehending . The word " lunacy " leaped into his mind . He pictured that lonely bed again , Mrs. Crandle sitting in Edna 's seat by the window , knitting and knitting while Edna drifted away , strapped to the bed frame , their old double bed out in the driveway , going to bits in the weather . " She ... When she called the last couple of times she sounded a little confused . Like she had lost track of things , you know . She even forgot who I was , who she had called . I guess I just did n't grasp that . " " That 's a crying shame . " " Worse than that . I was pretty sure of myself , Mrs. Crandle-sure that I was in the right . What I mean is that I was so damned self-righteous that I put top spin on everything she said . Heaven help me I even twisted what she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was what I thought at the time , but she does n't know her own damned husband of forty years . Hell , " he said , and he rubbed has face tiredly , conscious now that rain was starting to fall again pattering against the porch roof . " I guess I thought she was trying to get my goat . " " And so you got mad again . You hung up the phone . " " I did . I got mad . I was a damned fool , Mrs. Crandle , but there 's not a thing that I can do about it now . " " Well you 're right about that , anyway , if it 's any consolation to you . " " Tell me about it , then . Was it Alzheimer 's ? , " " I 'm sure I do n't know . I 'm not certain it was in the medical books at all . It was a wasting disease . That 's all I can tell you . Sorrow did it . Sorrow and abandonment . Gravity weighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looked like it would crush her , she did what she had to do . She made herself light . That 's the only truth you 'll find down here . I ca n't tell you anything more than that . " Mrs. Crandle swung the door nearly shut now , and he shoved his foot against the jamb to block it . " Where is she , Mrs. Crandle ? You can tell me that much . " " Over at Angel 's Flight , " she said through the nearly closed door . " They buried her last week . No service of course , except for the Father from up at the Holy Childhood . He said a few words alongside the grave , but it was just me and a couple of the others from the old bridge club . I suppose you can get over there tonight and make your peace if you want to . Or leastwise you can try to make your peace . I hope you can find the words . " She shut the door firmly now , against his shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerk his foot out before slamming it shut again . He had n't gotten anything out of her except bitterness , which was as much as he deserved . He headed down the porch steps , realizing that he had n't really wanted to know about the bed restraints . What he wanted to know was what had gone through her mind while he was sitting full of self-pity up in Seattle . What she had thought about him , about the long years that they were married , what her loneliness felt like . He had lost her for a year , and he wanted that year back , along with all the rest that he had n't paid any attention to . No matter that it was bound to be a Pandora 's box , full of sorrow and demons , and perhaps without Hope at the bottom , either . Evening had fallen , with big clouds scudding across the sky in a wild race , the rain falling steadily now . He headed up Magnolia Street through the downpour . The street lamps were on , haloed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with water . Living rooms and front porches were lighted , and he saw a man and a woman looking out through a big picture window at the front of one of the houses , watching the rain the way people sit and watch a fire in a fireplace . He thought of where he would sleep tonight and knew that it would n't be among the dusty ghosts in the house ; the back of the Mercury would be good enough for him , parked in the driveway , despite what Mrs. Crandle would think and what it would do to his back . Where Lemon dead-ended into Marigold , he turned up through the big wrought iron gates of the cemetery , and drove slowly toward the stone building nearly hidden in the shade of a cluster of vast trees . Vines climbed the walls of the three-story granite mausoleum , and light shone out from within a deep lamp-lit portico in the tower that served as an entry . There was a second high tower at the rear of the building , lit by lamps hidden on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hundreds of wall niches set with tiny doors . A stone stairway spiraled upward around it , and rainwater washed down the stairs now as if it were a mountain cataract . Beyond the tower lay a hundred feet of lawn strewn with headstones , and beyond that a walnut grove stretched away into the darkness , the big white-trunked walnut trees mostly empty of leaves . Above the shadowy grove the moon shone past the edge of a cloud . Jimmerson angled the Mercury into a parking stall , cut the engine , and sat watching for another moment as an owl flew out of the grove and disappeared beneath the eaves of the tower . He got out of the car , slammed the door , and hunched through the rain , ducking in under the portico roof where he rang the bell . He heard footsteps inside , and the arched door opened slowly to reveal a high-ceilinged room with stone floors and dark wood paneling . The man in the doorway was tall and thin , with a stretched , Lincolnesque face and a rumpled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelled of gardenias , and the man swung the door shut against the rain . " It 's a hellish night , " he said , and he nodded at Jimmerson . " I 'm George Gladstone . " " Doyle Jimmerson , Mr. Gladstone . I 'm glad to meet you . " " I see . You must be Edna Jimmerson 's ... ? " " Husband . " He felt like a fraud . " I was in Seattle when I heard . On business . I drove straight down . " " I 'm certain you got here as quickly as you could , Mr. Jimmerson , and welcome to Angel 's Flight . " A long sideboard stood against the far wall of the room , and on top of the sideboard was a bowl of floating gardenia blossoms and an iron clock . The sound of the ticking clock filled the mausoleum . A gilt-framed painting hung above the sideboard depicting a man and a woman dressed in robes , ascending into heaven in defiance of gravity . An arched door stood open in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there above it more people were ascending , tiny wingless angels rising into the sky against the blue of the ocean . " Very nice picture , " Jimmerson said . And he peered more closely at the door in the clouds , at the light that shone from beyond it . There was something in the spiral brush strokes that looked like eyes , hundreds of them , staring out from heaven at the world of the living . " We like to think of ourselves as a celestial depot , Mr. Jimmerson . " " That 's a comforting thought . " He turned his back on the painting . I wonder if I could see ... Edna 's grave . My wife . I realize it 's late , and the weather and all ... " " Yes , of course you can . " " You do n't have to take any trouble . If you 'll just show me the way ... " " No trouble at all , Mr. Jimmerson . Give me a moment and I 'll see to the equipage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display of coffins was laid out , the coffins set into niches along a stone wall , all of them tilted up at the head end to better show them off . Light shone down on them from candle-flame bulbs in iron chandeliers high above in the ceiling , but the light was dim and the room full of shadows cast by the coffins and by the complex framework of iron that supported them . Jimmerson looked them over , vaguely and shamefully wondering which sort Edna had been buried in - nothing expensive , probably . They were apparently arranged in order of extravagance . A simple coffin-shaped pine box lay nearest the door , the two-piece lid nailed tight on the bottom and hinged open at the top to reveal a quilted satin lining within . There was a fancier box next to it - some sort of exotic veneer with chrome hardware , and next to that a white-lacquered box with gold handles and a round glass viewing window . Jimmerson stepped across to it and looked in through the porthole , then gasped and trod back when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pale and thin and with his coat collar too high on his neck . He forced himself to take another look , and he saw this time that it was a display dummy , its hair very neatly combed and its cheeks rouged . A fly had gotten inside somehow and died , and it lay now on the white satin pillow alongside the dummy 's head . It occurred to him that he ought to point the fly out to Gladstone , just for the sake of friendliness , but Gladstone had utterly disappeared , and the mausoleum was silent but for the ticking of the entryway clock . Jimmerson ran his hand over the polished ebony of the next casket , and then walked along past a half dozen more - gold-leafed , inlaid , and carved and with handles and hasps and doodads of silver and ivory . There was an Egyptian sarcophagus , the lid thrown back and supported by a heavy-linked chain . The raised image on the lid was of a pharaoh-looking robed man with a conical beard , his arms crossed , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held a richly painted ankh and a striped serpent , and within the casket , tilted against a brass easel , lay an explanatory placard suggesting that instead of a pharaoh , the image of your loved one might be fashioned on the lid , holding anything at all in his hands - a favorite tie , a fountain pen , a golf club . The casket was extra wide , the paneled sides fit with slots that contained a pair of decorative flasks and a cut crystal tumbler . There were other slots left empty , book-size cubbyholes and a sliding glass panel suitable for a framed photograph . " All the comforts of home , " Gladstone said , coming into the room . " Room at the foot end for a companion as well . Mr. Hemming , the car dealer from Santa Ana , was interred with his dog . " " They killed the dog ? " Jimmerson asked , horrified . " Oh heavens no . The dog died of grief . It 's not at all uncommon . Dogs are particularly sensitive that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he intended the comment to make some sort of point , a not very obscure point , and then he said , " Perhaps you 'd like to see a little something . " Jimmerson followed him out of the room , back toward the rear of the mausoleum where their footsteps echoed down a long corridor lit with flickering wall sconces . There were heavy wooden doors in the stone walls on either side . Gladstone stopped at one of the doors , removed a skeleton key from his pocket , and unlocked the bolt , swinging it open on its hinges to reveal a room containing half a dozen steel tables . A cord emerged from a slot at the bottom of one of the tables , and floating like a helium balloon some few feet from the ceiling , tethered by its foot to the cord , was what appeared to be a shroud-draped human corpse , its face and bare feet exposed to the dim light of the room . Jimmerson at first took it for another dummy , and he glanced at the ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stared at it , uncomprehending , but then with a growing certainty that the thing 's pale flesh and stringy hair was in fact the flesh and hair of a dead man . Gladstone stepped across and tugged on the cord , which wound down into the table . The corpse descended a couple of feet and then floated slowly upward again when he let go of the cord , its feet swinging around in a clockwise direction , then back again . " He 'll come down on his own fairly soon , " Gladstone said , seeing the look on Jimmerson 's face . " These cases always do . It takes about twelve hours for the spirit to flee the body after death , and then the remains are earthbound once again . Often there 's nothing left but a paper shell , easily inflatable if the family wants an open casket funeral . " " What ... what on earth did he die of ? " " A broken heart , Mr. Jimmerson . I 'll tell you that plainly . Medical science calls it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Which they do n't , for the most part . It 's utterly beyond the grasp of medicine . These are matters of the spirit , by and large . And it 's rare , I can assure you , that we get two such advanced cases in a single week . " He stared at Jimmerson again , who suddenly remembered the restraints on Edna 's deathbed . What had Mrs. Crandle said about Edna 's " drifting away " ? Had she been speaking literally ... ? " Was Edna ... ? " Gladstone nodded slowly , and Jimmerson leaned against the plaster wall to steady himself . " She 's out of harm 's way now , " Gladstone said , patting Jimmerson 's arm . " Let 's have a look at her grave , shall we ? " He led the way down the corridor again , Jimmerson stumbling along after him , until they came out into a sort of stone gardener 's shed with a lean-to roof . Mud-caked spades and shovels stood tilted against the wall , and a steel backhoe scoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismantled engine , greasy pistons and bolts and hoses dumped haphazardly on the ground . Two yellow rain slickers hung from hooks by the door , and Gladstone stepped over the engine parts and took them down , handing one to Jimmerson . It had an attached hat with a wide brim , and the coat itself hung to Jimmerson 's knees . Gladstone passed him a black umbrella , then opened the door and stepped out into the rain , which was falling more lightly now . Jimmerson followed him along a narrow stone path , hoisting his umbrella against the mist and turning it into the wind , which gusted through the trees , sweeping down a litter of dead oak leaves that whirled away across the grounds . The night smelled of wet leaves and clay , and the moon shone between the clouds , the headstones casting long shadows on the grass . The path wound in a wide circle toward the walnut grove , past a lily-choked fish pond and a cluster of mossy concrete benches . Gladstone finally stopped at the edge of a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered a tiny grave . They stood silently for a moment . " It 's awfully small , " Jimmerson whispered at last . Gladstone nodded . " It 's not uncommon , " he said , " that a dwindler can fit into a casket the size of shoe box , once the spirit has flown . And it 's not without its advantages , I suppose , when all is said and done . Very conservative burial , spacially speaking . " " Will there be a headstone ? " Jimmerson asked . " I guess it 's up to me to order one . " " One should arrive from the stonecutters late next week , actually . It was paid for by a Mr. des Laumes , I believe the name was . French gentleman . You must have known him . " Gladstone gave him a sidewise glance , then looked quickly away . " Cancel the order , " Jimmerson told him . " It 's too late for that , " Mr. Jimmerson . " The work 's underway . Very elaborate , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want simple . This Frenchman 's got no right to order a headstone . Who gave him permission to shove his oar in ? " " Permission , Mr. Jimmerson ? In the absence of any other offering ... " He shrugged helplessly . " Of course , now that you 've returned ... " " That 's right . Now that I 've come home Mr. des Laumes 's headstone can go to hell . If the work 's already started , then I 'll pay for it . Mr. des Laumes can have it back with interest , too - on top of his head . " " As you wish , sir , " Gladstone said . " It only has to snow once before I get the drift . " He nodded and winked , shook Jimmerson 's hand , and then moved off down the path again , heading back toward the mausoleum . Jimmerson stayed by the graveside , forcing himself to simmer down . By God , he would n't let this Frenchman give him another moment of grief , not one more moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck him suddenly that he ought to have brought flowers , something ... a keepsake of some sort . His boxes of stuff were still in the Mercury , and he looked out across the hundred yards of rainy night toward the shadowy station wagon , picturing the clusters of quartz crystals they 'd brought home from Death Valley and the pair of conical ceramic tornadoes from Edna 's family reunion back in Kansas . But what would he do with them ? - scatter salt and pepper shakers across the grave like amulets ? He knelt in the grass and ran his hand over the wet squares of turf fitted over the grave , and he felt the freshening rain patter against his slicker . He did n't bother with the umbrella now , but pulled the hat brim down over his forehead , closed his eyes , and tried to pray . Prayer did n't come easily . He tried again , trying to concentrate , to focus , but almost at once he doubted his own sincerity , and the prayer fell to pieces . His father had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was drunk , and although Jimmerson was n't a drinking man , he had enough experience to take his meaning . Now it seemed to him that a guilty man had an even more precarious time praying than a drunken man , and for a long time his mind went round and round with partly formed apologetic phrases , half of them addressed to Edna , half addressed to the sky , until finally he shoved the hat back off his head and knelt in the rain with his forehead in his hands , utterly defeated . He looked up finally to find the moon high in the sky , free of the walnut grove now . Down by the fish pond there was the shadow of Gladstone waiting patiently in his yellow slicker on one of the concrete benches . jimmerson rose to his feet , his knees creaking beneath him , and walked carefully downhill to the path , where he looked back at Edna 's grave . She would n't speak to him . She could n't . She had gone on . Jimmerson stood once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he had just signed the work order for Edna 's headstone  --  her true headstone , a simple granite slab : loving wife of Doyle Jimmerson , marriage date as well as birth and death . Jimmerson had contracted for the plot adjacent to hers , too , and paid for a twin headstone for himself . " I 'm afraid I still do n't entirely understand Edna 's death , " he said , standing finally in the open doorway . " No less than I do , perhaps , " Gladstone told him . " These deaths are always a mystery - the secret of the deceased , you know . I 'm familiar with the physical manifestations at the end , of course , but the progress of the disease itself is not in my province . " Jimmerson nodded . " So it 's not a virus ? It 's not something she caught ? " " Caught ? " He shook his head . " No more than you 'd say that a fish catches a baited hook . Rather the other way around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Let 's just say that voluntary dwindling is n't entirely voluntary , Mr. Jimmerson . It 's voluntary in the main , of course . As I understand it , no one dwindles unless he chooses to dwindle . But the process can be ... facilitated perhaps . Suggested . " " Facilitated how ? " The Frenchman 's face leaped into his mind again , complete with the fact of Mrs. Crandle 's apparently despising the man . He had been right ! - the man was a cad ; although the knowledge of having been right looked like damnation to him . Had he left Edna to some sort of murderer ? " I 'm rather at a loss , " Gladstone said . " It 's my policy to know nothing more than it pays me to know . I might be able to help you , though , although the word " help ' .... " He shook his head . " I 'd appreciate that , Mr. Gladstone . Anything you can do for me . " Gladstone stared at him again , narrowing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , tethered to the cord ... ? " " Yes , of course . " " He told me much the same thing once , not so very long age . Death of an old friend , in this case . They 'd had some kind of sad falling out and had n't spoken in years . So I 'll caution you to be particularly careful of what you learn , Mr. Jimmerson . And I 'll tell you that Mr. des Laumes has purchased more than one headstone in his day . " WITH THE HELP of Gladstone 's map , Jimmerson found the curiosity shop downtown . It was near the Plaza , and from the sidewalk the shop was apparently empty . The linoleum floor was cracked and buckled , scattered with yellowed newsprint and empty White Rock and Nehi soft drink bottles that had n't been sold in grocery stores for years . The windows were hung with cobweb , and the broad sills were covered with a heavy layer of dust and dead bugs and a litter of old business cards . Jimmerson and Edna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtown . Leases near the Plaza were at a premium , yet the shop had gone untenanted since either of them could remember . As he stood outside , looking in at the window , it seemed to him that the place had a curious perspective to it . He could n't quite tell how deep it was . The walls were hung with mirrors , dim with dust , and the hazy reflections , depending upon where he stood , made the store appear sometimes to be prodigiously deep , sometimes to be a space so narrow that it might have been one-dimensional , cleverly painted on the window glass . The front door , weathered and paint-scaled , was nailed shut , and a number of envelopes had been dumped through the brass mail slot over the years , many of them with long out-of-date postage stamps . Gladstone 's map led him around the corner , past a Middle Eastern deli and a shop selling Italian antiques . The day was windy , the sky full of tearing clouds , and Jimmerson pulled his coat tightly around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the mouth of the alley that Gladstone had assured him lay at the back of the old buildings . There was the smell of Turkish coffee in the air , and of wet sidewalks and open Dumpsters , and he walked straight past the alley before he knew it . It was n't really an alley as such , but was a circular doorway in the brick facade of the buildings , and it opened into a sort of courtyard , a patch of gray sky showing far overhead . Jimmerson peered into the dimly lit recess before stepping over the high curb and into the sheltered twilight . The courtyard was utterly silent , the walls blocking even the traffic noise on the street . He walked hesitantly along the wall , trailing his right hand , and watching to see if there was anyone about . He felt as if he were trespassing , and he was ready to apologize and get the hell out if he were challenged at all . But the courtyard was empty , the brick pavers up in weeds as if no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , shuttered windows with an iron balcony looked down from the second story ; the lower story was nothing but weathered brick , uninterrupted except for a single deeply set door with a heavy brass knocker and a tiny peephole . Jimmerson stood looking for a moment at the door . Gladstone had described it to him , and , seeing it now , he felt as if he were at the edge of something , as if something were pending , as if opening it would change things irreversibly and forever . A gust of wind blew into the courtyard , kicking up a little wind devil of leaves and trash and dust , and Jimmerson ducked into the doorway recess , out of the turmoil . He put his hand on the door knocker , but the door was apparently unlatched , and it immediately slammed open , propelled by the wind . Jimmerson slipped inside , pressing the door shut behind him , and stood for a moment in the quiet darkness , letting his eyes adjust . He heard sounds now , the shuffling of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crow , and he stepped carefully along down the hallway toward what was clearly the back door of a shop that fronted on the Plaza , the door 's wavy glass window dimly lighted from the other side . Hesitantly , he rapped on the glass , ready to convince himself that there was nobody there , that Gladstone was a lunatic . The floating corpse might as easily have been a clever balloon . And Mrs. Crandle was so stupefyingly obscure that ... He heard a voice from beyond the door , and he knocked again , harder this time . " Come in , " someone said , and Jimmerson turned the knob and pushed the door open , looking past it at the interior of a cluttered curiosity shop . He nearly tripped over an elephant's-foot umbrella stand that held a dozen dusty umbrellas , some of them so old and shopworn that their fabric was like dusty lace . There were thousands of books stacked on open shelves , tilting against the walls , piled in glass-fronted cases alongside crystal wineglasses and flasks and decanters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inscribed on the front , and fishbowls full of marbles , and no end of salt and pepper shakers  --  grinning moon men and comical dogs and ceramic renditions of characters out of ancient comic strips . The skeleton of a bird hung from the ceiling , and beneath it stood propped-open trunks full of doilies and tablecloths and old manuscripts . A painting of an ape and another of a clipper ship reclined against a long wooden counter scattered with boxes of old silverware and candlesticks and hinges and dismantled chandeliers . The silver seemed to shimmer where it lay , and there appeared above it a brief crackling of flame , like a witch fire , that died out again with a whoosh of exhalation . He noticed a crow on a high perch , staring down at him , its head tilted sideways . The crow hopped along the perch , clicking its beak , and then said , " Come in , " three times in succession . Beyond the crow 's perch , back past the clutter of collectibles and curiosities , lay more rooms full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other pieces of electrical gadgetry , old clothes and musical instruments and coffee mugs and articles of wooden furniture , most of it apparently thrift store junk . Back in the shadows something rose slowly into the air and then descended again , and there was the brief sound of moaning from somewhere deep in the shop , and another gleam of witch fire that ran along the tops of the books leaving a ghostly trail behind it that drifted lazily to the ceiling . There was a movement behind the counter , and Jimmerson saw that a man sat back there on a tall stool . He was a small man with compressed features , possibly a dwarf , and he read a heavy book , his brow furrowed with concentration , as if he were unaware that Jimmerson had come into the shop . A sign on the counter read , " Merchandise taken in pawn . Any items left over thirty days sold for expenses . " Another sign read , " All items a penny . No refunds . " Jimmerson looked around again , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collectibles , some of them clearly valuable antiques . A suit of armor in the corner appeared to be ancient - a museum piece - and there was a glass case of jewelry that sparkled like fireflies even in the dim shop light . The all-items-a-penny sign must be some sort of obscure , lowball joke . " Selling or buying ? " the dwarf asked him suddenly , and Jimmerson realized that he had put the book down and leaned forward on his stool . There was a lamp on the counter , a great brass fish that illuminated half his face . The other half remained in shadow , giving him a slightly sinister appearance . " Lucius Pillbody , " the dwarf said , extending his hand . " Doyle Jimmerson , " Jimmerson told him . " I guess I 'm really just ... curious . " " People who are just curious ca n't find me , " Pillbody said . " So do n't be coy . Either you 've got something to sell to me or else you 're looking to buy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of questions , if I could . My wife died recently . Her name was Edna Jimmerson . " " That Jimmerson ! Of course . Wonderful woman . Very good customer . " " She bought a good deal , then ? " He could easily imagine Edna buying almost any of this stuff , taking it home by the bagful-although he had n't seen any evidence of it in the house aside from the odds and ends on the bedside table . " I ca n't recall that she bought anything , " Pillbody said . " But then that 's hardly surprising . Why would she ? " " Well ... A penny ? Why would n't she ? " " Because , Mr. Jimmerson , like most of our customers she was interested in lightening ship , throwing the ballast overboard , you know , unencumbering herself . " " I guess I do n't know . I 've been away . " " I mean to say that she pawned a goodly number of her own possessions . " He waved his hand , gesturing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows how much of this was hers . I do n't keep books , Mr. Jimmerson . I used to separate things out a bit-Mr . Jones on the east wall and Mr. Smith on the west wall , figuratively speaking , which worked well enough if Smith and Jones were willing to let go of a great deal of merchandise . But what about Mr. so-and-so , who came in with a single item and never returned ? " Jimmerson shook his head helplessly . " Well , I could tag it , of course , and arrange it on a shelf , alphabetically , say . But there were a hundred Mr. so-and-sos and I was always losing track . Tags would fall off . I 'd have a busy week and have to find a second shelf to handle the overstock . In thirty days , of course , the merchandise would come off that shelf and find its way onto yet another shelf . And nobody ever claims their pawn , Mr. Jimmerson . In all my years in the business only a couple of resolute customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Possessions , Mr. Jimmerson , are a great weight to most people , and I 'm afraid that your wife was no exception , if you 'll pardon my saying so . " Jimmerson nodded blankly . Apparently he knew far less about Edna than he thought he did . He had never really paid attention , never tried to see the world the way she saw it . He had always been too caught up in his own point of view , in his own way of seeing things . Even with this damned Frenchman . Edna obviously found something in the man that she could n't find in Doyle Jimmerson . What was it ? Jimmerson had never asked , never even thought about it . " Anyway , now there 's no order to things , " Pillbody said . " Smith and Jones are scattered far and wide . I made some effort - when was it ? midcentury , I guess - to order things according to type , but to tell you the truth , that did n't work out very well either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you call it ? Off color , perhaps . Obscene is nearer the mark . I 'm talking about the product , let 's say , of a particularly disturbed mind , of the human id at its darker levels : your murderer , your pervert . You 'd be astonished at what you 'd find in here , Mr. Jimmerson . Objective tokens of murder and rape . Illicit sex . The sort of trash that you or I would repress , you know , hide away from the light . Does that astonish you ? " " I do n't know , " Jimmerson said . " I guess I am astonished . " " All of it went into the room back in the southeast corner , what I used to call the parlor room . Full to overflowing , I can assure you . Now and then a customer would come in , feigning interest in books or jewelry or what have you , but by and by he 'd disappear into the parlor room , and I knew what sort of thing he was really after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one man , a Mr. Ricketts , who frequented the parlor room . One of my best customers , if you want to define the word purely in terms of copper coins , which none of us do . Mint ? " " Pardon me ? " Jimmerson asked . He was utterly baffled now . Murder ? Perversion in the parlor room ? No wonder this place was hidden away . The man held out a small bowl of white mints . Jimmerson shook his head , and the man shrugged . " Looks just like depression glass , does n't it ? " He tilted the bowl , allowing Jimmerson to get a better look at it . It was pink , and had a sort of repeating pineapple pattern on it . There was something not quite symmetrical about the bowl , though , as if it had gotten hot and partly collapsed of its own weight , and it had a heavy seam down the center of it , as if it had broken and been welded back together . In each of the pineapples there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry , its eyes half shut . The face looked remarkably familiar to Jimmerson . The bowl too , for that matter , although he could n't for the life of him place it . The dwarf set it down carefully . " What finally happened , " Pillbody said , " was that the parlor room began to stink . Even now you 've noticed a certain smell on the air . " He squinted seriously , as if Jimmerson might dispute this somehow , but Jimmerson nodded in agreement . He had gotten a whiff of it now and then , an undefinable smell of rot . " It was almost poetic . Artistic you might say . The smell would draw this man Ricketts the way rotten meat draws flies , not to put too fine a point on it . Well , I simply could n't stand it any longer . I have to work here . If I had my way , I 'd throw all of it out , straight into the bin . But then of course I do n't have my way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fell upon the idea of scattering the stuff throughout the store , an item here , another item there , and when they were n't any longer in close proximity , they stank a good deal less , although it took years for them to really settle down . Meanwhile I moved - how shall I put it ? a more pleasant selection of merchandise into the parlor room . Much of what we receive here is not altogether unpleasant , after all , at least to you or I. The problem was essentially solved , aside from the telltale remnants surfacing here and there . Too much order , I said to myself , and you start to breed problems . Things start to stink . Unfortunately , one can still detect the odor back there in the parlor room , especially on a rainy day , when the air is heavy . It 's like spilled perfume that 's soaked into the floorboards . And of course I still get the same sort of customer nosing his way back there , although Mr. Ricketts has been dead these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might add . " Jimmerson nodded blankly , then picked up the candy dish again and looked hard at the pattern in the glass , at the unpleasant repeated face .... It was his own face . He was suddenly certain of it , and the realization nearly throttled him . He looked in surprise at Pillbody , who merely shrugged . " As you 've no doubt realized , that was one of your wife 's items , Mr. Jimmerson . " " Can I buy it ? " He hardly knew what he meant by asking . If it had belonged to Edna , though , he wanted it , no matter what it cost . No matter how strange and inexplicable . " I 'm afraid that raises a fairly delicate question , Mr. Jimmerson . " " What question ? If I know the answer ... " He gestured helplessly . " Has Mrs. Jimmerson ... passed on ? " " Last week . " " Then the bowl 's for sale . Let me find something else to put the mints in . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like a tin basin . " I got this from a barber 's wife , " he said . " Take a look . " He held the basin up so that Jimmerson looked into the bottom side , which was highly polished , almost a mirror . Instead of his own reflection Jimmerson saw a man with a beard looking back out at him , his throat cut from ear to ear , blood running down into the white cloth tied around his neck . He recoiled from the sight of it , and Pillbody set it down on the counter . " Does n't affect the flavor of the mints at all , " he said , and he dumped the candy out of Edna 's bowl and into the basin . " That 'll be a penny . " He held out his hand . " Just a penny ? " " Just one . Everything 's a penny . But I 'll warn you . If you try to return it , you 'll pay considerably more to get rid of it than you paid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question , unthinkable . " " I do n't want to return it , " Jimmerson said , and he dug in his pocket for a penny . The dwarf took the coin from him and set it on the counter . Jimmerson looked around then , suddenly certain that he could find more of Edna 's things , and straightaway he saw a familiar pair of salt and pepper shakers  --  ceramic tornadoes , one of them grinning and the other looking like the day of judgment . " Were these ... ? " Jimmerson started to ask . " Those too . Only two weeks ago . " This was uncanny . Jimmerson had the same shakers in his box in the back of the Merc . Except his were smaller , he was sure of it now , and the faces not so clearly defined . One of these had the unmistakable appearance of Edna 's dead Aunt Betsy , and the ceramic platform that they stood on was divided by a piece of picket fence that recalled the rickety fence around the Kansas farm where Edna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such fence . " You 're certain these were hers ? " Jimmerson asked . " Absolutely . " " I do n't recall that she owned any such thing . We bought a similar pair years ago , in the Midwest , but they 're different from these . They 're in my car , in fact , parked out front . " He waved his hand , but realized that he no longer had any idea where " out front " was . His shoulders ached terribly , and he felt as if he had been carrying a heavy pack on his back for hours . His ears were plugged , too , and he wiggled his jaw to clear them . " These were very recent acquisitions , " Pillbody said . " Mrs. jimmerson brought them to me along with the candy bowl . It 's not surprising that you were unaware of them . " Jimmerson fished out another penny . " All right , then . I 'll take these , too , " he said . Pillbody shook his head . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't understand . " " One thing at a time , sir . You 'll overload your circuitry otherwise . You 'd need heavy gauge wiring . Good clean copper . The best insulation . " " Circuitry ? Insulation ? By God then I guess I 'll take the whole shebang , " Jimmerson said , suddenly getting angry . What a lot of tomfoolery ! He gestured at the counter , at the books in the wall behind it , taking it all in with a wave of his hand . He pulled his wallet out of his back pocket and found a twenty-dollar bill . " Start with the jewelry , " he said , slapping the money down , " and then we 'll move on to this collection of salt shakers . We 'll need boxes , because I 've got more money where this came from . I 'll clean this place out , Mr. Pillbody , if that 's what it takes to get Edna 's merchandise back , and if my money 's no good here , then we 'll take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bureau this very afternoon . " Pillbody stared at him . " Let me show you a little something , " he said quietly , echoing Gladstone 's words , and he reached down and pulled aside a curtain in the front of the counter . Inside , on a preposterously heavy iron stand , sat what appeared to be a garden elf or a manlike gargoyle , perhaps carved out of stone . Its face had a desperate , constricted look to it , and it squatted on its hams , its head on its knees and its hands pressed against the platform it sat on . " Go ahead and pick it up , " Pillbody said . " That 's right . Get a grip on it . " Baffled , Jimmerson bent over , put his hands on the statue , and tried to lift it , but the thing was immovable , apparently epoxied to the platform on which it sat . Seen up close , its face was stunningly lifelike , although its features were pinched and distorted as if by some vast gravity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What the hell is it ? " he asked . " What 's going on here ? " " It 's mighty heavy , is n't it ? " " This is some kind of trick , " Jimmerson said . " Oh , it 's no trick , " Pillbody said . " It 's a dead man . He 's so shatteringly compressed that I guarantee you that a floor jack would n't lift him . A crane might do the trick , if you could get one in through the door . " " I do n't understand , " Jimmerson said , all the anger gone now . He was sure somehow that Pillbody was n't lying , any more than Gladstone had been lying about the floating corpse . " Does this have something to do with Edna , with the dwindling that Mr. Gladstone mentioned ? " " The dwindling ? " Pillbody said . " After a fashion I suppose it does . This was a gentleman who quite simply spent too much money . I do n't have any idea what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like yourself , to purchase several hundred dollars " worth of merchandise all at once . He was , how shall I put it ? A parlor room client , perhaps . In my own defense , I 'll say that I had never had any experience along those lines , and I quite innocently agreed to sell it to him . This was the result . " He gestured at the garden elf . " How ? " Jimmerson said . " I do n't ... " Pillbody shrugged theatrically . " I did n't either . The man was simply crushed beneath the weight of it , piled on top of him suddenly like that . Surely you can feel it , Mr. Jimmerson , the terrible pressure in this shop ? " " Yes , " Jimmerson said . His very bones seemed to grind together within him now , and he looked around for some place to sit down . He thought he heard the floorboards groaning , the very foundation creaking , and there was the sound of things settling roundabout him : the crinkle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brakes , a grainy sound like sand being shoveled into a sack , the witch fires leaping and dying ... " It 's like the sea bottom , " Pillbody whispered . " The desperate pressures of the human soul , as heavy and as poisonous as mercury when they 're decocted . Our gentleman was simply crushed . " He shook his head sadly . " I ca n't tell you how much work it was to get him up onto the iron plinth here . We had to reinforce the floor . Here , let me get you a chair , Mr. Jimmerson . " He dragged a rickety folding chair from behind the counter now and levered it open , then drew the drape across the front of the thing in the counter cubbyhole . Jimmerson sat down gratefully , but immediately there was the sound of wooden joints snapping , and the seat of the chair broke loose from the legs and back , and Jimmerson slammed down onto the wooden floor where he sat in a heap among the broken chair parts , trying to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the candy dish , Mr. Jimmerson . Tomorrow 's another day . Tomorrow 's always another day . " Jimmerson climbed heavily to his feet , steadying himself against the counter . He took the dish and nodded his thanks , and Pillbody picked his penny up off the counter and dropped it into a slot cut into the back of the fish lamp . Jimmerson plodded heavily toward the door . He had the curious feeling that he was falling , that he was so monstrously heavy he was plummeting straight through the center of the Earth and would shoot feet first out the far side . He reached unsteadily for the doorknob , yanked the door open , and stepped into the dim hallway , where , as if from a tremendous distance , he heard the dull metallic clang of the penny finally hitting the bottom of the brass fish . There was the sound of an avalanche of tumbling coins , and then silence when the door banged shut behind him . He felt the wind in his face now , the corridor stretching away in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrow , its vanishing point visible in the murky distance . Moss-hung trees rushed along on either side of him , and he knew he was on the road again , recognized the southern Louisiana landscape , the road south of New Orleans where he and Edna had found a farmhouse bed and breakfast . The memory flooded in upon him , and he gripped the candy dish , pressing it against his chest as the old Pontiac bounced along the rutted road , past chickens and low-lying swampland , weathered hovels and weedy truck patches . Edna sat silently beside him , gazing out the window . Neither of them had spoken for a half an hour . She had bought the candy dish from an antique store along the highway - late yesterday afternoon ? It seemed like a lifetime ago . It seemed as if everything he could remember had happened to him late yesterday afternoon , his entire past rolling up behind the Pontiac like a snail shell . The memory of their argument - his argument - was abruptly clear in his mind . He heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he had called her a junkaholic , and talked about how she should n't spend so much of their money on worthless trash . He saw the two of them in that little wooden room with the sloped ceiling , the four-poster bed : how after giving her a piece of his mind , he had knocked the candy dish onto the floor and broken it in two . She had accused him of knocking it off on purpose , which of course he said he had n't , and he had gotten sore , and told her to haul the rest of the junk she 'd bought out of its bags and boxes - the ceramics and glassware , the thimbles and postcards and knickknacks - and he 'd cheerfully fling the whole pile of it into the duck pond . He shut his eyes , listening to the tires hum on the highway . Had he knocked the dish onto the floor on purpose ? Certainly he had n't meant to break it , to hurt Edna . It was just that .... Damn it , he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His years-old anger looked nutty to him now . What damned difference did it make that Edna wanted a pink glass candy dish ? He wished to God he had bought her a truckload of them . His cherished anger had been a bottomless well , but now that she was gone , now that the whole issue of candy dishes was a thing of the irretrievable past , he could n't summon any anger at all . It was simply empty , that well . He glanced out the car window at a half dozen white egrets that stood stilt-legged in a marsh , and he reached across the seat and tried to pat her leg , but he could n't reach her . She sat too far away from him now . He accelerated , pushing the car over a low rise , the sun glaring so brightly on the highway ahead that he turned his face away . He held the dish out to her , but she ignored him , watching the landscape through the window , and the sorrow that hovered in the air around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upholstery smell of their old pink and gray Pontiac . The car had burned oil - a quart every few days - but they had driven it through forty-two states , put a lot of highway behind them , a lot of miles . " Take it , " he whispered . But even as he spoke it seemed to him that she was fading , slipping away from him . There was the smell of hot oil burning on the exhaust manifold , and the sun was far too bright through the windshield , and the tires hummed like a swarm of bees , and the candy dish slipped out of his hand and fell into two pieces on the gray fabric of the car seat . When he came to himself he was outside again , standing in the wind , the door that led to the curiosity shop closed behind him . He searched the paving stones for the broken candy dish , but it was simply gone , vanished . He tried the door , but it was locked now . He banged the door knocker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang through the courtyard , echoing from the high brick walls . THE CAFE DES LAUMES lay two blocks west of the Plaza , near the old train station . It shared a wall with Tubbs Cordage Company , and across the street lay a vacant lot strewn with broken concrete from a long-ago demolished building . In the rainy evening gloom the cafe looked tawdry and cheerless despite the lights glowing inside . There was no sign hanging outside , just an address in brass numbers and a menu taped into the window . He watched the caf6 door from the Mercury , not quite knowing what he wanted , what he was going to do . He opened the glove box and looked again at the .38 that lay inside , and then he gazed for a moment through the windshield , his mind adrift , the rain falling softly on the lamplit street . He shut the glove box and climbed tiredly out of the car , walking across the street and around the side of the building , its windows nearly hidden by overgrown bushes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , the nearest headlights three blocks away on the boulevard . He ducked in among the bushes , high-stepping through a tangle of ivy and parting the branches of an elephant ear so that he could see past the edge of the window . The cafe was nearly empty - just an old man tiredly eating a cutlet at a corner table and two girls with bobbed hair huddled deep in conversation over a tureen of mussels . Jimmerson saw then that there was a third table occupied , a private booth near the kitchen door . It was des Laumes himself , his curled hair brushed back , a bottle of wine on the table in front of him . His plate was heaped high with immense snails , and he probed in one of them with a long-tined fork , dragging out a piece of yellow snail meat and thrusting it into his mouth , wiping dripped sauce away with a napkin . His chin whiskers worked back and forth as he chewed , and the sight of it made Jimmerson instantly furious . He thought of going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the glove box , and giving the sorry bastard a taste of a different sort of slug .... But then he recalled the broken candy dish , and somehow the anger vanished like a penny down a storm drain , and when he searched his mind for it , he could n't find it . To hell with des Laumes . He hunched out of the bushes again and walked up the sidewalk to where an alley led along behind the cafe . The building was deeper than it had appeared to be , a warren of rooms that ran back behind the cordage company . It was an old building , too-hard to say how old , turn of the century , probably , perhaps an old wooden flophouse that had been converted to a cafe . There were a couple of windows aglow some distance along the wall , and beyond them a door with a little piece of roof over it . Jimmerson tried the door , but it was locked , bolted from the inside . He spotted a pile of wooden pallets farther up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pallets off the pile and dragging it along the asphalt until he stood beneath the window . He tilted it gingerly against the wall and climbed up the rungs until he could see in over the sill . A high-ceilinged room lay beyond the window , a table in the comer , a row of beds along one long wall , a big iron safe near the door , some packing crates and excelsior piled in a heap on the floor . The beds rose one atop the other like bunks in an opium den . Each of the beds had a small shelf built at the foot end , with a tiny wineglass hanging upside down in a slot , and a small decanter of greenish liquid , possibly wine , standing on the shelf . Three of the beds were hidden by curtains , and Jimmerson wondered if there were sleepers behind them , like dope fiends on the nod . He heard a rhythmic sighing on the air of the alley around him - what sounded like heavy , regular breathing , a somnolent , lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man entered the room now ; it was the old cutlet eater from inside the cafe . He moved haltingly , as if he were half asleep , and without a pause to so much as take off his shoes , he climbed into one of the bunks and pulled the curtain closed . Another of the curtains moved , pushing out away from the bed hidden behind it , and as Jimmerson watched , a man in a wrinkled suit and stubble beard rolled out from beneath the curtain and balanced precariously on the side rail of the bunk , apparently still asleep . Jimmerson braced himself , expecting him to tumble off onto the floor , but instead he tilted slowly back and forth , as if buoyed up by whatever strange currents circulated in the room . He muttered something inaudible , and the muttering dissolved into a muffled sob . And then he tilted forward again so that he seemed to cling to the bed with a knee and an elbow . There was the sudden crash of something hitting the wooden floorboards directly beneath him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Gladstone 's dead man . But there was a tether tied to his ankle , the other end of the tether affixed to an iron ring bolted to the bed frame , and the man leveled off and floated peacefully just below the ceiling . The object on the floor was clearly a teddy bear , or at least the replica of a teddy bear , and from where Jimmerson stood it appeared to have been contrived with uncanny verisimilitude  --  apparently out of rusty cast iron . It looked wom from years of handling , its nose pushed aside , one of its eyes missing , a clump of stuffing like steel wool shoving out of a tear in its leg . Along the wall opposite stood an open cabinet divided into junk  --  filled cubbyholes , much of it reminiscent of the stuff in Pillbody 's shop bric-a-brac mostly , travel souvenirs and keepsakes . Jimmerson made out what appeared to be an old letterman 's sweater , a smoking pipe , a carved seashell , a tiny abacus , a copper Jell-o mold in the shape of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nude woman , her face downcast , her hands crossed demurely in front of her . He saw then that there were name placards on each of the cubbyholes , hung on cup hooks as if for easy removal . He stepped backward off his makeshift ladder , his hands trembling , and started back down the alley toward the street , although he knew straightaway that he was n't going anywhere . Gladstone had warned him about this , so it was n't any vast surprise . He had largely come to understand it , too - what Pillbody 's curiosities amounted to , what it was that Edna had sold , why she had grown more and more vacant as the months had slipped past . He thought about the odds and ends on her bedside table , the medicinal-smelling bottle with the green stain , the liqueur glass , and he wondered if one of these narrow beds had been hers , a sort of home away from home . Retracing his steps to the pallet , he climbed back up to the lighted window and forced himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right away , the third cubbyhole from the left . He could see that there was something inside , pushed back into the shadows where it was nearly hidden from view , something that caught the light . He strained to make it out - a perfume bottle ? A glass figurine ? He searched his memory , but could n't find such an object anywhere . The door opened at the far end of the room now , and an old woman walked in , followed by des Laumes . Her hair was a corona of white around her head , and she was wrinkled enough to be a hundred years old . The floating man had descended halfway to the floor , as if he were slowly losing buoyancy , and the old woman grabbed his shoe and a handful of his coat and steered him toward his bed again , pushing him past his curtain so that he was once again hidden from view . She bent over to pick up the thing on the floor , but des Laumes had to help her with it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into a cubbyhole marked " Peterson . " She turned and left then , without a word . Des Laumes remained behind , looking around himself as if suspicious that something was out of order . He appeared to be sniffing the air , and he held a hand up , extending his first finger as if gauging the direction of the wind . Jimmerson moved to the corner of the window , hiding himself from view . A moment later he peered carefully past the window casing again . The Frenchman held the statue of the woman in his hand now , scrutinizing it carefully . Then he peeked inside one of the cubbyholes and retrieved a glass paperweight that appeared to Jimmerson to be packed with hundreds of tiny glass flowers . Des Laumes held it to the light , nodded heavily , and walked across to the safe , spinning the dial . He swung the door open , placed the statue and the paperweight inside , and shut the door . Jimmerson climbed down again and set off up the alley . His thinking had narrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Within a few seconds he had the .38 out of the glove compartment . He slipped the gun into his trousers pocket , then walked straight across the street , up the flagstone path to the cafe . The door opened and the two girls with the bobbed hair came out , arguing heatedly now , neither one of them looking happy . Jimmerson slipped past them through the open door , face to face with des Laumes himself , who stood there playing the host now . The Frenchman reached for a menu , gestured , and moved off toward a table before realizing who Jimmerson was . He turned around halfway across the empty cafe , a look of theatrical surprise on his face . " What a pleasure , " he said . " Can I have a word with you somewhere private ? " Jimmerson spoke to him in the tone of an old and indebted friend . " It 's very private here , " the man said to him . " How can I help you ? " His face was bloated and veined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he reeked of cologne , which only half hid a ghastly odor reminiscent of the stink in Pillbody 's " parlor room . " " Help me ? " Jimmerson asked , hauling the gun out of his pocket and pointing at the Frenchman 's chest . " Better to help yourself . I 'll follow you into the back . " He gestured with the gun . " I 've been shot before , " des Laumes told him , shrugging with indifference , and jimmerson pulled the trigger , aiming high , blowing the hell out of a brass wall sconce with a glass shade . The sound of the gun was crashingly loud , and startled horror passed across des Laumes 's face as he threw his hands up . Someone peered out of the kitchen - the chef apparently - and Jimmerson waved the pistol at him . " Get the hell out of here , " he shouted , and the man ducked back into the kitchen . There was the sound of a woman 's voice then , and running feet . A door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's go , " jimmerson said , aiming the gun with both hands at the Frenchman 's stomach now . The man turned and headed back through the cafe , past the kitchen door , down a hallway and into the room with the beds . Keeping the pistol aimed at des Laumes , Jimmerson reached into Edna 's cubbyhole and pulled out the trinket inside - a glass replica of what appeared to be the old Pontiac . He hesitated for a moment before slipping it into his pocket , steeling himself for the disorienting shift into the past , into the realm of Edna 's memory . Probably he would lose des Laumes in the process . The Frenchman would simply take the pistol away from him , maybe shoot him right then and there .... But nothing happened . He might as well have dropped his car keys into his pocket . " The safe , " Jimmerson said . Des Laumes shrugged again . " What is it that you want ? " he asked , turning his palms up . " Surely ... " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimmerson told him . " I do n't know what you are- some kind of damn vampire I guess . But I do n't have one damn thing to lose by blowing the living hell out of you right now . You should know that , you ... stinking overblown bearded twit . " He stepped forward , closing in with the pistol as if he would shove it up the Frenchman 's nose . The man fell back a step , putting up his hands again and shaking his head . " Now open the safe , " Jimmerson told him . The Frenchman spun the dial and opened the safe door , then stepped aside and waved at it as if he were introducing a circus act . " Clean it out , " Jimmerson told him . " Put everything into the boxes . " He picked up a packing crate and set it on the floor in front of the safe , and des Laumes took objects out one by one and laid them in , packing the excelsior around them . " This is common theft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's right , " Jimmerson told him . " And it 'll be a common hole in the head for the good Pierre if he does n't hurry the hell up . That 's it , monsieur , the statue , too . Now the stuff in the cabinet . Fill those boxes . " He thought about the chef , the rest of them that had fled through the back door . Would they go to the police ? He made up his mind right there on the spot : if he heard sirens , if the door flew open and des Laumes was saved , Jimmerson would shoot the man dead before he handed over the gun . Des Laumes filled a second packing crate and then a third , until every last piece of bric-a-brac lay in the crates . Except for the glass automobile , Jimmerson had n't recognized any of it as Edna 's . And even if des Laumes knew the source of the things in the safe , he would n't tell Jimmerson the truth about them . The man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him but his idiotic beard like a runover tar brush . Jimmerson was heartily sick of the sight of it , and with the .38 he motioned des Laumes against the wall , away from the sleeping people on the beds . He easily pictured killing the man , shooting the hell out of him , leaving him dead and bloody on the ground . But somehow the taste of it was like dust in his mouth . How would there be any satisfaction in it ? He could as easily picture Gladstone shaking his head sadly , and the idea filled him with shame . More trouble , more pain - anger like a drug , like alcohol , like lunacy , having its way with him again . There were no sirens yet , no need to hurry . " Sit down , " he said , and des Laumes , his face white now , slumped obediently against the wall . Holding the gun on him , Jimmerson removed one of the liqueur-filled decanters from its niche in the shelf above an empty bed . " Drink it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to him , and he held the pistol against the man 's ear . De Laumes stared at him , as if he were making up his mind . He shook his head feebly and started to speak . And then , as if suddenly changing his mind , he heaved a long sigh , shrugged , and drank off the contents of the decanter . " That 's it , " Jimmerson said . " Down the hatch . " He fetched out another decanter , and forced him to drink that one , too , and then a third and a fourth . All in all there must have been two quarts of the stuff , and the room reeked with the camphor and weeds smell of it . Des Laumes 's face had rapidly taken on a green pallor , and he looked around himself now , a growing bewilderment and horror in his eyes . He clutched his expanding stomach and slowly began to rock forward and backward , his head bouncing with increasing force off the wall behind , his eyes jerking upward in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . Jimmerson backed away in case the man got sick , watching as the rocking intensified and des Laumes began to jackknife at the waist like a mad contortionist , his forehead driving impossibly against the floorboards , a piglike grunting issuing from somewhere deep inside him . Jimmerson awakened the four sleepers , two women and two men the old cutlet eater and poor Peterson . The women , both of whom still clutched their handbags , were surprisingly young and bedraggled , and they looked out from their beds , blinking their eyes , growing slowly aware of des Laumes 's thrashing on the floor . One by one Jimmerson helped them down , untethering them from the beds , unbolting the back door and letting them out into the alley . Mr. Peterson walked like a man on the moon , high-stepping through the puddle , and it occurred to Jimmerson to offer him back his cast-iron teddy bear for ballast , but he saw that it would n't be a kindness to him . Soon enough he 'd be heavy again . When the four of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crates out into the night and then headed around the cafe to where the Mercury was parked . He climbed inside , fired it up , and swung around the corner into the alley , letting the engine idle while he loaded the crates into the rear of the car along with his own boxes of junk . There was a noise from inside the cafe like rocks hitting the walls , and Jimmerson looked in through the door , which was partly blocked by des Laumes himself . The Frenchman had levitated a couple of feet off the floor , and his body spasmed in midair like a pupating insect in a cocoon . The room roundabout him was strewn with unidentifiable junk - rusty iron and dirty glass and earthy ceramic objects , misshapen and stinking . Jimmerson pulled the door shut and climbed into the Mercury , slamming the car door against the sounds of knocking and grunting and moaning , and backed away down the alley , swinging out into the street and accelerating toward home as the rain began to fall again . He reached into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he set carefully on the top of the dashboard so that it caught the rainy glow of passing headlights , and it was then that it dawned on him that he should have left des Laumes a penny . He had needed every cubic inch of the big rental truck in order to clean out Pillbody 's shop . The dwarf had made him sign a release , and had talked obscurely about Jimmerson 's " aim being true . " " On the up and up , " he had said . " Solid copper wiring . No imperfections . " But he had taken the thousands of pennies happily enough , although he had refused to drop them into the brass fish until Jimmerson had packed up what he wanted and driven away . Jimmerson had wanted it all , and Pillbody had worked alongside him , running wheelbarrows full of curiosities out the back and across the courtyard to where Jimmerson had backed the truck up to the circular brick doorway of the courtyard . The truck crept east along Maple Street now , the engine laboring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rims , the truck bed heaving ominously from side to side . Jimmerson sat hunched in the driver 's seat , which sagged beneath his weight , and he fought to see the road in front of him as bits and pieces of arcane and exotic imagery stuttered through his mind like subliminal messages , almost too rapidly to comprehend . His skin twitched and jerked with competing emotions : dark fears rising into euphoric happiness , dropping away again into canyons of sadness , soaring to heights of lunatic glee . Somewhere in the depths of his mind he heard the clatter of pennies cascading and was dimly aware of the howling of the truck engine and the smell of hot oil and burning rubber . There was the sound of a hose bursting , and a wild cloud of steam poured out from under the hood , and in the swirling vapors a startling array of faces appeared and disappeared . Edna 's face came and went , and he recognized the face of the bearded man with the bloody neck , and felt a stab of vicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eye , and then one face was replaced by another and another and another , a dozen at a time , a hundred - a tide of shifting visages soaking away into the sands of his ponderous and overloaded memory . Now and then he came to himself , heard the truck creaking and groaning , saw that he had made his way some few feet farther up the road , felt the seat springs burrowing against his thighs , the cramping of muscles , the pressure on his bones and his teeth . His breath rasped in and out of his lungs and his head pounded and the truck engine steamed and roared . Edna 's face appeared before him time and again now , and he was swept with her memories - the memory of a fire in a hearth on a rainy night , the two of them in easy chairs , an atmosphere of utter contentment that he squirreled away in his mind , holding fast to it , and yet at the same time crippled by the thought that she had given this memory away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden to her as sorrow .... He saw that he was nearly at Oak Street , nearly home , and he cranked the steering wheel around to the right , felt the weight of the load shift ponderously , the truck tilting up onto two wheels . For a moment he thought he was going over , and in that impossibly long moment the pennies continued to fall into Pillbody 's brass fish , and the faces whirled in the steam in wild profusion , and Jimmerson felt himself crushed like a lump of coal by a vast , earth-heavy pressure . HE OPENED his eyes when he felt the sun on his face next morning . He lay slumped on the seat in the cab of the truck , and he moved his arms and legs gingerly , testing for breaks and strains His laws ached . and his joints felt stiff and sore , as if he were recovering from a flu . He sat up and looked out the window . Somehow he had made it home , alive , although he had only the vaguest recollection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain beating on the roof off and on through the night . He opened the door and stepped down onto the street , seeing that he had driven the passenger side of the truck right up over the curb , and the wheels were sunk now in the wet lawn . Most of the paint was gone from the truck body , apparently shivered off , and the tires were flayed to pieces . The truck bed was nearly emptied , scattered with just a few odds and ends of bric-a-brac . Late yesterday evening Pillbody had finally given up counting pennies and purchases , but even so they must have come awfully close to square in the transaction if this was all that had been left unpaid for . Jimmerson climbed heavily up onto the bed and filled a crate with the leftovers , then climbed down again and hauled it into the garage where he had taken des Laumes 's three crates yesterday morning . He set about methodically smashing each object to fragments with a sledgehammer , making sure that none of them could ever be sold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the most work , but finally it too crumbled into a hundred chunky little fragments that Jimmerson dumped into a pickle jar and capped off . And now , with Pillbody 's stuff either consumed or broken , and des Laumes 's cafe cleaned out , the whole lot of it was once again a memory , a thing of the past . He went inside where he showered and shaved and changed into fresh clothes , and then he hauled the single bed outside and threw it onto the back of the truck , replacing it in the bedroom once again with the double bed from out by the garage . Edna 's remembrances - the paperweight , the postcard , the silver spoon , and the glass Pontiac - he put into the curio cabinet in the living room . He would never know what they meant , and their presence in the house would remind him of that . He opened the windows finally , to let the air in , and then went out through the front door , climbed into the Mercury , and drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer a mystery . The old storefront , with its dusty litter , its confusing mirrors , and its nailed-shut door had been swept clean , and he could see through the window into the rear of the shop now , clear back into Pillbody 's parlor room where workmen were rolling fresh paint onto the walls . He got back into the Mercury and headed west . The Caf6 des Laumes had collapsed on itself , the windows shattered , the walls fallen in , the roof settled over the wreck like a tilted hat . Jimmerson wondered if des Laumes himself was in there , under the rubble , whether the man had simply imploded in the end . To hell with him . It did n't matter anymore . He swung a U-turn , rested his arm along the top of the seat , and drove back south toward the cemetery , where he would try once again to pray .
