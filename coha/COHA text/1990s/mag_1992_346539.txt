EXHIBIT : " GUERCINO " <P> WHERE : THE DRAWING CENTER , NEW YORK CITY <P> WHAT : 60 DRAWINGS FROM THE ROYAL COLLECTION IN WINDSOR CASTLE <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : These superb , spontaneous works show a 17th century master at his best . <P> Giovanni Francesco Barbieri ( 1591-1666 ) was known from childhood and , since his death , to art history as Guercino  --  " the Squinter . " Thus he joins Masaccio ( " Tom the Lump " ) and Sodoma among the notable Italian painters who survive in pejorative nicknames . One flinches to think what this practice might have done to the self-esteem of artists in the late 20th century had it gone on . <P> The beautiful show of Guercino drawings on loan from the Royal Collection in Windsor Castle that opened this month at the Drawing Center in New York City reminds you , moreover , how labile reputation can be . Guercino was one of those 17th century Italian artists who sank under the weight of an earlier age 's revival .

Consequently , Guercino , like a number of his contemporaries  --  Guido Reni and the Carraccis , for instance , or even Caravaggio  --  was slighted . The first Guercino exhibition was not held until three centuries after his death , in his ! birthplace in central Italy , the small Emilian city of Cento , in 1967 . His rediscovery was due almost entirely to the love and labors of one English art historian , the late Denis Mahon , who wrote the basic texts on him , defined the canon of his work and was probably the last connoisseur to " own " single- handedly a major European artist in this way . <P> Guercino worked in an age when , although the mechanisms of fame were becoming more centralized , it was still possible to sustain a life 's work on a provincial reputation .

There he painted one enormous canvas , the Burial and Reception into Heaven of Saint Petronilla , for an altar in Saint Peter 's , but the Pope died in 1623 , and back to Cento the painter went . Later he moved to nearby Bologna . Guercino had a steady stream of commissions from local churches in Emilia , but from Rome 's point of view he was overshadowed by other Bolognese virtuosi who worked in the metropolis : the Carraccis and especially Reni . <P> And in fact , Guercino did not have Reni 's breathtaking skill as a painter . But he was not afflicted by Reni 's sentimentality either , and where he shone , as this compact and rewarding show makes clear , was in the act of drawing . By comparison with his preparatory drawings , Guercino 's final paintings are quite often labored and stodgy .
