" <p> McGruder said Collins made the statement in an interview with States News Service of Washington , which provided the Free Press with a tape and a correct transcript . <p> Collins had issued a statement in July saying she was falsely quoted .

The real problem with press coverage , she said , is not media favoritism , but the tendency to cover " conflict over content " and " process over product . " <p> Russert and Mashek discounted the findings of a Freedom Forum survey last year that showed 89 percent of Washington journalists voted for Clinton - a study Alexander and several in the audience referred to as proof of media bias .

" <p> A content analysis of 105 hours of Limbaugh 's show suggested that mainstream reports falsely lead people to believe talk radio is routinely uncivil and possibly dangerous by " focusing on extreme moments . " <p> It suggested the influence of political talk radio has been overstated . <p> " By focusing on moments in which talk radio may have mobilized citizens or influenced legislation , but not on those in which it failed to do so , articles on talk radio may exaggerate its impact , " the study said . <p> " The studies that have been done up to this point have been single-shot surveys , so they 've only been able to get a look at the talk radio listenership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamieson , dean of the Annenberg School .
