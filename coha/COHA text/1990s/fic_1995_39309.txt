1 came into that house of sickness when the Great War was over , as a girl of seventeen . They were there waiting for me , father and daughter , like a pair of birds , with their long noses and their great black eyes . The girl was a slip of a thing , no more than twelve , but she spoke up for the father in a loud , deep voice . " Can you do this , Agnes ! " " Have you ever done that ! " And the old man sat in his armchair with his watch chain and his penny glasses , his pipe in his mouth and the little black mustache . Sometimes he said something to the girl in their own language , and then she would start up again , " Agnes , do you know how to  --  " <p> The wife was dying in the front parlor . They had moved a bed in there for her , and they kept the curtains drawn . In the lamplight , she looked a bit like a Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nostrils , cheekbones . Even the hair was parted in the middle and pulled back into a plait . <p> From the start , she could n't stand the sight of me . She would ring her little bell and then , if I came in , give out one of her coughs , drawing the lips back from the raw gums to spit . And if that did n't do the trick , she growled and clawed her hands . So I had to call the native girl to go in and put her on the pot or whatever it was she wanted this time . I did n't mind . I had n't come all this way to empty potties . They 'd hired me as a housekeeper , and if the old woman was going to claw and spit every time I entered the room , well , soon she would be dead and I 'd still be a housekeeper . <p> They gave me a little room on the third floor , very hot in the hot season , but it had a basin in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , I would watch the races from the window , the natives swarming in through their entrance , and then the Europeans in their hats , with their cars and drivers waiting . After a while , I even knew which horse was coming in , although I could only see the far stretch . But I never went down myself , even though Saturday was my day off , and I never laid a bet . <p> I kept my money in a purse around my neck , day and night . I did n't trust the natives , and I did n't trust the old man I worked for . Every week , he counted out the shillings into my palm , and one before the last he would always look up into my face with a smile to see if I knew he had stopped too soon . The daughter of the house told me it was a little game he played . But I never saw him play it on the natives . There were two of them , male and female , and they lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job was to tell them what to do and to see they did n't mix up dishes for fish and dishes for meat , which they did all the time regardless . <p> It was the daughter who had recited the rules of the kitchen for me , delivering the whole palaver in that voice of hers , oh Lord ! And once , when there was butter left on the table and the meat was being carved , it was she who called me in and held out the butter dish as if it had bitten her on the nose . And the old man , with his serviette tucked into his collar , set down the carving knife and put a hand on her arm . So she shut up . <p> There were other children too , but they were grown-up and married . Some of the grandchildren were older than this girl , older than me too . One of the grandsons fancied me . He was about my age , taller than the rest , and he had blue eyes and a lovely smile . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give pleasure to a Jewboy , even a charmer . I meant to make a marriage of my own , with a house and a servant too . <p> Then , one day , the old man sent up a mirror for my room , and I stood it across one corner . It was tall and oval and fixed to a frame so that I could change the angle of it by a screw on either side . For the first time ever I could look at myself all at once , and there I was , tall and beautiful , and there I took to standing on a Saturday afternoon , naked in the heat , shameless before myself and the Lord . <p> Perhaps the old man knew . When I came into the room now , he would look up from his newspaper and smile at me if the daughter was n't there . And , under his gaze , it was as if we were switched around , he and I , and he were the mirror somehow , and I were him , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arms and the legs , the breasts and the thighs , the hair between them . And in this way I became a hopeless wanton through the old man 's eyes , in love with myself and the look of myself . I could n't help it . I smiled back . <p> And then , one Saturday afternoon , he knocked at my door and I opened it , and in he came as . if we had it all arranged , and he went straight over to the mirror and looked at me through it . I looked , too , a head taller than he was , bigger in bone , and not one bit ashamed to be naked . <p> The first thing he did was to examine the purse around my neck , which I always wore , even in front of the mirror . He fingered it and smiled , and looked up into my face . I thought he might try to open it and start up one of his games , but he did n't . He left it where it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to my breasts , and put his face into the middle of them . And then he took them one at a time and used his lips and his tongue and the edge of his teeth , and all this silently except for the jangle of my purse and the roar of the races outside . Somehow he unbuttoned himself and had his clothes off and folded on the chair without ever letting me go . And we were in and out of the mirror until he edged me to the bed , and there we were , in the heat , under the sloping ceiling , the old man and me , me and me , and I never once thought of saying I was n't that sort of girl . And when he had gone and I found a pound note on the table , I did n't think so then either . Money was what there was between us . I was hired as a housekeeper . And he had given me my mirror . <p> She found out about it , of course , the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , whining and weeping . But he did n't say much . And when the daughter came to find me in the kitchen parlor and announced in that voice of hers that I was never to go into her mother 's room again , who did she think she was punishing ? <p> Still , I felt sorry for the girl , ugly little thing , still flat in the chest , with the thin arms and the yellow skin and a little mustache on the upper lip . I would have told her how to bleach it , but she would n't look at me now . Nor would she look at her father . She sat at the table with her eyes fiercely on the food , saying nothing at all . It was only to her mother that she would speak willingly , rushing into the front parlor when she came home from school , performing her recitations there , as if the old woman could understand a word of them . <p> For me , the house was separated in another way  --  up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before me in silence ; and down here the dark sickness , the smells of their food and the sounds of their language , the natives mooching around underfoot . <p> And meanwhile , my money mounted up . The old man kept to the habit of leaving some for me every time . Not always a pound but never less than 2,6 . After a while , there was far too much to fit into the purse , so I hid the notes in a place I had found between the mirror and its wooden backing , hid the larger coins inside the stuffing of my pillow . One Wednesday , when I had the afternoon off , I took it out of the hiding places and went down to the Building Society and put it in there . But still I wore my purse around my neck , and he loved to notice it there , and to smile as he began to unbutton . <p> His teeth were brown from the pipe , with jagged edges to them , and his legs and arms were thin and yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I did n't have to ask myself what it was about his oldness and his ugliness that I waited for so impatiently at my mirror . The younger men , the beautiful young men I saw at the races or on my way through the racecourse into town , or even the sons and the grandsons of the household , who were always looking at me now but not in the same playful way  --  they would bend me to themselves , these young men , require a certain sort of looking back and laughing into the future . Oh no . <p> In the evenings , I brought the old man his sherry on a tray . He drank a lot for a Jew  --  two or three sherries , and wine too , when he felt like it . And then once he looked up at me as I put down the tray , and there I was in that moment wondering how I could bear to wait until Saturday , and somehow he knew this because that night he came up the back stairs after the daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was even better , the curves and the colors , my foot in his hand , pink in the candlelight as he put it to his cheek and then held it there as he slid his other hand along the inside of the thigh . And I have never felt so strongly the power of being alive . <p> And then one Saturday afternoon , I was at the mirror waiting , and the door opened and it was the daughter to say they had called in the doctor , her mother was dying . Except that she did n't get it out because of the sight of me there , naked , with my purse around my neck . And I just smiled at her , because this was my room and she had no business coming in without knocking , and also I liked the look on her face as she gazed at me . And then , as I sauntered to the wardrobe for something to cover myself with , she said , " I knocked , but you did n't hear , " and she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , that I turned and I saw that she was crying , the eyes wide open and staring while the tears found a course around the nose and into the mouth . And she looked so frail , gaping there like a little bird , and she would be so lost now that the cursing old bitch was actually dying , that I went to her , naked as I was , and put my arms around her , and she did n't jump back but buried her face between my breasts as her father did and held me around the waist , snorted and wept against me for a while . <p> " The races are on , " I said , to calm her down , and " Shall I dress and come downstairs ! " But she just held on tighter , and I saw that she was looking at us in the mirror , and there we were , a strange pair hugged together when he arrived in the doorway behind us , and , even so , we did n't turn but stood there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said something to her in their language and she sort of melted on the spot , folded down onto the floor in front of me , her hands around my ankles , weeping again . And of course I knew it had happened , the old woman was dead , and that it would change everything , had changed things already . There he stood in my mirror , a tired and ugly old man , muttering something to his youngest daughter . She would take over now , this strange bird at my feet . It was the way it would be , that I knew . And I must get dressed and find my way in the world . <p>
