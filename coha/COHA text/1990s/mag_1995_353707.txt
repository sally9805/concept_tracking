As he awaits indictment  --  possibly by the end of this week  --  and a trial that could send him to his death , Timothy McVeigh leads a cramped and isolated life . The suspected bomber of the Oklahoma City federal building rises at 6:30 a.m. in his 8-ft. by 12-ft. cell in the Federal Correctional Institute in El Reno , Oklahoma , showers , dons an orange jump suit . Then , as he told TIME in answers to written questions , he has nothing to do but read ( newspapers , a biography of Patrick Henry ) and slam a racquetball against the wall . <P> McVeigh can not watch TV , though it watches him . He is under camera surveillance 20 hours a day . He can not even see anyone from his cell except the armed guard who sits right outside  --  one of three who keep a constant vigil . Would-be visitors are discouraged ; even McVeigh 's lawyer , Stephen Jones , has to go through three layers of security to see his client . McVeigh leaves his cell rarely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a windowless , bulletproof van to the Oklahoma City federal courthouse . From its windows , grand jurors , and perhaps eventually trial jurors , can clearly see the ruins of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building that McVeigh is suspected of having bombed on April 19 , killing 168 people . <P> It is anything but the life foreshadowed by 95 pages of McVeigh 's academic records from the Starpoint Central School District in Lockport , New York , near the Canadian border . According to the documents Jones released to TIME , McVeigh was a bright ( IQ 128 , above average ) , hardworking student who got sloppy at times but earned mostly A 's and B 's through high school , falling just outside the top 20% of his class , which disqualified him for the training he wanted as a computer programmer . More striking are the descriptions of a likable youngster limned year after year in the handwritten evaluations of his teachers . Wrote a Mrs. Lane , who taught the fifth grade , for example : " Tim has been a pleasant , cooperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active , contributing participant in all group activities  --  a real asset to this class . I 'll miss him ! " <P> How did he turn into the gun-obsessed loner and right-wing drifter described in most reports of his activities between his time in Army service and the Oklahoma bombing ? Even if his trial explores that subject , it is a long way off . In a preview of his strategy , lawyer Jones makes it clear he will dispute the government on every point  --  and take his time doing it . " The bottom line of our defense , " he says , " is this : we will concede nothing . " <P> The grand jury is working against a deadline of this Friday for handing up an indictment . Jones says matter-of-factly that he hears it will actually come Thursday . But he plans to ask permission to present to the grand jury exculpatory evidence that he claims he and six assistants have dug up in their own investigation . He will also ask the grand jury to call more witnesses  --  but not McVeigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deadline for indictment  --  for how long is uncertain .
