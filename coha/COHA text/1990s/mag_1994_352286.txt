After his Friday press conference , President Clinton sat in the Oval Office with TIME Washington bureau chief Dan Goodgame and White House correspondent Michael Duffy for an exclusive interview . Clinton talked about his learning process on foreign policy , his philosophy of military force and his recollections of a bully who pushed him too far . <P> TIME : You 've had a string of successes overseas lately . Has anything about your handling of foreign policy changed ? <P> Clinton : First of all , it 's a more disciplined , tightly focused process now than it was in the first year . The weekly meetings with the national-security team , which we have now even when some of the principals are gone , enable us to take a long view . We 've also allocated slightly more time every day for the national-security briefing , and it 's amazing what a difference  --  it 's another 15 minutes to 30 minutes over and above the base-line time we normally give it . <P> TIME : What does that total now ? <P> Clinton : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I think I 've learned about this is that explaining to the American people what our interests , our values and our policies are requires a more systematic and regular explaining . In a time when the overall framework is not clear and when people are bombarded by information , I think a President has to do that with greater frequency and to try to make a continuing effort not only to shape a new world but to find ways to explain that world to the American people . And I do n't think I did that as well as I should have in my first year . Even when I was doing the right things , I 'm not sure I communicated it as clearly as I should have . I think I 'm doing a better job of that now . <P> TIME : You 're not talking as much on the fly either . <P> Clinton : I 've completely stopped that . I think that is a mistake . Then the third thing I would say is that even if your larger strategy is right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very persistent , just working at it means that you learn things and you make fewer tactical mistakes . <P> I think my objectives and my strategy have been right . The best thing we 've done is to stick with it . A lot of these things , really , we 've been working on for a long time . But I think , tactically , we are making better moves . We 're doing it better ; we 're making fewer mistakes . Part of that is , I think , just learning . <P> TIME : You were quoted in the first year as saying you did n't want to spend much time on foreign matters . Do you feel more confident than you were before ? <P> Clinton : Yes . I think the more you work at any job , and the more you succeed and the more you learn from the things that do n't work , the more your confidence rises . So there 's no question about that .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
