<p> What 's happening to the great chefs of San Francisco ? They 're fleeing to the suburbs . <p> Increasingly those of us who review restaurants are finding we have to drive to dine at some of the best places . In Palo Alto , Jeremiah Tower is opening a Stars and Bruce Cost , who closed Monsoon and fled to Ginger Island in Berkeley , is about to unveil Ginger Club in the Stanford Shopping Center . <p> But these chefs will have to do more than simply put their names over the doors to compete with Donia Bijan , who has opened L'Amie Donia in downtown Palo Alto . <p> A MOB SCENE <p> In only two months , her restaurant has been fully embraced by the locals . On most nights it 's a mob scene , and I 've gladly been a part of it because of the exceptional food . <p> Bijan earned her reputation during the four years that she turned out food as stunning as the surroundings at the Sherman House in San Francisco . After a brief stay at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to new heights , she moved south to work on her new restaurant , located on Bryant Street in downtown Palo Alto . <p> SOULFUL CREATIONS <p> Her soulful creations stick pretty much to the classics , but she adds her own interpretation to most dishes . Bijan 's Coq au Vin ( $ 13.50 ) makes the standard preparation seem like a poor substitute . She marinates the chicken in red wine and cooks it until it nearly falls off the bone in a hearty bacon-laced broth that begs to be used for dunking bread . <p> The dish is completed with halves of new potatoes , whole mushrooms and pearl onions . It is presented in a deep-sided , covered casserole with two lengths of toast peeking out of the top . Unfortunately , because of the presentation , you end up feeling as if you are sneaking bites from a pot rather than sitting down to eat in a civilized manner . <p> Duck ( $ 16.50 ) is cooked two ways : The pink-hued breast slices are fanned over a generous mound of saffron rice , studded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistachio . Then the leg is made into a confit and the meat is removed from the bone and served atop baby greens , surrounded by walnut-size sauteed plum halves . <p> The rabbit ( $ 15 ) is first grilled , smothered in mustard and then popped into the oven to roast before being presented with tiny tomatoes and potatoes , some no bigger than a hazelnut . The rabbit was so meaty that parts were a bit underdone , so we had to maneuver around the bloody parts . <p> For a lighter preparation , Bijan pan- braises sea bass in romaine leaves ( $ 16 ) and presents it on a plate of tender beans , green from pesto , and combined with chunks of tomatoes and calamata olives . <p> Appetizers include a generous skewer of seared chicken livers ( $ 6.95 ) marinated in sherry and served with a puddle of lentils , redolent of bacon and onions . The rich flavors were right on the mark , but we had to send the plate back because the livers were not cooked enough . <p> PERFECT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of year for the salad of cornmeal-breaded fried tomatoes ( $ 7 ) , served with a corn and arugula salad . The tongue salad ( $ 6.75 ) is so tender you could almost spread the thin slices that are arranged around leeks flavored with a mustard-caper vinaigrette . <p> Every night the chef also does a special three-course menu for $ 24 . Recently , it consisted of a salad of duck liver , seared to a crunch , and served on slightly bitter greens . Tiny pea-size Champagne grapes added a burst of sweetness at all the right moments . <p> For the main course , Bijan topped halibut with scales of crusty sauteed potatoes and surrounded the fish with a lemony beurre blanc . Dessert was a standout : a thin , crisp Napoleon with layers of praline and lemon mousse . <p> In all cases , desserts ( all $ 5 ) are as good as what precedes them . Blackberry/peach pie has a perfect crust and a beautiful balance of flavor when paired with the caramel ice cream . <p> Tender buckwheat crepes have just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topped with whipped cream that melts over the plate . Profiteroles , stuffed with a potent Turkish coffee ice cream , are so crisp they could stand in the rain and retain a crunch . <p> With all this great food , it 's fitting that the best element of the interior is the open kitchen , with counter seating in front . You 're so close that you can feel a quick blast of heat when the oven opens . <p> EFFICIENT STAFF <p> My admiration for the food rose markedly when I saw the sous chef , who looked like a Stanford scholar thanks to his round glasses and serious expression . He would bend down to inspect the duck breast as he arranged the slices over the rice , and he took time to individually salt every dish . The efficient , jovial waiter , who seemed to keep up a constant patter with customers and the kitchen staff , gave us a taste of a new wine and talked about the food in such a way that we knew he loved what he was selling . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the best seats in the house , " said the man at the seat next to ours . <p> TABLES SQUEEZED IN <p> He was right ; not all the seats are as prime as the counter . There is only room for 49 people ( 20 more with the front and back patios )  --  and the tables are squeezed in . Some tables are awkwardly placed next to the front door , so you feel as if you are cut off from the main action . Still , the overall impression is bright , thanks to the cheerful walls  --  mustard-colored on top and celadon below  --  separated by cherry-wood molding . The straight-lined , lattice-back chairs help dress up the space . <p> The dining-room staff members have a similar attitude as our waiter at the counter . At times they are overextended and a few mistakes happen  --  not providing the proper utensil when you need it , for example  --  but the staff clearly works as a team , which makes for corrections that are fairly quick and smooth . <p> L'Amie Donia represents the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay Area dining scene of late  --  PlumpJack Cafe and Zax in San Francisco , Rivoli in Berkeley or Willowside in Santa Rosa , for instance . Being a resident of San Francisco , I selfishly wish Bijan would come back here , but her food is worth a special trip . <p> SMALL BUT SOLID WINE LIST <p> With only 37 wines , Donia Bijan is able to produce a French-California wine list that is as solid as the food at L'Amie Donia . The selections , almost half of them available by the glass , are a well-conceived mix of classics and accomplished newer wineries . <p> Choosing from the by-the- glass list might be the best way to proceed . The 1992 Peachy Canyon Zinfandel ( $ 5.25 for a glass ; $ 19 a bottle ) is a great match to the coq au vin and duck with saffron rice . The 1992 Kuentz-Bas Pinot Blanc ( $ 4.50/$ 17 ) would enhance the Normandy-style fish stew with scallops , halibut , fennel and apple in an apple broth ; and the 1993 Babcock Sauvignon Blanc ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the half shell . <p> Bijan has paid special attention to keeping the prices under $ 30 ; only four wines rise above that mark . The best deals are on the California selections , where the markups are rarely more than double . French selections seem to be the higher profit center for the restaurant and are marked up half again . <p> L'AMIE DONIA <p> 530 Bryant Street ( near University ) , Palo Alto <p> ( 415 ) 323-7614 <p> Open for lunch 11:30 a.m. - 2:30 p.m. weekdays .
