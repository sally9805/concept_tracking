<p> Editorial wrongly faulted airlines and pilots for DIA noise <p> I recently read the editorial , " Noise from planes at DIA must be taken seriously , " which appeared in the July 19 Denver Post . <p> As an Adams County resident living 4 1/2 miles north of DIA , a professional airline pilot with 10,000 hours of flight time , and an ardent opponent of the location chosen for DIA , I would like to remind the editorial staff of a few facts that were distorted or ignored in the editorial . <p> The writer 's statement , " There 's no excuse for air traffic at Denver 's new airport to disturb that facility 's distant neighbors with excessive noise , " is incorrect . Everybody knows you ca n't have a major jet port without having major jet noise . <p> The writer mentions the early safety and noise projections , but fails to mention that DIA opponents who challenged the results of those studies , and have recently been proven correct , were shouted down by Gov . Romer , Mayor Pena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else who thought they could sweeten their political careers or make a buck off the new airport . <p> The writer errs again when he/she makes the assertion that airliners " follow shallow sloping sky paths in and out of the runways " to save fuel . I paraphrase Federal Aviation Regulation 91.87 ( d ) ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) : " When approaching to land , the aircraft 's flight path must be maintained at or above the electronic glide slope or Visual Approach Slope Indicator path if the runway of intended landing is so equipped . " <p> This approach angle has nothing to do with fuel conservation and everything to do with flight safety . A steeper approach angle would consume less fuel , but because it is more demanding of the pilot and the airframe , could significantly erode the margin of safety the passengers pay for , and which the FAA mandates . A shallower approach angle would require more power ( because the airplane is descending at a slower rate ) and hence more fuel . <p> The writer is apparently unaware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more fuel at low altitudes . Shallow departures prolong the time at low altitude and therefore increase , not decrease , the amount of fuel used . The writer is correct that ATC controllers hold the key to noise abatement , but not by adjusting approach and departure angles . They can do this by routing Stage II and heavily laden Stage III aircraft laterally away from noise-sensitive areas . <p> When the writer seeks to blame airline management and pilots for the noise problem at DIA , he/she demonstrates a profound ignorance of historical facts regarding the politics of DIA , and how the air traffic system really works . He/she would have been more accurate to suggest that DIA noise is the result of a flawed airport location , which was foisted upon the Denver metro area to satisfy narrow political and economic ambitions , with little or no real consideration given to mitigating the negative impact it would have on surrounding communities . <p> CHARLES R. ELLISTON <p> Brighton <p> Senator 's support of dam project criticized <p> As a lifelong Republican , I resent Sen. Ben Nighthorse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views suspect . This is especially the case with his July 16 plea in The Post for construction of the Animas-La Plata water storage project . <p> Colorado does n't need any more expensive public-works projects added to its tax bill . Animas-La Plata is n't wanted - let 's continue with our government 's trend toward downsizing and leave pork-barrel projects to the past . <p> ROGER J. WENDELL <p> Aurora <p> The vote was to give the Bureau of Reclamation even more money than it was asking for , for a project ( Animas-LaPlata ) with no economic justification , by the bureau 's own admission . As long as the old politics of pork barrel spending are alive and well in the halls of Congress , it will be hard to take seriously the protestations of the new congressional majority that they want to balance the federal budget . <p> CHARLES ORIEZ <p> Littleton <p> It 's not often I chuckle out loud at something I read on the editorial page . But the contradiction of Ben Nighthorse Campbell 's last line in his letter to the editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations , like great people , keep their words of honor . " Does anyone else see the irony in this comment from our Democrat ? /Republican ? senator ? <p> DEBORAH McGLATHERY <p> Arvada <p> Intrepid artists eventually do n't starve <p> Well , I noticed that I did n't receive a MacArthur fellowship this year ; shucks . So I guess this means that I , as a visual artist , will just have to muddle along somehow . I have to admit that I , like many of my colleagues in the visual arts , seem to keep on making and selling the art we make . <p> Many people think artists are always starving in a garret somewhere . This may be true when an artist first starts on the career path , but the ones who are intrepid seem to become successful , although I know that success can be subjective . I think being successful as an artist means there 's food on the table , the studio is warm , the lights are on , once in a while some money comes in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not written anywhere that artists have to starve or suffer ; smart ones do n't . <p> It behooves the art community to let the public know that many of us artists are doing just fine , thank you , but if those persons wish to support us , we 'd be glad for that ; after all , the true artist will persevere with or without support . I am a successful artist who works and lives in Denver , is listed in " Who 's Who in American Art " and does n't need the National Endowment for the Arts . <p> BOB RAGLAND <p> Denver <p> Why not just bomb the Bosnian Muslims ? <p> I have the one solution for the situation in Bosnia I 'm sure the U.N . would find acceptable : bomb the Bosnian Muslims . This would be a far more humane method of achieving the same goal the U.N . and Western powers obviously have in mind - annihilation of the Bosnian Muslims . Can there be any other explanation for their pretense of helplessness and indecision in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if committed by Saddam Hussein , whose countrymen still suffer crippling sanctions for his actions five years ago ? <p> What other explanation is there for NATO 's failure to implement air strikes to protect the so-called " safe havens " as they pledged months ago ? Is there any possible justification for the U.N . ' s refusal to lift the arms embargo , which has prevented Bosnians from their basic human right to defend their homes and families from brutal genocide at the hands of well-armed Serbs ? The U.N. , in direct violation of its own charter , has neither defended the Bosnians , nor allowed them to defend themselves , or - as the Bosnian government has repeatedly requested - agreed to leave Bosnia . <p> There can no longer be any doubt that , despite their endless rhetoric and empty condemnations , the U.N . and the powers whose interests it represents are 100 percent in support of Serbian actions in Bosnia . In light of that , I suggest they bomb the Bosnians quickly out of their misery and horror . <p> AMEENA JANDAYI <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This letter is in response to the two articles published on July 13 and July 14 concerning the tragic drowning of a Boy Scout near the Colorado-Utah border . Neither article stated the number of adults supervising the Scouts , but a family spokesman stated , " Sam had not been under close supervision " when he drowned . <p> Based upon nine years of experience as a trained adult volunteer in the Boy Scouts of America , including five as an assistant Scoutmaster , I would like to offer the observation that it is difficult to recruit parents/adults who will take the training ( usually offered twice a year ) and support the Scoutmaster on monthly weekend campouts . The Boy Scouts of America requires a minimum of two registered adults to be present at any Scout function ; but for many activities more than two are needed to provide the " close supervision " people would like to have . <p> Taking Scouts on a weekend campout is a stressful and complicated logistical undertaking requiring maximum adult involvement , not the minimum . <p> As I reflect upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scouting activities might provide the safety and comfort level we all desire . <p> PETER C. SGIER <p> Englewood <p> Schroeder harping helped <p> in Lowry , Fitzsimons loss <p> The deification of Pat Schroeder by Gil Spencer in his column on Sunday , June 25 , deserves comment . <p> Schroeder hungers for attention and gets it by bullying those who ca n't or wo n't fight back . She certainly has n't gained any recognition as a skilled and effective legislator . <p> To those who think Schroeder 's shrill harping at the military for over 20 years did n't contribute to the loss of Lowry and Fitzsimons - I have a bunny costume and a piece of the Great Wall I 'll sell you real cheap . <p> J.
