HARYSEN CROUCHED amongst the thick mosses and fine-leafed vegetation of the forest floor . The rain dripped around him , drizzling off his graying hair and the mildewed lens of his camera . He 'd lived in this forest for nearly a month now and in that time the rain had never stopped . It cloaked the forest in a misty curtain , like some jealous spirit unwilling to share even a glimpse of its dominion with the world beyond . <p> And worse , several days ago Harysen had felt obliged to abandon his raincoat . The constant drips and drops had rattled so obtrusively against the plastic coat that he 'd stopped wearing it after he 'd spotted the wild children . Now he was always wet . He hunkered close to the ' ground , soaked to the skin and freezing as he awkwardly tried to make his long , husky frame invisible amongst the rain-bejeweled vegetation . <p> Across a fog-shrouded clearing he could see the two children . He 'd observed them often enough to overhear their names : Menoot and Ukra . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had just reached full-flower . They waited , motionless and almost invisible amongst the bright orange blossoms , camouflaged by the cloaks they wore , fine cloaks woven of tens of thousands of feathers all dark green , gray and brown . <p> The children were hunting birds . . . or the things that passed for birds here . Nasty little four-legged , leathered reptiles . Miniature dinosaurs with bad dispositions . Avesaurs was what the park wardens called them . A few of them were capable of gliding , but none could really fly . The feathers were for warmth , or perhaps for courtship . Harysen was n't sure . To him , the children were far more interesting . <p> A sharp squawk recalled his attention . A flock of bright orange birds no bigger than his fist had appeared in the lush green foliage of a neighboring tree . As Harysen watched , the flock of ten or twelve individuals scrambled through the dripping canopy and into the blossoming tree . <p> Instantly , an avesaurian cacophony descended upon the forest . The children had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The little orange avesaurs were trapped in the goo . They squawked and screamed and flapped , their calls resounding off the canopy , the forest floor . <p> The little girl , Ukra , half-stood on her perch amongst the branches . She was probably about eight years old , no more . An ululation arose from her throat , and she skittered through the bobbing tree limbs , chasing the last few holdouts back to the area of sticky branches . One orange avesaur took off in a long glide to a neighboring tree . The others stuck . <p> The boy , Menoot , chirped in a kind of mocking imitation of his frantic prey . The tree branches dipped and swayed as he scuttled to the nearest orange bird . Menoot looked about ten , his long , coppery hair secured in a hundred skinny braids . His feather cloak made no rustle at all as he moved ; it shifted on his back , utterly silent . He tossed one side of it over his shoulder . Underneath he wore brown leather breeches . His feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a pouch that he wore at his waist , then he reached for one of the squawking , panicked birds . Grabbing its beak , he tucked it under its wing . Then he massaged its feet , rubbing a salve on the avesaur 's clawed toes that dissolved the sticky resin and freed the frantic creature . Then Menoot picked it up and thoroughly cleaned its feet . He cradled it for a moment against his chest while his hand flicked rapidly across its back , almost too fast to follow , and then the bird was free , running off across the branches to disappear amongst the foliage . In the boy 's fingers Harysen could just make out a small collection of orange feathers . These went into another pouch at Menoot 's belt and then he moved on to another bird . <p> Only then did Harysen remember to take pictures . The camera lens wandered between the boy and his sister . The camera disk whirled . Then abruptly the image of Ukra and Menoot vanished from the viewfinder , to be replaced by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . <p> Standing in front of him was a short , wiry man , heavily bearded , with blue eyes and a dark complexion . Like the bird-catching boy , this man wore only leather breeches and a long feather cape . But his cape was of striking colors : crescents of electric blue rocking across a brilliant yellow field . And like the boy , his hair was fixed in tiny braids , though his were enlivened with strings of feathers to match the cloak . Harysen had never seen this man before , but knew he must be Menoot 's and Ukra 's father . <p> His gaze raked across Harysen  --  his inferior height and bulk seemed to trouble him not at all  --  and suddenly Harysen felt like a guilty adolescent rather than the self-assured artist who 'd commanded the attention of society for over two decades . The bird catcher spoke : " Why have you come here ? " he demanded . " And why are you harassing my children ? " <p> Harysen felt a rush of surprise . The bird catcher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance . But why ? This man was no more native to Weyken than Harysen himself . He was a renegade , a runaway from the cities , a squatter living here in defiance of Congressional edicts that declared the very presence of human beings on natural worlds to be an illegal pollution . <p> Harysen rested a strong hand on his camera , resisting the instinctive urge to a combative response . " You 've got it wrong , friend , " he said in a low , rugged voice . " I 'm no threat to your family . And I 'd never let on to the park wardens you 're here . I 've come to work , that 's all . I do sculpture  --  carvings in wood and bone . " <p> " And you 're on Weyken with permission , huh ? A special man . " <p> Harysen chuckled , determined to be agreeable . " The government let me come . I wanted to study nature  --  " <p> " And with a whole planet full of nature , why did you make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden surge of guilt . The bird catcher was right , of course . He 'd built his house in this part of the forest because he 'd wanted neighbors . He 'd wanted to be close to the squatters , to watch them , to learn how they lived . Because the only part of nature that had ever really interested him was human nature . But such reasons would seem frivolous to this man . He stiffened , as he glimpsed a flicker of his own mortality in the bird catcher 's eyes . <p> Suddenly , a startled shout sounded from the tree tops . The bird catcher spun around , his gaze fixed on his children . " Red-dragons ! " the little girl cried . In a blur of motion the bird catcher disappeared up the nearest tree , climbing the rough-barked trunk with fingers and toes . <p> Harysen twisted around , his gaze scanning the tree tops . Three scarlet avesaurs were approaching through the canopy . From their nose to their hind legs they were as long as Menoot . Their short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashed as they raced towards the captured flock of orange avesaurs . With their blocky snouts and decorative plumes they looked like miniature Chinese dragons armed with a heron 's stabbing beak . <p> Harysen found himself running awkwardly across the forest floor , stumbling over roots and fallen branches . The children were in the dragons ' path . And they were n't moving . " Get out ! Get away ! " Hawsen shouted in a booming voice . But his warning was eclipsed by a tremendous roar from the tree tops , a predator 's howl of rage . <p> The dragons stopped abruptly . The roar sounded again , and suddenly the red avesaurs switched directions and fled , disappearing within seconds into the dense foliage of the canopy . Harysen turned around , searching the branches for this new danger . But he saw only the bird catcher moving carefully towards his children . <p> Harysen leaned against a tree , his head down as he tried to catch his breath . When he looked up again , Menoot , Ukra , and their father were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully cleaning each member , while exacting as tribute a small wad of orange feathers . Together the family required only a few minutes to finish . Then they cleaned the tree branches and vanished into the canopy . <p> Harysen sat in his living room , in the odd house he 'd ordered built on the brink of a precipitous gully , cradling in his hand a glass of bourbon and water , no ice . He lived without refrigeration or air-conditioning . The entire planet of Weyken was an official wilderness , so the park wardens had decreed that the house must have no central power . The only machinery Harysen had been allowed were a few small shop tools , an electronic notebook and of course , the transit booth . <p> But Harysen counted the limited accommodations as one of Weyken 's attractions . He 'd grown tired of an environment programmed to address his every need ; of an audience that adored everything he made , be it quality or crap . Something in him had longed to escape the absurd safety of society , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to warm his ration packs in a real fire , to breathe air generated by a living forest , to be close to the land and his own instincts  --  this was an experience he 'd sought all his life . <p> He 'd even let himself hope that Weyken would prove a cure for the strength-sucking sense of futility that had haunted him these past few years . Now he laughed at the thought . Weyken had n't changed anything . He was play-acting here , and he knew it . <p> He gazed past the open glass doors to the patio , watching a small brown bird hop across the heavy vine that had climbed up the posts of his house . The vine twined about the covered patio , its heart-shaped leaves a lovely shade of spring green , its flowers like small beads of purple glass . The bird had woven a nest among the branches , and just this morning Harysen had counted three white eggs . <p> He thought about doing some work . His publicist had convinced a Congressional committee that this forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with its magnificent selection of hardwoods . Special legislation had been passed allowing him to come here . Back in the world , expectations were high . <p> " I am the eyes of my age , " he announced to the little bird that hopped about the twining vine , poking its head in and out amongst the leaves as it searched for insects . " My hands have made the art that will define this time in history . " <p> The little brown bird remained wisely unimpressed , as was Harysen himself . He was a sculptor , that was all . And the work he 'd done in the past mostly pleased him . But it was past , leaving always the question what next ? <p> For almost a year , the answer had been nothing . His ex-wife had adopted the habit of chastising him daily . His agent had grown surly . The hoity-toity art crowd had begun to bid up the prices on his work in a slow-boiling round of speculation . <p> And then he 'd read about Weyken . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd found himself with permission to go on an ' artist 's retreat ' on the uninhabited world  --  to become the only alien creature in a biological preserve that encompassed the entire planet . <p> Only later did he discover the squatters . His research turned up at least six groups in widely scattered locations throughout the southern cloud forest . The wardens seemed unaware of their presence . Harysen did nothing to enlighten them . But he did change the location of his house , because suddenly he was far more fascinated by the biological potential of his own species than by that of the entire ecosphere of a nearly unknown world . <p> LOOKING PAST the patio doors , Harysen toasted the antics of the small bird , then tossed back the last of the watered bourbon . It glissaded down his throat , leaving a trail of warmth that never quite seemed to reach his blood anymore . Shoving his chair back with a loud scrape , he stood , intending to put a few more pellets on the fire . <p> His eye caught a flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw the bird catcher stepping out from the vegetation beyond the patio , his bright blue and yellow cape glistening in the misty light . <p> " Well , well , " Harysen muttered to himself , his surprise quickly evolving into caution as the bird catcher crossed the patio and entered the house . <p> The man was a head shorter than Harysen , but his sinewy shoulders left open the question of who held the advantage in strength : He fixed Harysen with a severe gaze . " Why have you been spying on my children ? " <p> Harysen scowled . He really was n't good at diplomacy . Still , he was determined to try . " The same reason they 've been watching me , I expect . Simple curiosity . You know , they sometimes leave gifts of green wood for me on the forest floor where I 'm sure to find them . " <p> And in return Harysen had carved the kids a few toys  --  tiny avesaurs and spoons and abstract ornaments . He left the trinkets in the forest because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've taken pictures of my children , " the bird catcher accused . He started moving about the rustic living room . <p> Harysen watched him suspiciously . " The pictures are harmless , " he said . " They 're for my personal use ; I wo n't publish them . And the wardens will never see them . " <p> The bird catcher had found Harysen 's electronic notebook . He picked it up , examined it for a moment , then strode with it from the living room into the hallway . <p> " Hey , wait a minute ! " Harysen started after him . Oval windows looked out into the forest on either side of the passage . Then the hall opened up into the studio . On the workbench was a large battery-powered saw , lying amidst all the hand tools Harysen used in his work . The bird catcher 's glance skipped over the saw before fixing on the dark , depthless door of the transit booth . <p> Then he was up the stairs , two at a time . Harysen abandoned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he roared , bounding after the man . " And this is my house . What are you after , anyway ? " Harysen reached the top of the stairs and turned into the bedroom . A window-wall looked out over the gully and the gently falling rain . <p> The bird catcher stood silhouetted against the wall , his cape tossed back over his bare shoulders . " Where are the pictures ? " he demanded . <p> Harysen nodded grimly . " All right . I 'll concede the picture-taking was out of line . An invasion of your privacy . " He walked to the cabinet and opened the door . The camera was on the shelf . He pulled the disk out of it , and turned that over to the bird catcher . " Destroy it if you like . " <p> The bird catcher took the disk , slipped it into a pouch at his waist , then held out his hand . " And the rest of them ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " I 'll take the rest of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on the safe side . " <p> Harysen bridled . " I wo n't give you my camera . I need it for my work . " He crossed his muscular arms over his chest . <p> With reptilian speed , the bird catcher stepped past Harysen , seized the camera from the cabinet shelf , then turned and flung it straight at the panel of rain-streaked glass . It struck the pane and shattered , while the glass resounded with a metallic wail . " The rest of the disks , " the man said again . " I 'll take them now . " <p> Harysen studied the ruined camera . Then he looked back at the squatter and nodded slowly . He 'd come here to learn , not to fight . " I 'll get them for you . " <p> The disks had fluttered like silver fish as they tumbled down , down the deep ravine , finally disappearing into a fog bank far below . The electric saw and notebook had followed , and then the small kit of power tools . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked again . Harysen scowled , feeling himself a hypocrite in the other man 's eyes . <p> " Weyken is a living world . Listen to its rhythm , and you 'll know your tech does n't belong here . " <p> " Nothing of us belongs here , " Harysen growled . " We 're all trespassers . " <p> The bird catcher looked at him as if he were a rather unappetizing morsel . " Who decided that ? " Then the man turned swiftly about and started down the path . " I will move my family , " he called back over his shoulder . " And you will have an artist 's perfect isolation . " <p> Harysen sat up late into the night , bourbon in hand , staring out the open living room door to the vine-wrapped patio while the rain tapped and slid through the twining leaves . Now and then he heard a roar far off in the forest . Occasionally he heard a rustling in the brush nearby , and then he would stiffen , alert for danger . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his gloomy thoughts . <p> He must have nodded off eventually , because when he awoke , gray dawn was seeping through the clouds . He heard the crack of a stick , a soft giggle , the tapping of the rain . He sat up abruptly , the sounds echoing strangely in his memory , and he was suddenly unsure if he 'd heard them at all , or if it had been the last remnant of a dream . He listened , his ears straining past the patter of the rain , his eyes searching the leafy face of the forest beyond his patio . <p> The giggle had belonged to the boy . He was almost sure of it . He stood slowly and walked to the open doorway . " Menoot ? " he called gruffly . " Ukra ? Are you there ? " The children were like the birds they hunted - up at dawn and nowhere to be seen after sunset . He took a step farther . " There 's no need to be afraid , Menoot . I 'm your friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and after fifteen minutes of patient waiting and calling he gave up , still uncertain if anyone had been near at all . <p> He was walking back across the stone-laid patio when his gaze was caught by three small white eggs on the ground . He bent and scooped them up , recognizing them as the eggs of the little brown bird nesting in the vine . <p> The shells were empty . Each one had been neatly pierced and sucked dry . He hissed in sudden anger . Had the children done this ? Or some other creature ? He started to fling them into the forest . But at the last moment he noticed the nest was n't empty . There were still three eggs in it . But they were different  --  slightly smaller and light pink instead of white . The little brown avesaur was perched on the roof , staring at him anxiously . He tossed the white shells away and walked back into the house . By the time he had the fire up and breakfast heating , the foolish brown bird had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had been so long since he 'd done any real work . And for most of a year that had n't bothered him . But this morning he felt restless , and intensely bored . He went to his studio . The yawning door of the transit booth seemed vaguely threatening , so he turned his back to it , studying instead the shelf that held stumps and chunks of fallen trees that he 'd gathered in the forest . <p> It was so damp here , it was hard to find a piece of wood that was fallen but not rotted . But he 'd gotten a few chunks , the largest no bigger than his head . And the children had brought a few more . Someday soon he 'd cut some green wood and haul it back to the studio to dry . Someday soon . <p> He ran his finger over the scavenged wood . The pieces ranged in color from blond to coppery red . He chose a honey-colored piece and took it to the workbench , then set himself on a stool and studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its own nature . He smiled to himself as shapes began to move in a slow swirl through his mind . The wood was playing with him , giving him only glimpses of its soul . He could n't see the final product yet , but he could see how to get there , so he took up a little hand saw and began to cut . A few grains of sawdust speckled the bench . <p> Something creaked behind him . A soft footstep on the floor . He jumped . The saw snapped out of his hand and clattered to the ground . <p> He whirled around to see a synthetic warden emerging from the depthless gray door of the transit booth . He glimpsed it for only a moment : a faceless , man-shaped figure of white ivory less than a meter high , still wet from the reproductive gel . Then its surface camouflage kicked in . Its skin mimicked the gray of the transit booth , the white of the walls , the green of the forest beyond the windows . . . an undefined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hallway . <p> Harysen suddenly remembered himself . " Stop right there ! " he shouted after the retreating synth . " Where are you going ? What business do you have here ? I 've requested no assistance . Come back here ! " But the synthetic warden ignored him . It probably housed only a partial persona , just enough intelligence to execute its task . <p> Harysen abandoned his work to run after it , driven by a sudden , nasty fear . " Hey you ! " he roared , following the synth out of the house . " Stop right now or I 'll break you in two . " But even as his words echoed across the ravine , the camouflaged synth vanished into the greenery of the forest . <p> Goddamn , if it 's come for them . . . . Goddamn if it 's found them . . . . I wo n't let it . . . . I ca n't let it . . . . Harysen 's breath wheezed in and out past his throat in great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest . He was n't used to moving at this pace . He kept tripping over rotten stumps or slipping on patches of mud and with every step he fell farther and farther behind . Finally , he stopped . <p> All he could hear was the ragged heaving of his own lungs . So he held his breath a moment . His heart boomed in his ears . Distant birds called . Rain pattered on leaves . <p> It occurred to him he had no idea where he was . Slowly he surveyed the ground around him , but footprints disappeared almost instantly in the spongy humus . He raised a trembling hand to wipe at the sweat and rain on his forehead . He told himself there could be many reasons why the synthetic warden had come . He told himself it was not his fault . He told himself lies . <p> If only he could warn the bird catcher 's family . Surely with a few minutes warning they could disappear into the forest ? The synth was stupid . It carried only a partial persona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a few minutes warning . . . . <p> Harysen let his head fall back and he yelled . He screamed . He howled until his throat was raw . " Menoot ! Ukra ! Run away ! A warden is here ! Save yourselves ! Run , run , run ! " <p> Finally , he gave up . The rain was falling harder now . He was soaked to the skin and starting to shake , not necessarily from the cold . He tried to collect himself . Down slope , he thought , recalling the topo map he 'd explored with such pleasure when he 'd been planning his stay on Weyken . The bird catchers live down the slope from me . <p> He carefully examined the forest around him and after a few seconds decided that there was a discernable slope . He started trotting slowly down hill , casting about for some kind of sign and after a while he found what might have been a footpath , though whether it had been made by human feet or by the scaled toes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it anyway and eventually it brought him to a neatly constructed tree house mounted in the lower limbs of two forest giants . The house was made of thatch , and there was an abstract feather ornament of red and blue hung near the door . He thought he smelled wood smoke on the air , but the scent was coy in the rain . <p> " Hello ? " he called tentatively . There was no answer . He climbed a ladder and looked inside the door . Embers glowed in the ash bed of a stone hearth . A slumped figure lay on the floor . Harysen hurried over to it , and crouched down . <p> It was the remains of a woman . The synth had used a bio-accelerator spray on her . Her body was crumbling into a sweet-smelling waxy brown heap that would be indistinguishable from soil in another few hours . <p> Harysen stood slowly and glanced through the rest of the house . There was little to see . Some sleeping pallets , Baskets of nuts hung near the fire where the heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rafters . A half-completed green feather cloak stretched on a rack . A bright blue and yellow cloak thrown casually on the floor . . . the same cloak the bird catcher had worn . He stooped to pick it up , and discovered beneath it another rapidly decaying form . <p> He sank to the ground . His face pressed against the soft feathers of the cloak while his body shook in bouts of rage and grief . <p> It might have been near noon when thunder rumbled in the skies and the rain pushed itself to a new level of intensity . Harysen left then , taking the cloak with him . He climbed slowly down the ladder , keeping his gaze carefully raised so he would n't glimpse the bodies of Menoot and Ukra . Let the forest take them . They belonged to the forest . <p> He wandered aimlessly for a while , having no idea how to get home . He started imagining his own body as a decaying heap on the forest floor and he was honest enough to see the justice in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So he kept going . <p> Around mid-afternoon he was pushing tiredly through a head-high stand of some purple-flowering shrub when he almost stumbled into the deep abyss of the gully . He backpedaled in panic , staring at the misty depths of the cleft while his heart thudded in surprise . But after a moment , he realized he was no longer lost . If he followed the gulch upslope , he 'd eventually come to his house . And so he did , late in the wet afternoon . <p> HE 'D LEFT the patio doors open . As he entered the house he thought he saw a shadow pass swiftly up the hallway , but he heard nothing and when he checked through the house it was empty . He threw the blue and yellow cloak across his bed and thought sourly about the possibility of an avesaur lurking in a closet or behind a curtain . He went downstairs to close the patio doors . <p> But as he touched the handle he heard an odd hissing and a tiny moaning sound  --  a soft , high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of his neck rise . His first impulse was to slam the doors tight and lock them . But it was such a tiny sound . . . . <p> He stepped out onto the patio , into the gray light of late afternoon . The air was dank and the rain was drip-drip-dripping down on his already saturated clothes . The hiss and moan sounded again , and with a wash of relief he realized what it was . He approached the nest of the unassuming avesaur that had been cuckolded by another bird , and peered in . <p> The adopted eggs had hatched . There were three chicks in the nest and their beauty took his breath away . They were tiny , perfectly formed creatures much like Earthly cats but with long , sinuous necks , their bodies covered with iridescent feathers of green and blue . They hissed and moaned , while he smiled in delight . <p> Carefully , he picked one up , cradling it in his hands . It struggled to escape . He tried to calm it . He whispered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung its long neck around and sank its sharp beak deep into the thick flesh below his thumb . He yelped and dropped it quickly back into the nest while the rain washed a large droplet of blood from his hand . Silently , he berated himself . It was an avesaur . A savage , foul-natured bird . Not a source of comfort . Not a human thing . <p> He walked back into the house , stripped off all his clothes and left them in a heap by the patio doors , which he closed firmly . Then he found his packet of bourbon , went upstairs , crawled into bed and wept until the drink ferried him slowly into sleep . <p> When he awoke it was deep dark . The rain was pounding on the window of his bedroom , rattling menacingly against the glass . And over the sound of the rain he heard other noises downstairs . Voices ? Just on the edge of hearing . <p> He strained to catch the words , but the harder he listened , the fainter the sound grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come here . If he 'd stayed away , the park wardens never would have noticed the squatters . <p> But he 'd come , intent on observing the squatters ' lives . . . as if those lives were a performance that he could admire or revile . Now the players had vanished , their existence shattered by the simple fact of his presence . His simple presence . <p> It seemed very cold this night . He reached out to pull a blanket around his bare skin . <p> But his hand encountered feathers . He yanked his hand back in shock , expecting a sharp beak to snap at his fingers . The voices had faded . Only the sound of the rain was left . He reached out again , tentatively this time , and laid his hand on the leathered cloak . He pulled it slowly up to his chin . It slid across the bed without making a sound . <p> But as he closed his eyes , a resounding blow hit the roof of the house . Boom/Right over his head . He ducked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole structure of the house shook with the impact . He waited for a second blow , but a minute passed and there was nothing but the fluid grumble of a rogue wind in the gully . <p> Outside the window , the darkness was easing . He could make out shapes and silhouettes , the familiar outlines of the landscape beyond the glass . <p> With a mental effort he put away his fears  --  did n't dispose of them !  --  just put them away for the moment . He dressed , then wrapped himself in the feather cloak , feeling oddly grand and foolish . Then he went outside to investigate the damage to his roof . <p> A tree branch had fallen on the house . He laughed when he saw it , chiding himself for his night terrors . It was n't even a large branch , though it was heavy . The broken end shone white in the gray morning light with the brilliance of fresh bone . Where had it come from ? He tipped his head back , noting the forest giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a white tear in the trunk of a slender tree that towered nearly a hundred feet over his head . <p> A gift , he thought . This is a gift from the forest . And he felt stricken , as an old , almost forgotten sensation slid into his arms , his fingers . A restless , murmuring wind in his blood demanding that he work . <p> Loathing himself , he bent down to examine the wood , wondering if he dare carve it while it was still green . His soul felt as dark as a rain-filled night . A family had died because of him . But his art was reborn . <p> The wood was the hardest , most beautiful , whitest wood he 'd ever seen . Like ivory , like bone . His blades touched it , scraped it , shaping and sawing across a grain so fine it was almost invisible . And gradually , as the day passed , a composition emerged from the wood . <p> At dusk he sat back to examine it . He was ravenously hungry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he stared at the object , surprised at what he saw . <p> It was a fluid , abstract image of a couple embracing , sharing a passionate kiss that implied a solid union , that promised children . And they were dressed in leathered capes , feathers twined in their hair . It was beautiful . It pleased him as nothing he 'd made before ever had . He studied it in wonder , thinking he would send it back through the transit booth , show his agent , his ex-wife , let them know his career was n't finished yet  --  <p> Feathers shook behind him . Coarse , rattly feathers . Claws scraped on the studio floor . <p> Harysen spun around to see a red dragon crouched in the doorway . It looked huge in that enclosed space , glaring at him with wicked black eyes . It reared up on its hind legs , the long talons of its forepaws rattling against each other with a sound like rain on glass . Then it dove at him . <p> Using its beak as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him with its talons . He screamed and fell back against the wood rack . The dragon bounded after him , its beak stabbing at his eyes . He slapped it away . <p> It came at him again . Its beak struck the back of his hand . Blood spurted from the wound . He howled in rage and kicked at the dragon . It fluttered back a few steps . He looked up , just as a second dragon launched itself at him from the studio window . <p> He raised his hands to shield his face . The avesaur 's body struck him . Its beak stabbed at his throat . He cried out , and whirled away . <p> From the corner of his eye he saw the first bird , stabbing fiercely at his sculpture . Meanwhile , a third individual and a fourth had appeared at the window . Coarse scarlet feathers rustled , rattled . They launched their attack . <p> He ducked to the floor , beating back the flock of dragons with his hands . Blood was running freely from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It hung from the stool where he 'd tossed it when he 'd started carving that morning . <p> Now he grabbed it ; yanked it down on the floor beside him . The unexpected motion seemed to startle the dragons . They backed off for a second . Long enough for him to find his feet . Then he was running . Flashing past the oval windows of the hallway , through the living room , exploding past the patio doors , the cape waving along behind him . <p> At the edge of the forest he paused a moment to glance back over his shoulder . There were at least a dozen more of the red dragons moving in the trees overhead , descending on his house . <p> He spent the night in the forest , surrounded by the utter darkness , by the voices of the night creatures . He huddled under a fern frond , not far from the house , wrapped in the feather cloak . The rain fell against the feathers and rolled away without touching him . The night moved slowly forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> His injuries were superficial , but they still hurt . He was thankful for the cloak . It was a skin that kept him dry and warm through the lightless night . That kept him alive , he thought . He wondered at the art that had gone into making it . How had squatters from the cities learned to make an object at once so beautiful and functional ? Where cons of evolution would have been required to shape a similar adaptation in any other creature , these squatters had done it in less than one generation . And he 'd destroyed them . <p> Are we a form of pollution ? he wondered . The bird catchers had never ravished the forest . Given : a new world and a few humans to occupy it . What would the result be after a thousand generations ? <p> The park wardens insisted any human interference would spoil a world and leave it an environmental hell . But Harysen was n't so sure . Might it be possible to slip into a new world as quietly as a graft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the squatters to pre-judge the outcome ? Was it fair to the forest not to ? <p> Harysen dozed and woke and dozed some more until dawn light finally started to filter through the forest canopy . When there was enough light to see by , he crawled out from under the fern and stood . His legs and back were horribly stiff and he felt light-headed from lack of food . Yet he knew too little about the forest to forage for a meal . If he wanted something to eat , he 'd have to reclaim his house . <p> He stretched and caught a few drops of rain on his tongue and then he set off in the direction of home . It was n't far . He 'd made sure last night that he would n't get lost . So after a minute or two he was standing behind the last screen of vegetation , studying the house . <p> The patio doors hung open . The morning sun probed the interior , illuminating rent sofas and torn rugs . Ashes had been kicked out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dripped in obscene smears on the walls . The destruction appalled him . It had the aspect of a conscious attack against his person , his life . He told himself that was ridiculous . But he had to swallow hard against an ugly knot of superstitious fear . <p> He waited and watched for some twenty minutes but saw no sign of activity , so finally he moved cautiously towards the house . His bare feet squished in the mud , then he stepped out onto the patio . He peered into the house . Broken glass shimmered in the hallway where some of the oval windows had been shattered . A few red feathers were scattered across the floor . But the house seemed silent , empty . <p> A sudden chittering overhead made him jump . He looked up to see the little brown avesaur that lived in the vine . Its head poked down through the leaves as it challenged him , seemingly ready to launch itself at his face . He stepped back in pained surprise . What was going on ? The little creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the nest . Then he turned around to take a closer look . The nest was gone ! Not just empty , but gone . The beautiful baby avesaurs  --  he imagined them being eaten by the red dragons and the thought sickened him . The brown bird raced down the vine , snapping and cursing at him . He retreated into the house . <p> He heard the voices again as he went up the hallway . There could be no doubt this time . He stepped carefully past the broken glass , his heart hammering in his ears . Then he looked in the studio . <p> It was in worse shape than the living room . Everything had been knocked over and destroyed , the windows broken . He saw the sculpture he 'd made yesterday . It was lying upside down in a corner , severely pecked , looking like a disfigured honeycomb . No trace of the original design remained . Fury ran through his brain , but stopped short when he caught sight of the children . <p> They were crouched in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were shiftless , dressed only in brown leather breeches . Their camouflage capes were cast back over their shoulders . The girl , Ukra , had her coppery hair bound up in a huge fluffy pony tail on the top of her head . Menoot still wore his countless tiny Braids . They had the little brown avesaur 's nest on the floor between them . One of the three adopted chicks was missing . <p> Ukra glanced over her shoulder at Harysen . " What is this ? " she asked , indicating the transit booth . " We saw that little hiding man disappear here . Did Morn and Dad go with it ? " <p> Harysen felt his throat knot up . She must have seen the crumbling mounds of organic matter in her home . But why should she recognize those as her mother and father ? <p> Menoot was staring intently at the transit booth 's blank door . He put his hand in ; watched it disappear . Withdrew it and watched it reappear . Then he picked up one of the two remaining hatchlings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Do n't do that ! " Harysen cried , Too late . The boy withdrew his hand , and the chick was gone . <p> " Where did it go ? " he muttered . He reached in and groped around , but his hand emerged empty . He coiled it into a fist and glared at Harysen . " Where 's our Morn and Dad ? " <p> Harysen glanced at the transit booth 's control panel . It was set for the capitol city , probably the warden 's headquarters . He leaned forward , his hand twitching nervously . The children were squatting right in front of the door . With one step he could grab them and fling them through . In a few days they 'd be reconstituted in the city , where the authorities would see to it they were properly cared for . Yes . That was the thing to do . It would be best for them . What hope did they have here ? <p> The little girl watched him with wide eyes , the feathers in her hair moving minutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outcome ? Harysen wondered . <p> He yielded his advantage and squatted on the floor , face-to-face with the kids . They did n't belong in the city any more than the avesaurs . <p> " Your parents are gone , " he said softly . " They ca n't come back . " <p> " They 're dead , are n't they ? " Menoot asked . " My dad told me this might happen . " <p> Harysen nodded gravely . Ukra began to cry . He offered her his arms and she came to him , her decorative feathers tickling his chin , her tears warm against his chest . Her hair smelled of the forest . He breathed in the scent . It filled him ; warmed him ; left him briefly terrified . His arms tightened around her . <p> " We have to go away , " he said hoarsely , astonished at how easily the decision had been made . " Maybe we can find some of the other people who 've settled in this forest . " <p> The boy gazed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come for you too ? " <p> Harysen considered this . " I 'm here with permission . But the wardens will look in on me . If I disappear they might even look for me . . . unless they believe I 'm . . . . " <p> He was thinking about the white wood , and how smooth and hard it felt , so much like bone . " If they found human bones they 'd have to assume I was dead . They might not even bother to confirm whether the bones were real or not . " The boy looked at him with puzzled eyes . <p> " Will you help me learn the forest ? " Harysen asked . Menoot nodded slowly . " And I 'll help you to learn  --  " But what could he offer , really ? Guidance ? History ? Seasoned wisdom ? The opinions of other worlds ? That all seemed of small value here . Maybe it was enough to offer the simple evidence that children grew up into adults . <p> He set the girl on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrieved the remains of his sculpture . He showed it to the kids . " Do you know where I can get more of this white wood ? " <p> Ukra flushed red and ducked her face . Menoot looked stricken . " You want to call the red dragons back ? " he asked . <p> " What ? " <p> " The red dragons always come to the white wood , " Ukra said , looking up . " Mom says when the wood 's cut , it has a smell . The smell 's the same whether beetles damage the wood , or people cut it . " <p> " And the red dragons come to eat the beetles , " Harysen concluded for her . " Then this wood was a gift from you ? " <p> To Harysen 's surprise , he saw tears start in Menoot 's eyes . " We wanted you out of the house , " he said , his voice high and uneven . " We wanted to see if Mom and Dad , if  --  We 're sorry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " You carved the wood , " the girl said . " The smell of it was everywhere . The birds went a little crazy . We did n't mean to wreck your whole house . " <p> " It 's all right , " Harysen repeated . " I do n't expect I 'll be living here much longer . Can you get me the white wood ? " <p> Menoot nodded miserably . <p> Weeks later , when the wardens finally sent a synth to look in on Harysen , all that was found of him were a few broken pieces of skull and mandible , both thoroughly pecked . <p> The wardens were secretly pleased to be rid of this alien infestation , and they moved quickly to ensure that another would not occur . Before any higher authority could interfere , they ruled the death as accidental , sprayed the house with a bio-accelerator and destroyed the transit booth . Once again , Weyken was a closed world . <p> Back in the cities the art community decided that Harysen 's work was worth at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest , the rhythms of life began to change . <p> <p> By Linda Nagata <p> Linda Nagata 's first novel , The Bohr Maker , won the 1996 Locus Award for Best First Novel . Her third novel , Deception Well , has just appeared from Bantam Spectra <p> She returns to our pages with " The Bird Catcher 's Children . " She says that the story had an odd beginning . " While looking at open houses , " she writes , " my husband and I stumbled across a hand-made house in ruinous condition , at the end of a pitted dirt road in a forested area . For the past several months , only birds had lived there . The isolation and unusual character of the house struck a note with me . I wan ted to use it in a story , and ultimately , it became Harysen 's house . " <p>
