People are waiting longer than ever before saying " I do . " A recent report by the U.S. Census Bureau found that in 1994 the median age for brides was 24.5 years old , and the median age for grooms was 26.7 years old . These were the oldest recorded median ages for both , according to the study which cited the latest statistics available . While the age of those walking to the altar is at a record high , many have wondered what has caused the drastic delay in getting married . Why are people staying single longer ? Fear of commitment is a major reason why many people place marriage low on their list of priorities , says sex educator Ella Patterson , who is also a motivational speaker and author of the book Will The Real Women Please Stand Up ! She says that many people are afraid to enter a relationship that could possibly lead to marriage because they have been hurt during the course of a previous committed relationship and have n't learned to deal with that pain . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you have a person who builds up a wall , it 's usually because they 've been hurt in the past , and they still have those scars . The wound still has a scab on it , but the least little thing will peel that scab off . People build up a wall so that they will not be hurt again , " Patterson explains . Patterson also notes that women once regarded marriage as their No. 1 goal , but , in today 's society , she 's noticed that women have ranked their careers as top priority . " Women are n't jumping into things like they used to . Women are waiting for others who can bring just as much to the table as themselves , especially when it comes to finances , " says Patterson . Individualism is another reason people are staying single longer , believes Dr. Dana Dennard , a clinical psychologist and co-director , along with his wife , Dr. Sharon Ames-Dennard , of the Aakhet Center , a community development center , in Tallahassee , FL . Dr. Dennard states that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being alone and that uniting with another could disrupt this sense of security . " The culture that we 're in promotes individualism . Be all you can be . People think that as an individual they have power , and to get married they think they 'll have to give up power when they 're with another person , " explains Dr. Dennard . " With this attitude you hear people say they are n't ready to give up certain things . They really think of individualism as a kind of security and stability . " // <p>
