Bill Monroe <p> Bill Monroe , the founder of bluegrass music , died on Sept. 9 after complications from a stroke . <p> Monroe , a mandolin player , grew up in Rosine , Ky. , but at the start of the Great Depression , he moved to the Chicago area and worked at an oil refinery . In 1934 he and his brother formed the Monroe Brothers . Their relationship and the band eventually fell apart , and in 1938 , Monroe formed an outfit called the Kentuckians . That group broke up , too , and in 1939 , Monroe formed his most famous outfit , the Blue Grass Boys , who eventually gave their name to their brand of virtuoso hillbilly music . Monroe ran the group like a drill sergeant , pushing his musicians to meet his standards . <p> Monroe enjoyed tremendous popularity in the ' 40s and early ' 50s , and became a huge influence on the Everly Brothers , Johnny Cash , Carl Perkins and the other King , Elvis Presley . In 1954 , at Sun Studios , Presley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon of Kentucky , " and Monroe would later perform both versions in his live show . <p> In 1993 , Monroe was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences , and just after his death it was announced that he would be inducted into the Rock &; Roll Hall of Fame . " I wanted a music of my own , " Monroe once said . " And I was going to play it the way I thought it should be played . " Ella Fitzgerald <p> On June 15 , Ella Fitzgerald , one of the great voices of the 20th century , passed away . She was 79 . <p> Fitzgerald rose above a childhood beset with abuse by a stepfather and a term in a New York state reformatory . In 1934 she began to hone her craft as the star of bandleader Chick Webb 's group and co-wrote its biggest hit , " A-Tisket , A-Tasket . " After Webb died , in 1939 , Fitzgerald went solo . Riding the wave of changing jazz and vocal styles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevated scat singing to a new , heady level . <p> In the mid- ' 50s , jazz producer Norman Granz took Fitzgerald under his wing and matched her with the work of pre-eminent songwriters such as Cole Porter , Duke Ellington , Irving Berlin , and George and Ira Gershwin . The resulting works , Fitzgerald 's Songbooks , set a standard for interpretive jazz vocal performance . " I never knew how good our songs were , " Ira Gershwin once said , " until I heard Ella Fitzgerald sing them . " <p> Fitzgerald would make several more albums for Granz as well as collaborate with Louis Armstrong , Frank Sinatra and Count Basie , but was better known for her incredible live shows . Those ended in 1992 as she became increasingly stricken with diabetes , but by then , her place in history had been secured . Timothy Leary <p> On May 31 , Timothy Leary died in his bed , surrounded by friends and family , after a long battle with prostate cancer . <p> On his way to becoming the prophet of LSD , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he and his partner Frank Barron were researching the effects of psychotherapy on patients ; in 1960 , Leary moved to a post at Harvard University . That summer , on a trip to Mexico , Leary ate a batch of psychedelic mushrooms , and the resulting trip profoundly changed his life . Leary began experimenting with acid and other mind-altering drugs at Harvard , and , in 1963 , he was fired for distributing psychedelics to students . He continued speaking on the virtues of LSD at college campuses , as well as at love-ins and other events across the country . " He was a mischievous Irishman ; he was full of fun and had a great twinkle in his eye , " says Ray Thomas , lead singer of the Moody Blues , who canonized Leary in their 1968 song " Legend of a Mind . " " The first time I met him , I did n't know whether he was the sanest person I had ever met or totally off the wall . " <p> In 1970 , Leary escaped from a California prison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and spent the next three years dodging authorities all over the world . In 1973 , U.S. officials arrested him in Afghanistan ; Leary subsequently spent three years in prison . After his release , he became a popular lecturer and author , as well as a prominent figure on the Hollywood party circuit . In the ' 80s and ' 90s , he became a proponent of the personal-computer revolution and was an early champion of both virtual reality and the Internet . <p> Leary 's final days were chronicled on an elaborate personal World Wide Web site that simulated his home and featured images of the counterculture icon on his deathbed . According to a family member , Timothy Leary 's last word before he passed away was , " Beautiful . " " Chas Chandler " <p> Manager and bassist Bryan " Chas " Chandler , who died July 17 , first gained prominence while playing bass with the Animals but is perhaps best known for his discovery of Jimi Hendrix . <p> Chandler got his musical start in the late 1950s with the Alan Price Combo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it renamed itself the Animals . <p> Profoundly influenced by American rhythm &; blues , the Animals had a No. 1 hit on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean in 1964 with " House of the Rising Sun . " Other Animals hits included " We Got ta Get Out of This Place , " " Do n't Let Me Be Misunderstood " and " See See Rider . " <p> In 1966 the original Animals broke up , and Chandler began guiding the careers of Seattle-born guitarist Hendrix  --  going by the name Jimmy James at the time  --  as well as British rockers Slade . Chandler encouraged Hendrix to move from New York to London , where Chandler hired drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding to complete the lineup for the Jimi Hendrix Experience . <p> Chandler went on to produce Hendrix 's first two albums , Are You Experienced ? and Axis : Bold as Love . He ended his relationship with the singer during the recording of Electric Ladyland , frustrated with the amount of time that Hendrix spent in the studio . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's death , in 1970 , Chandler and Hendrix were working toward a reconciliation . " Jimi was looking to get Chas back as his manager when Hendrix died , " says Janie Hendrix . " Chas was a tough businessman who always went to bat for his artists . " <p> " We were the best of friends during the best of times , " says former Animals lead singer Eric Burdon . " I 'm sad that I was n't able to have one last drink with him . " Mario Savio <p> In the fall of 1964 at the University of California at Berkeley , the United States entered a new stage in its history : In places of privilege , ordinary people once again in the San Francisco Bay Area . Regional business interests demanded an end to what they considered harassment , and the university  --  defined by its then-president , Clark Kerr , as a " knowledge factory " meant to serve American productivity  --  responded by banning all political activity on campus : distributing literature , collecting donations , circulating petitions , publicizing meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi , where they had spent the summer in a campaign to establish the right of black Mississippians to exercise their rights as citizens ; three of their co-workers had been murdered . Now they found their own rights questioned . <p> Among those students was Mario Savio , who died Nov. 6 , at the age of 53 , in Sebastopol , Calif . In 1964 , he was a 21-year-old majoring in philosophy . Savio helped form the Free Speech Movement , whose members ranged from Students for Goldwater to the communist W.E.B . Du Bois Club . As Savio put it while looking back in 1965 : " The Berkeley students now demand what hopefully the rest of an oppressed white middle class will some day demand : freedom for all Americans , not just for Negroes ! " <p> That idea was a paradox in those days , when the campuses of great public universities were almost all white , and during the coming months , the entire university community was convulsed by it . There were fruitless negotiations , sit-ins , daily rallies and , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and police violence in the midst of a grand convocation , historic events . Finally , nobody talked about anything else  --  but everybody talked , many as never before . <p> From the first , Mario Savio emerged as the principal spokesman of the FSM . There was often a scary rush in his speeches , sometimes a tense , brittle calm , but always vehemence  --  an insistence that choices were being made as you listened , which meant that you , too , had to choose . " He took the mantle , " says Rolling Stone Editor Jann Wenner . " He rose to it . That probably took five years off his life . " Savio seemed to embody not just will but also doubt , and the need to speak and act in the face of doubt . <p> " We have an autocracy which runs this university , " Savio said on Dec. 2 , 1964 , speaking to a huge crowd moments before beginning the climactic demonstration of the Free Speech Movement . " It 's managed . I ask you to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board of regents are the board of directors , and if President Kerr in fact is the manager , then I tell you something : The faculty are a bunch of employees , and we 're the raw material ! But we 're a bunch of raw material that do n't mean to be , have any process put upon us  --  do n't mean to be made into any product  --  do n't mean , do n't mean to end up being bought by some clients of the university , be they government , be they industry , be they organized labor , be they anyone . We 're human beings ! " <p> Then came the words with which Savio 's name will always be linked . " There 's a time , " he said  --  with the word time extended as Van Morrison might have extended it , dragged out , then pulled back in  --  " when the operation of the machine becomes so odious , makes you so sick at heart , that you ca n't take part ; you ca n't even tacitly take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the gears and upon the wheels , upon the levers , upon all the apparatus , and you 've got to make it stop . And you 've got to indicate to the people who run it , to the people who own it , that unless you 're free , the machine '  --  and here a cadence pressed upon the words as they went into the air , weighting each one with an immovable determination  --  " will be prevented from working at all . ' <p> And that , over the next days , is just what happened . Over the next several years , all across the country , it happened again and again . <p> At the 30th-anniversary FSM reunion , in 1994 , only a certain bitter burr was missing from Savio 's voice . He had long since absented himself from public life ; he had understood from the beginning that in public affairs , celebrity only absolves others from making their own choices . This day , 30 years later , he had been asked , he said with a laugh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't my job , " he said . " I know what my job has been all these years . This is n't my job . But I 'm going to try to do it anyway . ' <p> Savio did n't explain that day what his job had been ; in a way , his death explained for him . His job was never to betray the history he and others had once made . That was the best way to ensure that it would be a story that would hold its shape and continue to be told . Savio 's job was never to trade away whatever moral authority had attached itself to him  --  not for power , respectability , comfort or peace of mind . <p> In his last months , Savio was again speaking out  --  in his own community , at the university where he was teaching  --  against Proposition 209 , the California ballot initiative that meant to end all affirmative action against discrimination based in race or gender in California . It passed just four days after Savio suffered the heart attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Had history come full circle ? The purpose of Proposition 209 was to inaugurate a movement to roll the country back to the days when , as in 1964 in the San Francisco Bay Area , there was only one form of affirmative action , for white men . The day after Savio 's death , five Berkeley students chained themselves to the campus tower in protest of the initiative and were arrested ; hundreds more marched through the campus . " We are able to do what we 're doing because of Mario Savio , ' one student , Anthony Weathington , 20 , told a reporter . " When he died , he passed the torch on to us .
