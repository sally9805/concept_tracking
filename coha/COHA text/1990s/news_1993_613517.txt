<p> New York <p> By age 37 , you figure you 've amassed enough inner security to withstand those first-day-of-class jitters . But when the taxi dropped me off in front of Peter Kump 's New York Cooking School , I regressed to a former , fragile self , specifically an incoming kindergartner beseeching his mother to take him home . <p> The scene that awaited me at the top of a steep stairwell did little to replenish my lost aplomb . There , bunched around a table , stood my nine fellow students , all brandishing long , brilliant knives . In my mind 's eye , they could just as well have been samurai warriors . Hey , this was the bonkers Big Apple . What if I spilled blueberry puree on one of their spotless aprons ? <p> As it turned out , the paranoia was unwarranted . After the first couple of hours of communal chopping , dicing , peeling and mincing ( among other activities that require a 10-inch blade ) , I realized that my comrades , like me , were on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter Kump , one of Manhattan 's elite culinary academies , to learn the fundamentals of good cooking and enrich our lives . <p> While I 'm still tentative in the kitchen ( cooking school does n't magically make you an accomplished chef ) , I did come away from the five- day course , entitled " Basic French Technique , " with the tools to set out on my own . The cardinal principles of French cooking had been drilled into me like the multiplication tables had been in elementary school . My grasp of equipment tightened a bit . Our class memento - a fat , loose-leaf notebook crammed with pointers , recipes and personal observations - has already come in handy at a couple of dinner parties . <p> There 's a lot more to cooking , I found out , than whisking up silken sauces . Especially in the cramped Peter Kump test kitchens , which are set up to give students a feel of what it 's like to work in a restaurant . We scurried about , competing for space on four-burner ranges or for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan Fenlin , who was eight months pregnant , negotiated this treacherous landscape ) . Sometimes I felt like a subject in a Darwinian experiment . The kitchen is a pressure cooker , and only the fit survive . <p> I can see how the food business breeds mammoth egos . Susan Sommovigo , an experienced amateur cook , and Michael Weitzman , an aspiring restaurateur , clashed on several occasions , including one memorable flap over whether to blanch green vegetables with the lid on or off ( uncovered , thank you ) . Our instructor , Ruth Van Waerebeek , played Solomon in these disputes . " Now children , " she said at one point , a warm smile crinkling her face , " I do n't want any more trouble . " <p> " Hey , Ruth , if he gives you trouble , just smack him , " advised Weitzman 's father , Stephen . <p> I 'm not trying to portray cooking school as a complete grind . The sight of a light , puffy souffle or a golden tarragon chicken ( assuming your labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aching feet . No pain , no chocolate mousse . <p> In fact , the school boasts about the intensity of its classes , even those designed for the hobbyist . The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 's decision to send me to Peter Kump was based partly on the school 's reputation , partly on the fact that it offered a short , participatory summer program ( Monday through Friday , 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. ) pertaining more to pleasure than professionalism . While French in approach , the $ 525 course stresses techniques that transcend borders and allow one to fit comfortably into any kitchen . For a food writer in search of hands-on experience , it seemed like the right fit . <p> School began promptly the first day . One by one , we introduced ourselves and gave our reasons for signing up . It was apparent that cooking school was a fashionable pastime . <p> " Hi , I 'm Susan , and my husband and I go out to dinner in Manhattan every night , " Fenlin , 31 , said . But her due date was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving to New Jersey . She made it sound like gastronomic death . <p> " I 'm going to be stuck in the suburbs with a baby and cooking for my husband . " Thus , the need for a crash course . <p> ( I squeezed in beside Fenlin on Monday , but she politely asked me to move , perhaps sensing my klutziness ) . <p> The class was less of a pressing matter for Shirley Stewart , 53 , who lived on the Upper East Side , walking distance from the school . She wanted to rekindle her passion for cooking after a career in advertising and real estate . Later in the week , she told me that the school was the latest in a series of " midlife presents " she was giving herself , the first two being a spa vacation and cosmetic surgery on her face . <p> " You want to experience things before you 're physically unable to , should it ever come to that , " Stewart said , giving me a faraway look . <p> Catherine Perot ( the blonde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 , told us she was a Texan who had just graduated from the University of North Carolina with a degree in political science . She had painted as a child , she said , and the creativity in cooking appealed to her . <p> Hmmm . Perot , politics , Texas . Was there a hidden connection here ? I asked her during some down time , out of earshot of everyone . Well , Jumping Jehoshaphat , she is Ross Perot 's daughter . I agreed to keep it to myself . <p> Amy Wolfe , 22 , had been a close friend of Catherine Perot during their days at a Dallas boarding school . She too had just graduated from college - the University of Oklahoma - where she majored in communications . Wolfe wanted to build on her repertoire of Caesar salad , sausage and cabbage roll . <p> Sherry Karpen , 47 , a full-time mother of two , had the best opening line : " The thing I do best is make the reservations . " We surmised that she enjoyed exquisitely prepared dishes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weitzmans , 23 and 49 , said they were planning to open a cafe in New Jersey by the end of the year . " I never want to be in the situation where if the chef walks out , the business collapses , " said the father , making plain their reason for attending . They related to each other in an argumentative but comic way , and their Borscht Belt routine kept my spirits up while I peeled potatoes and julienned carrots . Having worked in food-related professions , Alfred Siesel , 64 , a public relations man specializing in cookware , and Sommovigo , 35 , a marketer for the Lenders bagel company , came in with some expertise . They yearned for more knowledge , however , and a feel for presentation . <p> The class always started with Van Waerebeek going over that particular day 's four-course menu ( made by the class with fresh ingredients supplied by the school ) and demonstrating the proper prep and cooking techniques . We followed along on our worksheets , which contained quizzes on major points . Our 33-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information . She also spoke faultless English . <p> Although the Kump philosophy favors methods that are applicable to a broad range of dishes , Van Waerebeek seemed anchored in classical French ways . When she held up a whisk or a sieve or a copper bowl , she struck me as a figure who would have felt at home in the kitchens of the 18th century . " You ca n't cook without butter . Would you ask a painter to paint without oil ? " she asked at one point . <p> When the time came to bring out our knives and cutting boards , we 'd divide into two groups . I usually ended up with Perot , Wolfe , Sommovigo , Fenlin and occasionally Michael Weitzman . Sommovigo , the most confident among us , assigned tasks . <p> I figured out how to cut veggies into rows and columns without lifting the tip of my chef 's knife off the board . Tres bien . I wedged the knuckles of my left hand against the object I was cutting so as not to expose my fingertips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast ; even the home cook , she said , should complete each phase of a meal in a set time . <p> One of my favorite menus was gazpacho , lamb chops topped with seasoned butter , roasted potatoes and orange slices au jus , spiked with Grand Marnier . <p> There could be no white skin left on the orange . The slices had to be thin and identical . No easy feat for me , but a cinch for Perot , who was quite taken with the aesthetic challenge of cooking . <p> I asked her if appreciation for the culinary arts ran in her family . <p> In her father 's case , apparently not . One wintry evening , she told me , he placed a couple of cans of ice cold dog food in hot water " and they exploded . Dad was cleaning dog food off the ceiling . " <p> It made me feel better to know that my cooking skills exceeded Ross Perot 's . No canine vittles ( or human , for that matter ) ever went boom in the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a food processor . I consumed such delicacies as foie gras . And now , I could roast a pepper , truss a chicken and braise a head of broccoli . <p> Well , no one ever called me James Beard or Jacques Pepin . But if you come to my next dinner party , I might show you how to mince a shallot . <p> For information on how to enroll in Peter Kump 's New York Cooking School , call 212-410-4601 or write the school at 307 East 92nd Street , New York , N.Y . 10128.
