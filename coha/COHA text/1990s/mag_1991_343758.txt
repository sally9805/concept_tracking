With the recession hanging on like a pall , many of the nation 's big retail outlets are beginning to resemble mausoleums . Merchandise sales are dismally flat this year . Still , not every store is an echo chamber . A few novel retailing ideas have captured the attention of otherwise moribund buyers . The success of some may signal that shopping preferences and rituals are changing , while others may be nothing more than passing fads . As the great philosopher Confucius  --  yes , Confucius !  --  once said , " To open a shop is easy ; to keep it open is an art . " Here are three works of modern retailing art that are bucking the trend : <P> THE WET SEAL Americans bore easily , and few know this better than Ken Chilvers , president of the Wet Seal . This hip California-based chain of 97 clothing stores has branched into sun-filled states such as Hawaii , Arizona and Florida . Revenues , $107 million last year , have climbed 972% since 1985 , when the 17-store Seal was awash in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million stock offering . <P> The Seal 's secret : trendy merchandise is constantly turned over , while employees are handed weekly bonuses to help push it out the door . The chain 's concept is " multigenerational , " which in plain Valleyspeak means that gum- snapping , Walkman-toting ingenues and their miniskirted moms can sport the same fashions , from flowered denim shorts to psychedelic bikinis . " We do n't just ask our customers what they want , " points out Chilvers . " We spend a tremendous amount of time in the malls , in our competitors ' stores . I hang around and watch what they buy , what they do n't buy . " <P> Wet Seal stores are large and dramatic ( 3,900 sq . ft. on average ) , and the merchandise is displayed all the way up to the ceiling on high-tech impressionistic wire mannequins bathed in track lighting . Tops , pants , shorts and jackets are often clustered in the same spot for customers who ca n't match clothes on their own . Many stores also boast a 25-screen video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using computers , boasts marketing director Lesly Martin , " our buyers were actually able to track the day neon beachwear died . " Radical ! <P> THE NATURE CO . This is the neo-naturalist 's answer to wet seals . No rock videos here , though . Enter these stores and you 're more likely to hear the babbling of a brook or the haunting song of a whale , sniff the fragrance of freshly brewed chamomile tea or gaze through dappled lighting meant to resemble sunlight in a forest . " People come in and say , ' Ahhh ! ' , " says Anita Treash , the company 's marketing director . <P> The Nature Co. is a prime example of " greentailing , " or riding the wave of the environmental movement . The eco-chain started life in 1973 as one small shop near the University of California , Berkeley , campus run by a pair of Peace Corps veterans . Today the Nature Co. , owned by the CML Group of Acton , Mass. , has 54 stores and is moving into Europe and Japan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up 29% from 1990.
