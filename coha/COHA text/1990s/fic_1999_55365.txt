Julio Zamora has never applied for a green card ; he works as a fast-food cook . His oldest son , Manuel , loves the comic books I bring him every week . " Who 's this ? " he 'll say . <p> " Spiderman . Tough hombre . He can eat fourteen burritos in eight minutes while hanging , half-asleep , on the wall . " <p> " I can eat fifteen upside down ! " <p> I think of him as my own little boy , sometimes . <p> My other family , the Thuots , fled the Annam Cordillera Mountains in what 's now the Socialist Republic of Vietnam . They live with their six children in an efficiency apartment with no running water near Allen Parkway . Regularly , I bring them food and job applications from various convenience stores ; they teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are precisely the kind of people no one  --  repeat , no one , zero , zip  --  wants to read about , Cal of Cal 's Books is telling me now , placing his hands on his dusty front counter . Next to the cash register , a chipped fishbowl is gorged with slips of paper  --  a promotional gimmick . Cal 's always got one going . Trips . Bonus prizes . At the end of the month he 'll hold a raffle . Four free books . <p> " George , my customers want a peek at the secret lives of celebrities . Money , scandal , divorce .... " he says . " They 're after books that 'll teach them better love techniques . " <p> Indian myths , black oral histories , Cajun culture guides , Mexico , Asia  --  these subjects are death , he says . Pure death . Business is slow for my Texas Republic Press . <p> " At least take a look at what I 've done , " I say . I 'm the founder , publisher , editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which I 'm very proud  --  an amiable armadillo branded with a big Lone Star ) . Today , I 'm the sales rep . <p> Cal takes my sample copy of Houston 's Latin Refugees , a one-hundred-page cultural study of families like the Zamoras . I 'm also the writer . <p> " Sorry , George . I would n't be able to sell it . If you could get me something sexy ... " <p> " Be serious , Cal . " <p> " Never more . " <p> " All right , forget it . " Shaking my head , I glimpse , briefly , an exterminator 's truck , backfiring as it rattly-clacks down the street . A giant foam-rubber bug 's belly-up on its hood . X 's for eyes . The truck is followed closely by a pizza delivery van , pepperonis painted like measles on its dark-purple doors . <p> Successful commerce : in the fast lane , way ahead of me . <p> I scribble the names of the Thuots and the Zamoras on uneven ribbons of paper , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of his teenaged nephew , Ray , taped to the register 's side as an ad for his " Family Novels " sale ( " 20% Off ! " ) . The boy looks just like his uncle , but neater , with a slender goatee . I met him here when he worked part-time last summer , and took to him right away . He was trying to save for his first car and to help with family expenses . <p> His dad , Cal 's brother Billy , was recovering from prostate surgery , something Ray could n't talk about without choking up . I knew what that was like , and I felt for the kid . <p> " Mr. Palmer , good to see you again , " he greeted me whenever I came in . Kind . Helpful . Polite . He always took the time to glance through my pamphlets and books , said he 'd talk them up to his uncle . He loved showing me , and anyone else , the latest issues of Consumer Reports , dogearing pages of jazzy red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A boy to make a daddy proud . If I were speaking to him now , or any humane person , I might be making progress . <p> Well . Cal and I are used to each other . <p> " These people you talk to , George , they have , you know what I mean , kinky love practices , do n't they ? Fertility rites ? Stuff like that ? " he asks . His beard 's about to wilt in the heat . A soggy gray dishtowel . " That I could use . " <p> " Thanks for your time , Cal . " I snatch back the book . <p> The Zamoras live now near a black college in the projects . Most families here are too poor to buy new shoes , or to repair their old ones , yet they have no sidewalks to use  --  only slim dirt paths under splintered telephone poles near the street . The lines between the poles are loosely strung over gardens and lawns , within easy reach of a child swinging a stick , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slugger  --  something I 'd fix right away , pronto , andale , if I had kids here . The fire hydrants , busted , are dry . <p> The Zamoras ' house is pink with dark-green eaves . Spike cactus blooms on either side of the porch . A stiff plastic hose curls on a peg by the door . <p> When I arrive  --  it 's a ten-minute drive from Cal 's  --  Julio 's trying to figure out the plumbing in his kitchen . He tells me he 's just spent $780 on a new washer and dryer . <p> I say , " Can I give you a hand ? " <p> " Sure . Grab that wrench for me . " <p> Some afternoons he cooks hamburgers at a Prince 's Drive-In ; two nights a week he fries shrimp at a Chinese takeout on Wheeler . Eight months ago , he and his wife , Lira , and their five children lived in a small apartment in the Fourth Ward , behind a Southern Pacific Railroad crossing . Now , with two jobs , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtown today ? " I ask . <p> " Yeah . Pounding those fucking doors . " <p> " No luck ? " <p> " Naw . I tell her she 's gon na have to try a little harder . Small businesses , banks . " She 's been looking for work for a year . " Earn her keep around here . " He laughs , but the ripple in his throat is shallow and sad . <p> Twice in the last year , I 've noticed bruises on Lira 's cheeks . Once , she had a black eye . She wo n't talk about herself . " Every morning at eight , she catches a Metro bus downtown and interviews all day , " Julio explained to me once . " Then she comes home at seven to fix dinner for the children . " <p> Last week , on a whim , I stopped by while Julio was still at work . I was hoping to get her to chat . Of course , the timing was bad ; she was exhausted from the bus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Off ! " she howled , like someone in near-fatal distress  --  while she pulled knives and spoons , pots and pans , from cupboards , cabinets , drawers . Awkwardly , I asked how she was doing . She just smiled . Fidgeting , wishing I could vanish through the floorboards , I told her I 'd recently seen up-to-date employment guides in my friend Cal 's bookstore . She said she 'd check them out . Then , politely , " Excuse me . " <p> " Sure , " I said , and left as quickly as I could . <p> Now , as Julio and I hammer beneath the sink , Manuel , his eight-year-old  --  my favorite kid ; always happy , active as a beetle  --  sings into my portable tape recorder : " No llores , Jesus , no llores/ Que nos vos a hacer llorar. / Pues los ninos de este pueblo/ Te queremos consolar . " <p> Julio laughs . " What a morbid little song . " " No Llores , " he says , is a funeral dirge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jot that down . <p> Years ago , in an informal study when I started the press , I discovered that white Houston often stereotypes Mexicans according to food behavior ( " greaser , " " pepper-belly , " " frijole-guzzler " ) . Now , I want to know what Latins whisper about nortenos . <p> After the washer 's hooked up in the pantry , Julio opens a plastic tub of salsa , along with a bag of tortilla chips , and sets them on his rickety kitchen table . Manuel listens to the Astros on the radio . <p> The house is packed to its peeling pine rafters with keepsakes , toys , pages of jubilant scribbles by the kids , the sweet and sour smells of brimming life : gifts I expected to gather someday myself , I think , glancing fondly at Julio 's boy before we settle down to work . <p> " OK , how do we start ? " Julio asks . <p> " Well , " I say , switching on the recorder . Shaky  --  over what ? what the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . " Do you have certain names  --  derogatory terms  --  for Anglos ? " <p> " Let me see . Yes . Sometimes we call you Jamones . " <p> " What does it mean ? " <p> " Ham-eaters . You know , you 're big eaters of pork . " <p> " What else ? " <p> " Bolillo , Rolling Pin . Because of the way you move , I suppose , straight-ahead , arrogant . I never really knew , it 's just something I heard from my father . He used to tell us stories at night  --  big hombre , dark like an African . He taught me nothing is more important than family . " <p> I nod . <p> " Nino , family , it 's the solid rock of life , he used to say . " He laughs , then gestures at the blinking red light on my machine . " So . This will be another book ? " <p> " Maybe part of one , " I say . " I do n't know . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee , surprising me . He 's always surprising me , switching gears  --  happy to sad , wistful to tough . In all our talks , I 've yet to learn how to read him . " Whatever happens , you must n't quit , George . It 's a good thing you 're doing , telling our stories to the Anglos . " <p> I rub my eyes ; before my zero , my zip , with Cal today , I logged eight-and-a-half hours at the newspaper . <p> " I swear , George , you work like a damn Mexican . " Julio chuckles . " We should quit this , eh ? You need to go home , I think , and let your lady make you a spicy dinner . Some beans , maybe , smothered in butter ? A beer . " <p> Children shout , playing catch down the street . " If I had a lady , " I say , a barb , a derogatory dart aimed solely at myself , but here it is , gasping out in the open : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time in months . <p> Shit , I think , flushing hot . <p> " A nice lookin ' fellow like you , no lady ? " Julio 's mood 's still light . He thinks we 're kidding , as usual . <p> My hands are trembling now . I almost tell him , The freeway ate her up , man . Swallowed her whole . But he does n't need to know this . His world 's overstuffed already  --  washers , dryers , big black eyes . <p> " Anglos . " He tsks . " Always too busy for love . You do n't know how to appreciate a good woman . " <p> " You 're right , " I say . <p> " Sometimes , when I see white folks dance ? " <p> " Yeah ? " <p> " I think , how can they be so clumsy with their bodies , and still make babies ? " <p> I try to laugh . <p> " No , really , " Julio says . He touches my shoulder , man to man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes later , leaving , I see at the end of the block Lira , gripping a grocery bag , step from a steaming silver bus . I wave through my windshield , but she does n't see me . Her eyes are on her own front door  --  a wide , cautious stare , like keeping sight of a possibly rabid animal . She 's lovely , a deep , rich brown , her bare arms slightly muscled , her blouse and green skirt neat despite what I imagine to be the hardships of her day ( " Looks to me , lady , like you 've got no real experience . Sorry " ) and the indignity of pressing bus crowds . Proofreader ? Editorial assistant ? But I ca n't afford to hire anyone . <p> I wave again . She still has n't noticed my car 's slow turning . Julio 's waiting , now , in the doorway . Her stride quickens . She grasps the bag so tight it tears a bit at the bottom . Somewhere nearby , children laugh and scream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Thuots are tenser than my sessions with Julio Zamora . A year ago , when ! first met them , they stood with arms folded and gave me a very wide berth . Later , a teacher friend of mine told me that , in most Asian cultures , folding one 's arms is a gesture of honor ; distance signals respect . In time the Thuots sang into my tape recorder , shared stories and jokes . They showed me the bracelets they 'd made from American artillery scraps . <p> Mr. Thuot is stooped , wrinkled , and dark . His wife is tall , with slender , peach-colored ears . They have four boys and two girls , none of them getting an education at the moment , though three of the boys are old enough for high school . Their apartment overlooks a deep part of the bayou ; beyond it , the rice mills of American Grain , gleaming , white , tall as rockets . <p> The family bathes in water from the stream . Mr. Thuot and the boys haul it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their room . I 've told them the bayou 's polluted  --  I 've seen car doors , portable freezers , bicycle mirrors , rusting in the mud . The Thuots always drink the fresh Ozarka water I bring , shear the plastic bottles in half , and use them to carry dirty bathwater up the banks . <p> Tonight the streets are muggy and hot . A thin , steamy film clings to the bayou 's surface . <p> I hand Mr. Thuot a stack of employment applications  --  gas stations , grocery stores  --  saving some for Lira Zamora , when next the Great Bus drops her off . My nerves have leveled out since I left Julio 's place , but I 'm more eager than usual to finish my business , run deal poker with my motley officemates , and get my mind off myself tonight . <p> " Thank you , " Mr. Thuot says . No smile . <p> He sits on the couch , back straight , waiting for me to turn on my Sony . " We do n't have to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curtly , he nods , waves his hand . His English is good . ! love his family stories . I 'm the bearer , now , of other families ' stories . <p> " More about my birthplace ? " he asks . " My  --  how do you put it  --  my origin ? " <p> " What have n't we covered so far ? " <p> " Grandfather . Distant cousins . Yes ? " He hands me a blue dish filled with slices of orange , offers me green tea . <p> Last August , on my first visit here , I learned that his home village , a series of bamboo huts in the Annam Cordillera highlands , was named Kontum . A lush , fertile place , brimming with kids . Mr. Thuot had been a farmer and fisherman . The streams were treacherous , full of crocodiles , so for luck he 'd tattooed a winding green snake on his chest ( a folk practice I 've traced with some certainty to the fourteenth century , and the reign of Hung Vuong ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the mountains , married couples often whispered sibling terms  --  " Yes , my brother , yes , yes ! "  --  while making love : a practice common , also , in Thailand . <p> " How about this , instead , " I tell Mr. Thuot now . " Could you share with me intimate words for the pleasures you feel with your wife ? " <p> For a moment , as I speak , my mind loops back to Jean , her small , puckered mouth trying desperately to tell me something . <p> Mr. Thuot trusts me , and usually enjoys our talks , but he seems , this evening , grim . The tape hisses , and we avoid each other 's eyes . <p> Finally I tuna off the recorder and start to leave . Mrs. Thuot , worried that her husband has offended me ( her primary domestic duty , as far as I 've ever been able to tell , is constantly to sweep unpleasantness out of her home ) , motions for me to sit back down . She rummages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three small gongs : metal , with upturned rims . Excitedly , she gestures for her husband to explain . <p> " He is not interested  --  " <p> " Yes , " I say . " I am . Please . " My own English always stiffens around him . <p> Delicately , he touches each gong . " These we use on several occasions , " he tells me . " Funerals , feasts . We had many gongs , but three was all we could pack , fleeing the war . The largest is called Knah . Part of a set of six . When they are stored together , one inside the other , they form concentric circles . The smaller gongs are Ching . They come in sets of three . We use at family dinner . " <p> Mrs. Thuot mimes the picking of chopsticks . I laugh and join her . Mr. Thuot smiles , raises his glass of tea  --  " To the children , " he toasts , " to the high sky of their future , yes ? "  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ching . <p> " A family , it  --  they ?  --  vanished last night , " Mrs. Thuot tells me as I 'm leaving . We 're standing in a vacant lot behind her apartment , where I 've parked my dusty Chrysler . " Right over there . That one . " She points to an unpainted door in the next building . " This is why my husband is distracted for you . " Her eyes mist . She ca n't go on just now . <p> In this part of town , " vanished " could mean anything . Deported . Chased away by crack dealers , Chicano gangs , black gangs , white gangs , Asian gangs . Shot to death . <p> " It scares me when they vanish , " she says . <p> " Yes . " As if to punctuate her thought , tires squeal in the darkness down by the bayou . " Do you have everything you need right now ? " I ask . <p> She smiles sadly . We squeeze hands . " People need so much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I know . " I kiss her lilac-scented cheek . " I know . " <p> 3 . My own family vanished a year ago on the Gulf Coast Freeway . " Freak , " said the first officer on the scene . In my daze I thought he meant me , for surviving , and I agreed with him . " No no . " He put his arm around my shoulder . " I meant the accident . " <p> All I remember of the moment itself is a candy-red pickup veering into our lane : lawn mowers , trash barrels , rakes , in its bed . Then I 'm standing by the road , in the hot , sucking wind of cars going past , telling the officer my name . <p> How do I explain all this  --  my particular clumsiness , my white-boy sadness  --  to Julio Zamora ? Or to anyone ? Plain , careful English hardly seems adequate , each word a slap to memory 's pale face . <p> As a folklorist , someone who 's spent his whole adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long mental list of useful quotes . " Six feet of earth make all men of one size , " says an old American proverb . James Russell Lowell , speaking of Garfield , said , " The soil out of which such men as he are made is good to be born on ... to die for and be buried in . " But no wise words came to me that day on the freeway . Instead , it was Dickens I recalled . Simple , brutal , direct . " Old Marley was dead as a doornail . " <p> I could n't see my parents or my wife . By the time I understood what was happening , emergency personnel ( strict white coats ; muted , efficient expressions ) had laid sheets across my family 's bodies . Their contours looked massive , weightier than any of them had ever really been , with their light , lovely laughter , their silly little dance steps whenever they felt happy . <p> The owner of the truck , an independent yardman , had also died in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been behind the wheel . My father 's car . Driving us to a new sushi restaurant in Galveston . All his life Dad had tooled around in behemoths  --  Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs , impervious to impact . But a negligence suit from an injured employee had wiped out his refinery company , and most of his savings ; in forced retirement , he 'd bought a tiny Honda hatchback . <p> I was the only one wearing a seatbelt : the reason I walked away , a bald , vague official told me . Later , he assured me I 'd done everything possible . No chance I could have braked in time . A bear of a cop , a kid , patted my arm a bit too heartily . " It was just , " he said , " one of those things , eh ? " <p> Blindsided , jolted from my feelings , I stayed busy , quiet , letting other people talk , interviewing the Thuots and the Zamoras . Their stories saw me through those first few awful months . Tell me more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? White folks what ? Yes , yes , we 're guilty of that , I suppose ... and much more , besides . <p> In our five years together , Jean and I had never huddled with a lawyer . Why draft wills , we thought . What did either of us own that smelled of real money ? And though we joked about aging and dying , like most people ( Look at all this hair ! My exquisite teeth ! ) we thought we 'd live forever . <p> My parents ' papers did n't specify where , or how , they wanted to be buried . I 'd never heard them discuss it . I do n't recall , in the bog of last year , how I made up my mind . I do remember worrying that if I waited too long , they 'd all mummify , like Norman Bates 's old lady in Psycho . That kind of thing happened in Houston , despite the humidity . Occasionally a story reached the paper : a cop would find the preserved body of an elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm , dry house the neighbors never checked . <p> Also I knew the folk legends . For instance , Saint Francis Xavier had been saved intact since the sixteenth century in a town called Goa , on the Indian subcontinent . Supplicants are no longer allowed to see his corpse ; a worshiper bit off his toe one year in a fever of religious ecstasy . <p> Clearly , I was n't thinking rationally when I had to let go of my family . <p> I finally settled on the Magnolia Blossom Cemetery on South Ruthyen Street , a pretty little place I 'd passed many times on my way to work . Predominantly Mexican Catholic , it contains some of the best grutas , or personal shrines , in Texas : sandstone , granite , reddish-brown lava . All its graves face east  --  sunrise , fresh hope . <p> 4 . Tonight , as I swing into the parking garage , the newspaper building blazes blue and orange under the freeway 's sodium lights . The garage smells of oil , rotting lunch meats ( from Sam 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottoms of trash cans . <p> " Evening , Bob , " I greet the security guard . <p> He hitches his belt up over the minor continent of his belly . His keys rattle . " Hiya , Mr. Palmer . " He 's lethargic and slow , with the patchy red face of a drinker . Not much good in an emergency , probably , but his presence reassures me anyway . He 's one of the city 's familiar beings , a signpost , someone whose location I can always count on to steer by . <p> I take the elevator to the fifth floor , where I type-and-enter my days . As soon as my father lost his savings ( he 'd been the chief benefactor of my fledgling little press ) , I found this job , penning obituaries and occasional fillers . <p> " Nothing fancy , now . Do n't try to be goddamn Balzac , " the managing editor , a pugnacious old gent named Penrose , told me the morning he took me on . " These days , the general public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloomy goddamn figures  --  somewhere between second and third grade . Get the picture ? You want to be literary , go park yourself on a streetcorner somewhere , shouting lousy poems about the lousy whatever . " <p> In front of Cal 's , I thought , imagining with wicked glee his apoplectic face . Free with Each Purchase , the Poem of the Day ! Bodice Rippers : A Sonnet . Miles to Read Before I Sleep . Ode to a Glass-Bottomed Bookmobile . ( A year or so ago , before tumbling oil prices pinched his sales , Cal bought a custom-made van as an advertising gimmick . Plexiglas , solid , tinted brown . Every customer who plunked down a hundred dollars or more would get a ride in the bookmobile .... " Cruising the freeways , " Cal would say , " with only a river of sweet air between you and freedom and the road . " For a while it was a popular sales ploy . Now he 's into raffles . ) <p> " What about news ? " I asked Penrose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generating my own stories ? What about  --  " <p> " Whoa , son . Forget the news . I hand you a simple format , you fill it in . Got it ? " <p> Ode to the Status Quo . " Got it , " I said . <p> Most of my colleagues at the paper are quick and efficient , in and out of the office each day with barely a grumble or flourish , but a small group of us  --  Tony , from the church beat ( paradoxically , the profanest man I 've ever met ) ; Ed Branigan , a typesetter ; Scott Lehman , who covers the cops ; and me  --  meet late nightly for cards . None of us has family waiting at home . Tony 's separated from his wife ; Ed and Scott are both divorced . <p> We 're all insomniacs  --  which is what you say , when you 're grown , instead of admitting you 're afraid of the dark . <p> When I bustle in tonight , the boys are dealing their first round of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke swarms the snicking yellow lights . The radio 's tuned to the blues : My man 's a busted tire on a muddy old road in A labam .... <p> " George ! God , man , am I glad to see you , " Tony says . " This game sucks with just three people . " <p> " Just like love . " <p> " You in ? " <p> " I 'm in . " I stow my recordings of Julio Zamora and Mr. Thuot in my gray steel desk . <p> " Tony , man , you shuffle these cards ? " Ed asks . <p> " He never shuffles the cards , " Scott says . " Watch him . He just messes them up a little . " <p> I grab a chair . <p> " ' Shuffle ' is not in his vocabulary . ' Shuffle ' is a sacred , ancient wisdom he 's somehow failed to grasp . " <p> " Yakking with your fer'ners ? " Tony kids me . <p> " Yep . " <p> " Fuckin ' rice-eaters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and I always count quietly to ten . He runs a hand across his bald spot . It 's shaped a little like Australia . " See you and raise you , " he says . <p> " Cold , brother . " <p> " Call . " <p> " Boat . " <p> " Damn . You did n't shuffle . " Ed grabs his paunch as though he 's had a pain . <p> Tony reels off several golfing jokes involving Protestant ministers , rabbis , priests . They all end , improbably , with some form of indecent exposure . Scott and Ed are clawing into their wallets , inflicting on each other the latest snaps of their kids , tamping back tears . <p> I do n't know what I 'd do without these guys , but tonight  --  lately  --  it nags me : I 'm not sure why I 'm with them , either . <p> " You 're drifting , George , " Tony warns me . " Cut ' em . " <p> " Sorry . " I tap the tattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pale and thin from eating mostly Oreos  --  half-Oreos . He plucks them apart , then chucks the creamy side , a nod to health . Ed 's a surefire heart attack : tomorrow , the day after . You can almost hear him ticking . <p> Pathetic . And here I am . Why , now , does it bother me ? <p> " How many ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " Cards , George . How many cards ? " <p> " Oh . Two . " <p> " I know about you , " Scott told me excitedly one afternoon in the hall , near the men 's room with its river-water smell and its big red door . He 's a short , aggressive man who never finished his college psychology degree . In the middle of a call or a raise , he 'll claim he can read all our faces , sniff out our bluffs . But he always winds up losing . " What is it you think you know , Scott ? " <p> He swallowed the last of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with his cookies , and crumpled his yellow napkin . " The reason you 're so quiet . Why you 'd rather just listen to others . Tape them and stuff . " <p> " And why is that ? " <p> " The accident . " He ca n't hide his pride whenever he launches these little insight bombs . He 's lucky we still let him play with us . " You think you should have died . " <p> I stood limp against the bathroom door , like a well-thumbed poster for a long-past event . " Scott , listen  --  " <p> " Survivor guilt . Why me , right ? The miracle of your continuance . " He wrapped his fingers in his napkin and poked me in the chest . " Naturally you 're anguished about it , George , so you imagine yourself gone . " <p> " You 're full of shit , " I told him , and he grinned . <p> But more than once I 've thought he 's right ( though of course I did n't need him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be here , " he said . " Is n't that what you feel ? " <p> Tonight , as the fellows joke and laugh  --  Scott watching , gleefully , anticipating my every bluff  --  I fold and fold and fold . <p> Driving home , late , I smell the city 's labors : dirt and sweat , the soft tar of the roads , the balanced tension of girders , rust , and air . Lights pulse . Jean loved these kinds of nights , stark and steamy as only Houston can be . <p> Magnolia trees cluster around paint-peeled wooden homes on the edge of the First Ward . Moonlight glints off the glass , blue and brown , green and gold , of the downtown towers , and makes glowing whips of phone lines webbed above hot streets . <p> The no-zoned nature of Houston makes its neighborhoods a constant surprise , often funny , sometimes eerie : a palm reader next to a Republican campaign headquarters , a hot-tub dealer next to a strict-bricked Baptist church . One minute the city 's a wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing you know she 's ripped off her mask to reveal a snide , sneaky kid . <p> Tonight , my part of town  --  run-down , poor , slammed hard by AIDS  --  is dark and quiet . If I 'd had the money , I think I might have moved . But I still live in the cheap little house I shared with Jean , a two-bedroom in the old Montrose neighborhood , musty with dust and too many memories , behind a small outfit called Sno King that manufactures icemakers . They 're housed in a corrugated aluminum building ; sometimes , deep into the night , an out-of-whack icemaker flings watery cubes at the walls . Jean and I used to laugh about it , lying in bed . Or we 'd argue , after making love to a series of frozen thumps , over kids  --  the only occasions , since buying the house , we ever fought . <p> Turns out I wanted babies ; she did n't . <p> " Too settled , too tired , " she always said , like a longstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her voice , if she was capable of violence . <p> With the house , it was money . Mortgage insurance . Escrow . The usual worries . But the baby-talk  --  that riled her beyond reason . <p> " Julio 's little boy , Manuel , he 's so pretty , Jean , and lively , " I told her the night I met the Zamoras . I played her a tape of his voice . " I wish you could see him  --  " <p> " George , please . I told you before we were married I was n't interested in the diaper-mill . I 'm an old lady . " ( In her early forties , she was just a few years older than I was . ) <p> " Neither was I ... but I 've got to admit , honey , lately ... the more I 'm around certain kids  --  " <p> " Then stop it , " she said . <p> Thwack ! <p> I was a " professional fuck-up , " she told me once  --  " I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  --  but she loved me , she said , for my " empathy skills . " The first night I spent at her place , I offered to draw her a bath . She sat on her bed and cried . " No one 's ever poured me a bath , " she said . " It 's the sweetest thing . " She reached for my hand . I dried her face with a towel . " You 're a caretaker type , are n't you ? " <p> I 'd never thought of myself that way , but I liked who I was in her eyes . She was a physics professor at Rice , and provided me stability , maturity , calm . We made  --  as folks like to say here in pigskin-crazy Texas  --  a pretty good team . <p> Now each ping recalls her face . " Tony was the big winner tonight , " I tell her . Gauzy as frost , she 's wafting in front of my pillow . Every night she visits like this , in a pale white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty bucks . Pathetic . " <p> She circles my head like a pigeon . ! curse my imagination . With a punch of my pillow ( aiming straight for its cottony heart ) , Jean disappears , replaced by the vibrant spirits of my current life : Mrs. Thuot sipping tea , Manuel shouting joyfully in the street , Lira hiding a puffy red welt on her face .... <p> Fuck . I shut my eyes and try to ease my breathing . <p> Two years ago  --  three ?  --  Jean planted a skinny apple tree in our front yard . Now it whispers in a fiat southerly breeze . <p> Shhh . Shhh . <p> 6 . I hate to impose myself on the Thuots and the Zamoras on Saturdays and Sundays : after running around all week , looking for work , scrambling for food , they 've earned a rest from the great white world . <p> So I drive to the Shamrock Six , a multiplex cinema catering mostly to blacks . What I like about the place is its family feel . Several generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shout at the old-hat plots  --  murder mysteries , love stories  --  and so confirm their fellowship together , their superiority to the fools on-screen . It 's the most southern place in town , like a holy-roller country church . " Yeah ! You got it , slick ! " the audience will scream at actors moving stiffly toward a shootout or a teary embrace . <p> " Brother dead ! " <p> " No he ai n't , he gon na rip that sucker 's drawers ! " <p> " Fine-lookin ' mama ! " <p> Meanwhile , the rest of Houston , belonging more to the wide-open West , whips about in cars , usually one person per set of wheels ( after all , carpooling 's a sin against rugged individualism ) , pursuing happiness , Manifest Destiny , today 's equivalent of gold  --  a new makeover , a microwave oven , a seat behind home plate . <p> Today , Blood Orgy is showing at the Shamrock , and I 'm mighty content with my popcorn and my spot in the back row , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families laughing , quibbling , jostling for a view of the screen . An old woman wipes a baby 's face . Two boys wrestle over a Milky Way bar . A middle-aged couple sneaks a swift kiss . Then we 're drenched in humming blue light , and an actress appears to be swallowed by an alien werewolf , or a radioactive schnauzer  --  I ca n't tell . <p> I sit through two showings , filling up on Diet Cokes and the warmth of the people around me . <p> Outside , after four-and-a-half hours in the dark , I see a big man the color of burlap grasp a woman 's chin beneath the grimy marquee . " You look at me when I 'm talking to you ! " he says . " That compute wit ' you , bitch ? " They 're standing in a sweaty crowd of kids . When he drops his hand , the woman closes her eyes and rubs her face , slowly . I try to adjust my eyes . <p> Naturally , I 'm reminded of Lira Zamora . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own .... <p> In the presence of actual violence , I realize , now , how flimsy these little evasions are . I 've been an asshole . For months . Doing nothing . Talking to ghosts . Dreaming of jackpots . <p> Move ! I think , but I simply stand and watch the couple . Eventually they shuffle away , his hand a fat clamp on her arm . <p> The sun feels cold on my head . <p> Monday evening I swing by the Zamoras ' at seven , just as I figure Lira is stepping off the bus ( and Julio 's still got half an hour at the takeout ) . For an icebreaker  --  thwack !  --  I 've brought a couple new Spidermans for Manuel , and a copy of Job Opportunities : Houston and Environs for Lira . Cal let me have it at half-price  --  turns out it 's a year out of date . <p> She 's not happy to see me . As she walks from the bus at the corner , Manuel runs past me on the porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shouts , grabbing his jeans . <p> " Oh no ! I 'm ... I 'm losing my strength ! " I wither onto the lawn . <p> " Ha ha ! The world is mine ! " He rushes into the house . <p> " Hello , " I say softly to Lira , brushing dried grass from my pants ; " Can I help you with those ? " <p> She frowns and tightens her grip on three small grocery bags . " No , thank you . " She 's got Frida Kahlo eyebrows : black and wiry , a single little rope . <p> " I 've been meaning to bring you a copy of this . " I pick the job book off the porch step . <p> In fact , I 'd spent the rest of the weekend planning my visit , what I might say . After all , it had n't gone well the first time I tried to talk to her alone . And who did I think I was ? Her rescuer ? Her hero ? Spiderman , for Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . She 's gathered her hair into a bun the size of a tennis ball . On her cheek is a dark-green bruise , big as an oak leaf . <p> " The kids ? They 're OK ? " I say . " Manuel seems  --  " <p> " Yes . Fine , " she says . In her pink-and-yellow dress , she 's not much bigger than a rolled-up map . <p> I reach to touch the swelling on her face . She startles , and I pull back . My fingers have n't felt a woman 's skin since stroking Jean 's hips in the dark . " I 'm sorry , Lira . It 's none of my business , but I 've been concerned for you . I 've been wanting to talk to you about it for a while , but  --  " I 'm aware that my words are much too intimate . I do n't know her well enough to say these things . But I guess that 's why I 'm here . " Can you tell me ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Has someone been hitting you ? " I ask , standing in the doorway . Now my cheek begins to sting . Again . In memory . Lira has n't touched me . <p> " No . No one , " she answers . <p> " Julio ? " <p> " Your concern ... your concern is very thoughtful , but  --  " <p> " Lira , I want to be your friend . " <p> She sets her bags on a coffee table . The kids are running and screaming in a back room . " Quiet ! " she yells . Then , to me : " Julio is happy to tell you his stories . But I never agreed to this . " <p> It 's true . A year or so ago I came poking around this neighborhood , risking ridicule , indifference , even violence , looking for people who would talk to me ( I 'd never been a systematic fieldworker ) . Naturally , most folks turned away . Julio , a gregarious , generous man , surprised me by welcoming me into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I do n't mean to impose on you , " I tell her now , stepping into the house . " But I 've come to care  --  care genuinely  --  for your family . " <p> " What about your own family ? " she says . " Do n't they need you ? " <p> I find I ca n't answer her . Not yet . My cheek is pounding now . <p> " Quiet ! " she screams again at her kids , stopping a heavy thumping in the back . " You want to hear a story , is that it ? " she asks me . <p> " Yes . Sure . " <p> " All right , then . " Some kind of moisture is leaking from one of the grocery bags onto the coffee table . Flies batter the screen door . She loosens her bun and grips her own hair , as if clinging to the rigging of a ship . " When I was a girl in Jalisco , my mother sent me each day to buy eggs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she begins . " It was a very busy highway , leading to big market centers far away to the west . Buses and trucks , lots of noise , keeping us all awake , my brothers and sisters , even at night . Whenever she sent me for the eggs , my mother warned me so hard to be careful  --  she wanted to impress on me the danger  --  I always cried , carrying my little basket . " <p> Dogs bark down the block . I 'm wishing I 'd jammed my Sony into my pocket , but it 's still in the car . Cicadas creak in the trees . <p> " One day I was on my way home  --  proud of the six or seven large brown eggs I 'd chosen  --  when I saw an old woman , a flower-seller clutching dozens of white roses , start to cross the road ahead of me . I looked down the highway . I heard the rumble of a truck , the shifting of its gears , awful , like a cat 's angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> The sun is setting behind Houston 's huge glass buildings , nearby . The house is getting dark . " I 'm afraid I probably can . " <p> " I shouted and shouted . I do n't know if perhaps she was deaf .... I 'll never forget her skirts , beautiful black and red , in the wind of the truck , the scattered flowers and the scream . I fell to the dirt , dropping my basket , cracking the eggs . " <p> She stands for a moment , watching light fade through her lace curtains . " I do n't even have words in my own language to describe how this memory makes me feel ... how it twists me inside ... telling stories to you , in English  --  " <p> " You just did a bang-up job , " I say . " Your English is wonderful . " <p> " Well ... " <p> " I understand what you feel , Lira . Really . " I hesitate . " I lost my family . Last year . On a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looks at me as though she 'll offer me some of her hair . <p> Just then Manuel lurches , laughing , into the room , bumping my legs , and clamps his mother 's calf . " Mama , I 'm hungry ! " <p> In a mad race , the other kids swarm her : Angelina , Roberto , Maria . Chatito , the youngest , cries from his crib in the back . <p> Lira smiles at me , wearily . " Perhaps you should join us next month for the Day of the Dead , " she says . " When people we love have left this world of sorrows , we prepare their favorite dishes for them . You know the custom ? " <p> " Yes . A sort of communion with family ghosts ? " <p> " And with those of us who , sadly , must go on . " <p> " Hungry hungry hungry ! " Manuel yelps , and I offer to watch her babies while Lira fixes supper . " Yes , yes , read to me ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " <p> When I turn to pick him up , I see Julio slouched , motionless , in the doorway . He 's holding a white apron stained with hot mustard , sweet-and-sour sauce . Sweating and tired . " George , " he says glumly . <p> " Julio . " <p> " What are you doing here ? " <p> " I dropped by to see how things were going . " <p> " Lira did n't tell me you were coming . " <p> She shivers , just slightly , rubbing her arms . " I did n't know , " she says . Shadows drape the room now . " Excuse me . " She heads for the kitchen . The kids , a noisy gaggle , scramble after her . <p> Julio stares at me strangely . Exhaustion ? Suspicion ? I 've never seen him this quiet . Have I broken a rule , entering his home , meeting his wife while he was gone ? Did I know that 's what I was doing ? <p> With tornadolike swiftness , then , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " The what ? " <p> " The last interview we did . " He shuffles into the pantry . <p> I confess , " I have n't typed it up . " <p> He squeezes his apron and tosses it into the washer . From the dryer he pulls a wad of laundry , still soggy . " Why not ? " He loves reading about his family . <p> " Julio , the press is in arrears . " <p> " Rears ? " He kicks the machine . <p> " I told you I 'm running out of money . I can barely make my house payments right now . The books do n't sell  --  " <p> " This fucker . We did n't hook it up right . " <p> " The chain stores wo n't touch them , " I tell him . " The guy at Cal 's  --  he 's the only one who 's shown any interest in the past , and even he wo n't take them anymore . To tell you the truth , I 'm wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Fuckin ' Jamone , " he says . <p> Me ? <p> Yes , he 's staring at me . The tornado has shifted paths again . A can opener buzzes in the kitchen . <p> Julio shoves a shirt and pants into the dryer . " I gave you all that information for nothing ? " <p> " No , of course not . " <p> His voice is n't loud , but he 's tapping his feet : big , bare , brown on the gritty yellow carpet . <p> I move away from him . Surely it 's the dryer , the long day at work . " I 'm looking for funding , " I say . A lie . No one 'll back me , with no hope of profit . " I 'll let you know . " <p> " To you it 's just a project , George . But it 's my goddamn file . " He slaps himself on the chest . <p> In his anguished voice I hear my wife . " It 's my body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about kids . " One little spurt and the story 's all over for you , George , but me  --  assuming my plumbing 's still working  --  I 'd swell up big as the house . No thanks . " <p> " All right , " I told her . " I understand . Forget it . " <p> " All right , " I tell Julio now . <p> " No one cares about my life , right ? My troubles . I 'll die an invisible man , like all the other wetbacks . " <p> " Julio  --  " <p> " I have to clean this apron now , George . Excuse me . " <p> " OK , " I say . " You 're right . My fault . I 'll be in touch . Honestly , Julio , your stories are still important to me . All right ? " <p> " Maybe , " he says . " Maybe not . How do I know ? " His voice shakes with rage . " Why am I the only one carrying his goddamn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his word ? " Lira drops a glass in the kitchen . Julio 's shoulders sag . " Hijo ! " he yells out the dusty pantry window at Roberto , who 's just scampered by with a ball . " Get your little ass in here and pick up your room ! I ca n't do it all ! " <p> The dryer lurches loudly at the wall . <p> Quietly , I see myself out , catching Lira 's eye . She 's somber , sadly pretty . A pair of kids hop around her . Food steams from crusty pots on the stove . Her face says , I never agreed to this . <p> 7 . In the men 's room at work I examine my stinging face . Nothing . Back in the newsroom I tell the guys about Cal . <p> " Hey , if his money 's good , and his card savvy 's poor , I have no objection to letting him join , " Ed says . " I mean , the man owns a bookstore , how savvy can he be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " the game could use fresh blood . " <p> I shuffle the deck . Nine of hearts , three of spades , queen , queen  --  both Jean . <p> There it is again . Like a wasp on my cheek . <p> " Hit me with a big one , " Scott says . <p> " Two for me . " <p> " One . " <p> The nip of a slap . <p> " George , you in this round ? " <p> " No . Deal past me . " My jaw is throbbing now . The radio hums some " dirty mama " blues . <p> I stand and slouch against the water cooler . Bubbles blast through the bottle , a tiny depth charge . My chest heaves . <p> You want a story ? Is that it ? <p> The day of the crash , Jean and I fought before we picked up my folks . <p> There . <p> It 's something I did n't want to dwell on , these past dozen months , though on some level  --  late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly above me  --  I could n't forget , of course . <p> Kids : our standard disagreement . In the city 's vaporous heat , it got out of hand . We were tired that day . All afternoon we 'd been paying bills . Cleaning the house . <p> " Sixes and sevens . " <p> " Straight . " <p> " Your deal . " <p> " Jean  --  " <p> " Stop blaming reel " <p> " Sweetie , I 'm not blaming you . You said it yourself once . I 'm the caretaker type  --  " <p> She whirled . <p> Later , on the freeway ( her slap still fierce on my cheek ) , ! noticed , just barely , the pickup swerve into my lane . Afterwards , an investigator told me , " You did n't have time to breathe , man , much less brake or change course . " But I swear I remember a second or two , an instant of instinct , when I looked into the mirror and found my wife 's chilly anger . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back in my chair . Tony slams the deck in front of me . " Cut ' em . OK , low spade in the hole splits the pot . Ante up , boys . " <p> " Pathetic , " I mumble  --  to steady my breath . <p> " What 's that ? " Tony asks . <p> Scott watches me closely . " You should n't be here , " he says , " if you 're not going to concentrate , George . " He chomps an Oreo . <p> " Hey , I 'm a survivor , " I say . " What about you ? " And I cough up the last warm quarter from my pocket . <p> Later , at home , I listen to the apple leaves outside my bedroom window . The day Jean planted the tree , she told me , " When I was little , my mother used to read me all sorts of bedtime stories , but nothing thrilled me more than the tales of Johnny Appleseed . It was the most wonderful thing , imagining him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and begged her for an apple tree in our yard . Finally my father bought one , and for years I watched it grow . " <p> I rubbed her back . She was sore from shoveling dirt . <p> " Then , in college , studying physics  --  Newton 's apple , you know ? I was delighted all over again . Gravity , spreading seeds . . . for me , apples became this solid connection to the earth . I know it sounds silly , George , but right then I swore I 'd plant an apple tree wherever I lived . " <p> " It 's not silly , " I said . I drew her a bath and washed the dirt from her arms . <p> Now she 's listing here and there , about three feet from my face . Diffuse as lamplight , she wears the cotton gloves she wore planting the tree . A faint odor of loam . <p> " Good night , " I say . She shimmers like water , then fades . " Sleep well . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first wet dream in  --  how many years ? Since long before my marriage . <p> I was walking along the bayou with Lira . The water like silk . I reached to touch a bruise on her face ; she opened her mouth and took my thumb between her lips . I felt the warmth at my waist . <p> Now the rain comes hard , stirring mud in beds where Jean used to grow marigolds , roses , lilies , thyme , and dill . The apple tree moves to and fro , like a happy child , clapping . <p> 8 . " Heads up , boyo ! Pair of first-class obits here . They need to be somber and respectful , mindful of the city 's major loss , " Penrose told me this morning . He handed me a packet of photos . A big-shot lawyer and a real estate developer . Heart attack . Stroke . <p> " No Good riddance ' ? " I said . " Oh , happy day ? " <p> " Save that searing wit for your two-bit card games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good research . But no one wants to read about it . " <p> I 'd taken a chance and shown him Houston 's Latin Refugees , suggested running it in the paper , a two- or three-part series . Community service ? Generously , he 'd agreed to look it over . <p> " It 's a downer . People want to feel good about their community . " He tapped the black-and-white face of the lawyer . " Got it ? " <p> " Yeah , " I said . Fucking Jamone . " Thanks for taking the time . " <p> On my lunch break I run by Sam 's Deli  --  Ed wanted turkey , Tony a hoagie . Ash smudges the air , from an aggravated volcano south of the Rio Grande . In front of me , a flatbed pickup is hauling empty Cokes . The bottles fill with powder . Stopping at Cal 's , I notice the bookmobile parked by his curb . I have n't seen it in weeks . <p> " Thought you 'd sold that clunker , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitching him again . <p> He 's stacking ratty paperbacks : cookbooks , astrology guides , an unauthorized biography of Mamie Eisenhower . " Hm ? " <p> " The bookmobile . " I offer him some Fritos . Sam 's only sells the big bags , and I ca n't ever finish . <p> " Oh . Ray 's learning to drive , " Cal says . " So I been lending him my horsepower here  --  against my better judgment . Boy 's a damn fireball when he scoots behind the wheel . " <p> " How 's his dad ? " <p> " Goner . Ghost . " <p> " Jesus , I 'm sorry to hear it . " <p> Just then Ray himself appears , emerging from a tiny bathroom in the back . " Mr. Palmer ! Good to see you , " he says . <p> " Hey , Ray . You too . " He 's clean-shaven now , looking more than ever like a fine young man . " I was just asking about your pa . " <p> Ray nods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , you know , they 're not sure they got it all .. , the doctors , I mean , the cancer .... " <p> His eyes glisten ; his voice crumples . <p> " Got your car picked out ? " I ask . " Classic Mustang ? Thunderbird ? " <p> But my little evasion is far too clumsy , " Excuse me , " he says , wiping his nose , and scuffles back to the john . <p> " Poor kid , " I say . " And you , too , Cal , I 'm sorry . " <p> " Yeah . Billy 's a damn fighter , but it looks like this is one ol ' bear he 's not going to bust . " <p> " Can I help in any way ? " <p> He tosses Mamie onto a fat Jackie O. " Come to think of it , there is something you can do . Your buddy , Tony what's-his-name , he dropped in the other day looking for the latest Stephen King . Says you fellows got a card game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two . " <p> Ray 's back now , trying to smile , his nose and eyes raw beets . <p> " Billy 's the best damn bluffer you ever saw ... " course , he has n't been able to play . Two of my other cronies moved out of town . Anyways , this shindig of yours . " He slaps a discount tag on M. F. K. Fisher . " Closed shop , or what ? " <p> Before I can answer , Ray chimes in , " Maybe you two should work a deal , Unc . You stock some of Mr. Palmer 's books , he puts a word in for you with his poker pals . " <p> Glory ! I want to kiss the kid . I 'd been wondering how to open my bid . <p> He blows his nose . <p> " Well now . " I scratch my chin . Delivery trucks scurry past on the street . Pizzas , furniture , meat : bless our culture of exchange . " I suppose I could do that . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Ray . " We got us some powwowing to do , kid . About car keys . " " Come on , Unc . I just did you a favor . " <p> " Shit , " Cal says . He looks at me . " When 's your next game ? " <p> " I 'll let you know when I drop the books off . " I tell Ray I 'd be happy to give him a driving lesson some night . <p> " I 'd like that , " he says , reaching for the Fritos . <p> " Save up your card money , George . You 're going to need a barrelful . " <p> " Turkey , George . I ordered turkey , " Ed says . " This is Spam . Or aluminum siding , or something . " <p> On my desk , a scribbled message : " Call Julio Zamora  --  Urgent . " <p> A woman speaking rapid Spanish answers the phone . <p> " I 'm sorry , I ca n't ... can you please slow down ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Zamora can not talk to anyone right now . " <p> " Que paso ? " I ask . <p> In stilted , rolling-r English , the woman explains that Mrs. Zamora came home from the employment agency late this morning and , without a word to her husband , picked up her babies and tossed them into Buffalo Bayou . <p> " Tossed ? " I say . " What do you mean , tossed ? " <p> " Like dolls , sir . Like old newspapers . " <p> Goosebumps spatter my arms . " Was anyone hurt ? " <p> Chatito , ten weeks old , drowned , she says . Roberto is missing . Manuel and the others are in shock . The police handcuffed Mrs. Zamora and drove her away . <p> " What 's up , man ? " Tony watches me from his desk . <p> " Lira Zamora  --  " <p> " Trouble in taco land ? " <p> Close your eyes , I think . Count to ten . " Any calls for me , take a message , OK ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Can you bring me back some turkey ? " <p> At the mouth of the garage , pulling out in my car , I wave at Bob , half-asleep in his concrete security booth . He does n't see me . I speed down Main Street , past Indonesian restaurants and a Pizza Inn . Car exhaust hangs in willows along the median . The Astrodome rises like an old , pallid whale to the south . <p> Julio 's neighbors are talking in tight circles on their lawns : men with long shirttails , sipping canned beer . Children play near the curb . On the horizon , at the end of the street , Houston 's glassed-in banks tower together like slats in a cyclone fence . The bayou boils around fallen oak limbs , curled like big arthritic hands . Five or six cops unroll a strip of yellow tape . " Back . Get back , please . " <p> One of them shouts into a bulky walkie-talkie , " No floater here . Water 's moving pretty fast . We 're gon na need boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gray checkered couch , drunk and in tears . Behind him , two whispering young policemen . I tell them I 'm a friend . They check my driver 's license , phone in my name . Finally they let me sit down . <p> " Julio . " I touch his shoulder . His shirt is limp with sweat . " Julio , what happened ? " <p> Bleary face . " No se .... " <p> " Is Lira all right ? " <p> " I do n't know , I do n't know , George . " <p> " Was she angry ? Was Lira angry about something ? How could this  --  ? " <p> " She was worn out from looking for work . Taking care of the kids . " He spreads his hands . " I do n't know what I could 've done . " <p> " It 's all right . Take your time . " <p> Sunlight bastes the room through the door . <p> " For a while this morning , after she came home , I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , that was the problem , we could n't afford more kids . I got mad and ... " He kicks the table in front of us . I jump . I remember his cloudy face the night he came home and found me talking to Lira . The cops turn , still whispering . " Then she grabbed Chatito and went out the door with him before I knew what was happening . Clutching a rosary in her hand . When she came back without him and picked up Angelina , I knew something was wrong , but she was so strong , man , I could n't believe the power in her arms . I 'd had too many beers . " <p> I notice a tiny wooden crucifix on the wall , above the television , a black Christ nailed to its arms . It 's the first time I 've seen it . The natural color of the wood , in Jesus ' hands and face , matches Julio 's dark-brown complexion . <p> Lira had become " religious " in the last few days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and withdrawn "  --  as the Day of the Dead approached . <p> On the television , next to a candle , four tiny clay tablets . Tierras del Santos : pieces of earth , each stamped with a saint 's grave face . Among certain Latin peoples , I 've learned , these cakes are eaten or dissolved in water to ease menstrual pain . <p> Jesus . " Is Lira pregnant again ? " I ask Julio . He looks at me . " It 's none of my business , man , but there are ways to prevent that . " <p> " We watch the moon . Lira says  --  " He shakes his head . <p> " What about the other kids ? " <p> " The man in the ambulance thinks they 'll be OK . " <p> " Roberto ? " <p> " No se . " He grips my hand . " I do n't know what happened , George . We were a happy family . Lira loved Chatito . She was a good mother to those babies .... " <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pops in my head . My throat aches  --  like I 've thrown back a double shot of whiskey . <p> I glance behind us , at the cops . " Julio , have the police checked your immigration status ? " <p> He stares at me , startled . " I 'm not sure . " <p> " If they ask about it , do n't tell them anything . You 're entitled to a lawyer . Do you understand ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Mr. Zamora ? " A policeman asks Julio to follow him onto the porch . <p> " You have my work number , right ? " I say .

The following afternoon , through hanks of late-season leaves on the bayou 's banks , I watch police boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lanky young men in wetsuits slog through shallows and mud . Onlookers come and go , eating bag lunches , reading paperbacks and newspapers , gossiping . <p> I follow the bend for about two miles , past the site of an old homeless camp , busted up earlier this month . I 'd checked it out , once , for the paper . For nearly six years , laid-off oil workers pitched tents or tarps here , or slept in blown-gasket cars . Their immediate neighbors , poor families like the Thuots and the Zamoras in run-down rental homes , did n't complain about the camp , but folks in outlying areas did . " It 's a transient population , drug-addicted and mentally retarded . We 're talking heroin and cheap booze , " said a woman who lived about a mile away . Penrose had asked me to research the story since I 'd written several obits for men from the camp who 'd died during freezes , or whose bodies were found in the bayou . " They break into houses like mine looking for pawnable items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided against stories on the homeless . " There 's not one positive angle here , " he said . " If we had a case of someone pulling himself up by his bootstraps and getting out of poverty , we might consider running a piece . As it is ... " <p> Weeks later , police ordered the men off the land . Now all that 's left are pads of burned grass where they built their cooking fires . <p> The river is fairly placid here , not far from where the Thuots get their bathwater . Two black boys straddle pine logs on the bank , pitching fishing lines into the current . " Catch anything ? " I ask , brushing aside brambles . <p> " Naw , ai n't nothing worth catching , " says one of the boys . His companion spits into the water . <p> Farther down , ivy snags my feet .

" <p> One beautiful spring afternoon last year , a mounted police officer 's horse-a ten-year-old gelding named Einstein  --  got spooked , apparently by several feet of bright orange mesh in the grass ( did he mistake it for a snake ? ) , slipped into the water , and sank beneath the Capitol Street Bridge . An hour later , his body surfaced and was removed by a heavy-duty dump truck . <p> The city 's most infamous drowning happened nearly twenty years ago . Several cops beat a man named Joe Campos Torres so badly that the booking sergeant refused to accept him into any city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a site near the bayou and whaled on him some more . At that point he either jumped or was pushed into the water . No cop involved spent more than a year in custody . <p> Today I recite these incidents to myself , both to take my mind off Lira and to fit her behavior into some kind of manageable context . But I 'm failing . <p> For once , folklore does n't help me , either . Local historians say the bayou was named for the buffalo gar that regularly navigate its waters . But anecdotes I 've gathered over the years suggest that , somewhere , eighteenth-century Spanish explorers ' maps still exist that denote the " Arroyo de Cibolo " or " Ditch of Bison . " These stories say early Indians drove mammoths over the bayou 's banks to cripple them and make them easy targets for their spears . There 's even supposed to be a Confederate schooner in the water here .

" <p> Through a window I see the shadow of a man inside , moving among jars of tentacles in clear brine , among fishing nets filled with crusty clam shells , swaying from the ceiling . Lemon and oysters , I smell . Another man steps outside in a slick rubber apron covered with pink and yellow fish guts . He 's wiping his hands on a newspaper . Our paper . The Community Section . Through willow trees , trailing their tips in the water , sketching thin , dirty ripples  --  concentric rings  --  come the muted spasms of boat motors circling , circling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no word from Julio Zamora .

" A recent law in Texas makes multiple killings a capital offense , " Scott explained to me . " Tough luck for your friend . Naturally , this assumes the other kid  --  Roberto ?  --  is dead . " For now her location is a well-guarded secret , Scott said . Her Mexican citizenship makes the paperwork messy , so the D.A . ' s office wants her kept under wraps . " All I can tell you is she 's not in the criminal courts building . I 've checked the new facility over on San Jacinto and Baker Streets  --  they do n't call it a jail , they call it an Adult Detention Zone , " Scott said with distaste , " but for all its high-tech alarms , it 's still the same old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place wo n't talk to me .

" Her braces flash . " We ai n't seen hide nor hair of him since . " <p> At the Chinese takeout , the assistant manager , a Taiwanese national , shrugs when I mention Julio 's name . Six or seven women , black and Asian , sit at a table in the kitchen peeling shrimp , sweeping the shells onto scattered newspapers on the floor . <p> " Lavonda say she gettin ' the house and the car , " chirps one , a tall woman with short hair in tangled sprouts , tossing wedges of orange meat into a boiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind and deaf .

An odor of Lysol and peppers swarms the room . <p> I order some kung pao chicken . On the way home , I stop at the Kroger 's on Montrose for a six-pack of beer . At the pharmacy , in the rear of the store , next to the frozen fish , two pale , thin men wait in line , thumbing through This Week in Texas . " William tells me AZT is cheaper now over at Walgreen 's , " one says softly . <p> " Sweet William . How are his platelets ? " <p> " Pathetic .

Apartment for Rent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I realize that for a year now , while I 've walked in the fog of my grief , a whole community has dwindled around me . <p> I see a young man pull a yellowed shade in a cracked apartment window . <p> Tonight , Sno King clatters like a riot . I take a beer and my chicken to the far end of my garage , where sometimes it 's quieter than in the house . I discovered this after a late-night fight with Jean . Simmering , I 'd grabbed a sleeping bag and a pillow and marched outside . I hung a mirror on a nail and filled a large tin tub with water so I could shave the following morning . A cricket , limp as a penis , wound up floating there , on an island of Foamy . Spiders rappelled down rolls of insulation next to a greasy workbench ; roaches skittered over wrenches , screwdrivers , drills . But I slept better than Jean did that night . Somehow  --  an acoustic quirk  --  Sno King 's turmoil was muffled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now , what the fight was about , though it could only have been one thing . I do n't remember ever tussling over anything else . <p> Thwack ! Thwack ! <p> " You win , sweetheart . " I raise my bottle in the dark . <p> 11 . I 'd been thinking about it all day , and I 'd decided Freedmen 's Town was the place to take Ray for his driving lesson : a mostly black neighborhood northeast of Montrose , not far from Magnolia Blossom Cemetery . The streets there are narrow , but traffic is usually light . <p> Like the Shamrock , Freedmen 's Town offers me a vicarious sense of home , though often my white skin draws curious  --  sometimes hostile  --  stares from the porch-sitters . I never worry , though . I 'm not sure why . Maybe because so many cheerful mothers live in the area . I see them watching their kids in the yards and laughing with each other , big , solid anchors of safety . <p> Like Bob , they probably could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... <p> The Town  --  an area of a few blocks , really  --  was founded by ex-slaves shortly after the Civil War . It used to have its own filling stations , dry-goods stores , and nightclubs , but now it 's a cluster of dilapidated rental homes threatened by bulldozers and high-flying redevelopment . Here and there , though , samples of its old brick streets bleed through the asphalt , and I feel connected to the ground , to the past , to some kind of constancy ( though I know the place is changing ) , in a way I ca n't experience anywhere else in the city . <p> Sort of like Jean and her apple trees . <p> A perfect spot for misfits and ghosts . <p> " Take a left here , " I tell Ray now . " Watch this comer ; it 's a sharp one . OK , when you hit the brake , do n't stomp  --  pump it a little , gently , that 's it . " <p> We pass a dusty brick building in a field of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis , the Confederate president . It 's been closed for years . Jagged glass teeth are all that remain of its windows . Past an Asian grocery and rows of wooden houses . A handlettered sign droops on a dead yellow lawn . " Big Bad Dog . " Hip-hop shouts from open windows . Someone shatters a porchlight with a rock ; thick laughter cartwheels down the block . In the near distance , downtown Houston glimmers , peach and amber . A sumpy sulfur smell rises from tall , moist grass and from foggy mudholes exposed to the sky . <p> " Stay off the shoulder . There 's some broken glass up here . That 's it , you 're doing fine . " <p> " It runs real smooth , " Ray says . " Unc 's bookmobile is a little hard to handle . No power steering . " <p> " Guess you 'll have to get a sleek new sports car , then , if you 're going to impress the girls . " He grins . <p> " You want to try parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in over there , where it says Mount Carmel Baptist Church . " <p> I catch a whiff of pork chops and fried okra . Ray whips the car into a wide slot between faded yellow lines and jerks us to a stop . <p> " Sorry , " he says . <p> " Remember , pump the brakes . " <p> We sit with the windows down . In vacant lots west of the church , crickets creak like old wooden doors . <p> " Where are we ? " Ray asks . <p> " The Fourth Ward . Freedmen 's Town . " <p> " Looks like it 's seen its better days . " <p> " Yeah . It used to be the heart and soul of black Houston , " I say . " Then the city ran a freeway through here and chopped it all up . " <p> Ray wipes his eyes . <p> " Hey . What is it , Ray ? " <p> " I 'm sorry , Mr. Palmer , I 'm just  --  " <p> " You did great . Really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " he says . " It 's not that .

It 's the first time someone close to me has been real sick , the first time I 've had to think about someone I love maybe dying . It scares the hell out of me . " <p> " I know . " <p> " But it 's more than just my dad . I mean , sometimes lately , I feel sorry for myself because I 'm going to kick off someday , too . I knew that , of course , but ...

His foot taps the floor , by the brake . <p> " Hell , you know this . " What would a good father tell him ? " I have n't figured it out , myself . " <p> He looks at me , poised , handsome  --  too young to feel this bad . <p> Watching his leg , I feel for a moment my own foot , again , slamming down hard  --  the sickening slide , the smoke of rubber , the glance into the rearview , and Jean 's anxious eyes  --  <p> " Well . What do you say ? Another spin around the block ? " <p> " No thanks , Mr. Palmer . " He rubs his cheeks . " I think that 's enough for tonight . " <p> Absolutely . " All right . You 're going to be a fine driver , Ray . " <p> " Thanks . Thanks for your help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . <p> 12 . Once a week , now , I still meet the Thuots . Their oldest son , Kim  --  sixteen , and with a good command of English  --  turned in one of the job applications I 'd brought one day , and earned a cashiering spot at a Circle K convenience store . Last Wednesday the Thuots spent his first check on roast duck and rice , and invited me to dinner . I toasted them all with a bottle of cheap Italian wine I 'd bought . In Tuscan folklore , I told them , water 's linked to filth ( pissing ) , while alcohol fa buon sangue : makes for good blood . They liked that . I brought shrimp from Water Under the Bridge . " And , " I said , " you won the raffle at Cal 's Bookstore . " <p> " The what ? " asked Mrs. Thuot . <p> " The raffle . Free gifts . " <p> " My goodness . How ? " <p> " I filled out the entry form for you . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given me to deliver . Cal was furious . He 'd hoped a regular customer would be hooked into spending hundreds of dollars in the store . Worried about his competition  --  the encroaching chain stores  --  he was n't in the mood to let the Thuots come in and choose their own prizes . " What do they care ? Do they even read ? Just give them these . " <p> Now Mr. Thuot stared , confused , at a deck-repair manual , a shipbuilder 's guide , The Bra Book , and Mamie Eisenhower . <p> The family unpacked its gongs . We rang them several times to celebrate Kim 's good fortune . I gave him six free passes to the Shamrock . <p> " The children , " said Mr. Thuot . " May their skies be high , yes ? " <p> We filled our cups to the brim . <p> Tonight , birthday candles in paper-lantern shells float down the bayou at dusk : a Festival of Lights commemorating several events  --  " The Bayou Beckons , " the city calls it , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Independence Day , and a remembrance of families who died in Hiroshima ( each flickering flame in the mist a token of loss ) . <p> Flowers and wooden crosses mark Chatito 's drowning , Roberto 's disappearance . <p> Mariachi music echoes in the trees . Fireworks break like eggs against the sky . Gritos  --  shouts of independence  --  carry on the hot breeze . Elsewhere , Asian priests ask children to send their thoughts to heaven , to those who once wore cloaks of fire . <p> A young Japanese couple cuddles in the grass . The woman is pregnant . Watching them , I remember an old Ashanti folktale . In the beginning women bore no children . One day a python asked a man and woman who came to bathe in his river if they had any offspring . " No , " they replied unhappily . " Bring your friends to my woods , " the python instructed them . " I 'll make the women conceive . " The couple did as they were told . When the people had gathered , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toe . " He slithered into the river and drew a mouthful of water . Then he sprayed the water on the bellies of all the men and women and told them to lie together that night in warm leaf-beds on the ground . In nine months the women bore children . The world knew birth and desire . <p> I scramble down a steep , dusty bank to a spot that 's deserted for now . Coors cans rust in the mud . Condoms . Cigarette butts . The lapping and sucking of water meeting land . Separate worlds . I toss a stone into the river . It makes a sound like a voice almost decipherable to me , from a realm beyond my own . Another stone , another voice . Then another and another . Pretty soon I 've started a whole conversation . A boisterous family . <p> I confess : hauntings are a weakness of mine . <p> Jean . Now Lira . Chatito and Roberto . <p> " Where are you ? " I whisper . Reeds rattle like maracas . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year , in one of our earliest interviews together , " but I pray to God each night that they 'll leave us the hell alone . " <p> Now a lump of moss , dark-green and blue , as long as a woman 's gown , wraps a broken limb in the stream . Every American city claims some version of the " disappearing woman . " It 's a very common folktale . <p> A beautiful hitchhiker in a satin dress , pacing the shore of a lake . A disheveled young girl near a river , needing help . <p> Wet dreams . <p> Pick her up , and she 'll give you her address . On the way home she fades , leaving only a trace of moisture in your car . When you reach her street , you find the ruins of a stately mansion where people died long ago . Or you find nothing at all . <p> South Ruthven Street is deserted this late at night . Quiet .

" <p> Some flying creature  --  a misguided bird , a bat  --  flitters in the trees . <p> Greasy paper plates have been blown against the stones . Napkins , cups . The Day of the Dead . I 've missed it . Families must have been here , sharing meals with their lost ones . A candle in a cracked glass container , painted with the Virgin of Guadalupe , tilts on a circle of fresh dirt next to three or four paper-wrapped roses and a handful of sizzling yellow marigolds . <p> I say hello to my mother , stored neatly here like a small , brittle ornament . <p> Twigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Touch my cheek .

Scott says he was apprehended yesterday along with a family named Munoz , with whom he 'd been hiding in a house somewhere in the Fifth Ward . The cops caught him trying to break into his old place and cart off the washer and dryer  --  the only things he really owned . I have n't been able to speak to him or the kids  --  I miss , most , my little webslinger  --  and may not get a chance to see them before they leave .
