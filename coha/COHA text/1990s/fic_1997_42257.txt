Some history they did n't teach you in schoolbut it explains a lot ! <p> You just ca n't tell about History . I mean , things are changing so fast , it sometimes feels like the very past itself is not as solid as it used to be . At least that 's the take where I am . Or is that when I am ? The terminology is n't too precise . And here at AT &T; ( at least before it got broken up into a bunch of smaller , almost incoherent organizations ) , we engineers and scientists used to pride ourselves on lucid , accurate , precise , and correct terminology and language . However you say it though , one thing is clear to me : nothing is what it seems to be to all of you who work outside The Phone Company . History , least of all . Let me try to make that a little clearer . Have you ever had the feeling , during the last ten or fifteen years , that history just was not happening like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's bad guys just sort of gave up and went away without a fight ? How so many kinds of weird people and unusual ideas and outrageous political movements have sprung up , have even won elections ? How even the historians ca n't seem to agree on history any more , and how we argue about even our memories of recent events ? I 've got news for you : history has n't been what it should have been . It is n't even staying the same . And , my friends , that is truly scary . I first experienced It over thirty years ago , when I got into Bell Labs , and by deep thought and worthy deed and sincere action convinced The Powers That Ought To Be how I was fit to be one of them ( or at least on their team ) , and thus finally got my soul-grabbing alphabet soup of clearances . I accepted It with all my other duties , and took some pride in the fact that we in The Phone Company had undertaken such a cosmic task . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE Sixties , " they did n't arrive until about " 65 or so ) , and way back then we did as we were told . Well , more or less . Anyway , I did n't know the rest of the world knew anything about It until I happened to be at a drunken party at the 1985 World Sci-Fi Convention in Auckland Down Under . The room was jammed with sci-fi writers of all kinds , and as a guy fairly new to the field , I was kind of hanging out at the periphery , hoping my party trajectory would take me into an orbit that led ultimately to intersect with a Hugo winner somewhere , preferably a hard science type like Jerry or Larry or Charles or Greg or Hal or David or Poul . While I mused so , a tall , dark , and hairy author sidled up to me and whispered , " Where were you when the world changed , Arlan ? " I gulped involuntarily and he stared down at me as if I Knew Of course , I Did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as innocently as I could , fighting down the urge to panic , " when Apollo landed ? " He shook his head . " No , not that . When Things Changed . " I could hear the Capital Letters , he was that good . His voice lowered even further , and I practically had to stand on tiptoes to catch his speech , even though I did n't really want to hear him say it . He was not a Company Man , after all . " I mean , Arlan , when all these alternate universes , alternate histories , started becoming our reality ? " Damn it , he Knew ! Inwardly I groaned ; this would mean stacks of reports to be filled out , and assessments of situations , and loads of other paperwork I did n't want to think about during the Sci-Fi Con . " Eric , I do n't know what you mean . You 're talking about the new markets in sci-fi novels , the alternate-history ones you 've started doing ? " Shaking his head , Eric snorted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking-room section of the Sci-Fi professionals " party , where a heated debate was in progress . He shoved and squeezed , manipulating me into the heated core of the ongoing belligerence , and I found myself sitting cross-legged on the floor in front of a bedful of various famous , and nearly so , sci-fi writers . One of them was obviously tipsy as well as loud , but fascinating for all that . " Hellfire , I can tell you when It All Changed-when Hinckley 's bullets missed Ron Reagan , right there in front of the Hinckley Hilton , downtown D.C. In the real world , George Bush became president in 19 and 81 and we did n't get this godawful arms buildup and the trillion-dollar Star Wars program that 's going to destroy the economy and the world . " Interesting thought , I thought , but way off base . Behind me a challenging voice chirped up , " No , in the real world , Lennon shoots Reagan . US declares war on Colombia . " " Colombia ? " somebody asked . " Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes him do it ! " The whole room roared in hilarity , marking the high point in the conversation , after which time the roomful of brilliant , creative , and weird minds latched onto other emerging subjects and the theory of How Things Had Changed evaporated into the stultifying mixture of smoke and air and body odor . I uncrossed my legs and motioned Eric to meet me outside , on the patio past the sliding glass doors . Outside , he picked up the conversation . " Arlan , there you go . They know it , too . We 've all of us sensed that things have changed . Trouble is , we just ca n't pinpoint exactly when . " I started to speak , but Eric held up a palm . " No , hear me out , really . I think we in the sci-fi field are just more attuned to alternate history , and I 'll be damned if I do n't think you and I and the rest of us " - he gestured toward the laughing crowd back inside the room- " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history or other weird timeline . " I breathed deeply , controlling my initial fears . He does n't Know . He 's only speculating . I took comfort in that thought , but a more disturbing one took its place . But he does feel it , they all do inside there . I shrugged mentally . I ca n't tell them , but they ought to feel lucky to be tn one of the Seven Known Alternities . What godawful things might be happening in all the rest of the Infinitude ? Let me interrupt here to tell you The Story : How Things Were , How Things Got Cross-Wired ( Literally ) , and How Things Came Apart . And ultimately , how that has to do with What We ( Used To ) Do At The Phone Company . Time:July 1964 . Scene : Bell Telephone Laboratories , Murray Hill , New Jersey . A secret chamber , half a mile below the surface , bright fluorescent lighting , walls daubed a dull light green . At the head of a class a lecturer speaks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , successfully completed all the intensive coursework , endured the extensive barrage of testing , and secured your comprehensive security clearances . " The neatly dressed preppie scientist-all dark suit , white Oxford-cloth shirt , shiny thin tie , and blond crew cut-smiled at his little wordplay and several of my class of ten new recruits nodded and returned the smile . I did n't ; I felt like we were on the verge of some spectacular revelation and I leaned forward to catch every word . " You have taken all the courses , you have understood the growth of the Bell System , all the way from Dr. Bell and Mr. Watson , through Mr. Vail , through the step-by-step Strowger switch up to today 's Electronic Switching System , the ESS Series that we are this very day installing for the first time . " Does anyone know why we have spent billions and billions of dollars to replace perfectly good seventy-yearold technology , switches that have operated almost failure-free since they were invented by that undertaker who wanted to ensure that no human operator would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone line ? " " To make more efficient the U. S. of A. phone system , " one greenhorn volunteered . An Indian . From India . " To make more money . " " To get calls through faster . " " To service the customers . " At each of these rapid-fire answers from the audience , the lecturer smiled and shook his head , pointing at yet another raised hand " You 're all correct , " he finally said , pacing up and down in front of the lectern , " those are good reasons , and each of them will happen . But , " he spun on his heel , splaying all ten fingers at us , " each of you is also Wrong . The real reason has to do with our vast wired network , the millions upon millions of interconnections we have made , the untold quadrillions and quintillions and octillions of possible interconnections among these customers that are possible . " His voice now a whisper , the lecturer turned and pressed a large red pushbutton on the wall behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough surfaced rear-projection screen . " I am now ready-you are now ready-to understand the whole truth behind The Phone Company . Why it must remain one unitary system , at least in the U. S. of A. , why we must maintain our interconnected network as the world 's leader . The rest of the world , backwards as they are , they 'll never catch up . And for us , that 's good . They wo n't get the Alter nities goodies like we do . " The class , me included , gasped as the rear-projection screen suddenly filled with the five words that changed our lives : There Are Seven Parallel Universes . The lecturer smiled at our gasping reactions . " How can there be ? " the Harvard man said , standing and pointing to make his point . " Simple , " came the answer , " the Many-Worlds Theory of Quantum Mechanics allows an uncountably infinite number of parallel universes , each stemming from tiny decisions in a mother world . Next question . " " How do we know this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nerdish but shapely and attractive woman with the unlikely last name of Borg . The rear-projection screen faded its stunning revelation , replacing it with an image of thousands of overhead wires in 1890s New York . " Around the turn of the century , " the explanation came , " The Phone Company started getting complaints about unknown crosstalk-voices that should n't have been there-especially in New York . Close investigation by the Western Electric research team revealed that the strange voices were not coming from our subscribers , but from elsewhere . Where " elsewhere " was , they could n't tell . " But the situation grew more serious as we jammed more and more wires into a given city . Those early pioneers tried filters , everything , to cut down on the unwanted noise . It was only when they set up an experimental lab and talked to some of those other voices that we finally understood what was happening , that we were able to establish two-way communications with other alternate worlds , worlds of different histories . " We were spellbound , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can you imagine what happened when Dr. Alexander Graham Bell , US citizen from Scotland , found himself speaking with Dr. Ing . Aleandre Lighthorse du Belle , citizen of the Confederate States of North America ? " We all sat gaping , stunned but not disbelieving . The wildest stories of science fiction were true ! Yet there was more to come . " But it was only when Bell Labs got into the picture in the 1920s that they found out bow it was all happeningthe real reason that there ever was a Bell Labs in the first place , you may have guessed . And the secret was , the enormous number of interconnections , the huge number of miles of bare wire all interconnected and switched together , somehow induced connections between our universe and several of the closest parallel universes . " The lecturer shrugged . " Again , this has something to do with the eigenvalue solutions of the Wave Equation , they say . Beyond that , you get into spinos and I ca n't answer anything . I just know that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster and better than ever before . " " Why only seven ? " Borg asked . " We surmise that only six alternate universes have been sufficiently wired up , like we are , to allow the parallel universe induction to occur . " Harvard man , still standing , turned to lecture the rest of us . " So , either those are the only six , or only six of an infinite number of parallel universes . Either of those possibilities is staggering . What a concept ! " The rest of that day was a wonder . We learned that all of the parallel-Universe analogs of The Phone Company had cooperated to share information among themselves . We got the deForest triode amplifier , we gave the Strowger switch ; we got a rather primitive version of solid-state physics ; we traded them Claude Shannon 's work on information theory . And on and on , up through masers and lasers and aerogels and virtual reality , a profitable collusion of seven cornucopias with secret knowledge . Based on the benefits of this arrangement , The Phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monopoly in this country ; to break up such a scheme would have cost us immensely . And , to hedge against our foreign cousins finding such a treasure house , we sent secret emissaries abroad to ensure that no other country would ever be so wired as to access the alternate worlds . In the British Isles , for example , we made sure that the venerable Post Office would run their system . In all the other monarchies , we were able to whisper about the threat to security that unfettered telephony among the peasants might pose . After many years , only tiny Finland was able to construct any system comparable to ours . Fortunately for us , this little country never met the minimum parallel world induction requirements , and so no other nation ever found out about It-until . . . For most of this century , The Phone Company had It made , and the rest of the country along with us . But sure enough , somewhere along the line , we got too complacent and someone else caught on . We figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his entourage went to Japan in the late 1940s to teach the defeated enemy how to manage quality in their reborn factories , teaching them all about Bell Labs " statistics . Some smart Japanese must have figured out our secret , because in the late " 40s they began wiring up Japan every bit as heavily as we had wired the US . " OK , so they 're coming aboard , so what ? " was the general line taken at our New York HQ . " Maybe we can learn something from parallel-Japans as well . " But those wise guys had learned our whole game , not just the technical side : they began to lobby inside our government to break our wired system apart , to make us fall below the parallel-worlds induction level . And they did , and it worked ; we in The Phone Company had failed to continue to convince the powers-thatwere of the benefits of our system . Personally , I do n't think some of them in Washington ever even believed we talked to other worlds . To make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened : on Jani ary 1 , 1983 , as required by law , the Bell System was divided into seven smaller " Baby Bells . " I was in a regional switching control office , watching the huge display screens as the long lines were physically separated at the switches . To my sorrow , as region after region of the US went dark , I could see the connections to the parallel worlds winking off , dissipating . Within minutes , all connections to the goodies and freebies of six other Alternate Phone Companies were severed , and for the first time in over eighty years , we at AT &T; were Alone . There is no need to detail the enormous personal sacrifice we all felt , especially those 20,000 persons who had lived their lives to maintain the nodal points where inter-universe communications had been taking place . They were , of course , laid off . No one ever revealed The Secret because they would n't have been believed , and jobs were scarce , and each one needed a good reference to find new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story , at least the obvious parts . The Pacific Rim countries wired them selves up , pell-mell , putting in communications capacity they would never need , all in hopes of accessing the treasures of the parallel worlds . And by the mid- ' 80s , it became apparent they had made induction work : the enormous number of innovations in consumer products , in electronics , in just about every field , crushing our homegrown companies , causing unemployment and misery all over our land . Oh , in a few places where we had supercomputers and the alternate universes had them in the same place , we maintained a minimal set of contacts , so that places like Los Alamos and Sandia and NASA occasionally got the rare jewel of research information . But nothing really useful to society at large . This is , of course , the obvious part , something everyone could figure out , given the true picture of parallel worlds . But there were non-obvious , nonpublic consequences as well , things that we at AT &T; did n't find out till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the newly independent Baby Bells went hell-bent for induction , each on their own , and were already prepared , secretly , at the cut-over date , . to maintain their own parallel induction capabilities . They did n't miss a lick , although there were problems . Trouble was , rather than having one large , coherent system , the induction was locally strong in some places , weak in others . Result was , some Baby Bells could access some of the usual six parallel worlds , but because of massive concentrations in some cities , other Baby Bells started picking up many more parallel universe systems . Some of those new worlds were really weird , I found out later . The information anybody over here got was sporadic , sometimes nonsensical ( ESP machines ? Inertialess drives ? Video games ? ) Some worlds had their inductive wiring systems jammed up in one or two regions ; there 's an Etowah Nation that talks in Cherokee to what used to be BellSouth ; a Republic of Fremont in the Bay Area only ; an Arabicspeaking parallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which turns out to be a real mess . All of that occurred real quick-like on January 1 , 1983-the Real Day Everything Changed , when the alternate worlds began to get out of synch . There were bigger problems to come , though , much bigger . We had the seven Baby Bells wiring up to beat the band , and the Pacific Rimmers doing the same . You add to that the gargantuan increase in wiring our cable TV systems in particular , and by the late " 80s we were getting much too coupled to those other worlds . Sometime in that period , the past itself began to waver . Since Bell Labs had been mostly broken up into ineffectual consumer-product groups , and since nobody else cared too much about nationwide telephone network research , there has n't been anybody to study the problem , but the last I heard was this : because of the scattered concentrations of wiring interconnections , some kind of balance among the parallel worlds was upset . Things got chaotic ; result was , the past of World One ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another world , and they all got mixed up , fairly randomly . We at AT &T; began tracking the manifestations-people who swore they 'd read that one famous person or another had died , but then found out it had n't happened . Things once lost turning up where they been searched for before , and vice versa . Anomalous artifacts in archaeology , weird lights in the sky , strange cults and sects , independent Presidential candidates , the whole works . And worst of all , a vague feeling permeating society that Something Had Changed . We at AT &T; grew horrified-sup pose last month 's long-distance calling charges got shifted to another world as well ? What if our past got shifted into some world with higher taxes ? An accountant 's nightmare ! We could n't have all our remaining investments at risk . So we got together with the other long-distance carriers and in unison we attacked the problem on all fronts , even got the Feds and all of their Labs involved . Suddenly , networking studies , neural nets , Al , became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypotheses , with possible solutions . What we found was , with the profusion of more and more electronic products , with more and more PCs and laptops , the problem is just getting worse . Pockets of past-shifting are occurring randomly all over the world ; business records , investment accounts , even genealogies are no longer solid . Historical " revisionism " is rampant , as different sets of scholars write on things they actually researched and remember , from sources that once were valid . Politics have changed so sharply that forty-year trends have reversed themselves ; one election the people want big government , the next , a smaller one ; and the most incredible politicians , ones who would ve been jailed in previous years , get themselves elected over and over again . ( Well , when the past changes , memories get confused and the populace responds accordinglyunpredictably . ) Actually , there is one solution to this situation , and all of us Phone Companies decided to do it a few years back , but it 's rather scary , too . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Know , we have been going full-bore to wire the whole world up in one unified network , to grow the Internet-with its information-rich video and sound version , the World Wide Web-so wide and far and fast that we will quickly warp our whole planet into one unified , stable history line , presumably a consensus past acceptable to most of us . The uncertainty is unnerving , but at least we 're better off than some worlds , at least we have a chance to stabilize our own past . And we Phone Companies here in World One are pushing as hard as possible , before another alternate world steals our history . Because as bad as our known history is , we could have done worse . In some of those unfortunate other worlds , various incarnations of Monopoly still reign : weird things called a World Soviet Union , a Unified World State , a Corporate Continuum , an Axis Hegemony , and Le Monarchie du Monde de Napoleon XII . And-in one particularly pernicious parallel universe , their version of the US government is even trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications chips , a secret way into the network so that Big Brother can subtly intervene electronically whenever it senses a threat to itself , and prevent its Phone Companies from stabilizing their world 's past . From that regime 's horribly perverse viewpoint , a changing past is preferable to an unknown past that might kick them out of power . Of course , you might expect such shenanigans from a world in which the US re-elects as a President some oversexed Yuppie yahoo . Thank the Eight Hundred Gods that in our own enlightened world , the Co-Regents are both ex-sci-fi writers who understand these kinds of things and are letting your Phone Companies , like us here at Alternate Telecoms &; Telechron , try to nail down the past once and for all . You just ca n't be too careful about History !
