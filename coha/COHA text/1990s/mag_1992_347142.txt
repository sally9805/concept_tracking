Neurologists and psychologists learned long ago that brain injuries can be a powerful tool for investigating how human thought and memory are organized . A case study by two Johns Hopkins researchers , reported in Nature , is but the latest example . A 70-year-old retired librarian who suffered such an injury developed a remarkable symptom : she lost the ability to name animals , though % she could still name other living things , such as plants , and inanimate objects . Nor could she assign physical attributes to animals  --  she could not , for example , answer the question " What color is an elephant ? " Yet she could answer nonphysical questions , about whether a given animal lived on land or in the sea , or whether it was normally kept as a pet . And when shown a picture of , say , a lion with a horse 's head , she could tell right away that the two did n't match . <P> So what does it mean ? Evidently , the brain has distinct systems for classifying different types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as physical versus nonphysical characteristics , in different ways . Moreover , the study shows that the brain has two classification systems , one language based and one sight based , and that one can be destroyed while the other stays intact .
