There 's a new natural law in the universe , as undeniable as gravity : Steffi Graf can not be stopped . Life has done everything to put her through hell  --  thrown her father in jail , put her through debilitating surgeries , brought back Monica Seles  --  but she has beaten all of it back like so many small balls . She has reached a point defying all athletic logic . Players now fear taking a lead over her because that just means , as Lindsay Davenport says , " Oh , no , you 've made her mad . " Last Thursday in Key Biscayne , Fla. , as the announcer boomed out Graf 's monotonously brilliant record over stadium court at the Lipton Championships , coach Marcel Freeman paused on a nearby practice court , looked at his pupil , Chanda Rubin , and said in exasperation , " Listen to that . She 's lost , like , two matches in seven years . You 've got to take her out  --  just on general principle . " // Freeman was n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been so afflicted by galloping melodrama the past few years , so consumed by comebacks and flameouts , that Rubin 's recent blossoming has been welcomed with a fervor usually reserved for the newest Nike ad . Seles aside , Rubin was , for tennis junkies , the talk of the 1996 Australian Open , where her huge forehand , her three-set loss to Seles in the semis and her penchant for winning marathon matches set the hype machine running at a low hum . It did n't hurt , either , that Rubin possesses that rare tennis triple : She is black , American and extraordinarily self-assured . " I can play with anybody , " Rubin says . " Including her . " // Not yet . Since fighting off three match points in a breakthrough win over Jana Novotna in the third round of last year 's French Open , the 20-year-old Rubin has shown she can handle the big names on tour  --  except Graf , to whom she has lost all four times they have played . In last Saturday 's final , the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's slice backhand , blasted a slew of unforced errors and wilted in the heat 6-1 , 6-3 . Rubin is now ranked a career-high No. 7 in the world , but Graf showed her the sizable gap that remains between there and the top . " With someone like Arantxa S ? nchez Vicario or Monica , there 's just not quite the same oppressiveness as Graf , " Rubin says . // Oppressive might be the word to describe the burdens heaped on Graf last year . She trudged through the summer and fall carrying a weight so heavy it seemed to be crushing her . While she was off winning the French Open , Wimbledon and the U.S. Open , the German government investigated and then arrested her father , Peter , who had managed her finances throughout her career , for failing to pay millions in income taxes . The lasting image of her triumphant U.S. Open run was not of her on the court after her classic win in the final over Seles but of her frantic , sobbing race out of the interview room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight tournament victory of the year with a visible joy . She is now , oddly enough , playing the happiest tennis of her life . // " I appreciate tennis now more than any other time , " Graf says . " I feel a lot looser because I 'm here . Nothing else touches me right now  --  no phone calls , no faxes . I really appreciate these past few weeks because I know how it was at home . " // In December , Graf went back to Germany to take control of her finances for the first time . In a strange twist , she met with tennis impresario Ion Tiriac , who  --  as a result of a disagreement with Peter over Steffi 's appearance fee for a tournament Tiriac runs in Essen , Germany  --  had provided the information that prompted the government probe of Graf 's finances . Although Graf remains a client of Advantage International , she does not deny she is considering a change , and she could well end up being managed by Tiriac . Graf admits she does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have my father to keep me away from all that , honestly , " Graf says . She never knew how much of a strain it would be to understand her own affairs . " I tried too hard . I was hoping that the more energy I put into it , the better things would go . But then you realize : It does n't change anything . At the end of my stay I could n't sleep anymore . I was worn down so badly . " // Tennis freed her . When Graf returned to her home in Boca Raton , Fla. , in February , she could n't wait to hit the court . " If you have to deal with these things , you realize what a great life you have on tour , you know how great it is just to focus on tennis , " Graf says . " That 's something I 've not treasured as much as I do now . " // She 's not the only one . The 1996 Lipton also proved a milestone for **33;39;TOOLONG Jennifer Capriati @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best performance of her incipient comeback , and also left behind her muddled teenage years , turning 20 last Friday . Lipton marked Capriati 's first appearance in South Florida since her arrest for marijuana possession in a Coral Gables motel room two years ago , and she showed up looking fit and seemingly prepared to stick with the sport . " I never thought I was just completely done with tennis , " Capriati says . " I just knew that it was inside me and it is what I do best . " // Graf had a hand in that realization during the past few months  --  hitting with Capriati , inviting her over for a barbecue , gently encouraging her return . " She 's so natural , so young , and she 's a little bit naive  --  like I see in me a little bit , " Graf says . " And I know she is capable of great things . Tennis will help her . Tennis teaches you so much . It does prepare you for life . " // But it also can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows all too well . She has lost two years of what was once a superstar career , and she presented a warily hopeful face at Lipton . During that time her parents , Stefano and Denise , divorced . They were both on hand , and cordial , during Jennifer 's postmatch gatherings , but the whole family now bears the aura of survivors . " I 'm very grateful , " Denise says . " Just to see her content , happy inside , is the most important thing . " // Rubin , only 40 days older than Capriati , seems to have risen in the ranks with that inner contentment intact . She was raised in a household in Lafayette , La. , that stressed education as much as tennis  --  her mother is a retired schoolteacher , her father a district judge  --  and even now her parents do not travel regularly to her tournaments . The family is n't defined by the game ; four years ago , during her father 's election campaign , Chanda , her brother and her sister spent a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's U.S. Open she 'll campaign again , for her father 's reelection . " I 've learned so much from her , " says Freeman , 36 , who played the men 's tour for seven years . " She 's so poised , so grounded , more than most people my age , that I almost resent her for it . " // The ground under Graf is shakier . She plans to return to Germany for a visit sometime in the next week , and those close to her have said she is not expected to be a target of the ongoing financial investigation . " I 'm not hesitant to go back , " she says . " After having had a great couple of weeks away , I have the right attitude to approach it now . " Her father has been in jail for eight months , during which time Graf has been allowed to see him only occasionally , with a guard standing by . Graf has little hope that he will be released soon . " No , " she says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time , no use , for deciding whom to blame for her father 's plight . " I ca n't judge it , " Graf says . " I do n't want to judge it . I do n't want to judge it , because it is too difficult . " Better to concentrate on her forehand , her slice , her serve  --  so easy to understand and as dependable as daylight .
