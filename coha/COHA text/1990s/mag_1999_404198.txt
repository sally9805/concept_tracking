This rural Virginia community was once known as Sorry Surry for the sad state of its public schools . But since Blacks began turning out for elections and school-board meetings and volunteering with students , test scores have risen , the number of college-bound graduates has more than tripled , and Surry is sorry no more By Katfi Gray Photograph // HER BODY QUIVERING JUST slightly with nervousness , Chaquita Claiborne steps from among the uniformed members of the award-winning Cougar marching band . She pivots to face a room brimming with folks assembled to hear which victories the Surry High School musicians , flag girls , majorettes and drum majors have snagged in several recent contests . Planting her feet to stay steady , Chaquita clears her throat twice , stifles a grin and , in a voice thick with the cadence of this country snatch of V'inia that birthed her , she delivers a halting schoolgirl 's pitch . " Um-uhm-parents , community and friends . There are needs we have . Such as our uniforms , our flags . This tar here , dry-cleaning will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them . However , these defects do not cause us not to be able to carry on . But-we have had these uniforms for six years . We are asking that , we are hoping that , we are asking that-um-uhm-well , we 're asking if you could consider us in the budget next year . " The roomful of adults applauds . Someone throws out an amen . " We 're small but we have a big heart , " says a beaming Alvin Wilson , II , director of the band ( which has a single White member ) . And , at least in the last few years , this school district has developed a resolve large enough to produce not just an award-winning band but a community spirit that has catapulted Surry from the very bottom of Virginia 's academic heap . Today , on state exams , the 1,300-student , threeschool district ranks above roughly half of all the state 's districts on standardized exams . Roy Lane , a security guard , is one of four Blacks on the five-member school board saluting Chaquita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the band 's request . Like so many seated in the cafeteria for the board 's regular meeting-parents , teachers and administrators alike-he was born and reared here . He and his wife , high-school sweethearts , have educated their three children in the public schools in Surry County , an expanse of cotton , soybean , corn and peanut fields in Virginia 's Tidewater region . Lane has vivid recollections of when Surry 's needs extended far beyond natty band uniforms . " I can remember slipping in raw sewage , " Lane says of the high-school field where he practiced baseball in the late 1960 's , the D tumble of words falling matter-of-factly from his lips . Lane 's memory is a metaphor for much of what was wrong with Surry 's public schools following so-called desegregation and White flight . " They were a mess , " he says . " Most of our teachers were n't certified . I got my high-school diploma but remember sitting in math class my first day of junior college and hearing the instructor say , " I will present this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It was supposed to be a review . But it was Greek to me . " Photograph A veteran teacher at L.P Jackson Middle School displays a news account of Surry County 's ascent from the bottom of Virginia 's public-school heap . // Hell-bent on giving their children a better educational start than they had had , Lane and his wife traded Surry in the 1970 's for a neighboring community whose schools , they were convinced , were better . In 1982 , though , the couple returned home with two children in tow ( a third was born in 1983 ) and hopes high . By then , the district once derided as Sorry Surry by its own constituents had begun a dramatic rise from its long-held spot at rock-bottom among Vxrginia 's schools . Blacks account for 68 percent of Surry 's student enrollment today and for approximately 55 percent of Surry 's residents . Since Black citizens wrested control of education from a White minority that had already swapped desegregated public schools for an all-White private academy , the number of Surry students heading to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The turnaround was largely driven by Black parents weary of being political outsiders in a predominantly Black county Today they not only send their kids to the schools they pay for , like most parents , but they also dominate the county commission , which allots educational funding , and the school board , which decides how to spend the dollars in the classroom . It Takes a Village ... At a time when tales of failing Black public school students reverberate across the nation , when the most frustrated Black parents are erecting their own private academies , Surry is symbolic of what can happen when a community galvanizes to remedy a bad situation . In Surry 's particular twist on parental involvement , the very people who entrust their children and grandchildren to public schools frequently are the same folks who administer education , teach kids , volunteer and even drive school buses . " When I went to work , we all went together , " says Bernette Wooden , a widow who has driven schoolchildren for 29 years .

Bottom row : The children love learning in the computer lab , and Marlenia Pulley ( at right ) puts in volunteer time in her daughter 's class when she gets off from work as a security guard . // Of course , not every parent is as visible as Mrs. Wooden , and there is substantial room for even more improvements in Surry 's schools . But the community 's participation has been key to pushing the district up from the bottom . When C.P. Penn arrived in 1977 as Surry 's first Black school superintendent , he inherited a system in shambles . " We had facilities that , when it rained , we had to close down , " he says . " If it snowed outside , it snowed inside . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Stephanie Headley , a parent , former school-board member and former local newspaper reporter who is White . " The difference in Surry-what separates it from surrounding counties that still have major problems-is that Black people took the chance to become leaders . " That coalescing of educators , parents and politicos has produced some measurable results . The number of highschool graduates going on to college , vocational and other programs-a fraction of them join the military-jumped from 25 percent in the late 1970 's to about 90 percent currently . The year the Lanes came back home , disbelieving state officials actually ordered Surry 's kids to retake a state math-and-reading exam on which they scored unusually well . State officials were emphatic that the students could not have made such a leap in so short a span of time . Twentyfive years ago , Surry 's kids tested far below the national norm , ranging from the seventeenth to twenty-seventh percentile among elementary students . Today test scores of Surry 's third and fifth graders are in the fifty-fifth and forty-seventh percentiles , respectively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned , but Blacks still account for 68 percent of enrollment . In addition to holding four of the five school-board seats , Blacks also have four of five slots on the county board of supervisors . A nuclear power plant built by Virginia Power and completed in 1972 has become Surry County 's richest taxpayer and largest single employer ; it now supplies the bulk of school funds that the board of supervisors dispenses . Stepping Up to the Challenge A ferry ride from Williamsburg across the James River , not far from where the first 20 Africans disembarked in the New World as indentured servants , Surry remains a country kind of place . Its people-the population hovers around 6,100-still wave greetings to a stranger rambling along back roads in a rented vehicle . Here , where daily pleasantries are passed across boundaries of race , class and generation , a White restaurant hostess old enough to be your mother will call a youngish Black woman " ma am . " Surry boasts a sizable group descended from comparatively privileged , landowning free Blacks , but it also counts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the navy yards of nearby Newport News and hotels of colonial Williamsburg . Some , like their forebears , remain tenant farmers . The gray-haired Hardy brothers , Walter , 71 , and Thomas , 68 , have spent their lives here and sent their children and some of their grandchildren to Surry 's schools . Before retiring , Walter was a supervisor at a meat-packing company , and Thomas , a supervisor at a naval shipyard . These men , locals say , were the first homegrown activists to sign up for duty when organizers from the Washington , D.C.-based National Association for the Southern Poor ( now known as the National Community Development Organization ) landed in Surry . Executive director Don Anderson , who is Black , arrived in 1968 to work with local citizens to solve the community 's problems with the school system , local health care and the lack of recreational facilities . The Hardys and others tilled the soil , making the seeds of political organizing Anderson planted bear fruit . " I did n't want to become involved here but I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a local convenience store during his so-called retirement . " Coming up , we saw White kids getting on the school bus while we were walking . We wanted things to be different for our children . " In a community where most every adult works by necessity , they strategized on the telephone and in meetings after hours , preached their message from pulpits and said it again at the ballot box . As a result , by the early 1970 's , 90 percent of the county 's eligible voters were registered , 60 percent of them Black . From this successful voter-registration drive , a tiny revolution ensued , resulting in Blacks winning political control . When the Supreme Court ordered schools desegregated in 1954 , Surry 's allWhite school board simply closed the White high school because White students had decamped to an all-White private academy that had been set up . The school board then continued to run a substandard predominantly Black public school system . In 1977 Black citizens , armed with their votes , pressed the board-now with two Black membersto replace Surry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White public high and headmaster of the White private academy ) with someone who looked like them . The board hired Penn as the first Black schools chief . Penn had been equipped to take on the Surry County challenge by his previous position : As principal at Prince Edward County High School in Farmville , Virginia , from 1969 to 1977 , he had worked to reorganize the Prince Edward County public school system , which had been closed down completely from 1959 through 1964 to avoid integration . Penn says commonsense maneuvers rallied community support in Surry : He ensured that every teacher was certified and that parents felt welcome inside classrooms . He invited parents to the school . He also took the schools to the people , so to speak , through a federally funded program called The Connection , in which a bus equipped with computers and teachers visited locations throughout the county and taught parents and other adults how to use computers , providing activities for children as well . ( Because of cutbacks in federal funds , the program , which had run for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightschool program and residents began flocking to the school instead . ) Surry also tested its students to see where they stood academically , and supported programs to take them to museums , science contests and other places they had never gone before . From Dilapidated to High-Tech A first order of business was providing clean , safe buildings that made kids feel they mattered and had reason to show up for class . Two years before Penn arrived , a new high school with an indoor gymnasium had already gone up , after the community had lobbied for it for decades-so students could have indoor physical-education classes and stop playing basketball outside in winter . Every school got its own cafeteria , avoiding what had been the daily transport of meals by bus . In 1995 the L.P. Jackson Middle School opened . Its centerpiece was a glassed-in technology lab , which included stations that emit laser signals to trigger the operation of one gadget or another ; an aerospace center testing the effect of wind on various objects ; and equipment to grow plants hydroponically ( with water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a real big city , " says eighth grader Herbert M.

This is our airport . This is our seaport . And here we 're going to make another airport . More money- " " So we can pay off the debt , " chimes in classmate Alvin Clayton , Herbert 's pal since second grade . Rita Holmes , who graduated from Surry schools , put her own children and those of her late sister through them , came back as a teacher and now is Jackson 's principal , one among a cadre of top-level Surry administrators that now includes five Blacks and one White . At the elementary school , Marlenia Pulley , still in the security guard 's uniform that she wears on her job , is helping her youngest child and his classmates staple construction-paper spiders . Her husband , Douglas Pulley , teaches at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always on a tight budget . So I usually come two or three times a week , just to volunteer , " says Pulley , who has two other school-age children . " Also , seeing what they do here helps me to deal with my children at home . " The Road Ahead Still , Surry is not a perfect place . Although drugs and violence have yet to intrude on the county 's school life in any substantial way , county sheriff deputies periodically show up at the school buildings with drug-sniffing dogs as a preventive measure . A visit to the middle school will show the brainiacs of an accelerated prealgebra class for seventh-graders . The class also includes three especially bright sixth graders . All but ten of the 25 students are Black . But the seven teen and preteen students in another class are struggling with basic arithmetic , adding one plus one , one plus two and so on , on the chalkboard . " Come on , " the instructor coaxes . " We 're s'posed to know this stuff . " The juxtaposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the overall performance of Surry students has plateaued , at least since the early 1990 's , with the youngest pupils consistently outscoring those in the middle and high schools . " We 're not at the bottom anymore , but we are certainly not at the top , " says LaVerne Daniels , who succeeded Penn this past July . Daniels 's faith in Surry 's potential for moving further along is fired by what she calls the spirit of Surry 's people . " When you have an awards program for attendance and academics , the parents pack the house . Many of them do n't even have a child in the school anymore , but they are there . That 's unique . The school is the community here ; the community is the school . " While there are test scores and other academic markers to address , the list of concerns does not end there . Elected officials have their own political divisions . There are budgetary gaps . Even more parents should take part , educators say , no matter the constraints on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and up again . Some Black residents applaud the return of White students and the prospect of sharing political power with White adults ; others fear Blacks might lose their grip on Surry . " The past is the past , " says Reginald Harrison , a parent , county supervisor and middle manager with tobacco giant Philip Morris . " The only thing we can do is to challenge parents to become even more active than they have been , to learn about the budget process , how taxes are spent . " Such tensions barely surface on Kristie Kings schoolgirl radar . A junior honor student , she has Spelman College on her mind , she says by way of introducing herself . Her mama has told her all about the depths from which Surry schools have risen , she adds , falling into her own rapid-fire recitation : " Before Dr. Penn came , everybody thought of Surry County as Sorry County . Right now , the surrounding counties really envy us . Now , we are special in Surry . " Many throughout this region share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a point . Surry , he says , should not be the exception among floundering Black school districts . " What we have done , " he said , " is possible anyplace . " + HOW YOU CAN HELP YOUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS Because the public schools are financed with your tax dollars , they are accountable to you . So get involved . For starters , make your presence known at the schoolhouse . Begin the school year by introducing yourself to your child 's teachers . Build alliances by getting to know the adults who spend at least as much time with your kids as you do during the school year . Your involvement shows teachers that someone at home is willing to reinforce what goes on in the classroom , puts schools on notice that parents also are watching their children 's education and reminds your children that you expect their best effort too . If showing up in person at the school becomes impossible , stay in touch with educators by telephone and letter . Or tap a relative , neighbor or other surrogate to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider these ways to have an impact on your children 's schools . * Attend school-board meetings .
