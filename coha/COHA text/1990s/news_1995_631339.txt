Matt Goldshore of Chappaqua , N.Y. , found his way to Africa via the University of Texas , where he was studying chemistry with plans for medical school . One summer , he signed up to study at a crowded hospital in Moshi , Tanzania . That experience changed Goldshore 's life . He came back resolved to help fight HIV , malaria , and other diseases afflicting Moshi 's people . Yet he doubted anyone could conquer such scourges as one physician treating one patient at a time . So , like a growing number of students , he set out to learn how whole populations become vulnerable to disease . He went to Washington , D.C. , to study epidemiology at George Washington University . The story of modern epidemics is one of frighteningly fatal germs hopping the globe as readily as a YouTube video . Increasingly , the world calls on epidemiologists to respond not only to outbreaks of diseases but also to natural disasters , food-borne illnesses , and life-threatening chronic diseases . Epidemiologists design the studies that lead to solutions . An English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plotting where a rash of cholera deaths had occurred in London . Snow 's map revealed a cluster of cases around a suspect water pump . When the pump handle was removed , the cholera outbreak ended . " We did n't even know about infection until the late 19th century , " said David Celentano , interim chair of epidemiology at Baltimore 's Johns Hopkins University . The world 's first school of public health was started at Hopkins in 1918 . Its first targets included tuberculosis . Subsequently , epidemiologists discovered that mathematical methods work well at rooting out the causes of heart disease , chronic ailments , and some injuries . Since HIV/AIDS surfaced during the 1980s , the frontiers of epidemiology have moved toward clinical trials of drugs and other interventions . " We do n't wait for people to die to do our AIDS studies , " Celentano said . The AIDS epidemic touched off an avalanche of research grants that spurred the growth of public health schools across the nation and created jobs for people with skills in epidemiology . Holders of graduate degrees now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the pharmaceutical industry , along with hospitals and other private businesses . Federal agencies , such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration , are constantly hiring . At its headquarters in Atlanta , the CDC trains new public health graduates with strong academic records and teamwork skills . Trainees can earn more than $70,000 annually , plus bonuses , and their experience makes them very competitive for career CDC jobs with plump benefits . Double the discipline . More universities are starting to offer their undergraduates a public health major thatincludes epidemiology . Johns Hopkins made that move seven years ago , and public health is now the second-most popular major for undergrads . For grad students , the School of Public Health 's 530-member full-time faculty can offer a long menu of research topics . A Hopkins master 's in public health costs $46,200 , but the program takes just one backbreaking year of study . At more than 80 other universities across the United States , students are finding solid graduate education in epidemiology , mentoring , and research opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , has a well-respected public health school with a research-oriented epidemiology faculty . Breaking down walls between disciplines distinguishes the University of Michigan from many other schools of public health . Many of its 108 faculty members have joint appointments in medicine , sociology , environmental health , or other disciplines . Students learn to master the statistical tools of epidemiology and apply them to other problems . In the nation 's capital , George Washington University is training women and men for the public health workforce . Faculty members often provide technical assistance to government agencies such as the District of Columbia Health Department . That 's 23-year-old Matt Goldshore 's story . Working on an HIV study through the D.C. Health Department was more than just a job he took while earning a master 's degree . The project taught him ways of connecting with people , a skill he will need as a medical student and , someday , a disease fighter in Africa . In August , Goldshore will begin seven more years of study toward his M.D. and Ph.D . in public health from GW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , " he says . **** Smart Choices General Surgery . The proliferation of HMOs was tough on general surgeons . But a growing shortage in both urban and rural markets is creating new demand for their skills , says Dana Christian Lynge , associate professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle . So is the relentless aging of the boomers , which is also driving demand in cardiology , urology , gastroenterology , and orthopedics . Insider Tip Debt has long been the downside of going to med school , but some institutions are tackling the problem with serious cash . The Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine is waiving tuition for all future students who practice medicine and conduct research in primary care or any specialty . The University of Central Florida , which paid all tuition and living expenses for the incoming class at its new med school , is raising money for 120 more full scholarships . The Mayo Clinic is waiving 50 percent of tuition to all who are admitted ( some can get more ) . Harvard , Yale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle-income families . Getting In First Steps . You may not be a medical student yet , but you 'll want to visit the website of the American Medical Student Association . Go to amsa.org/premed for loads of premed offerings , including nationwide chapters for doctor wannabes , conferences , and internship and advocacy opportunities . AMSA also provides avenues for career development and other benefits for its premed members . Required Reading . You ca n't take the Medical College Admission Test without certifying that you 've read about it first , so look for " MCAT Essentials " at aamc.org . The exam is computer based and is offered nationwide . About 60,000 people take it every year ; exam dates ( 25 , between January and September ) are chosen to meet most med school application deadlines . Already taken it ? Schools generally accept scores dating back two or three years .
