Range rider John Tyson hunts for clues in the slaughter of 33 wild horses gunned down in the Nevada hills Photograph " They suffered in ways you and I ca n't imagine , " Tyson ( at the crime scene , Jan. 2 ) says of the slain horses . // usk was falling on Dec. 27 when John Tyson arrived at Largomarcino Canyon , 10 miles east of Reno . A part-time state brand inspector and Storey County range management officer who occasionally tracks down cattle rustlers , Tyson was responding to a report that someone had shot a wild horse . The gathering darkness lent an aptly eerie atmosphere to the ghoulish sight awaiting him . " All I saw were carcasses , " recalls Tyson , 53 . No fewer than 9 horses lay dead or dying . After a three-day field investigation , the death toll grew to 33 , with bodies scattered over 15 square miles . " We realized , " says Tyson , " that we had a major , major horse annihilation case . " Judging from the evidence gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the dirt tracks that snake through the area and , over the course of four or five hours , gunned down the grazing horses with one or more high-powered rifles . " If it was moving and breathing , they shot it , " concludes Tyson . " I got ta believe they enjoyed every God-danged minute of it . " The victims were easy marks . Though horses are ordinarily startled by loud sounds , those living in Nevada 's Virginia-range foothills often ignore them because the area has become a mecca for hunters and target shooters . Deliberately or not , most of the animals were shot in the gut or hind legs , ensuring a slow , agonizing death . " I found one on the hillside ; she was lying there 12 to 14 hours , just struggling , " says David Thain , the state veterinarian who examined the corpses . " This is the most horrific thing I 've ever seen . " The massacre galvanized national outrage , and within days various animal protection organizations had contributed more than $35,000 toward a reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wild horse , " says Betty Kelly , who belongs to Wild Horse Spirit Ltd. , a local equine rescue group . Because the horses were deemed state property , the shootings are considered grand larceny , carrying a 1-to-10-year sentence . Unlike the thousands of wild horses roaming U.S. Bureau of Land Management property throughout the West , the 1,000 or so in the Virginia range , which is almost all privately owned , are not federally protected . Nor are they regulated . " These horses have proliferated and become a nuisance in a lot of respects , " says Dennis Journigan , deputy chief of the state Bureau of Livestock Identification , noting that they often wander onto highways or graze on private land . " They get to be like pests . " Nevertheless , Tyson , who is helping coordinate an investigation involving several state and local agencies , has treated the killings just as he would 33 homicides . " It was a matter of documenting every dead animal , " he says . " I walked a lot of miles looking for shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day job : As a reporter for KOLO-TV , Reno 's ABC affiliate , he hosts the John Tyson Journal , a show in the Charles Kuralt vein celebrating Nevada 's Old West heritage . Silver-haired , with a bushy moustache , Tyson looks like a Hollywood embodiment of that heritage . In fact he grew up in Pennsylvania , where his late father , John Sr. , was an engineer for Bethlehem Steel . His path to Reno has been a winding one . After graduating from Williamsport High School in 1962 , Tyson enlisted in the Air Force , and in 1966 he was sent to Vietnam , where he spent a year as an air base security officer outside Saigon . Following his discharge , Tyson held two law enforcement jobs in California before becoming police chief in Eureka Springs , Ark. , in 1979 . " I suffer from the Screw you , I quit ' syndrome , " he admits . " That caused me to move around a lot . " Tyson next headed for Nevada , where he worked first as a cowboy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrolling 80,000 acres in Storey County on horseback . To boost his income , he landed a job as a local radio deejay and in 1986 signed with KOLO . The father of two grown daughters , he married his third wife , Carol , 48 , a psychiatric nurse , in 1995 . The couple now share a ranch near Virginia City called the Rafter 7-Bar-M . Little in Tyson 's colorful resume prepared him for the carnage he found Dec. 27 . The stench of decomposing flesh pierced the chill high desert air as he and other investigators used trucks to haul carcasses to a makeshift outdoor morgue . There horses were X-rayed in hopes that embedded slugs might help identify the weapon that killed them . " When we find this guy , he 's going to be the kind of person who has no conscience , " says co-investigator Journigan , who knows the type well : As a California Highway Patrol officer in 1969 , he arrested Charles Manson . Tyson has little doubt that the killer will be brought to justice . " We will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . " Or he 's got a girlfriend he 'll knock around and she 'll snitch him off . " Contempt drips from his voice . " This is an offense to our senses as Westerners , " says the transplanted Easterner " It 's like somebody desecrating the flag . " Photograph " He 's been around ; he 's a good investigator , " a detective says of Tyson ( second from right ) . Photograph " These horses are as much a part of the land as any other critter , " says Tyson of the wild mustangs that roam Nevada 's Virginia range . // <p>
