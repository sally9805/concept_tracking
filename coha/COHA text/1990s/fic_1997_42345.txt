Today I 've been watching it snow and thinking of Dorothy . This was in Rochester , before your sister was born , when you were four or five and your father worked most weekends . ( I have always thought it ironic that your father made our living as an efficiency expert , a job that required so many hours of overtime . ) We lived in a pink brick Georgian at the end of a cul-de-sac called Country Club Road . Your father had flown out from Detroit to find it and had bought it over one weekend . You were too young to travel at the time so we stayed behind . I remember he called from the Holiday Inn to let me know he had found a house and how , when I asked him to describe it , he said it had an " expansive den . " <p> We moved the following weekend and I suddenly found myself in a pink Georgian in the middle of a Rochester winter . I tried to keep my spirits up . I went around to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ostensibly looking for playmates for you . Dorothy lived in one of those grand cold Tudors with leaded windows and azaleas and box hedges trimmed into spades . Her Christmas decorations were still out-garlands of evergreen wrapped with white lights and a red-ribboned wreath on the front door . I rang the doorbell and Dorothy opened the door as if expecting me . I remember thinking how much she looked like Audrey Hepburn . <p> " You 're here . " <p> " Marion Clark , " I said , holding out my hand . <p> " Oh , " she said , shaking it . " I 'm sorry . " <p> " You thought I was someone else ? " I said . She nodded . " Forgive me , it 's cold . Come in . " <p> She was a woman who could say forgive me without batting an eye . <p> The inside of her house felt nothing like the outside ; it held a sweet thick smell I recognized as incense . There were large pillows scattered around the floor in the living room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I accepted her drink offer , though it was two o'clock in the afternoon and , for those years at least , your father and I had a rule about no cocktails before six . <p> I asked for an old-fashioned . It sounded right . She nodded when I said it as if I had passed a secret test ; then she led me into the living room . " You are who I was waiting for , " she said , ducking out . I sat on the couch . It was draped with a batik fabric that had hundreds of tiny mirrors stitched into it , and I remember how I thought that if light ever got through those heavy webbed-green windows the mirrors would reflect it like so many diamonds , as if the couch were afire . <p> Dorothy returned with an ornate tray and sat down across from me on one of the floor pillows . " So , " she said , handing me my drink . " Let me guess . You 're new . You 're bored . You 're looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . " <p> " I suppose you could say that . " <p> " Well , cheers then , " she said , lifting her glass . " To playmates . " <p> " Salud , " I said , I 'm sure wanting to sound continental . I felt paltry in comparison to this creature in black silk . I had worn my usual wool slacks and snow boots . How could I have known ? <p> I sipped my drink . She had made it quite strong , and from the first taste I felt transported . <p> " So , " she said . " Let me tell you what there is to know . First off , I 'm Dorothy . I do n't think I ever said that . Not Dot or Dottie , please , but Dorothy . My mother was very particular about this . Anyone who would call me anything but got a talking to , including teachers and boyfriends . She named me Dorothy after Dorothy Lamour , who I have later come to find out goes by Dot . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I live in this monstrous house with a husband , Rick , and twin sons , Richard and Ross . It was not my idea to go with R. In fact , I was completely against it , but Rick insisted so what could I do . I had just been through forty-one hours of labor and you might say my mind was a little foggy and besides , he 's from Canada of all places . " Dorothy paused and took a sip of her drink . Behind her , through the thick glass , I saw that it had begun to snow , again , and wondered if she was n't cold in nothing more than silk . <p> " We moved here about seventeen months ago and the boys think it 's great and Rick plays golf and I am bored out of my mind . Rochester , for God 's sake . Who would have thought I would end up here ? I am the daughter of missionaries . I grew up everywhere , including Calcutta and Beijing , and I am the first to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find it . " She took a deeper sip . " Do you know what I mean ? " <p> " I suppose so , " I said . I felt hot in my coat , but she had n't offered to take it . I felt as if I had entered some sort of circus fun house and Dorothy sat before me as the reflection of what I could become , if I squinted my eyes , if I poured a drink at two o'clock and burned incense in Rochester . <p> " Oh , I 'm not saying there 's nothing to do here . There 's the club and a good bridge group and dances every Saturday and around Christmas they have the Bachelors ' Ball , which is really for all the married folk who go and get blasted to the hilt and switch husbands and that sort . We 'll talk about that into the next year and the spring and it will give us something to think about come fall , again , when we are feeling kind of blowzy and old and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Too bad you were n't moved in before that , you could have met the gang and added your own rumor to the mill . " <p> I must say it got to a point where I simply watched her mouth move . I could not get past a woman using the word blowzy in a sentence and getting away with it . She sounded so grand . She reminded me of a lone exotic fish , the type you might see in one of those overpriced pet stores swimming around and around and around an aquarium , the glass sides of which are nearly opaque from algae let to grow , as if the poor thing has been forgotten . <p> " Come on , " she said at last , draining her drink . " The boys wo n't be home for an hour and I need to shop . You come . I want help . " <p> I stood . I 'm not sure how much time had passed , but I remember thinking that you would be fine , set with a new babysitter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very full raccoon coat . Then she opened the front door and stepped out . I followed her around to the garage . <p> " Do n't you need the air ? " she said , lighting a cigarette . She stood by the garage door and smoked . " Rick does n't let me do this in the house and who can blame him , the plants and all . Terrible habit , really . My teeth are yellow . But it gives me something to do , do n't you think that ? If nothing else , this is something to do . " We shared the cigarette , then stamped into the garage and got into her car , the make of which I can not remember . She was not a woman who would take much stock in automobiles , though she did love clothes and had the most elegant wardrobe of anyone I had ever known , before or since . I remember when I got the news that she was dead my second or third thought was of those clothes , of what they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We drove into downtown Rochester fast , through yellow lights just changed to red . She had turned on the radio , and I remember how good it felt to have had one drink and to be riding in the front seat of a warm car in the middle of an afternoon with a new friend . She pulled over once we got to the department store-one of those once-grand chains you find in depressed cities . I felt a bit blue , stepping out of the car into the cold to enter such a faded place . We should have pulled up to Bonwit 's and left the keys in the car for the valet . But soon the mood shifted ; there were aisles of brightly lit things and a makeup counter where a few well-preserved women stood in lab coats and beckoned us closer . I was game but Dorothy took my hand . <p> " Come on , " she said and led me to the escalator , one of the old kind with wooden railings . We rode up to the sportswear section on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked her . <p> " You 'll see , " she said and smiled . <p> She led me past sportswear toward the back of the second floor , through a maze of girdled mannequins and mounds of flesh-colored bras and panties on sale . The nightgowns hung along the rear wall , a rack of silky expensive things I would have normally passed right by . Dorothy stood in front of them . <p> " Are n't they divine ? " she said . <p> They were part of some kind of early Easter display-pink and blue and green and yellow silks . " I ca n't wear yellow , but you , " Dorothy said , choosing a yellow one from the rack . " You could do it . " <p> She held the yellow nightgown up to me and admired it . I looked back at her , again thinking of her as some kind of mirror in which I stood reflected . " It 's lovely , " I said . <p> Dorothy smiled again . " But you do like it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carried the nightgown over to the real mirror . It was difficult to tell whether I liked it or not . I felt foolish . There I stood in the middle of a Rochester winter holding a yellow silk nightgown over my wool coat and wool stacks , sure that if I actually tried it on I would look absurd in my thick socks and pale arms . <p> " It 's lovely , really , " I said , carrying it back to Dorothy and putting it on the rack . " Perhaps I 'll come back for the sales . " <p> Dorothy shrugged . " I think it is a wonderful color for you . Not many can wear yellow , " she said . <p> She stood and stared at me for a moment . I attributed the strangeness I felt to the old-fashioned . <p> She invited me in as we pulled into her garage and I accepted . I had so rarely had company in the afternoons in Detroit . Once inside , she offered another drink . There was something of a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two old-fashioneds before six . I felt as if the world could indeed open up for me and I could step in . <p> She brought out the fresh drinks on a new tray . I pulled off my snow boots and this time she offered to take my coat and I said yes . I felt so comfortable , as if I could curl up on the mirrored couch and sleep for years . I tried to explain the day to your father that night but I could not find the right words . <p> With Dorothy , the right words were easy . I told her about our moves , and about you and your birth . I told her how your father and I hoped to have another child soon . <p> She told me again how the R names had been her husband 's idea . She told me again that her parents were missionaries and that the white porcelain elephant in the corner had come directly from Burma , before they had shut the gates , and that her mother was a great beauty with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the villages had been far more interested in looking at her hair than they had been in hearing her preach about God and Jesus . <p> Then she asked me did I believe in God and Jesus , and at the time I did , so I said yes . <p> She said there were plenty of churches she could show me , but that she could not go inside . That she had sworn off it like she had sworn off any more children and any more sex with her husband . <p> It was at that point I said I should go , not because I disliked her using such an unfamiliar word , but rather because I knew that with Dorothy I could say much that I might come to regret , that I could speak words that had been , before this , light as balloons drifting through my mind . To speak them would be to give them heft and weight . <p> " Good-bye , love , " she said at the door , kissing me on both cheeks . " See you tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She held my coat up for me and I put my arms through the sleeves and felt so entirely warm , from her , from this , from the promise of another day , that I walked home slowly through the bitter cold , balancing on the ridged rain gutters that ran on either side of Country Club Road , slipping some on the ice . It was the part of the day I would later come to know as the blue hour . Dorothy said she had picked it up somewhere , she thought perhaps Paris . L'heure bleu . She said it seemed to her always the best way to describe that time of early evening when the world seemed trapped in melancholy and all its regrets for all its mislaid plans for the day were spelled in the fading clouds . <p> This is , quite truthfully , how she would phrase things . <p> Once home , I picked you up and kissed you , and the two of us drove the babysitter back to wherever she had come from . On our return , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I reached into my coat pocket for my wallet and felt the silk wadded down so deep , I thought for an instant I had never noticed the fine lining of the wool . Then I pulled it out . The yellow nightgown , of course . <p> You came to despise Rochester winters , could never play outside , or for only a few hours , since I was a nervous mother and did n't want you too long in the cold . You would stand , your nose pressed to the plate-glass door , amphibian-like fingers out and spread wide . You would wish for anyplace else . <p> But the next afternoon you were still excited by the newness of it , of your room , of places to go . The babysitter arrived particularly buoyant , a fresh-faced high-school girl you might have grown into if we had stayed . You led her up the stairs to the place in the hallway where you had set up your Barbie palace , and I called to both of you that I would be gone a few hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shone with an unfamiliar light ; it had stopped snowing the night before , and a sun that seemed as foreign to that city as a locust storm or a tornado had appeared in the morning through pale clouds . The sky looked like a Renaissance painting of a sky , with pinks and blues and mother-of-pearl grays . It hurt to look at it but that we did , Dorothy and I. She had met me at the door and led me outside , where she told me to stand , my back to her back , and stare straight up . Her hair smelled of something herbal , and I could feel her shoulder blades against my own . She wanted us to have our coats off , to lean against one another and to look straight up and to close our eyes and imagine spring . <p> " Think of yourself standing in the middle of a whiteout and then suddenly the white is blown away by a giant fan and everything 's clear and you can see for miles and miles , " she said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always had a tough time shutting my eyes and seeing myself . All I could do was smell Dorothy 's hair and feel her shoulders through her sweater ; all I could picture was the one tiny button , looped with silk thread , at the nape of her neck . 0 <p> I visited Dorothy every afternoon and every afternoon she met me at the door , glamorous , as if she had slept in her evening clothes . Winter eventually gave way to a wet spring ; the trees shook out their new buds and appeared to blossom , collectively , on one particular day in May . It was a few weeks after that that Dorothy met me at the door and put her hand over my eyes . I felt a flutter-her heart , though it might have been my own eyelashes against her skin . Her perfume smelled of cinnamon and tea . <p> " As you know , " she said , leading me in . " I grew up elsewhere . We were missionaries . Or my parents were . Then my mother split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab boy , and toured northern Africa on horseback . I just found out she died , in a flood . " I had heard this story before , or most of it . What I did not know was the part about Dorothy 's mother in costume . My understanding was that she had died years before . My initial reaction was then of surprise not at the news of Dorothy 's mother 's death but at the news that during this long winter spent in Dorothy 's living room , Dorothy 's mother had roamed the world . <p> " This arrived yesterday , " Dorothy said , taking her hand away . " Ta da ! " <p> Before me , raised awkwardly on the Persian rug I had admired many times on the floor of Dorothy 's living room , was a tent unlike any I had ever seen . It had many peaks , for starters , and from each a small flag hung , limply ; the fabric was the color of sand and across its surface were painted hundreds , perhaps a thousand pairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I think I gasped or made some kind of sound that indicated I was truly amazed , because Dorothy put her hand on my shoulder as if to steady me . <p> " It came in the mail . I think she painted it , I do n't know . Anyway , it arrived in a box , with her . " Dorothy lit a cigarette . <p> " She wants me to take her somewhere . To spend the night in this and then to throw her out . " <p> " Her ? " I said . <p> Dorothy gestured to a small urn on the coffee table . " Will you come ? " she asked . <p> " Of course , " I said without consideration . As I have told you , Dorothy was my friend . <p> We left on a hot June day , the trees now thick with green . Dorothy knew of a lake not far from the city where we could pay a small fee and spend the night . We pitched the tent there , near the car and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake stretched out endlessly beneath the shadow of a mountain known as Mt . Rattlesnake . It was from the top of it , Dorothy informed me , that we would toss her mother at sunrise . <p> That night we built a small fire and fried eggs . Dorothy sat on a tree stump and talked . She told me again of her mother , and her brother , who was missing in action in Korea . She told me about her father , whose belief in Jesus , she said , left no room for anything else , no place for a daughter and a son , not to mention a wife . " I can understand why she snapped , " Dorothy said . " I mean , think of how dull , no matter where . No one can live like that , in a fishbowl . " <p> I sat and listened . The heat was god-awful . I had on the yellow nightgown . I had never worn it before ; it seemed silly in the winter and when the weather turned warmer I entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an out-of-theway drawer for my athletic socks , that I came upon it , crumpled into a silk ball , cocoon-like . I packed it who knows why ; it was hot , as I have said , the night balmy in the way summer nights can be in places near Rochester , as if all the melted snow has been absorbed into the air , so heavy with it that your weight feels tripled . No matter . We fanned ourselves outside the strange tent and drank old-fashioneds from a thermos that smelled of chicken soup . Dorothy talked . She wore her bathing suit-the style popular at the time , polka-dotted , with a ruffled skirt-and her hair , that horse-brown color that is not at all ordinary , she had combed into a tight bun . I could see her through the just dark . I watched her hands , punctuating . <p> I do not entirely remember what happened next , how it came that the two of us , me in my yellow silk , Dorothy in her bathing suit , wandered around the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a tension about the evening , something awkward in the weather , as if a thunderstorm might erupt at any moment or lightning tear across the sky . Swallows behaved as bats , swooping about our heads , and frenzied balls of mosquitoes bred over the shallower parts of the lake water . At some point Dorothy took my hand to stress something , and she did not let go . <p> Before I continue I should say that this was a time when women had clear boundaries , and even in discussion the boundaries were observed- . Dorothy had already broken down those boundaries between the two of us , and I believed her holding my hand as we walked the lakeshore trail was just a natural extension of all those afternoons together , lying jagged on-her Persian rug . I do n't know . I can tell you that the fireflies were thick and that the only sound we could hear across the lake was the sound of fish jumping . My silk nightgown felt light against my skin , damp from the humidity . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were , quite truthfully , alone . Because of this , perhaps , we drew close , aware , as one becomes in certain moments , of the brevity of life . <p> After some time Dorothy stopped and turned toward me . " Marion , " she said , and put her hands on my shoulders . Her hair , as I have told you , was pulled back tightly , and when she smiled her whole face seemed to lean into her mouth or radiate out from it in a way remarkable . Only her eyes were sad . <p> " You are my best friend , " she said . <p> You are too young to understand what this once meant between women . No matter . I can tell you that there will be times when you have to choose between beginning again in a cold and lonely place or making do with whatever fragile shelter you have already built . I understood this , and knew that after that night I would never have another friend like Dorothy , nor would I return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , back to back , to wish for spring . When she tried to kiss me I turned away . " I 'm sorry , " is what I said . <p> I slept that night outside and she slept in the tent . The flags hung limply . The next morning we woke before sunrise and climbed Mt . Rattlesnake . The top of the mountain was a collection : if rocks , some moss covered , some bare . From there we looked down at our tent , a miniature in the distance , and saw clearly the path we walked the night before . <p> Dorothy held the urn up high intending to scatter her mother 's ashes into the wind , but there was no wind and so the ashes simply fell into a heap on the rock on which we were standing . The two of us used branches to scrape them over the edge and then sat and watched the sun ascend . " I 'm afraid she would have been displeased with me , " Dorothy said after some time . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , are n't they ? Horribly displeased . " <p> " I do n't know , " I said , and took her hand in mine . " No , " I said . <p> Dorothy died several years after we moved to Norfolk . I got the news over the telephone . We had lost touch , but that was not so unusual in those days when a woman stayed in a place only until her husband 's next transfer . She had sent me Christmas cards , of course , and a longer note when she heard about your sister 's birth . I still felt close to her in a way I 've felt with no friend since , though after that excursion we saw each other rarely . Still , I waved whenever I drove down Country Club Road and passed her Tudor , forgetting that her windows were overgrown , imagining that she might be looking out , seeing me . <p> When Rick called , we were packing for Durham , getting things organized for the movers the next day . I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leaving . When I hung up the phone , I went back to what I had been doing , rolling china into sheaves of newspaper , marking cardboard boxes den , kitchen . I did not think of Dorothy . Instead , I thought of the next neighborhood , the next house : how I would paint the living-room walls , paper the bedrooms ; how I would knock on the front doors of the houses on our new street , introducing myself , introducing you and your sister , accepting when the ones at home invited us in for tea and cookies . It felt somehow impossible to think of anything else , to think of the way she must have looked , so indiscreet , so inelegant , slumped against the steering wheel of that automobile going nowhere , idling in the garage over the long weekend Rick had chosen to take the boys camping . Instead , I pictured her in her coffin , pictured her in a yellow silk nightgown , because she always said things like silky nightgowns helped to chase away the blowzy feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or beast , she said , should be left to swim alone . <p> IMG
