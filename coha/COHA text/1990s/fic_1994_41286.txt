At the far end of their lawn , down by the large pond or small marshy lake , he is at work in " his " daylily garden  --  weeding , feeding , clearing out dead growth to make room for new  --  when the ring of the telephone begins this story . They spend so much of their day outdoors , in the season , that years ago they installed an outside phone bell under the porch-roof overhang . As a rule , they bring a cordless phone out with them too , onto the sundeck or the patio , where they can usually reach it before the answering machine takes over . It is too early in the season , however , for them to have resumed that convenient habit . Anyhow , this is a weekday . midmorning ; she 's indoors still , in her studio . She 'll take the call . <p> The telephone rings a second time , but not a third . On his knees in the daylily garden , he has paused , trowel in hand , and straightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he always finds mildly agreeable but now suddenly relishes : simple physical work with clean soil in fine air and sunlight . The call could be routine : some bit of business , some service person . In the season , he 's the one who normally takes weekday-morning calls , not to interrupt her concentration in the studio ; but it 's not quite the season yet . The caller could be a friend  --  although their friends generally do n't call them before noon . It could be a telephone solicitor : there seem to be more of those every year , enough to lead them to consider unlisting their number , but not quite yet to unlist it . It could be a misdial . <p> If presently she steps out onto the sundeck , looking for him , whether to bring him the cordless phone if the call is for him or to report some news , this story 's beginning will have ended , its middle begun . <p> Presently she steps out onto the sundeck , overlooking their lawn and the large pond or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big old drafting table , working-trying to work , anyhow ; pretending to work ; maybe actually almost really working-when that phone call began this story . From her upholstered swivel chair , through one of the water-facing windows of her studio , she could see him on hands and knees down in his daylily garden along the water 's edge . Indeed , she had been more or less watching him , preoccupied in his old jeans and sweatshirt and gardening gloves , while she worked or tried or pretended to work at her worktable . At the first ring , she saw him straighten his back and square his shoulders , his trowel hand resting on his thigh top , and at the second ( which she had waited for before picking up the receiver ) look houseward and remove one glove . At the non-third ring , as she said hello to the caller , he pushed back his eyeglasses with his ungloved hand . She had continued then to watch him  --  returning to his task , his left hand still ungloved for picking out the weeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caller 's news . <p> The news is bad indeed . Not quite so bad , perhaps , as her very-worst-case scenario , but considerably worse than her average-feared scenarios , and enormously worse than her best-case , hoped-against-hope scenarios . The news is of the sort that in one stroke eliminates all agreeable plans and expectations  --  indeed , all prospect of real pleasure  --  from the moment of its communication . In effect , the news puts a period to this pair 's prevailingly happy though certainly not carefree life ; there can not imaginably be further delight in it , of the sort that they have been amply blessed with through their years together . All that is over now : for her already ; for him and for them as soon as she relays the news to him-which , of course , she must and promptly will . <p> Gone . Finished . Done with . <p> Meanwhile , she knows the news , but he does not , yet . From her worktable she sees him poke at the lily-bed mulch with the point of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ungloved other hand , a bit of chickweed , wire grass , or ground ivy . She accepts the caller 's terse expression of sympathy and duly expresses in return her appreciation for that unenviable bit of message-bearing . She has asked only a few questions  --  there are n't many to be asked  --  and has attended the courteous , pained , terrible but unsurprising replies . Presently she replaces the cordless telephone on its base and leans back for a moment in her comfortable work chair to watch her mate at his ordinary , satisfying labor and to assimilate what she has just been told . <p> There is , however , no assimilating what she has just been told  --  or , if there is , that assimilation is to be measured in years , even decades , not in moments , days , weeks , months , seasons . She must now get up from her chair , walk through their modest , pleasant house to the sundeck , cross the lawn to the daylily garden down by the lake or pond , and tell him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that as he proceeds with his gardening his mind is almost certainly on the phone call . He will be wondering whether she 's still speaking with the caller or has already hung up the telephone and is en route to tell him the news . Perhaps the call was merely a routine bit of business , not worth reporting until their paths recross at coffee break or lunchtime . A wrong number , even , it might have been , or another pesky telephone solicitor . He may perhaps be half-deciding by now that it was , after all , one of those innocuous possibilities . <p> She compresses her lips , closes and reopens her eyes , exhales , rises , and goes to tell him the news . <p> He sees her , presently , step out onto the sundeck , and signals his whereabouts with a wave of his trowel in case she has n't yet spotted him down on his knees in the daylily garden . At that distance , he can read nothing in her expression or carriage , but he notes that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossibly , of course , she could be simply taking a break from her studio work to stretch her muscles , refill her coffee mug , use the toilet , enjoy a breath of springtime air , and report to him that the phone call was nothing  --  a misdial , or one more canvasser . She has stepped from the deck and begun to cross the lawn , himward , unurgently . He resumes weeding out the wire grass that perennially invades their flower beds , its rhizomes spreading under the mulch , secretly reticulating the clean soil and choking the lily bulbs . A weed , he would agree , is not an organism wicked in itself ; it 's simply one of nature 's creatures going vigorously about its natural business in a place where one wishes that it would not . He finds something impressive , even awesome , in the intricacy and tenacity of those rhizomes and their interconnections ; uproot one carefully and it seems to network the whole bed  --  the whole lawn , probably . Break it off at any point and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hydra . So it 's terrible , too , in its way , as well as splendid , that blind tenacity , that evolved persistence and virtual ineradicability , heedless of the daylilies that it competes with and vitiates , indifferent to everything except its mindless self-proliferation . It occurs to him that , on the other hand , that same persistence is exactly what he cultivates in their flowers , pinching back the rhododendrons and dead-heading yesterday 's lilies to encourage multiple blooms . An asset here , a liability there , from the gardener 's point of view , while Nature shrugs its nonjudgmental shoulders . Unquestionably , however , it would be easier to raise a healthy crop of wire grass by weeding out the daylilies than vice versa . <p> With such reflections he distracts himself , or tries or pretends to distract himself , as she steps unhurriedly from the sundeck and begins to cross the lawn , himward . <p> She is , decidedly in no hurry to cross the lawn and say what she must say . There is her partner , best friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half chore , half hobby , a respite from his own busy professional life . Apprehensive as he will have been since the telephone call , he is still as if all right ; she , too , and their life and foreseeable future  --  as if still all right . In order to report to him the dreadful news , she must cross the entire lawn , with its central cherry tree : a magnificently spreading , fully mature Kwanzan , just now at the absolute pink peak of its glorious bloom . About halfway between the sundeck and that Kwanzan cherry stands a younger and smaller , but equally vigorous , Zumi crab apple that they themselves put in a few seasons past to replace a storm-damaged predecessor . It , too , is a near-perfect specimen of its kind , and likewise at or just past the peak of its flowering , the new green leaves thrusting already through the white clustered petals . To reach her husband with the news , she must pass under that Kwanzan cherry  --  the centerpiece of their property , really , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For her to reach that cherry tree will take a certain small time : perhaps twenty seconds , as she 's in no hurry . To stroll leisurely even to the Zumi crab apple takes ten or a dozen seconds  --  about as long as it takes to read this sentence aloud . Walking past that perfect crab apple , passing under that resplendent cherry , crossing the remaining half of the lawn down to the lily garden , and telling him the news  --  these sequential actions will constitute the middle of this story , already in progress . <p> In the third of a minute required for her to amble from sundeck to cherry tree  --  even in the dozen seconds from deck to crab apple ( she 's passing that crab apple now )  --  her companion will have weeded his way perhaps one trowel 's length farther through his lily bed , which borders that particular stretch of pond-or lakeside for several yards , to the far corner of their lot , where the woods begin . Musing upon this circumstance  --  a reflex of insulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind of Zeno 's famous paradox of Achilles and the tortoise . Swift Achilles , Zeno teases , can never catch the tortoise , for in whatever short time required for him to close half the hundred yards between them , the sluggish animal will have moved perhaps a few inches ; and in the very short time required to halve that remaining distance , an inch or two more , et cetera  --  ad infinitum , in as much as finite distances , however small , can be halved forever . It occurs to her , indeed  --  although she is neither philosopher nor mathematician  --  that her husband need n't even necessarily be moving away from her , so to speak , as she passes now under the incredibly full-blossomed canopy of the Kwanzan cherry and pauses to be quietly re-astonished , if scarcely soothed , by its splendor . He ( likewise Zeno 's tortoise ) could remain fixed in the same spot ; he could even rise and stroll to meet her , run to meet her under that flowered canopy ; in every case and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , re-halved , and re-re-halved forever , ad infinitum . Like the figured lovers in Keats 's " Ode on a Grecian Urn " ( another image from her college days ) , she and he will never touch , although unlike those , these are living people en route to the how-many-thousandth tete-a-tete of their years together  --  when , alas , she must convey to him her happiness-ending news . In John Keats 's words and by the terms of Zeno 's paradox , forever will he love and she be fair . Forever they 'll go on closing the distance between them  --  as they have in effect been doing , like any well-bonded pair , since Day One of their connection  --  yet never closing it altogether : asymptotic curves that eternally approach but never meet . <p> But of course they will meet , very shortly , and before even then they 'll come within hailing distance , speaking distance , murmuring distance . Here in the middle of the middle of the story , as she re-emerges from under the canopy of cherry blossoms into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky to snatch a small fish from the shallows . They both turn to look . He , the nearer , can see the fish flip vainly in the raptor 's talons ; the osprey aligns its prey adroitly fore and aft , head to wind , to minimize drag , and flaps off with it toward its rickety treetop nest across the pond or lake . <p> The fish is dying . The fish is dying . The fish is dead . <p> When he was a small boy being driven in his parents ' car to something he feared  --  a piano recital for which he felt unready , a medical procedure that might hurt , some new town or neighborhood that the family was moving to  --  he used to tell himself that as long as he car ride lasted , all was well , and wish it would last forever . The condemned en route to execution must feel the same , he supposes , while at the same time wanting the dread thing done with : the tumbrel has not yet arrived at the guillotine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here meanwhile is this once-pleasing avenue , this handsome small park with its central fountain , this plane tree-shaded corner where , in happier times ... <p> A gruesome image occurs to him , from his reading of Dante 's Infenzo back in college days : The Simoniacs , traffickers in sacraments and holy offices , are punished in Hell by being thrust head-downward for all eternity into holes in the infernal rock . Kneeling to speak with them in that miserable position , Dante is reminded of the similar fate of convicted assassins in his native Florence , executed by being bound hand and foot and buried alive head-down in a hole . Before that hole is filled , the officiating priest bends down as the poet is doing , to hear the condemned man 's last confession  --  which , in desperation , the poor wretch no doubt prolongs , perhaps adding fictitious sins to his factual ones in order to postpone the end ... and in so doing ( it occurs to him now , turning another trowel 's worth of soil as his wife approaches from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sin of lying , to the list yet to be confessed . <p> Distracted , he breaks off a wire-grass root . <p> " Time , " declares the Russian critic Mikhail Bakhtin , " is the true hero of every feast . " It is also the final dramaturge of every story . History is a Mandelbrot set , as infinitely subdivisible as is space in Zeno 's paradox . No interval past or future but can be partitioned and sub-partitioned , articulated down through ever finer , self-similar scales like the Koch snowflakes and infinite coastlines of fractal geometry . This intelligent , as-if-still-happy couple in late mid-story  --  what are they doing with such reflections as these but attempting unsuccessfully to kill time , as Time is unhurriedly but surely killing them ? In narrated life , even here ( halfway between cherry tree and daylily garden ) we could suspend and protract the remaining action indefinitely , without " freeze-framing " it as on Keats 's urn ; we need only slow it , delay it , atomize it , flash back in time as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where exactly on our planet are these people , for example ? What pond or lake is that beyond their pleasant lawn , its olive surface just now marbled with springtime yellow pollen ? Other than one osprey nest in a dead but still-standing oak , what is the prospect of its farther shore ? We have mentioned the man 's jeans , sweatshirt , gloves , and eyeglasses , but nothing further of his appearance , age , ethnicity , character , temperament , and history ( other than that he once attended college ) , and ( but for that same detail ) nothing whatever of hers ; nor anything , really , of their life together , its gratifications and tribulations , adventures large or small , careers , corner-turnings . Have they children ? Grandchildren , even ? What sort of telephone solicitors disturb their evidently rural peace ? What of their house 's architecture and furnishings , its past owners , if any , and the history of the land on which it sits  --  back to the last glaciation , say , which configured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Without our woman 's pausing for an instant in her hasteless but steady course across those few remaining yards of lawn , the narrative of her final steps might suspend indefinitely their completion . What variety of grasses does that lawn comprise , interspersed with what weeds , habitating what Insecra , and visited by what birds ? How , exactly , does the spring air feel on her sober-visaged face ? Are his muscles sore from gardening , and , if so , is that degree of soreness , from that source , agreeable to him or otherwise ? What is the relevance , if any , of their uncertainty whether that water beyond their lawn is properly to be denominated a large pond or a small lake , and has that uncertainty been a running levity through their years there ? Is yonder osprey 's nest truly rickety , or only apparently so ? The middle of this story nears its end , but has not reached it yet , not yet . There 's time still , still world enough and time . There are narrative possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this story is three-fourths told , it is not yet seven-eighths told ; if seven-eighths , not yet fifteen-sixteenths ; et cetera , et cetera  --  and meanwhile , meanwhile it is as if all were still well . <p> In non-narrated life , alas , it is a different story , as in the world of actual tortoises , times , and coastlines . It might appear that in Time 's infinite sub-segmentation , 11:00 A.M. can never reach 11:30 , far less noon ; it might appear that Achilles can never reach the tortoise , nor any story its end , nor any news its destined hearer  --  yet reach it : they do , in the world we know . Stories attain their denouement by selective omission , as do real-world coastline measurements ; Achilles swiftly overtakes the tortoise by ignoring the terms of Zeno 's paradox . Time , however , more wonderful than these , omits nothing , ignores nothing , yet moves inexorably from hour to hour in just five dozen minutes . <p> The story of our life is not our life ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news . <p> Our lives are not stories . Now she must tell him the news . <p> This story will never end .
