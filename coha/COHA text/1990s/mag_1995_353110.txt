LIEUT . COLONEL MATT URBAN , 75 , World War II hero ; in Holland , Michigan . Urban 's World War II exploits across the European theater ultimately earned him more combat decorations than any other soldier in American history , including the Medal of Honor and seven Purple Hearts for wounds received in combat , like the bullet that tore out a vocal cord and left him raspy-voiced to the end of his days . He led a milder civilian life as a recreation director . <P> DIED . MORRIS BERNARD ZALE , 93 , retailer ; in Dallas . Born into poverty in Russia , Zale grew prosperous mass-marketing jewelry in America through his string of 1,200 Zale 's stores , where credit lines and other come-ons sold luxury to the less affluent . <P> DIED . EDWARD L. BERNAYS , 103 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernays , the Thomas Edison of American p.r. , actually promoted Thomas Edison in the course of a long career that began in earnest when Bernays set up shop in 1919 . Now regarded as the virtual inventor of modern public relations , he promoted Enrico Caruso , Ivory soap , Henry Ford , World War I , hairnets , various projects for every President from Coolidge to Eisenhower , the color green ( at the request of Lucky Strike cigarettes , concerned that women were resisting the green packaging because it clashed with their clothes ) and Time Inc . Along the way , Bernays developed many now commonplace opinion-shaping strategies , including celebrity endorsements and the use of surveys and polling data , both for research and as selling points in their own right . As his reputation grew , so did his opinion of his profession , which he referred to , in a slightly Orwellian coinage , as " the engineering of consent . "
