In 1972 Spring Hill was as safe a neighborhood as you could find near an East Coast city , one of those instant subdivisions where brick split-levels and two-car garages had been planted like cabbages on squares of quiet green lawn . Occasionally somebody 's Schwinn bicycle was stolen , or a dog was hit by a car that kept on going . Once in a while we heard about a shoplifter at the Spring Hill Mall , six blocks away . But otherwise both the mall and the neighborhood always struck everyone as the most ordinary of places . Then one summer evening around five-thirty , just as business at the mall had finished for the day , a florist named Miss Evelyn Crespo carried a box of orchid corsages out to her car for a wedding that night . She had parked far back behind the mall in a row of spaces reserved for employees , below a two-acre wooded rise . That time of day , the mall 's triangular shadow cut upward across the hill like a wedge . As Miss Crespo slid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought was a cat mewing from the shaded half of the hillside . The sun was in her eyes when she backed away from the car to look around . After a moment , the mewing came again , or something like it , a small , weak sound . Although she was a heavy woman , and the day was hot , she climbed partway up the rise toward where it flattened out , wading through the broken bottles , locust husks , and tangled creeper vines to see if the source of the mewing might be somebody 's lost kitten . When she did n't find anything , she carefully edged back down toward the parking lot , once grabbing the branch of a laurel bush forsupport . Then she went inside the mall , locked up her shop for the night , waved to the hairdressers in the Klip ' n ' Kurl hair salon , came out through the automatic glass doors to her car carrying the bridal bouquet , and drove off to Bethesda to deliver her wedding flowers . The whole experience lasted no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crespo was to recount the details of those ten minutes over and over in the next few weeks , first to the Montgomery County police officers who came to question her , then to a police detective , then to three newspaper reporters , later to her family and neighbors , and finally to her customers , who came into the shop to lean against her refrigerated display case of long-stemmed roses , tiger lilies , and baby 's breath . She described those ten minutes so frequently she grew sick of the sound of her own voice . She also ceased believing that the details she recounted were true , which happens when you tell a story about yourself so often the words are memorized . Because what Miss Crespo had heard that mid-July evening was not a kitten mewing , but a young boy groaning behind a clump of laurel bushes , where not twenty minutes before he had been raped by a man who had also tried to choke him to death . In her police report , part of which was published in the Post , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that afternoon . To her knowledge , none of the other store owners had seen anything unusual , either ; most of them reported serving regular customers that day . However , an elderly woman walking her dog on Ridge Road near the big brick U.S. Defense facility did testify to seeing a boy talking to a man in a car just before five o'clock ; the man , she thought , was balding , but she could n't recall the color or make of the car . A bag boy at the Safeway , who was breaking down cardboard boxes outside by the Dumpster , heard a car skid out of the parking lot around five-thirty and looked up to see the taillights of a brown coupe , possibly a Dodge , or so he thought when presented with drawings of different car silhouettes . Neither the florist nor anyone else saw a man with a boy , and no one had seen anyone on the hillside that day . It was Thursday , the 20th of July . The child 's name was Boyd Arthur Ellison . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police by describing his attacker because by the time he was found very early the next morning , his attacker had come back and finished what he 'd started . As the Post 's reporter later reconstructed events , the man who killed Boyd Ellison had seen the florist when she came out to her car with the box of flowers . Ducking and scrambling , he fled to a bushy stand of white pine farther behind the mall . From a distance , he must have watched her place the box on the back seat , watched her stiffen as she heard a noise . He must have watched her back away from the car , shade her eyes , and look up the hill , then make her slow way over the curb and up through the creeper , her broad face perspiring in the late-afternoon sunlight as she paused to listen again . She had run her nylon stockings in her search ; she kept them to show the police . He must have seen her bend down with an irritated exclamation and lift her skirt hem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to the police report , she had stepped within five yards of the boy ; if she had turned slightly left , if she had looked carefully , she might have seen one of his bare shins , his foot in a white gym sock , half buried in leaves . But Miss Crespo was nearsighted . One of her small vanities was to avoid wearing her glasses in public . Even if she had turned left , even if she had looked , she might still have missed seeing the boy 's bruised leg . What she should not have missed seeing , although perhaps she never brought herself to admit it to the police , was a boy 's black basketball sneaker , unlaced , which had tumbled down the hill and lay in the gutter under the curb , only a few inches from the front tires of her car . At the inquest , Boyd 's parents , Walter and Sylvia Ellison , both testified that the morning of their son 's death imitated every summer morning of his life . His mother woke him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father before Walter left for work at eight . According to what I remember , it was a bright , hot morning . According to what I imagine , the family had breakfast on their screened porch , as most of our neighbors liked to do in the summer . Like most fathers , Walter Ellison would have skimmed the newspaper while he ate his grapefruit . Boyd drank a glass of orange juice , ate an English muffin with raspberry jam and a soft-boiled egg from a china eggcup designed to look like a chick with an eggshell on its head . While he waited for his egg , he told his father about the book he was reading , The Call of the Wild , which my brother had read the summer before . Walter finished his toast , drank a glass of milk , kissed Boyd good-bye , and told his wife he would be home at the usual time . Then he kissed her good-bye , too , and left for work . At six-fifteen , just as he was about to leave his office at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife saying that she could n't find Boyd . He had n't come home after she 'd sent him to the mall at four for a packet of straight pins and a carton of sherbet . Walter told her to phone the police and said he would be there as soon as he could . It was Walter who found him . With over fifty men from the neighborhood , Walter had searched all night , swinging a flashlight under people 's hedges , behind garages , through backyards , calling and calling and calling . The neighborhood men divided up into search parties of three or four , and each group sent runners periodically to find out if the other groups had discovered anything . Walter 's group had picked across the mall 's parking lot and found the black sneaker , but twice went right up the hillside past where the boy lay . Only the third time , as the sun was coming up , did they see himdid his father see him . He got down on his knees and tried to cover the boy with himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call an ambulance from the pay phone beside the mall . Walter told the man who stayed with him that he thought he felt his son 's heartbeat . But that was impossible , the coroner said later ; the boy had been dead more than eleven hours by then . When the ambulance shrieked into the parking lot to take Boyd 's body down MacArthur Boulevard to Sibley Hospital , no one had yet discovered the three-pound , conical piece of limestone , lying a few feet away under a laurel bush , that had been used to smash in the back of his skull . All his father knew , as he pressed his son against his chest and imagined the beating of his heart , was that he had been found . CHAPTER TWO Why I recall that particular grisly incident so exactly has something to do with my age at the time , and something more to do with what my family was going through that summer , and also with the fact that I knew , very slightly , the boy who had been murdered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fanatic vigilance I practiced back then . If you ask my mother what I was like as a child , she 'll tell you that I was one of those little girls who never said much but who was always there , especially during fights . At every spat , every loud argument , every disagreement in the grocery store check-out line , there you 'd find me , looking on . Though small for my age , I was the first one to push inside the circle during playground brawls , just out of range of the kicking and flailing , but right up close so that I could see everything . Later on in my bedroom I 'd replay the scene , repeating bits of dialogue in front of my mirror , examining each insult and shove to figure out why it had happened . I always wanted a reason . " Why ? " I asked my mother , my father , anyone who would listen . " Why did it happen ? " I was fascinated by how people managed to hurt one another , by what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinated ; my interest in those days was mechanistic : I wanted the mainspring , the wheels and teeth . So it 's not surprising that although Boyd Ellison 's killer has never been foundone of those unfinished stories that sometimes happen in lifeas a child I was so anxious to discover him that for a while I almost believed I knew who he was . But to tell that story I need to tell this one , which is less sensational , except perhaps to those who have lived through something like it . One cold February evening , as we were all sitting at the dinner table eating pork chops and mashed potatoes and speculating on whether it would snow , and whether if it did snow it would snow enough that the Maryland schools would close the next day , my mother suddenly turned to my father , who had been staring out the window , and said in a conversational tone , " I know you know I know . " She might have opened her mouth to ask him to pass the butter , but another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought at the time . Without understanding what my mother was talking about , I recognized a clutch of implications . What did she know ? And how could my father know she " knew " something and yet have to be reminded he had such information ? As the youngest of three children , I was used to being unenlightened during dinner-table conversations . I went on eating my pork chop . But it was impossible to ignore what happened next . My mother picked up her plate and , with a snap of her wrist , sailed it like a Frisbee straight across the dining room . China shattered . Mashed potatoes and gravy splattered against the wall and onto the blue carpet and sprayed my father 's white shirt with grease spots . One half-eaten pork chop landed on top of the china cabinet . It was an absurd and terrible moment , and in the way of such moments , also cinematicwith that pork chop balanced on top of the china cabinet and my family staring up at it with open mouths , which made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she wanted to laugh . Her eyelids crinkled and the corner of her mouth jerked up . But the next instant she reached over and one after another sent my brother 's , my sister 's , and my own plate spinning . " I wo n't pretend I do n't know , " she said . Then she stood up and left the room . We watched the kitchen 's swinging door swing behind her . My father was still holding his fork . Of course , for many people who grew up in the ' 70s , childhood was spent between parents , rather than with them . If parents did n't actually divorce , they certainly thought about it , often out loud , and sometimes requested their children 's advice I 've heard horror stories about Christmases spent in airports , scenes at high school graduations , photo albums with one parent or the other scissored out . I 've heard so many of these stories that they 're no longer remarkablein fact , they have stopped being stories at all and have turned into cliches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the father remarries a witch who dislikes his children and turns him against them ; the mother remarries a brute who likes her daughters too much . But any cliche has a fact for a heart , and the fact is that marriages , like political alliances , broke up all over this country in the 1970s , which in the latter case at least had never happened before . The cause of my own parents ' divorce was predictable enough . My father began seeing another woman . What spins their story in a slightly different direction is that the other woman happened to be my mother 's younger sister , her favorite sister , Ada . My mother never much trusted men . In her opinion , they lacked character . When she was seven her own father died of pneumonia after falling asleep drunk on a Baltimore park bench in the snow , leaving his wife with four little girls and no life insurance . They moved in with my mother 's grandparents , who were well-to-do , but six months later her grandfather had a stroke and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brass headboard with his good hand . It was soon revealed that he , too , had neglected to prepare for anyone 's future , and after paying off the night nurses and the funeral bills , six females found themselves close to broke just as World War II was ending . They managed . The two women took in sewing , did some typing , ate corn flakes for dinner , and , with a loan from a great-aunt , finally moved to Bethesda and opened a gift shop that specialized in Hummel china figurines . My mother says she and her sisters grew up tough and sober , qualities they believed their male forebears had lacked . While they dusted those porcelain shepherd boys and goose girls , they planned how to be unbreakable . " Always pay for your own movie on a date , " they told one another sternly . " Never say thank you unless you mean it . Get respect . " Their loyalties lay strictly with one another , especially when it came to men . They knew how fragile men could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a palpitation . Had n't they seen it ? Males , they confided , carried diseases . Sitting cross-legged on their beds at night , they demonstrated for one another how to kiss boys with lips sealed shut . Wear an undershirt and a bra , the older ones instructed the younger ones . Be prepared . My grandmother used to say she had given birth to one daughter with four heads , an uncomfortable image that seems unlikely coming from the plump old lady I remember dozing by the radiator in her brown wool slacks and pink fur house slippers . But the image was true enough in its way . My mother and her sisters liked to exact unified vengeance when one of them was mistreated , usually by way of carefully orchestrated , malicious jokes . In one story my mother liked to tell , her sister Claire dated a boy who then lied to his friends about having sex with her in the back of his father 's car . Two days later , the results of this boy 's yearly physical examination , signed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infirmary and appeared on a bulletin board . The report graphically detailed the boy 's unfortunate condition as a hermaphrodite and recommended surgical intervention . I have forgotten which sister forged this document , but apparently the forgery was so excellent that no one believed it was a fake until the school nurse stood up during an assembly and declared she 'd had nothing to do with it . My mother and her sisters always figured in these stories as a hilarious , vindictive sorority : Fran , Claire , Lois , and Ada , the fabulous Mayhew girlsfunny , brazen , compassionate , and ruthless , a private female army . The Mayhew Girls , that 's how I thought of them . Like the title of a book . My mother and her sisters were all very tall , which may be why the fast put-down happened to be their particular talent . " This big , " they would say , holding a thumb and forefinger two inches apart when some miscreant boy passed by . It was left to him to decide if they meant a specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I still imagine them in these stories , the Mayhew Girls are always dressed in nunnish black ankle-length skirts , white blouses , and seductive , shiny patent-leather pumps . They wear red lipstick , but their underwear is sewn by their mother out of old linen pillowcases . They smoke cigarettes and toss around slangy phrases like " Hey , Daddy-o " and " Catch you on the flip side " ; yet they perform brilliantly in Latin , shouting lines from Virgil in the bathtub , writing " panis " instead of " bread " on grocery lists , quizzing one another on verb conjugations while they pluck their eyebrows . Like my grandmother , I had a hard time as a child separating one aunt from another . In my mother 's stories , virtually no separation existed . Of course , that was my mother 's story . The true story , if there is such a thing , must hover somewhere closer to misery . The fifties were n't a time to be odd , and four lumbering girls with no father and pillowcase underwear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely they stuck together because they felt left out of any other group they tried to join . Their devotion to one another was defensive , reflexive , parochial . Us/them . Which is probably why they exaggerated so cruelly about one another . " Claire called the other day , " my mother might tell Ada as they sat at the kitchen table stirring their coffee . " I had to listen for two hours while she complained about how much the dog sheds . Why do n't you just harvest the damn thing , ' I said . Make it into an afghan . ' Well , you know Claire " Or she might hang up the phone from talking to Aunt Fran and immediately dial Ada 's number to say , " Listen to this , I just talked to Frannie . She 's bought a new Sears dishwasherwell , you know her , you 'd think she 'd bought the Waldorf-Astoria . Why do n't you just move into it , ' I said . It sounds a lot fancier than your house ' " Naturally my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as saying . Maybe Aunt Claire had complained briefly about the dog 's shedding ; maybe Aunt Fran boasted for a moment about her dishwasher . But for my mother to render these details realistically would be to miss a chance of celebrating her latticelike relationship to her sisters . She loved to talk about one sister with derogatory intimacy to another . And whatever self-criticism she was likely to entertain she also leveled at them , so that she was continually admiring her own flaws in the others . " We 're all touchy , " she might say proudly . " You know us . " The only one who sometimes escaped this X-ray attention was Ada . Ada was the baby of the family , even several inches shorter than the other three . As a child she had been unusually self-absorbed and was therefore considered artistic . She spent hours in her room with scissors and a pile of magazines , cutting out movie stars and pasting them into little booklets she made out of stapled construction paper . The movie stars were then given bits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is n't Ada the cat 's pajamas ? " Rita Hayworth asks David Niven in the one booklet that survives . " Is n't she the bee 's knees ? " In keeping with her artistic nature , Ada seemed more exotic to me than my mother or my other aunts . She had grown her hair long , when most women her age wore bubble cuts and shags . Her hair was a bright auburn and she liked to sweep it back from her forehead with her hands and bunch it between her fists . She had a fondness for silver bangle bracelets that clinked whenever she swept back her hair , and when she laughed her eyes disappeared . Privately , I believed , or hoped , that I resembled her ; in fact , my hair is the same color , although curlier . But Ada was always different from the rest of the family , and it was n't simply that she was more attractive . She not only looked soft , ripe , and pliant , and seemed to feel that way , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anybody . Her laugh was slow and full ; her gestures were languid , even when she meant to be in a hurry . Her arms plumped near her shoulders , and under her flimsy embroidered peasant blouses , her full breasts swayed , braless . My mother and aunts could be self-critical to the point of paralysis , but not Ada . Ada liked how she looked . I 've known a few women like that since , who truly think they are beautiful or sexy and become so , even if they 're plain , and I 've always been a little afraid of them , as my mother and her older sisters sometimes seemed a little afraid of Ada . Sexual preoccupation is an imperious thing , and when it 's in full color , it makes all other preoccupations look slightly beside the point . Oddly enough , my mother felt protective about Ada . " Oh , she 's had a lot on her mind , " she would argue if Fran or Claire accused Ada of laziness when she failed to send Christmas presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiration for vanity , for its vividness , the way scrupulous people can admire hucksters . " You know Ada , " she would say with a laugh . " She 's a little distracted by herself " And until the year Boyd Ellison was murdered , the sight of Aunt Ada in our kitchen , long hair curling loose down her back , sitting at the Formica table doodling on a paper napkin while my mother made dinner , was as familiar to me as the sight of my own brother or sister . Ada had accepted her role as the family artist and , with financial help from her older sisters , had gone to art school for a year before dropping out to marry Uncle Roger , who managed a steakhouse in Bethesda called The Flaming Pit . Ada taught art classes at an elementary school in Rockville . She had no children of her own . " It 's Little Miss Marsha , the Martian Girl , " she always said when I came home from school ; then she asked me what was " new . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often drew a picture of what I described . When I was finished talking , she 'd hand me the napkin . If I had done well on a quiz , she drew a crown . If another child had hurt my feelings , she drew a picture of that child being pierced by arrows or getting run over by a truck . " Come on , Ada , " my mother sometimes said . " That 's not nice . " " Come on yourself , Ada would laugh , sweeping back her hair . But most of all I remember her smell , a disturbing smell , provocative , fruityI can smell it now just thinking about ita smell something like moist apricots . Sometimes when she spoke she would hood her upper lip like a horse trying to nibble a carrot . Of all the sisters , she had married first , at eighteen . " Well , you know Ada , " said my mother , when anyone asked why . I mention all this history as a roundabout way of saying that despite the natural resentment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe my mother loved her sister Ada more than she loved my father . Simply , she trusted her . She trusted her as one trusts someone fully comprehended , which may not be a good idea as there is no such thing . Ada was a safeguard , an ally , part of my mother 's future plan , which she had learned early to prepare and maintain . Her betrayal was far more shocking to my mother than my father 's betrayal , which she had always more or less expected . In all the cruel , elaborate jokes they crafted together , my mother never imagined a sister would play one on her . Two days after that cold February evening when my mother sailed our plates through the air , Aunt Fran and Aunt Claire arrived for a visit . They appeared at the front door clad in nearly identical outfits of pastel blouses and tweedy slacks , and Aunt Fran was wearing desert boots . They were leggy , stoop-shouldered women , edging past forty , with short toast-colored hair and worried brown eyes , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tallest , with a big jaw and a skinny neck . Aunt Claire had kindly , popped eyes , which made her look like a Boston terrier . Every time my mother told one of her Mayhew Girls stories , I always pictured Fran and Claire as elegantly insouciant , the sort of women who made wisecracks and wore scarlet lipstick , who drank martinis and did n't eat the olive , who could sprint in high-heeled shoes . Every time I saw them , I had to remember all over again how ordinary they looked ; but this time their ordinariness seemed deliberate . Aunt Fran carried both of their plaid suitcases , while Aunt Claire toted along an enormous half-finished needlepoint of the Eiffel Tower with a leftward tilt . As they strode toward the house from the car , they looked like a matched set of army nurses . " Hi , kids , " they shouted as they stepped through the door , in rough sweet voices that might have demanded hospital corners and sterilized gauze . When Aunt Fran bent to kiss me , a sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wintergreen Life Savers . " For you , " she murmured , slipping into my pocket a bag of sourballs . That night my sister and I slept in sleeping bags on the floor of my brother 's room to free up enough beds . Suddenly our house filled with raspy whispering female voices , a sibilant , maddening sound to a child who is afraid to know why her father drives off to work red-eyed every morning , while her mother spends her mornings vacuuming ferociously , up and down the stairs , through every room , her mouth set like a gladiator 's . My father had confessed . Why or how I do not know ; my mother has never said , and she is not easy to question . But apparently during this time an attempt was made " to work things out . " Ada stayed banished in her brick townhouse in Bethesda , painting watercolors of fleshy peaches and pears , while her two eldest sisters drove back and forth in our Oldsmobile station wagon bearing messages , conferring , theorizing , solemn as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Aunt Fran had left her husband and son in Milwaukee , and Aunt Claire had left her two daughters and her husband in Detroit . As difficult an occasion as it must have been for them , it was still a vacation . They bought packs of Kools as soon as they arrived , though both had quit smoking , and drank white wine before dinner . After dinner they draped their long legs across the sofa , displaying at last a hint of insouciance , and blew perfect smoke rings at the ceiling . The rest of the time Aunt Claire stitched at her pillow while Aunt Fran hunkered onto the floor to do stretching exercises , their hoarse voices hoarsening as time went on , and during the day they persuaded my mother to go shopping for shoes . At least , I remember her , during that period , wearing several pairs of new platform shoes , which looked like hooves . My aunts took turns corralling the twins and me into the station wagon as soon as we got home from school to herd us off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we would buy chewing gum and jawbreakers from the drugstore , then wander past shop windows , stepping on the heels of one another 's sneakers , snickering at the negligees in the window of the Coy Boutique , always ending up at the pet shop to watch the tropical fish avoid each other in their aquariums . This diversion was to give my mother more time to " talk " to the aunt who had remained behind . But when we returned , she would be sitting silently on a kitchen stool , staring at the gold flecks in the Formica tabletop . Perhaps the twins and I talked about our parents among ourselves that week . Perhaps one night I cornered my sister , Julie , and asked her what she thought was happening . But I do n't think I ever did . She and Steven had each other for confidantesthey were twins after all , and at fourteen plunged into intrigues with each other and their friends that I found unfathomable until I got to be fourteen myself . Also Julie despised me . Whenever I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a lisping voice . She had a passion for British novels in those days and had adopted an affected Oxford tone straight out of Evelyn Waugh , which made every nasty thing she said sound even nastier . " The Child , " she and Steven called me , " Marsha the Swamp , " or simply " Swamp . " My aunts spent hours talking to my mother . Their voices sailed out from the living room , swooping back to a whisper if my mother reminded them we might be listening , only to rise again , flapping upward like shorebirds . When she arrived , Aunt Claire had given me a conch shell from Bermuda . I remember being embarrassed by the shell 's glossy pink interior , which looked to me like an exaggerated version of my mother 's broad upper lip . My mother had never had what you could properly call a harelip , but her lip was wide and gently peaked at the top . " Go on , " said Aunt Claire , when I hesitated to press my ear next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " From then on the cloistral roar of the conch shell was what I always imagined when I passed the living room and heard my aunts ' voices . They both thought my mother should give my father time , that he needed to get " it " out of his system . " Not that we 're excusing her " they often said , sometimes in unison . " Do n't think that for a minute . You know us . " Vigorously they nodded their cropped , delicate-looking heads . Who knows why my father decided to stay in the house during that week . Perhaps he thought it was a show of strength or , more likely , an act of atonement . In the early mornings before he left for work , and in the evenings after he got home , my father drifted through the house like smoke from my aunts ' cigarettes . He played " As Time Goes By " and the easier parts of " Moonlight Sonata " before dinner on our upright piano in the living room ; but now he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , and he made more mistakes than usual . In the evenings after dinner he mixed Scotch and milk in a Flintstones glass and drank it standing up by the refrigerator . Sometimes he paced back and forth on our screened porch . More often he disappeared . I began hunting him through the house even after I was supposed to be in bed , finding him in odd places like the basement near the boiler or in the kitchen hovering by the back door . Late one night I found him standing outside his own bedroom . " Hi there , " he said . He looked like someone waiting to be called into the dentist 's office . We stood a few moments together , examining the hallway 's orange carpet with its rushing pattern that always reminded me of goldfish swimming upstream . Here and there the carpet had worn thin in places ; some of the goldfish had nearly vanished . " You know , " my father murmured , looking at the carpet and twisting a button on his cuff . " You know a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes . Not about you , though . None of this is about you , sweetheart . " He smiled at me sadly . " So you just keep on with what you were doing , Marsha honey . Do whatever you need to do . " " But I was n't doing anything , I said . " That 's all right . " He seemed anxious to reassure me , but uncertain about the direction this reassurance should take . That night , cross-legged on my bed in my pink nightgown , I wrote him a note on a strip of notebook paper . " Hi , Dad . This is from your daughter Marsha . Bet you 're surprised to find a note in your pocket . I just wanted to say you do whatever you need to do , too ! " This last bit did n't sound quite right , but I could n't think how to change it and I was suddenly very tired , so I stumbled downstairs and slipped the note into his overcoat . A night or two later , I sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father and the twins . I had been sitting close to my father 's armchair , holding his hand by the wrist , when halfway through the show I suddenly felt I had to see my mother . I wanted her in that way of very young children , a muddled , weepy kind of lust . I searched first in the kitchen , then in the basement , finding traces of her everywherea coffee cup with lipstick prints , a crumpled tissue . Finally , as I padded into the dark upstairs hallway in my stocking feet , I heard first her voice and then my aunts ' as they talked in her bedroom . From what I could hear , they were getting ready to trim one another 's hair , and Aunt Claire was proposing to give my mother a henna rinse in the bathroom . " Take off your blouse , " one of them ordered . My parents ' bedroom door had been hung backward , so that it opened into the hallway ; it stood partly ajar , and almost without thinking , I stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have to face up to the situation , " Aunt Claire was saying . " Confront it . Then you have to go on . " " That 's easy for you to say , " said my mother . " Of course it is , " said Aunt Claire . " But it 's still true . " " What you have to do , " Aunt Fran said , " is forget about dignity . " " Believe me , " said my mother . " Dignity is about the last thing on my mind these days . " I edged around so that I could squint through the crack between the hinges and the doorjamb , hoping , and fearing , but hoping more intensely , that my aunts would take off their clothes . I believed they would still be wearing that pillowcase underwear I had heard about , and I wanted to see what it looked likeI even pulled my glasses out of my pocket and put them on in anticipation of this possibility . I was also interested in seeing their breasts , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's what breasts looked like in Steven 's drawings , which he hid under his bed . He called them " tooties " Why I assumed my mother 's breasts , glimpsed occasionally in her bedroom or in the women 's changing room of our community pool , were not " tooties , " I 'm not sure , except that nothing belonging to my mother seemed unusual to me then , or seemed to belong to anyone but her . My mother and my aunts abruptly stopped talking , and for an instant I thought they had seen me behind the door . But then they began again , talking now with the stiff casualness of people who are forced off a subject that interests them . " It 'll give you a lift , " Aunt Claire told my mother , standing close behind her . She ran her fingers slowly up the back of my mother 's hair while they both stared at themselves in the mirror over the dresser . " Auburn highlights . That 's all it is . " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aunt Fran sat down on the edge of the bed and pulled off her sneakers . " You have the cutest figure , Lois , " she said , smiling at my mother 's back . " Really . What a nice little package . " She leaned over and gave my mother a swat on the bottom . Staring gravely at herself in the mirror , my mother turned her head from side to side , Aunt Claire 's fingers still sifting her hair . " You do n't think I 'll look silly ? " Aunt Claire slid her hand out of my mother 's hair and let it rest loosely on her shoulder . " You 'll look beautiful . You look beautiful now . " " Ha , " said my mother . " Oh , you do n't know . " Aunt Fran pushed her green tweed slacks down around her hips . She stood up to wriggle them down to her knees , then stepped out of them and left them crumpled on the floor . She wore plain white underwear , a fringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric at the top of each of her legs . As she unbuttoned her blouse , I could see the front of her brassiere , a bit of lacy panel . She let her blouse hang open and sat back down on the bed , crossing her legs . " You 've always been the beautiful one . " " I am not , " said my mother , but she smiled a little into the mirror , one corner of her broad lip lifting . " Much more beautiful than Ada , " said Aunt Claire . " Ada 's getting fat , " said Aunt Fran , gazing again at her own long , muscular legs . " I do n't want to talk about Ada " My mother moved away from Aunt Claire and headed toward the bathroom , out of my sight . Aunt Claire raised her eyebrows at Aunt Fran , who shrugged . " Take off your blouse and skirt " Aunt Claire called after my mother . " And bring out the scissors . We 'll trim your hair first while the henna dissolves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed next to Aunt Fran and began unbuttoning her own blouse . " All I want is about an inch off the ends . How much do you want ? " " Oh I do n't care . I had my hair cut last week . I 'm just doing it to be part of things . " Aunt Claire smiled as she pulled off her blouse . She was n't wearing a brassiere at all . Instead of the two cones I 'd been expecting , a pair of small , flattened-looking eyes confronted me , oatmeal-colored save for the brown , protruding , button irisbizarre , almost horrible , plain human flesh . Aunt Fran had now taken off her blouse and was standing by the bed in her bra and white underpants . She looked like a giraffe , she was so tall and sinewy , so unnaturally unencumbered as she shifted from one leg to another , flexing her leg muscles , her smallish , sleek head lifting suddenly , blinking at the sight of herself in the mirror . On the bed , Aunt Claire leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee-high nylon stockings . Her pale back was spattered like a dog 's belly with large brownish freckles . She sat up again and fluffed the back of her hair with one hand , yawning , then looked toward the bathroom . " Lo ? " she called . " Are you ready ? " Both of my aunts sighed as my mother came suddenly back into view . She was wearing a green towel around her head ; otherwise she was completely naked . It was a surprisingly sad thing to see my mother naked . I had seen her naked before , but not , it seemed to me , for a long time , and certainly not in this way . She looked diminished and ribby and whiteand unexpectedly hairy . She also looked on display , like a store mannequin waiting to be dressed . A thin , pinkish scar I remembered but had forgotten sliced along her lower belly , ending in a grim bristle of hair . Was this what my father saw when he looked at her at night in their bedroom ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her scar . He would be afraid ; he would curl his fingers back at the last moment . And I guessed that this scar must be the root of their trouble , their fighting , their silence , that my mother 's body should have been perfect , as mine was perfect . She put one hand on her hip , one on the doorjamb , and waited . " Why look at you , cried Aunt Fran . " Venus on the half shell . " My mother smiled blankly . The lenses of my glasses fogged up . I closed my eyes and counted twice to one hundred by tens . When I stopped counting , my mother had gone back into the bathroom . The very next night I was sitting on my mother 's bed with her and Aunt Claire , when my mother abruptly got up and flung open the bedroom closet where my father 's suits hung neatly on the rod . " I guess we should think about giving these old clothes away , " she said . Perhaps I imagined it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , shifting back down to the kitchen . " Lo , " said Aunt Claire . " This is n't the way to handle it " " Tell me another way , " said my mother , tightening her lips . By then she was already referring to my father in the past tense . " Larry used to like that show , " she might say if we were all in the living room trying to watch television . He would look up and lightly shudder . " Larry always ate his grapefruit after he finished his coffee , " she might tell my aunts at the breakfast table , " because if he had them together he said they left a moldy aftertaste . " And there my father would be , holding his coffee cup , his grapefruit untouched in front of him . Once she got going , she could n't stop . The fast put-down . The cruel , humorous revenge . Having the Mayhew Girls in the house inspired her . " It ca n't be sex she wants him for , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my aunts ' visit , just as my father was leaving for his office . " That thing has n't had batteries for years . " The twins smirked nervously at each other . " Lois . " Aunt Fran pointed her big chin at me over the cereal boxes . " Oh , they do n't even know what sex is , " said my mother . " Lois , " said Aunt Claire . But my mother had already added : " They 're his kids , after all . " And then from the doorway , my father said , " That 's enough . " We all looked up . He was standing in his dark blue overcoat , his hat in his hand lifted halfway to his head so that it looked as though he were doffing his hat to my mother . My note must still have been in the pocket of that coat ; as soon as he put his hand in his pocket , he would feel it rustle against his fingers , slender as a fortune from a fortune cookie . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grows greenish and dense ; a shadow blows across the kitchen windows , darkening the room . From a street away , a dog begins to bark . In the flat chill of that morning , sound carries acutely ; the dog could be barking in our own kitchen . Someone yells at the dog to shut up . The dog barks louder . My father continues to stand in the doorway , still in his attitude either of leave-taking or congratulation , or perhaps supplication , his hat cradled in his hand . The shadow blows past ; sunlight washes back through the windows ; the dog stops barking . My father stares at my mother , and she stares back . " That 's enough , he says . And in a reasonable , almost pleasant voice my mother says , " I agree . " Corruption By TAHAR BEN JELLOUN THE NEW PRESS TAILER
