<p> Terence Trent D'Arby , " Symphony Or Damn " ( Columbia ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) 1/2 <p> As gangbusters go , few pop artists have come on as blazingly as the New York-born , London-transplanted wunderkind Terence Trent D'Arby . With a cockiness that spilled into egomania and an ambition that translated into pretentiousness , the multi-instrumentalist set himself up as the new Prince with his 1987 debut , " Introducing the Hardline According to Terence Trent D'Arby . " <p> It took him two albums to reign in his ego , pare back the excess and find his focus , but he 's done those things more rewardingly than anyone could have expected . In terms of pure songcraft , there has n't been an album released this year that surpasses " Symphony or Damn . " It simply does n't have a weak cut , which , considering its 65-minute length and the galaxy of styles D'Arby pilots through , is saying something . <p> For the first time , the 31-year-old D'Arby sounds relaxed with his prodigious musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rundgren ) and the spirits of his many heroes . Sam Cooke , the Isley Brothers and Stevie Wonder are among the soul legends who figure prominently in his style ( Stevie should consider covering the irridescent " Delicate , " featuring vocals by Des'ree ) . <p> Beatlesque flourishes , hard funk , country music and gospel also infuse his shadowy romanticism . D'Arby 's thematic depth is limited , but he makes up for that with irresistible hooks and ingenious arrangements . <p> Lloyd Sachs <p> " Gethsemane , " Michael McDermott ( SBK ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) <p> Michael McDermott kicks off his latest CD with the line , " I was looking for something different . " With " From Chicago to Gethsemane , " the Chicago-based singer-songwriter does just that , veering from the everyman vignettes painted on his debut album " 620 W. Surf " to seductive tales of exotic places that are n't necessarily far from home . <p> That he chose to cite a biblical reference in his album title is n't surprising , considering McDermott once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less about religion than achieving inner peace . It may sound like a New Age mantra , but the pieces fit together surprisingly well . <p> Produced by Don Dixon ( R.E.M . and Marti Jones ) , " Gethsemane " showcases incendiary rock ' n ' roll guitars without sacrificing McDermott 's vocals . As evident on cuts such as " Just West of Eden , " he is a storyteller , but he is not the Springsteen of the Generation X set . A refined romantic , McDermott writes lyrics that range from quaint poetry to sharp prose . <p> Where his debut album showed off his potential , this collection realizes his dream . <p> Jae-Ha Kim <p> " The Best of Lobo , " Lobo ( Rhino ) ( STAR ) 1/2 <p> Long before Los Lobos , there was just Lobo . A former sideman with the late Gram Parsons in the early 1960s , Roland Kent LaVoie took the name Lobo to help market 1971 's " Me and You and a Dog Named Boo , " his first hit . <p> Rhino Records has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " which is peculiar because I only recall Lobo having a handful of hits . But all the Lobo classics are here : the take that ballad " Do n't Expect Me to Be Your Friend , " " I 'd Love You to Want Me " and " She Did n't Do Magic . " <p> Lobo did have a keen sense of melody , but that had been played out by the summer of 1973 , with the hit " How Can I Tell Her , " which he considers the best song he ever wrote . His hits were produced by Phil Gernhard ( of " Snoopy and the Red Baron " fame ) with keen minimalism . <p> Lobo turned 50 on Saturday . He 's depicted in Wayne Jancik 's candid liner notes as a recluse ( Lost Lobo ? ) living in the North Carolina mountains . LaVoie admits to writing some songs after drinking too much beer and adds that every time he wrote , he felt he was standing outside in his underwear . <p> " I 'm heard in elevators and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LaVoie says in the notes . " People do n't know me much or the way I look , and that 's OK . To this day , they probably think I 'm some group . " <p> Lobo , we hardly knew ye . <p> Dave Hoekstra <p> " No Little Boy , " John Martyn ( Mesa/Blue Moon ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) <p> John Martyn is a native of Glascow , Scotland , who is in the process of relocating to Chicago . He has recorded more than 20 albums and was a close friend of moody British singer-songwriter Nick Drake , who committed suicide in 1974 . <p> " No Little Boy " is Martyn 's debut for Mesa/Blue Moon . His signature is a vulnerable slur in his vocals that fall somewhere between Van Morrison and John Hiatt , and producers Jim Tullio and Matt Butler have clear empathy for Martyn 's murky style . <p> Martyn maintains that he has never sung a word in his life . Instead , he uses lyrics as an tonal entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Boy " were written at least 20 years ago by Martyn . <p> Among the standouts is a deeply mystical update of " Solid Air , " which Martyn wrote for Drake a year before he died ; " Could 've Been Me , " an edgy Phil Collins-Martyn soul summit propelled by Shaun Christopher 's smart backing vocals , and the vulnerable " One World , " featuring David Gilmour 's economical guitar work and Martyn 's tender vocals over pendulous rhythms . <p> Levon Helm 's guest harmonies on " Just Now " are worthy of note , and Chicago session veteran Chris Cameron ( Sonia Dada , Mellow Fellows , Chevere ) contributes a convincing soul groove on the Hammond B-3 organ that 's reminiscent of Helm 's R.C.O. All-Stars . The somber mood does n't fluctuate much - only one song , " Sweet Little Mystery , " is bridged with anything that resembles a lilting hook - but " No Little Boy " is real big music for the season the rains came down . <p> Dave Hoekstra <p> " Poetic Justice " soundtrack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 1/2 <p> John " Boyz N the Hood " Singleton launches Janet " Platinum-Plus " Jackson 's film career with a diverse soundtrack that leans on old pros Stevie Wonder and Stanley Clarke , along with hardcore gangsta groups Dogg Pound and 2Pac . Sandwiched in between are rhythm and blues chart-toppers such as Babyface and Tony ! Toni ! Tone . <p> Fifteen cuts deep , Singleton 's choice tracks echo the movie 's turbulent and tender themes . Many focus on the voices of young African-American women ( represented by Jackson in the film ) and the macho gangland violence that eats away at the tentative relationships spawned in the embattled neighborhoods of South Central L.A. <p> The movie introduces 14-year-old Usher Raymond , Cultural Revolution and Mista Grimm , all of whom bear watching in the days ahead based on the tracks included here . The only thing missing is a slice of spoken word from Maya Angelou , whose poetry is used in the film . Now that would have been a bonus cut . <p> Martin Keller <p> " Ottone , King of Germany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baroque Orchestra , with Drew Minter , Lisa Saffer , Juliana Gondek , Patricia Spence , Ralf Popken and Michael Dean ) ( Harmonia Mundi ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) 1/2 <p> " Ottone , King of Germany , " by George Handel ; Robert King conducts the King 's Consort , with James Bowman , Claron McFadden , Jennifer Smith , Catherine Denley , Dominique Visse and Michael George ( Hyperion ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) ( STAR ) <p> Welcome to this week 's edition of dueling " Ottones . " <p> Once upon a time , McGegan 's was the first " Ottone , " and therefore the best , since if you only have one strawberry , it will be the best you 've ever had . That 's the beauty of a premiere recording . <p> Then came Robert King 's " Ottone , " which decisively betters McGegan 's . <p> Many composers , such as Mozart , for instance , wrote some music for the royal folks and other music for the real folks , the peasants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while King 's would be the one performed in the bawdy house . Every aspect is less stuffy than McGegan 's , as King records Handel 's opera with a tense muscularity and wonderful looseness that make it a delight to hear . <p> This looseness makes King 's a more successful effort dramatically , as well . McGegan 's vocalists seem to be expending so much effort on proper enunciation that there is precious little left to expend on dramatic portrayal . James Bowman makes a more believable Ottone than does renowned countertenor Drew Minter , and Jennifer Smith 's Gismonda is simply beautiful . <p> While neither the best nor brightest of Handel 's operas , " Ottone " has been woefully ignored until these two recordings . With its small forces , both orchestral and vocal , Handel relied on musical and dramatic subtlety to carry the day , and succeeded admirably . <p> The recording quality of the Harmonia Mundi offering is better than Hyperion 's , and McGegan 's approach is more precise than King 's . Yet , none of this offsets the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's presentation is the more enjoyable . Kevin M. Williams
