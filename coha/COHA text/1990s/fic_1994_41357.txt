" I remember this river , " the old man began most of his stories . His hand , blackened by the Jericho sun , would be raised above his brow to shield his eyes . " It cuts through these hills like the smooth strokes of a swimmer and splinters off like them tiny veins on the back of your hand . Lord , I remember this river . " He 'd lower his hand and look down at me to see if I was paying attention . At ten , I was much too young to comprehend the significance of anything my grandfather said , but I liked to hear him talk . His stories , his voice , gave me a sense of security in an otherwise confusing world . <p> In the summer of 1950 , my father sent me down to Jericho from Philadelphia to stay with my grandfolks . He , too , believed that we would overcome one day . He was old then , nearly sixty-five . And while he never thought that he would live to see the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order for me to one day understand how far I had come , I needed to know where we had started . In his mind , Jericho was as good a starting place as any . <p> At the time , I did n't know why my father would send me to such a God-forsaken place . What I did know was that , when me and the old man went into Woolworth 's to have a hotdog , we had to eat it way back by the kitchen , not at the counter like everybody else . Our rootbeer did n't come in the big frosty mugs I had seen on the counter , but in paper cups . Our hotdogs were served on napkins instead of plates . I did n't mind because the old man did n't seem to mind . He just wanted me to have anything this world had to offer and would have endured both hell and high water to see that I got it . Me , I thought that we must have done something pretty bad to deserve that kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the riverside almost every day . It was the only place where he was truly happy . We would fish and swim until the sun went down . Then we would walk the mile or so along the dirt road back to the house . The old man owned his own land . He could n't vote , but he was a land-holding citizen . Anybody who tried to take that away from him would have had better luck someplace else . He did n't play when it came to his inalienable rights , especially the right to bear arms . Gramma may not have liked having a gun in her house , her being a Christian woman and all , but somewhere she understood that all the praying in the world could not change the world . So , She let him be . <p> Gramma would have our plates waiting for us on the big , black potbelly stove when we got home . She went to her meetings almost every night around sundown . The old man would kid her by saying something like , " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and listen to you wailin ' every night ? " She would n't pay him any mind . She thought that if she asked , she would receive . She knew she would n't always receive , only when she prayed just right . What she did n't know , and what my grandfather did n't tell her , was that praying really did n't have anything to do with it . All she had to do was believe that the Spirit being called upon was the Spirit within her own breast . Had she known that , her prayers would never have gone unanswered . <p> My grandfather never said a word of that to Gramma . He thought that she would never believe him because her religion kept her from true understanding . " As long as she 's b'lievin ' in another man 's book , " the old man would say , " she 'll never learn to b'lieve in herself . " That was n't the only reason he would n't tell her . The real reason was Mose . She never believed in Mose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the subject of his favorite story . He , like the old man , lived in Jericho all of his life , but he was n't from there . He was born in a small town one hundred miles north of Jericho called Logos . The old man seemed to think that was why Mose was so special . He would tell me the story of Mose each time we were down by the riverside . And though I knew the words to the story by heart at the end of the summer , I never could tell it like the old man . I remember the first time he told it like it was yesterday . <p> " Long before they put that interstate up there , " he said pointing above his head to the drone of passing automobiles coming from the new highway , " there did n't used to be anything up there but hills and sky . That 's how Mose liked it . This here was the prettiest part of the river . In the springtime , could n't see nothing but cherry blossoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He sat down along the riverside and paddled his feet in the water . His feet were rusty from always going barefoot I sat down next to him and tried to splash my feet around in the water too . I had my pants rolled up a little past my knee even though I knew my legs were too short to get near that much water . My legs were too short even to get my toes wet . I kept trying though , stretching my feet down under me with my arms back on the ground for support . I reached too far , the ground gave way , and I fell in . <p> " You might as well stay in the awhile and get yourself fresh . Get some of that corruption from that city life out of your soul . " <p> I had no idea what my grandfather was talking about . Naturally , he went on : " That water heals . It cured me of the cholera . I know that may be hard for you to b'lieve . Your Gramma does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a lie . I laid up sick for two days with a fever . Anybody 'll tell ya . My throat and mouth was so dry I could hardly say a word . I was jerking around in my sleep like the devil had jumped in me and got ahold of my body . It got so bad that nobody thought I was gon na make it , except for Mose . He carried me in arms about the size of your legs the whole three miles to this part of the river . My fever was so bad that I fell out . " <p> It was always at that moment in the story that the old man risked his credibility . It was n't that I did n't think he passed out . With a fever in the Jericho heat the was n't much else he could do but pass out . The walk down to the river , on the other hand , was no more than a mile . I let him have his license anyway . It was his story . <p> " When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river dunking me under the water . I did n't know whether I was coming or going . He just kept dunking me and dunking me . On the way home I had the shakes somethin ' terrible . He did n't have a towel to dry me off because he wanted the water to dry into my skin . I woke up two days later feeling Like nothing ever happened . " <p> But something had happened , and the old man knew it . It was n't the water that got him well . It was Mose . Mose believed that the river was just one form of the Law and that he and my old man were another . If all were one-and-the-same , then it followed , in his mind , that all should be in the same condition . He figured that the tranquility in one was enough to soothe the unnecessary turmoil in the other . The old man did n't quite see it that way . He thought that Mose was special . In a sense , he was . He was special in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Once Mose found out that they was going to build that trestle above the prettiest part of the river , he knew that things for him could only get worse . He worshipped this river like most folks worship Jesus . He would say , ' Nature do n't know favorites , it knows law . ' <p> " He would take a rock from me . I always collected rocks in a little satchel on the way down here to skip over the water . He would take a rock from me and skip it so the water would ripple and ask me , ' You see how that water did that ? It do n't matter who throws that rock , they get that . It do n't matter what color the man is . ' <p> " Mose never went down by the riverside while they w building the trestle , two whole years . The day they finished , he left the house early in the morning and headed toward the river without telling nobody . I seen him sneaking around the house , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew he was going to the river , I got worried I thought that he did n't want nothing to do with that river anymore . He knew I was following him . There was n't much he did n't know . He just went about his business and kept walking down to the river . When he got to the trestle , he climbed up it like it was a jungle gym or something . The whole time I was wondered what he was doing . I knew for sure he was gone . I thought the man could n't have been all there . I yelled up to him and asked what he was doing all the way up there like that . It took him a while to answer . When he did , his voice shook the hills and made the water splash like crazy . He yelled , ' The pure in heart shall see God . ' <p> " That sounded just as strange to me , almost like he was reading from the Bible . That was all he said and not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand , just like I 'm doing now and I looked at him real good and I saw it . I saw Mose jump off that trestle and fly away from it just as pretty as any robin I 've seen around he in the springtime . He flew off toward the sun until I could n't see him no more . That 's when I knew I had seen a man , as good a man as there ever was . " <p> It was true . Mose was as good a man as there ever was . My Gramma did n't believe it . " You ever seen a man fly ? " she would ask me . " You would think that as old as your grandfather is he could at least be honest . My nerves ca n't take all this dreaming he 's always doin ' . " She was right . I had never seen a man fly and that should have been enough for any rational mind to dismiss the old man as crazy . But there was something more in it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could feel it . <p> Mose knew that , with the building of the trestle , there was no hope for a man like himself . They built a monstrous wood-and-stone structure over the prettiest part of the river . Mose knew that anyone who could not see the beauty of the river would not see the beauty in themselves , all of themselves . Perhaps one day , he hoped , man would come to really see God . The trestle told him that man had a long way to go and that things would only get worse before they got better . Having already seen the charred remains of slavery and the failure of Reconstruction , Mose was not willing to wait around that long . <p> He was right . A year later , Jim Crow became the law of the land . <p> That was my last summer in the old Jericho . I left my Gramma and the old man to live a life of misunderstanding until his death ten years after I left . They had love . I had seen it . Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long . What they did n't have was a belief in their own unity . Even if she did n't believe him , my Gramma still could not see that the only place the infinite possibilities of life could unfold for the old man , under the laws of the land , was in his imagination . The old man , in all of his wisdom , did n't know that in a world of human fallibility what Gramma needed most was a man that she could see , touch , and believe in . That 's what I was for  --  to bridge the gap . That was the point of his telling me the story . It was the old man 's way of letting me know that what I saw before me was not necessarily what should be . I have carried that message around with me all of my life , like an old picture in an heirloomed locket . <p> The changes my father predicted came and went . Yet we still have a ways to go before we are truly free at last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better because better is still not good enough . My concern , now , is not whether or not I see things in reality as I know they truly should be . I 've grown too old and too weary for such optimism . Nor am I concerned with whether or not my own children live to see the day of universal enlightenment . All of that is out of my hands . All I can do is believe , pass that belief on to my children , and remember that river . <p>
