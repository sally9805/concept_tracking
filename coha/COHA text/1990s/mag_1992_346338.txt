For people who do n't like the idea of tampering with genes at all , the idea of eating genetically altered food is downright horrifying . Yet even the proconsumer FDA Commissioner David Kessler sided with an Administration decision , announced last week , that some bio-engineered fruits and vegetables will be allowed on the market without pre-testing , and without a warning label . <P> Genetic engineering involves adding or subtracting characteristics from an organism by either suppressing the action of a specific gene or by adding a gene from another plant , or even an animal . A few years ago , in an extreme example , scientists spliced a gene from a firefly into a tobacco plant , and the plant glowed in the dark . The kinds of changes allowed under the new policy are much less exotic : vegetables will be exempted from pre-testing only if their nutritional value has n't been lowered , if they incorporate only new substances  --  proteins or sugars , for example  --  that are already eaten in other foods , and if they do n't have new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadly to some people ) . One of the first products likely to hit the market is a tomato in which the gene that produces a rot-inducing enzyme has been deactivated . Another is a potato in which an enzyme that promotes bruising has been removed . <P> Critics , like anti-biotechnology activist Jeremy Rifkin , decried the FDA decision , arguing that tampering with nature could endanger consumers . In fact , though , many seemingly natural foods , including corn , nectarines and navel oranges , never existed before humans began to cross-breed  --  a form of genetic engineering that simply takes a little longer than the laboratory version .
