High plains . The last Sunday of March . Brilliant sunshine at eight in the morning . The unseasonable fifty-five-degree temperature made Coyote feel slightly sexual . And he had woken up with the remnants of a dream in which he was in bed with a strange woman . The warmth of the dream lingered with him , probably because his wife had been gone all month visiting relatives in California . <p> He raised his lean frame onto his hind legs , put on a windbreaker , and went out to rake the yard where snowdrifts had melted . After a half hour , he had a huge collection of dead leaves , cigarette butts , dog poop , and bleached-out beef bones . Beads of sweat popped off his snout . Clean , nonalcoholic sweat . <p> For four years running , there had been no beer cans or wine bottles in his yard . Four years since the day he quit the sauce , the day he began to see daylight at the end of the slimy tunnel that had been his life . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wanda left the reservation and moved twelve miles south across the state line to Heinzville , Nebraska . <p> This cowturd town of twelve hundred souls was roughly one-third Indian and two-thirds white . Of those white two-thirds , one third had an Indian in-law somewhere and the remaining third were just corpulent , cow-copulating rednecks . <p> Bending down to scoop the pile into a square-point shovel , Coyote saw the town dogcatchers setting a wire trap across the street in a corner of the elementary school playground . The two cowboy-clad women were redneck-decked from Stetsons to dung-heeled Tony Lamas . <p> Young , tall , lean , and sinewy , they sneered at Coyote as he continued to scrape up the dog poop . His first thought was what it would take to make them tumble to the dust in a fight . He strategized . Maybe bite one on the butt and grab her partner 's ear and rip it off . Then go to work on them with his claws while they 're howling . Coyote began to drool at the thought of wrestling the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Coyote saw one take a small bottle of liquid and dab a few drops inside the cage . Coyote pondered . Maybe it was some sex scent that made free-roaming dogs want to enter the cage . Maybe it was imitation sirloin perfume . More likely , it was the distilled souls of the dogcatchers themselves , he decided . <p> Here they were on land stolen from the Indians and yet these humans continued to torment Indians and dogs . The only dogs in the dog pound were wild Indian dogs . But these two city employees were fine-looking white women and no doubt , many Indian dogs drooled about the prospect of being caught by these dogcatchers . <p> When the dogcatchers caught the stray dog of a white citizen , they called the citizen up and asked him to please come get his dog . With Indian dogs , it was a twenty-five-dollar fine and the fine increased with any backtalk or show of hostility by either the dog or its master . <p> The sheriff 's department had a similar policy with humans . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubbed some Indian winos in the head and rolled them . He got away with it . In Borden , another cowturd town eleven miles east , a cop shot an Indian in the back the year before and got away with it . And cattle ranchers were always shooting innocent coyotes that had meandered out past the city limits . Of course , it went without saying that they too got away with it . <p> That 's just how things were . That 's why Coyote looked at the dogcatchers as opponents in a cosmic struggle of good versus evil , or maybe madness versus sanity . Last year they captured Gizzard , his Pekinese attack dog , for no reason . Because of such lunacy , Coyote thought the whole white world was deranged . And wherever he went , he always had their faint odor of insanity clinging to his hide . That was because whenever Coyote encountered lunacy , he wrestled it to the ground . Bits of craziness clung to him like cowpies hugging the sneakers of jogging hayseeds . That 's just how things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office and demanded release of Gizzard hours after they took him . The dogcatchers were n't under their command , the sheriff 's deputies smugly told him . <p> " Well , then who ? " Coyote asked , feigning anger . He could not control his desire for the dogcatchers . <p> " The mayor , " they said . " And besides , " they added , " them girls was only following orders for Christ 's sake . " <p> Stunned by their arrogant stupidity , Coyote could only think of the ongoing massacre of his own fine-furred race . And dogs , well , dogs were his first cousins . Eventually , though , he had gotten his Pekinese freed . And as one of the dogcatchers handed his dog back , she had made a point of staring point-blank at Coyote 's groin . <p> Now they were messing with him again . And he was excited again . When the dogcatchers were done setting their trap , they cruised off in a battered GMC pickup with a faded city decal . Three times in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On their third pass , Coyote hopped his white picket fence and got out to stop their truck . <p> Every night his old lady Wanda jogged past where they 'd put that trap , he told them . They remained impassive . <p> " My old lady gets caught in there , I 'm gon na come looking for you , both of you illiterate yahoos . I know where you babes live , " he said . <p> " Well , by all means , please do come on by , " one said . <p> " Parlez-vous menage i trois " said the other . <p> They glanced at each other with raised eyebrows , smiled , and then drove off , peeling rubber . Five minutes later , two sheriff 's squad cars screeched to a stop in front of his yard . Four cops grabbed Coyote and threw him to the ground . <p> His face was pressed against the pile of dog poop and bones . He did n't move , thinking of Rodney King and knowing firsthand what a police baton felt like when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to a squad car . They hauled him to the county jail and charged him with threatening two peace officers . The dogcatchers had caught an angry Coyote this time . <p> Coyote was placed in a small cell at the end of a short hallway . The female jailer could monitor him in a round mirror suspended outside his cell . The jailer was hefty , flame-haired , and she had big milk-cow eyes that fluttered behind some archaic , black-framed glasses . She had Coyote locked in a stare-down . <p> Coyote flopped on the metal cot , spat at the wall , and gently caressed his private parts , wondering if she might get off watching him do that . He thought of the two dogcatchers and his groin began to grow . In an instant , his shiny red tallywhacker was out and he was ready to squirt . <p> He spasmed , saw stars , and howled at the top of his lungs : " Arrrroooooo " His action was done more out of contempt than sexuality . He was disgusted with the entire system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , liebchen , " he said as he zipped up his pants and stared straight into her eyes . <p> The bulky Teutonic jailer walked up to his cell and smiled . She blew him a kiss and then shot him squarely in the heart with a .35 ? magnum . Coyote ricocheted off the walls and then crumpled into bloody stillness . He was dead , stiff as a board when hours later a city janitor tossed him in the back of the pickup and drove him to the boondocks where he quite unceremoniously dumped Coyote 's carcass . <p> Three days later on Easter Sunday , Old Bear went looking for a cigarette to borrow and stumbled upon a pile of fur and bones stinking up the high-plains sand . He looked closely and saw it was his old friend Coyote . <p> " Yo , Cootie Coyote , dude , are you dead or just trying to fake me out ? " Old Bear asked . <p> " For sure I 'm dead , ayyy , " Coyote said in a barely audible whisper . <p> " Whaddya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debating Nietzsche with the grains of sand ? " <p> " Got a cigarette I can borrow ? " Old Bear asked as he took off his seed cap and wiped the sweat from the inside band . <p> " That nasty crud is what killed me . That and a bullet from a federale 's .357 magnum , " Coyote said and then laughed and pointed his finger at his friend . " If you do n't quit smoking , Bear , then you 'll be a dead bag of bones too . " <p> " Awww , " Old Bear said and scooped up what was left of Coyote in his arms and carried him back to his cave . He sat Coyote down in an easy chair and asked him if he wanted some leftover watermelon soup . " Watermelon soup Yuck and yuckity , " said Coyote . <p> " Well , howzabout some hot macaroni casserole I 'll make it the way Unci taught me . First you boil the macaroni , then put it in a casserole dish and add a can of tomatoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you cover it with bread crumbs and bake it good . We got ta put some meat on your bones . Make you able to get a moon-howling boner again . " <p> " What for ? " Coyote asked . " I 'm dead . Deader than a doornail . Deader than a dinosaur fossil . Deader than a Mother Superior 's cobwebbed bloomers . I 'm old and dead and , what 's worse , I got some bad news for you , my friend . " <p> " So lay it on me , " Old Bear said and went about making his casserole anyway . <p> " You 're dead too , you simple bugmugger " <p> " Ayyyyyy . Always the trickster ... " <p> " Look in the mirror , Bear , " Coyote laughed . " Look into your eyes . You 'll see you 're no longer there . Go ahead . Go look . I ai n't bullshellacking you . I mean look at what 's going on . We 'd have to be in some nether world for us to even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crap , " Old Bear said . " We 've been friends for years . <p> And you 've been a bullshitter as long as I can remember . " <p> Nevertheless , Old Bear walked to the bathroom and stared at his eyes in the mirror . He winked and blinked and stared again . Sure enough . Coyote was right . He was not inside his eyes . He splashed some cold water on his face and looked again . He was not inside his eyes . Maybe he was as dead as Coyote . He walked back to the kitchen where Coyote was up and messing with the casserole , pouring Tabasco sauce all over it . <p> Coyote winked . <p> " You always did have a thing for Mexican food , " Old Bear said and put the casserole back in the oven . <p> " Well ? " Coyote said . <p> " Well , what " <p> " Tell me whatcha seen , " Coyote laughed . " It ai n't the end of the world . Being dead ai n't that bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dead and do n't know it . For reals " <p> " No more bedroom Olympics , no more hide the salami , " said Old Bear and then sat down on his haunches and began to bawl . <p> " Yo , Bear . You ai n't had none in more than ten years anyways . So what are you crying about ? " <p> " At least I could fantasize and pound my pudendum , " said Old Bear as he reached for a Kleenex . <p> " Do n't do no good to fantasize , " said Coyote . " It was my lust for them dogcatchers that got me into trouble in the first place . But , if it 'll make you feel better , we can add a can of tuna fish to the casserole . " <p> " Ennut " said Old Bear . " Now you 're talking . Here , give me your hide and I 'll get you straightened out . " <p> Coyote handed him his hide and Old Bear put it in his washer , then his drier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Try this on for size , " he told his old friend . Coyote put his hide on and did n't look half bad , almost spiffy . Bear brushed his own hair and splashed some Aqua Velva on his hairy face . He handed the bottle of aftershave to his buddy . Coyote gargled with it and then swallowed the turquoise liquid . <p> " We 're going to tell each other that we are alive and , if we say so , we must be . To prove it , we 're going out , " Old Bear said and winked slyly . <p> " Yessiree , we 're outta here . " <p> " Out where ? " Coyote asked . <p> " I know a couple old blond English teachers who work over at the Indian school . They always looked dead to me and besides , it 's a holiday . <p> They ai n't working . We 're gon na go see if they can still huff and puff and kiss fur good . " <p> " I sure hope you got some conundrums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Old Bear . " That 's all I 'd need now is to catch me some of that human-plague virus . End up wired to tubes and machines , babbling death songs and looking like a skeleton . " <p> " No shit , Sherlock , I 'm with you on that , even if we are possibly dead anyways , " Coyote said as he and his friend diddlybopped out of the cave and across the chilled sands towards the Indian school . <p> " Human nooky ai n't half bad in a pinch , " Old Bear said . <p> " It 's O.K. , I guess , but it 's nothing compared to a badger or a skunk . <p> And ooo-la-la , man , them funky skunks can get you going , " Coyote said and made a gesture pinching his nose . Coyote never mentioned sex with female coyotes in front of Old Bear , and Old Bear never discussed sex with female bears in front of Coyote . <p> " I sure could use a cigarette , " Old Bear said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were walking in a sweet , blue haze . The early spring sun was limp and refused to evaporate the Aqua Velva that they 'd splashed on themselves . <p> " My casserole " Old Bear screamed all of a sudden . " I left the damn oven on . It 'll burn down my cave . " <p> " Geez-Louise , are you getting Alzheimer 's or what ? " Coyote asked . <p> " I really got ta go back , " Old Bear said and turned . <p> " Sheeeeez , " Coyote said and fell to the sand , a heap of fur and stinking bones . <p> " Sorry , " Old Bear said . " Rest your bones just a while . " <p> " Just let me be dead in peace , " Coyote whined . <p> " Do n't be so dramatic , just give me twenty minutes , " Old Bear laughed . " Then I 'll be back soon and we 'll both get us a piece . " <p> Old Bear got back to his cave and the air was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't resist it . He ate the whole thing and then fell asleep . He dreamed a dream so wondrous , so fantastic and beautiful that it does not bear repeating because no humans except a few old-time Indians would ever understand it . It was a dream of green beauty and flowers when humans and animals were the best of friends . <p> Then he awoke and went to help his dead friend Coyote get laid . And they did . And it was O.K. Not great , just O.K. Coyote went home and finished the yard-raking he had started two weeks earlier . The very same dogcatchers were cruising their city truck around his block . Coyote went inside and closed the blinds on all his windows . He peeked out at them and when he was sure they were gone , he went back outside and continued raking . Those white girls sure were pretty . Pretty and pretty damn dangerous . <p> Why Coyote Knotted His Whanger <p> Five months later , towards the end of summer , Coyote heard a noise and peered up over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since Wanda kicked him out of the house for flirting with the dogcatchers . He saw the last cowboy and the last cowboy was not on television or on the silver screen . <p> The last cowboy looked like he could have been a clone of Ross Perot , but he had a red neck and was clearly a dried-out drunk . He was standing on a deserted highway winding wearily through the Nebraska sandhills . The oven of late summer was cooking the last cowboy 's stringy flesh . His car had broken down and he had no cash to fix it . He was broke , too broke to even pay attention . <p> The last cowboy looked around and swore up a storm . No houses , telephones , or televisions were in sight . Coyote could almost hear the cowboy doing an assessment of his sad life . He was middle-aged , broke and jobless , with two heart attacks and one gall bladder job in the body bank and his wife was unabashedly boinking a younger man . <p> Coyote suspected that invisible electric vultures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last gasp of common sense , for the last tango of his tough , white meat . <p> " Howdy there Mr. Hopalong , " Coyote yelled at the human and he rose to his hind legs and waved . <p> " Hummmmppphhh , " the last cowboy answered . <p> Coyote reached into his cooler , grabbed an icy bottle of Budweiser and walked upright towards the old cowboy . <p> " Thirsty ? " Coyote asked . <p> " Faaaaact . That 's a fact . Thirsty and angry , " the old man said and reached for the beer . <p> " Well , you 're thirsty and angry . I 'm sad and horny as hell and living in the bushes to boot , " Coyote said and winked . <p> " Christ , I hope you ai n't one of them perverts , " the man said . <p> " No , I 'm hetero , " Coyote said and flexed his bicep . <p> " Hetero What 's that " <p> " I 'm a straight arrow . I ai n't no pervert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gas or what ? " <p> " Broke down . Life should n't be this hard for a white man who 's been to war but never to jail . " <p> " I was just released from the can five months ago , " Coyote told him . <p> " Was charged with assaulting some dogcatchers verbally , but then the jailer killed me . " <p> " Never heard such crapola , " the old cowboy said . " But you never can tell these days . The whole country 's going to hell in a handbasket . When they took God out of the classroom , they took God out of America . " <p> " Hmmm , " Coyote murmured and scratched at some fleas dancing around his groin . " And which God might that be " <p> " The only one , God damnit , " said the cowboy as he squinted suspiciously at Coyote . " The Lord God of the Bible . Yahweh . " <p> " My way , Yahweh , whatever , " said Coyote as heard something and perked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a spiraling dust cloud in the distance . When it approached , he was able to see it was nothing but a brown UPS truck speeding across the land . <p> " And the Darkness is creeping from south to north . Here , even here in the Heartland the Darkness is corrupting , threatening and changing , scaring and scarring , " the old man said and took a long drink . <p> " Hmmm , " Coyote said . " Darkness , huh " <p> " My own teenaged kids done quit school and now dress like those dirtbag gangster rappers on MTV , " the cowboy said . " But legislation demands my tolerance . It 's against the law to openly oppose the Darkness . I feel so helpless . What the holy hell happened to my country ? " <p> Coyote spit and shrugged . <p> The old cowboy restarted his flapping jaws . " It was n't so bad when it was only them Indians we had to put up with . It was n't so bad when it was only them lazy good-for-nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagle soaring . <p> " Look , " he told the last cowboy . " An eagle . A good omen . " <p> The old cowboy craned his neck skyward . Coyote let out a deep sigh and then another . He regretted that his civic sense had led to this . Coyote snatched back his bottle of beer and ran off into the shimmering heat . Coyote had once been married to an Indian girl . And he did n't like people badmouthing his ex-in-laws . <p> " Up yours , you racist , " Coyote yelled when he thought he was out of hearing range of the old man . <p> " Yeah , you 'd like to , would n't you , you damned hairy pervert , " the last cowboy gasped and flipped his middle finger into the air . <p> " Maybe . Bend over and we 'll both find out , " Coyote hooted , not wanting the old white man to have the last word . <p> Two days later , Coyote was back in the slammer . Smoking a cigarette , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visions of his dogs marching outside the county jail carrying signs . He 'd been in cold storage a week this time . He 'd been charged with stealing beer from the old white cowboy . The old man had gone down to the sheriff 's department and filed charges against him . Unreal So much for good deeds . <p> The day after he was arrested , the federales offered to let him go with a simple $25 fine for disturbing the peace , but he told the sheriff to go doublejointed upon himself . The sheriff turned red , said the hell with you and tried to grab Coyote through the cell bars so Coyote hocked a big green loogie on him . <p> " You want to die again , just keep that up , " the Sheriff said . <p> " I 'm a political prisoner , " Coyote said lamely , not that he had that much fear of death anymore . <p> The next day they hauled Coyote before the magistrate and gave him seven days in jail , minus time served . The original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge he did n't want the local gendarmes to mess with any dogs because all dogs were his cousins . Leave them alone , he said , or he 'd be before his bench again . <p> " Who 's John Darms ? " the judge asked and gave him a stern yet quizzical look . The judge had the dangerous combination of no education and no sense of humor . He was a forty-five-year-old white-haired man with a lifelong case of severe acne . He 'd spent most of his life growing wheat . <p> " Never mind , " Coyote said . " I just want my dogs left alone . " <p> " I make the rules around here , " the judge said . <p> " Rules rule , " Coyote said and winked . The truth was that Coyote did want the dogcatchers to leave his dogs alone . He wanted them to mess with him . They were so pretty . And his shiny redness was getting firm . <p> Coyote was n't always so protective of his cousins the dogs . He was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved for that matter . For nearly twenty years he had lived in the ethereal dusk of the bottle . His soul , his fears , his hopes and dreams were anesthetized daily , and of course , that 's why people and animals too became addicted to alcohol . At least that 's what it said in the A.A. booklet he had started to carry with him these days . <p> Coyote knew that the sauce obliterated reality . That much was obvious . It was also no big cosmic secret that firewater soothed fears . When he sobered up four years ago , Coyote came to know the beauty of dogs as he had during his childhood . He began to communicate with them and they became partners in his new , sober world . They became his main companions , much to the chagrin of his old lady Wanda . Wanda had never really liked dogs much after one slipped her his bone when she was in her teens . It had been a Great Dane . <p> " I do n't see why you like them or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day . " You used to bite them and really treat them nasty when you were still drinking . Make them go without food for days . " <p> True . Yes , he did . But these dogs he had now were never abused by him . He got them after he sobered up . What she meant was that he had abused his other dogs , Pee Bear and Puppy Luppy . Worse , he was responsible for their deaths . That had happened five years ago , on the final year of his seemingly eternal binge . Pee Bear was an English retriever . He showed up in Coyote 's yard as a puppy , a brown , round ball of love who resembled a teddy bear . But he was untrainable inside and peed constantly on the rugs , so Coyote named him Pee Bear . <p> Puppy Luppy was a black Lab he found under the stairs of the tribal college center in Manderson . He , too , was a young puppy when Coyote brought him home . He named him Puppy Luppy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they matured two years later . They kept winos and thieves away from his house and kicked tail on any stray dogs who came down his street . <p> The two dogs had a wild-ass streak and chased cattle and once killed a young heifer which Coyote then loaded up in he back of his small station wagon and took home and butchered . They feasted for a week on steaks , ribs and succulent roasts . <p> Remembering the fine , tender , grease-dripping meat made Coyote drowsy . He fell back to sleep and dreamed of the pan-fried liver and onions he would ask his wife to cook for him once he got out of the slammer . Sweet onions , batter-dipped , golden liver , and freedom . He slept and salivated and woke up hungry and remembered that his wife Wanda had indeed kicked him out of the house . <p> For a moment he was unsure whether he was still dreaming or not . The fire-haired jailer was standing outside his cell . Her chunky flesh was vibrating , and Coyote could smell her excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd read the recent papers about that woman in Virginia who 'd chopped her husband . Besides , he 'd learned his lesson . He 'd learned his lesson . His whanger was n't going to get him into trouble again . He reached down underneath the thick jailhouse blanket that was covering him and tied it into a knot . He did n't know whether it felt good or bad , but he knew it felt safe . <p> He smiled , closed his eyes and pretended to sleep until the mean , firehaired woman walked away . He did n't want to be killed twice in the same lifetime by the same woman . Such a thing was possible . <p> Coyote in the City of Angels <p> It was a skanky summer day in Los Angeles . The sun beat down upon the garbage dumpsters and gave the unmoving air a bad case of rotten breath . The sidewalks baked , drawing moisture out of the mouths of every living thing . Up in Hollywood , the dealmakers were looking for a live brain to suck ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East L.A. , the residents were going about their daily business of murdering each other . <p> On the downtown side of Pico-Union , Coyote had spent the entire morning searching for a lifesaving , cool drink of firewater . It had been over six months since he 'd left the Great Plains and nearly a year since his wife had gotten bitten by a squirrel with rabies and died . Even though he was n't living with her at the time , her death propelled him towards seeking his own . He 'd put his dogs in the care of Old Bear and hit the road , then the skids , and had rejoined the shadow soldiers in Grand Army of Booze . <p> Coyote was a sorry sight to see . He 'd developed a severe case of mange and not only had frequent shaking spells , but he smelled bad . He stunk of disease and impending death . Day after day , he 'd dragged his swollen paws over the scorched pavement , his tail dangling between his legs . Now staggering to a shabbier street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that beckoned him . The bar was named " The Shanty " and was frequented by citified Indians and other denizens of the once-natural world . <p> Coyote 's only thought was of cold liquid trickling down his parched throat and then up to pacify his fiery brain . Shaking , drawing up all his strength , he assumed as straight a posture as possible , put his right foot forward and entered the blue building . Stumbling in the darkness , he stubbed his toe on a chair . It hurt like hell and he did a strange dance until the pain subsided . He felt like a fool until he found a stool and sat down , waiting for his eyes to adjust to the darkness . <p> " Whatcha want , Cuz ? " asked a burly , dark-skinned human with a shaved head . <p> Coyote stared at the man . " Do n't I know you ? " <p> " I do n't know . Do you ? " <p> " I 'm from South Dakota , " Coyote said . <p> " No kiddin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally from Pine Ridge , " the man said . " My name is Verdell Ten Bears . Got in a little trouble back home and headed out . " <p> " Never heard of you , " Coyote said with an apologetic shrug of his bony shoulders . " Sorry , I thought you looked familiar . " <p> " All us savages look the same . Take my word on it . You do n't know me from Shinola . I do n't know that many coyotes anyways . The only coyotes I ever saw were those that got nailed by speeding UPS trucks or those in hunters ' traps . " <p> " Very funny , " Coyote said and coughed to hide his disgust . He knew for a fact that when Indians disappeared into the steel-and-concrete canyons of cities they changed . They became hopeless , lost , or just like the white men . To him , urban Indians were the most pitiful of God 's creatures , even more pitiful than the white man . <p> " So what is it ? What can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " A cool , cool drink , " Coyote answered . <p> " A drink of what  --  ? " <p> " Gin-and-tonic 's O.K. , " Coyote said as he handed the man a handful of change that he had panhandled earlier . The shaved head brought him a large glass of cold , clear liquid with a slice of unhealthy lime floating atop it . Coyote lifted the glass to his lips and then screamed . There was a monster in the glass He poured out the contents onto the floor and asked the man for another . <p> " It 's your money , dude , " the man said and brought Coyote another large tumbler of the liquid . <p> Again , Coyote raised the glass to his lips , but again he saw the monster on the surface of the clear liquid . <p> " Arrrggghhk-aroooo , " Coyote screamed . " What is this funky creature in my drink ? What the hell is going on here What the hell is this ? Psychedelic gin ? " <p> The large , scary-looking bartender ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an everyday occurrence . Coyote decided to take action . He bared his teeth and raised the glass to his lips . He would show the monster how ferocious he was and it would run . It did n't though . Coyote looked into the glass and cringed . Inside , on the surface of the liquid , a dark , hairy , repulsive monster stared back with bared teeth . Coyote drew back in terror . Coyote slapped his face to try to regain a grasp around reality 's neck . He hoped this monster in his drink was n't a prelude to the shimmering d.t. ' s . <p> He sat on his haunches and took a deep breath . Maybe the monster would leave of its own accord . It certainly was one of the ugliest beasts he 'd ever seen in his life . After a few minutes , Coyote leaned forward and looked into the glass . The monster was still there . Coyote panicked and ran out of the blue building , forgetting his deep thirst . But , after a few desperately alcoholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet another blue building on the same block . <p> Although he was tired , dirty , and half-cooked from the heat , Coyote walked in the direction of the second blue building . He would find a cool drink there and his thirst was what propelled each step , All during the journey down the never-ending block , the face of the monster from the other building danced in his mind . <p> " That was one skanky-lookin ' bugmugger , " Coyote whispered to no one in particular . " One ugly hunk of head cheese . " <p> The sun was beginning to set and still there was no relief from the heat . Coyote could walk no farther and fell asleep in a cool alleyway behind a large green dumpster . He was so exhausted he slept through the whole night and awoke the next morning when the sun was high in the sky . <p> Tired and disoriented but more thirsty than he had ever been in his life , he decided to go back to the first blue building . His thirst was now greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His throat was on fire as he entered the building He would kill anything that stood between him and the life-blood of liquor . <p> " Oh , you again , " said the dark , muscular man with no head hair as he wiped down the cigarette-scarred bar . Coyote nodded and ordered a large drink . <p> " Same as before ? " Ten Bears asked . <p> " Same and hurry , " Coyote rasped . <p> " Here you go , " the bartender said as he handed Coyote the gin-and-tonic . Before looking into the glass , Coyote handed it to another human , a grizzled old Mexican sitting at the bar . This Mexican , a former assistant organizer in the United Farm Workers , took the glass and half drained it . He burped and thanked Coyote , but Coyote grabbed the glass back and prepared to drink the remaining half . " Gracias , " the old man muttered . <p> " If this old Pancho Villa can drink it safely , then the monster must have gone , " Coyote mumbled lowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes and took a deep , refreshing gulp . The liquid was pure heaven and his aching bones and flaming soul felt instantly relieved . He poured the remaining liquid down his dry , sandy gullet . <p> " Salvation , " he shouted at the Indian named Ten Bears . <p> " That mean you want another ? " <p> " Yes , damn right , get me another , " he yelled at the bartender . When the fresh drink arrived , he noticed to his great dismay that the monster had reappeared . He slammed the glass down in fear and disgust . The vibrating glass caused ripples on the surface of the gin and the monster disappeared . Coyote thought this strange and stared until the liquid was calm again . And when the booze had stopped vibrating , the hideous creature was back on the surface again . <p> Coyote took his paw , placed a claw into the liquid and stirred the liquid . Again , the monster vanished . Coyote then realized that the ghastly creature was his own reflection . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hah-hah-hooooo .

He was a practicing drunk and had been for years . Even the thought of going to A.A. made him want to kick ass on somebody , anybody . For a brief moment , Coyote considered slamming him in the back of the head with his glass . The monster was now inside him and he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind . <p> " The hell with this city , " he said to no one in particular . But outside , thousands of blacks and Chicanos had somehow heard him . They nodded in assent at the new voice of God ,
