<p> The two Chicago women who design clothing under the Milu label do n't want to be as big as Ralph Lauren or Calvin Klein . They do n't want to walk down the street and see their dresses , sweaters and jackets on every body going by . And they have no desire to stage over-hyped fashion shows just to get attention . <p> Nope , Miriam Kaufman and Luisa Gasiewski just want to make clothes . And not stuff that every Jane and Jill would wear , either . Their goal is to offer the wearer unique pieces that she infuses with her own personality . The entire concept is on display at the newly opened Milu ( named for both partners ' first names ) boutique at 2463 N. Lincoln . <p> To the casual eye , Milu 's clothes are understated , yet complex . They do n't drip sex appeal with low-cut necks and cinched waists and super-short skirts . They do n't feature the latest high-tech fabrics ; instead , their natural fibers and silhouettes draw more from the first half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not old-fashioned . Like the clothes of fellow designer J. Morgan Puett ( who trained at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago ) , Milu 's apparel has an almost intellectual appeal . <p> " It 's not about romancing the client into buying the clothes , " says Kaufman . " We want them to love it and buy the clothes for that reason . " <p> It all begins in their 1,500-square-foot boutique and sample production house , where they sell their women 's and children 's clothing , along with men 's bathrobes and pajamas and home linens . And Milu 's customer base is as eclectic as the items themselves . Everyone from working women to arty professionals to prep schoolgirls shops Milu , says Kaufman . And they all seem to see something magical in the simple things they find here . <p> " People transform when they put the clothes on and go back to a time when a dinner party was really special , " she says . " You slow down a little bit and think about the world , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about the rat race , as they have done the corporate fashion thing . Kaufman was a head designer at Jessica McClintock , a special-occasion womenswear line with a retro flair . And the women met while working for the late Chicago designer Becky Bisoulis . <p> " We both felt out of place , " says Gasiewski of their days at Bisoulis ' operation . Not that they did n't like their work , but they wanted to do their own thing . So for about a year , she and Kaufman had lunches where they really got to know each other , and talked about their design dreams . <p> " When we first started , " says Kaufman , " we wanted a store where we would clothe the whole person  --  not just sell them a shirt . It 's not about drawing a picture  --  it 's about creating a shape , a pattern . Anyone can draw a picture on a piece of paper . " <p> " We wanted to create a mystique , " adds Gasiewski . <p> Three years later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither Kaufman nor Gasiewski regularly reads fashion magazines or industry bible Women 's Wear Daily . They do n't keep up with what competing designers are showing . Instead , they get their inspirations from books and fabric publications . They find bolts of antique fabric in old warehouses and turn them into clothing . This nostalgic edge also is reflected in the store 's decor , which features old mannequins and antique beds and assorted knickknacks the women have collected over the years . Even their garment hang tags feature old-time photos and pattern sketches . <p> " When we started , we wanted ( the store ) to feel like a home , " says Gasiewski , who moved from Poland to the United States 12 years ago . And it does , complete with Kaufman 's dog , Diego , a friendly canine who sometimes wanders out onto the selling floor and the Lincoln Avenue display window . The women renovated the space themselves , with help from Gasiewski 's husband , Peter . <p> When Milu first hit the fashion scene three years ago , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles to a wedding , and figured they 'd pack some of their muslin and gauze dresses and bathrobes just in case . They were walking down the street when a clothing sales agent ran out of a nearby restaurant and asked where they 'd bought their clothes . That bit of self-advertisement helped them place their line in the trendy Fred Segal boutique . Barneys New York also became an early client . <p> Soon after , the Milu line was picked up by New York showroom Gabriel &; Kramer , which sold their wares to cutting-edge boutiques around the country , including Chicago 's Toshiro and Art Effect . But since opening their own shop , they have stopped selling to other local stores . They are , however , continuing to ship to stores in New York City and San Francisco . <p> The goal , say the partners , is to keep Milu a Chicago-centered operation . ( Before moving to Lincoln Avenue , they were based at 2256 W. Grand . ) Production , which used to be done in L.A. , is now handled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their New York showroom , and are selling the line themselves . And while Milu hosted an acclaimed fashion show in New York 's SoHo district back in 1994 , they do n't plan on doing that again , either . " It 's not our scene at all , " says Kaufman . " We want to make clothing ; we do n't want to be fashion stars . " <p> Even Milu 's choice of models reflects their unconventional bent . The store 's photo albums are filled with women wearing their clothes  --  and few ; of them ; could be described as conventionally pretty . " We ask anyone , " says Kaufman . " We are n't bashful . " Some of the " models " are artistic friends ; others are acquaintances from yoga class . Still others they met in the aisles at Whole Foods . <p> It 's no surprise , then , that Milu 's goal is to clothe " real women . " <p> " We try to do things that are flattering , " says Kaufman , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our ideal customers are ourselves  --  people with bodies . " That means dresses and shifts skim the body , rather than hugging every curve . Jackets accentuate the waist and hips gently , without squeezing the wearer too tight . And some long dresses are gored , adding fullness and ease of movement without exposing the legs . <p> Milu 's clothes come in sizes 1 to 4 , which fit petites to women up to size 12 . And it 's affordable ( for designer wear ) , with prices ranging from $ 30 for silver silk scarves to $ 112 for ruffled cotton blouses to $ 186 for muslin-and-terry bathrobes . Most girls ' dresses are under $ 50 . Muslin pillowcases are $ 25 ; terry-lined muslin towels range from $ 22 to $ 50 . The eclectic clothing and home furnishings line already has caught the attention of Chicago photo stylists , who often borrow merchandise for editorial spreads and layouts . <p> But Milu understands that success is a double-edged sword . They say they 'd like to open another concept shop in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We do n't want to be Donna Karan , " says Kaufman . " If I wanted to be wealthy , I would have gone to law school , you know ? " <p> Gasiewski continues , " We are probably not going to be a huge , huge store with huge profits , but that 's not what we want . We want to make enough to support ourselves  --  and to have fun . " <p> " This is our way to be starving artists , " says Kaufman , " and not starve . " @x Con : Reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere is important , but top-down mandates will not work . The Kyoto Protocol is a perfect example of the inherent flaws in such treaties . Why ? First , without requiring equal participation from all greenhouse gas-emitting countries , a global treaty would put the United States at an unfair disadvantage economically . Climate change is a global challenge requiring a global response . However , emerging nations such as China and India have said that they will not accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact of such targets on their economies . Without participation from the developing world , the United States could meet its reduction targets yet would not put a dent in greenhouse gas emissions . In fact , even if the United States acted immediately and ceased emitting all greenhouse gases , emissions from the developing world are expected to double by 2035 and triple by 2060 . The Kyoto treaty created a nonlevel playing field where the undeveloped world is able to produce goods at a cheaper price through the use of less costly , energy-inefficient methods , threatening U.S. jobs and competitiveness in the global market . In addition , some developed countries have come up with creative ways for getting around their reduction allocations and treaty responsibilities . Germany , for example , achieved its targets through unification with East Germany , as the latter 's collapsed economy and the shutdown of dilapidated factories resulted in drastic emissions reductions . Austria , which claims to be a big producer of clean energy , purchases substantial energy from Hungarian coal-fired power plants . Such machinations are not bringing the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce greenhouse gas emissions . A second reason a global treaty will not work is that the technologies needed to achieve mandated targets do not yet exist or are in embryonic stages of development . Wind and solar , for example , are promising technologies , but they provide only intermittent energy . Though Congress authorized the development of 130 clean energy technologies , these initiatives remained unfunded until passage of the economic stimulus package . Without incentives to make current energy sources capable of burning more cleanly , to capture and store greenhouse gas emissions , or to produce enough low-carbon energy to replace fossil fuels , the world will have no means of achieving meaningful greenhouse gas reductions . Third , environmental groups are , ironically , standing in the way of increased use of existing carbon-free technology . Nuclear energy -- carbon free -- is opposed by the environmental community . Moreover , environmentalists recently delayed or stopped more than 65 renewable energy and transmission projects through local opposition or litigation . Kyoto is an example of a failed policy , but that does n't mean we ca n't reduce greenhouse gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy , we must ask ourselves two questions . First , does the solution allow the economies of all nations to grow ? Reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere will be a long effort , costing trillions of dollars . Still , those costs can and should be managed so that they do n't destroy entire economies , kill jobs , and lower our standard of living . Second , does the solution allow flexibility and require cooperation from all greenhouse gas-producing countries ? Our leaders must appreciate that every nation can contribute to greenhouse gas emission reductions in a way that suits it best . Some countries are equipped to preserve forests ; others are capable of replacing old coal plants with state-of-the-art coal technology . Some countries will choose a cap-and-trade system ; others will develop and deploy new technologies . It 's less important how greenhouse gas producers contribute to the solution than that they contribute , period . The world can reduce greenhouse gas emissions . But to do so , it must move from rigid ideology to practical approaches that create the economic wealth needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William L. Kovacs is the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 's vice president for environment , technology , and regulatory affairs .
