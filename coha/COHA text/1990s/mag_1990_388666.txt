An election 's coming : Bill Bradley has been to Iowa , and Jesse Jackson has been to Iraq . The Left does n't like George Bush 's taking a stand against Iraq , but who cares ? The Nation has muttered , Ramsey Clark has given a press conference-but all the attention that has been given to arguments pro and con has gone to conservative arguers . The end of Communism , which was supposed to marginalize conservatives by depriving them of someone to hate , has in fact , by confirming their long-standing diagnosis of world events , moved them to center stage . Meanwhile , who wants to know what people who were so wrong about the Berlin Wall think of the Persian Gulf ? It may not make sense to cite the lopsidedness of the debate as further proof that " our " time has come , when we disagree among ourselves . But theirs has gone . The preliminary census figures are in , and lots of municipalities  --  especially big cities  --  are complaining that they 've been victimized by undercounting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of its people since 1980 , though a Time poll claims that 59 per cent of those who have n't left yet would like to . The data indicate that Philadelphia has lost 8.6 per cent of its 1980 population . Mario Cuomo charges that the figures have been shaped by " people who do n't live in the Northeast . " That would be a growing number of Americans , 55 per cent of whom now live in the Sun Belt . The Big Apple alone may lose three seats in Congress . Darn shame . The August unemployment rate  --  5.6 per cent-was the highest in two years . Rates are always tricky to interpret this time of year since government statisticians are never really sure how much of the fall in employment reflects kids returning to school . Far more disturbing from our point of view is the sharp decline in the number of young people who want to work . The fraction of 16 to 19-year-olds in the labor force has plunged by more than three percentage points since January , to 52.9 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even when you net out the innocuous explanations  --  in school , at home taking care of children  --  roughly one-third of young blacks and one-fifth of all young people are not in the labor force . <p> The real story is not the decline in employment but the apparent decline in work ethic . Before its August recess , the Senate approved its version of Congress 's biennial exercise in " anticrime " legislation . There are some commendable parts to it , namely the establishment of a federal death penalty and a curtailment of frivolous appeals by prisoners . There are also the expected assortment of " get tough " measures for drug dealers , S &L; cheats , and environmental felons , some of which may prove productive of something other than reelection of incumbents . What nags at us , though , is the feeling that all this is little more than busying ourselves at the margins of a criminal-justice system gone deeply rotten . Most of the real damage to our system has been done by the federal judiciary over the past thirty years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution . " The problem is criminal procedure , not substantive criminal law . A genuinely productive anti-crime initiative would contain an abolition of the exclusionary rule , a reversal of Miranda , authorization for jurors to consider a defendant 's criminal history , and a dismantling of various other barriers to the search for truth . In other words , changes that would reverse the manhandling of the Constitution by the Warren Court . After calling the comptroller of the state of New York , who is also his running-mate , an " idiot , " Pierre Rinfret , liberal patsy and Republican candidate for governor , wisely shut up and let his advisors issue a series of position papers . Meanwhile , the authentic Republican opponent to Mario Cuomo , Herb London , continues to address issues of immediate importance . This month , he appeared at the Korean fruit stand in Brooklyn that has been picketed by black bigots , and called on Cuomo and Mayor Dinkins to enforce the law , including laws the picketers have been breaking . Do n't tell Rinfret about the visit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind , and no Republican would be safe . Get ready for the USR . The Soviet Union is thinking of dropping the word " Socialist " from its name . The socialist idea is in total disrepute , except here in the good old USSA . Voters in Ontario , Canada 's richest and most populous province , are known as a phlegmatic lot who like sound , sensible , low-key governments . In last week 's provincial election , they got uncharacteristically mad , and threw out the arrogant , big-tax Liberal government . But their madness knew no bounds : they elected the New Democratic Party in a landslide . The Ontario NDP had never won an election before , because most of its candidates are either academic socialists or fire-breathing trade unionists reminiscent of the Militant Tendency in the British Labor Party . Canada 's image of bland reliability has now cracked into shards . In a summer in which Canada surprised the world with its constitutional crisis over the Meech Lake accord and with a Mohawk rebellion , the Ontario election is the greatest absurdity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin Wall fell , West Germans had fled East . The chambers of commerce in Buffalo , Cleveland , and Detroit , which had been enviously watching as so many major international firms were choosing Ontario as their location for new factories , ca n't believe their luck . As of this month , to see the world 's largest Christian church you must go not to Rome or Paris or Cologne  --  but to Yamoussoukro , Ivory Coast . Newly consecrated by Pope John Paul II , Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro is twice the size of St. Peter 's Basilica , contains four times the stained glass of Chartres , and holds three hundred thousand people . The figures come readily to mind because the news reports have dwelt on the " opulence " of the project , which has cost some $180 million . Eighty-five-year old President Flix Houphout-Boigny in particular has been faulted for his " extravagance " never mind that if almost any other African chieftain had reigned that long he would , at this stage , be raising up vast memorials to himself " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times , " is the basilica a glory or a scandal ? " The cost benefit question is not morally irrelevant , and yet is as hard to calculate as the value of the fine ointment " squandered " on an honored visitor when it might have been sold to raise money for the poor . It all depends on the spirit in which the money is spent . Any church built in the wrong spirit is a scandal , and any built in the right spirit a glory , the poorer the builder the more glorious the achievement . Let us be the first to entertain the hysterical prediction that the Federal Government will soon be supervising our personal lives in unprecedented ways . HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan has announced a 298point plan to improve our health , for which the FG is assuming increased responsibility ( and expense ) . The plan , called Healthy People 2000 , includes such goals as cutting down on obesity , smoking , teenage pregnancy , AIDS , mental illness , stress , and 292 other non-desiderata . One observer describes the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveillance bureaucracy . " Do you ever get the feeling LBJ never left us ? The first crack babies are hitting the schools . More than three hundred thousand drug-exposed babies are born a year , perhaps a third of them exposed to crack . Those who are reaching school age have minimal attention spans , and an aversion to being touched . They are prone to tantrums and slow to learn . Word-coiners have already coined the word " bio-underclass . " Before we despair , a few caveats . Schools have been coping  --  or failing to cope  --  with alcohol-exposed babies for centuries . The severity of the crack babies ' ailments varies ; some infants suffer primarily , not from the drug , but from the anomic and immoral behavior of neglectful and brutal parents . Where that obtains , judges and caseworkers should be more willing to place the children of addicts in foster care . States should also consider placing criminal sanctions on exposing fetuses to addictive drugs . Abortion supporters have opposed this as being covertly right-to-life , which casts a cold light on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are born . Mario Cuomo recently explained why he would sign a bill banning dwarf-tossing and - bowling : " These are human beings . This disturbs me . I do n't know why . " At the same time , Governor Cuomo also feels " There is an element of the absurd or incongruous in men making laws about something they can never experience  --  pregnancy . " Now , Governor Cuomo is not , to the best of our knowledge , a dwarf ( no one has yet announced for the 1992 Democratic nomination ) ; nor has he ever been a dwarf . Furthermore , we devoutly believe that he has never tossed a dwarf , nor bowled one . So why the double standard ? With legalized dwarf-tossing , would n't those of us who find the practice abhorrent still " have a right to live by that belief " while the rest of our free society went on promiscuously tossing or , as individual conscience dictated , bowling dwarfs ? And what about the tragedies of back-alley dwarf-tossing ? Since we clearly lack a national consensus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross state lines to toss dwarfs ? When it comes to lines , however , we draw one ourselves . No federal or state funding for dwarf tossers . This is one for the private sector . " Marshall was named to the Supreme Court simply because he was black , " William O. Douglas wrote in his memoir The Court Years , " and in the 1960s that was reason enough . " Different time , different litmus test . <p>
