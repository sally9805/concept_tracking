When I was fifteen years old , my best friend got pregnant . Her name was Hope ( so christened because her mother , who spent a lot of time alone , had been out at the movies when her water broke , watching a Hope Lange film called The Best of Everything ) . The only people Hope told about her pregnancy were me and an old babysitter , who borrowed four hundred dollars from a friend at school . She told Hope not to worry . Lots of girls in college got pregnant , she said , and according to her environmental ethics professor , there was a serious overpopulation problem , anyway . <p> Hope and I were inseparable back then , but we drifted apart after college , when one of us decided to leave our hometown to find work in the nonprofit sector , and the other decided to stay put and play tennis . ( This is , I realize , not a very nice way of saying we lost touch . ) Last summer , though , almost ten years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd come home to help my mother . My dad had left her for another woman eighteen months before , and after almost two years of eating cereal dinners in front of the TV , Mom had decided to move . I 'd come home to help pack the last of her things , and I 'd stopped by Westport Spirits for some boxes . The store clerkan older , watery-eyed man with a cleft palate-brought me several from the back . He removed the collapsible , cardboard dividers inside the boxes and dusted them off with a cloth . Then he shuffled away . The soles of his tennis shoes squeaked against the floor . <p> " Thank you ! " I called . A moment later I heard my name . <p> I turned to see Hope charging down the beer aisle toward me , holding a bottle of Chivas Regal high between her hands like she might bowl a strike with it . She wore a short , white dress-filmy enough to expose the outline of a white , crocheted bikini . Her black hair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding out her arms . She 'd been swimming . Her green eyes were red-rimmed from the chlorine . I have seen maybe three truly beautiful women in my life . One I glimpsed on a street in Paris , the other I saw in an airport in New York . Hope is the third . Her beauty made so many people stand back from her , growing up , that she developed an almost unnatural reliance on our friendship ; it once caused her uncle to corner her out in their four-car garage during a family reunion , reach for her face , then pound the hood of her father 's Audi and tell her he was in love with her . <p> " Hope , " I said , dropping the boxes to hug her . <p> " You dog ! You did n't tell me you were going to be in town ! " <p> Behind her , the storefront window was decorated with emerald magnums of champagne , and the sky outside was pale-the blanched , baby-blue of late-summer . <p> " It was kind of last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't know if you know . " <p> She gave me a lopsided smile . " I heard , " she said . " I 'm sorry . " <p> Of course , she 'd heard . Everyone had . <p> She asked about my job , plowing ahead before I could answer . " For God 's sake , do n't ask me what I 'm doing . I 'm so goddamn pitiful . You 'd laugh if you knew . This past winter I was working in a sweater store . A sweater store , Bethie . Part-time , no less . " That same smilelike a slender , felled S-crossed her face , and for a moment she had trouble meeting my eyes . Then she went on , " So , what 's been happening in the hometown that I can tell you about ? My fiance dumped me . That was news . " <p> Although I had n't seen Hope in almost four years , I had heard about this . Since my father left , I 'd been travelling home from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us would sit up late at night on her bed-a huge , cauliflower-like bloom of pillows behind usand we 'd talk about the tragedies in other people 's lives , always circling predictably back to our own . On one of these evenings , Mom had relayed the story of a neighborhood lawn party , where she 'd seen Hope and her fiance , Hunter Brice . There 'd been some sort of scene . Cursing . A Bloody Mary thrown against the side of a white clapboard house . Mom shook her head at the end of the story . " So sad . So sad , " she said , and I remember sensing that the genuinely sad part of the story was something she was about to tell me . But by then we were back to my father-or , rather , the woman he 'd left her for . The Skinny-Waisted She-Bitch from the deepest reaches of hell . The Great Horned Homewrecker of the Western World . <p> I put my hand on Hope 's elbow . " It 's good to see you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of the store clerk . He stood a few feet away , next to a plastic treasure chest filled with Mardi Gras beads and marked-down bottles of rum . He stared at us . <p> " Hi , Irving , " Hope called . <p> He nodded and held up his hand . <p> " Are you gearing up for the Beaujolais Nouveau season ? " she asked . " Summer 's as good as over . " <p> Irving nodded . I could hear him breathe from several feet away . <p> " Lots of work ? " Hope said . <p> " Loth , " said Irving , proudly . " Loth . Loth . Loth . " He walked down the aisle away from us and stopped at a wine rack that covered the entire back wall of the store . He began plugging new bottles into the empty cradles of space , looking over his shoulder every once in a while , to see if we were watching . Hope obliged him , nodding at his efforts . Then she turned back to me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it appearing in her hand . She thumbed a stick forward . " How about you ? " she said . " Any husband ? " <p> I shook my head . " I was living with a guy named Bryan Adams for a while , if you can believe that , but it did n't work out . " <p> " You mean ' Everything I Do , I Do It For You ' was all a big sham ? " Hope said . " You mean he was lying ? " <p> I smiled . <p> " What happened ? " <p> Not long after my father left my mother , I 'd become hung up on the idea that Bryan was cheating on me . It started out as a joke . If he was especially polite to a waitress , I 'd give him a little kick under the table and say , " Go for it . " Before long , though , I was accusing him of sleeping with an ex-girlfriend . Finally one night ( after he 'd defended himself for the hundred-thousandth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move out , anyway . At first , he would n't go . He tried to joke about it . " You 're like a walking witch trial , " he said . " What am I , Goody Adams , here ? " He tried to put his arms around me . So I brought up things he did in bed and disparaged them . I told him his work-and the stories he told about it-had bored me from the beginning . I told him I hated looking at the droopy curve of his ear when I sat next to him during car trips . <p> " So ? " Hope said . <p> " Irreconcilable differences , " I told her . <p> She paused for a moment , eyeing me , before folding her stick of gum into her mouth . " I heard you were engaged to him . Mrs. Fielding said she met him last Christmas . " <p> I waved this away with my hand . <p> " Thirty-three and single-the both of us , " Hope said . She took a step closer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond of our early childhood . <p> " Hunter 's getting married tomorrow , " she whispered . I raised my eyebrows at her . Not only had Hunter been Hope 's fiance for an inordinate amount of time ( eight years ) , he was also the boy who 'd gotten her pregnant when we were kids . I remembered the three of usHope , our old baby-sitter , and myself-waiting for him in the reception area of the Waterbury Health Clinic where Hope was scheduled to have her abortion . The room had a rainbow-sherbet color scheme . The receptionist-peeved at the delay-wore a chunky silver ring on her middle finger that she kept twisting around and around . When Hunter finally showed up he was carrying a bunch of pink and white roses wrapped in a cone of florist 's paper that had the logo " Start Something With Flowers " scrolled across it . He could n't look any of us in the eye . <p> " Wow , " I said , shaking my head . " Married . " <p> " Be my date ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course I 'm going ! " She gave a loud laugh and I was jolted by the sudden volume in her voice . Several people in the check-out line turned around and I found that I was-suddenly , and for reasons I could n't quite pin down-embarrassed . " Come on , Bethie , " Hope said . She reached under the fold of her dress and adjusted her bikini bottom . " At least if you come there 'll be two of us grannies out there , vying for the bouquet . " <p> At first , I said no . I had the move to think about . Two days before , Mom called me at my office in Boston . I was working for a refugee resettlement agency then . The walls around our work spaces were vinyl and putty-colored , and rolled forward and back on tracked wheels in the ceiling . Accordion walls , they were called . <p> " I do n't know what got into me , " Mom said , as I rubbed the tip of an eraser against the wooden surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the enemy . " She was referring to the Men of Steel Moving Company , who we 'd hired to relocate her . I 'd planned to be with her on moving day , but for over two years my office had been trying to get a certain group of children out of Laos , and word had finally come through that they were in the air and on their way . <p> " What happened , Mom ? " I said . <p> No answer . <p> " Mom ? " I said . " Were the movers uncooperative ? " <p> " No . They were fine . They took care of everything . Even the small things . The saki set . Those little jade apples on the window sill in the kitchen . " <p> " Well , what happened ? " <p> A brief pause . " How on God 's green earth could men that burly move so fast ? " she said . " The whole house in one day . . . " <p> I waited . <p> " They do call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Another pause . <p> " Do n't they ? " I said . <p> More silence . <p> " Mom ? " <p> My assistant opened the door and held out a fan of **27;232;TOOLONG forms . I shook a finger at my in-box . <p> " I still ca n't believe your father . I could just brain him- " <p> " Mom . Just tell me what happened . " <p> She sighed . " Basically , sweetheart , when the movers got to the study I told them they had to stop . " <p> " What do you mean ? " I watched my assistant pause in the doorway to my office . She stepped out of her sandal and rubbed her foot against the carpet . She had a habit of stroking her neck and her shoulders-of wandering down the hall to gaze at the black and white photographs in the reception area-just when all hell was starting to break loose . The incoming call light on my phone began pulsing as Mom explained that she ordered the movers out of the house threequarters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew to my aunt 's in South Carolina . <p> " I 'm going to have to fly back home and face them again this weekend , " Mom said . " They 're coming back for the rest of it . I 'm sure they 've got some great nickname for me . Mrs. Nutter-brain , or something . " <p> " I 'll go , " I said . And so I travelled home , and when I pulled into the driveway two days later , I saw the dining room table sitting out on the front lawn . <p> " I 've really got to hunker down and get some packing done tomorrow , " I told Hope , as we walked out into the parking lot . " But why do n't you swing by after the reception and tell me how it went ? " <p> We said goodbye , and I drove home with every intention of getting to work . But the job was harder to start than I imagined . I walked through the downstairs , bouncing an Old Crow box against my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stenciled garlands of Dad 's favorite things around the ceiling of every room in the house : golf tees in the mud room ; chili peppers in the kitchen ; cookie-cutter fish she claimed were brook trout in the study . The job took months . She began to run out of workable design ideas-the difficulty of rendering cold beer and rack of lamb became all too clear-and most of the upstairs rooms ended up with more generic patterns : hearts , pears , braided chains of ivy . <p> I had been home for part of Mom 's stencilling marathon . One night , while she painted out in the kitchen , Dad and I sat in the TV room watching a wildlife documentary . The narrator was describing how the octopus , because it lacked an endoskeleton , could make breathtaking getaways through a mere inch or two of space . <p> " Someone want to give me a hand in here ? " Mom called . Dad sighed . He was a year into his affair by then , though neither Mom nor I knew this at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We both looked at each other , then Dad pushed himself up off the couch . " This place is starting to feel like a goddamned gingerbread house , " he said . <p> In the dining room , I stopped , dropped the box , and kicked it around the floor . Above me , the room 's stencilled border showed a tiny golfer in one of four stages of a swing : club raised behind him ; club striking down ; the turn of his hips after contact ; and a final , prayerful , over-the-shoulder gaze skyward . The pattern was repeated over and over , forming a spidery-looking wave around the ceiling . Not exactly an appropriate choice for a dining room . But Mom used coral and bronze-colored paints that complemented the room . Every fourth panel-at the end of the golfer 's swing-she painted shimmering gold-leaf stars that sprayed out from the end of his raised club and spread across the ceiling , forming constellations . It was so beautiful it hurt to look at . I remembered the sight of her , straddling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape star maps to the ceiling to trace from . The maps were made of an onionskin-type paper that kept ripping away from the tape and spiralling down to the floor . Mom slapped her hands against the ceiling , trying to hold the maps up . Her neck was bent back at a painful-looking angle ; there was paint in her hair , on her face , streaked across the seat of her pants . <p> A week later , Bryan and I lay on the floor , staring up at the finished job . We 'd been engaged for four months . Bryan had driven down from Boston for the weekend to look at reception halls with me . The night was hot and rainy . My parents were out at a dinner party . We dragged sofa cushions and a six-pack of beer into the empty dining room and stared up at the false sky . <p> " How about if we do the same thing in a nursery ? " he 'd said . After I broke things off , Bryan sublet an apartment across the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night : STILL IN LOVE WITH DELUSIONAL EX-GIRLFRIEND-PLEASE ADVISE and CALL ME NOW . <p> One night , though , when I stood up on the toilet on top of a phone book to see his latest message , which I did most evenings with the lights off , I saw his apartment had been emptied out . Two days later , an older , short-haired woman moved in with garbage bags full of clothes still on their hangers . She hung a spider fern in the window , blocking my view , and that was the end of my voyeur period . <p> " He 's given up , " a mutual friend of ours told me . " He said the only thing he 's waiting for from here on out is a Red Sox pennant win . He looks pretty bad , Beth . " <p> I looked up at Mom 's painted sky . Outside , two bicyclists rode by ; I heard one yell to the other . I wanted to call Bryan then . I felt it in my shins , an ache that ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and a half of living with him-could still strike this tension inside me . It was terrifying ; no one had ever gotten inside my body like that . <p> I looked out the window . A breeze blew through the tops of the trees . It stirred the leaves , lifting their paler undersides to the sky . I kicked the Old Crow box out into the front hall , walked into the kitchen , and rested my cheek against the phone , which was hanging alone in the middle of the bare wall . I rubbed my arms to warm up ; at the same time , my forehead was sweating . I dialed and hung up , dialed and hung up . Then I made a local call . " I take it back , " I said to Hope , who picked up on the first ring . " Let 's go . Let 's have some fun . " <p> She picked me up the next morning , just after the Men of Steel showed up . She got out of the car to throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of the movers raise their eyebrows at one another . Hope was wearing a short , fitted white dress that had a gossamer flounce around her hips-like the skirt on a nineteentwenties bathing suit . <p> " White to a wedding ? " I said , sliding into the passenger seat . <p> " It 's not white . It 's **25;261;TOOLONG . " <p> I raised an eyebrow . <p> " Or opal . You might call it opal , " Hope said . <p> I gave her a look . <p> " All right , it 's white , " she said . " But it 's the only color that looks good on me these days , so let 's just forget about it , can we ? " <p> That Hope had chosen to wear white to Hunter 's wedding was somewhat appropriate , considering they 'd lost their virginity together and had , for as long as I 'd known them , been magnetically drawn . Once , during college , Hope thought he 'd gotten her pregnant a second time , and she showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer with thorny black caterpillars of mascara under her eyes . " Oh my God , " she said , grabbing pamphlets off the card table I sat at and balling them up one-handedly . The women I worked with looked up from their desks ( women who were graying and serious-minded and seemed largely unhappy to me then ) . I pulled Hope into the Xerox room and shut the door . Tacked to the wall behind her were CARE posters of impoverished children . Hope tugged hard on my arm . " What is it about him ? " she sobbed . " I let it happen again . " <p> I shook my head . " How could you not have used protection ? " I said , which made her cry harder . We went across the street to a frozen ice cream place . After a while , Hope stopped crying . Her turret of vanilla collapsed on its side . I thumbnailed a few rainbow sprinkles lying on the table that had been left by the people before us . I was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnancy seemed doubtful ( " Sometimes hot weather like this can make you stop ovulating all together , " and " Did n't Hunter drop acid at the Allman Brothers concert last year ? I bet his sperm count 's down " ) . Hope stared at me with her head tilted to one side , nodding . " You 're very controlled , are n't you , Bethie ? " she said . There was nothing unkind or critical in her voice . Still , her observation took me by surprise . I 've never forgotten the hollow way those words made me feel ; the emptiness that can strike in me now , when I think about them . <p> Hope pulled the car up onto a grassy plot of church property , between stakes tied with ribbon and baby 's breath . Her hands trembled against the steering wheel . I pretended not to notice , then asked , " Are you going to be all right with this ? " <p> " Well , it 's not as close as I would 've liked , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least we 'll be the first ones out after the ceremony . " <p> The day was stunning . Sunlight flared against the roofs of cars and fell in a fat arch across the face of the church . Inside , Hope and I sat in the second-to-last row . We watched Hunter confer with his best man under a brown and mauve stained-glass window . Hope 's hands were still shaking and she slid them under her thighs . <p> " Why are you so nervous ? " I whispered . <p> " I 'm not , " she whispered back , as the music started . <p> The bride , whose name was Kendra , was a pale , blond girl ( twentythree at the most ) , whose backless dress cowled down so low in the back that the dimpled umlaut of skin just above her buttocks-and the tops of her buttocks themselves-were visible . <p> " I promise to be your lover , " she said during the vows , and Hope pinched the inside of my wrist . <p> " She 's actually a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us in the receiving line . She was a long-bosomed woman in a navy blue dress who bred Labrador retrievers for a living . " Utterly guileless , " she said . " Off in her own world a lot of the time , but the Brices will forgive it . They 'll forgive everything : the dress , the vows , that feathered ankle bracelet she 's wearing . " She went on to explain that the bride came from an Art World family , whose canvassed assets dwarfed the Brice fortune garnered in vending machine distribution . <p> At the reception , which was held at the Westport Botanical Society , Hope and I danced with the brothers of the bride . They had pony-tails-short ones-and wore expensive ties . The friendlier of the two flirted with me in the hopes of getting Hope 's attention . He was shorter than his brother . He told me I looked like a blond Louise Brooks . <p> " But Louise Brooks was Louise Brooks because of her dark hair , " said Hope , handing me a shot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most beautiful woman at the reception , but she 'd always been sensitive to the question of blonds . <p> " You say that because you have an unsophisticated eye , " the short brother-in-law challenged . " Color is immaterial . Try looking at the negative space around something , not the thing itself . " He held up his hand and stared at it , spreading his fingers slowly . <p> The tall brother rolled his eyes . <p> Hope was on her third drink and her face was flushed . " I want to have the time of my life at this party , " she said . " I want to get drunk and dance barefoot in the fountain back there-splash it up with somebody 's great uncle . " <p> " I 'll take you dancing , " the shorter brother-in-law said . " We 'll be the Mastroianni and Eckberg of suburban Connecticut . " He waited for Hope 's reaction . When he did n't get one he said , " From La Dolce Vita . Have you seen it ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It 's a little overrated as Fellini goes . I still say La Strada is his best , but you should really see it . " Then , a look of concern : " Have you seen any of Fellini 's work ? " <p> " No , I have n't . " <p> " Quelle surprise , " the tall one said quietly . <p> " What do you do ? " the short brother-in-law asked Hope . " Wait . Do n't tell me . You 've just signed on with Click modelling agency . <p> " She has to be a model , " he said to his brother , who gave him a thin smile . " Does n't she ? " <p> " Do you know the average age of a working model in this country ? " the taller brother said . " Sixteen . No offense , " he added , turning to Hope . <p> " What about Lauren Hutton ? " the short one said . <p> " Lauren Hutton 's a troll . " <p> Hunter walked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to face the band , who were playing a dirgelike rendition of " Wonderful Tonight . " She clasped her hands behind her back and braided her fingers together . Hunter was thinner than I remembered him . The Labrador retriever woman had mentioned something about him contracting pinkeye , and up close , you could see she was right . This , along with his crew cut , gave him a skullish look-a starved handsomeness . I 'd always liked Hunter . When we were young , the three of us would tour aimlessly around in Hope 's white Rabbit with cans of Bud and strawberry wine coolers between our knees . Hope insisted Hunter drive at all times , and she would cup her hands over the stick shift and whisper things I could n't hear into his neck , below his ear . Hunter was always more including . " Hey , Betty , " he 'd say , locking eyes with me in the rearview mirror . " You sleeping back there ? " <p> He kissed my cheek and said , " Long time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His left eye was watering . " I 've been apologizing to Kendra all day for showing her up , " Hunter said , wiping his cheek against his shoulder . " The World 's First Weeping Bridegroom . " His brothers-in-law stared at him , expressionless . <p> " You 're not the first man in history to cry at a wedding , " Hope said , without looking at him . " So do n't go getting all proud of yourself . " <p> Hunter stared evenly at the side of her face . " Thanks for keeping me in check , Mrs. Munro , " he said . Behind him , his new wife was spinning around on the dance floor alone , smiling to herself . The sharp darts of her breasts and hip bones looked like they might cut through her dress . <p> " You always said you wanted a small wedding , " Hope went on , not looking at him . She motioned for another drink . <p> " Kendra and I made a compromise , " Hunter told her . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I guess it 's an adult relationship , Hope . " <p> " Adult ? " Hope laughed . " She 's sixteen . " <p> " She 's twenty-two . " <p> " Oh , well ! " Hope said , turning to me . " Twenty-two . Well , then she 's a regular Margaret Mead-a regular woman of the world . " <p> " We were just saying that your friend Hope must be a model , " the shorter brother-in-law cut in . <p> After a pause , Hunter , clearly annoyed , looked at me . <p> " And if she is n't , then she could be . " <p> Out on the dance floor , a group of the bride 's friends encircled her , joined hands , and undulated in and out like some massive dividing cell of silk organza . Kendra ran her hands up and down the front of her dress . Several people whistled and called Hunter 's name , but he did n't hear them . <p> " Am I right ? " the shorter brother said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened his mouth to say something , then looked down at the floor . Hope 's eyes took on that full-pupilled wideness I 'd always associated with dolls in airport gift shops and I knew she was a moment away from crying . <p> " Sure , she could be a model , " Hunter said gently . <p> " Oh , thanks for throwing me that bone , Hunter , " Hope said . She turned to me again . " I tell him he 's my best friend , and he tells me I could be a model . " She started to cry . The brothers-in-law exchanged looks . <p> " Hope , " said Hunter , quietly . He stepped towards her and held out his hand . She slapped it away . <p> " Traitor , " Hope said . <p> He threw up his hands . " You lie to me for six years running and I 'm the traitor ? " <p> A tide of bridesmaids surged up from behind Hunter then . They grabbed him and pulled him toward Kendra , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expose a garter that was hitched so high on her thigh that Hunter 's mother-seemingly engrossed in conversation in the corner-yelled " Kendra ! " <p> Hope watched a ring of people converge on Hunter , blocking him from our view . <p> " You want to know what I do ? " Hope said , turning on the brothers-in-law . " I sell sweaters . I contribute absolutely nothing to society-at-large . I stand around all day and talk about the washability of chenille . " <p> The tall brother-in-law leaned in to hear her . An amused smile crossed his face . <p> " I 'm having fun , " Hope said . " I like folding cardigans . I like argyle sweater vests . I like anticipating the high point of my day , which is when we all order grilled shrimp and watercress sandwiches from The Lunchbox Cafe . " Hope turned and left us , pushing past a bunch of bridesmaids in a group hug . The taller brother-in-law smiled to himself and shook his head . The short one stared at Hope 's ass as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he sighed . <p> I trailed after Hope . In the arboretum , I scanned the room with no luck . A trio of my mother 's friends saw me and waved me over . They were sitting around a small wrought-iron table , talking in low tones about the bride 's dress-a conversation that eventually led to descriptions of their own . Wedding gowns , they called them , which struck me as an odd word-a word on its way to extinction . Mrs. Fielding took my hand and petted it . <p> " Where 's that adorable fiance of yours ? " she asked . The other two women stopped talking . <p> I held up my hands . <p> " Did you bring him ? " <p> All three of them nodded expectantly . <p> My voice , when I answered , was light , but I felt a constriction through my chest . " I let him get away , " I said . <p> " No , " Mrs. Fielding said . She lifted her hands to her cheeks and shook her head back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . All three of them sat there , shaking their heads at me . " Oh , Beth , " Mrs. Fielding said . Then her voice got low . " How 's your mother ? " <p> " Fine , " I said , quickly . " I 'm looking for Hope Munro . Have any of you seen her ? " <p> The women raised their eyebrows at one another , then Mrs. Fielding took my hand and squeezed it . " Do n't worry , " she said . " Your mother will come through this all right . She 's got resilience . That 's the one thing God gave us ladies in spades . " She looked to her friends for confirmation . They nodded in unison . <p> I searched for Hope through the gardens outside . I checked the ladies ' bathrooms . I walked out to the parking lot to see if her car was still there . The white antique limousine that carried Hunter and Kendra to the reception was parked along the curb . The door in back was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way doors on oldfashioned cars sometimes do . Hunter was sitting alone inside , pinching drops into his eyes . When he finished , he sat blinking at the empty driver 's seat in front of him . He turned and saw me a moment later and got out of the car . <p> " I 'm sorry , " I said , as he came up next to me . " I did n't mean to interrupt you . " We gazed out at the topiary sculptures dotting the lawn : a bear , a dolphin , Atlas shouldering the world . " I lost Hope , " I said . " I came out here to look for her . " <p> " We all lost Hope somewhere down the line , " he said . " Try the bar . " <p> I felt tired all of a sudden , like I needed to sit down . " The bar ?

' I told them I 'm tired of all this talk about alcoholism being a disease . It 's not a disease . It 's not a genetic inheritance . It 's not some launching pad to the Great Twelve Steps of Enlightened Living . It 's a weakness , that 's all . " Hunter 's jaw was set . He wiped the dust off his hands . " So onward and upward .

It was a letter she 'd recorded , telling me why she was glad she was marrying me , giving a few hints about what her dress looked like , " he said . " And I forgot . I completely forgot . " <p> " Things are always crazy just before a wedding , " I said . <p> Hunter shook his head . <p> " You should n't worry about it , " I said . <p> Right then , one of the guests-a white-haired man in a seersucker suit-strode by us on his way to the parking lot . " Good show , son , " he called to Hunter , who nodded back . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine . <p> " Do you ever get the feeling that it 's easier to be with someone you 're not as in love with ? " Hunter said . <p> I thought about the way he 'd looked at Hope , while his new wife danced obliviously behind him . I thought about Bryan in Boston , and my parents with hundreds of miles between them ; and it occurred to me , as it has many times before and since , that love-the thing we 're so encouraged to hunt down and protect and hold out for-is a force to be feared . <p> Before I could answer , someone yelled " Hunter ! " from behind us . It was his mother . She waved him inside with a beaded purse that matched her pale green suit . " What are you doing out here ? ! " she called in what was somehow both a whisper and a yell . <p> Hunter did n't move . <p> " Hunter ! " she said , taking a few steps toward us . <p> He rolled his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , smiling . <p> I watched him walk away . He passed through the building 's entrance , which had leafy stonework bordering the door . " Hunter , " I called , and he stopped and laid his hand against the doorframe . The sunlight turned his hand pink ; the rest of his body was shadowed inside . " I know exactly what you mean , " I called . <p> When I found Hope , she was standing at the edge of the dance floor , arguing with one of the bride 's aunts . A framed illustration of a mustard plant hung on the wall between them . Its roots were rendered in charcoal and looked like a limp , hanging hand . <p> " I just do n't think it 's very appropriate , " whispered the aunt-a tall woman , whose salt-and-pepper hair was bobbed dramatically , the left side several inches longer than the right . <p> " I 'm sorry , " Hope said . <p> " White to a wedding .... It just seems like a very obvious ploy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " That would be impossible , " Hope said , fingering the rim of her empty rocks glass . " Considering she 's naked . " <p> The aunt drew her breath in . " Jealous girl , " she said . She threw the longer side of her hair over her shoulder and turned to me . " Get her out of here , " she said . <p> Back at my house , the movers were gone . They 'd taken everything and left a business card under the knocker on the front door that said MEN OF STEEL : ABLE TO CLEAR TALL BUILDINGS WITHOUT A SINGLE FROWN . We went out to the back yard and sat down on the grass in the last diamond of sunlight . I 'd bought some sandwiches on the way home and while I wolfed mine down , Hope took hers apart and threw pieces of mayonnaisey onion into the flower beds behind us . We joked about our ouster-the crooked aunt , we called her-but I think deep down we both felt bad for having been thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hope said . <p> " Me neither . Too many thank you notes to write afterward . " But what I was thinking was : Too big of a chance he 'll cheat on you . I sipped my Diet Coke . <p> " If that 's Hunter 's wife 's idea of a wedding dress , imagine what she 'll wear to his company Christmas party . Probably a thong and sequined nipple hats . " She lay back on the grass . Daylight was fading , and the gray shingled side of the house looked violet . " Look , " she said , pointing to a group of fireflies glowing down by the edge of our property . She stood up . " Let 's go collect them , " she said , pulling me up by the wrists . <p> The sky was layered : salmon through the trees , indigo above them . I followed her down the lawn and cupped my hands around the first firefly I came to . God made them slow for children , I 've always thought . Hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireflies . " Who needs men with all this natural wonder in the world ? " she said . " Right , Bethie ? Who needs them ? " but there was no conviction in her voice and she slumped down onto the grass and crossed her arms over her chest . <p> " He quit on me , " she said , rocking back and forth . <p> I crouched down next to her . <p> " You quit on old cars and broken TV sets , " she said . " Not people . " <p> I put my arm around her . " Who needs him , Hopie ? " I said . " What do you want with some soppy-eyed preppy who 's still taking orders from his mother ? Come on . " <p> Hope gave me a sidewise glance . " I wish I was more like you , Beth , " she said . " I think I 'd have an easier time of it . " Her hands were shaking and I noticed now that there was a tremulous quality to the movement-that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the church , but her body trying to hold still against what she was doing to it . She stood up and said , " I have to make a phone call . " I watched her canter across the lawn . " I 'm using my car phone ! " she yelled back over her shoulder . " I wo n't be long ! " <p> When she came back her plaid thermos swung from her pointer finger . It turned out there was bourbon inside . " Look what I found hiding in the back seat , " she said , folding down next to me and knocking over my tumbler of Coke . " Let 's sweeten those sodas , what do you say ? Let 's have a good time . " There were grass stains on the seat of her dress . " So I called my friend Martin , " she said . " He 's going to take us out . " <p> Next door , the neighbor 's porch light went on . I saw Mrs. Stewart shoo their golden retriever out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Hope sighed . " Martin 's hilarious , " she said . " He 's spoiled and pretentious and brags way too much about his movie star sister , but he makes me laugh . That 's worth a mint in my little world . " <p> A horn blared from the driveway . <p> " There he ith , " Hope slurred . <p> The horn sirened again and Hope rose to her feet . She stood above me for a moment , kneading her toes against the grass . " Come on , " she snapped , before her tone changed completely to a lilty drawl . " Come and meet Martin . " She turned and ran up the lawn . <p> When I came around the side of the house a few moments later , Martin was standing next to his idling car , trying to light a match against his belt buckle . He swiped the matchstick against the brass , then stared down at his fly as though it held all the mysteries of the world . His white-blond hair was parted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked like he 'd been one of those fat , sharptongued children who can reduce their mothers to tears in social situations . He wore a pale yellow sweater vest with a white T-shirt underneath that bunched around his armpits . <p> " Try the tarmac , " I said , nodding at the match in his hand . <p> " The what ? " <p> " The driveway . " <p> Martin looked down at his fly again . With enormous concentration , he jerked his hand downward and the match sparked . He smirked . <p> " Do your thing and let 's get out of here , " he called to Hope , who was out in the front yard , crouching by a tree . I could just make out the white blur of her dress . She came back , tugging on her underwear . <p> " Let 's go , " Martin said . <p> Hope waved me toward the car . <p> I shook my head . <p> " We ca n't stay here , Bethie , " she said , looking behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's empty . <p> " The movers , " she explained to Martin , " they took it all away . " But he had already swung down into his Saab and was gunning the engine . <p> " Someone should tell that guy to invest in a motorcycle , " I said . " He looks ridiculous revving a four-door . " <p> " He is ridiculous , " Hope said . " Martin 's got the soul of a raisin . " <p> We smiled at one another . Hope tried to look sober . She stood with her head held high and her legs pressed together , but her right knee trembled , on the verge of buckling . I walked over to her and hugged her . I thought back to a night maybe twenty years before . Hope had come over to spend the night , and-after prodding a plastic pointer around the surface of a Ouija board till we were bored and brought down by the growing understanding that mystery in life was neither as prevalent or as overt as we 'd thought-Hope offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , this meant I would have to show her my own , and I made some excuse about forgetting where I 'd hidden it . " That 's okay . You can still read mine , " Hope said . My father appeared in the doorway then , demanding lights out for the third time that night . We listened to him wait in the hallway then head back to my parents , bedroom . Hope said , " We can read them by the lights of our curling irons . " We crawled over to an outlet in the corner of my room and sat close together with our backs against the legs of my vanity table . We held the hot wands over the pages , their tiny orange " on " lights illuminating one word at a time . <p> I hugged Hope harder , remembering this , then started to pull away . But she would n't let go . I patted her back . " Remember Waterbury ? " she whispered in my ear . This had been our code word for Hope 's abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or Termination at Eight Weeks , as her release form had read . Waterbury . When I nodded the back of her pearl earring scratched my cheek . <p> " I 'm sure he was a boy , " Hope said . " I do n't know how I know that . He would 've been eighteen this year . " She took a step back from me , looked into my eyes , and said , " You 're dying for a screwdriver . I can tell . " <p> When I shook my head she grabbed my face and kissed me . " Byebye , granny , " she said . She got in the car with Martin and I watched them pull out of the driveway . <p> After they 'd gone , I walked out into the back yard to the pool . Its cover was dotted with leaves and rabbit droppings , and I took it off and kicked it out into the yard . I walked down the pool steps and down the smooth blue slide of its decline . In the deep end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The moon was a pale rind above me , netted by stars , and it was n't long before the neighbor 's dog 's head appeared over the pool 's edge . His metal tags jangled above me , and his snout appeared and reappeared at different points around the pool . When he started whining I whispered , " Quiet , baby . Quiet , boy . " I did n't know his name . I looked up at the box of sky above me and tried to remember where Hope and Hunter had buried their baby . It occurred to me in the very same moment , of course , that he had n't been buried anywhere-a thought that frightened me out of the pool and up onto the grass where the neighbor 's dog was still crying . I sat down next to him and stroked his coat . The house-with all its curtains gone-looked toothy and strange . Through the kitchen window I could see the phone hanging on the bare wall . I did n't think of Bryan at first , I thought of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the lawn to the house , my eyes set on the tiny rectangle of phone as if to look away from it would make it disappear all together . <p>
