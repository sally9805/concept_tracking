Victim Doreen Orion writes the book on stalking // Ever get the feeling you 're being followed ? You 're not alone . According to recent statistics , 8 percent of all women and 2 percent of all men in the U.S. are victims of stalkers at some point in their lives . And once a stalker fixates on you , it 's hard to break free . While every state has passed antistalking legislation , " in many , a first offense is only a misdemeanor , " says Dr. Doreen R. Orion , author of a new book , I Know You Really Love Me : A Psychiatrist 's Journal of Erotomania , Stalking and Obsessive Love . For Orion , 37 , a psychiatrist and faculty member at the University of Colorado Health Services Center in Boulder , stalking is more than just a professional concern . In 1989 , after completing her residency at the University of Arizona in Tucson , she spent 16 days counseling a 38-year-old part-time insurance agent referred to her by Timothy Justice , an associate director at the Tucson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a love note the next day , and Orion 's life has n't been the same since . Fran Nightingale ( not her real name ) tormented Orion with constant notes and phone calls , violated restraining orders and followed her and Justice when they moved to Louisville , Colo. , in 1993 ( the couple wed in 1995 ) . " She stole my sense of security , " says Orion , who diagnosed Nightingale 's obsession as erotomania , the delusion that one is loved by another . Frustrated by her own powerlessness , Orion says she wrote I Know You Really Love Me " as a resource for other victims . " The book may antagonize her stalker-who is serving a one-year jail term for twice breaking a probation order issued after she disobeyed a restraining order eight times-but Orion is willing to take that chance . " I spent years doing everything the courts and the police told me to do , and seeing nothing work , " she says . " Writing the book put me in touch with other victims and stalking experts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move on , " says Dr. Doreen Orion ( at home in Colorado with cat Morty ) . " And I certainly hope my stalker does too . " // Orion , who has a medical degree from George Washington University and is working with Colorado legislators to toughen the state 's antistalking laws , shared her knowledge with correspondent Vickie Bane . Is stalking more common than it used to be ? I 'm not sure if it 's more common or we 're just hearing more about it . Our society is more mobile , making it easier for people with obsessive impulses to act on them . A woman in the old world may have had a crush on Napoleon , but she could n't have gone after him easily . Are all stalkers erotomanic ? Studies say that at least 10 percent are " pure " erotomanics , meaning the only condition they have is the delusion that this person loves them ; otherwise they appear to be normal . But between 50 and 90 percent of stalkers are mentally ill , and some of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not all are erotomanic , though . Some feel they are being persecuted by their victims or , in the case of those who stalk politicians , may be angry at them . Is there a typical erotomanic stalker profile ? They tend to come from abusive and emotionally distant families . They are often self-conscious and lack selfesteem . Most of them work at menial jobs if they work at all . They also tend to be unmarried and unable to sustain relationships . Stalking is the only way they can experience intimacy . Are some kinds of people more likely than others to become victims ? Erotomanics tend to choose people in positions of authority , people whom they perceive as good-looking and intelligent , and older than their stalkers-somebody they can look up to . Like celebrities ? Certainly many famous people become stalking victims . Madonna , Kathie Lee Gifford , Whitney Houston , Michael J. Fox , Suzanne Somers and David Letterman have all been through it . But it happens more often to the average person , probably simply because there are more average people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Orion , " then , yes , hire security . " Madonna ( in New York City last January ) has plenty , but stalker Robert Hoskins ( below ) did n't quit . Photograph Forced to face Hoskins in court in 1996 , the Material Girl said , " I feel sick to my stomach . I 'm sitting in front of him , and that 's what he wants . " He is serving a 10-year term . Photograph In The Bodyguard , Whitney Houston had one stalker-offscreen , she has had 20 . Photograph In 1989 a stalker sent rabbit feces to Michael J. Fox and vowed to kill his wife . // Is there anything people can do to avoid being stalked ? Thirty-six percent of male victims and 23 percent of female victims are stalked by total strangers . There was a department store manager I wrote about who smiled at his customer and ended up being stalked by her . How do you guard against that ? What can you do if it happens to you ? Tell your stalker once , clearly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your stalker in any way . People unwittingly encourage stalkers by trying to reason with them . When they do that , it gives stalkers what they want , which is contact . Also you need to tell everyone you know that you are being stalked , and give them a picture of your stalker if you have one . This is so friends do n't inadvertently aid the stalker by giving out information about you . Does filing restraining orders help ? Before filing one , you need to make sure the police in your area take them seriously , that they immediately arrest the stalker for any violation instead of just saying yet again , " Do n't do that . " Is moving away a viable option ? It works sometimes but , as I 've learned , many times it does n't . Stalkers get to their victims any way they can . Why are current antistalking laws insufficient ? Too much current legislation requires that an explicit threat be made for a person to be charged with stalking . But research shows no relationship between explicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some estimates say that 25 to 30 percent of them will . What emotions do victims typically experience ? First comes denial , then anger , then mourning the loss of their security , and finally , acceptance , and integrating changes into their lives to feel safe . Stalking has a profound effect on people . My husband and I decided not to have children partly because I was being stalked . How could I ever let a kid play in the yard without worrying ? Are there support groups for victims ? Yes , in the back of my book I list organizations . They can be extremely helpful , not only to give emotional support but also because they can give you information about laws in your area and counseling centers . When do most stalkings end ? Unfortunately , when the erotomanic moves on to another victim . The stalker who killed actress Rebecca Schaeffer first stalked Debbie Gibson and Tiffany , and even when he was in jail for Schaeffer 's murder , he was fixating on Dyan Cannon . It 's tragic that often the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixate on someone else .
