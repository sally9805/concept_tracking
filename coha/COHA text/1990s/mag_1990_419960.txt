Section : INTERNATIONAL Democracy movements spread to Africa but is pluralism the cure for chronic poverty ? <p> It was a week of ferment below the Sahara . In the Kenyan capital of Nairobi , a protest against one-party rule ended in looting and at least 20 deaths . From Somalia came reports of government troops opening fire in a soccer stadium after fans stoned the president ; 66 people were confirmed dead . Liberian ruler Samuel K. Doe was under rebel siege in his seafront mansion . Meanwhile , in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , African heads of state ended the annual Organization of African Unity summit by pledging full democratization . The leaders were forced to acknowledge a new reality in sub-Saharan Africa . Inspired by the revolutions in Eastern Europe and angry at chronic corruption and economic mismanagement , their people are calling for an end to the authoritarian regimes that have ruled them , in many cases , since independence . <p> When the Berlin wall came down last fall , 38 of the 46 sub-Saharan states were led by one-party or military governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First was Tanzania 's Julius Nyerere , who helped invent " African socialism . " In February he told his impoverished countrymen that the one-party system is not necessarily " God 's wish . " The regime quickly accepted a gradual transition to pluralism . Since then there has been an epidemic of such promises , often accompanied by mass protest . Even before last week 's OAU summit , Benin , Gabon , Ivory Coast and Zaire had announced plans for multiparty systems . Nigeria 's military government promises to cede power to civilians in 1992 . Violent protests have broken out in Cameroon , Niger , Mali , Guinea and the Central African Republic . In Zambia , a failed coup on July 1 followed five days of rioting over food-price increases ; students also demanded a Western-style democracy . Finally came the upheaval in Kenya , where President Daniel was vowing last week to resist pressure for a multiparty system ( page 28 ) . <p> Pressure was building even before last year 's changes in Europe . During the 1980s , economic collapse ( chart ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The price of loans was " structural adjustment "  --  the dismantling of catastrophic central-planning systems to let real markets grow . Now the lenders are also attaching political strings to their aid . " Democracy is being presented as this season 's fashion , " complained Chadian President Hissene Habre . French President Francois Mitterrand warned last month that he will be " more lukewarm " to countries that fail to observe democratic principles ; British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd issued a similar warning . The World Bank , which controls about $12 billion of the $15 billion in aid Africa receives annually , calls for increased support but also seeks political reform . " We can look at Africa with hope that they have learned a lesson , " said Herman Cohen , the State Department 's top Africanist . " Now is the time to help . " <p> Obscene response : But aiding Africa is hard to sell . The United States has cut its bilateral aid to Africa in half since 1985 , to about $1 billion in 1990 , even though the continent contains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 times as much aid per capita from Europe and Central Americans 34 times as much from the United States , notes Cohen 's predecessor , Chester Crocker , adding : " Africans could end up paying for the expanding frontiers of freedom everywhere else . That would be an obscene response to the African crisis . " And private investment dwindled from a peak of $2.3 billion in 1982 to $600 million in 1986 . " When a building is on fire , you do n't ask someone to buy an apartment , " explained Jean-Pierre Prouteau of the Council of French Investors in Black Africa . <p> Sub-Saharan Africa 's own vital statistics are unremittingly bleak . With a population of 450 million , the region has a total gross domestic product of $135 billion  --  no more than that of Belgium , with only 10 million people . The real income of the average African has declined since 1970 . Nor is there the prospect of improvement . The region is burdened by a mountain of debt  --  $135 billion in 1988 , equal to 100 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in foreign aid Africa receives annually , an average of $9 billion goes to service debt . Meanwhile , exports are declining . World commodity prices are the lowest in decades , and Africa 's market share has declined sharply . While Africa remains rich in minerals , its production has fallen by a steady 2 percent a year . <p> The human cost is appalling . In the poorest countries-Burkina-Faso , Ethiopia and Mali-about one in four children dies before the age of 5 . More than 100 million people face chronic hunger . Two out three rural Africans do n't have clean water . AIDS has spread farther and faster in Central and East Africa than anywhere else ; the World Health Organization estimates that more than a million Africans now are infected with the virus . <p> Africa may have slipped out of the mainstream , but its problems ca n't be contained to the continent . Ecological collapse  --  increasing desertification and deforestation  --  affects the whole planet . Economic collapse would hurt banks . Immigration is a problem in several European countries . " Westerners must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are on board the same ship , " says Guy Georgy , a former French ambassador in Africa . " We can not lead the lives of millionaires on the upper deck while the hold is filled with the luckless poor ... the passengers in the hold will cut holes in the hull . " <p> What , then , can outsiders do ? It 's unclear if the latest " quick fix " - Western- style pluralism-really is a cure-all . Africa lacks democratic traditions . The political systems created at independence developed along ethnic lines . Liberia 's civil war is largely tribal ; ethnic differences fuel the Kenyan protests . Still , " tribalism can work for democracy and against a one-party monopoly , " says Cohen . An example is newly independent Namibia , where a pro-Marxist liberation movement dominated by the Ovambo tribe won a parliamentary majority last year but pledged to maintain a market economy and shares power with parties representing 13 other ethnic groups . And there are some other bright spots . Ghana enjoys roughly 6 percent growth because its military regime undertook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third try at democracy . Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe has stuck to the free-market system , though he recently told Western advocates of pluralism to " go to hell . " Botswana built a working democracy on an aboriginal tradition of local gatherings called kgotlas that resemble New England town meetings ; it has a record $2.7 billion in foreign reserves . <p> Giant market : The best hope for Africa is that the continent 's two giant economies  --  South Africa and Nigeria  --  can be harnessed to pull the rest of the countries out of the mud . A post-apartheid South Africa could drive the entire southern region . A prosperous Nigeria  --  which alone contains a quarter of all Africans  --  could carry West Africa . Together , they could become a giant market to absorb the rest of Africa 's products . But pessimists abound . A secret French study on " Crisis Scenarios in Africa " was leaked last week , warning of revolts or military coups across the continent . In Zaire , for example , President Mobutu Sese Seko " does not at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of his repeated vows not to become another Ceausescu . The road to recovery is open ; so is the path toward anarchy and chaos . But , as in Eastern Europe , there is no way back . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : New Reality : Injury at Ivory Coast protest <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Learning a hard lesson ?
