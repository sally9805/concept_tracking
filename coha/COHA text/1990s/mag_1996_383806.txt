It 's fierce , carnivorous , howls in the night , and could be in your camp . Headnote Just be glad it 's so small . // The familiar nocturnal voices of owls and coyotes help define American wilderness , especially in the West . Yet there is another nighttime call of the wild , equally common , that few backpackers lying in their tents or sitting around a snapping campfire would recognize . This call-referred to by biologists as a howl-is a high , flutelike piping barely audible to humans , though the trained ear can recognize it at 100 yards . It is the call of a carnivorous nocturnal mammal , genus Onychomys-a vicious , voracious , predatory , even cannibalistic ... mouse . Commonly known as the grasshopper mouse , Onychomys includes three species , one or more of which can be found in treeless areas from south-central Canada to northern Mexico and from California as far east as Minnesota . They are especially abundant in the semiarid Southwest . Grasshopper mice rarely exceed 6 inches in length , with abbreviated tails adding another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ounces as adults and are furred in varying shades of dun on the back and sides , with white beneath . You may have seen one but thought nothing of it because it looks like , well , just a mouse , which is precisely what makes this species so interesting . Most people assume that all small rodent-like mammals make their living gnawing seeds and other vegetable foods . But there are exceptions . Take the shrew , for example . In spite of its mousy appearance , the shrew ( genus Sorex ) is a member of the family Soricidae , the insectivores . Rather than flat , wide gnawing teeth , the pointy little snouts of shrews and other insectivores bristle with sharp teeth specially evolved to punch through and crush the shells of insect prey . But the grasshopper mouse is , indeed , a rodent and armed only with the standard Bucky Beaver choppers . Most odd , this evolutionary quirk , since the compact killer has developed so very many other carnivorous features , including heavily muscled jaws , a leathery stomach wall ( to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat-eater 's foreshortened gut . The ' hopper mouse also has stout front legs and long claws for grasping and holding its prey ( Onychomys in fact means " clawed mouse " ) , a fearless aggressiveness fueled by jumbo adrenal glands , and a large and fiercely defended hunting territory ( roughly about one acre per inch of body length ) . In short , what earns the grasshopper mouse its reputation as " the most interesting of the mouse family " and makes its howl worth listening for among all those bumps in the night is its bloody uniqueness . Or , put contrarily , its unique bloodiness . While Onychomys occasionally eats seeds and other mousy vegetation , the dietary staple of the species is freshkilled meat . Half or more is typically insect : crickets , beetles , moths , caterpillars , scorpions , tarantulas , larvae , and , of course , the namesake ' hoppers . But unlike the shrew , the grasshopper mouse is no mere bug biter . It also kills and devours lizards , fellow mammals including rats up to three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most often following a territorial dispute . In preparation for a night 's hunt , a lone grasshopper mouse emerges from its cool underground burrow , then tastes the air with its keen nose before hopping onto a log , rock , or other podium . While balancing on its hind feet with tail in an upright " Santa Fe style " coyote pose and ears pinned back , the mouse squints shut its eyes , points a pointy nose at the sky , then opens wide and issues a prolonged pip-squeak howl . On the hunt , the grasshopper mouse uses nose , ears , and big night-adapted eyes to find prey . When a meal is located , the tiny killer crouches and creeps slowly forward , just like a miniature cougar , then pounces , grasping the victim with its front claws and inflicting a lethal bite to the neck or skull . While struggling with its prey , the killer mouse pulls back its ears and squeezes shut its eyes-the latter probably for protection from its victim 's teeth , claws , or stinger . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scorpions , since researchers have observed attacking Onychomys stung repeatedly but to no apparent effect . To disarm odoremitting beetles , which are common in the desert Southwest and elsewhere , the clever hunter grasps the smelly bug and shoves its offending rump into the sand , then eats it face first . With the brief predator-prey struggle finished-the outcome is virtually assured from the moment a grasshopper mouse locates a victim-the unlikely little carnivore settles in to enjoy the fruits of its efforts . If the meat is insect , the killer generally devours the entire body , exceptions being grasshoppers and cockroaches , whose extremities are often severed and set aside . No one knows why . But should the meal be a rodent and the hunter not particularly hungry , only the brains may be consumed , likely for their precious fluids . ( Should you ever come upon a fresh little corpse thus mutilated , as I infrequently have , you can amaze your companions by predicting the most likely culprit . ) Although the howl is but one of at least half a dozen vocalizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the longest , the most intriguing , and the only one you 're likely to ever hear . While captive grasshopper mice have been observed howling prior to a hunt and after making a kill , the howl 's primary function in the wild is thought to be identification-a grasshopper mouse apparently knows other individuals of its kind by subtle distinctions in their howls , much as you and I can recognize familiar voices over the phone . Additional functions of the howl likely include courting serenades , territorial proclamations , and , I like to think , an unbridled expression of freedom and joy . Researchers who 've studied the howl say it has a remarkable acoustic signature that rises to a sustained plateau , then rapidly falls and fades away . Exactly like a wolf . Onychomys ... a ferociously predatory , uniquely carnivorous runt of a rodent that howls like a wolf and hunts like a cougar . Be happy it 's but a fraction of the size of the mega-predators it emulates . Be very happy .
