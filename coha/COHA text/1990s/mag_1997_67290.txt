VARSITY TEAMS : 25 INTRAMURAL SPORTS : 22 FAMOUS ALUMNI : PAUL HORNUNG , JOE MONTANA , KNUTE ROCKNE EXTRA CREDIT FOR : INTRAMURAL BOXING AND TACKLE FOOTBALL // In 1995 the College Football Hall of Fame relocated from King 's Island , Ohio , to South Bend , Ind. , the home of Notre Dame . Were it not for the university 's Catholic affiliation , you might say this was a case of the mountain coming to Mohammed . // Since its inception in 1887 Notre Dame football has produced a ( feel free to say " an alltime leading " before each item ) .759 winning percentage , 77 consensus All-Americas , 11 national championships , seven Heisman Trophy winners and millions of ardent advocates and antagonists . Renown ? The Fighting Irish have given the sport its most famous coach ( Knute Rockne ) ; pep talk ( Rockne 's " Win one for the Gipper " speech ) ; fight song ( " Cheer , cheer for old Notre Dame ... " ) ; and even newspaper lead ( Grantland Rice 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . // In 1924 , shortly after Rockne 's charges had won their first national title , the Reverend John O'Hara , the school 's prefect of religion , wrote , " Notre Dame football is a new crusade : It kills prejudice and it stimulates faith . " Actually the legacy of Rockne is a campus on which religion , sports and academics are interwoven . The football team , which before each game attends mass en masse , even though a majority of the players these days are n't Catholics , has had a 98.5% graduation rate since 1962 . The school 's president , the Reverend Edward Malloy , played basketball for the Irish . // What 's the recipe for creating a campus crawling with jocks , a school once described in these pages as " even in the calmest of times ... resembling an Olympic training village " ? Build a national reputation through an intercollegiate sport ( see above ) so that more than 75% of the students you admit are high school letter winners . Require freshmen to live on campus in single-sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The act of cavorting with women in an ND dorm room , " says Kevin Coyne , who spent a year at Notre Dame and profiled it in his 1995 book , Domers , " is so fraught with dire consequences that , frankly , it 's safer to go outside and play tackle football . " // That 's what the male students do . Interhall football , which Rockne helped create in the late 1920s , bills itself as the only seasonlong , full-contact intramural football found outside the three service academies . The title game is played in 80,000-seat Notre Dame Stadium , which Rockne also designed and which offers a view of perhaps the most famous image in college sports : Touchdown Jesus ( so dubbed by students ) , the 132-foot-high mosaic of Christ on the wall of the Hesburgh Library . // Football aside , the devotion to sports here is as close to catholic as you will find anywhere . This year an estimated 90% of the 7,857 undergraduates will have participated in a club , intramural , recreational or varsity program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 84 ) , but the most unusual one is a boxing competition . Bengal Bouts , so named because the proceeds ( $12,000 to $20,000 annually from ticket sales , donations and fight-program ads ) are sent to missions in Bangladesh , draws as many as 125 fighters , who train for six weeks before entering the ring . // In many sports higher powers often seem to be at work on behalf of the Fighting Irish . " God does n't care whether Notre Dame wins or loses , " former football coach Lou Holtz was fond of saying , " but His mother does . " In 1974 the men 's basketball team ended UCLA 's NCAA-record winning streak at 88 games , prompting then coach Digger Phelps to coin the slogan " Nobody leaves Notre Dame Number 1 . " In 1994 the women 's soccer team performed an upset of similar magnitude by defeating North Carolina for the NCAA title . The Tar Heels had won the championship for nine straight years before falling 1-0 to the Irish . // Such high drama may be what inspires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alumni include esteemed sportswriter Red Smith , who briefly ran track in 1924 for a coach named Rockne ; former NBC Sports executive producer ( and current president , NBC West Coast ) Don Ohlmeyer and broadcasters Don Criqui , Hannah Storm and Mary Ann Grabavoy , who  --  now it can be told  --  was the real-life coed for whom would-be gridiron legend Rudy Ruettiger pined in his eponymous film . // Rudy , like all Notre Dame students except ROTC members , had to take a year of phys-ed classes to receive his degree . He also had to pass the school 's mandatory 100-yard swimming test . That 's right : Earning a degree from Notre Dame is literally a sink-or-swim proposition .
