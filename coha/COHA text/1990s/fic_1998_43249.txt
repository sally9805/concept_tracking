Bobby Bell 's fingers numbered four to a hand . His thumb and pointer were identical to God 's , but the other two were just fleshy stubs , stunted and fused on each slender . paw . He was a dumb kid , besides , if progress in school is a fair measure . He sized me up my first week in town , then came by my locker to demand a fight , the fall of 1967 . <p> We 'd moved to New Mexico from Illinois because my father was sick . How the change was supposed to help , I did n't know . When I asked , he removed his glasses as if the problem were with the black-rimmed lenses . His head tipped slightly on its thin scaffold of bone . I felt a corresponding tilt in my senses . " I 'm host to a disease ; " he said . A smile flickered across his lips . I began to tremble . <p> He continued . " You could say it 's a landlord and tenant affair . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He slipped the glasses on again , which made his eyes the wrong size for his face . " You 're worried . " His hand lighted like a butterfly upon my head . " All right . I 'm host , but there are no tenants , just uninvited guests , too small to see . " His lips crinkled , a modest grin . " Too small , " he assured me , " to even imagine . " His head tilted once more . " You wo n't worry , all right ? " I promised . <p> I had inherited my father 's slight build , which must have cheered Bobby Bell , to think he 'd found a frame , at last , more flimsy than his own . I colored easily as well , which provided him a hope even he knew to leave unsaid : blood that surged so close to the surface would wet his wrinkled shirt , spatter his shoes , and saturate the dirt where they paced . From the moment I met him , even before he required a fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who could beat him and those he could enslave . The division , extravagantly uneven , presented him his quest-to find someone over whom he could have dominion-all of this written upon his face , as the truth of my father 's condition was written upon mine . Which might have been why Bobby Bell thought he had an edge , as I was taller and only barely thinner . Why would he think my eyes were asking to be blackened but for a father frail as a child 's pledge ? <p> During that time , my mother came to my bed every night to take from me whatever book I was reading and point to the ticking clock above my head . She 'd sit on the mattress and tell me how well my father was doing , how this move could make all the difference . " Friends will come , " she said the night before the fray , meaning that I would make some eventually , that perspective was the larger test-we were here to save a life , to protect him from the guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , wanting to believe , and then , after I no longer could , willing to pretend . When she left , shutting the door and light , the room drifted away in a darkness that knew no end , which I would close my eyes against , and wait for the smaller dark of sleep . <p> Later that night I woke and stumbled into the hall-disoriented , still in Illinois . Light at the far end of the house drew me . My mother knelt by the easy chair to fit a pillow beneath my father 's sleeping head . He wore the top to his striped pajamas , the dark hair on his thin legs exaggerated like the carbon filaments I moved with a magnet to whisker a cartoon face . Mother 's gown rose up her legs as they straightened , covering her to the hips , the tan of her legs ending abruptly in the buttocks ' white exclamation . I retreated to the hall , watching her float a flowered bedsheet over him , then touch her lips to his temple , her solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How distant I lived from Bobby Bell . <p> The fight I remember with a clarity that defies time , as if I had more than lived it , as if it had not yet happened . We met at the bus stop , two stupid , savage children , enveloped by a crowd of onlookers I sensed more than saw . Bobby Bell pointed at my narrow chest . " Fairy , " he accused , a rage in his throat , an evil passion in his eyes . I had no decent reply , but spoke what first popped into my mouth . " Pixie , " I said , wanting to laugh , but the finger , that deformed hand thrown out at me , seemed a kind of reminder , like the mechanical voice in the underground that reminds you you 're on a train , like my father 's dry cough even on a morning following rain , the sky pristine with sunlight and the cleansing smell of creosote . <p> We wrestled on a patch of ground made bare by children 's shoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We lunged and grappled like things less than human . A friend of Bobby Bell 's invented a jeer . " You fucking Mr. Happy , " he yelled , his breath close and bitter , as if he might not be well . Did my mother choose my father for his weakness , as Bobby Bell had chosen me ? Is it cruel to suggest that she loved him most when he was his weakest ? What of the girl , a few years later , who claimed to be drawn to my silence ? Was she Bobby Bell in feminine guise , her white thighs holding me with such gentleness that I wept ? What of the women I later met , who picked me less as a man than as a mission , and who I treated like guests who 'd overstayed their welcome ? I do n't understand the first thing about love , especially that first thing , when passion inhabits your body before you 're aware , a passion you come to detect by the symptoms that remain . <p> As it turned out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quicker , too , throwing him to the dirt , shoving his nose against the hardened ground , the blood that colored his shirt his own . I can still hear his single cry , as I bent his arm beneath my knee . His skull , I tethered by his hair to my fist , and I might have gouged a hole with it , but his arm escaped . I had to make a dive . Shall I attempt to describe the feel of that inhuman hand in mine ? <p> " You 've made your point , " another boy said , as if it were a debate I 'd won . <p> I climbed off Bobby Bell and backed away , studying the crowd to see who might be pleased I 'd won and who might jump me if I turned . That act of accidental compassion-my world , like Bobby Bell 's , cleaved-caused in me a peculiar response . I could see Bobby Bell , his body in a twisted sprawl , but I could not see the others . As if my vision had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single frame . <p> " That do n't make no nevermind , " consoled his friend , touching the place on Bobby Bell where my knee had pinned his knobby spine . The others huddled-or hovered-about the fallen boy , but they were impossible to take in , the many guests , witnesses to that unfortunate accomplishment . <p> To be truthful , I 've never had trouble imagining the small . I pictured the microscopic company my father kept with a clarity that was almost scientific . And I could see how , in Bobby Bell 's eyes , each thing claimed only the value of its use to him : a tool , or not a tool . Viewed in this fashion , all of creation could be made minuscule . How unlike Bobby Bell was my father , who always saw the other side even in his own slipping away . " Such beauty , " he said to me , gripping the rail of the bed . " I might have missed it otherwise . " <p> We 're forty-three now , Bobby Bell and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls his . We have our own uneasy children . And still , I ca n't retreat far enough to see them all , those bodies assembled about the fallen one . How , precisely , do they gather ? How , exactly , do they stand ? I think it matters . Are they stooped or standing erect ? Has one covered her ears , another closed his eyes ? Does that head swivel to miss the farce ? Or is she laughing , giant that she has become , at the grappling of such silly and malignant boys ? I carry them all with me-a fist that rises in what might be fear , shoulders that turn in what might be submission , hands that rest on what might be knees . He told me what threatened him was too small to imagine , as if , given this , I could be spared the rest , but it was n't the microbes that troubled me after his death . He had it wrong , my father and his tiny beings . The guests that stubbornly remain haunt us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
