Gloriously expressive teenyboperas like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dawson 's Creek signal a new wave of pulp lyricism . It 's enough to renew a man 's faith in TV // TO ARTY FOLK , the most influential TV show of the early nineties was Twin Peaks . Credit David Lynch 's groundbreaker for broody current fare like The X-Files and Millennium and a near decade 's worth of enigmatic commercials . But my nod goes to Beverly Hills , 90210 , the show that reinvented crud designed to tantalize thirteen-year-old girls . Lucky them , I say . Most current primetime dramas for adults are mired in formula-cop shows , doctor shows , and lawyer shows whose upscale versions come adorned with self-serious , Emmywinning tics that amount to pouring bearnaise on a wiener . ( Does anyone know what Homicide is so damn pessimistic about ? John Waters thinks Baltimore 's just wonderful . ) Even sitcoms promote psychobabble 's gooey bromides-here comes Home Improvement 's Tim Allen , ready to teach me how to be a better person between pratfalls while I pine for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventiveness , pulp lyricism , and sass , these days teenybop TV is where to look . What everyone not put on notice by l Itanic 's megabucks learned when the WB 's ultrasensitive coming-of-age drama Felicity became this fall 's most heavily hyped new series is that entertainment aimed at teenage girls-and their brothers , who seem less hung up than boys used to be by the whole **27;829;TOOLONG thing-is where the demographic action is , a fact most quality-TV types greet with sighs . Yet even by their standards , no adult half hour is as tenderly made as UPN 's Moesha , which also so outclasses the average " black sitcom " that nobody , least of all its integrated pubie audience , ever calls it one . That nifty workplace nightmare La Femme Nikita aside , no fantasy geared to grown-ups is as fast on its feet , or as rich in the **31;858;TOOLONG zingers that make fantasy hit home , as Buff fy the Vampire Slayer . With the Taster 's Choice couple dead of caffeine poisoning , no adult TV romance matches the charm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soap opera in television history . Meanwhile , here we mature audiences sit , stuck with the hystericsby-the-yard of Steven Bochco 's latest ode to the white man 's burden . Should adults feel cheated ? Nah . As far as I 'm concerned , the pubie audience deserves some treats . C'm on , this society messes over adolescent females in all sorts of ways , from denying them equal time in classrooms to inculcating body images that lead the average thirteen-year-old to fret that Barbies are way too plump . Television used to serve them just as badly : Being put in touch with your sexuality by the chipmunky likes of Bobby Sherman always struck me as needlessly cruel . Call me a traitor to my demographic , but I think it 's great that these days girls are getting fresher , livelier , flat-out better TV shows than their parents or older siblings . And they owe it all to Aaron Spelling , the most famously expedient producer in the biz , who at a low point in his career-the glittering days of Charlie 's Angels and The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell then-lowrent Fox on a teen sudser that he probably never guessed was innovative . 90210 invented a new realm : Planet Teen . Up until then , shows featuring juveniles had always been family-centered shows , preserving adult hegemony at some cost to adolescent realities . But for Spelling 's dwarf James Deans and mini Marilyns , the relationships that counted were with one another , and parents and school took a backseat to the crucial business of soul-searching and self-dramatization . By swapping a middle-class milieu that most adolescent viewers knew too well to find entrancing for a gilded locale they 'd have loved to call home , the show also indulged their fantasies-of aristocracy as much as affluence , I imagine , although the affluence did n't hurt-while pretending its concern was with their problems . That 's a recipe for TV success you can take right to the bank , which by a stroke of good fortune was where Spelling was headed anyway . Aside from the fact that no one over fifteen cared much , the main reason 9021 O 's departures were n't noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But finding original ways of being corny is what innovative TV usually does , and that was true of Twin Peaks , too , in spite of any amount of blather about David Lynch 's ( nonexistent , so far as I could tell ) tongue-in-chic irony . Pseudoinnovative television , by contrast , usually consists of corny ways of being original . On this turf , Spelling 's crassness was a plus . While critics deplored 90210 as gaudy piffle-which , of course , it was , and that was no failing-the most acclaimed ( by grown-ups ) teen show of the nineties was My So-Called Life , from Thirtysomething creators Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick , the Merchant Ivory of yup TV . Yet their tactful , intelligent empathy appealed less to the pubies who were supposed to identify than it did to their parents , because adolescent taste is never middlebrow-it 's either studiedly lofty or assertively dumb . Zwick and Herskovitz seemed to think that adolescents wanted to see the truth told about their circumstances , which they never do ; that 's the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crave is depictions of their feelings , which are at once too silly and too lavish for verisimilitude to accommodate . The proof My So-Called Life was classy was that it was n't any fun-a value that this culture , officially at least , holds in low esteem , taking care to label it trivial even when the audience gets permission to wallow in pop shallowness . The vestigial puritanism implied in that fave catchall for the fecklessly enjoyable- " guilty pleasures " - strikes me as berserk . I may find Frasier more gratifying than The Nanny , but that does n't make it ( or Chicago Hope or Masterpiece Theatre ) more virtuous . Given how sanctimonious people 's definitions of " good " TV have become , it 's no wonder that imaginative producers like Dawson 's Creek creator Kevin Williamson-the youth-cult ace behind the Scream movies-and Buff fy 's presiding genius , Joss Whedon , feel more at home in the teenybop ghetto , creating for an audience to whom the sublime and the ridiculous are n't opposites . This lets Williamson the pop prankster indulge his ardent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gainsay his swoony hyperbole , and gives Whedon the pop humanist elbowroom to turn a wonderful joke-high school as a literal horror movie-into an amazing fight-the-power fable that has teenage boys as well as girls cheering on Sarah Michelle Gellar 's pint-sized Joan of Arc , who 's not only a feminist icon but ( unless Xena : Warrior Princess counts ) TV 's first feminist pinup . Can it get better than that ? Believe me , it could stand to-plenty of the programs pubies flip for are still dreck by any criterion . Predictably , though , the most dismal offerings are those that work the familyvalues homilies the hardest . Moesha is an exception , since its delicate touch , plus new-jane diva Brandy 's winsomeness , keeps the straight and narrow looking like the honestly fulfilling road it can be . Not so the appalling 7th Heaven , which features Stephen Collins as a minister raising his kids right . It 's The Brady Bunch without one-liners , with God filling in for Ann B. Davis as the housekeeper . ( One friend insists the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrathful divine retribution for its cutesy-poo wholesomeness and not-so-covert propaganda for traditional sex roles , it 's also the worst-photographed series in prime time . Nor am I a fan of Party of Five , which uses the neat premise of wiping out Mom and Dad in a car crashtalk about a Planet Teen fantasy ; Pippi Longstocking never had it so good-to drill young viewers in responsibility by letting their onscreen stand-ins take turns pretending to be one another 's parents . The irresponsible shows win my vote . Before it debuted a year ago , Dawson 's Creek got denounced ( and hyped-the WB is n't stupid ) for its alleged raunch , and even nonbluenoses blanched when one first-season plotline had Pacey ( Joshua Jackson ) playing underage hidethe-salami with his English teacher , with no permanent damage on either side . Yet this is probably the least cynical , most sweetly celebratory series about teenage innocence ever made-and it does right by values , too , mainly because its teenophile producer understands that , however little they like being lectured , teens themselves are inveterate moralizers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( James Van Der Beek ) is even something of a prig , a trait the show respects while recognizing that it 's partly a panic reaction-a way for him to valorize his confusion . If Williamson 's series-set in a bucolic , fairy-tale Massachusetts beach town undisfigured by tourists or winter-is self-consciously idyllic about beautiful youth , Whedon literalizes teendom 's dark side . Forget your preconceptions ( not to mention ER ) . For my money , Buffy 's the best show on the air-brainy , goodhearted , gloriously expressive TV poetry that 's " so much to my taste , " to quote Robert Christgau on the New York Dolls , " I have to mistrust my taste a little . " Not a lot , though . Unlike the gloomy-gussied X-Files , whose cannily provocative surface conceals escapist fluff , Buffy 's richer , more ingenious fantasy smacks fans where they live via haunting , funny metaphors for loneliness , oddity , and good old hormone fever . This spring , when Buffy 's mother , after spending two seasons in the dark about her daughter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before her very eyes , was there a pubie in America who did n't thrill to the subtext ? What a way for Mom to learn her little girl was growing up . When it comes to championing girl power-and you bet Whedon means toBuffy is n't the only role model stalking the tube . Even Dawson 's Creek flips the script by making Van Der Beek the clueless love object and Katie Holmes the smart , resilient audience stand-in , and one good reason to applaud the trend is that it 's so at odds with the antiwoman bias that now rules the rest of prime time . Sometimes in disguise , for sure , but even so , my ideal Buffy episode would end with her plunging a stake through Ally McBeal 's heart . Liberation is the undercurrent that gives teenybop TV its kick , and it crops up in unlikely places . ABC 's Sabrina , the Teenage Witch is a cheerfully insipid kiddie yukfest-based on an Archie comic , yet-that 's about just what the title says ; Sabrina ( Melissa Joan Hart ) has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the family car or maybe her sexuality . Yet that still puts her one up on her predecessors in those definitive prefeminist parables I Dream of Jeannie and Bewitched , two shows whose generic plot , week in and week out , involved the frantic men in Jeannie 's and Samantha 's lives trying to stop them from using their powers . ( Gee , what was that about ? Damned if I know , son ; ask that nice Mrs. Friedan down the street . ) Which does n't mean a revolution 's underfoot ; this is kiddie programming , after all . But mischief ? That 's another story . Consider , for instance , Sabrina 's less-thannuclear household : two charming aunts who date men but do n't fool me for a second , plus a talking feline as arch as the late , great Paul Lynde . ( I still remember one editor 's spluttering reaction the first time I noted this in print : " You think Salem is gay ? " Well , no . He 's just one cool cat . ) There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for thirty years , and whenever witches and such turn up on TV , I smell metaphors a-brewing . In the premiere of the WB 's fall entry Charmed , three sisters reunited by their grandmother 's death got the good news first : She 'd passed on supernatural gifts to them . ( Weird sisterhood is powerful . ) Then came the bad news : Warlocks were out to kill them . At least Darin and Major Nelson never thought of that . <p>
