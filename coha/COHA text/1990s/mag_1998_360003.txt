California Republican Senate challenger MATT FONG ( 1 ) alienated two different groups of potential supporters , first by giving money to a religious anti-gay group and then by signing a pledge for the gay Log Cabin Republicans . Such waffling . Who does he think he is , the President ? <P> In Michigan , the biggest headache for lawyer and Democratic gubernatorial candidate GEOFFREY FIEGER ( 2 ) was n't his defense of Jack ( " Dr. Death " ) Kevorkian . Instead he found himself under fire for calling Jesus a goofball and comparing Jewish leaders to the Nazis . Fieger 's last ads had voters saying they did n't like him but would grudgingly vote for him . Few did . <P> It 's one thing for a candidate to walk across a state to meet voters . Pro-environment Democratic Senate candidate DAVID OSTERBERG ( 3 ) decided to canoe across a state  --  in this case , Iowa . Most voters are mainstream , Dave , not midstream . <P> FAY BOOZMAN , an eye surgeon and Republican contender for the Senate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims from getting pregnant . Guess someone slept through a semester in med school . <P> In California , Republican BOB DORNAN ( 4 ) ran against Representative Loretta Sanchez , claiming his antiabortion views made him the " only Latino in the race " and calling himself " Mr. Immigrant Man . " Might have worked better if he had n't wrongly blamed his 1996 loss on voter fraud by illegal aliens . <P> New York Senator AL D'AMATO ( 5 ) called his Jewish opponent , Representative Chuck Schumer , a " putzhead " in front of a group of Jews . It 's unsure whether they took it in its Yiddish context ( penis head ) or as a modern slur ( jerk ) , but one thing is clear : Senator Pothole 's campaign collapsed into a big one . <P>  --  By Tamala M.
