<p> The most influential economist of all time was not Adam Smith , John Maynard Keynes or Milton Friedman , but Thomas Malthus . <p> Since Malthus published his " Essay on the Principle of Population " in 1798 , his thesis that population growth will inevitably outstrip the world 's resources has become an item of faith for most people . <p> Few modern economists buy this dismal proposition . For developed countries , disposing of food surpluses is a perennial problem , not starvation . And developing countries often complain that prices of the raw materials they export are forever falling . But all this has n't stopped population biologists , environmentalists , foreign aid officials and United Nations bureaucrats from sounding the alarm on overpopulation in the Third World and overconsumption in the First World . <p> In a recent UN publication timed for the start of the Cairo conference on population and development earlier this month , Elizabeth Dowdeswell , executive director of the UN Environment Program , declared that " the North must reduce its abusive consumption patterns and the South ( must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without solutions to both , humankind will be guilty of its own undoing . " <p> It 's unclear whether the problem is too much wealth or too little . On one hand , population growth is blamed for keeping much of the world in misery . On the other , Dowdeswell complained that because of rising incomes and " burgeoning economies " around the world , " unsustainable consumption patterns are slowly becoming a global phenomenon . " <p> Whether modern affluence is really so " unsustainable " is debatable . Rich economies do consume more , but they also produce more . They do a better job than most poorer economies of cleaning their air and water . And as some resources become scarce , they switch to alternatives or recycling . Consider the replacement of relatively expensive copper with glass fibers , based on ubiquitous silicon , to carry modern communications . <p> Dowdeswell 's observation that many economies are " burgeoning " is more on the mark . In a new essay due to be published shortly by the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in only four or five countries today eat less well than the citizens of France in the 1780s , and they owe their current woes to war and revolution , not overpopulation . <p> In 1986 , a National Academy of Sciences study group reported that Western industrial nations enjoyed rapid income growth from the 18th to 20th centuries despite rapid population growth , that most developing countries entered a similar trajectory after 1950 and that statistical comparisons between countries show little or no link between between population growth and economic growth . <p> From 1950 to 1980 , per capita gross domestic product in the developing world grew 2.6 percent annually while population was growing at a 2 percent rate . In contrast , before 1950 , population grew less than 1 percent a year and incomes barely budged . <p> Johnson concedes that extremely high population growth rates , above 3 percent annually , " may reduce rates of per capita income growth primarily due to the stress placed on institutions such as education , health and city public services . " <p> But government mismanagement , civil war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of misery , he concludes . <p> University of Maryland economist Julian Simon , the ultimate contrarian , argues that the world is only as rich as it is today because of fast population growth . Without billions of people , the globe would not have sufficient brainpower and entrepreneurship to create the technological revolution that makes affluence possible . <p> But not even Simon would claim that the earth can sustain any level of population or that its inhabitants would necessarily enjoy a vastly more crowded world . <p> Fortunately , a broad middle ground now exists among experts . By giving women more contraceptive choices and more access to education , jobs and property , most families will limit their size even as they enjoy greater prosperity . This was the message of the Cairo conference . <p> . <p> HMOS TO THE RESCUE ? <p> Hammered by high workers ' compensation costs , California is experimenting with the use of health maintenance organizations and other managed care programs to treat injured workers . <p> Major California HMOs are gearing up to create allied " health care organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than under the fee-for-service system typical of workers ' comp today . In a pilot project in San Diego , government workers who are insured by Kaiser Permanente , the state 's largest HMO , also will go to Kaiser for on-the-job injuries normally treated by outside doctors under workers ' compensation . <p> Oregon and Florida already have pioneered such approaches . The idea of folding workers ' compensation into broader medical coverage also has been floated at the national level , most notably by the Clinton administration . The theory is to cut administration and fraud by putting medical care in the hands of institutions with an incentive to control costs . <p> A new study by the Florida Department of Insurance , showed savings of nearly 60 percent for one group of employees and 34 percent for another group sent to health maintenance or preferred provider organizations . Participants in the managed care programs were generally satisfied with the quality of care . <p> Another new study , by Thomas Parry at the California Workers Compensation Institute , which represents insurers , also supports the managed care option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated under workers ' comp , and people who sustained similar injuries off the job and were treated under a group medical plan . <p> He found that total treatment costs under workers ' comp averaged 21 percent more , mainly because workers ' comp doctors ran up the tab with more treatments and procedures . <p> Parry did find , however , that the total treatment time  --  from first doctor 's visit to last  --  was 78 percent longer for the patients treated under group medical plans than for the workers ' comp group . <p> It could be that workers ' comp doctors attack the problem with more intensive , though costly treatment , returning workers to the job as fast as possible . Parry 's next job is to investigate whether extra treatment time for group medical patients translates into more time out of work by the employee , which could offset treatment savings . <p> . <p> IN SEARCH OF EDUCATION <p> Even the most devout defender of public education has to despair : No matter how much society spends on its schools , students do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influential article published in 1986 , University of Rochester economist Eric Hanushek noted the paradox that real spending per pupil in the public schools had soared 135 percent from 1960 to 1983 without any apparent improvement in educational quality . If anything , more money seemed to make things worse . <p> No one has a perfect explanation , but some clues are provided in a recent study by Teresa Morisi , an economist at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics . She charts changes in student enrollment against employment of teachers and all educational workers . She finds , lo and behold , flat enrollment , a modest increase in teachers and soaring growth in other employees . <p> Programs for remedial and bilingual education and services for disabled students , with all the associated staff needed to administer them , have exploded since the federal government began pumping money into K-12 education in the Lyndon Johnson years , Morisi notes . These are all important but have little or no effect on most students . Administrators , custodians and " special ed " teachers who rarely step foot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money , leaving little extra for general education . <p> Whether more money would do any good remains an open question . But unless the money is put into the classroom , it will pump up the bureaucracy but not educational scores .
