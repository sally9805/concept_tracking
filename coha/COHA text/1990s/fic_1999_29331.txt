Dismas Hardy was enjoying a superb round of darts , closing in on what might become a personal best . He was in his office on a Monday morning , throwing his twenty-gram hand-tooled , custom-flighted tungsten beauties . He called the game " twenty-down " although it was n't any kind of sanctioned affair . It had begun as simple practice -- once around and down the board from " 20 " to bull's-eye . He 'd turned the practice rounds into a game against himself . His record was twenty-five throws . The best possible round was twenty-one , and now he was shooting at the " 3 " with his nineteenth dart . A twenty-two was still possible . Beating twenty-five was going to be a lock , assuming his concentration did n't get interrupted . On his desk the telephone buzzed . He 'd worked downtown at an office on Sutter Street for nearly six years . The rest of the building was home to David Freeman &; Associates , a law firm specializing in plaintiffs ' personal injury and criminal defense work . But Hardy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't work for Freeman at all , although lately almost all of his billable hours had come from a client his landlord had farmed out to him . Hardy occupied the only office on the top floor of the building . Both literally and figuratively he was on his own . He held on to his dart and threw an evil eye at the telephone behind him , which buzzed again . To throw now would be to miss . He sat back on the desk , punched a button . " Yo . " Freeman 's receptionist , Phyllis , had grown to tolerate , perhaps even like , Hardy , although it was plain that she disapproved of his casual attitude . This was a law firm . Lawyers should answer their phone crisply , with authority and dignity . They should n't just pick up and say " Yo . " He took an instant 's pleasure in her sigh . She lowered her voice . " There 's a man down here to see you . He does n't have an appointment . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest had stepped in something on the sidewalk . " He says he knows you from "  - -  a pause while she sought a suitable euphemism . She finally failed and had to come out with the hated truth --  " your bar . His name is Graham Russo . " Hardy knew half a dozen Russos -- it was a common name in San Francisco -- but hearing that Graham from the Little Shamrock was downstairs , presumably in need of a lawyer 's services , narrowed it down . Hardy glanced at his wall calendar . It was Monday , May 12 . Sighing , he put his precious dart down on his desk and told Phyllis to send Mr. Russo right on up . Hardy was standing at his door as Graham trudged up the stairs , a handsome , athletic young guy with the weight of this world on his shoulders . And at least one other world , Hardy knew , that had crashed and burned all around him . They had met when Graham showed up for a beer at the Shamrock . Over the course of the night Hardy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Graham , too , was an attorney , although he was n't practicing right at the moment . The community had blackballed him . Hardy had had his own run-ins with the legal bureaucracy and knew how devastating the ostracism could be . Hell , even when you were solidly within it , the law life itself was so unrelentingly adversarial that the whole world sometimes took on a hostile aspect . So the two men had hit it off . Both men were estranged from the law in their own ways . Graham had stayed after last call , helped clean up . He was a sweet kid -- maybe a little naive and idealistic , but his head seemed to be on straight . Hardy liked him . * * * Before the law Graham 's world had been baseball . An All-American center fielder at USF during the late eighties , he 'd batted .373 and had been drafted in the sixth round by the Dodgers . He then played two years in the minor leagues , making it to Double-A San Antonio before he 'd fouled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitalized him for three weeks , and when he got out , his vision did n't come with him . And so with a lifetime pro average of .327 , well on the way to the bigs , he 'd had to give it all up . Rootless and disheartened , he had enrolled in law school at Boalt Hall in Berkeley . Graduating at the top of his class , he beat out intense competition and got hired for a one-year term as a clerk with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals . But he only stayed six months . In early 1994 -- the year of the baseball strike -- about two months after he passed the bar , he quit . He wanted , after all , to play baseball . So he went to Vero Beach , Florida , to try out as a replacement player for the Dodgers . And he made the team . At the Shamrock he 'd made it clear to Hardy that he 'd never have played as a scab . All along , all he 'd wanted out of the deal was for the Dodgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared from his vision ; he was still in great shape . He thought he could shine in spring training , get cut as a replacement when they all did , but at least have a shot at the minors again . And that 's what happened . He started the ' 94 season with the Albuquerque Dukes , Triple A , farther along the path to the major leagues than he 'd been seven years earlier . But he could n't find the damn curveball and the new shot at his baseball career , upon which he 'd risked everything , lasted only six weeks . His average was .192 when he got cut outright . He had n't had a hit in his last seven games . Hell , he told Hardy , he would have cut himself . Graham had a lumberjack 's shoulders and the long legs of a high hurdler . Under a wave of golden hair his square-jawed face was clean shaven . Today he wore a gray-blue sport coat over a royal-blue dress shirt , stonewashed jeans , cowboy boots . He was leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hardy 's desk , elbows on his knees . Hardy noticed the hands clasped in front of him -- the kind of hands that , when he got older , people would call gnarled -- workingman 's hands , huge and somehow expressive . Graham essayed a smile . " I do n't even know why I 'm here , tell you the truth . " Hardy 's face creased . " I often feel the same way myself . " He was sitting on the corner of his desk . " Your dad ? " Graham nodded . Salvatore Russo -- Herb Caen 's column had dubbed him Salmon Sal and the name had stuck -- was recent news . Despondent over poor health , his aging body , and financial ruin , Sal had apparently killed himself last Friday by having a few cocktails , then injecting himself with morphine . He 'd left a Do Not Resuscitate form for the paramedics , but he was already dead when they 'd arrived . To the public at large Sal was mostly unknown . But he was well known in San Francisco 's legal community . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law workshops in an old Ford pickup . Behind the Hall of Justice , where Hardy would see him , he 'd park by the hydrant and sell salmon , abalone , sturgeon , caviar , and any other produce of the sea he happened to get his hands on . His customers included cops , federal- , municipal- , and superior-court judges , attorneys , federal marshals , sheriffs , and the staffs at both halls -- Justice and City -- and at the federal courthouse . The truck appeared only one day a week , but since Sal 's seafood was always fresher and a lot cheaper than at the markets , he apparently made enough to survive , notwithstanding the fact that he did it all illegally . His salmon had their tails clipped , which meant they had been caught for sport and could n't be sold . Abalone was the same story ; private parties taking abalone for commercial sale had been outlawed for years . His winter-run chinooks had probably been harvested by Native Americans using gill nets . And yet year after year this stuff would appear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it did n't matter because he was connected . His childhood pals knew him from the days when Fisherman 's Wharf was a place where men went down to the sea in boats . Now these boys were judges and police lieutenants and heads of departments . They were not going to bust him . Sal might live on the edge of the law , but the establishment considered him one of the good guys -- a character in his yellow scarves and hip boots , the unlit stogie chomped down to its last inch , the gallon bottles from which he dispensed red and white plonk in Dixie cups along with a steady stream of the most politically incorrect jokes to be found in San Francisco . The day Hardy had met Sal , over a decade ago , he 'd been with Abe Glitsky . Glitsky was half black and half Jewish and every inch of him scary looking -- a hatchet face and a glowing scar through his lips , top to bottom . Sal had seen him , raised his voice . " Hey , Abe , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this building and they both fall off at the same time . Which one hits the ground first ? " " I do n't know , Sal , " Glitsky answered , " which one ? " " Who cares ? " Now Sal was dead and the newspapers had been rife with conjecture : early evidence indicated that someone had been in the room with him when he 'd died . A chair knocked over in the kitchen . Angry sounds . Other evidence of struggle . The police were calling the death suspicious . Maybe someone had helped Sal die -- put him on an early flight . " I did n't know Sal was your father , " Hardy said . " Not until just now . " " Yeah , well . I did n't exactly brag about him . " Graham took a breath and looked beyond Hardy , out the window . " The funeral 's tomorrow . " When no more words came , Hardy prompted him . " Are you in trouble ? " " No ! " A little too quickly , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't think so . I do n't know why I would be . " Hardy waited some more . " I mean , there 's a lot happening all at once . The estate -- although the word estate is a joke . Dad asked me to be his executor although we never got around to drawing up the will , so where does that leave it ? Your guess is as good as mine . " " You were n't close , you and your dad ? " Graham took a beat before he answered . " Not very . " Hardy thought the eye contact was a little overdone , but he let it go . He 'd see where this all was leading . " So you need help with the estate ? What kind of help ? " " That 's just it . I do n't know what I need . I need help in general . " Graham hung his head and shook it , then looked back up . " The cops have been around , asking questions . " " What kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did I know about my dad 's condition ? Like that . It was obvious where they were going . " Graham 's blue eyes flashed briefly in anger , maybe frustration . " How can they think I know anything about this ? My dad killed himself for a lot of good reasons . The guy 's disoriented , losing his mind . He 's in awesome pain . I 'd 've done the same thing . " " And what do the police think ? " " I do n't know what they can be thinking . " Another pause . " I had n't seen him in a week . First I heard of it was Saturday night . Some homicide cop is at my place when I get home . " " Where 'd you get home from ? " " Ball game . " He raised his eyes again , spit out the next word . " Softball . We had a tournament in Santa Clara , got eliminated in the fourth game , so I got home early , around six . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Rodin hands . " I did n't kill my dad . " " I did n't ask that . I asked about Friday night . " He let out a breath , calming down . " After work , home . " " Alone ? " He smiled . " Just like the movie . Home alone . I love that answer . The cop liked it , too , but for different reasons . I could tell . " Hardy nodded . " Cops can be tough to please . " " I worked till nine-thirty . . . . " " What do you do , besides baseball ? " Graham corrected him . " Softball . " A shrug . " I 've been working as a paramedic since . . . well , lately . " " Okay . So you were riding in an ambulance Friday night ? " A nod . " I got home around ten-fifteen . I knew I had some games the next day -- five , if we went all the way . Wanted to get some rest . Went to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work ? " " Around three , three-thirty . I punched in . They 'll have a record of it . " " And what time did they find your dad ? " " Around ten at night . " Graham did n't seem to have a problem with the timing , although to Hardy it invited some questions . If his memory served him , and it always did , Sal had apparently died between one and four o'clock in the afternoon . This was the issue Graham was skirting , which perhaps the police were considering if they were thinking about Graham after all . He would have had plenty of time between one o'clock and when he checked in to work near three . But the young man was going on . " Judge Giotti , you know . Judge Giotti found him . " " I read . What was he doing there ? " Graham shrugged . " I just know what everybody knows -- he 'd finished having dinner downtown . He had a fish order in and Sal did n't show , so he thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And why would the judge do that ? " The answer was unforced , Graham recounting old family history . " They were friends . Used to be , anyway , in high school , then college . They played ball together . " " Your father went to college ? " Graham nodded . " It 's weird , is n't it ? Salmon Sal the college grad . Classic underachiever , that was Sal . Runs in the family . " He forced a smile , making a joke , but kept his hands clamped tightly together , leaning forward casually , elbows resting on his knees . His knuckles were white . " So . Giotti ? " Hardy asked . Graham cast his eyes to the floor . " You were n't his clerk , were you ? " The head came back up . Graham said no . He 'd clerked for Harold Draper , another federal judge with the Ninth Circuit . " I guess what I 'm asking , " Hardy continued , " is whether you and Giotti -- him being your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while you were clerking . " Graham took a moment , then shook his head . " No . Giotti came by once after I got hired to say congratulations . But these judges do n't have a life . I did n't even see him in the halls . " " And how long did you work there ? " " Six months . " Hardy slid from the desk and crossed to his window . " Let me be sure I 've got it right , " he said . " Draper hired you to become a clerk for the Ninth ? How many clerks does he have ? " " Three . " " For a year each ? " " Right . That 's the term . " Hardy thought so . He went on . " When I was getting into practice right after the Civil War , a federal clerkship was considered the plum job of all time right out of law school . Is that still the case ? " This brought a small smile . " Everybody seems to think so . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try out as a replacement player during the baseball strike ? " Graham sat back finally , unclenched his hands , spread them out . " Arrogant , ungrateful wretch that I am . " " So now everybody in the legal community thinks you 're either disloyal or brain dead . " " No , those are my friends . " Graham took a beat . " Draper , for example , hates my guts . So do his wife , kids , dogs , the other two clerks , the secretaries -- they all really really hate me personally . Everybody else just wishes I 'd die soon , as slowly and painfully as possible . Both . " Hardy nodded . " So Giotti did n't call you when he found your dad ? " Graham shook his h
