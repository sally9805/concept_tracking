WEDNESDAY 11TH AUGUST 1999 . It is not Judgment Day . As the train pulls into Penzance , Mary Beth yawns and stretches . She has n't slept well in the hard narrow seat . Her clothes  --  UCLA sweatshirt over T-shirt , jeans  --  are gritty and grimy from dried perspiration and two days ' wear . She reaches up for her backpack . Dizziness as she stands : breakfast and coffee will cure it . She undoes the rubber band holding her hair back , shakes her hair out , then ties it again in a ponytail . She strides down the platform , her ticket ready for inspection . It 's still cool at this time , 8:30 . Salt is in the air ; seagulls squall . She visits the rest room to wash under her arms , clean her teeth , freshen up . <p> Tonight she 'll sleep better : she 's booked ahead at the Youth Hostel here in Penzance . It 'll be hot today , few if any clouds . She wo n't be disappointed . No clouds will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain 's notoriously unpredictable weather wo n't spoil everything . <p> She goes into the small station buffet and on impulse buys a newspaper . She 's made a point of disregarding the news during her two months in Europe , especially what 's been happening back home  --  strife and race riots . Too depressing  --  she 'll bone up on all that when she returns to california in September . She sits down at the comer of a table with a Brunch Muffin and a plastic cup of coffee almost too hot to touch . Traveling on a budget : it appeals to her ascetic side , and keeps her slim . <p> Mary Beth left Amy , the college friend she was traveling with , behind in London . Amy had n't wanted to come with her to Cornwall : London was much more interesting to her . " I can see it on TV , " she said . " You 'll get a better view that way . " <p> " It 's not the same ; " said Mary Beth . <p> So Amy went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overnight train . They kissed , embraced , promised to meet up again at the end of the week . Mary Beth waved at Amy as the train pulled out ; just as Amy slipped out of sight , Mary Beth saw her turn and walk away down the platform . It 's all or nothing now , she thought . This was why she 'd insisted on being in England in August , rather than anywhere else in Europe . Mary Beth 's obsession , as the much more sanguine Amy put it . <p> In the newsstand , the local paper has a large headline : ECLIPSE DAY ! <p> As she sits at the table  --  alone now except for a late-thirties man with thinning hair sitting opposite  --  an elderly man strides past and slaps something onto the table . Both Mary Beth and the other man look at it simultaneously , catch each other 's gaze ; smile . <p> The elderly man has left a crudely printed flier on the table : REPENT FOR JUDGMENT DAY IS AT HAND , it says . <p> Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Penzance ; men and women are traveling to work . Children are out of school for the summer . She is just one amongst many to pass through this station . There is nothing unusual about today . Except for one thing , there will be nothing unusual . It is not Judgment Day . <p> Clive sips his coffee and idly watches the young American woman . A student , obviously : he got her nationality from her accent when she spoke to the woman behind the counter . She must be about twenty , he guesses ; five foot ten tall , tanned , honey-blonde hair tied back with a robber band . <p> Their eyes meet . " Hi , " she says . <p> " Hello . You were on the train , were n't you ? " <p> She nods . " It was so uncomfortable . Jeez . " <p> " Was n't it just . And I had a sleeper . So much for British Rail . " <p> " So you come from London ? " <p> " Well , the Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " L.A. I 'm on vacation . In Europe for three months . " <p> There 's a pause , then Clive says : " You 're here for the eclipse ? " <p> She nods , her mouth full of Branch Muffin . <p> " Me too . I 'm going to take the bus to St. Just . You 'll get a better view of it from there . The path of totality goes through it . It 's a church town , twenty-five minutes away . " <p> " Sounds like a neat place . " <p> " It 's quite pretty , I 'm told . It 's been developed a bit in the past few years , though . " <p> And so they tacitly agree to travel together . Clive guesses she senses he 's no threat to her . She 's intelligent , and her intuition is sharp . He radiates no sexual interest in her . <p> He said good-bye to his lover Mark at Paddington . They 'd spent the evening watching Nashville , as ever one of Clive 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The print was faded and scratched , and jumped in places , but the film is an old friend ; Clive 's memory filled in the blank spots , resonated with familiar scenes , settled into the characters ' interlocking stories as if into a comfortable , well-worn chair . It had been several years since he 'd seen it , but it 's a film that he 's marked stages in his personal development by , in the way it changes at each viewing . His only regret is that he was n't old enough to see it on its first release , in a virgin print . <p> They kissed good-bye on Paddington platform . Mark would be visiting a dying friend in the North , while Clive made his pilgrimage to Cornwall . <p> Clive 's parents woke him one night in July 1969 , just short of his fifth birthday , to watch live coverage of Nell Armstrong making one small step for a man . To his chagrin he does n't remember that , although he remembers watching later Apollos on TV . And all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Space Shuttle . This total eclipse will be the only one visible in Britain during his lifetime , and he 's made a pact with his younger self to witness it . He 's taken time off work to do just that . <p> He and the American leave the station buffet , walk outside into the car park . It 's a quarter to nine , and the sky is brightening . He points out to her St. Michael 's Mount , still wreathed in morning mist . he is the host , she the guest in his country ; he feels obliged to show her the more famous sights . The sun is still full : first contact , when the Moon 's disc clips the Sun 's , is an hour and three quarters away . Perhaps he 'll show her around Penzance first before they take the St. Just bus in time for second contact , when the eclipse becomes total , at 11:10 . <p> " I 'm Clive , by the way . " He extends his hand . <p> She takes it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom the director , and the red light on top of the camera tums on . <p> Diana imperceptibly breathes in and says : " Thanks , Michael . It 's ten o'clock here in Penzance . The eclipse is n't due to start until 10:30 , but already crowds have gathered for this rare astronomical event . " She steps to one side and turns her head . The camera follows her gaze and looks over the railings to the narrow beach  --  if beach is n't too grandiose a word : Nearly five hundred people are standing on the pebbles , looking up at the sun , holding up squares of smoked glass to test them , or projecting through telescopes onto white card . The tide laps about the ankles of the furthest out , but they 're oblivious to it . Some are sitting on the sand , others in swimsuits squatting in the water . At the far end , a small group of women are sunbathing topless . <p> " This is Diana Mathis , BBC News in Penzance . " <p> The red light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 've got a fucking ladder ! " She bends forward , picks at her tights with her fingers . <p> " It did n't show , " says Tom . <p> Diana looks up . " Good . " She straightens . " I have n't got a spare pair on me . There 's no way we 've got time to buy one . " She glances down ruefully at the ladder , tugs half-heartedly at the hem of her skirt in an effort to cover it . " Oh fuck it . " <p> " You were good , Di , " says Tom . <p> " I should fucking well hope so , " says Diana . " I 've done it long enough . " She glances up at Tom ; their eyes meet briefly . A flicker of a smile . Professional to a fault while at work ; she prides herself on that . Even though every member of the crew knows she and Tom are lovers . <p> Diana straightens , lights a cigarette . She never smokes on screen ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filmed unawares doing it . But there 's a few minutes that can be snatched before they have to film again , when she has to readopt her public face . Fortunately no one stares at them , or tries to get in the way of the camera . And no one questions the presence of a black woman amongst three older white men . <p> TV crews will be numerous today . The BBC itself has two at the ready : one at St. Just to film the eclipse itself , plus Diana 's to get the human interest angles . <p> " Do n't all relax at once , guys , " she says . " We 've got that village to do next . Got some locals to talk to . Eleven-fifteen and it 'll all be over , and we can get a drink . Or several . " <p> ADRIAN PUSHES the last newspaper through the last front door on his round and cycles down Trezillan 's narrow high street to the comer shop . He secures his bicycle and goes in . <p> He sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man is tall and about Morwenna 's age . You can tell from the way she 's laughing , from the way she 's leaning forward intently that she fancies him . She 's wearing a flimsy summer dress and you can see the top of her cleavage . Adrian looks down and uncomfortably shuffles his feet . <p> Morwenna looks up and sees him standing there . She waves at him . " Hi , Adrian ! " <p> The man straightens . " Well , I 'll see you this evening , Morwenna . " <p> " Sure . " <p> Adrian expects them to kiss , but they do n't . The man walks past him without saying a word . The doorbell tings as he goes out . <p> " Well , that was quick , " says Morwenna . " You 've finished your round already . Good boy . Give you a kiss . " <p> She comes out from behind the counter and stands next to him . She 's still taller than him , but he 's growing fast . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows he 's in love with her . She shakes out her long frizzy red hair . " It 's going to be a wonderful day . " She 's standing by the window where the sun comes in : it makes her dress translucent and you can see her knickers . She 's not wearing abra . <p> Morwenna Hughes was her father 's last child , late and unexpected . From what Adrian can gather , she lived for a while in Truro with a married man . But that did n't work out , so she came back to Trezillan and runs the corner shop now that her father has retired . <p> She stretches her arms out behind her head , her back arching slightly . She reminds Adrian of a cat luxuriating in the sun . He wonders what she looks like naked . <p> " What are you doing this morning , Adrian ? " she asks . <p> " I want to watch the eclipse , " he says . <p> " Mmmm , so do I. Should be good . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning . Mrs. Weldon , the local councilor , has used one of her contacts ; the BBC are sending a crew to film the eclipse from Trezillan . " Tell you what , is your Mum going ? " <p> " No , she 's at work . " <p> " Oh , that 's a pity . I 'll run you up there if you like . " <p> " Yes , please . " <p> " Just help me shut up shop . I need a wee . " She leans forward , touching his upper lip with her forefinger . For a moment he thinks she 's wiping a smudge off his cheek , just like his mother used to do . " Coo , look , " she says . " You 're growing a mustache . " <p> As he waits for her , he feels in his pocket for the scraps of old photographic negative the papers and TV said he should use to view the eclipse . He glances at the rack of cards . It 's Morwenna 's birthday next week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy her a card , but how can he do that without her knowing ? There 's no other place in the village to buy them . And would she pay more attention to him ? She 's twelve years older than he is . No chance . <p> At ! 0:30 the eclipse becomes partial . Through most of Britain it will be no more than that . But in Cornwall it continues its advance , a semicircular bite widening , black spreading over fire yellow . People look up at the sun , then take it for granted as they continue their tasks . But more and more abandon them as totality nears . The beach at Penzance is filled with watchers ; it 's too crowded to move . Some swim out and tread water to get a better view , squares of photographic negative on chains about their necks . A teenage girl faints in the heat and an ambulance man forces his way through the press of people and carries her out . They sit her on the steps leading down from the pavement , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Beth leave the bus at St. Just , the eclipse is only just partial , a black mouse-nibble at the top . They walk toward the town center , across the green with its gray stone war memorial , into the square . The pub is open , earlier than usual , and the outside chairs and tables are already full . <p> They go into the comer shop and buy packets of crisps to munch . Mary Beth buys a bottle of mineral water , Clive cider . At the edge of the square a portly middle-aged man has parked an ice-cream van . They buy a comet each . Clive has n't eaten ice cream in years ; it 's the traditional Cornish variety . The cold shocks the inside of his mouth ; he eats the ice cream in quick gulping bites before it melts . <p> " You ever been here before ? " asks Mary Beth . <p> " No , never . I 've been to Penzance , years ago , when I was a child . " He rubs his chin , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work colleagues see . He 'll spend a day unshaven , just for once . <p> " I 've never been to Europe before , " says Mary Beth . " And when I heard there was going to be this eclipse , I just had to come along . I 'd never seen one . " <p> " It 'll be quite a spectacle . " <p> " Sure . " She touches him lightly on the elbow . So self-confident . That is what he likes about her but wonders most at . Perhaps it comes with being American , he thinks : a self . confident race . It took him years to gather any sort of poise : he had shyness to overcome , and had to accustom himself to being gay . <p> They walk past the pub and down a side street toward a small church . Just before it is a graveyard . Already there 's a crowd , some of them sitting on the headstones . People of all ages from babes-in-arms to a ninety-something woman in a wheelchair . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them have telescopes set up to project the sun 's light onto cards . They 've passed several TV crews on the way here , but many other people have their own cameras , still or cine , or camcorders . Others are sitting on the ground with instruments Clive can only guess the function of . There are journalists here , too , who 'll send their copy through by cellfax when it 's all over . He instinctively feds inside his grip for his own camera , to check it 's still there . They sit down on the grass verge . She pulls her sweatshirt off over her head , drapes it over her shoulder . Clive notes the beads of perspiration on her upper lip , the damp dark circles under the arms of her T-shirt . <p> " Is that your lunch ? " he asks , looking at the bag of crisps , the bread rolls and cheese . <p> She grins . " I do n't eat much . " <p> " Traveling on a budget . I used to do that . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grins . Then she asks : " Where did you go ? " <p> " Oh , France , Germany , Italy , Switzerland ... " <p> " I 've been there , too . There 's some neat places there . I 'd like to see Eastern Europe ill have the time . " <p> " Well , you 've got plenty of time to do it in , Mary Beth . That was when I was a student , myself . " <p> " Before you settled down ? " <p> " I 'm not married , if that 's what you mean . " <p> " I figured you were n't . " <p> " I 'm gay , actually . " <p> She raises her eyebrows . " Really ? Oh , fine . " <p> They sit in silence for a while . Clive 's words have inhibited Mary Beth . She had n't realized he was gay , but perhaps that was why she felt safe with him . It 's not that she 's unused to homosexuals : there are enough of them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sexes  --  she counts as friends . Just a little disappointment : she has found him attractive , in a middle-aged kind of way . But it was only an idle fantasy : she 's committed to Todd , halfway across the world now . They 're already living together and , when the next semester starts , they 'll announce their engagement . <p> She loops her arms about her legs and draws them in to herself , resting her chin on her knees . <p> " Have you got a boyfriend ? " she asks . <p> " Yes , I have . His name 's Mark . He 's five years younger than me . He 's gone up North . A friend of ours is dying of AIDS . " <p> " I 'm sorry . Todd 's the same . He had to stay behind ; his Mom 's very ill . Cancer . " <p> " I 'm sorry for you both . " <p> Connections . Things in common . Mary Beth likes to find them . The similarities between her , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The coincidence of objective and meeting . The randomness from which your life coalesces , the unknown strange attractors that shape it . I sound like Todd , explaining what he does to me , she thinks . Todd is a mathematician working in Chaos Theory . She met him at a faculty dance and was attracted to him immediately . He 's tall , six four , tanned and blond , archetypal beach-California . She carries a photo of him in her backpack . <p> " You know , " Clive says . " I 've heard so much about this eclipse . I used to be really into astronomy when I was younger . They all mentioned this eclipse in Cornwall in 1999 . I just had to go and see it . Judging by Penzance and here , it looks like lots of people felt the same . " <p> " Well , it is a rare event . " <p> " The only total solar eclipse visible from the British Isles since 1954 , and it 'll be a long time until the next one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He remembers an animated diagram on one of the TV programs , inscribing the Line of View on a map of Cornwall from north of Penzance to south of Truro . <p> " Jeez , I never realized it was such a big deal , " says Mary Beth . " Suppose I should 've guessed . " <p> The van bumps as it goes up the hill toward Trezillan . " Fucking backwater , " Diana mutters . " It 's in the middle of fucking nowhere . " She takes a long drag on her cigarette . <p> " Well , we 're on the right track now , " says Tom . " We wo n't miss anything . " <p> " Why could n't a local crew do this ? " Diana goes on . " They 'll at least know where the tinpot little place is . Oh , no , Diana 'll do it . Good old Di . Give her the shit no one else wants . " <p> " We 're here , " says Tom . They pull up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green . A space is reserved for them . Stalls have been set up ; music plays from a ghetto blaster at one end . It 's mostly women here ' Diana notices : women with young children in tow , women who do n't work outside the house . <p> She renews her lipstick and steps out of the van . Tom goes back to help with the camera and sound equipment . Diana stands at the edge of the green ; a fiftyish woman in a dark suit strides across the grass toward her . <p> " Diana Mathis ? " <p> " Yes , that 's me . " <p> The woman extends a hand ; Diana takes it . " Good morning , Ms. Mathis . I 'm Margaret Weldon , the local councilor . We 're very privileged to have you here . " <p> Diana smiles . So many people thought the presence of a TV camera was doing them a favor . She knows this woman pulled a few strings to get the BBC here ; the event will add to her prestige @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of thing happens . " <p> Margaret Weldon smiles broadly . " Yes , it is rather exciting , is n't it ? I did n't realize they were quite so rare . And it 's such a lovely day for it , tOO ... " <p> The woman is much too fluttery for Diana 's taste . She continues talking as she leads Diana and the crew to the main marquee . " Do have a look around if you have time . We do take pride in our unspoiled little village . And I 'd be very grateful if you 'd have lunch with me . " <p> Silly old cow , thinks Diana . She probably does n't get too much excitement/n her Life . The soundman makes a chatterbox gesture behind Margaret Weldon 's back . Diana grins , and puts her finger to her lips . <p> At the other side of the green , Morwenna parks her car . She and Adrian walk across the grass to the stalls , Adrian one step behind . <p> " Now , you stay with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for you . Your Mum does n't know you 're here . " <p> " I can look after myself . " <p> " You say . " <p> " You 're being bloody bossy . " Adrian pouts . <p> Morwenna stops , tums , extends a finger . " Look , Adrian . You 're with me now . Do n't make me angry . " <p> " All right . " <p> She takes his hand and continues walking . So embarrassing . Morwenna is treating him like a child . He 's thirteen ; he 's not a baby anymore . He takes his hand away . <p> " Okay , suit yourself , " she says . " But do n't leave my sight . " <p> They pass in front of one stall , a tombola . The middle-aged woman behind it says , " Hello , Morwenna ! Are n't you running the shop today ? " <p> " It 's shut for the morning , Eileen , " she says . " I decided . Special occasion . " <p> " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past Morwenna to Adrian . <p> " This is Adrian . He does my paper round . He did it in record time this morning . " <p> " Hello , " says Adrian flatly . <p> " Well , the BBC have arrived , " Eileen adds . " Over there , by the marquee . " <p> Morwenna looks , shielding her eyes from the sun with her hand . Adrian tollows her gaze . A tall black woman is speaking to Mrs. Weldon . Something about the visitor fascinates him : the expensive suit , the twitchy manner . A city dweller , not at ease in the country . You do n't see many black faces in Trezillan . <p> " That 's Diana Mathis , " says Eileen . <p> " She looks prettier than she does on telly , " says Morwenna . " Come on , Adrian , let 's get a bit nearer . We might get our faces on the news . " <p> Over by the marquee , Diana tells Tom : " We 'll get a few overviews of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " <p> " Call me Margaret . Certainly . " <p> " We can do that any time . I 'd like to talk to some of those people out there . " <p> " I 'm sure that can be arranged . " <p> " And one of the k  --  children , too . That 'd add a nice touch . " <p> " That wo n't be any problem . " <p> " We wo n't get in anyone 's way . " <p> THE ECLIPSE reaches fifty percent partial , and more , the Sun has become an increasingly thinning crescent . The sky over Cornwall has darkened , and will darken still more as totality approaches . The temperature has dropped ; birds stop their wheeling in the sky and fly to their evening perches . Noisy children become quiet and still . <p> As he talks to Mary Beth , Clive senses that for once , their bodies do not matter . Masculinity and femininity no longer apply , no longer inhibit . A pure meeting of minds , and at last his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waistline , the thinning hair . He imagines his body hair melting away , his penis shrinking inward ; her breasts reabsorbed into her body , her vagina dosing up . But he opens his eyes again , and difference is still apparent : the swell of her breasts and hips , the white ridge of her bra through hefT-shirt . The ground is still hard on his buttocks . The body ca n't he wholly ignored . <p> Although he has a lover of two years ' standing , sex for him has always mattered less than companionship . He knows not everyone shares his view : certain past lovers certainly did n't . But companionship is what he has , if only briefly , with this young American woman , and sexuality can not muddle the equation . But he wo n't see her again after today$ before long she 'll be halfway across the globe , in another continent . He can buy her lunch , back in Penzance ; perhaps they 'll exchange addresses . Perhaps . <p> Near to them , a small black and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running back between the gravestones and over the wall to a nearby car engine . Clive has n't paid much attention to it , but occasionally lets himself be distracted by it . He watches an interview with a German man talking about how he was at the ' 91 Pacific eclipse and the ' 94 South American amongst others ; how he does not tire of watching eclipses and how everyone should witness one at least once in their lives  --  it 's a religious experience . <p> Clive nudges Mary Beth 's elbow and points at the TV set . That 's what it 's like for me , he thinks , something like that . Mary Beth looks up at him and smiles warmly . <p> Clive takes another swig of cider . He remembers when he was Mary Beth 's age , when he 'd be sitting somewhere like this of a weekend , a man beside him , slipping slowly into an amiable tipsiness . Alcohol always makes him expansive , and in an excess of goodwill he slips his arm about Mary Beth 's shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past , before public attitudes eased , he wanted to publicly embrace his lover , kiss him , the way he 'd seen heterosexual couples do , but he knew full well he could n't . But she does n't resist , accepts his gesture with utter calmness , moves in to the circle of his arm . <p> Mary Beth is not surprised when Clive rests his arm on her shoulders ; it 's a natural consequence of the ease of their acquaintance . She 's grown fond of him , as if he were a favorite uncle . She 'll stay with him today for as long as she can : she 'd prefer that to exploring St. Just , Penzance , Land 's End on her own . Perhaps they 'll keep in touch ; already she regards him as a friend . <p> " And now over live to Diana Mathis in Cornwall . " <p> " Thank you , Michael . Well , I 'm here at Trezillan village green , and we 're not far from totality now . Adrian  --  " and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is n't this an exciting event ? " <p> The camera moves in to a close-up of the boy , who is in his early teens . Clive does n't hear what the boy says , and only marginally registers his strong Cornish accent . I must have been like that , years ago , he thinks . In my case , the Moon landings ; in his case , this . He 'll never forget this day . He has n't become cynical , not like me , not like that reporter . She 's seen it all , possibly seen too much . So she does n't see anything at all . Tomorrow she 'll be interviewing an old lady who 's rescued a cat . It 's all one long blur of news . Other people 's lives do n't impact on her outside her own little circle , nor on me . But at least I 'm aware of it . But I do n't know quite what to do about it . <p> The sky is darkening , as the sun is reduced to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The seagulls are silent , mistaking the darkness for night . In St. Just there is no activity now : cars have stopped on the main road , even in the village center , and the drivers are looking out of their windows at the sun . Totality is very near . Mary Beth leans forward , puts her sweatshirt back on , settles back into the crook of Clive 's arm . <p> " It 's a beautiful sight , " she says . <p> " I 'm glad it 's come out this way , " says Clive . He has taken out his camera now ; it rests on his lap , ready . " What a disappointment if we could n't see the Sun . If it were overcast . ' <p> " The sky 'd still go dark . " <p> " But it would n't be the same . " <p> Mary Beth looks up again .

Portent of millennial disaster , or the time when , as they say , in its special darkness you can see yourself more clearly ? As thousands of people in Cornwall , and millions more live on television , watch , at 11:10 British Summer Time Total Eclipse 1999 begins . <p> The sky is night-dark , and there are stars . Venus , Jupiter , and Mercury are visible , their positions carefully noted by the astronomers present . The Moon is unyielding black , a hole in the sky . Around it is the opalescent ring of the solar corona , rippling like a net curtain . A red-orange prominence spark-spits out into space . Another curls round and joins itself : the hole formed is large enough to contain the Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes and twenty-three seconds of totality cameras click and whirr .
