Despite the presence of three Jesuits , including one bishop , on the program of the " International Humanae Vitae Conference " in Omaha , Neb . ( July 25-30 , 1993 ) , the Jesuit order came in for a good deal of criticism . The most serious criticism came from Archbishop J. Francis Stafford of Denver , who took strong exception to an article by Richard McCormick , S.J. , which suggested that the 1980 Synod of Bishops , which reaffirmed the teaching of Humanae Vitae , was " orchestrated with a foregone conclusion " ( America , 7/17 ) . Archbishop Stafford attended the Synod on the Family as chair of the U.S. Bishops ' Committee on Marriage and Family Life . He recounted the impressions he recorded in the diary he kept during the Synod , including the fact that the Pope made no effort " to discourage points of view with which he disagreed . " No bishop who objected to church doctrine on birth control or divorce " was ever spoken to , coerced , or given a raised eyebrow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archbishop Stafford put his outrage bluntly : " To hold such a view is to convict such distinguished churchmen as Godfried Cardinal Danneels of Belgium of participating in an ecclesiastical charade and deception . " One of the intentions of this essay is to dispel the notion that Jesuits as a group are against the teaching of Humanae Vitae . We shall do so by examining the McCormick article , showing that some of his main arguments against the teaching of Humanae Vitae are seriously flawed . But we would also like to present some more positive and substantive ideas heard frequently at the Omaha Conference about a distinction crucial to Humanae Vitae : that between natural family planning and artificial contraception . Let us begin with Archbishop Stafford 's point . The weight of his argument rests on his actual presence at the episcopal gathering : " I do not agree with Father McCormick .... I was at that Synod , and Father McCormick was not . " One might try to defend McCormick by noting that he never claims to have been at the Synod but simply employs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , beside the fact that this would only shift responsibility for the characterization of the Synod 's atmosphere , this defense would ignore an internal contradiction in Father McCormick 's own argument . He commends Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco for his courage in speaking openly at the Synod regarding his reservations about Humanae Vitae : " This was a careful , realistic and courageous statement . Careful  --  because the problem was stated accurately .... Courageous  --  because the suggestions were made in the presence of the Pope , whose views on this matter were well known . " But this judgment is very difficult to reconcile with Father Reese 's statement that " no true dialogue was really possible " at the Synod . The major part of the McCormick article , however , was not about the 1980 Synod , but about the doctrine of Humanae Vitae itself . Let us examine those arguments . They are , as we suggested above , seriously flawed . At one point , for instance , he says that the church 's position on the immorality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now know , of course , that Aristotle was wrong .... The relation of insemination to procreation , we now know , is not that of a per se cause to a per se effect . The relation of intercourse to procreation is statistical , the vast majority of acts not leading to conception . " Father McCormick 's conception of Aristotle 's understanding of causation is baffling . Aristotle , as is well known , had an extremely subtle doctrine of causes , of which he identified four types : material , efficient , formal and final . However , McCormick speaks of a type of cause that is not easy to identify with any of these four : " a per se cause . " At first blush he would seem to be saying that for Aristotle something that could be a cause always will be a cause , or ( making application to the present instance ) that the act of intercourse infallibly results in conception . He rather vaguely cites Aristotle 's On the Generation of Animals as proof of this claim , but Aristotle any number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could hardly ignore ! ) that the intercourse of animals often does not result in conception ( e.g. Bk. , II , 4 , 739a 26-28 ; see also History of Animals , Bk. , VII , 3 , 583a 15-27 ) . And , in any case , Aristotle was well aware of causation " for the most part . " Indeed , the case can be made that for Aristotle all natural causation is " for the most part . " So perhaps Father McCormick means that when intercourse leads to conception , the cause of the latter is " per se " ( i.e. actually occurring as a direct result of the former ) . But if this makes any sense at all , it is a simple truism : Corresponding to any particular effect there must be a cause . The 1827 discovery of the ovum , which McCormick cites , certainly does add much to our knowledge of the specific forms of the causes involved in procreation , but it does nothing to undermine Aristotelian causality or the Aristotelian observation that " male semen " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uterus to conceive a child . This brings us to our next point . In his attempt to repudiate the philosophical underpinnings of Humanae Vitae , McCormick employs some remarks by the well-known philosopher and theologian Bernard Lonergan , S.J. Lonergan argues that the relation of intercourse to procreation is only statistical , the vast majority of acts not leading to procreation . Lonergan asks if this statistical relationship is inviolable . " If it is , then even natural family planning in excluded . If it is not , then artificial contraception can be permissible under certain conditions . " But is it not obvious to McCormick that even an effect that results only sometimes from a cause can still be intended by the initiator of the cause ? A machine-gunner defending his post fires off many bullets he knows will not hit an enemy . He may even know that in a particular instance his chances of hitting an enemy are extremely small . But if he does hit an enemy , certainly he has done so intentionally . Since , therefore , intentional acts are precisely what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the point . The above objections to some of Father McCormick 's assertions are necessarily somewhat negative in character , but we would like to develop certain positive and substantive points as well . Time and again at the Omaha Conference we heard the stories of the experience of couples who chose to abandon the artificial contraception they were practicing in favor of the holistic approach of natural family planning ( N.F.P. ) . They told how much the communication and even the discipline and the sacrifices required by N.F.P. had bettered their marriages , had strengthened weak ties , had made their love for one another grow . What was going on here ? Why is it so ? According to Father Ronald Lawler , O.F.M. Cap. , " Every study shows that marriage goes better for couples who practice what the church teaches about sexuality . Their divorce rate is less than 5 percent while the rate for Catholic couples in general is over 40 percent . " While many couples entered N.F.P. from the fortunate position of good pre-Cana instruction and have had healthy marital relations from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couples referred to them for various reasons , even after long histories of contraceptive use . It sometimes happens , for instance , that the higher cardiopulmonary risks faced by women on the pill in their 30 's and 40 's brings them to seek a natural method . But even these non-religious motivations for using N.F.P. instead of the pill often yield to the inner logic of personal relations . N.F.P. only works if spouses work at better communication about their intimate life together and are being respectful of the natural fertility of one another 's bodies . By a path that a husband " too macho " to consider vasectomy may not suspect , tenderness and gentleness have been found to grow along with the self-discipline N.F.P. requires . But this does not deal with the two most substantive points Father McCormick rightly raises as crucial to reasonable moral discourse about artificial contraception : 1 ) the reasons for the absolute prohibition on artificial contraception in any act of intercourse as intrinsically disordered , and 2 ) the persistent confusion in public discussion about any significant moral difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is wrong with artificial contraception is not that it is technological . Perhaps the most amazing part of the Omaha Conference was the information it provided about technologies now available to help couples experiencing infertility . Not only hormonal therapies , but sophisticated methods for cooperating with even highly irregular fertility cycles have been discovered . The scientific research that has been conducted to make the Ovulation Method ( Billings ) as precise as it is for pinpointing the time of ovulation and the window of fertility in a woman 's cycle has relied heavily on new technology . So , the moral distinction between N.F.P. and artificial contraception does not depend on the use of technology . Rather , what is wrong with artificial contraception is its anti-life intention , its deliberate destruction of the procreative potential of an act of intercourse . McCormick is quite right to note that a couple who use N.F.P. to avoid conception through the whole period of their fertile married years would be in a moral situation comparably precarious to that of a couple using artificial contraception in even a single instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to exclude children . To grasp the distinction between a natural and an artificial method of birth regulation , it is crucial to note the type of choices and decisions at work . What would make a whole marriage ruled by the intention to avoid children through N.F.P. morally flawed is exactly what makes any act of intercourse that has been rendered sterile by some artificial birth control morally wrong : the same anti-life intention . Surely , when N.F.P. couples use the sterile period , they do not directly intend the procreative meaning of intercourse  --  that 's just what they 've chosen to avoid  --  but the type of decision they 've made shows how much they respect the procreative powers with which they have been created . Is n't the difference this : that artificial contraception goes further than avoiding the likelihood of procreation by the use of a naturally infertile period ? Instead , it directly and deliberately attacks fertility and repudiates the procreative meaning of sexual intercourse . The principle of totality often invoked by McCormick , according to which what counts is the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It does so precisely because every act of artificial contraception directly attacks the potential of an act of intercourse to be procreative . Why does Paul VI insist in Humanae Vitae on the intrinsic disorder of every act of contraceptive intercourse ? It is not simply that it is sterile , for the church approves and allows a marriage when couples know that some bodily condition will make procreation impossible . Since there is no direct attack on fertility , one may presume good faith , that couples would be open to God 's gift of children were they to come  --  or at least there is no reason to assume they have an anti-life disposition . But the choice to render oneself sterile , whether by some permanent form of sterilization such as a vasectomy or tubal ligation or some more temporary method , involves an intentional separation of the procreative from the unitive dimension of the marital act by excluding the former . It is precisely on this point that we find that John Paul II has tried to supply a new form of reasoning to support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new contribution to reasonable discussion of the issue McCormick requests . To elucidate the case Paul tried to make in Humanae Vitae by explaining that the unitive meaning of marital intercourse may not be separated from the procreative meaning , John Paul II has worked out an explanation in terms of the language of the body , an argument that is not limited to what McCormick dismisses as exclusive concentration on the " physical structure of the act , " but rather is focused precisely on understanding the interpersonal communication of the language of sexual intercourse . What does the language of sex say ? In its natural form it says : " I find you attractive . I trust you with my most intimate self . I would never hurt you . I desire to be with you completely and absolutely , even to have a child with you . " By contrast , the language of contracepted ( " protected " ) sex says : " I desire to be one with you , but not fully . I want to engage in an act of great but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept responsibility for anything that may follow ; I do not want my life that tightly bound up with yours . " The language of sex is subtle and allusive , but there is a definite objectivity to it . Like any language , what it says is constant , even though a couple might be employing it on a particular occasion without personally meaning or believing what they are saying as they employ it . Thus , it is no counterargument to the Pope to point out , as Lisa Sowle Cahill ( quoted by McCormick ) does , that often a couple engaging in a contracepted act of intercourse feel as if their union is perfectly loving . The basis of the Pope 's position is neither physical acts nor personal feelings but signs and symbols : These point to the most profound of human and religious realities and do so whether we want them to or not . According to Professor Janet Smith of the University of Dallas , author of Humanae Vitae : a Generation Late an act of intercourse is meant to be a reinstatement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor in the sexual act . By making this natural communication a kind of lie , contraception violates the unitive dimension as well as the procreative dimension . There is not only the rarely mentioned factor that contraception facilitates adultery and conduct devastating to marriages , but the subtle negativity it introduces toward one 's body and one 's spouse . Whether Norplant or the pill , contraception communicates a certain disdain for one 's natural fertility . Professor Smith speculates that perhaps there is even an abiding anger toward God for having made me and my spouse fertile . It thus stands in contrast with the practice of N.F.P. , whereby the reading of one 's bodily signs everyday involves a respect for the fertility of oneself and one 's spouse . The experience of the 25 years since Humanae Vitae is telling . The sexual revolution continues unabated . The numbers of unwanted pregnancies , abortions and divorces are still sky-rocketing . Even if one were to argue purely by considering the happy and unhappy consequences of a policy , the easy availability of contraceptives add the popular perception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major contributor to the growth of these problems by virtue of having separated the procreative and unitive meanings of intercourse . Even a philosophic consequentialist would have to judge contraception to be an utter failure of a strategy . But the deeper reasons for acknowledging the profound truths enunciated in Humanae Vitae come from understanding fully the depths of human personhood and learning about the language of sex in the communication of spouses . Kevin Flannery , S.J. , teaches ancient philosophy at the Gregorian University in Rome . Joseph Koterski , S.J. , teaches natural law ethics at Fordham University , Bronx , N.Y . A RESPONSE I am distressed , of course , that the Society of Jesus " came in for a good deal of criticism " at the International Humanae Vitae Conference in Omaha . I do not know what form it took or whether it was deserved . But before one allows one 's distress to fester and ferment , it is always wise to consider its source . In other words , if the Society of Jesus was pilloried , it just might reflect far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could it be that Fathers Flannery and Koterski should examine the company they keep ? Be that as it may , I find it curious that Flannery-Koterski feel the need " to dispel the notion that Jesuits as a group " are opposed to Humanae Vitae . Those who know Jesuits , as I do , know that they are rarely for or against anything as a group . They are , thank God , too honest and independent  --  some would say fractious-for that . I know many Jesuits who do not accept the thesis that every contraceptive act is morally wrong . But that is hardly startling . The same thing could be said of huge numbers of theologians , priests , educators , lay people , etc. , who have not been contaminated by Jesuits . But to be on the safe side . let me note that in what follows I speak for none of my revered brothers , nor do I claim that many would share my ideas , though I am delighted that in the past many have . Let me get a nonsubstantial matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1980 Synod on the Family was " orchestrated . " That word was used instead of my original wording ( " rigged " ) at the enlightened suggestion of the editors of America . My earlier wording originated with a high and perceptive ecclesiastic who was present at the Synod . Nothing I have heard from Archbishop J. Francis Stafford has altered my view . Archbishop Stafford denies my assertion and states that he was at the Synod while I was not . No orchestration without representation , so to speak . Flannery-Koterski , citing the Archbishop , note : " No bishop who objected to church doctrine on birth control or divorce " was ever spoken to , coerced or given a raised eyebrow . " I never said they were . But there need not be coercion , raised eyebrows or verbal assaults to have " orchestration " or manipulation . Peter Hebblethwaite used the terms " manipulation " and " stage management " ( National Catholic Reporter , Aug. 27 , 1993 ) to describe that 1980 Synod . This will surprise only those innocent of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . There were robust attempts at it during Vatican II , just as there are now . Flannery-Koterski claim to find an " internal contradiction " in my commendation of Archbishop John A. Quinn 's synodal intervention and my approving citation of Father Thomas Reese 's statement that " no true dialogue was really possible " at the Synod ( Am. , 11/8/80 ) . I am amazed and amused at this attribution of " internal contradiction . " It implies that anytime a bishop at a synod makes a careful and courageous statement , we have the possibility of dialogue . Enough said . I shall not linger here on the matter except to say that synods subsequent to 1980 have done nothing but reinforce my original assertion . In what follows I want to address two main concerns : 1 ) Aristotle and church teaching ; 2 ) the allegation that every contraceptive act is wrong and natural family planning ( N.F.P. ) is not . Flannery-Koterski find my discussion of Aristotle " baffling . " Specifically , they say that I speak of a cause " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of Aristotle ( material , efficient , formal , final ) . Actually I wrote of Aristotle : " Male seed was viewed as an efficient cause that changed the nutritive material supplied by the female . " That seems to me fairly easy to identify with Aristotle 's efficient cause . Their bafflement is apparently rooted in my use of the term " per se cause . " Since I was not writing for a scientific journal and audience , I did not elaborate . But the phrase obviously does not mean that " the act of intercourse infallibly results in conception . " It means that intercourse was viewed as having a certain structure . Of itself it was procreative . As Bernard Hiring puts it : " For centuries the church shared the common belief that each conjugal act was , by its very " nature , " procreative and could only accidentally fail to be so " ( Contraception : Authority and Dissent , ed. by C. Curran , 176 ) . That is what " per se cause " means . But the usage " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is Bernard Lonergan 's . Indeed that section of my article was a loose paraphrase of a letter that the brilliant Jesuit theologian wrote in 1968 , after the appearance of Humanae Vitae , to a certain Father Ora McManus . With permission , I reproduce here the pertinent paragraphs from the Lonergan Studies Newsletter ( v. 11 , 1990 , pp. 7-8 ) . Dear Father , In answer to your request I would note that traditional Catholic doctrine on the sexual act followed rigorously from the position adopted by Aristotle in his De generatione animalium . That position was that the seed of the male was an instrumental cause that changed the matter supplied by the female into a sentient being . As was argued from the instance of wind-eggs , the female by herself got no further than a nutritive principle . The efficient causality of the male was needed to produce the sensitive principle or soul . On that basis it was clear that every act of insemination was of itself procreative and that any positive interference as an act of obstructing the seed in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have combined to bring about a notable change in the views of Catholic theologians on this matter . The first , of course , is the fact that the Aristotelian position is erroneous . Insemination and conception are known now to be quite distinct . The act of inseminating is not an act of procreating in the sense that of itself per se , it leads to conception . The relation of insemination to conception is just statistical and , far more frequently than not , insemination does not lead to conception . So there arises the question whether this statistical relationship of insemination to conception is sacrosanct and inviolable . Is it such that . no matter what the circumstances , the motives , the need 's , and deliberate modification of the statistical relationship must always be prohibited ? If one answers affirmatively , he is condemning the rhythm method . If negatively he permits contraceptives in some cases . Like the diaphragm and the pill . the menstrual chart and the thermometer directly intend to modify the statistical relationship nature places between insemination and conception . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the change in Catholic theological opinion . It is that sexual intercourse between man and wife both expresses and fosters their mutual love . This is fully acknowledged in Vatican II and also in Humanae Vitae . Aristotle treated not marital intercourse but generation as common to all animals . His oversight has been corrected by contemporary phenomenological inquiry . While the Encyclical acknowledges the " unitive sense " of marital intercourse , it claims that inseparable from it there is a " procreative sense . " This would be easy enough to understand if one still clung to Aristotle 's biology . But in contemporary biology , if insemination may be said to be inseparable from normal intercourse , conception can not be said to be inseparable from insemination . The discharge of two million spermatozoa into the vagina does not mean or intend two million babies . Most of the time it does not mean or intend any babies at all . The relationship of insemination to conception is not the relation of a per se cause to a per se effect . It is a statistical relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some conceptions . In my opinion such opinions as are expressed in phrases like " actus per se aptos ad generandum " " acts intrinsically appropriate for generating " and " process open to conception " are transitional . They reformulate the Aristotelian position and the resultant Catholic tradition during the interval between the discovery that Aristotelian biology is mistaken and the discovery that marital intercourse of itself : per se , is an expression and sustainer of love with only a statistical relationship to conception . I have concentrated on what I consider the main issue . Much seems deliberately done to obscure it . The issue is not whether or not people have to have reasons for accepting the Pope 's decision . The issue is that , when there is no valid reason whatever for a precept , that percept is not of natural law . Again , re dissent , Vatican II refused to oblige theologians to silence after the Pope determined controverted issues . See Orsy , America , August 17 , 1968 , p. 99 , central column , top . This letter speaks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fathers Flannery and Koterski have in mind when they conclude that " the Lonergan argument is beside the point . " They talk of machine-gunners and multiple misfires and intentions in a way that is at best opaque . The authors state that the discovery of the ovum in 1827 " does nothing to undermine Aristotelian causality or the Aristotelian observation that " male semen " must act upon " the secreted female material " within the uterus to conceive a child . " Possibly correct , but not to the point . What the discovery of the ovum does is undercut the false idea that intercourse is " by its very " nature " procreative " ( Hiring ) or is a " per se cause " ( Lonergan ) . The idea stated in these phrases rested on Aristotelian biology and was shared by Catholic thinkers until the 19th century . With the biology available , they could do little else . That is why theologians for centuries held the intent to procreate essential to the rectitude of sexual intercourse . That is why so many church Fathers considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to my second point : the allegation that every contraceptive act is wrong and N.F.P. is not . Briefly , according to Flannery-Koterski , every contraceptive act involves an " anti-life intention . " They restate this anti-life intention with phrases such as " repudiates the procreative meaning of sexual intercourse , " " directly attacks the potential of an act of intercourse to be procreative . " They see this " anti-life intention " not only in every contraceptive act , but in the use of N.F.P. for the whole period of the fertile years of marriage . In their words : " McCormick is quite right to note that a couple who use N.F.P. to avoid conception through the whole period of their fertile married years would be in a moral situation comparably precarious to that of a couple using contraception in even a single instance . " They would have the same " anti-life intention . " Here a few remarks are in order . First , I have never made any such assertion , nor should any Catholic theologian . I am pained to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious theological blunder . They attribute an " anti-life intention " to N.F.P. practiced for the entire duration of the marriage . This contradicts the teaching of Pius XII . In his famous Address to the Midwives ( 1951 ) Pius XII noted the importance of fertile marriage to individuals , society and the church itself . He concluded : Consequently , to embrace the state of matrimony , to use continually the faculty proper to it , and in it alone , and on the other hand to withdraw always and deliberately without a grave motive , from its primary duty , would be to sin against the very meaning of conjugal life . Serious motives , such as those which are frequently present in the so-called " indications "  --  medical , eugenic , economic and social  --  can exempt from this positive , obligatory contribution prestazione is the untranslatable Italian word the pope usedfor a long time , even for the entire duration of the marriage ( my emphasis ) . On Sept. 12 , 1958 , shortly before his death , Pius XII , in an Address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportionate motives . " Clearly , then , Pius XII saw no " anti-life intention " in the use of natural family planning " even for the entire duration of the marriage " if there was , in his language , a " serious proportionate motive . " Flannery-Koterski , however , do see such an intention in this duration-of-the-marriage practice . This erroneous rigorism ( contrary to Pius XII ) leads one to believe that they have a penchant for finding anti-life intentions where they do not and need not exist  --  that is , in any contraceptive act . If " serious proportionate motives " ( which Pius XII described in a talk of Nov. 26 , 1951 , as " indeed quite broad "  --  in verita ben larghi ) remove any anti-life intention from the lifelong practice of N.F.P. , many theologians wonder why the same is not the case with contraceptive acts . Flannery-Koterski refer not only to an " anti-life intention " but to an " anti-life disposition " and associate this with an individual contraceptive act . That is precisely what most theologians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sowle Cahill 's words from her John Courtney Murray Forum Lecture : " Nor is their valuing of parenthood based on their experience of isolated sex acts as having a certain " procreative structure " ( AM. , 5/22 ) . Cahill could just as easily have written : " Nor is the presence of an anti-life intention necessarily to be found in isolated contraceptive acts if a " serious proportionate motive " is present , anymore than it is in the marriage-long practice of N.F.P .. " Flannery-Koterski try to establish this " anti-life disposition " by seeing sexual intimacy as language . They assert : " The language of contracepted ( ' protected ' ' ) sex says : " I desire to be one with you , but not fully . I want to engage in an act of great but momentary pleasure with you , but I am unwilling to accept responsibility for anything that may follow , I do not want my life that tightly bound with yours . ' ' " Most married couples would rightly be insulted by this . They would judge it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those determined to defend a position . Why could they not read a contracepted act as follows : " I desire to be with you completely and absolutely , now and forever . Our sexual intimacy expresses and nourishes this resolve . It must , of course , be responsible and take into account " serious proportionate motives " mentioned by Pius XII . That is the meaning of our present avoidance of children " ? An understanding very close to this was presented in these pages more than a decade ago by theologian John H. Wright , S.J. ( Am. , 3/7/81 ) . The notion that any form of contraception , but not N.F.P. , may express " an anger toward God for having made me and my spouse fertile " is the type of wild and desperate salvo that brings ridicule on a whole movement . In conclusion , then , we are left with a prohibition still searching for an argument , what Lonergan referred to as " no valid reason whatever for a precept . " My two esteemed Jesuit brothers may still want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . But three quick points . First , those who disagree with them should not be adjudged as defenders of irresponsible sexual behavior . That simply begs the question , a point two philosophers ought certainly to see . All the people I know who have problems with Humanae Vitae condemn any form of selfish and irresponsible sexual behavior . Second , I urge Flannery-Koterski , in crafting their arguments , to be deeply acquainted with their own history and tradition so they do not unwittingly contradict it . Finally , in an impish aside sure to provoke either giggles or glowers , I note that when a gathering ( like the Omaha meeting ) includes only or largely those who agree , analyses can easily get flabby . Opposition purifies arguments . That is why celebrations are not always clarifications . And that is why the church  --  like America magazine with this exchange  --  must always remain open to the commercialization of ideas , not simply for credibility , but , as the old Jesuit Rules put it , " in order that the truth may appear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.

" Young Web users grow up to be teen social networkers , IM users , and phone texters , " says Anne Collier , codirector of connectsafely.org . " So the earlier they learn appropriate behavior , the better . " <p> THE BAD But just how appropriately are these avatars behaving ? It 's true that Club Penguin , like many other sites , works overtime to keep the chat civil . CP filters out rude language and personal information , lets kids act as secret agents and report rule breakers , and provides monitors to discourage bad behavior . According to Lane Merrifield , cofounder of Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Online Studios , the filters are modified almost hourly to keep up with kids ' changing slang . " We strive every day to improve and be the best , safest site out there , " he says . <p> Still , I saw cyber-savvy kids come up with all kinds of clever ways to evade these precautions , like putting consecutive words in separate cartoon bubbles ( " I " " DO " " NOT " " LIKE " " YOU " ) . CP 's safeguards are updated so often that some of the talk and tactics I observed are already impossible  --  and probably more will be by the time this story is printed . But kids find a way . While many penguins were amicable , I was called " weirdo " twice and " nerd " three times , told to go away six times , and pummeled with snowballs and mean-face emoticons . ( Merrifield explained that the site allows some words that can be negative  --  nerd , geek  --  if some kids identify themselves that way . ) <p> " It stands to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Collier , " because it happens in school and on the playground , too . " But in the virtual world , the inherent anonymity compounds the problem . " Kids may be much more likely to say things through an online avatar that they would n't say in person , " says Debbie Glasser , Ph.D. , a clinical psychologist in Richmond , VA , and founder of newsforparents.org . While kids also misbehave on the real playground , in cyberspace , they assume they 're anonymous , even invisible , and because the virtual world is " just a game , " they do n't feel the accountability  --  or guilt  --  they would in real life , where they have to confront their victims . <p> L : 2 All Play Is Not Created Equal During my time on Club Penguin , I became a regular at the local pizzeria . I liked the clich Italian piano music , the cozy candlelit tables , and the brick oven ; but mostly , I was fascinated by the friendly waiters who never , ever delivered my pizza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given my order to 16 different penguins and not have even a slice . But then I realized that these kids were only pretending to be waiters and waitresses . And they thought I was pretending to be a customer . We were playing an old-fashioned game of " let 's pretend " in a newfangled setting . <p> THE GOOD Playing make-believe is part of the magic of being a kid , and Club Penguin 's fanciful locales , exotic costumes , and colorful avatars seem to invite it . From a parent 's perspective , the site is an innocent , welcome oasis in an online wasteland of XXX Web sites and potentially risky teen social-networking forums . From a child 's perspective , it looks like a new , and highly accessorized , way to play . <p> THE BAD But unlike traditional imaginative play , CP and other sites generally do n't let kids dream up places like the Italian-restaurant scene  --  graphic designers do it for them . Merrifield says his team 's goal is to be the " stewards of creativity , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example . But I 'm not convinced . Kids ' opportunities to pretend creatively on these preconceived sites seem sadly limited , as they did in that caf ( which appears to be meant more as a hangout than a place to play food server : Witness the lack of pizza ! ) . And the sites ' games are n't fueled so much by children 's imaginations as by preprogrammed , circumscribed choices . <p> " Creative play allows young children to digest life and make it their own . It 's an outlet for their creativity and an absolutely critical part of childhood , " states Joan Almon , director of the U.S. branch of Alliance for Childhood . But when kids spend hours in front of screens  --  TV , video game , or computer  --  they 're just absorbing other people 's stories and imaginations and not creating their own . " That 's resulted in a steady decline in children 's play , " says Almon , " and will have serious negative consequences for kids ' cognitive , emotional , and physical development . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like many similar sites , may bill itself as being all about collecting friends , but believe me , it 's about collecting a lot more than that . Like the sparkly-pink evening gowns ( 600 coins ) , wide-screen TVs ( 5,000 coins ) , and Ice Castle igloo upgrades " crafted from the finest ice on Club Penguin " ( 5,100coins ) that I saw during my 14 days of penguinhood . <p> Which is why ChilyLily437 decided to go to work . On CP , that means playing video games . Fortyfive ( excruciating ) minutes of digital ice fishing later , I 'd accumulated enough coins to get shopping . <p> But when I tried to make my purchases , a message informed me that I could n't buy any of these items because I was not a member ! However , I could become a member if I 'd like ... for $58 a year ( and I do n't think they were talking penguin money ) . <p> THE GOOD As CP 's Parent 's Guide points out , virtual-world economies give kids a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earning comes before spending helps foster a good work ethic . The avalanche of appealing , if imaginary , merchandise teaches children about making financial choices and even basic math . As a teacher and a mom , I agree that CP can help kids learn these crucial life skills . And CP does not run outside advertisements . <p> THE BAD " Parents should never forget that most of these sites are moneymaking ventures , " warns Liz Perle , editor in chief of Common Sense Media . " The behavior they encourage  --  playing games to build up ' money ' kids ca n't spend without paying real cash  --  is driven by commercial impulses . " <p> So maybe I was naive , but I 'm still not sure which part is most disturbing : ( a ) that Club Penguin is perpetuating such a materialistic mind-set ; ( b ) that it 's bribing kids with cyber loot to play otherwise pointless video games all day ; or ( c ) that it 's getting away with this bait-and-switch routine ( " free Club Penguin account , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , despite CP 's strict policies against it , so many kids have found off-site ways to cheat so they do n't have to " earn " coins or rewards at all . Regardless , the result is to spur kids ' materialism , both online ( as penguins ) and off ( as potential paying members ) . <p> L : 4 In Cyberspace , Kids GrowUp Evers Faster I 'm not exaggerating when I say that at any given moment in any given location on Club Penguin , there 's someone saying " Cute girlz " or " I like boyz " or " Will u be my girlfriend ? "  --  which is exactly what a penguin whom I 'll call Kingpizmo asked me one moonlit night in his igloo . <p> We 'd met earlier at the pizza parlor when I 'd answered his open call for available girls . By the time we got to Kingpizmo 's crib ( the Taj Mahal of igloos ) , we 'd already swapped heart emoticons and mwah mwahs ( kisses ) . We played a few rounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissing " game ) before he popped the question , and I ( trying not to think about how appalled Kingpizmo would be if he knew he 'd just asked a married mother of four to go steady ) accepted . <p> THE GOOD Try as I might , I 'm having trouble seeing an upside here . <p> THE BAD Of all my virtual-world surprises , I found CP 's sexual undercurrent by far the most shocking . Kafai was less surprised . " Flirting and dating are major parts of kids ' virtual-world activity , " she says . " The anonymity and lack of parental supervision make them favorite spaces for even tweens to act out sexual themes they see in the media and at the playground , even before they 're ready in real life . " But such cyber dating can actually hinder their ability to develop off-line relationships , says Marshall P. Duke , Ph.D. , clinical psychologist at Emory University . " In the real world , people communicate in many ways  --  body language , facial expressions , gestures , and tone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may think they understand relationships based on online experiences , and that can be damaging . " <p> L : Smart Rules for Virtual Play Realistically , we ca n't raise Internet-free kids  --  nor should we . But here 's what I 've learned about helping your child find a balance between virtual worlds and the real one . <p> * Be His Copilot Understanding your kid 's virtual world is a must , even if it means going undercover yourself . Then go online with him as he explores the site . " You would n't put your child in a car , hand him the keys , and say ' See ya , ' " says Perle . " Do n't do it with the Internet. " * Teach Her How to Act Provide your kid with clear behavior guidelines for the virtual world , just as you do for the real one . " Before letting your child access a site , discuss how to be a good online friend , " says Patricia Agatston , Ph.D. , coauthor of Cyber Bullying : Bullying in the Digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inappropriate behavior from others ( like flirtation , questions about age , bullying ) and will tell you if it happens so that you can report the offender to site authorities . * Use Parental Controls and Monitoring Software Protect your child while giving him the appropriate level of independence with Web site parental controls ( Club Penguin offers some excellent ones that allow parents to control when and for how long kids can use the site ) and monitoring software ( like those listed in the searchable database at getnetwise.org ) . Be up-front with kids from the start about keeping an eye on them . * Say When ( and Mean It ) Common Sense Media recommends waiting until your child 's eighth birthday before letting her join a social network . Once you do , the American Academy of Pediatrics advises limiting kids to no more than two hours a day of any kind of screen time . And balance it out with real face time with friends : These sites were never meant to replace going outside and playing . * 35 million kids are registered members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids ' social-networking sites either live or in development <p> By Sharon Duke Estroff <p>
