Things pile up when the wife goes camping for nine days with her exboyfriend // ENJOY TELLING FRIENDS , coworkers , even my mother what my wife 's up to : " Uwe and Karen are going camping in Virginia . " " Uwe ? " Mom says over the phone . " Do I know her ? " " It 's German-oo-va . He 's Karen 's old boyfriend from Germany . " Mom 's mouth clicks , but no words . Then , simply : " Oh . " My mother is no longer any fun with this sort of thing , because she decided a long time ago that it was best to let my weirdness alone . But others come through . My coworker Ben , for example : " You got ta be fucking kidding me . " That 's more like it . I smile . Ben wants an explanation . Is my marriage on the rocks ? Am I crazy ? " No , everything 's fine . " " You let her do this ? " " They 're old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head-something he 'll do , with a little smirk , every time he and I cross paths for a day or two . Karen and Uwe go way back . She met him on a kibbutz in Israel when she was nineteen . They fell madly in love , traveled around Europe together , carried on a transatlantic romance for two years . Then I met Karen ; things with Uwe had already cooled . Eventually , she understood that they were too much alike . But that 's why they 've remained so closethey both have to travel , escape . They emerge somewhere new , blinking in the sun ; the never-before-seen wipes away all the stuff of ordinary life they do n't want to deal with , and for a moment anything seems possible . I hate to travel . But from the first day we got together , Karen wanted me . No one else-she made that patently clear . So I had no problem , when we were living together in California ten years ago , with her flying to New York to meet Uwe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way she and I did not . When Karen came home a week later , she told me how her cousin , embarrassed at how affectionate she was with Uwe at her family 's beach house , blurted to a bunch of his friends : " Can you believe she 's engaged ? " Karen and I shook our heads over this Neanderthal view . She 's gone to Bremen to see Uwe a few times since we 've been married . The last time , they met up with her high school friend Mona . Mona is a stockbroker in Munich . She 's getting rich . She bought the three of them an expensive meal , and when Uwe got up to use the bathroom , Mona barely waited until he was out of earshot : " You mean to tell me you 're not sleeping with him ? " Karen and I wonder what everyone is so . . . afraid of . But this time , midweek of Karen 's camping trip , something happens . I 've wrangled a sweet deal with my boss to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two sons up , shoo them off to school , get some writing done , I 've got the afternoons to be alone , to drift . The world 's on hold . A perfect little block of free time . I skip over the Delaware from my rural corner of Jersey to a bookstore . Then , coming home , on a strip of highway that slices through woods , I nail a deer , ramming her before my foot even gets to the brake . A big sideways skid into the grass berm does n't do any good . A state cop shows up fast . I do not like cops-the absurd formal authority . But right now , I 'm relieved to see this guy . He prods the doe with his boot , comes over to me . " I 'm not sure if she 's dead , " he admits . My statey is young . We take a look at the front of my Forddrivable . He asks if I need a report for insurance . I do n't . But we have to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prods again , nods . I join him . Her eyes are wide open , but she 's gone . We each grab a leg and pull her off . That 's it , then . But I do n't want him to go . I hold him by explaining how I never saw the doe , how her head appeared above my fender and I hit her before I could do anything . He nods-he does n't need to know this , but he 'll give me another minute or two . We stand there , two men weighing a bit of trouble . Suddenly the trouble floods me this way : " My wife has gone camping for a week with her ex-boyfriend from Germany ! I 'm all alone ! " I do n't say it , of course . My nice young cop nods goodbye , leaves . I drive home , find a crowbar , get the hood of the car open , begin to laugh about the whole thing . I stand back and look at my car , missing half the grille like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unable to sleep . The dead deer is a warning . They 're out there somewhere , Karen and Uwe , in the Shenandoah Valley , drinking wine in a tent , maybe nuzzling each other . But that 's not the problem ; I trust my wife on that score , do n't I ? Yes , I do . Are we asking for too much , Karen and I ? I 've always laughed at the double-headed monster " we " that most couples create . But then I imagine that deer smashing through my side window , stomping me instead of vice versa . I 'm guilty of something . I do n't know what . The first time Uwe came to visit , Karen had high hopes for the three of us . He landed in New York , hitched across the country . The first night , Uwe and I kept a wary distance . He is incredibly tall and thin , with long blond hair halfway down his back . ( I cut mine years ago . ) He has a perfect Teutonic face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he does n't bathe much . In bed that night , Karen seemed too nice . Not sexual , just pleasant . She was checking on me , seeing if I was okay . The next morning , she went off to work ; Uwe and I went out for cappuccinos at a cafe . I bought three newspapers-those days , I eased toward work . I usually sat inside but figured he would want some spectacular Bay Area light . ( I got under an umbrella , at least . ) I started with the Giants . Uwe sipped his cappuccino but was n't touching the papers . I looked at him . He looked at me-I was being rude . So I said , slow and loud as if talking to some old-country person who is slightly deaf : " What is it that you do in the morning , when you get up ? " Uwe cocked his head , translating . " When you get up in the morning , what- ? " " Yeah . " He understood . " Usually , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And maybe I have a biscuit . And then I go to work . " I nodded and smiled . Uwe nodded and smiled . I had three sports pages to get through , writing to do . I went back to the Giants for a moment . " And what is it , " Uwe said , " that you do in the morning ? " He gestured to the coffee , the papers . " This ? " It would have sounded ridiculous to tell him in slow , clean sentences that I needed to start the day by wasting some time . So I . . . shrugged . Then went back to the Giants . Uwe asked which way the train to San Francisco was . I pointed ; he bolted . I gave all three sports pages a workout . A smart guy , Uwe-somebody who speaks a few languages , paints , travels the world , works with mentally ill adults . I went home and wrote badly . In bed that night , Karen asked what I thought of him . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wondered . " He 's a nice guy . " " But ... " " No but . A little hard to talk to . A little-I do n't know . We 're different . It 's fine . " I will always remember Karen 's shadowed face , how pleased with me she was , making this okay . Now , lying in bed alone , I understand why I feel guilty : My smugness over Uwe 's presence-the idea that I 'm a lot tougher than some asshole who forbids his wife to have a life-is bullshit . A big put-on . Honestly , I do n't want him around . ON THE MORNING Karen and Uwe are due to return , I bathe the boys , trim my beard , make sure the toilet bowl shines . I have n't seen Uwe yet this go-round because Karen picked him up at the Philly airport ; they made a beeline for Virginia . We go out and buy an azalea for Mom , leave it on the dining-room table . They 're giddy with anticipation . Karen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each other ; she hugs and kisses her boys . I make a fist , do a little boxer 's hop , tap Uwe on the shoulder . He makes a fist , does a little boxer 's hop , taps me on the shoulder . A couple of regular old chums . Karen announces that she is exhausted and goes upstairs . That 's all ? Uwe and my sons and I mill around the living room for a few minutes as if we 're casing the joint for a game of musical chairs . I escape , go up and lie down with Karen . " Are you okay ? " I say . " I 'm fine . " She 's turned the other way . " Just completely beat . I have n't slept for two days . " " Why not ? Why ca n't you sleep ? " She sighs-she often has trouble sleeping . I cover fast for the neediness in my voice : " I killed a deer " She turns over . " You did ? What happened ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brakes . The car 's okay . " She senses something more , brushes my cheek with her hand . I feel sillyjust a goddamn deer . We hold hands silently , watch each other . Then she turns back over , taking my hand with her so that I hover above . " What are we doing tomorrow ? " I wonder . " We 're going to the beach . " She does n't mean with me . She means with him . " After I 've spent the last week . . . " " He has three more days , " Karen tells me . " I ca n't just make him hang around here . " " And who is taking care of the kids ? " She sighs . " They have school . " " I know that , Karen . " I go downstairs . Uwe is giving my sons German coins as presents . There is nothing to do but carry on . " I 'll be downstairs doing laundry , " I inform them . My sons do n't look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , goes to his backpack , rummages , and produces a pair of dangerously dark blue underwear . He hands them to me . A FEW WEEKS LATER , a report circulates in our crowd . Andrew , a family friend , had stopped down at our beach house late one afternoon when Karen and Uwe were there . I do n't know why-to pick up a book he left behind , whatever . He checked out the sleeping arrangements . His report : separate beds . Karen and Uwe were not , in fact , sleeping together . Jesus , I think , what is everyone 's problem with- ? I stop , remember my own anxiety . But those last three days I was alone with my boys , I thought it through , and I finally decided how I really feel : Uwe is important to Karen . Okay , I accept that . I do n't have to be his buddy . But it 's not his fault . I do n't dislike him . I know he is a wonderful guy because Karen thinks so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her friend , she was refreshed , happy , somehow larger . And that was very nice . So this is my answer to everybody who thinks we 're playing with fire : Uwe is part of our life because my wife loves him . It 's right . There is no denying how someone feels . Which is why , when Karen tells me that next summer she 's going to Germany , I think , Good . I prefer it that way , on his turf , far away . Because there 's no denying how I feel , either . <p>
