<p> Peter S. Prichard , editor of USA TODAY <p> ... spent two weeks in eastern Europe with a group from the American Society of Newspaper Editors . He talked with leaders and the ordinary people who are trying to make the transition from totalitarian communist regimes to democracy and free-market economies . Here are some impressions from his tour : East Berlin : Secret files conceal old wounds <p> Wir sind ein Volk ! <p> We are one people ! <p> These proud words are emblazoned now on the walls of a gray , grim building here - the headquarters of the Stasi , the hated East German security police . <p> But there 's another message scrawled on this profoundly depressing building : Freiheit fur meine Akten - Freedom for my file . <p> Citizens who stormed the building in January found a mountain of reports on East German citizens . In a nation of 16 million , demonstrators said , police had reports on 6 million people . Laid on the ground , the files would stretch for 110 miles . <p> Opening the files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police , is complicated . <p> " We 're not planning on publishing the names of collaborators , " says Klaus Wendler , a citizens committee leader . <p> A typical report names 30 to 50 people who informed on a suspected dissident . " Even his wife , even his closest friends " are listed as snitches , Wendler says . <p> " One person reading his file might understand this background and do nothing , " says Wendler . " Another guy might kill his wife . " <p> Wendler says that perhaps 20% of the East German population worked for or helped the Stasi . <p> What to do with the ex-communists , from bureaucrats to informers , is a problem in most Eastern European countries . In many cases , the ex- apparatchiks are the only people with the knowledge to run electrical plants , purify water , operate transit systems . Many are still working . <p> Arpad Goncz , new president of Hungary , who spent six years in jail after the 1956 uprising , says some ex-communists are " absolutely human . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spies , but they were blackmailed . <p> " If the records of collaborators now were released , a great many people could not live in security , " cautions Goncz . " Some lists will come out , but this is very , very dangerous for society . " <p> Stasi 's stark implication is painted on a wall outside : " This place stinks . " West Berlin : Unity , but still different <p> In the opulent 13th floor conference room of Deutsche Bank Berlin AG , where waiters have just poured white wine for visiting U.S. editors , a young banker is telling a joke . Milos Stefanovic heard it from a Hungarian official , who asked : " Do you know the difference between East Germany and Hungary ? " <p> " There are many differences , " Stefanovic replied . <p> " Yes , " the official said , " but the most important one is that there is no West Hungary . " <p> Indeed , to a traveler it appears the biggest nation-to-nation takeover in history is under way . West Germany is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . <p> In this transaction , the West Germans are the prosperous burghers doing 100 mph in the Autobahn 's speed lane , blowing past bewildered East Germans in their little Trabants with the lawnmower engines . <p> The former West Germans , who can now call themselves " we Germans , " are supremely confident they can deal with East Germany 's pollution and fading factories . <p> Kurt Kasch , Deutsche Bank Berlin 's managing director , says it could take eight years to bring the former East Germany - the former German Democratic Republic - up to the West German standard . " I am sure we will be successful . We are one of the booming industrial nations . If we ca n't restructure the GDR we can give up any hope of restructuring the rest of Eastern Europe . " Dresden : Invasion brings miracle car wax <p> Dresden , firebombed by the Allies in World War II , has been invaded by capitalists . Shiny Volkswagens are sold on vacant lots . Hotel parking lots are packed with Mercedes and BMWs from the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hotels , where casinos have already opened . <p> On the city 's main shopping street , the former East Germans cluster curiously around hawkers using microphones to pitch magic chopping knives , miracle auto polish , even turbans - just like late-night TV ads in the States . Budapest : Old rules confuse new markets <p> A young Hungarian bureaucrat struggles with the latest request . The Budapest sewage disposal company , still state-controlled , wants to know if 160 " public powder rooms " can now be considered a chain of retail stores , eligible to be privatized . <p> Or does the new privatization law mean this toilet chain is now controlled by the local Budapest government , which has just held elections ? Csaba Gelenyi 's agency has 30 days to decide . <p> Gelenyi notes that 90% of Hungarian companies are state-owned , and most of their accounting is unintelligible " for a Western-educated brain . For a Soviet , an Eastern European , ( the ledger ) is quite clear . " <p> Across Eastern Europe , nations are struggling to figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English acronym for state-owned enterprises . The issue is complicated because there is no banking infrastructure , the phones work poorly or not at all , and almost no one understands how a stock market operates . <p> Even so , the Hungarian Stock Exchange , with 22 employees , trades stocks for an hour a day and hopes to have 20 companies listed and trading when the securities law is finished . <p> Enre Aczel , a Hungarian newspaper editor , is pessimistic for the near- term : " It 's looking more and more miserable for a larger and larger part of the population . Living standards could be lowered by 40% or more . " Prague : News replacing Talking Heads <p> No one is going to concerts here . " People would rather stay home and watch the news , " says Michael Zantovsky , spokesman for President Vaclev Havel . <p> There 's so much music in the streets of this magical city , where the architecture looks like Disneyland , that it may not matter . Take a brief stroll and hear a brass ensemble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock band belting out the Beatles ' All You Need Is Love , and a little girl , perhaps 10 , playing We Three Kings on a wooden flute . <p> In the country where the president is a playwright , spokesman Zantovsky used to be a rock musician . And talks like one : " I had my Beatles period , my Talking Heads period , and of course , several Dylan periods , " says Zantovsky . <p> Zantovsky got to know Vaclev Havel well at " summer camp , " an idyllic meadow where Czech dissidents vacationed in southern Bohemia near a mental hospital . <p> The families had to walk through pine-studded hills to get there , and for some reason the secret police never followed . There were more than 40 kids , dogs , a lake , a stream . This summer , Havel and Zantovsky returned to the meadow for a reunion . They had to bring security guards , so it was n't the same . <p> Can Havel , the playwright , make the tough calls for the Czech and Slovak people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a steel core , " says Zantovsky , who knows a sound bite when he hears one . West Berlin : Soviets may need ' 500 years ' The conventional wisdom here is that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics will not survive . Economic conditions there are worse even than in Poland , where at least there is food in the stores , even if few Poles have enough Zlotys to buy much . <p> David Anderson , the former U.S. ambassador to Yugoslavia who heads the Aspen Institute in Berlin , says the Russians are joking that Gorbachev has a " 500-year " economic plan , not a " 500-day " one . And when Gorbachev received the Nobel Peace Prize , a visiting Soviet joked to Anderson , " He should have won it for economics . " <p> Dr. Horst Klinkmann , a physician who headed the East German Academy of Sciences , spoke with Gorbachev this month in Moscow . Klinkmann says Gorbachev is under great strain : " Looking at him as a physician , you can see how this man is worn out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears the Soviets are locked in " a downward spiral toward a subsistence economy . The local currency is n't worth anything , you ca n't exchange it for anything . You turn to bottles of whiskey and cartons of cigarettes . It 's a recipe for social unrest and angry nationalism . <p> " The Russians are thinking about giving up the U.S.S.R. , " says Anderson . " Some Russians feel they 'd be better off if they just let the republics go . When I ask them where they will be then , they say , ' Oh , we 'll be in Moscow . ' " North of Prague : Pollution now the threat <p> The trees are gone from these pretty mountains . Acid rain , generated from the emissions from many chemical plants and the ubiquitous brown coal that is burned here , has killed them . <p> Physicians are paid special bonuses to work in this region . Children are sent away for three-week breaks to breathe cleaner air . The cancer rate is high . <p> " No one likes to come here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the bus passes a fertilizer plant spewing poisons into the air . " People do n't like to eat fruit from the area . <p> " There used to be great forests here , now there are bare hills . It is like Moonland . " <p> Reading up on Eastern Europe 's pollution does n't properly prepare a visitor . The air is brown , hazy . Even in bright sunlight , visibility is sharply reduced . On winter mornings when more coal is burned , it 's common for people to wake up and wipe a thin layer of black dust off their faces . Veteran joggers cough after a mile or so . <p> To escape the pollution , people from Prague leave the city on weekends to visit small country houses , many of them one or two rooms with gardens , and breathe better air . In Hungary , the Buda hills above the capital 's gray haze are called " the lungs of Budapest . " Prague : Czechs picked Oakland , too <p> Michael Horacek , a former journalist , has opened a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Czech republic and 20 in the Slovak republic . Last week he offered odds on the Miami-Notre Dame game , which could be seen via satellite in his parlors , and , of course , on the World Series . <p> " But Oakland is a prohibitive favorite , " said Horacek , proving he was as prescient as USA TODAY and just about everyone else . West Berlin : Women rule , but all remember <p> Ingrid Stahmer , the vice mayor of West Berlin , is the senior woman on a city council that has eight women and six men - perhaps the only major city in the world governed by a majority of women . <p> People thought having women in power would mean " doomsday , " Stahmer says , " but we proved it ( a female majority ) is quite workable . " What 's different about it ? " There 's a lot less posturing , much more talking to the facts , " Stahmer says . " Much more support , and less - how would you say it ? - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's morning caucuses were quickly dubbed " the witches ' breakfast . " <p> Everyone in Berlin remembers where they were the night the wall came down - Nov. 9 , 1989 - engraved in their minds as the assassination of JFK is for Americans . Klaus Landowsky , a mortgage banker and head of the Christian Democrats in Berlin , brought his teen-age daughter to watch the East Germans come across the wall : <p> " I never will forget this moment , " he says . " First they came quietly . Then I heard a cry , it was like in Japan when workers go on strike . The West Berliners gave East Berliners 10 or 20 deutsche marks and said , ' Buy you a beer . ' It was the most exciting moment of my political life . " <p> TEXT OF GRAPHIC WE ARE THE PEOPLE
