As tumult unfolds in the U.S.S.R. , it is good to remember an earlier &lt; upheaval of great moment . After years of oppression , thousands of angry and impatient Americans threw off the yoke of tyranny and declared themselves once and for all free  --  to fornicate . Thus began the youth revolution of the ' 60s and ' 70s . The battle cry was " Gim me an S ! . . . Gim me an E ! . . . Gim me an X ! , " though frequently the word in question was spelled differently  --  with four letters . So the rebels got plenty of sex , not to mention herpes . <P> But not all were ignorant or incautious . The smart ones had a textbook . It was The Joy of Sex , a 1972 how-to " gourmet guide , " written in breezy language by British physician Alex Comfort , who persuaded his readers that with a little imagination and a sense of adventure , lovemaking could be more fun than sex . Comfort was widely derided as a flaky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with the exactitude of a cookbook recipe . But he had it right : The Joy of Sex , witty , fanciful and mercifully free of moralizing , sold more than 8 million copies . <P> Now the sexual revolution is history . The rebels have kids of their own , and they must learn that sex in the age of AIDS is hazardous . That is reason enough for Comfort to publish a timely reconsideration  --  The New Joy of Sex : A Gourmet Guide to Lovemaking for the Nineties ( Crown ; $30 ) . Comfort 's message is that you can still have a lot of fun in bed , but you had better be careful . Casual coupling  --  one-night stands , sex with strangers , group sex , sex without adequate precautions  --  can be fatal . <P> Like the old Joy , the revised volume is illustrated with alarmingly explicit drawings , though these are newly done . In place of the hirsute hippie male ( de rigueur in the ' 70s ) and his female counterpart are an ordinary-looking beardless youth who might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be your lawyer . Gone too is the collection of superfluous erotic Japanese prints depicting contortions of improbable physicality ; in their place is a portfolio of " art " photos , which are at least fathomable . <P> What is significantly new about New Joy is a foreword : " The Implications of AIDS " ( which " totally alters the sexual landscape " ) and a revised , thoroughgoing chapter on health , which the reader ought to study and absorb before moving on to the rest of the text . In blunt fashion , Comfort describes the ways in which people can become infected with AIDS and discusses methods of avoidance ( none of which are without their dangers ) . Comfort 's keynote : / " If your newly found love wo n't use a condom , you are in bed with a witless , irresponsible and uncaring person . "
