<p> CBS almost has a no-lose proposition ; when it is n't fun watching the Winter Olympics , it 's fun complaining about the Winter Olympics . Carp as sports fans may , CBS 's really big snow show has become a smash success in the great American living room . <p> It might have done even better in the ratings , and our hearts , if CBS had stuck to its original plan , which was to have the anchoring from Albertville , France , done by stay-at-home superstar Connie Chung , a proven viewer favorite . <p> Chung , who earns a reported $ 2 million a year , has opted out of most of her CBS duties in recent months for the announced purpose of attempting to have a baby with husband and TV trashmonster Maury Povich . Sources within CBS differ over whether Chung was officially offered the Olympics gig and said no or whether she merely let it be known during prefatory talks that she was not interested . <p> Chung could not be reached yesterday . <p> Either because Chung is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the anchoring of the Games turned out to be not such a big job anyway . Paula Zahn , she of the Stepford Smile , and Tim McCarver , Mr. Does n't Have a Clue , have had very little screen time . Since the Games are almost entirely on tape , edited events spill out onto the air with few lulls or gaps , except of course for those inserted to pad out air time . <p> When a network pays $ 243 million for rights , as CBS did , it is naturally going to wring as much air time from the Games as possible , so as to sell as much commercial time as possible . The prime-time hours have been fairly tight with events , or at least with comparably compelling material , but fringe programming , late at night and in the early morning , has been mostly an Olympics of blabbing , mere talk shows built around Olympic themes . <p> During prime time , on the other hand , CBS seems to have much less superfluous chatterboxing than there was at ABC 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events aired live ) , or at NBC 's much- criticized Summer Olympics from Seoul later that year . <p> David F. Poltrack , the CBS executive vice president in charge of research , says all the complaints about Bryant Gumbel 's opinionated high profile at Seoul convinced CBS that " the events and drama are what make the Olympics , " not the star power in the anchor chairs . <p> Asked if the beguiling Chung nevertheless would n't have added a point or two to CBS 's nightly ratings , Poltrack said , " I do n't think any particular personality , in terms of the reporting team , would make a significant difference . " <p> Sports purists may grumble about the CBS variety-show approach , but it is exactly what the network intended : to make the prime-time Games an entertainment extravaganza , not a sports show . " We are maximizing the value of the Olympics , " Poltrack says . " This is the most meticulously planned broadcast I have seen in the 20 years I 've been at the network . " <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects " of the Olympics to attract a broad spectrum of viewers . It 's assumed sports fans will watch anyway . CBS also went after those attracted to what Poltrack calls the patriotic , human-interest and " shared experience " elements in the event . <p> Perhaps this is indeed what every network does when it has the Olympics , but on CBS the mix seems to be working smoothly and resulting in relatively few occasions when viewers might logically be justified in screaming bloody murder . Relatively few  --  but not none . <p> At their worst , the prime-time broadcasts do sometimes give one the feeling of watching not the Olympics but a TV show about the Olympics , a cold synthetic distillation that might have been cooked up in the same lab that hatched USA Today or some other bloodless wonder of modern times . <p> But then along come very fabulous pictures or a moment of magnetic drama and everything sort of snaps into shape again . The camera work has been nothing less than spectacular , be it a wide shot of a mountain or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' scores are announced . <p> It 's exciting , too , to watch stories whose outcomes are not depressingly predictable , which is why reality shows are now succeeding in prime time and partly why the Olympics seem so refreshing . When Midori Ito of Japan fell during her routine on Wednesday night , it was a heart broke ' round the world . Unfortunately , the emotional oomph of the moment was lost on twittily yammering commentator Scott Hamilton , who exclaimed , almost gleefully , " Definite .5 deduction ! " <p> What you needed was someone to say " Oh , poor kid " and offer a little consolation , someone to express what viewers were feeling at the moment . Verne Lundquist , the grown-up assigned to baby-sit Hamilton , did supply some of that , and has been doing a quietly distinguished job right along . Just being able to pronounce " Vyacheslav Zagorodniuk " is an impressive feat . <p> Zagorodniuk is a Russian skater who performed his routine to " Slaughter on Tenth Avenue , " by America 's Richard Rodgers . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skater who performed his routine to the " 1812 " Overture by Russia 's Peter I. Tchaikovsky . Ah , the sweet internationalism of it all ! While most of the book on Olympics coverage has been written by ABC Sports , CBS took a page from NBC for its Albertville marathon : the late-night show hosted by Pat O'Brien , patterned after a well-received NBC late-night show with popular Bob Costas from Seoul in 1988 . <p> Unfortunately , the O'Brien show is smothered in self-conscious cool and dippy hip . Viewers who missed events during the day or in prime time and expect to be filled in with handy recaps are out of luck . This show is simply one cute gimmick after another . <p> It has to be admitted , though , that the gimmickry is stylishly produced , with wizardly tape editing and dazzling montages . This is a show for sports fans who are primarily interested in the sport of television . <p> Poltrack says the ratings have been especially good for the Games considering the network viewer erosion that has occurred over the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Yugoslavia , were averaging an 18 rating when they reached the point at which the Albertville Games are now . That year , the average rating of a prime-time network TV program was 16.7 , so , Poltrack says , the Olympics were doing 8 percent better than regular fare . <p> In 1988 , ABC was averaging a 19.1 rating from Calgary at this point in the Games . But the average rating of a prime-time show had slipped to 14.4 . Now the Olympics were performing 33 percent better . <p> So far from Albertville , CBS has averaged a 19.2 rating . And the prime-time average has fallen to 12.5 . Thus Poltrack points with pride to a 54 percent improvement . " The relative value of these major sports events , particularly the Olympics , grows , " Poltrack says . <p> Too bad then , is n't it , that the Olympics may be pricing themselves beyond the networks ' reach . Frustrated by a lack of regulatory relief from the cable-coddling FCC , the networks may be forced to resist the next invitation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta . Poltrack says these will be especially pricey , since with America the host country , the winning network will have to bear additional pool-coverage costs . <p> For all the effort and all the money CBS has expended on Albertville , it now hopes either to break even or to make what one network executive calls " a little bit of money " on the Games . Of course , even this is better than the loss that had been predicted for months . <p> We face the discomforting specter of an entire future Olympics being restricted to pay-per-view cable TV ( parts of this summer 's Barcelona Games will be hawked that way ) , with networks already having predicted that national events like the World Series and the Super Bowl and the Oscars could face a similar exile . <p> The FCC does n't care , so do n't bother appealing to them . <p> For now , the Games from Albertville have revitalized the TV season and also revitalized once-sleepy Team CBS , proving that great , and relatively glitchless , television can still be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget cuts . <p> On Wednesday night , Charles Kuralt , windy but invaluable old network news hound , did an eight-minute piece on a French mountain village where U.S. Marines had been hidden during World War II after parachuting into the occupied country . The commander , Peter Ortiz , finally surrendered , in August 1944 , on the condition that the Germans spare the buildings and people of the town . They did . Kuralt was trying to prompt some tears with the tale , and it worked . <p> Thanks to touches like that , the Winter Olympics have been more than Winter Olympics . They 've been a European vacation . The Games end with closing ceremonies Sunday night . It 'll be hard to come home .
