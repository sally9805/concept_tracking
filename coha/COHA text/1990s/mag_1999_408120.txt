In the Gutsiest Tour de France Ever , America 's Hero Saves More Than HIs Own Life Photograph Photograph Photograph TOP : Lance pulls Virenque ( front ) , Zulle and Escartin ( two rear riders ) in the pivotal ninth stage .

TEAM SHOT ( left to right ) : George Hincapie , Lance , Christian Vande Velde , Tyler Hamilton . // When he sees the two of them just up the mountain road and realizes he will catch them , some thought must go through his head , but it is lost to us . In the movie of Lance Armstrong 's life there will be a flashback at this point : Maybe a doctor , white jacket in a white room , 1996 , somber and authoritative , telling him he has a 20 to 50 percent chance to live . Or maybe a hospital room-his hospital room-filling with suits from the French racing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his contract after publicly declaring their support for the cancer  --  stricken former world champion . Or that day after chemo when his hair came back and he ran over to make his neighbor feel the sprouted fuzz . Or that first shaky bike ride . But those are movie scenes , and the actual thought or memory that fired through Lance Armstrong 's brain when he caught Ivan Gotti and Fernando Escartin on the final climb of stage nine of this year 's Tour de France has been lost somewhere in the Today Show , CBS This Morning , David Letterman , the Nike commercials ( and flight home on the chartered Nike jet ) , the press conference in Manhattan , the victory party in Paris , the front pages of the New York Times and USA Today , the reported $400,000 book deal . If Lance himself remembers just what he thought at the most pivotal moment in American road cycling in at least a decade , he 's retold it so many times the meaning and the reality have overlapped . Here is what we can know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wearer of the yellow jersey , accelerated as smoothly as any great rider ever has and nosed his front wheel between Gotti and Escartin . We know that Gotti , this year 's winner of the mountainous Giro d'Italia , and Escartin , one of best climbers in the world , had counted on cracking Armstrong in this stage , taking the yellow jersey away from the brash and miraculous American . We know that they were surprised to see him , because the shock shows clearly on their faces in the TV footage shot from the motorcycle laboring beside them up the ascent . We know that another racer , one probably more dangerous to Armstrong 's lead than either Gotti or Escartin-Alex Zulle-had been chasing just seconds behind Armstrong and also caught the now three-man lead group . And we know that just after Zulle joined the group , slightly more than three miles from the finish of the first mountain stage of the 23-day , 2,306-mile Tour de France-the stage where the climbers were supposed to crack Armstrong but instead fell apart themselves-we know that Armstrong jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and 20 or 30 yards up the road America 's new hero looked back at the blown riders in amazement . When the team car pulled up beside him , Armstrong looked over and said : " How do you like them #$ ! % ! @ ! apples ? " How do we like them apples ? Suddenly we have H apples to like . We have a phrase to trade with each other as we climb . We have a new rider we can pretend to be ( even those of us who wo n't admit to such games ) . We have Lance Armstrong . Again . Better than ever . He 's always ridden with fire and #$ ! % ! @ ! - apples drama . In ' 91 , riding for the U.S. national team in an 11-day stage race in Italy , a surging Armstrong was asked by the coach to hold back so another , more popular pro rider on the mixed pro-am team could win . He refused , and won the race even though fans littered the road with tacks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his very first race , the Classica San Sebastian in Spain , he finished 111th-dead last . He was expected to quit . " I was 30 minutes off the back and it was pissing rain , " he says . " It was raining so hard it hurt . But I had to finish . I did n't do it to impress anyone . Just to finish . That night , my teammates said they realized I was n't normal . " Photograph Whether it 's cancer or climbs : " Whatever it takes to win . " // In ' 93 , Armstrong earned a $1 million bonus for winning all three races in the Thrift Drug Triple Crown . The final victory of the trio , which also gave him the stars-and-stripes jersey of the U.S. road champion , came after Armstrong set himself free from the peloton with a ferocious attack on the course 's steepest climb . " I 'm on the bike and I go into a rage , " Armstrong said afterward . " I shriek for about five seconds , I shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd never quit . That 's heart . That 's soul . That 's guts . " In the ' 95 Tour de France , two days after his teammate and friend Fabio Casartelli died in a SO-mph-plus downhill crash , Armstrong broke away to a solo , emotional victory , raising his hands and closed eyes to the sky as he crossed under the finish banner . Then in ' 96 , at the end of the season , ranked seventh-best in the world and signed to a new , $2.5-million contract with Cofidis for ' 97 , he coughed up blood . On October 8 , 1996 , Armstrong held a press conference to announce that he had choriocarcinoma , a rare and particularly lethal form of testicular cancer . The next day he had surgery to remove the malignant testicle . Doctors discovered that the cancer had spread to his lungs and abdomen . Five days later he began a 12-week course of chemotherapy . There were 8-10 golf-ball-sized lumps of cancer in his lungs . Armstrong , focused on a goal beyond mere survival , opted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly increase his chance of being able to race again . " The side effects from the original drug could have potentially prohibited me from racing again because of insufficient lung capacity , " he says matter-of-factly . " So we switched . " After the second week of chemotherapy , an MRI showed that the cancer had migrated to his brain . Armstrong went into six hours of surgery . Chemo drugs were pumped into him four hours every day ; the other 20 he was hooked to IV bags to counteract the toxic side effects . But he was in familiar territory . In a race . Against lots of enemies . Photograph // " Cancer is smart , " he said at the time . " It 's aggressive . It has tactics it can change and ways it can resist . When I raced , I said , Whatever it takes to win . ' Well , this whole thing is just that : Whatever it takes . " In November , Armstrong was lying in a hospital bed in Indianapolis when he was invited to attend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A spectator . He accepted the invitation  --  but only if he could ride , which he did , cruising the 26-mile course beside Eddy Merckx ( who 'd come to America to visit what he assumed would be a hospital  --  bedridden Armstrong ) in 1:22 . The next day , he found out that the protein markers that measured the strength of his cancer had dropped from a high of 100,000 to 113 . By February , X-rays and blood work showed no cancer in his body . By October ' 97  --  slightly more than a year after he was diagnosed with cancer , Armstrong was back on his bike , training through rain and cold mornings . " Lance is Lance , " explains his teammate and friend Frankie Andreau . " He 's not like everyone else . " He 's never been like anyone else . " Lance is one in a million , " says Edward Coyle , Ph.D. , who ran physiological tests on Armstrong at the University of Texas Human Performance Lab . " Maybe one in 10 million . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only one-fourth that of his competitors . " Even so , Armstrong was never a great Tour rider . Although he 'd won two stages before this year , he 'd only finished one of the four Tours he 'd entered . Among other things , the 170-pound swimmer 's build that stayed on his 5foot-10 frame from his teenage triathlete days had always hurt him in the mountains . He weighed 158 when he began this year 's Tour de France . The USPS team director , former Tour racer Johan Bruyneel , believed Armstrong could win . The plan was to do well in the prologue time trial and stay close to the leaders in the early flat stages , then take the yellow jersey in the first time trial ( stage 8 ) and try to defend it through the Alps and Pyrenees . Armstrong won the prologue on July 4 , smashing the course record of five  --  time Tour champion Miguel Indurain . " I really wanted to take the yellow jersey .... That 's cool ! It makes up for not being back home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying loose despite the pressure of the leader 's jersey . After last year 's performance-enhancing drug controversy  --  several top riders and teams either abandoned or were kicked out of the Tour-Armstrong 's victory was the feelgood moment racing fans craved . And , some experts thought , which the Tour needed to survive . " We 've got to fall back in love with cycling , " Armstrong said . " And we should start now . " As expected , he surrendered the yellow jersey in stage two , to Estonian sprinter Jan Kirsipuu of Casino . Kirsipuu would be the only other racer to wear yellow . Armstrong snatched the maillot jaune back in the stage 8 time trial , beating top contender Zulle by 56 seconds and world time trial champion Abraham Olano by 2:22 . ( American Bobby Julich , who finished third in the Tour last year and was expected to contend for the overall title , crashed out of the race on a descent . ) It was an impressive trouncing , an amazing comeback . But none of it had happened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Escartin , Gotti , Richard Virenque ( winner of four King-of-the  --  Mountain polka-dot jerseys ) and other climbers waited for stage 9:132 miles up ; six climbs , including a mountaintop finish ; two category-one mountains ( the hardest numerical rating ) and another so difficult it is labeled " hors categorie , " or " above category . " At the morning 's press conference , Armstrong indicated he would ride strategically to defend the yellow jersey-race not for stage wins but to conserve energy so as not to lose too much time or become exhausted in any one stage . It was a smart answer . An expected answer . And completely wrong . As the stage unreeled , Escartin 's Kelme teammates launched attacks that shattered the field and separated Armstrong from his teammates , leaving him alone with a pack of seven climbing specialists . At the base of the final , seven  --  mile climb , Gotti and Escartin attacked , building a 32-second lead over Armstrong and the rest of the group . The move was not a time threat to Armstrong 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he attacked , caught the astonished pair and then motored away once more when Zulle bridged . Armstrong crossed the finish line in a cold rain , looking skyward as he once had for Fabio Casartelli . Old-time race fans like to say that " You can see Paris from the last climb in the Tour . " This was only the first climb , but Armstrong had proven himself . If he did n't say it , he could see Paris . And Paris could see him . " The Armstrong that won in Metz and in Sestrieres was untouchable , " said La Gazzetta newspaper . " The comeback of the century , " said the authoritative French sports daily L'Equipe . Foreign fans wrote his name across the roads , waved American flags . Everyone knew someone who 'd had cancer . Every fan had been crushed by last year 's debacle . Not all newspapers were enthusiastic . One claimed that traces of steroids had been detected in Armstrong 's urine after stage one . The substance turned out to be an ointment used to treat a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the 12 days after Sestrieres , Armstrong would defend his lead across 25 more mountains . He would dominate the fastest Tour ever ( an average speed of 24.9 mph ) , and the first one won by an American riding on an American team and an American bike . He would be more than seven minutes ahead of second-place Zulle and more than 10 ahead of third-place Escartin . He would win the final time trial , joining Indurain , Bernard Hinault and Eddy Merckx as the only racers to ever win all the time trials in a Tour . At the finish in Paris , he would say , " I 'm in shock . I 'm in shock . I 'm in shock . I would just like to say one thing : If you ever get a second chance in life for something , go all the way . " At the victory dinner his teammates would salute him with raised hands , each of them holding an apple . Those apples would be for him . Tributes . But who were " them apples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could guess they were consolation prizes for Gotti , Escartin and Zulle . Or retribution for the teams that would n't have him , or the skeptical European media . Or maybe they were simply some kind of amazement he needed to share-the pure , uncontainable elation of being Lance Armstrong , hero , bike racer , savior first of your own life , and then of something more . <p>
