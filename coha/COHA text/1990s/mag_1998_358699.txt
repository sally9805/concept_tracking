Leo , Leo , Leo  --  I 'm so sick of that Leo DiCaprio . Bad enough he 's on the cover of every teen magazine on the planet . Now he 's invaded my home page  --  and my home . Ever since Titanic set sail , " DiCaprio " has been the most searched-for word on Pathfinder , Time Inc. ' s website , relegating the Coke and Pepsi of the search-word business  --  " sex " and " Bill Gates "  --  to also-rans . Leo searches are especially frenzied from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m . Schoolgirls coming home , I figure , as the sweet spot of the time zone rolls west . <P> All this looking for Leo would be O.K. if I could escape him at Casa Quittner . But I ca n't . My daughters walk around with their noses buried in Leo biographies . They slather their walls with his glossies , making their bedrooms look like preteen minimum-security prison cells . Worse , they know he 's out there on the Web somewhere , everywhere , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I was online the other night , a daughter on each knee , trying to avoid the king of Leo sites ,
