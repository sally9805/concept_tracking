How to get alternative fuel cars on the road . Lots of them . Right now . <p> For years I had been substance-dependent , and it was time to get out . The stuff had always made life easier  --  until the after effects kicked in . As friends warned me it would , it was starting to ruin my health . Sure , it was relatively cheap , but I could no longer dodge the fact that kids were dying so foreign cartels could feed my habit . I had to do something . Oil was ruining my life . <p> What I got my hands on was one answer to U.S. petroleum dependence  --  natural gas , a fuel that 's cheap , clean , and domestically abundant see " Energy Without Emirs , " October 1990 . There I was , wind in my hair , tiger in my tank , driving a standard full-size Chrysler and enjoying as smooth a ride as Lee Iacocca ever promised . The only thing missing was the gasoline . <p> Any serious discussion of breaking our petroleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 million of the 18 million barrels we use daily , and most of that goes into cars , trucks , and buses . Transportation is 97 percent oil-dependent , while electricity generation is only 5 percent . Although oil use for purposes besides transportation has dropped 20 percent since the mid-seventies , vehicles have boosted their demand by about the same amount . As a result , we 're back to the oil consumption peak of 1976 , with less crude in the ground and little hope for stability in the major oil-rich countries . But we have the tools to get the oil-monkey off our backs  --  if only we 'd choose to use them . <p> Of the contenders to replace oil , compressed natural gas and electricity are the most immediately promising . Both are cleaner than gasoline . Both are available now , without pie-in-the-sky technological advances . Neither poses the national security problems of petroleum . And when environmental effects are counted , both cost less . The trick is to identify the transportation niche that each can fill and then gradually begin displacing gasoline-powered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural gas , for instance , is fleet vehicles  --  which consume 20 percent of our road transportation energy . That 's about as much oil as we import from the Persian Gulf . <p> It was a bit of a letdown when I finally got to drive an automobile powered by natural gas . Out on the open road , I flipped a switch on the dash to go from gasoline to compressed natural gas ( CNG ) and .. , nothing happened . An instant 's hesitation , and then the Chrysler drove as it had before . Or so it seemed . In fact , from the planet 's perspective , the situation had changed radically . After all , the smog-producing components of my exhaust had suddenly dropped 80 percent . <p> Natural gas vehicles ( NGVs ) not only contribute a lot less to local smog than do gasoline or diesel vehicles , they also emit 25 percent less carbon dioxide , which means less risk of global warming . Because the fuel is so much cleaner than gasoline , vehicles running on it require less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fantasy fuel ; some 750,000 NGVs are already on the road , and doing quite nicely . Unfortunately , only 30,000 of them are in the U.S.  --  about one car in 6,000 . Canada , with one-tenth of our population , has an NGV fleet two-thirds as large . Australia and Italy have 50 times as many NGVs per capita ; New Zealand 's proportion is 320 times as high as the U.S. 's . Those countries have n't wrecked their economies or deprived their citizens of the inalienable right to the thrill of the open road . With the help of NGVs , cleaning up the air and protecting the beaches , reducing the risk of global warming and keeping troops out of the Middle East can be achieved without drastically changing your life . <p> The fuel itself is 30 to 50 percent cheaper than gasoline , and likely to stay that way for at least a few more automobile lifetimes . Like the Chrysler I drove , nearly all NGVs now on the road have modified ( " dual-fuel " ) gasoline engines . Adding compressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is done on a small custom scale . ( The NGV I drove is owned by Washington Gas , which had to send the car to West Virginia for conversion . ) In a typical family car , money saved on fuel could take eight years to pay for the retrofit . This is n't likely to be a big hit with the average consumer , although reduced maintenance costs would sweeten the deal . But several technologies now in development will improve the picture for NGVs . A " dedicated CNG engine " will get higher efficiency and performance by taking advantage of the 135 octane rating of natural gas . This higher efficiency will help close the gap in driving range between NGVs and conventional cars  --  CNG currently requires four times the fuel-storage volume as gasoline . Better fuel tanks should reduce weight and increase range . <p> You may agree that the warm feeling of doing a little extra for national security and the environment would more than balance any small differences in cost and convenience . But before you rush into anything , let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100-odd miles down the road . Have you ever seen a CNG filling station ? <p> I have personally visited one-third of all the supposedly public CNG pumps in America : at the Amoco station at 9th and Pennsylvania in Southeast D.C. ( the other two are in Colorado ) . The pump is a simple white box sporting Amoco 's green-leaf CNG logo and two thin hoses . Because of an archaic utility regulation prohibiting resale , this D.C. outlet , which is n't yet operational , wo n't even be able to sell natural gas to the public . But surely the scarcity problem is fixable . When personal computers came out , there were n't too many stores where you could buy floppy disks , either . That did n't mean we should have given up on PCs . The ABCs of NGVs <p> Converting to natural gas vehicles poses a chicken-and-egg dilemma . Detroit would be willing to optimize an NGV if there were a solid market for it , and mass production would eliminate the high cost of retrofits . Buyers would be attracted to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And gas station owners would install CNG compressors if there were enough demand to make that investment profitable . But no one will make the first move . <p> The key to breaking this gridlock is to begin with cars that travel local routes and can be centrally fueled . " Fleet vehicle , " the catch-all category , includes buses , delivery vans , garbage trucks , taxicabs , even rental cars  --  in all , about 10 percent of American vehicles . These vehicles consume some 20 percent of road transportation energy , because they log double the annual mileage of the average family car ( which means that retrofits will pay off twice as quickly ) . The conversion sequence could work like this : Start with government-owned or - operated cars , buses , and trucks that run on regular schedules . Put inexpensive overnight-fill compressors at their central parking lots . ( Off-hours fueling makes better use of gas pipelines , too , by leveling out demand . ) In Texas , one-third of new transit and private fleet purchases in metropolitan areas must be alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 50 percent in 1996 , and 90 percent by 1998 . The more cities that follow Texas 's model , the cheaper conversion will be for all . Convert private fleets of company cars , delivery vans , and taxis . ( Imagine what this could do for New York City 's air quality . ) Switch longer-range government vehicles to natural gas . Convert most rental cars to natural gas . Customers who rent for local use could get discounts for renting NGVs . After all , the majority of clients at National , Hertz , and Avis are businessmen who tend to use their cars only to get around town ( a National employee in D.C. estimated that the average businessman puts only 20 miles on the odometer ) . And because 85 percent of all rentals are dropped off where they were picked up , many rental sites could be easily converted to centralized compressed gas fueling . <p> By step four , there 'd be enough demand to support some private filling stations in big cities , and automakers would be producing engines to take advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NGVs would then become compelling to commuters , especially if air regulations cracked down on traditional fuels at the same time . Once this snowball effect gets big enough , perhaps Americans will be able to drive coast-to-coast in natural gas vehicles .. , which means we 'd finally catch up to the Canadians , who already can . Silent running <p> While we 're waiting for these natural gas filling stations to sprout up , we can begin switching to electric vehicles ( EVs ) . EVs are quiet , rechargeable virtually anywhere , and clean . Even when you take into account the emissions caused by making the electricity they use , EVs contribute less to local smog than gasoline-powered cars . Using coal-fired power , they produce slightly more carbon dioxide , but 90 percent less when they use nuclear , and 100 percent less with renewable energy . Think about it : streets full of softly humming vehicles , not a tailpipe in sight . <p> An EV drives pretty much like any other car , except that the brakes feel odd . That 's because when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a generator , pumping energy back into the batteries instead of dumping it overboard as waste heat . When the motor is not needed to push the car ( at a stoplight , for instance ) , it simply shuts off like a light . For environmental reasons , this feature makes EVs more attractive in traffic-congested areas . They 'd be a godsend in Southern California , where some 20 percent of gasoline is burned in cars stuck in traffic , getting zero miles per gallon . <p> By plugging an on-board charger into a socket at home , you could juice up your EV overnight for about half the cost of the gasoline it would take to drive as far . But although EVs have been around for a century , they are still rare creatures , numbering less than 10,000 worldwide . Why ? Probably because their range stinks : I recently drove an electric " G-Van " owned by Southern California Edison  --  a smooth and quiet ride , but the van could go only 60 miles before it needed to recharge for several hours . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statistics , this problem starts to shrink . We all know two-car families  --  in fact , there are about 40 million U.S. households , and more every year , with two or more cars . Clearly , in many of these households  --  more common sense  --  the family tends to rely on one car for trips around town , another for trips on the open road . Now consider this fact : The average commute to work by car  --  round-trip  --  is only 10 miles . And it takes place at an average speed of 31 mph . For that trip , you do n't exactly need the Batmobile . <p> EVs can also be used commercially . Although the G-Van is simply a low-tech variant of a vehicle built to run on oil  --  the gasoline engine , transmission , exhaust system , and radiator have been stripped out and replaced with one ton of batteries and an electric motor  --  it is ideal for predictable , short-haul urban driving . The electric van would cost about five percent less to own and operate than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric delivery vans for years , and why electric trucks are hauling trash in , of all places , Saudi Arabia . <p> Put one EV in each multi-car family , throw in all those short-range fleet cars and vans , and you 're talking about a hefty slice of the market . In fact , General Motors is aiming to have a marketable EV on the road by mid-decade . With the help of Paul MacCready , the American Society of Mechanical Engineers ' " Engineer of the Century , " GM has already built a prototype high-performance electric sportscar , regrettably called " Impact . " The Impact has a top speed of 110 mph and a range of 120 miles . GM is currently touting Impact research in television spots . Through more aerodynamic designs , higher pressure tires , and an improved power train , MacCready thinks we can double auto energy efficiency without loss of safety or performance . Improved efficiency not only cuts oil demand directly , but it also strengthens the case for lower-density alternatives like EVs by easing the problems of energy storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war in the Gulf , the Bush energy strategy should include more than just lobbying for oil pumping in environmentally sensitive areas . That sort of pumping will meet one year of national demand at best , while leaving the U.S. with less in reserve for the next crisis . If , as Bush suggested it would in his State of the Union Address , the administration focuses in the next year on the need for a credible energy policy , here are some more imaginative steps it might consider : <p> Consumer Information : as in labeling , for example . If we can require labels on cigarette packs and beer bottles , we can certainly do so on automobiles . Sure , we have EPA mileage ratings , but they run 15 percent higher than reality , and they are n't much use in buying decisions . A smarter system would put a statement on each sticker such as : " This car will cost about $W per year to own and operate . " To better inform more conscientious consumers , the label might add , " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment . " A lot of us would discover that driving can be much cheaper than it is now  --  and guilt-free at the same time . <p> Get Fuel Prices Right : Until the price of each commodity reflects the side effects of its use , we wo n't get the full benefits of a free market . Since our troops are presumably not dying to protect OPEC 's right to overcharge us for oil , let 's assume that when the war ends , oil will finally trade at its market price . All energy sources should then be taxed in proportion to the costs they impose on society through pollution , resource depletion , and security risks . Estimates of these costs do n't have to be perfect to be better than what we use now . <p> Reward as well as Penalize Automakers : A sliding scale of tough penalties on dirty gas guzzlers balanced by rebates for the leanest and cleanest would tell Detroit and Japan what to do . We can then it them figure out how to do it . <p> Support Efficiency and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early eighties are yielding thousands of dollars in direct energy savings for each research dollar spent . In the long run , putting money into efficiency R &D; will do as much to protect and improve the American way of life as investing in more Patriot missiles . <p> " We are doing everything we can to guarantee that there will be an adequate supply of hydrocarbons , " declared George Bush during the early days of the Gulf crisis  --  in retrospect , perhaps the most chilling comment on American preparations for war . Once the dust settles in the desert , maybe Americans will realize that there are better ways to get their hydrocarbons than by fighting for them , and that there are better ways to get to work in the morning than by driving a gas guzzler . Oil may have helped make the United States great , but it 's time to start letting go . <p> by Peter Gray <p> <p> Peter Gray is an economist at the Environmental Law Institute . <p>             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
