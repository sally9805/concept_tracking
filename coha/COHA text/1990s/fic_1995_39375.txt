I was driving truck for Friedman Transfer when Rachel sold her baby . It 's funny what you remember . The things that stay and the things that fade . What I remember most is our trailer . The way the wind whanged it around . The way the rain poured in , turning the paneling into wet cardboard , the rug into oatmeal . That place was a joke . It was a bad time . A bad time all around . <p> The only freight Friedman carried was a daily newspaper that came out at two-thirty or so . The exact time depended on how many blow-ins there were that day . Store ads , sheets of coupons , that kind of stuff . We 'd get to work at twelve , in case of an early press run , and play Tri-Ominos until we got the call . It passed the time and kept us out of fights . Then we 'd load up and locate our bundle boys , a bunch of dropouts who spent every free minute behind the building smoking dope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving up for a Fender Stratocaster . Sometimes , on the road , I 'd look back into the box and see him playing air guitar like he was on MTV . He was so into it he always tossed off the bundles at the wrong corners . Those poor carriers never knew where they 'd find their papers . <p> We were paid for four hours ' work , even though we only worked two , and the four-hour pay was more than most got for eight . It was a lazy man 's job , a good job . <p> Things started to go bad when the pressmen at the newspaper went out on strike . They were losing their jobs to automation , so who could blame them ? But we drivers decided not to sympathy strike , because the pressmen did n't support us last time we went out . Nobody remembered that , though , so the whole town turned against us . Guys waited for us at the drop-off points . Sammy 'd pitch out a bundle of papers , they 'd pitch it right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'd cuss us out . Most of them were Polish . When somebody swears at you in a language you do n't understand , it does things to your head . <p> They were a strange bunch , those Poles . Most of them were retired miners . Esther is a coal town at the foot of the Poconos . About twenty years ago , the river broke through the roof of a tunnel here . At the mouth of the cave-in there was a whirlpool wide as a city block . So big , the coal company ran a line of boxcars into it to stop it up , but they were sucked underground without a trace . The river kept pouring in until every shaft and tunnel under the valley was flooded . <p> That killed coal in Esther , but the Poles stayed on . No real jobs . No money . The ground cracking open under your house and no insurance to cover it . They stayed anyway . Everything that ever meant anything to them was underground , flooded , out of reach , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy . They lived and died by the union , and in the end , not even that could save them . Maybe they saw the strike as a way to get something back . Still , I ca n't feature it . <p> I was never much of a drinker , but every week the strike violence was getting worse , so I started stopping by this southside bar after work , just to settle my nerves . <p> That 's where I met Rachel , at Donahue 's Hour Glass . She was a licensed practical nurse . Thin blond hair and a bony face . Bony but attractive . After a while I was seeing her there every afternoon . We 'd talk . We 'd drink . We 'd eat a little bar food . We were together so much the regulars treated us like a couple , which I guess was OK with me . <p> Rachel and I got to know each other through the things we hated . " Whining and dining , " we called it . As soon as we sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old people she took care of in the nursing home , but some of them were zombies . They 're the ones I wanted to hear about . The one that called her " Mama . " The one that spent the night in the john because he could n't find the door . <p> I 'd tell her the latest strike stuff . How somebody sprayed " Scabs " on the door of the truck barn and punctured all the tires . The newspaper set up round-the-clock security . Big guys with dogs and guns and axe handles . I do n't know who scared me more . <p> One night , two weeks after we met , after the last last call , Rachel put down her drink and said , " Well ? What about it ? " We were both of us at that point where you think all the hard questions can only be settled in the dark , with your clothes off . " Yeah , " I said hoarsely . " I 'd like that . I 'd like that a lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we left her Volkswagen in the parking lot . When we pulled away in my screechy Impala , I said , " I think my ball joints are shot . " She looked at me funny and said , " We 'll see . We 'll see . " I liked her for that . <p> She told me she lived in the country . Some joke . She lived in <p> trailer park on the edge of town . In an empty cornfield across the highway was some kind of hobo village  --  pickups with homemade plywood campers built on the back , beat-up motor homes . <p> " Gypsies , " she said when she saw me staring . " Sometimes I go ova , have a cup of coffee , shoot the shit . They 're all right . The queen 's in the hospital here . They 're waiting for her to die . " <p> I saw a school bus with bubble windows . On top was a sundeck with a picket fence . Inside there were flickering lights and the shadows of people dancing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I saw in Rachel 's trailer was a crib in the corner of the living room , a lump under the blanket . She turned back the cover a little and I could see this sleeping baby  --  the chubby cheeks , the high round forehead , the pouty lips . <p> I said , " Is it yours ? " <p> " No , " she whispered , her eyes going wide . " I got her with boxtops . What do you think ? " She said her name was Trish . We stood there for a few seconds watching her sleep , her little hands curled up like flowers . <p> Rachel led me to the sofa . At first we sat there like strangers . Then she got up and poured us a couple of bourbons . Neither one of us knew how to talk without a drink in our hands . <p> She said , " Technically , I guess I 'm still a married woman . A little after Trish was born , my old man came home all pumped up about the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he could installing car stereos . " She shook her head and sipped her drink . There were dark smudges under her eyes . It was late . Her voice was low because of the baby . <p> " For a week I did nothing but get him ready to go . I cleaned and ironed all his clothes , bought him new underwear , new socks . And all the while he 's telling me about his plans  --  how he 's going to make sergeant , how we 're going to raise Trish in a big house on the base , and this , this , this . Before he got on the bus he said , ' What if I ca n't cut it at boot camp ? ' It was like he was all of a sudden my kid . I said , ' You 're tough , Lenny , and you 're smart . You 'll do fine . ' When I kissed him goodbye , the tears came shooting out of my eyes . " <p> Now I saw that all our stories about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the stories that really mattered . I sat there holding tight to that jelly glass of bourbon , listening as hard as I could . <p> She said , " When I did n't hear from him for a month , I called Fort Bragg , where he went for basic , but they said they never heard of him . The recruiting office in town told me he never even enlisted . " She shook her head . She sat there looking into her glass like something dead was floating around in there . She said , " Can you believe it ? " She looked up at me . " Have you ever in all your life heard anything so stupid ? " I could n't tell if she meant what Lenny did or how she believed him . <p> I said , " My dad was in the service . " I did n't know what else to say . I touched her arm with my thumb , the soft skin inside her elbow . " You 're better off without the guy . The service turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on leave and bat me around just for the hell of it . " I showed her the little finger of my left hand . He broke it so many times when I was a kid , it 's shorter than the other one and hooked away from the hand a little . I ca n't even bend it . She leaned over and kissed the finger , then my open palm . Light , quick kisses , but they gave me the chills . I kissed her hair . It smelled of shampoo and cigarettes . Then our mouths were all over each other and we stopped talking . <p> I pretty much moved in that night . Partly because I felt sorry for her . Partly because I was living in a moldy basement efficiency with one plate , one cup , one spoon . But mainly just because she made me feel good . It was like we saw the world with the same eyes . <p> And I liked Trish . She was n't even a year old , too little to know what to make of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I danced around the room with her up against my shoulder . We danced to Elvis , Buddy Holly . The classics . Every once in a while she 'd rear back her wobbly head and look at me like I was a talking dog . She made me laugh out loud . She was a good baby . <p> I do n't know why I did n't carry on like that when Rachel was around . I think it was the way she looked at the baby . She loved her and all , but it was like she could n't look at her without thinking of Lenny , what he did to her . <p> Things were fine for a couple months . During the days , while we were at work or at the Hour Glass , one of the gypsy women came and sat with Trish , an old woman named Andrea who had a big cracked mouth and gray hair that hung way down her back . Their queen was taking a long time to die , and a lot of the gypsies were desperate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter came on , the strike turned ugly . One day I was creeping my truck up a narrow , winding street . Esther is nothing but hills . Not a level spot anywhere . On streets like that , fourth gear is a fantasy . You hardly even see third . No real clearance . Those streets were made for donkey carts , not twenty-four-foot panel trucks . It 's first gear all the way , which is strange . On most trucks , you never touch first . But not in Esther . If you meet somebody head-on , one of you has to back up to the last intersection and let the other one pass . You have to take the turns in installments . That job gave me a round tailbone and an ulcer . <p> When I looked up to check for traffic , a guy was standing in the street ahead of me , an old man in green work pants , a big man with a face like a fist . Before I knew what was happening , he threw a rock at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut up . It happened so fast I did n't even have time to take my hands off the wheel . <p> " You scob ! " the man yelled , waving his fist at me . " You go straight from stinking hell , you scob ! " <p> A few weeks after that , Rachel lost her job . The state was phasing out the L.P.N. , so the nursing home had to let her go . She tried to get another job , but it was the same story everywhere  --  R.N. or nothing . She stopped looking for work and stayed home with Trish . She started drinking more . A little eye-opener in the morning . A little something with lunch . And then some serious drinking in the evening , We had to sell her V-Dub , so she could n't even meet me at the Hour Glass anymore . But I do n't think she even wanted to . The gypsy woman , Andrea , hung around the trailer all the time now , getting drunk with her on jug wine . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it after Lenny left , in a special job-training program . She only wanted to change her luck , do some good , make a little money . And for a while that 's what happened . But then they took it away from her . They just ripped it right out of her hands . Who could blame her for drinking ? <p> Across the highway , more gypsies showed up every day . Broken-down cars and trucks were parked all over the cornfield . News was spreading about the queen . Some of the gypsies were camped out in the hospital room and would n't let the regular doctors and nurses treat her . She did n't have much longer . <p> To make things worse , that winter was the hardest the valley 'd seen in twenty years . One morning we woke up to two feet of snow outside and the furnace dead . Like waking up in a deep freeze . Rachel was lying there staring at the ceiling . I could see her breath . Her lips were a little gray . Almost like she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not supposed to be like this . " <p> I went down the hall and kicked and swore at the furnace until I could get the pilot relit , but that was just the beginning . In the john I found two-inch plugs of ice poking out of the sink and bathtub drains . The whole plumbing system was rock solid with ice . Even the water in the toilet bowl had a skin of ice on it . I started outside with a hammer to bang on the pipes , but the door was frozen shut . I had to kick it open . <p> I crawled under the trailer  --  stray cats bawling and hissing at me from the dark corners  --  but no amount of banging on the pipes would free them up . Then I got a brainstorm . I saw an old bag of self-starting charcoal briquettes and lined them up under the pipe . The whole length of the trailer . I lit them hoping there would be enough flame to free up the pipe but not enough to burn down the trailer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sound of the water flowing , I felt like a goddamn genius . <p> I went back inside the trailer to brag to Rachel . She was standing by the front door in her bathrobe , aiming the blow dryer at the hinges . <p> They were iced up so bad the door would n't close . Her mouth was <p> hard line . <p> I told her how I worked on the pipe . I said , " What would you do without me ? " I was kidding . <p> She stared back at me with a dead flat look in her eye , like maybe she knew the exact answer to that question . Like it was me who brought the blizzard and got her laid off and made Lenny leave . Like it was my fault for everything . <p> All I ever wanted was a paycheck and a little peace . But things keep coming at you . They turn you around . <p> Later that day I was driving my truck up Madison , a hill that wo n't quit . My eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow , watching my clearance . There was barely a whisper between me and the parked cars . The engine was aching , overheated . I stopped at the top of the hill and waited for Sammy to put down his air guitar and toss off three bundles of papers . <p> At first I did n't know what was going on . I heard a sound like a big wind . Then the little window behind the cab was full of bright orange light . I set the brake hard and ran to the back of the truck . Somebody had thrown a bottle bomb inside . Thick black smoke whirled out of the truck and everywhere flames . Sammy was inside , his back to one wall , just staring at the fire , too scared to move . His eyebrows were singed off , and his hair was smoking . His face was bright red . He fought me when I tried to get him out . I had to slap him some . <p> When the firemen came and saw it was a Friedman truck , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paper tumbled across the icy ground . Black flakes of ash sailed over the housetops . <p> By now the paramedics had put Sammy on a stretcher . His eyes were big and scared . " Did my shirt get burned ? " he said , trying to look down at his Guns ' n Roses T-shirt . " It 's my brother 's . If it 's wrecked , he 'll kill me . " <p> They put him in the ambulance and drove him away . The firemen stood around in their black and yellow raincoats smoking and joking , watching my truck burn down . <p> I yelled , " I never did one fucking thing to you people ! " <p> They just stood there smiling . One of them flipped me off . <p> I walked all the way back to Friedman 's . I did n't even explain what happened . Just got in my car and went straight to the state store , then parked behind the Super Saver on Northampton , trying to calm down , trying to think . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailer . They were sitting at the kitchen table , a jug of red wine between them . The old woman was talking quietly . Her hands were lying open on top of the table . Rachel sat staring into them , shaking her head slightly , a dark look in her eye . When I walked in , they stopped talking and looked away , like I caught them planning a robbery . <p> All the taps in the trailer were trickling so the pipes would n't freeze again . The space heater was turned on its end and propped next to the hinges of the front door . Trish was in the crib , booming her heels against the mattress and crowing . <p> I said , " I 'm quitting my job . " <p> Rachel looked up and said , " So ? It was a shit job anyway . " Then she and Andrea looked at each other , their secret hanging in the air between them . I stood there feeling like a stranger . <p> " You got to be kidding , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " <p> She laughed . " Driving a truck ? " She laughed again , louder . There was nothing funny about that laugh . It put a million miles between us . She was trying to tell me something , to tell herself something maybe , something that would wipe away all our talk about strikes and nursing home zombies , something that would take her back to who she was before hard luck got ahold of her . <p> I said , " We need a drink . " <p> Rachel gave me a cockeyed smile and raised her glass . " I ' 11 drink to that . " <p> " Not here , " I said . " Out . " <p> Andrea said , " I 'll stay with Treesh . " It was the first time I ever really heard her talk out loud . Her voice was scratchy . Her accent was right out of a horror movie . <p> I drove us to the Hour Glass . We did n't say anything the whole way , not until we sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I 've been thinking about things . " I sipped my drink . <p> " What things ? " She was already drunk . So was I , for that matter . She looked at me from a long way off , like she was getting ready to laugh again . <p> " You do n't really want to know , " I said . <p> She turned back to her wine . " All right , suit yourself . " <p> I said , " Texas . " The echo of her laugh was still in my head . <p> wanted to hurt her for it . I was drunk and scared and stupid . " I 'm thinking a lot about Texas . " <p> She started chewing on the corner of her mouth . " Texas . " <p> " Yeah . Things are going on down there . I 'm just thinking , you know . But Texas , that 's one of the things I 'm thinking . " <p> Rachel set down her glass . " What about Texas ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could work on one of the oil rigs in Galveston Bay . " <p> " What do you know about oil ? " <p> " Do n't need to know a thing . It 's grunt work . A guy-I-know 's brother works on one . Six months he lives on the rig . He 's on the drill crew , those big diamond-point drills . It 's good money . He 's got a real house . He 's got a VCR . " <p> " What am I supposed to do in Texas ? " she said slowly . <p> " That 's what I 'm thinking , " I said nodding . " I 'm thinking maybe I could go on ahead and get us set up first . " <p> She did n't say anything . She just stared at me , her eyes ticking back and forth across my face . <p> " I know what you 're thinking , Rachel , but it is n't like that . I mean , why should you come down now when you can come down later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She took a sip of wine and looked at her face in the mirror behind the bar . <p> I said , " I 'll probably have to sleep in my car for a while . " <p> She set the glass down gently , then slid it slowly across the bar , to the back edge , a little over , farther . <p> I said , " Is that what you want for Trish ? Living in a car ? " <p> She shot me a look , and I knew I had gone too far . She shoved the glass over the side . It broke against the edge of the sink . The bartender rushed over . He was about to say something , but the look in her eye cooled him . <p> She stood up slowly , holding onto the bar rail . She clapped her other hand on my shoulder and said , " You have yourself a good old time , cowboy . " <p> " It 's not what  --  " <p> " Oh , shut up , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the snowy parking lot . <p> I grabbed her by the shoulder and turned her to me . Her eyes were shiny and hard . " I 'm not Lenny , Rachel . " That 's what I said , but I felt exactly like him . " I 'm just trying to do the best thing . " I thought it was the truth . I wanted to believe it . But she knew me too well . Me or the world . <p> She said , " Just go . Just leave me alone . " She pulled away and ran to the car , her boots slipping on the ice . <p> I yelled , " I was almost killed today ! " I held out my hands like a begging dog . I wanted her to see my cut-up knuckles and my forearms , red and stinging , the arm hairs burned all off . But my knuckles were healed , and my arms only looked sunburned . " Do you care ? No ! You do n't care ! " <p> She was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " <p> " You never cared about me ! " <p> " That 's right , scab ! You were nothing to me ! You hear ? Nothing ! " <p> " Fuck you ! " <p> " No , fuck you ! " <p> She stomped over to the passenger side of the car , dug out her keys , got inside , and flung the door shut . I dug out my set of keys and got in behind the wheel . We just sat there staring out at the snow whipping across the icy parking lot . <p> That 's when I think we maybe could have saved it . For a second I think we both saw how funny we looked , how ridiculous . But then the second was gone . We slid right past it . Rachel moved over against the passenger door . She stared out the side window as I drove us home through the frozen streets smoky with snow . <p> I thought about things . Like how after making love , she liked to whisper old songs to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked to take her for walks and tell her the names of stars and trees . I thought about these things and about all the other things that would never happen again . <p> It was late and cold when we got back . Rachel was out of the car before I even stopped . She ran into the trailer , then came outside with Andrea . At the end of our lane , they stepped over the guard rail and crossed the highway . They walked carefully through the frozen corn stubble . There were fewer cars in the gypsy camp now . I guess the queen was finally dead and they were moving on . Two more left while I stood there . One of them was the bus with bubble windows . When it drove past , I could see small lighted chandeliers swinging from the ceiling and oil paintings hanging on the walls . <p> I went into the trailer and poured myself another drink . I checked on Trish . She was sleeping scrunched up in the corner of her crib . I whispered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will we , little one ? " She 'd get over this , I figured . Hell , she was n't even a real person yet . Right ? I tried to remember where all my stuff was and what would be the quickest way to get it all together . Before I knew it , Rachel was back . She was yelling at me from outside . <p> " Andrea 's right ! " she yelled . She pronounced the name like it belonged to a movie star . " Ruin ! Ruin follows in your wake . " Her voice was shaky and full of crying . <p> I went outside yelling , " You think I like this ? " I flung my arm out at the trailer . " You think this is the way I want things to be ? " A light came on next door . <p> She 'd brought some gypsies with her . Andrea stood next to her on our cement slab . Behind them , two men stood in the shadows . She ran inside the trailer , leaving me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower bed I had dug around the slab last fall . It was ice and frozen mud now , but all I could think of was how I sifted that dirt through a wire screen and mixed it with compost . How I set the roots so the eyes were just below ground . In the spring there 'd be peonies where they were standing . <p> Trish 's eyes were big and dark and sleepy . Rachel had her wrapped in an old afghan . She held her tight against her chest . Then she gave her to the old woman . <p> I made a move towards Rachel . " What are you doing ? Do n't do this . " <p> One of the men slipped off into the darkness as soon as Rachel came out . I tried to see the other guy 's face but the shadows were too deep . I said , " Get the fuck off my peonies . " <p> He stepped forward , into the light from the open door . He was an old man in work clothes , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his left forearm was an open shotgun . I could see the butts of two shells in the breech . He pulled off his old felt hat with the other hand like he was about to apologize . He set the hat on top of the breech and took a packet of money out of it . <p> He turned to Rachel , his voice quiet . " We agreed to $5,000 ? " <p> Rachel looked down at her empty hands . I could hardly hear her when she said , " Yeah . " <p> The old man stepped closer to her . It was dark but I could see his right eye was bad . There was no pupil . What was left was like buttermilk . He held the money out to her . <p> She took it and said , " What about  --  ? " <p> He pointed to the icy , rutted lane that ran past the end of the trailer . <p> An engine started up . When the headlights came on , we could see the other gypsy sitting in a sportscar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The top was down . Once it was running , he got out , leaving the door open . <p> I said , " Rachel  --  Rache , you do n't know what you 're doing . You do n't want to be doing this . " <p> Her eyes were all red and sloppy . When she went inside the trailer , the old woman started to walk away with Trish . She said words to her in a language I could n't understand . <p> " Andrea , " I said . It was the first time I ever said her name , the first time I ever even spoke to her . I said her name the way Rachel said it . " Andrea , do n't  --  " I started to follow her , but the old man stepped out , jerking the shotgun shut . <p> I pointed at it and said , " What 's that ? What 's that for ? " <p> It was just the two of us now . He looked down like he was seeing the gun for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tops of the trailers . " This ? " he said , turning the gun barrel a little towards me . " This is nothing . This is for nothing . " <p> Rachel came out of the trailer with a packed suitcase and headed for the car . She threw the suitcase into the passenger seat . The door went chunk when she closed it . She gunned the engine a couple times . <p> " Rachel , " I yelled . " Trish  --  " <p> " You did this , " she yelled , stabbing at me with her finger . " You . " <p> That 's when I went for her . I did n't care about the shotgun anymore . I knocked the guy out of my way and went for her . She tried to shove the stick into first . I was almost on her when the back wheels spun against the ice and then caught . The car fishtailed as she took off , slamming sideways into some garbage cans . <p> I ran hard . Dogs were barking . Lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running . I thought I could catch her . She 'd have to slow down , the lane curved so much . But she just threw that car into every turn , snow and ice shooting up behind her . Never slowed for a second . <p> I kept running . My chest was tight . My teeth felt like they were shaking loose . She swung out of the trailer park and onto the highway . Then she opened it up , and I knew it was all over . She took third to the top and ran wide open into fourth . In a few seconds she was out of sight . I stood there beside the road with my hands on my knees , heaving . She really drove that car . I stood there for a long time , trying to catch my breath , as the howl of that engine faded into the dark . <p>
