<p> When Timothy Fuller , dean of Colorado College in Colorado Springs , and his colleagues took a no-holds-barred look at their school in the late 1960s , they decided it was time for a radical change . <p> " We said , let 's not tinker with the curriculum , " Dean Fuller recalls . " Let 's rethink the whole structure of learning . " <p> What emerged was an unusual and - in some eyes - still radical system : Students take one course at a time , a method sometimes called the block plan . They plunge themselves into one course for a few weeks , study intensively , take exams , then move on to a new course . At the end of the year they generally end up with the same number of credits they would have with the more typical four-or-five-course at-a-time approach . But it is a markedly different , and many say deeper , educational experience . <p> Growing interest among a range of educators and students has focused attention on this intensive method of studying . Proponents tout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one topic . Many also claim that the often high-pressure approach to learning offers experience that will be useful in meeting future work demands . <p> As a result , more colleges are considering it and in some cases adopting it - or a modified version , involving two or three courses at a time . Some independent schools are also trying it . <p> " I 'm thrilled that colleges are doing this , " says Russell Garth , executive vice president of the Council of Independent Colleges in Washington . " The arguments in their favor make sense , " he says , and the conditions they produce " play out that way in real life . I 've talked with a couple of colleges in the past few years who have been considering this , like Fiske . " <p> That historically black university in Nashville , Tenn. , entered into an exchange program with Cornell College in Mt . Vernon , Iowa , another pioneer of the one-course-at-a-time approach . " They wanted to inquire into this block scheduling approach , " says Mr. Garth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Undivided attention <p> The appeal of the system - for both students and some faculty - lies in the logic of focusing undivided attention on one subject . A student 's time is not fragmented among three of four other courses . It allows more depth and continuity of study , often giving students more time one-on-one with a professor or instructor . <p> " It eliminates time stealing , " Fuller points out , or scrimping on one course to accommodate the demands of another . " It also makes courses of less immediate interest to students more rewarding , because they 're not feeling burdened and worried that they really need to be doing something else . " <p> Ann O'Connell studied this way during a summer session at Mount St. Vincent University in Halifax . " We took a full year 's course in statistics in just six weeks . " It was great - as long as you did n't mind not doing much of anything else , " she recalls . <p> Now a spokeswoman for Keiser College , a small two-year institution in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here also we teach one course at a time - the ' modular curriculum . ' It lets students who have outside work and family responsibilities concentrate on a course for a short time . But it 's intense , " she adds . <p> The open blocks of time can also benefit student research . " You can do more with out-of-class experiences , " Garth says . " You can take one or two days and travel , because you 're not in conflict with other course schedules . " <p> According to Garth , students can also take advantage of visiting scholars who wo n't come for a whole semester but will visit the campus for several days . <p> These aspects of block plans " connect the college with the outside world , " Garth says . " In one case the students go out there , in the other you bring parts of the outside world in . " Faculty members too , he states , get a break , since " they 're not teaching every block , and the time in between is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science major who transferred to Colorado College , likes the fact that " there is no official class ' period . ' Discussion begins and ends when everyone is done talking . On the semester system , one complaint I had was that students , including myself , were always made somewhat anxious by extended class discussion . I was always worried that the professor would n't get to something that we would later find on an exam . " <p> Mr. Dickey recalls a friend who took a five-day field trip with his geology class to Canyonlands National Park . " There , the students took sketches of real rock formations . On a semester system ... they would have learned by seeing pictures in a textbook , or a little sample in a lab somewhere on campus , " he says . " My friend studied the rock as would a working geologist . " <p> Despite pockets of interest , however , the approach has not taken off . Fuller attributes that to traditional hesitation about new teaching methods . " It 's really the resistance of faculties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented it from being more widespread , " he says . <p> Teaching courses one at a time " is very demanding , " he observes . " When you 're teaching a small group of students - average class size here is 15 - on a daily basis in an immersion-like environment , you 're on the spot all the time . It 's for people who really like to be in the classroom . " <p> For students , also , it can be challenging . " Every day is like a week in the semester system , " Fuller notes . " Students learn to make every day count . They live in an environment somewhat more like when they go out and get a job . Alumni surveys single out the value for students in learning how to manage their time efficiently . " <p> Too intensive ? <p> The intensity can sometimes cause problems , however . Sarah Gibb , a physics major entering her senior year at Colorado College , says , " I 've found that some of the concepts - the theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . " <p> For the most part , she likes the approach . " I 've been able to really delve into my courses with my full energy , " she reports , " and my attention span and time-management skills have increased as a result . " But , she complains , " We do n't have as much time between classes to really grasp a complex idea . " <p> Both professors and students complained about this time-study issue as it affected science , and also some foreign languages , in a study of its block plan Colorado College did in 1994 . <p> Syracuse ( N.Y. ) University 's Robert M. Diamond , a leading authority on the design of college courses and curricula , stresses that the key is what students and faculty make of the one-course-at-a-time plan . " Is there enough active learning , " he asks , " small groups , quality faculty , enough time provided to complete assignments , enough flexibility ? " <p> A chorus of comments from former block-plan students indicate these questions are often answered in the positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrated the system in the early 1980s . <p> " I took one course for 3-1/2 weeks followed by a four-day weekend , " he says . " During these breaks , students often traveled , returned home , worked extra hours at a job , or spent time preparing for their next class . It was structured so that students were required to complete eight blocks each academic year . Nine blocks are offered . Some students took off Block 5 , just after Christmas , to extend their holiday vacation . Others took off Block 9 to get a jump-start on a summer job . " <p> The schedule , Mr. Van Danen says , allowed " students to work closely with one professor and a small gathering of students over the period of the class . The relationships that come from these intense sessions are long-lasting . " <p> And the experience readied him for graduate school at the University of Iowa , he claims . " Having been forced during earlier years to read books in a matter of days and write term papers over the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found graduate school to be much less challenging than expected . My study habits had adapted to the demands of a much more intense educational program . "
