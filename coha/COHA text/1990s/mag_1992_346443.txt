On the field , the pittsburgh pirates are one of the most successful teams in major league baseball . They finished first in the National League 's Eastern Division the past two seasons and came within one game of going to the World Series in 1991 . Yet the Pirates are perennial losers off the field . The club has chalked up losses totaling $13 million since 1989 , including $3 million in its division-winning season last year . The Pirates blame this paradox largely on soaring players ' salaries , which cost $24 million , or 52% of the club 's revenues , last year . To make ends meet , Pittsburgh cut more than $7 million from its payroll by trading 20-game winner John Smiley and letting slugger Bobby Bonilla become a free agent . <P> The Pirates are not the only team that is striking out financially . After years of booming ticket sales , record profits and lucrative television contracts , major league baseball has fallen into a slump . Stadium attendance is flat , payrolls are climbing , and revenues are on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several others , including the Detroit Tigers and Houston Astros , are being shopped around by cash-drained owners . Last week 's sale of the money-losing Seattle Mariners to a group headed by Japan 's Hiroshi Yamauchi , president of the video-gamemaker Nintendo , was the latest confirmation of the trend . <P> The most distressing news for fans is that club owners and the Players Association are once again preparing to do battle over their collective- bargaining agreement . Although the pact is scheduled to expire at the end of next year , financially strapped owners want to reopen the contract after this season . The clubs are demanding relief from escalating player salaries , but the players seek to maintain the contract that has created scores of millionaire athletes over the past decade . As a result , the uneasy truce worked out after the 1990 owners ' lockout is in danger of being discarded . " The golden days of baseball are over , " says Gerald Scully , University of Texas economist and author of The Business of Major League Baseball . " The game is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could spell big trouble for labor-management relations . Unless cooler heads prevail , the 1993 baseball season could be in jeopardy . " <P> After growing at an average annual rate of 4% during the 1980s , total attendance is not likely to match last season 's record-setting pace of 57 million . Television ratings have declined steadily since 1989 , when CBS and ESPN paid $1.5 billion for national broadcasting rights . The two broadcasters have lost $500 million on that deal so far , and will likely pay substantially less when they renew the contract this year . About half of the 26 teams , including the Oakland Athletics and Cleveland Indians , lost money in 1991 , and more clubs are expected to do so this year . There are even rumors of one or two franchises going bankrupt within the next few years .
