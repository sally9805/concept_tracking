14 April 1905 Suppose time is a circle , bending back on itself . The world repeats itself , precisely , endlessly . For the most part , people do not know they will live their lives over . Traders do not know that they will make the same bargain again and again . Politicians do not know that they will shout from the same lectern an infinite number of times in the cycles of time . Parents treasure the first laugh from their child as if they will not hear it again . Lovers making love the first time undress shyly , show surprise at the supple thigh , the fragile nipple . How would they know that each secret glimpse , each touch , will be repeated again and again and again , exactly as before ? On Marktgasse , it is the same . How could the shopkeepers know that each handmade sweater , each embroidered handkerchief , each chocolate candy , each intricate compass and watch will return to their stalls ? At dusk , the shopkeepers go home to their families or drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vaulted alleys , caressing each moment as an emerald on temporary consignment . How could they know that nothing is temporary , that all will happen again ? No more than an ant crawling round the rim of a crystal chandelier knows that it will return to where it began . In the hospital on Gerberngasse , a woman says goodbye to her husband . He lies in bed and stares at her emptily . In the lasttwo months , his cancer has spread from his throat to his liver , his pancreas , his brain . His two young children sit on one chair in the corner of the room , frightened to look at their father , his sunken cheeks , the withered skin of an old man . The wife comes to the bed and kisses her husband softly on the forehead , whispers goodbye , and quickly leaves with the children . She is certain that this was the last kiss . How could she know that time will begin again , that she will be born again , will study at the gymnasium again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will again meet her husband in the small library in Fribourg , will again go sailing with him in Thun Lake on a warm day in July , will give birth again , that her husband will again work for eight years at the pharmaceutical and come home one evening with a lump in his throat , will again throw up and get weak and end up in this hospital , this room , this bed , this moment . How could she know ? In the world in which time is a circle , every handshake , every kiss , every birth , every word , will be repeated precisely . So too every moment that two friends stop becoming friends , every time that a family is broken because of money , every vicious remark in an argument between spouses , every opportunity denied because of a superior 's jealousy , every promise not kept . And just as all things will be repeated in the future , all things now happening happened a million times before . Some few people in every town , in their dreams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These are the people with unhappy lives , and they sense that their misjudgments and wrong deeds and bad luck have all taken place in the previous loop of time . In the dead of night these cursed citizens wrestle with their bedsheets , unable to rest , stricken with the knowledge that they can not change a single action , a single gesture . Their mistakes will be repeated precisely in this life as in the life before . And it is these double unfortunates who give the only sign that time is a circle . For in each town , late at night , the vacant streets and balconies fill up with their moans. 16 April 1905 In this world , time is like a flow of water , occasionally displaced by a bit of debris , a passing breeze . Now and then , some cosmic disturbance will cause a rivulet of time to turn away from the mainstream , to make connection backstream . When this happens , birds , soil , people caught in the branching tributary find themselves suddenly carried to the past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to identify . They wear dark , indistinct clothing and walk on their toes , trying not to make a single sound , trying not to bend a single blade of grass . For they fear that any change they make in the past could have drastic consequences for the future . Just now , for example , such a person is crouching in the shadows of the arcade , at no. 19 Kramgasse . An odd place for a traveler from the future , but there she is . Pedestrians pass , stare , and walk on . She huddles in a corner , then quickly creeps across the street and cowers in another darkened spot , at no. 22 . She is terrified that she will kick up dust , just as a Peter Klausen is making his way to the apothecary on Spitalgasse this afternoon of 16 April 1905 . Klausen is something of a dandy and hates to have his clothes sullied . If dust messes his clothes , he will stop and painstakingly brush them off , regardless of waiting appointments . If Klausen is sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , who has been complaining of leg aches for weeks . In that case , Klausen 's wife , in a bad humor , may decide not to make the trip to Lake Geneva . And if she does not go to Lake Geneva on 23 June 1905 , she will not meet a Catherine d'pinay walking on the jetty of the east shore and will not introduce Mlle. d'pinay to her son Richard . In turn , Richard and Catherine will not marry on 17 December 1908 , will not give birth to Friedrich on 8 July 1912 . Friedrich Klausen will not be father to Hans Klausen on 22 August 1938 , and without Hans Klausen the European Union of 1979 will never occur . The woman from the future , thrust without warning into this time and this place and now attempting to be invisible in her darkened spot at no. 22 Kramgasse , knows the Klausen story and a thousand other stories waiting to unfold , dependent on the births of children , the movement of people in the streets , the songs of birds at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind . She crouches in the shadows and does not return the stares of people . She crouches and waits for the stream of time to carry her back to her own time . When a traveler from the future must talk , he does not talk but whimpers . He whispers tortured sounds . He is agonized . For if he makes the slightest alteration in anything , he may destroy the future . At the same time , he is forced to witness events without being part of them , without changing them . He envies the people who live in their own time , who can act at will , oblivious of the future , ignorant of the effects of their actions . But he can not act . He is an inert gas , a ghost , a sheet without soul . He has lost his personhood . He is an exile of time . Such wretched people from the future can be found in every village and every town , hiding under the eaves of buildings , in basements , under bridges , in deserted fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future marriages , births , finances , inventions , profits to be made . Instead , they are left alone and pitied. 19 April 1905 It is a cold morning in November and the first snow has fallen . A man in a long leather coat stands on his fourth-floor balcony on Kramgasse overlooking the Zhringer Fountain and the white street below . To the east , he can see the fragile steeple of St. Vincent 's Cathedral , to the west , the curved roof of the Zytgloggeturm . But the man is not looking east or west . He is staring down at a tiny red hat left in the snow below , and he is thinking . Should he go to the woman 's house in Fribourg ? His hands grip the metal balustrade , let go , grip again . Should he visit her ? Should he visit her ? He decides not to see her again . She is manipulative and judgmental , and she could make his life miserable . Perhaps she would not be interested in him anyway . So he decides not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company of men . He works hard at the pharmaceutical , where he hardly notices the female assistant manager . He goes to the brasserie on Kochergasse in the evenings with his friends and drinks beer , he learns to make fondue . Then , in three years , he meets another woman in a clothing shop in Neuchtel . She is nice . She makes love to him very very slowly , over a period of months . After a year , she comes to live with him in Berne . They live quietly , take walks together along the Aare , are companions to each other , grow old and contented . In the second world , the man in the long leather coat decides that he must see the Fribourg woman again . He hardly knows her , she could be manipulative , and her movements hint at volatility , but that way her face softens when she smiles , that laugh , that clever use of words . Yes , he must see her again . He goes to her house in Fribourg , sits on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grows weak at the sight of the white of her arms . They make love , loudly and with passion . She persuades him to move to Fribourg . He leaves his job in Berne and begins work at the Fribourg Post Bureau . He burns with his love for her . Every day he comes home at noon . They eat , they make love , they argue , she complains that she needs more money , he pleads with her , she throws pots at him , they make love again , he returns to the Post Bureau . She threatens to leave him , but she does not leave him . He lives for her , and he is happy with his anguish . In the third world , he also decides that he must see her again . He hardly knows her , she could be manipulative , and her movements hint at volatility , but that smile , that laugh , that clever use of words . Yes , he must see her again . He goes to her house in Fribourg , meets her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen table . They talk of her work at the library , his job at the pharmaceutical . After an hour , she says that she must leave to help a friend , she says goodbye to him , they shake hands . He travels the thirty kilometers back to Berne , feels empty during the train ride home , goes to his fourth-floor apartment on Kramgasse , stands on the balcony and stares down at the tiny red hat left in the snow . These three chains of events all indeed happen , simultaneously . For in this world , time has three dimensions , like space . Just as an object may move in three perpendicular directions , corresponding to horizontal , vertical , and longitudinal , so an object may participate in three perpendicular futures . Each future moves in a different direction of time . Each future is real . At every point of decision , whether to visit a woman in Fribourg or to buy a new coat , the world splits into three worlds , each with the same people but with different fates for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of worlds . Some make light of decisions , arguing that all possible decisions will occur . In such a world , how could one be responsible for his actions ? Others hold that each decision must be considered and committed to , that without commitment there is chaos . Such people are content to live in contradictory worlds , so long as they know the reason for each . 24 April 1905 In this world , there are two times . There is mechanical time and there is body time . The first is as rigid and metallic as a massive pendulum of iron that swings back and forth , back and forth , back and forth . The second squirms and wriggles like a bluefish in a bay . The first is unyielding , predetermined . The second makes up its mind as it goes along . Many are convinced that mechanical time does not exist . When they pass the giant clock on the Kramgasse they do not see it ; nor do they hear its chimes while sending packages on Postgasse or strolling between flowers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only as ornaments or as courtesies to those who would give timepieces as gifts . They do not keep clocks in their houses . Instead , they listen to their heartbeats . They feel the rhythms of their moods and desires . Such people eat when they are hungry , go to their jobs at the millinery or the chemist 's whenever they wake from their sleep , make love all hours of the day . Such people laugh at the thought of mechanical time . They know that time moves in fits and starts . They know that time struggles forward with a weight on its back when they are rushing an injured child to the hospital or bearing the gaze of a neighbor wronged . And they know too that time darts across the field of vision when they are eating well with friends or receiving praise or lying in the arms of a secret lover . Then there are those who think their bodies do n't exist . They live by mechanical time . They rise at seven o'clock in the morning . They eat their lunch at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their appointments on time , precisely by the clock . They make love between eight and ten at night . They work forty hours a week , read the Sunday paper on Sunday , play chess on Tuesday nights . When their stomach growls , they look at their watch to see if it is time to eat . When they begin to lose themselves in a concert , they look at the clock above the stage to see when it will be time to go home . They know that the body is not a thing of wild magic , but a collection of chemicals , tissues , and nerve impulses . Thoughts are no more than electrical surges in the brain . Sexual arousal is no more than a flow of chemicals to certain nerve endings . Sadness no more than a bit of acid transfixed in the cerebellum . In short , the body is a machine , subject to the same laws of electricity and mechanics as an electron or clock . As such , the body must be addressed in the language of physics . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of so many levers and forces . The body is a thing to be ordered , not obeyed . Taking the night air along the river Aare , one sees evidence for two worlds in one . A boatman gauges his position in the dark by counting seconds drifted in the water 's current . " One , three meters . Two , six meters . Three , nine meters . " His voice cuts through the black in clean and certain syllables . Beneath a lamppost on the Nydegg Bridge , two brothers who have not seen each other for a year stand and drink and laugh . The bell of St. Vincent 's Cathedral sings ten times . In seconds , lights in the apartments lining Schifflaube wink out , in a perfect mechanized response , like the deductions of Euclid 's geometry . Lying on the riverbank , two lovers look up lazily , awakened from a timeless sleep by the distant church bells , surprised to find that night has come . Where the two times meet , desperation . Where the two times go their separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a nurse , a baker can make a world in either time , but not in both times . Each time is true , but the truths are not the same .
