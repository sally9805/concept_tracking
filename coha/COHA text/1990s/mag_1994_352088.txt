For the big three online services  --  CompuServe , Prodigy and America Online  --  this was the year it all fell into place . The computers were cheap . The modems were fast . The infohighway buzzwords were on everybody 's lips . " It 's like Mars and Jupiter coming into alignment , " says Maurice Cox , president of CompuServe , the largest ( 2.25 million subscribers ) of the field . Upstart America Online grew at such a rapid clip  --  an extraordinary 200% in the past 12 months  --  that subscribers complained of busy signals and its stock was whipsawed by takeover rumors ( the most recent : that cable-TV mogul John Malone wants to buy a big stake ) . Even Prodigy , the troubled online service that has reportedly swallowed $1 billion of its co-owners ' ( IBM and Sears ) shrinking capital , seems to have turned the corner and is finally showing a profit . <P> But would n't you know , just when the money is starting to roll in , the foundation on which the Big Three built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tough new competitors are looming on the horizon , some 40,000 small local and regional systems are coming from behind , and  --  most ominously  --  the whole idea of competing commercial computer networks is being undermined by the network that connects them all : the Internet . " Do n't look now , " warns the headline on an Internet article in the current issue of Wired magazine , " but Prodigy , AOL and CompuServe are suddenly obsolete . " <P> Until quite recently , the Internet offered no serious competition . Developed as a research network with no central management system , it was sprawling , unruly , disorganized and almost impossible to navigate . Getting around the Net was like trying to find your way in a foreign city where the streets have no signs , maps are nonexistent , and the locals do n't much cotton to strangers ' asking questions . <P> The big online services , by contrast , are the shopping malls of cyberspace . They are designed to provide all the goods and information services any paying customer might want  --  under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of news and information sources , thousands of databases , tens of thousands of free computer programs and plenty of gathering places where fellow subscribers can get together to chat . With a single telephone call , you can read the news , look up a stock quote , give some advice , make a friend , book a flight , check the weather , buy a raincoat and order a bunch of flowers . <P> You would find a lot of the same things on the Internet , but you would have to know where to look . And because the Internet is a decentralized network rather than a single computer system , you have to make a fresh connection to a remote machine every time you want to get something done . As long as getting around the Net required memorizing computer addresses and mastering programs with names such as FTP and Telnet , most computer users preferred to window- shop at the online malls.
