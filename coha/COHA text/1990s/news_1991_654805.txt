<p> GERMANY , watching the postwar era fade into history , is struggling to redefine its role in the world . <p> Reunification started this process . But lawmakers , journalists , and political analysts here say that it is actually coalition criticism of Germany 's nonparticipation in the Gulf war which is speeding it up . <p> Now that Germany is reunited and fully sovereign , it must take on more responsibility internationally , especially in global security , says Chancellor Helmut Kohl . <p> But becoming a nation among equals is a difficult transition . It means a sea change - dropping the postwar status of Germany as " economic giant , political dwarf , and military worm , " as Wilhelm Hortmann wrote recently in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper . <p> Professor Hortmann 's nearly full-page article , " What it means to be German , " is just one among a multitude in the press as Germans try to sort out what Germany 's responsibility to the world is . <p> In another leading conservative newspaper , Die Welt , political scientist Hans-Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " big debate " has begun on how long , and at what price , the Germans can afford isolationism . <p> Meanwhile , the leading newspaper on the left , Die Zeit , argued in mid-March that the Gulf war victory was " dubious " and that Germans were thankfully not military participants . " Let them call us dodgers , " wrote Marion Grafin Donhoff . " What do we care ? " <p> The national debate on Germany 's world role is also taking place in the Bundestag , or parliament . The issue there is how to change the German Constitution to allow out-of-NATO-area deployment of German troops . In the Gulf war , the Germans said their Constitution prevented them from deploying troops to the region . <p> Far from being a merely technical question , say lawmakers , military policy is the last hurdle on the road to German normalcy in international affairs . <p> " It 's the last difficulty , " says Bundestag member Rupert Scholz , a former defense minister under Mr. Kohl . Germany is complete in all other ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an economic and political motor in Europe . <p> The issue is also seen as a litmus test for Bonn vis-a-vis its allies . " A lot of German credibility rides on this , " says Thomas Kielinger , editor-in-chief of the weekly Rheinischer Merkur . Aligning Germany 's security policy with that of its European partners is essential if Europe is going to follow through on political union , says Mr. Kielinger . In the next conflict , Germany 's allies will expect more than a check . <p> The responses to the out-of-area question reflect the degrees to which Germans are prepared to launch into new waters . <p> The Social Democrats ( SPD ) , the opposition on the left , have the most limiting approach . For the moment , they agree that the German Army could take part in United Nations peacekeeping missions , but only under UN command and control . <p> The centrist Free Democrats , Kohl 's junior coalition partner , go a step further and support UN-sanctioned excursions , even if they are not under UN command . This would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation in which the United States was the clear leader . <p> Kohl , who leads the Christian Democrats ( CDU ) , takes the most wide-reaching position of all , which would permit German troops to participate not only in UN-sanctioned cases , but also in European-sanctioned ones . <p> An odd twist is that many legal experts and politicians , reportedly including Kohl himself , do not believe that the Constitution restricts German troop deployments to the NATO area only . <p> " The false interpretation of the Constitution reflects the state of political awareness in this country , " says Mr. Scholz . <p> It reflects the postwar aversion to the idea of Germany as a military and political heavyweight . It also reflects 40 years of fixation on the East-West conflict , in which the only military engagement Germans could imagine was a defensive one on their own soil . <p> The restrictive interpretation , meanwhile , has now become political reality , says Scholz . The reason Kohl thinks it is necessary to change the Constitution , he says , is not only to clarify it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the US learned in Vietnam , sending troops abroad without the backing of the people leads to political disaster . <p> Karsten Voigt , the SPD 's authority on security issues in the Bundestag , argues that considerable consensus has already been reached on the out-of-area question . <p> " Two or three years ago , it was a minority position to discuss even ( German participation in ) UN peacekeeping forces , " he says . <p> In the long-run , Mr. Voigt argues , Germany " is well advised " to move toward participation in engagements that are not just restricted to UN command , as the SPD proposes . But Germany " must go slowly , " he warns . Germans , as well as countries such as France and Britain , are wary of militaristic thinking redeveloping in Germany , says Voigt . <p> " The world does not want to rediscover what good soldiers the Germans can be , " said Richard von Weizsacker , Germany 's widely respected president , in an interview in Die Zeit last month . <p> This is an outdated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say we 're not to be trusted , we 'll only feed the distrust . " Over the last 40 years , Germany has proved itself , he says . Now , he adds , Germany is using its Constitution as an excuse to let others do the dirty work . <p> Political observers in Bonn say it will take two to five years for the Germans to resolve the out-of-area issue . With the Gulf war over , the pressure is certainly off , although neither the march toward European union , nor Germany 's allies , will let the Germans postpone the question indefinitely , they say . <p> The process of thinking about it has begun , though Voigt argues that the security issue is not the only identity question the Germans face . " There is the problem of our identity as the German nation , " he says , the coming together of the haves and have-nots , of two different societies . It looks like this question will take much longer to answer than that of Germany 's world role .
